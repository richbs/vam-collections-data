The sitter was the Rector of the Parish of Bethnal Gren from about 1862 to his death in June 1895.  According to a letter on the RPs \"My father was the originator of the B G Museum.  The ground on which it stands was part of the old \"Bethnal Green\", at this time it was owned by a charity  - part had been given to build St John's Church as a \"Chapel of Ease\" to his Parish Church (St Matthew) and a portion at the South end leased for a private lunatic asylum.  The green was enclosed and rents were collected from butchers who put their sheep there ready for killing when wanted.  My father with two friends (whose names I forget) raised a public subscription to purchase the green with the object of its being used for building a branch of S. Kensington Museum - the rest to be laid out as a public garden; and when they had collected the necessary amount the land was handed over to Government\"",
