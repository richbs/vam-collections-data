It shows 'C'- and 'S'-shaped scrolls that are not symmetrical, together with floral and leafy decoration and rocaille, a shell-like decorative element represented here by a ridged effect. This style was first fashionable in France between 1740 and 1770. It was revived in Britain in the 1820s and 1830s.\n\nPeople\nThe firm of Cope and Timmins was established about 1760. They had addresses in both London and Birmingham, with Birmingham being specified by 1890 as the manufactory. The firm is still in business today (2001), producing brass fittings.\n\nDesign & Designing\nDecorative brass fittings for furniture were among the staple products of the Birmingham and London brass founders during the 18th and 19th centuries. An enormous range of decorative furniture fittings was available and many of the same patterns recur. During the 18th century there was no registered right to any design in England, and manufacturers borrowed freely from each other, whereas in Paris metalworkers enjoyed the protection of their guilds and, after 1766, were able to protect their patterns by law. Popular patterns were supplied by a large number of manufacturers and persisted for many years.",
