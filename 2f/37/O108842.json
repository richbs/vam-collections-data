It is painted in the new, more realistic style that was often used for imaginary portraits of religious figures in the reign of Nasir al-Din Shah (ruled 1848\u20131896). \n\nHe was a member of the Qajar dynasty and also a great patron of portraiture. In his time, Iranian artists trained in Europe, where the Shah travelled on several occasions.\n\nThe Qajar dynasty reunited Iran in the 1790s and ruled until 1925. At the beginning of their reign, Iran had been isolated for many years. Soon contact with the outside world was re-established, and over time Qajar art began to reflect developments elsewhere, such as the use of photography by painters.",
