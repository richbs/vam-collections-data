He was known to paint many such sketches from nature, often completing them in a matter of hours, and they have been praised for their originality. Thomson was a successful, Scottish landscapist who was also minister for Duddingston from 1805. He was a close friend of the writer Sir Walter Scott (1771-1832), who was an important influence on his work, and collaborated with J.M.W. Turner (1775-1851) to produce illustrations for Scott\u2019s Provincial Antiquities and Picturesque Scenery of Scotland (1826).",

He contrasts the dark foliage of the foreground trees with the bluish-white of the lake and distant mountains and, in doing so, conveys a sense of mood, as well as recession. \n\nThomson painted many such sketches from nature of his native Scotland and was known to work quickly, often completing a sketch in a matter of hours. He was interested in the power of association with Scotland\u2019s literary and historic past, and his expressive, vigorous style evoked the mood of a landscape as opposed to its topographical features. His small sketches in particular, have been much praised in this regard. \n\nThomson was a successful, Scottish landscapist who was also minister of Duddingston from 1805. He was influenced by the Old Masters, including Claude Lorrain (c.1604-82), but also produced works of real originality, such as his small oil sketches. He was a close friend of Sir Walter Scott (1771-1832), who was another influence on his work, and collaborated with J.M.W. Turner (1775-1851) to produce illustrations, which were later engraved, for Scott\u2019s <i>Provincial Antiquities and Picturesque Scenery of Scotland</i> (1826).",
