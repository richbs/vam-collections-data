Lined with pink cotton. \nEmbroidered with two of the Stories of filial piety.\nAt the top is depicted a scene from the story of Kiang She and his wife Chang She, of the period of the Han dynasty. They devoted themselves to the care of Kiang she's old mother. The old lady was fond of the drinking water from a certain river, and of raw fish from the same place, which was a considerable distance from their house, but they daily made the journey to gratify her fancy. At last rewarded them by causing a spring to appear near their house which yielded two carp every day. The scene shows Chang She returning to the house with two pails of water. The river and mountains appear in the distance. Below is Yen Tsze who lived during the Chou dynasty. his mother suffered from an eye disease for which the milk of deer was the only remedy, so he went to the forest to get some, disguising himself in the hide of a deer so as to be able to mingle with him, but having heard his story, they let him go free.",
