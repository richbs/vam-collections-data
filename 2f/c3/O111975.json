The play concerned the characters Richard Jelf (of Jelf's Bank) who was engaged to Lady Fenella Mull, who had been engaged to Jim Palliser (of Palliser's Bank). Gerald Du Maurier starred as Jelf, directed the play, and also managed the theatre with Frank Curzon.  Seven years before, Gerald Du Maurier had played Captain Hook in the original production of Peter Pan and his head appears on the obverse of the token, in place of the king's head which would have appeared on contemporary coins.\n\nAdvertising tokens such as these were effective publicity tools for the theatre in the 19th century.  Struck with the name of the theatre and the play, they could be left on the street where people would be sure to pick them up, thinking they were coins.  Pasting up posters or handing out printed flyers was far more time-consuming than literally throwing your advertising onto the ground.  An advertising coin was also an appropriate way to advertise a play about banking!",
