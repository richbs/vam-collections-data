The main fabric is seamed down the middle.  It has a pink ground which had faded from red  [except for one area where there might have been a museum label]. It is closely covered with off-set rows of an upright sprig worked with gold thread [gold strip open S-wound on a yellow silk core].  \nThere is a wide border, pieced in many places, in which a pink satin stripe with a curving leaf motif at widely-spaced intervals woven with gold thread [silver strip or silver-gilt strip open S-wound on yellow silk core] alternates with a dark blue stripe almost entirely covered with the same metal thread and with yellow silk to form diagonal leaves with a rosette inside a net-like compartment. In some sections a third stripe pattern forms a honeycomb design with dark blue ovals containing a flower.\nBacking: attached so that the pattern is sideways. Dark brown ground with an off-set pattern of almost oval botehs facing to the right formed by 2 outer leaves of tiny flowers and filled with equally small flowers.\nFacing: bias cut blue satin.",
