            "public_access_description": "This piece is part of the Royal College of Art Visiting Artists Collection. Every year from 1987 to 2006, while David Watkins was Professor of Goldsmithing, Silversmithing, Metalwork and Jewellery at the RCA, he invited four jewellers and silversmiths from outside Britain to give a week-long masterclass. The artists brought diverse skills, aesthetics and approaches. The first call on their time was to interact closely with the students. In addition, although concentrating on their teaching and working in an unfamiliar studio, each artist generously made an object for the RCA's collection. The Royal College of Art Visiting Artists Collection, now transferred to the V&A, is a major document of international contemporary jewellery, a tribute both to the artists and to the vibrancy of the RCA as a teaching institution.\n\nDiego Piazza (1950-95) was first a student and later a teacher at the Instituto Statale d'Arte 'Pietro Selvatico' in Padua. This ring cleverly combines rectangle, triangle and circle in its design, while showing the sensitivity to gold that Paduan jewellers are noted for. It stands as a miniature sculpture when not being worn, an aspect of contemporary jewellery design which he also explored through larger sculptures which had within them detachable pieces of jewellery.",
