Karel Urb\u00e1nek, a previously unknown party member and chairman of the Party Executive Committee of Czechoslovakia, replaced Milo\u0161 Jake\u0161. \n\nThis xeroxed leaflet distributed by striking students around the country presents the relatively young, but \u2018old thinking\u2019 new general secretary Karel Urb\u00e1nek (who lasted less than a month in the position). A bubble-creature called \u2018URBJAKE\u0160\u2019 is spreading from his lips (composed of half the face of Urb\u00e1nek and half the face of Jake\u0161).  The text under the picture imparts information about Urbanek\u2019s political opinion that was published in the newspaper \u2018Svobodn\u00e9 slovo\u2019 on the 23rd of November:\n\n\u2018Extraordinary Session - Party Executive Committee, 23. 11. 1989\nPrague (CTK) \u2013 The Party Executive Committee of the CSR [Czech Socialist Republic] yesterday discussed the current political situation in the CSR during its extraordinary session lead by chairman  Karel Urb\u00e1nek. The Committee fully supports the speech of the \u00daV KSC [Central Committee, Communist Party of Czechoslovakia] general secretary M. Jake\u0161, showing realistically how to overcome the current difficult situation in our country.\u2019\n\n\nDesigned, printed and published in former Czechoslovakia",
