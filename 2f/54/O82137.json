We do not know who this artist was, but he or she signed three other miniatures in the V&A.\n\nThis one is a portrait after Samuel Cooper's miniature of John Holles, 2nd Earl of Clare, which is in a private collection at Welbeck Abbey in England. The Cooper miniature is signed and dated 1656. It is closely related to two large oil paintings, also at Welbeck Abbey. One is a three-quarter-length portrait in armour, and the other a derivative of it, a three-quarter length in peer's robes, by Maria Verelst.",

This frame was supplied for the miniature after it entered the Museum; the miniature was recorded by Jonathan Mayne on receipt as being in a 'gilded, carved wooden frame', which has now disappeared. \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> H E Backer (the dealer), from whom purchased, September 1952. \n\n<b>Literature:</b> <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981 p. 37. \n\nUnusually for D M this is a fully finished miniature. It was acquired and catalogued by the Museum as a portrait of an unknown man. Identification was by Robert Bayne- Powell, in January 1976, who commented: 'This is certainly a portrait <i>after</i> Cooper's <i>John Holles, 2nd Earl of Clare</i>'. (1) The latter is at Welbeck Abbey (2) and had recently been illustrated in the catalogue of (but not shown in) the Cooper exhibition; (3) it is signed and dated 1656 and is closely related to two paintings in large at Welbeck Abbey, a three-quarter length in armour, and a derivative of it, a three-quarter length in peer's robes, by Maria Verelst. (4) D M's version was not necessarily made in or near 1656 but could perfectly well have been copied later, during the period of the artist's otherwise known activity. \n\nJohn Holles, 2nd Earl of Clare, was born on 13 June 1595. He was MP for East Retford 1623-6, was knighted at Greenwich on 2 June 1625, succeeded to the earldom on 4 October 1637, and was Lord Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire in the Parliamentary interest in 1 642. He is said to have favoured a reconciliation between King and Parliament, and having supported the Restoration in 1660, his family prospered uninterruptedly. Cooper and D M catch him in sober Cromwellian armour, though he is not known to have been an active soldier. \n\n1 MS note c. 1975 in departmental file. \n2 Goulding 1914-15,p.85, no.58. \n3 Foskett NPG 1974, p.30. \n4 Goulding 1914-15, nos. 504 and 458 respectively.\" ",
