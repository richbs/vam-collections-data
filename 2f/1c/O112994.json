Both the bezel and the back, which is glazed, are mounted with a narrow band of tortoiseshell decorated with piqu\u00e9 work consisting of gilt metal rosettes.  A twisted wire runs around the edge of the tortoiseshell next to the rim of the back of the case.  A similar twisted wire on the bezel is now largely lacking.  The tortoiseshell of back and bezel is lined with pink silk.  \n[Watch] Quarter-repeating watch with varicoloured gold and enamel case.  The back of the case is painted with a polychrome enamel depicting the family of Coriolanus pleading with him to spare Rome, adapted from a painting by Charles de la Fosse which was engraved by H. S. Thomassin in 1723.  Around the scene run sprays of green enamel leaves interspersed with diamonds on a matted ground and an outer band of green gold foliage also applied on a matted ground.  On the bezel a similar band of green gold foliage runs outside a circle of diamonds which border the glass.  Convex white enamel dial with Roman numerals I - XII, arabic minutes 5 - 60, and minute marks. Winding hole inside II.  Inscribed on the dial 'Jean Fazy'.  Pierced silver hands set with diamond sparks, the minute hand with rococo asymmetric scroll.  Quarter-repeating movement has brass plates and cylindrical pillars. Going train with fusee and chain, verge escapement, brass balance wheel,steel spring, regulator of Tompion type but with fixed silve dial marked R[etard] (slow) and A[vance] (fast) and brass index.  Pierced and engraved bridge balance-cock composed of rococo foliage scrolls.  Two bell hammers.  Silver bell mounted inside case.",

            "public_access_description": "Geneva has been celebrated since the second half of the seventeenth century for its enamelled watches.  Jean Fazy (1737-94), whose name is on the dial and the movement, is well-known for his pair-cased watches (watches with an additional outer case) decorated with enamel and gemstones.  Pair-cases were standard on London-made watches for much of the eighteenth century and the use of them here suggests the influence of London watchmaking which had a high reputation in  Europe in the eighteenth century.\n\nThe scene on this case derives from an engraving by H. S. Thomassin published in 1723 after a painting by Charles de la Fosse of Veturia and Volumnia before Coriolanus.  The composition has been simplified so that only the wife of Coriolanus and one of his children are present, rather than his wife and mother and two children as depicted by Charles de la Fosse.   \n\nThe scene is here given a neo-classical setting by being painted within a circle bordered on both back and bezel  by tightly-bound wreaths of laurel.  There is slightly more freedom to the enamelled sprays of foliage immediately outside the scene, but they remain symmetrical.  However, the hands of the watch, particularly the minute hand which has a C curve and is asymmetrical, and the asymmetrical scrolls on the bridgecock of the movement, show that the watch is in transition from the rococo style to the neo-classical.  By the standards of Paris gold boxes, neo-classicism was dominant by 1763, so it seems likely that this watch was probably made during the 1760s.",
