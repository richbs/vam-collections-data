The rest of the field contain small dark diamonds and blue, black or white geometric motifs. \nThe upper and lower borders contain arrow-like blocks in all the colours.  The side borders contain inward facing right-angled triangles in blue, black and white with small diamonds in blue or red.\nWhen displayed and illustrated the blue ground square has been in the upper part of the panel.This panel has been displayed by the V&A as a 'rug' - its precise function is not known and in all probability it was not intended to have only one function.",
