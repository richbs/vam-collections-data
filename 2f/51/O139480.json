By the first half of the 19th century it was the main centre of production for small silver items in the region.  The silversmiths specialised in popular and devotional jewellery.  They sold their work at markets throughout the Alpine region, and at major international trade fairs all over Europe.  \n\nAlmost everyone in the town was involved in this production.  Many of the filigree pieces were put together by home workers, including women and children.  This kept costs down, and allowed the silversmiths to sell their goods at a low price.  \n\nMen's hats in south Germany traditionally had a wide brim and high crown.  The owner added a broad ribbon round the base of the crown to decorate it, fastened at the side with a silver filigree buckle, like this one.  It would originally have had an iron bar in the centre, with a prong to fasten it.  Glass pastes imitating precious stones (in this case garnets) are typical of jewellery from the south German region.",
