            "physical_description": "Ladder-backed chair with front legs, back stiles, top rail, three bars and shoe, and four stretchers all of mahogany. Seat is dished with the back and front seat rails concave on the top (and also curved on the bottom). \nFour seat rails possibly oak or ash, back rail veneered in mahogany. Back and side stretchers joined to the stiles and legs by bare-faced tenons. The middle stretcher is joined to the side stretchers by a stopped, sliding, half dovetail slid in from the bottom and stopped at the top. The back stiles have chamfered inside front corners in the leg section. The seat rails are tenoned in to the front legs and back stiles. The back stiles are tenoned to the top rail and the bars appear to be joined by back-level bare-faced tenons. The shoe is pinned down to the back seat rail over the upholstery.\n\nThe front left corner has its original brace (oak or ash like the seat rails) which appears to be keyed in at both corners. The front right brace has been replaced by a modern pine ogee block and there is a key in the front rail where the original brace was but the side rail oddly seems just to have a scored line, rather than a proper key. The seat upholstery is now supported from underneath by a board supported in ledges that are pinned to the rails and to the back face of the front left open corner brace. The ledge behind the centre part of the front seat rail is now missing. How was the board inserted without disturbing the brace?\n\nCurious nail holes running from top of seat to top of middle bar up the outer face of both stiles  and also along the back face of the back seat rail. Ghost of label formerly glued to the back face of the back seat rail.\n\nFront seat rail has a patch on the bottom edge of the front face, right hand end, 9 cm long.\n\nNow with brass castors (which may be original) on circular plates screwed up to the back legs with no recess. No pegging in the construction at all.\n\nEvidence for possibile regional manufacture is the use of oak or ash seat rails and the lack of any shaping to the top of the stretchers.\n\nUpholstery: foundation of 1\u00bd-chevron webbing, 3.2 cm wide, linen(?) weft and hemp(?) warp (can't see how many each way with board underneath) and a plain-weave hemp(?) base cloth. Straw lip or edge roll on front and sides under a linen(?) (finely woven) stuffing cover, side lips covered first and then front lip on top. A main stuffing of black and white horsehair and a top stuffing cover of loosely woven (?) plain weave linen. Remnants of the original horsehair nailed to the outer face of the front right leg. Left half of seat given new calico stuffing cover and new haircloth top cover with two rows of brass nails, close nailed, following the original nailing pattern.",
