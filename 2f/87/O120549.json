The PL table is typical of French furniture of the period, which dissolved traditional forms (in this instance, the kind of small table known as a gueridon) into an interplay of geometrical planes. The manufacturer of the table was Neotu, a gallery founded in 1985, dedicated to issuing editions of furniture and design objects, with premises in Paris and New York. One of the first exhibitions at Neotu was a solo show of work by Martin Szekely.",

Since the 18th century this term has described a low, circular table with three legs or tripod base while in the 20th century it has come to be used for what is called, in English, an occational table. Sleek, hi-tech in feel, although slightly let down by the quality of the welding, its minimalism is very much of its period. The table is eminently functional and has continued in small series of batch production since its original design in 1985.",
