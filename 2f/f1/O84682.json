The tracery on both sides is carved and the mullions moulded.On the inside face there are still traces of decorated plaster-work. The rebates on the interior faces must have been for shutters. It has been pointed out (Cescinsky and Gribble 1922, 52-53) that these window-frames again demonstrate that ceilinged rooms at this time must have been very low, even in timber houses of the more elaborate kind.  The height of this exceptionally fine window is less than 1.8m.  Even allowing for the cutting of the lower parts of the up-rights, where they rested in the wall-plate, the total height of the room cannot have been more than 2.1m. Fifteenth century doors made for secular timber-framed houses are rarely over 1.8m in height.",
