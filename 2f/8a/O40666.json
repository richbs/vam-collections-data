On the head is an elaborate hat with a broad black straight brim and an exaggeratedly serrated crown in dark Indian red edged in blue, from inside whcih spring straight black 'feathers' and bright mauve 'ostrich' plumes.  From the waist of the fitted black bodice rise two narrow dark Indian points.  The fitted sleeves are in black and bright mauve vertical stripes ending in a bold blue cuff. The ankle length skirt is divided into three areas, a hip band in bright mauve the lower edge cut into points from which hangs a panel in Indian red cut into exaggerated long points and reaching nearly to the hem of the black underskirt. Beside the word 'Reveller' is a rough sketch of a crown.",
