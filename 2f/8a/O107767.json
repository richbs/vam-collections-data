Lotus petals forming the border connect the goddess, otherwise known as 'Kamala', with the plant. This ritual object is used in the celebration of Lakshmi, the Goddess of Wealth and Fortune, on 'Kojagari Purnima', the autumnal full moon night following the Durga Puja festival. The 'sara' is placed with other offerings during the worship and subsequently it is hung up as good omen.",

Alpanas are painted on the ground showing worldly requirements and the 'sara' is placed on a wooden stool with various offerings, see Das [1953], p.24. Subsequently the 'sara' is hung up as decoration, (Dutta [1934], pp.28-9). In this example the goddess Lakshimi is depicted seated above her vehicle the owl and surrounded by her attendants. An earthen pot containing offerings is shown in front of her. Lotus petals forming the border connect the goddess with the plant emblem of fertility from which she springs.",
