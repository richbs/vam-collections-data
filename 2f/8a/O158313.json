They were hand-painted in watercolour and decorated with scraps of material and tinsel additions. They were popular during the first half of the 19th century and were considered an adult, rather than a child's hobby. By the 1830s it was possible to buy the tinsel, leather and feather ornaments to go each image.\n\nThis tinsel print shows John Thomas-Haines, a popular early 19th century writer-actor, in the role of Brian de Bois-Guilbert, in Ivanhoe.Bois-Guilbert was a Templar Knight; as a Norman in 12th Century England, he is characterised in the story as a deceitful and conniving villain.",
