The figure is dressed in a square-necked robe, belted at the waist, with a fur-lined velvet cloak hung over one shoulder and caught up to the belt under the right elbow. A child stands below, with short, curly hair. He confronts the female figure, head bent back, and arms raised above his head offering the bowl. He wears a short tunic, trimmed with fur and decorated with a broad border at the top and bottom and with a median band from nape to hem.",

A.21-1959, represent Winter and Autumn and appear to have formed part of a set of four personifications of the Seasons. They were presumably set in niches and their condition suggests that these were indoors.\nThe quality of the carving is high, and in view of the eclecticism of the style - the quasi-Gothic treatment of the head of Autumn is in marked contrast with the advanced classicism of the pose - it is likely that these figures originate not from a provincial centre but from a court workshop. Considering the widespread destruction of the buildings of Paris in the second half of the 19th century, it is possible that these figures may have decorated a hotel in the capital, now obliterated.",
