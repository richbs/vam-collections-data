This was pioneered in Pratapgarh in southern Rajasthan, but was also done at Ratlam and Indore in Madhya Pradesh. The ornaments were made of plaques of red, green or blue glass. Patterns in a delicate gold tracery--here showing birds and humans amid flowers--were fused onto the surface of the glass. The glass was held in gold and silver frames. The technique is still practised in Pratapgarh today. The brooch is not a traditional Indian ornament type and many thewa pieces like this one were probably made for export to Europe.",
