This included a marionette, or string puppet as Pulcinello or Punch, but by the 19th century  Punch was more usually a glove puppet, performed in a portable booth by one performer who  had a character on each hand.\n\nPunch became a popular character in Britain by the 19th century, when images of Punch and  Judy were used as decorative motifs on a range of household items. In 1841 the magazine  Punch, or the London Charivari was established, named after the comic and anarchic character  of Mr. Punch whose image appeared on its cover.",
