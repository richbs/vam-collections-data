The Empire Variety Theatre was the first joint venture of Horace Edward Moss (1852-1912) and Frank Thornton, and one of the earliest Moss Empires Variety Theatres, which at its peak comprised thirty-three theatres, the largest chain in the world.  Designed by Oliver and Leeson, it was built to a sumptuous standard, despite the location of the stage above the kitchen of an inn below, which frequently resulted in smells invading the auditorium.\n\nAt the opening ceremony for the Empire Theatre the previous December, its lessees Edward Moss and Frank Thornton had appeared on stage and declared they would cater for Newcastle audiences 'with first class matter, free from any objectionable features'. Of the sixteen acts on this bill, five were dancers, two were singers, seven were comedians, one was a bicycle act and another an act featuring 'the World's Worst Wizards',  late 19th-century precursors to the well-known 20th century comedy magician Tommy Cooper.",
