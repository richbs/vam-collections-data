London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, pp. 131-3, cat. no. 152.\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\nGIOVANNI da Udine (1487-1564) \t \nItalian School \nBorn at Udine, he was a pupil of Giorgione in Venice (1510-Il) before entering Raphael's studio in Rome. In 1517-19 he was entrusted by Raphael with the task of carrying out the decorative designs in the Vatican loggie. From 1520 he was in the service of Cardinal Giulio de' Medici, later Pope Clement VII, in Rome and Florence. After Clement's death in 1537 he settled in Udine. Strongly influenced by classical design, he ranks among the best decorative artists of his time. \n\nFollower of GIOVANNI da Udine \n\n152 \nFRAGMENTS OF WALL DECORATION \nFresco; irregular shapes \n36/6J-1886\n\n36.  Female head framed by a pattern of ribbons, 'Pompeian red' ground \n8 7/8 x 7/8 (22.5 x 22.5) \n36A. Female head framed by a pattern of ribbons, 'Pompeian red' ground: a later inscription lower left: GIO. DA VDINE \n8 \u00bc x 8 \u00bc (21 x 21) \n36B. Upper half of a decorative figure, within remnant of a rectangular frame \t\n9 \u00bd x 11 \u00be (24 x 30) \n36C. Fragment of a landscape, green monochrome \n10 x 15 (26.6 x 38) \n36D. Lower half of a decorative figure, within remnants of a rectangular frame \t\n10 \u00be x 11 \u00bd (28 x 29.2) \n36E. Part of a decorative frieze, grotesques and flower motifs, and part of an inscription <i>IMPA</i>; a later inscription top left: <i>III LOGGIA</i> \n8 \u00bc x 19 (21 x 48.2) \n36F, G, H. Small fragments of decorative schemes, \nF: 7 \u00bd x 7 (19 x 17.8)       G: 61 x 6 (17.2 x 15.2)      H : 6 3/8 x 4 (16 x 10) \n36I. A figure in the attitude of punting \t\n6 \u00be x 5 \u00be (17.2 x 14.6) \n36J. Small fragment of a head \t\n3 \u00be x 2 7/8 (9.5 x 7.5) \n\nThese fragments came to the Museum with the tradition that they were from the walls of the <i>Loggie</i> in the Vatican, hence that they were designed by Raphael and executed by Giovanni da Udine. However, though many of the decorative schemes and figure types are very similar, no identical features occur and there seems no reason to suppose that the Museum's fragments were ever part of the <i>Loggie</i>, which were completed by 1519 (0. Fischel, <i>Raphael</i>, tr. B. Rackham, i, 1948, p. 194; J. Pope-Hennessy, <i>Raphael</i>, 1970, p. 283, n. 8). They are in the style of Giovanni da Udine and presumably come from a scheme of grotesque decoration such as that represented by a drawing in the British Museum (1918-6-15-1; P. Pouncey and J. A. Gere, <i>Italian drawings in ... the British Museum: Raphael and his school</i>, 1962, no. 184). \nFor a discussion of the uses of these classical motifs in 16th century Rome, see N. Dacos, <i>La d\u00e9couverte de la Domus Aurea et la formation des grotesques \u00e0 la Renaissance</i>, 1969. \n\nProv. Bought 1885 from Mr W. M. Palin, Rome.\nO. Fischel, <u>Raphael</u>, tr. B.
