Print \u2013 etching,  screenprint, woodcut \u2013 is her primary medium but she is not a printmaker in the  conventional sense. In much of her work the printed element is the starting point for a three- dimensional work in which she plays variously with volume, space, surface and shadow.  Much of her work involves explorations of the idea of repetition \u2013 which is of course  fundamental to printmaking \u2013 but sometimes the repetition occurs within the confines of a  single piece (as in the Truncated Element  series, which employs versions of a repeating  pattern) or it mutates from one piece to the next; sometimes the repetition is inherent in the  form \u2013 for example wallpaper. Malmros often complicates the idea of the repeat by  cutting and folding areas of the print to negotiate between two and three  dimensions in a single work. In this wallpaper piece from the Truncated Element  series there is complex interplay between negative and positive (black / white,  printed areas / cut-out spaces) as well as subtle use of shadow and reflection.\n\n\tThis wallpaper is one of four works by Malmros selected for inclusion in Surface  Noise , a show of contemporary printmaking at Jerwood Space (19 January \u2013 27 February  2011), selected by V&A print curator Gill Saunders.",
