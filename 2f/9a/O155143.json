The theatre club was started in 1979 by the American director and writer Lou Stein in a room above the Prince Albert Pub in Pembridge Road.  Dedicated to producing the best works of foreign writers, by 1981 the Gate established itself as one of London's best fringe venues, along with the King's Head and the Bush. In 1982 the club expanded to include a brand-new custom-built studio theatre above the Latchmere Pub in Battersea.\n\nMayakovsky was a poet, playwright and political activist born in Georgia. He was a fully-fledged member of the Bolshevik party by 1911, and moved to Moscow as a student. He produced poems, slogans and posters for the Revolutionary government, and wrote an epic propaganda poem in 1921 about the evils of capitalism.  Towards the end of the 1920s he became increasingly disillusioned with Communism, and his satirical play The Bedbug was a result of his feelings about the state of the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin.",
