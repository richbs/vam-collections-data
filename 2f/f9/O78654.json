The shape is based on powder flasks of flattened cow horn widely used in the second half of the 16th century.  A measured quantity of powder was drawn off by using the spring-loaded pivoting cap on the nozzle.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe iron mounts are damascened (inlaid) in gold and silver and the wooden body is inlaid with panels of engraved staghorn.  The front scene shows a crowned figure in a chariot being drawn by other crowned figures in a grassy landscape with a walled city behind.  The scene represents the Triumph of Fame and is based on engravings by  the artist Virgil Solis (1514-1562) of Nuremberg, Germany.  The other inlaid ornament - hunting scenes, flowers, fruit and scrollwork - often appear on contemporary English furniture and firearms.\n\nOwnership & Use\nLike the pistol and gun that accompany this flask, it would have been an expensive object to buy.  Inlaid firearms and flasks reflected the owners' status and were kept as much for display as for use.",
