Not only was it a colourful accessory but small objects, such as a purse, papers or a dagger, could be kept in the folds.  This was particularly useful because there were no large pockets in the man's garments.\n\nMaterials and Making\nAlthough silk was widely used in urban workshops in Tunisia, it was not produced in North Africa and had to be imported in a raw state from other Mediterranean countries.  It was cleaned, carded and spun by local women, dyed by skilled craftsmen and then hand-woven by a man using a wooden loom.  The metal thread used to highlight details of the pattern was produced by men because tradition said that women's hands tarnish gold. There may be truth in this tradition because the oils on women's hands are known to be more acidic at certain times in their menstrual cycle.\n\nHistorical Associations\nThis sash was exhibited at the Great Exhibition of 1851 and was purchased by the Museum as an example of a tasteful and well-balanced design.",
