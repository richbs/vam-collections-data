The play had rarely been staged since the 17th century but Macklin's portrayal of Shylock as a cold and tragic character was a departure from the more usual interpretation as an almost comic character.\n\nMacklin researched his characterisation much more than was usual at the time, reading Josephus' History of the Jewsand making daily visits to The Exchange and the adjacent coffee houses to talk to the local Jewish community.  Through Shylock Macklin evolved from a modestly successful actor to a star of the London stage, and he continued to play the part for fifty years. He did, however, still wear the traditional highly stereotyped costume and make-up used to portray Jewish characters on stage.",
