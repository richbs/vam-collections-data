Though No. 192 [257-1888] is undated it was doubtless made during the same visit as the drawing No. 190 and that in the British Museum.\n\nNote on Nos. 191, 192, 200, 203, 204, 206, 220, 238, and 239 [297-1888, 257-1888, 622-1888, 251-1888, 351-1888, 271-1888, 353-1888, 609-1888, 799-1888]\n\nNos. 191 [297-1888], 192 [257-1888], 220 [353-1888], and 239 [799-1888] are untrimmed leaves from a sketch-book, of which the pages measure 6 3/8 x 9 \u00be ins. (161 x 237 mm.) and some bear the Whatman watermark of 1818.  The dimensions of Nos. 200 [622-1888], 203 [251-1888], 204 [351-1888], 206 [271-1888], and 238 [609-1888], all of which have been mounted on card and probably trimmed, show that they most certainly come from the same sketch-book.  The dated leaves show that Constable used this sketch-book in 1820 (Nos. 191 [297-1888], 203 [251-1888], and 206 [271-1888]) and in 1821 (Nos. 220 [353-1888] and 238 [609-1888]).",
