The other two parts were a large armchair at the head end and a stool in the middle. When the chaise-longue was assembled, this part was used as a foot-rest, but the three elements could also be used separately, this part serving as another, smaller armchair. The pieces were probably separated in the 19th century, when it would have been more profitable to sell them as three different objects.\n\nThe original covers were probably silk. When this piece came to the Museum it had covers of red Morocco leather, which may have been used to lend it the appearance of a library chair. The present leather covers, put on in the 1970s, seem to have been based on the previous upholstery.",
