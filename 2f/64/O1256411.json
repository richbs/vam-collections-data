The rest of the book comprises mathematics theory and exercises, mostly geometry. Each title is written in block capitals which are filled with \n\nThe first page is ebulliently entitled 'Mesuration of Superficies' (sic), in a gothic style, with an introduction to the topic. Then follows a number of 'Problems', each with an illuminated title and a number of examples, both abstract and practical.\nProblem I - to find the area of a parallelogram\nProblem II - to find the area of a triangle\nProblem III - to find the side of a right angle triangle having the other two sides given\nProblem IV - to find the area of a trapeziod\nProblem V - to find the area of a trapezium\nProblem VI - to find the area of an irregular polygon\nProblem VII - to find the area of a regular polygon\nProblem VIII - to find the diameter and circumference of a circle\nProblem IX - to find the length of any arc of a circle\nProblem X - to find the area of a circle\nProblem XI - to find the area of the sector of a circle\nProblem XII - to find the area of a segment of a circle\nProblem XIII - to find the area of a circular ring\nProblem XIV - to measure long irregular figure\n\nThe second section of the book is entitled 'Mensuration of Solids'.

Francis, who grew up to be a tailor in Derby, was learning the essential skills of calculating distance, area and volume.",
