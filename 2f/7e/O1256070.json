The set gave hours of pleasure at bedtime, listening to the Light programme from the nearby Droitwich transmitters and also to the Home Service. I would fall asleep with the ex-army headphones still on my head and my mother would come in to my room and take them off. I used the crystal set right up to leaving home for university in 1965'.",
