His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nOliver Messel won an Antoinette Perry 'Tony' Award for his set for Rashomon, a play directed by Peter Glenville and performed at the Music Box, New York in 1959.  Although a box office failure, the play was critically acclaimed.  Brooks Atkinson praised Messel\u2019s atmospheric set  \u2018\u2026Oliver Messel\u2019s settings, representing the decaying Rashomon gate and a barbaric bamboo jungle are like the illustrations for a macabre legend.
