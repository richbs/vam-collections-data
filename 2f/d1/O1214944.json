The geese must try to trap the fox before they are captured and the fox must try to capture as many geese as possible to stop being trapped first. Fox and Geese was the favourite pastime of Queen Victoria.\n\nThis game was manufactured by The Green Board Game Company in 1995, who were a manufacturer and distributor of educational board games. The strategy game and the race game are the two main types of board game and can be seen in a variety of forms including educational, like this one, and moral. Strategy games are usually played by two people and require at least some degree of skill. These can be subdivided into several different categories: war games that involve capturing, such as Chess and Draughts; hunting or chasing games, such as Fox and Geese and Chinese Chequers; and alignment games, such as Nine Men's Morris and Connect-4.",
