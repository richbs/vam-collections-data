He was a prolific landscape painter and lithographer and exhibited regularly in the Salon in Paris from 1831. He travelled in England, the Netherlands, France and Italy. He borrowed from wide-ranging sources and mainly produced landscapes, history paintings and a famous Album de diableries.\n\nThis painting is a fine example of Lepoittevin's seascapes executed during the 1830s probably after he travelled to the Netherlands. The composition relies in fact on earlier Dutch examples such as the paintings of Jan van Goyen (1596-1656). These earlier models were newly explored in the first half of the 19th century as they display a direct observation of the natural world in which the Romantics were interested in their opposition to academic art.",

Front' (?) as 'An Oil on canvas. Rocky Coast-near Havre? By E. Poittevin. In Frame. Signed with Initials, French. Present Cent.y. H. 10 \u00be in., W. 1 ft. 2 in.'; Bequeathed by Rev. Chauncey Hare Townshend, 1868.\nBequeathed by Rev. Chauncey Hare Townshend, 1868.\n\nHistorical significance: This painting is a fine example of Lepoittevin's seaviews. It depicts a rocky coast near Le Havre at sunset. The spacious, horizontal format and pictorial rendering of a diffuse sunset light is reminiscent of Dutch landscape paintings of the 17th century. Lepoittevin was particularly influenced by Dutch paintings in the 1830s, especially after he travelled to the Netherlands. \nThe compositional formula is dominated by three pinnacles in the middle distance, bathed in the shade, set against the waning sunset light. These elements provide the picture with a sense of mystery, typical of the Romantic imagery.   \nComparable subjects by Lepoittevin include <i>Fisherman waving at a boat from the shore, Port-en-Bessin</i>, dated 1832, and <i> A Family on the seashore</i>, dated 1846, both in the Mus\u00e9e maritime de l'Ile Tatihou, Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue.\nLepoittevin is often compared with the Romantic painter Eug\u00e8ne Isabey (1803-1886) whose oeuvre includes similar compositions such as <i>Boat at Moon Light</i>, Mus\u00e9e National Magnin, Dijon.\nThis painting was hung in the Fossil and Mineral Room in the Rev Townshend's house in London.",

            "historical_context_note": "19th-century French art is marked by a succession of movements based on a more or less close relationship with nature. At the beginning of the century, Romantic artists were fascinated by nature they interpreted as a mirror of the mind. They investigated human nature and personality, the folk culture, the national and ethnic origins, the medieval era, the exotic, the remote, the mysterious and the occult. This movement was heralded in France by such painter as Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix (1798-1863). In its opposition to academic art and its demand for a modern style Realism continued the aims of the Romantics. They assumed that reality could be perceived without distortion or idealization, and sought after a mean to combine the perception of the individual with objectivity. This reaction in French painting against the Grand Manner is well represented by Gustave Courbet (1819-1877) who wrote a 'Manifesto of Realism', entitled <i>Le R\u00e9alisme</i> published in Paris in 1855. These ideas were challenged by the group of the Barbizon painters, who formed a recognizable school from the early 1830s to the 1870s and developed a free, broad and rough technique. They were mainly concerned by landscape painting and the rendering of light. The works of Narcisse Virgile Diaz de la Pe\u00f1a (1807-1876), Jules Dupr\u00e9 (1811-1889), Th\u00e9odore Rousseau (1812-1867), Constant Troyon (1810-1865) and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet (1814-1875) anticipate somehow  the <i>plein-air</i> landscapes of the Impressionists.",
