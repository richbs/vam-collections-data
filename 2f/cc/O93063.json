            "history_note": "The altarpiece was  purchased in Florence for \u00a3450 in 1859 at the same time as the Ferrucci altarpiece.  Both were said to have  been in the church of San Girolamo in Fiesole outside Florence. The Order of San Girolamo was suppressed in 1668 and  the church and many of its contents passed into the hands of the Bardi family. In 1798 it passed to the Ricasoli family, was restored, and the sculptures were later purchased from a sculptor's studio in Florence.\n\nHistorical significance: This is not a securely documented work by Andrea Ferrucci, and some scholars have questioned its attribution. Riccardo Naldi did not include the tabernacle in his monograph on Andrea Ferrucci, and commented that some confusion has arisen from this attribution (Naldi, p.24 footnote 41). However, he does not provide an alternative attribution, nor do all of the works which he cites as the work of Andrea appear to come from the same hand. \n\nThe attribution in part comes from the fact that in 1859 it was purchased with the Altarpiece (V&A 6724-1859) executed by Ferrucci and with both items securely documented as  having come from the church of San Girolamo in Fiesole.  Though Giorgio Vasari did not mention the tabernacle when he described the Ferrucci altarpiece, both the altarpiece and a tabernacle were described by Bandini in 1776 in a letter describing the churches of Fiesole.  He attributed the tabernacle to Ferrucci and though he saw it in the sacristy, suggested it may have been on the high altar at one point. (Bandini, p. 87).  Stylistic similarities between the tabernacle and the altarpiece suggest they were both executed by Ferrucci.",

            "historical_context_note": "Tabernacles are used to hold the consecrated host or relics.  The terms \u201cciborium\u201d and \u201ctabernacle\u201d are sometimes used interchangeably, though strictly speaking the tabernacle holds the pyx which contains the consecrated host, while the ciborium is shaped liked a cup and directly holds the consecrated host. The pyx is an even smaller vessel designed to hold the wafer, and can be placed inside the tabernacle. During the early Christian period and the Middle Ages, there were no firm regulations on where the consecrated host was to be kept as long as it was secure. Two synods \u2013 at Cologne (1281) and M\u00fcnster (1279) \u2013 determined that the sacrament must be locked in a receptacle above the altar, but did not specify the type of container or a more specific location.  The sacrament was therefore preserved in pyxes, ciboria or tabernacles which could be in a cupboard in the sacristy, on the high altar, or on a nearby altar.  It could also be housed in small containers in the form of doves or chalices which were suspended over the altar.  This practice was especially popular in England and France from the tenth century until its prohibition in 1863, when the Catholic church determined that the host should be kept in tabernacles either on or near the high altar.  Tabernacles could be either freestanding or incorporated into the wall above the altar.  \n\nOne of the most famous wall tabernacles in Florence was Desiderio da Settignano\u2019s tabernacle in San Lorenzo (1461). Elements of this, such as the blessing Christ Child at the top, the kneeling angels, the shield-bearing putti and the fictive architecture surrounding the tabernacle door soon provided  models for sculpted altarpieces and wall tabernacles throughout Tuscany, especially among Desiderio\u2019s immediate followers. The tabernacle demonstrates Andrea Ferrucci\u2019s familiarity with the works of Desiderio da Settignano especially in  the figure of the blessing Christ Child at the top, which is based on Desiderio\u2019s figure.\n\nFerrucci was initially trained by his cousin Francesco di Simone Ferrucci and therefore would have absorbed Desiderio\u2019s influence through Francesco, who may also have assisted Andrea del Verrocchio. According to Vasari, Andrea Ferrucci was then trained by Michele Maiani da Fiesole (who had worked in Rome) and went on to work  in Imola, Naples, Rome, Pistoia, Fiesole and Florence.  By 1508 he was documented in Florence, though it is known that he travelled to Naples during that year. In 1512 he was elected the capomaestro (head of building works) for the Florence cathedral, a position he held until he died in 1526.\n\nVasari praised his work though claimed Andrea accomplished it without the benefit of knowing \u201cthe principles of disegno\u201d \u2013 a term that for Vasari meant both drawing and design.  He also noted that Andrea began his career by carving leaves and foliage, which gave him a \u201cresolute and quick hand.\u201d  \n\nThe Rucellai arms (per bend, in chief a lion passant, in base, barry indented) on the tabernacle give at least the family name of the patron. Since the tomb slab of Girolamo di Piero di Cardinale Rucellai was described  as near an altar on the left of the church of San Girolamo in Fiesole, it has been assumed that he commissioned the Ferrucci tabernacle, though there is no documentary proof of this (Pope-Hennessy,182). Rucellai is also thought to have commissioned a painting by Francesco Botticini depicting St Jerome, Pope Damasus, Sts Paula and Eustochium (now at the National Gallery in London, see Davies, pp.118-120). F. W. Kent remarked that Girolamo di Piero di Cardinale de\u2019 Rucellai\u2019s burial in the church of San Girolamo in Fiesole was a departure from the typical sites of burial for Rucellai men \u2013 most chose to be buried in the ancestral tombs at either Santa Maria Novella or San Pancrazio in Florence (Kent, 262). Kent also noted that Rucellai\u2019s departure from the norm should not be seen as a rejection of his family \u2013 certainly the inscription of his family name, and, if he was the one to have commissioned Ferrucci, the large coat of arms on the tabernacle publicize his Rucellai heritage and possibly his (rather distant) connection with the Medici family by having the Medici emblem of feathers within a diamond ring incorporated into the pilasters of the painting. However, Cardini noted that both the Rucellai and the Salimbeni family used the symbol of the diamond ring, as did the Sforza and the Este and it was not therefore \u201cexclusive to the Medici.\u201d  The Rucellai also used the feather device (Cardini, 73). \n\nThe large bird holding the Rucellai coats of arms at the bottom of the tabernacle might be either an eagle or a falcon. Cardini mentioned that  falcons were not often used in heraldry while at the same time noting  the Medici inventory of 1492 recorded a standard with an falcon on it (Cardini, 67, 70).  The curve of the head, and the shape of the beak of this bird is similar to those of the birds described as  falcons  found on the lavabo in the church of San  Lorenzo in Florence and on the rear of the tabernacle in San Miniato a Monte, both commissioned by Piero the Gouty, who used as one of his emblems  the falcon holding a diamond ring with a ribbon inscribed SEMPER. (For images see Cardini, 70). Though the meaning of the falcon is still unclear, one scholar has seen it as Piero\u2019s citation of an Egyptian symbol of divinity as per descriptions in Horapollo\u2019s fifth- century Hyeroglyphica (Cardini, 67 citing Parronchi)  Such an interpretation would be appropriate for a tabernacle, which according to Christian belief housed the divine body of Christ. \n\nEagles were commonly used as heraldic devices. Since the bird is gripping the Rucellai shield in his talons, it may have been intended to represent an eagle. An engraving in Alciato\u2019s Diverse Imprese of 1551 showed an eagle with open wings alighting with open wings on top of the tomb of Aristomenes, the legendary King of Messina who resisted the Spartans for eleven years, and thus an eagle was seen as an appropriate emblem to decorate  the tomb of strong men.  The tabernacle has long been associated with the tomb of Girolamo di Piero di Cardinale Rucellai, and the choice of an eagle to bear the arms of the Rucellai could suggest that the tabernacle was placed near the tomb.\n\nThe inscription on the tabernacle, \u201chic est panis vivus qui de cello descendit\u201d (this the living bread that descends from Heaven) seems to be a combination of John 6:50 \u201cHic est panis de caelo descendens ut si quis ex ipso manducaverit non moriatur\u201d (\u201cThis is the bread which comes down from heaven: that if any man eat of it, he may not die\u201d and John 6:51 \u201cEgo sum panis vivus qui de caelo descendi\u201d (\u201cI am the living bread which came down from heaven\u201d). Both inscriptions were common features of Renaissance wall tabernacles.",
