The torches are carried by many people throughout numerous countries during the transfer of the flame. The bearers are usually amateur athletes who are allowed to keep the torches as a souvenir. This torch was made for the 1948 London Olympic relay, and is thought to have been used on the Belgium leg of the journey between Olympia and London.\n \nThe British Olympic Committee wanted the torch to be 'a good example of British craftsmanship' and chose architect Ralph Lavers to design the holder. Lavers was interested in classical architecture and archaeology, and his design for the torch was successful enough to be used again for the 1956 Melbourne Olympics.\n\nThe torches had to be lightweight because each runner would have to run about one kilometre with it. Each torch weighed just less than a kilogram, and was made in lightweight aluminium. The fuel was supplied in tablet forms, and inserted into the steel burner perforated with holes to protect the flame from strong winds. Each torch had to burn for at least 15 minutes.\n\nThe 1948 London games were the first to follow the Second World War. Much of London was still in ruins, and rationing was still in place. Known as \u2018the austere games\u2019, the Olympics that year were a low key affair. Athletes brought their own sandwiches to eat and the British team were instructed to make their own uniforms.",
