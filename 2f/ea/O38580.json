She obviously cherished these clothes as a reminder...\n\nWorn by the children of Charles Powell (a British tea merchant) and his wife Florence (n\u00e9e Doggett), who lived in Amoy, Fukien province, S China: Florence Gwendoline (Gwen) (b 1875), Norah Jane (b 1876), Dorothy Maud (\"Bobs\") (b about 1878) and Charles (\"Laddie\") ( b about 1880) , although as the children grew older they were sent to England to school.  On a visit to England with their amah, Ahlan, they were all photographed together in Chinese costume, and in fact the Powell children seem to have worn native dress much of the time at home.",
