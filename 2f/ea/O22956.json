This was one of the earliest examples, an abstract image derived from photographs of the moon's surface, and clearly related to the fantasy imagery of contemporary psychedelic graphics. By 1969, the year of the first manned landing on the moon, it was possible to buy a variety of fabrics and wallpaper patterned with rockets and other lunar imagery printed in vivid 'Pop Art' colours.'",
