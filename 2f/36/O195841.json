ISBN 0714126411.\nThe following is the full text of the entry\n\n\"63 \n\nAlbum formerly owned by Alexander Constantine Ionides \nPaintings, drawings, prints and photographs mounted on pages, 23.5 x 18 cm (9\u00bc \u00d7 7? in)\n\nPage 2 recto (ten wood engravings: eight illustrations to 'Thornton's Virgil' by William Blake, <i>The Baccante</i> by Welby Sherman after Edward Calvert and Peace attributed to Samuel Palmer) illustrated \n\nLit: Evans 2002 \nLondon, Victoria and Albert Museum \nThis album contains drawings, prints and photographs of works of art collected by the Greek Maecenas Alexander Constantine Ionides and members of his family. Its main interest in this context is the presence in it of a number of wood engravings by Blake, Calvert and other artists connected with the Ancients, including possibly Palmer. In his article on the album Evans draws attention to Ionides's relationship with Calvert, which seems to have been particularly close in 1826-7 when Ionides was a pupil at the school in Brixton run by Calvert's old friend Joseph Hine. Calvert himself was living in Brixton at that time and may even have offered drawing lessons at Hine's school. \n\nThe contact between Calvert and Ionides occurred at a time when Calvert was at the height of his creative powers as a wood engraver and the album contains impressions of both some of his finest work and the wood engravings by Blake for Thornton's Pastorals of  Virgil (see cat. 19) that inspired him and other Ancients. Most intriguing of all is the presence of a number of crudely cut wood engravings that combine pastoral motifs, similar to those in the 'blacks' that Palmer was then painting (see cats 30, 31), with the erotic themes to be found in Calvert's engravings. There are no other records of these extraordinary images. Their position in the album confirms both that they were highly prized by Ionides and that they are related (as their appearance would suggest) to Calvert and his circle. \nIn his article Evans speculates that these wood engravings might be by Palmer. There are certainly strong arguments in support of this claim. Palmer is known to have been interested in wood engraving at this time, collaborating with Sherman on one block (see cat. 62). The roughness of the cutting could be explained by Palmer's inexperience in the practice of wood engraving. Palmer is not known to have produced other sexually explicit scenes, yet letters by him from the period certainly reveal a strong erotic obsession. Since so much of his early work was destroyed by his son, it is quite possible that risqu\u00e9 pictures might have been undertaken and not have survived. \nAnother possibility is that the wood blocks may have been engraved by Ionides himself. A drawing of a classical figure by Ionides occurs in the album, and while this is of a totally different nature to these wood engravings, it does at least confirm that he had artistic aspirations at this time. Evans himself dismisses the notion that Ionides could have made the engravings. His main argument is that, if Ionides had produced such works, they would have been more likely to reflect the work of Calvert than of Palmer. Yet the figures do have affinities with Calvert's, and Ionides would surely have had access to Palmer's images if he was close to Calvert at this time. On the other hand, it might be argued that the wood engravings, while crude, show a boldness of conception unlikely to be found in an inexperienced amateur. \nAnother intriguing possibility, raised by Elizabeth E. Barker in an essay in this volume (p. 48), is that these designs could have been made by Calvert in c.1824-6, prior to the time when he had fully mastered the engraving process. \nThe identity of the cutter of these wood engravings must remain unclear at this point. What is certain is that the artist was intimately acquainted with the work of Blake and the Ancients. \nIt is hoped that the present book and exhibition will assist in determining whether they are in fact by Palmer.\"\nEvans, Mark, 'Blake, Calvert - and Palmer?

Ionides \n\n18th or early 19th century album, 54 fols., 235 x 180 mm.  \n\nCase binding of half maroon leather with paper sides, blind roll tooled across corners and down board edge at joint, three line gold tooling across spine to make five panels into which a centre decoration of lyres has been tooled in gold. The album is double-sided, to accommodate prints from one end and drawings from the other (stamped PRINTS and DRAWINGS in gold on the spine).\n\nThe book block comprises eight gatherings of various coloured papers (ivory, grey, pink, brown, green, buff, blue). Originally each gathering appears to have been made up of three sheets of folio quired with added compensation guards.  Some leaves have been cut out and in other instances prints or drawings have been tipped to the compensation guards.  The book block has been sewn all along on two parchment tapes and its first and last leaves have been adhered to the case as the pastedown.\n\nMany of the prints in the album have been trimmed. Unless stated as plate sizes, paper sizes are given. \n\nFollowing its acquisition, the album was foliated continuously from the start of the PRINTS section on fol. 1r to the start of the DESIGNS section on fol.54v. As a result, the folio sequence appears to run in reverse when approached from the start of the DESIGNS section on fol. 54v. The contents of the album have also been individually inventoried, from E.1349:1-2001 to E.1349:94-2001.\n\nIn the following list, numbers prefixed by the letters 'F', 'L' and 'B' refer, respectively, to the catalogue numbers in A.J. FINBERG, 'Edward Calvert's Engravings', The Print Collector's Quarterly, 17 [1930], pp.139-53, R. LISTER, Edward Calvert, London [1962] and D.
