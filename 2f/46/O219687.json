Designs [39] for a collection of\nwallpapers and furnishings textiles, commissioned\nand produced by Harlequin Wall Coverings Ltd.,\nSileby, Leicestershire. 1989-90                           E.389-412-1994\n\nNeisha Crosland trained at the Royal College of Art\nas a textile designer. This coordinated range for\nHarlequin was sold through Texas Home Care outlets\nas part of their policy to stock more up-market\ndesigns. The inspiration for much of the Harlequins\nrange came from the set of designs and costumes for\nthe Russian Ballet. The designs were built up in\nvarious stages from  rough sketches, using\nphotocopies to work out the repeat. The final\nstage was a finished painting in gouache ready for\nphotography. From these photographs were made the\nseparations to prepare for screen printing on the\ntextile or wallpaper.\n\nSee CROSLAND, Neisha in the Wallpaper Catalogue for the\npattern book, E.413-1994.\n... \n           Rye.
