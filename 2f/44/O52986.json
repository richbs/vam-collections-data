            "public_access_description": "This cabinet is brightly painted in the Gothic Revival style. At the time that it was made, some furniture designers were inspired by medieval painted furniture. They saw this mostly in cathedrals and churches. The Gothic (or pointed) arches, the painted geometric ornament and the mythical creatures are typical of the Gothic Revival style. On the other hand, the real creatures, such as the squirrel and bird, are in the Anglo-Japanese style. These are framed in asymmetric reserves. Different influences are often mingled together in British 19th-century furniture, which creates an overall appearance that is unmistakably Victorian. We do not know who made or owned this cabinet.",
