Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. Above all they had to have the means of attaching to a cord. Netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated is the katabori (shape carving), a three-dimensional carving, such as this one in the form of a squatting figure.\n\nFrom the 18th century onwards, netsuke were increasingly signed by the craftsman. This example is signed by Tanaka Minko (1735-1816), who was the founder of a small group of regional netsuke carvers in Tsu, Ise province.",
