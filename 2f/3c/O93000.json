The wodewose appeared in romance literature, religious stories and saints' lives. He was associated with desire and lust, physical agression and insanity. However he later also came to symbolise freedom and the the unsinful innocent life. The wildman also became increasingly associated with traditional courtly pastimes from courtly love to chivalry. On this object the wodewose acts as an armorial support. Wildmen are often seen in this heraldic context bearing coats of arms. A covered silver beaker in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, (Cloisters collection 50.7.1a,b) shows a wildman holding a shield in a very similar position to the V&A and Cleveland chandelier figures. In this context, the wildman appears to be a humourous and subversive figure, playfully parodying chivalric and courtly culture. At the same time, he was used to promote heraldic language and the identity of the person whose arms he once bore.",

The chandelier stem would have passed through the hole in the figure's body. A similar example in the Cleveland Museum of Art (65.21) suggests that the wildman was once holding a club in his right hand. His kneeling position and the placing of his left hand may also indicate that he once rested a heraldic shield against his knee.\n\nMany surviving chandelier figures represent a Christian theme. Chandeliers featuring the Virgin Mary or the saints were often hung inside a church. This is a secular figure however, which may suggest that the chandelier was used in the home. As such, the figure would be a rare example from a secular ornamental light of the medieval period.",
