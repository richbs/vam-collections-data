It is formed by simply folding a single sheet of seven-layer plywood in two directions from the seat to create a back rest and side panels that act as legs. One critic described it as 'wood origami', a reference to the Japanese art of folding paper. The basic conical shape makes it easy to stack and groups of chairs can be joined with a clip at the base to form straight or curved rows.\n\nThe technique of moulding plywood was perhaps the greatest contribution to furniture design made by Scandinavian designers and manufacturers in the 20th century. Here the Swedish designer Peter Karpf has used it to create a simple, economical and elegant stacking chair.",
