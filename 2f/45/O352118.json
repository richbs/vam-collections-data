Half-length figure of Christ with his right hand raised in blessing and his left hand holding an orb with a crucifix. The crucifix and orb are embroidered in laid and couched metal thread. Christ is wearing a cloak fastened at the neck, worked in metal thread and silk, with an oval shaped ornament and below wears a robe in the same colours as the cloak in red, pink, blue and brown with outlines of folds of drapery in black. His robes are embroidered in silk with the edges in couched metal thread. The outline of the figure was entirely worked in black silk.\n\nTongues of flame appear at the sides and above the head of Christ. The ground surrounding the figure is worked in silver thread couched down with silk and with a curved sprig of flowers on each side of the figure. The flowers, which may be pansies or violas, are worked in a style similar to that found on caskets/slips and other 17th century English secular embroidery.\n\nThe burse is edged at the front and back with metallic braid, with some of the metal wound on a core and the rest as flat metal strips. At the four corners are applied four 'leafed' stylised flowers in blue silk and metal thread.\n\nThe back is made from a woven silk in blue and a yellowish cream. The back and front are lined with yellow silk and stiffened between the layers, possibly with paper or card. The side pieces are made of greenish-blue silk, which is shattering at the top edges.",
