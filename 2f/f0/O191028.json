The Independent Women's Union unified various initiatives formed to promote women's issues during the 1989 revolution: \"a manifesto for an autonomous women's movement\" was issued on 3 December 1989, and although the founding congress was not held until 17 February 1990, the UVF had meanwhile sent a total of 20 representatives to the Round Table and its leader, Tatjana Bohn, had on 28 January 1990 entered Modrow's reconstituted government as one of the eight opposition ministers without portfolio. It had also made an electoral pact with the Green Party (see note to E.2135-1990). Other posters relating to the Independent Women's Union are E.2085-6-1990 and E.2096-7-1990.",
