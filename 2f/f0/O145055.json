            "public_access_description": "This bill of sale is signed by the actor -managers Colley Cibber (1671-1757), Robert Wilks (1665-1732) and Barton Booth (1681-1733), known as 'the triumvirate' that was running the Theatre Royal Drury Lane in January 1714. The actor Thomas Doggett (1670-1721), a former partner, had retired in disgust when his enemy Booth was allowed a share in the theatre.\n\nThe is a bill for fabric which would probably have been used for costumes at Drury Lane Theatre, and would have been kept as part of the theatre's accounts. An advertisement in The Spectator, 21 March 1711, noted that the Mercer's shop at the Blackamore's Head in Bedford Street, Covent Garden, was then run by Carew Reynell with his partners Tristram Huddleston, Isaac Spiltimber and Samuel Wrexham: 'the said Tristram Huddleston and Samuel Wrexham being removed from the Wheatsheaf in Bedford Street to the Blackamore's Head ... where there is the greatest variety of new silks of all kinds and from the highest to lowest prices.'",
