The \"Rising Hinge with Steel roler\" on plate 37, may well be the beginning of self-closing floor hinges.   A set of fittings cost 15<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>., but a smaller size is priced at 11<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>.   Some of the joint drawings disclose details of construction of considerable mechanical ingenuity.   The door springs made in iron as well as brass, cost from 4<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>.   The principle underlying the design was a coiled spring, probably of flat steel.   The chair nails were supplied in \" princes \" metal and \" gold colour.\"   Screws constitute an interesting page ; the countersunk pattern was made in the following sizes and numbers :\u2014\u00bd in. by 1 to 7 in., \u215d in . by 3 to 9 in., \u00bein. by 4 to 10 in., I in. by 6 to 12 in., 1\u00bc in. by 7 to 13 in., 1\u00bd in. by 8 to 14 in., 1\u00bein. by 9 to 15 in., 2 in. by 10 to 16 in.   They are quoted at per gross, and are described as \" iron screws with brass plated heads.\"   There is a line against each run of sizes, not priced ; another grade, \"Tinn'd Lacq<sup>d</sup>.\" Round head screws of iron with similar heads were supplied from 2 to 10 inches long.   The drawings, which are full size, show a flat mushroom head, with a corresponding shallow neck.   A trencher is a plate castor, in this case of iron with brass frames and wheels.   \"Tulip\" castors represent an attempt to apply the acanthus leaf to the socket.   The bell furniture section numbers 47 pages, and is very comprehensive.   This section discloses the use of a metal link chain as early as the date indicated.   The lock knobs were fastened to the spindle by being riveted through the centre of the grip.   The rappers are described as \"hatch knockers,\" and the crude bolt and nut method of attaching to the door front, explains in part the popularity of knocker-wrenching with the \"Bucks\" of the Regency and later times.   The inclusion of two pages of circular \" hit and miss\" ventilators is significant of a growing interest in hygiene.   The largest is 5 in. in diameter.   Prices throughout are written in with ink.\"\n\n",
