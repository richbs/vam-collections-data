            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nThis is an etched caricature - a type of print which pokes fun at the folly or foibles of an individual or society.  It is printed by means of etching. In etching, the design is marked out by drawing with an etching needle into a thin waxy layer - known as 'the ground' - coating a metal printing plate. The channels drawn into the wax expose the metal beneath. The waxed plate is then dipped in acid, which eats into the metal not protected by 'the ground', and so creates the grooves that hold the ink from which the image is to be printed. Subsequent to that process, this print was coloured in by hand with watercolour paint, ready to catch the public's eye when displayed in a printseller's window.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe caricature satirises exhibition-goers, dressed in the fashion of 1829, in a room at the Royal Academy, London. The walls are packed from skirting board to ceiling with an interlocking arrangement of pictures. In the foreground, a man in dandified dress gestures at one of the pictures, seeking a response from the bluff country gentleman dressed like John Bull (the personification of unsophisticated rural Englishness).  This man is unable to express his response to art in any meaningful way - 'Why, I like it; but it wants a kind of - you understand - you see it's a - see there, it wants - the colouring is - a - you see - that is ...'. The caricature ridicules both his painful ignorance and the ludicrous pretentiousness of the surroundings he has found himself in.\n\nTime\nDuring the late 18th and early 19th centuries, caricature became a social institution, an art form in its own right, and a major vehicle for  political and social comment.  Its aim was to ridicule and castigate by means of a humorous distortion of the truth. Thanks to the talents of masters of satire such as James Gillray (1756-1815) and Thomas Rowlandson (1756-1827), caricatures became the bestsellers of the day.",
