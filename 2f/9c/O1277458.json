Signed by the artist, with the initials, A.C, mid to late 19th century.\n\nW.G. Ross started his career as a compositor on one of the Glasgow newspapers, singing occasionally at local harmonic assemblies. He moved to London where he became a success at the Cider Cellars, Maiden Lane, with songs such as \u2018The Lively Flea,\u2019 \u2018Jack Rag,\u2019 and \u2018Going Home with the Milk in the Morning\u2019, before achieving major success with 'The Ballad of Sam Hall'. \n\nThe popularity of this song was such that Ross became one of the earliest stars of the nascent music hall, drawing huge crowds to the Cider Cellars to see him sing. Ross performed the song dressed in tattered clothes and a bedraggled hat, with a clay pipe clenched between his teeth, taking on the character of an unrepentant chimney sweep, sentenced to hanging for murder, on his last journey from Newgate to Tyburn gallows. The song was a version of the folk ballad 'Jack Hall' about a criminal, sold as a child to be a chimney sweep, who became a highwayman and was executed at Tyburn in December 1707.\n\nWith its lugubrious refrain: \u2018damn his eyes\u2019 Ross's song held a morbid fascination for his audiences and the journalist F.C. Burnand (1836-1917) remembered visiting as a boy and seeing men in adjoining rooms rushing to the concert hall to hear Ross sing 'Sam Hall'  when his turn was announced, even if they had heard him do it fifty times before. Similarly, writing in 1858, J. Ewing Ritchie recalled that when 'Sam Hall' was sung: \u2018horrible as the song was \u2013 revolting to all but blas\u00e9 men, the room was crammed to suffocation \u2013 it was impossible often to get a seat, and you might have heard a pin drop.\u2019 \n\nFor a decade Ross continued to draw crowds, but he never repeated the success of 'Sam Hall' and his later years were spent as part of an unsuccessful theatre company in the provinces.",
