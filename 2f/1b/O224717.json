These etchings were made as part of a series of unpublished amateur etchings produced by Henry Cole between 1860 and 1866 and were presented to the Queen's Library, Windsor, the Art Library of the South Kensington Museum and the British Museum as two separate sets in 1874. The print at the top of the sheet shows Netley Park towards Ewhurst (1861), the middle print shows Shere: Cottage of Henry Cole and Fir Hill [Surrey] (1860) and the print at the bottom of the sheet shows Shere Church and Newlands Corner [Surrey] (1861). The middle etching is part of Series A - ten etchings on half imperial and the top and bottom etchings are part of Series B - twenty-eight etchings on Quarto Imperial. \n\nIn 1856 Henry Cole decided to find a country cottage near enough to London for him to commute to work. He was taken to see Elm Cottage in Shere which he eventually agreed to rent for the next five years at \u00a330 a year. Cole described the village as containing 'under 1,500 inhabitants, many of whom live among the sand-hills at a distance from the little place, which, although within 30 miles of the metropolis, yield even blackcock to the sportsman, and once on a time gave cover to the Sussex smuggler, before the dawn of free trade. It has a church with architecture beginning with the Normans (I am not sure that a Saxon bit or two might not be found left in the tower), besides offering specimens of all the broad divisions of English architecture down to the days of modern church-wardenism.' Henry Cole and his family spent many summers here in the cottage and Cole travelled up to town on most days by train. It was here that Cole learned the craft of etching in 1860 from the printmaker Seymour Haden, an accomplished practitioner. On 28 July Henry Cole tried to etch a view of the cottage but made a mess of the perspective. On 8 August Haden revised the etching and printed proofs. The sheet that we have been given has an inscription on it in pencil 'Shere on both sides of the Tillingbourn. Vale of Albury - H. Cole exhibited at the Royal Academy 1865' and below it 'To the Rt Hon H. H. Bruce, MP.'  \n\nFrom: Bonython, Elizabeth and Anthony Burton.  The Great Exhibitor - The Life and Work of Henry Cole.
