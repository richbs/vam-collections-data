Hamilton's up-dating of his famous statement on contemporary society, using computer-aided \"collaging\", arose through his constant investigation into new technology for image making.  \"Just what is it...\" has sometimes been appropriated and 'adjusted' by other artists with absolutely no permission sought from Hamilton.  Q.E.D. could therefore be read as the artist's understandable desire to have the 'last' word himself on such 'reinterpretation'.  The image was made using a variety of computer technologies and a Quantel Paint box and its production was filmed in the BBC programme Q.E.D. shown 21.4.1993.  An image of the original Just what is it... hangs discreetly on the far right wall.",
