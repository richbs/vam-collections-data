He has a wooden leg from the left knee joint.\n\nHe wears a blue and white striped cotton shirt (possibly old), and black serge trousers, (probably recycled since there are old seams visible), the waistband is finished with a hand-sewn strip of brown cotton to thread the draw-string. \n\nThree control bars, the third to work the bowing motion of the right hand. There are staples in the side of the neck for the run-through, again for the bowing movement.\n\nCarved yoke and pelvis.  Flexible waist.",

Marionette shows were a popular form of entertainment for adults in the 19th century, many of them family concerns which travelled around the country long before the advent of film and television, presenting shortened versions of London's latest popular entertainment from melodramas and pantomimes to minstrel shows and music hall. In the 18th and early 19th centuries their theatres were relatively makeshift, but after about 1860 many became quite elaborate, with walls constructed from wooden shutters, seating made from tiered planks of wood, and canvas roofs.\n\nThe figures were carved, painted, dressed and performed by members of the company.  This is Tommy One-Leg, a one-eyed, one-legged sailor fiddler who was specially made for the popular comic music hall song 'How Cruel Were My Parients' (sic). It was sung by his wife, relating the fate of her husband who lost his eye and leg when he was press-ganged into the navy, and how he was reduced to busking in the streets with her.",

They began working on recreating some of the puppets' original repertoire. Since the original cloths were too fragile for performance, new backdrops were painted, and in August 1951 as part of The Festival of Britain celebrations, the marionettes took to the stage again as The Old Time Marionettes, at the Riverside Theatre, Festival Gardens, Battersea Park. In the 1980s George Speaight lent the troupe to puppeteers  in Germany but in the late 1990s he sold them to John Phillips, whose widow sold them to The Theatre Museum after his death in 1998.",

The cover of the music sheet is illustrated with an engraving of a woman begging, accompanied by this figure, fiddling.  The lyrics, sung by the begging woman, explain the fiddler's appearance:\n\n                               HOW CRUEL WERE MY PARENTS\n\nOh! cruel were my Parients [sic], as tore my Love from me,\nAnd cruel was the press-gang who took him off to Sea,\nAnd cruel was the little Boat, as row'd him from the Strand,\nAnd cruel was the great big Ship as sail'd him from the Land.\nSinging too rol loo rol loo rol too rol loo rol loo.\n\nOh! cruel was the Water, as bore her Love from Mary,\nAnd cruel was the fair wind, as would not blow contrary,\nAnd cruel was the Captain, and the Botswain and the Men\nAs didn't care a fair-din' if we never met again.\nSinging too rol loo rol loo rol too rol loo rol loo.\n\nOh! cruel was the Splinter as broke my Dreary's Leg,\nNow he's oblighed to fiddle for't, and I'm obliged to beg,\nA vagabonding Vagrant, and a rantipoling Wife\nWe fiddle, limp and scrape it thro' the ups and downs of life.\nSinging too rol loo rol loo rol too rol loo rol loo.\n\nOh! cruel was th'engagement in which my true love fought,\nAnd cruel was the Cannon-Ball, as knock'd his right Eye out,\nHe used to leer and ogle me, with peepers full of fun,\nBut now he looks a-skew at me, because he's only one.\nSinging too rol loo rol loo rol too rol loo rol loo.\n\nMy Love he plays the Fiddle, and wanders up and down,\nAnd I sings at his Elbow, thro' all the Streets in Town,\nWe spends our days in harmony and wery [sic]seldom fights\nExcept when he's his Grog aboard, or I get queer at Nights\nSinging too rol loo rol loo rol too rol loo rol loo.\n\nOh! cruel are the Bobbies, as makes my Love move on,\nThat dear old faithful timber-toe he can hardly walk upon,\nHis voice to me sounds very sweet, although he's rather hoarse,\nHe's always got a shocking cold as it's always getting worse\nSinging too rol loo rol loo rol too rol loo rol loo.\n\nOh! cruel was the Bank as broke, in which was all our tin,\nAnd cruel was the Manager as took my true Love in\nWe've not a blessed Shot now left, the Locker's up the spout,\nSo my true Love and me will sing, and fiddle our lives right out\nSinging too rol loo rol loo rol too rol loo rol loo.\n\nThen Ladies take all the warning, by my true Love and me,\nTho' cruel fate should cross you remember constabncy,\nLike me you'll be rewarded and have all your heart's delight\nWith fiddling in a Morning and a drop of Gin at Night\nSinging too rol loo rol loo rol too rol loo rol loo.\n\nA manuscript letter written by Harriet Clowes to Gerald Morice (Gerald Morice Collection, Theatre Museum), gives the shorter version that she said they performed, with patter:\n\n                                     TOMMY 1-LEG SONG\n                               Performed by Tommy 1-leg and his wife Mary\n\nVerse 1 (Mary):\nLadies and Gentlemen, I will sing to you a song\nIt's but a little ditty and I'll not detain you long\nIt's all about my husband as you can plainly see\nHe lost his right eye and his leg\nWhen going out to sea\n\nPatter:\nMary\nYou did lose your eye in the battle, didn't you Tommy?\n\nTommy\nAgh, that I did, Mary. I have only got one left now\n\nMary\nNever mind my darling I love you just the same\n\nChorus (Tommy): \nTiralee-lay lido, tiralee lay\nTiralee-lay lido. Tiralee lay\nTiralee-lay lido, tiralee lay\nTiralee-lay lido. Tiralee lay\n\nVerse 2 (Mary):\nMy love he plays the fiddle through every street in town\nAnd I sing at his elbow as he wanders up and down\nWe spend our lives in harmony, we very seldom fight\nUnless he takes some grogg on board\nAnd I take gin at night\n\nPatter \nTommy:\nAh, you like your drop of gin at night don't you Mary?\n\nChorus (Tommy):\nTiralee-lay lido, tiralee lay\nTiralee-lay lido.
