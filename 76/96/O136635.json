The taste for using illusionistic painted figures as a form of house decoration probably originated in the trompe l\u2019oeil, or life-like interior scenes painted by Dutch artists in the early 17th century. Dummy boards continued to be produced into the 19th century. They were placed in corners and on stairways to surprise visitors, or in front of empty fireplaces in the summer. Most were made by professional sign-painters, who also produced the hanging street signs prevalent until the late 18th century.\n\nThis example depicting a man with a cane is of particularly high quality and is painted on canvas attached to the board to prevent shrinkage.",
