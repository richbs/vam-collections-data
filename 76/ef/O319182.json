On either side of a decorative tapestry band there are three bands (between 6-13mm wide) created from the use of a golden linen for the weft. Each of these bands starts/ends with a double weft. The tapestry band uses a variety of coloured wools (dark blue, pink, light blue, yellow, white, green, red,pink, purple) to create a complete pattern. There are geometric stacks at each end and in the middle there is a band of yellow with a curved line of a different colour and dots either side of it. On either side of this band are bands of light blue also with curved lines in a different colour, and shaped either side of the line. The two long edges of the band have dark blue and yellow lines.  Three sides of this fragment have been folded under to make a rectangle with the fabric and there are stitch holes to suggest it was sewn to something else (in antiquity or modern?). The other edge has been folded over (upwards) and a hem created. The edge, and 10mm inwards, have been sewn down with 2 ply strings of dark blue S twisted threads and undyed linen Z twisted threads. They are sewn down with light blue, 2 ply Z, threads in a whip stitch. The remains of these strings are still attached.",
