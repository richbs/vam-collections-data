It shows a large Peter Pan collar in natural suede with rounded, pinked edges, and trimmed with colourful machine appliqu\u00e9d strips of leather in a criss-cross pattern. The shaped, two-piece collar is embellished in the centre with two large pompons in two shades of brown wool and with brightly coloured wooden discs.\n\nUsing simple dressmaking techniques with undisguised machine work, and naturally textured fabrics in unusual combinations, Pablo & Delia produced a bright and offbeat look typical of the early 1970s.",
