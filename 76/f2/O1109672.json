Full Citation:\n\n\u201cISAAC OLIVER\n\n<b>143 ?A Member of the Barbor Family,</b> c. 1590\n\n<i>Victoria & Albert Museum (887-1894)</i>\nVellum stuck onto a playing card with two diamonds verso, oval, 37 x 29 mm, 1 15/32 x 1 13/16 in.\n\nFor the sitter see below.\n\nTraditionally this miniature is of William Barbor, a grocer of Protestant persuasion who was saved from the stake by the accession of Queen Elizabeth in 1558.  In remembrance of his delivery he is said to have had the Barbor Jewel made (V&A 859-1894) and both it and the miniature were bequeathed to the elder sons to have a daughter called Elizabeth.  In the case of the Jewel stylistically it belongs to the 1580s (<i>Princely Magnificence</i>, V&A 1980 (41)).  Barbour died in 1586 and so it is arguable whether it was made for him or not.\n\nThe miniature, however, cannot be him but it is more likely to be one of his sons.  It also cannot be by Hilliard, an attribution up until now challenged for it is executed in a stipple style which was used by Isaac Oliver.  The portrait is not easy to date due to the lack of visible costume but the short hair and collar seem to indicate a date in the earl 1590s (cf. Strong, <i>The English Icon</i>, p. 196 (147) dated 1589; 199 (no. 152) dated 1590).  With its indications of architecture in the background and medallic profile format it anticipates Oliver\u2019s portraits of Prince Henry <i>\u00e0 l\u2019antique</i> (no. 230).\n\nThere are slight paint losses and scratched on the collar and losses, which have been restored, in the background and at the edge.  The gold edgeline has been restored in places; faded features and oxidized silver.  It is in a contemporary turned ivory case.\n\nCOLLECTIONS: In possession of the Blencowe family who inherited it by the marriage of the last Elizabeth Barbor to Henry Prescott Blencowe of Thorby Priory, Essex sometime after 1757; presented by Miss M. Blencowe, 1894.\n\nLITERATURE: V&A, 1947 (30).\nAuerbach, <i>Hilliard</i>, pp. 180, plo. 180; 297 (64).\u201d\n",
