The original gown may have been a sack back and was possibly remade sometime between 1760 and 1780 into an English-style pleated back.  The gown was cut and reconfigured for fancy dress 1870-1900.  The apron-style petticoat was intended to be worn open at the front, over a white quilted silk satin petticoat, c1750s (came with the bodice & petticoat, but condition too fragile - in unreg).\n\nThe pattern of the silk comprises two large bunches of flowers and fruit including narcissus, roses and grapes, each repeat in different colours.  The design has a strong diagonal arrangement, curvilinear emphasis and is finely shaded in a variety of colours.\n[Petticoat] The petticoat is made of 5 panels of silk and retains its original seams and piecing.  It appears to have been made from the back, trained section of a sack-back gown.  It has been configured into an apron to be worn open at front over a quilted petticoat\n[Bodice] The bodice retains the original back, front and lining of the 18th century gown.  The sleeves and neck are made of 19th century silk.  Whalebone at the back has been added in the 19th c.",

The original gown may have been a sack-back style and was possibly remade sometime between 1760 and 1780 into a gown with an English-style pleated back. It was cut and reconfigured again for fancy dress sometime between 1870 and 1900.\n\nThe pattern of the silk comprises two large bunches of flowers and fruit, including narcissus, roses and grapes, which is repeated the length of the silk in different colours. Characteristic of English Rococo silks are the diagonal emphasis of the design, curvilinear shapes and fine shading of the colours.",
