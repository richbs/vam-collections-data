She often uses images which suggest female activities and crafts, and references the work of earlier women artists in her own. Her works are extremely ornate and decorative (qualities which are often condemned in art but which are found in many of the textile crafts associated with \"women's work\"). The word Schapiro invented to describe her medium was \"femmage\", using this to refer to the combination of paint and fabric in compositions with a theme or meaning that pertained to women, and taking her imagery and icons primarily from the women's sphere of culture and life: quilts, houses, clothing, fans. Her collaborative artworks are made in this vein: she 'collaborates' with the work of female artists. Such works serve two purposes for Schapiro: they allow her to pay homage to artists whose legacy she wants to preserve, and they provide her with a framework for her own artistic agenda.\n\nFrida and Me is a multilayered portrait of the artist Frida Kahlo (1907-54; famous for her self-portraits) with Kahlo's features melded with those of Schapiro. The image various processes and print media to achieve a rich tapestry-like effect.",
