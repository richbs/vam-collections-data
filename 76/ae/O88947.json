Its graphic feel comes from Edward Bawden's design training and the special qualities of linoprinting. Being rather soft and crumbly  it cannot produce fine lines and works best with bold and uncluttered designs. Taught by graphic designer Paul Nash, Bawden began his career when the boundaries between fine and applied art and design were becoming blurred. This is shown by Bawden's varied career as fine artist, graphic designer and designer of ceramics and wallpaper.  \n\nBawden also approached book illustration as a designer. He said: 'the illustrator was not just a watercolour painter handing in his work to the printer and letting him get on with it, instead he considered himself a designer, a member of a team responsible for producing a book in which type and decorations harmonized'. He illustrated many books during a long career and also worked for the Curwen Press in the 1920s and 1930s designing wallpaper and borders.",
