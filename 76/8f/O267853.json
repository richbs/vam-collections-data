It was intended for a new bank building in Philadelphia which had 20-foot high windows above the doors. Larsen's challenge was to design a non-stretch, stable fabric that would act as a curtain without interfering with the movement of the doors beneath. The fabric, which he called 'Interplay', is a non-woven warp-knitted textile made from fine Saran (plastic) thread. It was designed to be flame-retardant, resistant to fading and soil, and easily washed. The plastic construction also meant that it could be heat-set to permanently hold its folds in position. When made in dark colours, it helped reduce sunlight glare without affecting the views through the window.\n\nAlthough in the end the bank did not commission Larsen to do their interiors, he believed so strongly in the merits of 'Interplay' that he continued producing the fabric until 1986.",

He wrote in related company literature that 'This unique warp knit construction firmly holds the straw-like yarns in a lacy open filigree, which is flame retardant, sun resistant, soil resisting and easily washed. The dark colors are especially useful in revealing a view while reducing glare.'\n\nInterplay was developed with the hope that it would lead to commissions from companies and institutions, and help publicise and expose the company, which had no advertising budget.
