The novel, first published in part form between 1836 and 1837, concerns a club set up by Pickwick and his friends Tupman, Snodgrass and Winkle. This figurine was first issued around 1920 by Royal Doulton, and its production continued until 1939.\n\nRoyal Doulton began in Lambeth, London, in 1815 when John Doulton manufactured ceramic items such as stoneware bottles and sewer pipes. The Victorian revolution in hygiene and sanitation ensured its success, and Doulton later produced tableware and commemorative items.  They moved to Burslem in The Potteries in 1882, and were granted a Royal Warrant in 1901.  \n\nThe Pickwick figurine has the number HN556 on its base and the initials AB. HN numbers were added to Royal Doulton wares from 1913 and stood for Harry Nixon, the firm's artist and designer with overall responsiblity for painting the figures.  The initials AB show that Arthur Barlow was the artist who worked on this figure.",
