            "public_access_description": "Gilded silver trays for serving food and drink were extravagant items in the 19th century. The large size of this particular object suggests that it was probably produced for display only. The naturalistic oak-leaf and acorn decoration, although not common on silver sold by the goldsmiths Rundell Bridge & Rundell, had a patriotic symbolism at a time when Britain was at war with France.\n\nBy the early 19th century, the immense wealth of Britain's richest citizens enabled them to patronise the luxury trades of coach-builders, cabinet-makers and silversmiths. The Prince Regent (Later George IV) and his aristocratic contemporaries set the style of what became known as the Regency period. They were indebted to the most prestigious firm of London goldsmiths of the age, Rundell, Bridge & Rundell. The company supplied silver at the forefront of fashion. Their large design studio included important artists such as John Flaxman and Jean-Jacques Boileau.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
