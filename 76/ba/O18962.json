The shape, and the form and layout of the design, shows that it copies a metalwork dish of engraved bronze inlaid with silver. However expensive and luxurious, ceramics were always more plentiful and cheaper than high quality metalwork since they were manufactured in greater quantities. \n\nMaterial & Technique\nThe body is made of 'fritware', a type of earthenware composed largely of pulverised quartz rather than clay. It allowed the potter to make shapes of precise and thin form. The opaque white glaze provided a smooth, fine surface for the decoration. The lustre technique is  one of the most complicated and difficult in all ceramic technology. It results in a layer of a metallic copper-and-silver mixture being laid on the surface of the glaze. This gives the metallic and mother-of-pearl reflections for which lustreware is especially prized.\n\nPlaces\nMany kinds of ceramic were made at sites across Iran, in towns and villages, wherever a sufficient market existed. A few of the more sophisticated and difficult techniques appear to have been the monopoly of an individual potter, or of a small group. Lustre was one such technique. In the medieval period it was made only by a few workshops in the small town of Kashan on the edge of the central desert. From here, the lustre potters supplied tiles for large-scale installations in buildings across the country. Bowls and dishes were traded even further east, and as far west as Egypt. \n\nHistorical Associations\nThis dish is thought  to have been one of a large group found in Jurgan in north-east Iran. Its pristine condition - as good as when it was drawn from the kiln some 800 years ago - suggests that it was never used. It may have been buried for safe keeping  by a merchant in the face of the devastation of the advancing Mongol invasions of the early 13th century. He did not survive to recover his treasures.",

In 1220, Jurjan was threatened by a Mongol invasion. The merchant packed the vessels in sand inside large storage jars and  buried them for safekeeping. Soon afterwards, Jurjan was completely destroyed by the Mongols, and the owner never returned to recover the hoard.As a result, the vessels in this hoard survived together for almost 800 years, and in relatively good condition. The probable date of their burial also gives us a good indication of when the vessels in the hoard were made, as well as showing the wide variety of types of decoration that were used to make Iranian pottery at this time.\n\nClement Ades gave a large number of objects found in the Jurjan hoard to the Victoria and Albert Museum at different times. Their object numbers are C.152 to 171-1977, and C.35 to 49-1978.",
