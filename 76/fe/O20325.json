The interior is lined with green laid paper (stuck down with adhesive), to which are applied 197 white feldspathic stoneware casts of gems and impressions from gems, each of which is numbered above in ink. The numbers run from 1100 to 1299, the sequence of numbering corresponding to that used in the Wedgwood & Bentley catalogues of ornamental productions. The following gems and numbers were omitted from the sequence, though space was allowed for their later inclusion: 1252, 1268 and 1287. Number 1249 is present but numbered in a later hand, and gem number 1281 was possibly stuck down later, as it is unnumbered. The front upper edge of the draw is numbered 130 in ink. Gem number 1102 was loose on acquisition and was found to have this number impressed on the reverse (it has now been reattached). The tray is one of three such trays, probably from Josiah Wedgwood's personal reference collection, the others being C.112 and C.113-1999.",
