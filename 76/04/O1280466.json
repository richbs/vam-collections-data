The wig foundation, made nowadays of nylon net is stretched onto the block and attached with metal pins known as 'points'. The base remains on the block while the wigmaker threads or 'knots' each hair individually into the base, gradually creating the full wig. The weight of the block is important for stability and ease while the wig is made and dressed. This block, one of a group of four presented to the museum, may well have been acquired by Stanley Hall, the founder of Wig Creations, from a sale of the effects of the Victorian wigmakers Gustave's, although the precise provenance is unknown.",
