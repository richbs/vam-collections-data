            "public_access_description": "The decoration on this coffee pot, with Chinese figures delicately painted in polychrome enamels and framed in iron red, pink lustre and gilding, is characteristic of much painting at Meissen from the early 1720s to the 1740s. Both the specific type of Chinese figure designs used on this pot, and the full palette of enamel colours used to realize them, were innovations introduced by Johann Gregorius H\u00f6roldt (1696-1775), an artist who had previously worked at the Vienna porcelain factory. Meissen had struggled to decorate its porcelain with colours until H\u00f6roldt was appointed in 1720. During the 1720s H\u00f6roldt developed new enamel colours and processes and introduced new designs, including the type of Chinese figure scenes used here. Known as chinoiseries in the West, these portray China as a fairytale land with exotic landscapes and quaintly dressed inhabitants engaged in leisurely pursuits. Over a thousand individual sketches for figure subjects of this type are included in a design book H\u00f6roldt began compiling in 1723-1724 (the \u2018Schulz-Codex\u2019), and he published six others as etchings in 1726. By 1730 he was supervising forty-six painters of chinoiseries.The \u2018Schulz-Codex\u2019 includes many sketches of Chinese men wearing hats featuring the same bizarre split rim as that worn by the man on horseback on one side of this teapot, indicating that its decoration was closely based on designs by H\u00f6roldt.",
