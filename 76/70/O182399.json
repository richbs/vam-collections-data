This butcher's shop set was part of a popular line of models  that Hacker began producing in the mid 1870s. The shop features over twenty removable pieces and  may have been used as an educational tool to teach children,  particularly girls, about the different cuts of meat. The meat featured includes wild boar and the cuts are continental. The shop was probably made for export since the text is in English.",
