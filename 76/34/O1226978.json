The shell makes a sound half circle for the seat before rising in a gentle S-curve with a rounded top to form the back. The form is made explicit by a symmetric diminishing repetition of the outer shape moulded into the shell. The original 'air skin' upholstery (strech nylon with a synthetic coating) had been degraded with significant losses and was replaced. During the re-upholstery the original foam was replaced as well.",

Long had joined the furniture design course at Trent Polytechnic as a lecturer in 1975 and gave the chair to Briggs in the early 1980s when he was clearing out his studio.  Briggs stored the chair in a garage which accounts for the extremely bright whiteness of the shell.   \n\nBriggs described the manufacture process thus; \u2018the original patterns for it as I remember were made in fibreglass, the original full-size design work being sculptured up in plaster and clay to a very high standard first, then the fibreglass pattern was made, then a mould was taken using a white gel coat, backed up by layers of fibreglass to give strength etc, foam was added [this is the connection with dunlopillow] and then it was upholstered.\u201d  This chair is though made of ABS and on the specification drawing the material of the vacuum formed shell is described as 2mm ABS.",
