A decade later this updated version was mass produced, also under the name of \u2018Microvision\u2019, differentiated by the name TV1A. These new sets were aimed at an executive market, and retailed at an average cost of $400, which made them \u2018ounce-for-ounce, more costly than solid silver\u2019. The TV1A was also the world\u2019s first multi-band television, meaning it could be used in almost every country; the inclusion of three types of battery charger also demonstrates that it was intended for an international market. The small, black and white screen could be viewed comfortably from a distance of about 30cm.\n\nHistorically, the TV1A was a significant move for Sinclair, as it represented the first time they had developed their own hardware rather than adapting existing components. Sinclair again updated the design in 1978, launching the more streamlined TV1B.",
