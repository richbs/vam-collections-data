Iron rich clay collected from the mineral rich soil of the paddy fields created the warm and subtle gradations in colour, as illustrated on this tea vessel. Manipulation of firing and cooling techniques within the kilns created dynamic surface decoration that was both simple and restrained. The reddish purple hues of this tea jar, caused by an abundance of ash within the cooling kiln, were a form of kiln mutation known as 'Yohen' and were particularly admired. These visual effects, previously considered the detriment of hasty and cheap manufacture, became to be appreciated on Bizen wares due to their unique rustic appearance and elegant simplicity.   \n\nThe large robust shape of the jar made it ideal for the storage of tea, keeping it fresh and dry. The impetus for the production of tea jars was due to the increasing popularity of the tea ceremony during the Momoyama period (1573-1615). Bizen, one of the first areas to manufacture tea wares during the late sixteenth century, produced specially commissioned pieces for tea-ceremony enthusiasts.",
