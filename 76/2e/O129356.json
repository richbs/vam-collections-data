The figure of the god of war, Mars, is elongated in away that is characteristic of mannerism, a sixteenth-century style especially popular in France.\n\nEtienne Delaune was born in Milan but made his career in France before going into exile to avoid religious persecution.

His engravings of mythological and allegorical subjects, and especially his ornamental designs for jewellery and goldsmiths' work, of great precision despite their small dimensions, contributed to the spread of the Fontainbleau style among a wide variety of artists and craftsmen in France and abroad.'\n\nMarianne Grivel: \"Delaune, Etienne\" Grove Art Online. Oxford University Press, 20/12/2006, http://www.groveart.com/\n\nPublished a total of around 450 prints. 'Many of Delaune's prints are small oval panels with figures allegorical of such themes as the senses, the months, hunting, the Gods, the Labours of Hercules, the virtues and the Bible. His figures are almost invariably elongated mannerist nudes.Delaune also published numerous small panels of elaborate and dense grotesque ornament, some oval, others rectangular....During his Strasbourg and and augsburg period Delaune published numerous dense grotesques for engraving or enamelling on pendants, crosses, miniature cases etc. some dated 1573, 1578 or 1579...'\nJervis p.145",
