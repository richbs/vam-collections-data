His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nMozart\u2019s opera Le Nozze di Figaro (The Marriage of Figaro) (1786)  was performed to celebrate the twenty-first anniversary of the Glyndebourne Festival Opera in 1955.  Critics praised Messel\u2019s exuberant pastiche of 18th-century art and design \u2018The d\u00e9cor by Oliver Messel was in his richest and most inventive vein, fully emphasising the unique blend of sharp satire and human understanding for the folly and unhappiness of the characters which Mozart so perfectly caught in his music\u2019 (The Tatler, 22 June, 1955).\n\nMessel designed a flamboyant costume for the intriguing and mischievous Figaro, the Count\u2019s valet and adversary.  Striped dark blue jacket and breeches are matched with a bright lime green waistcoat.",

Oliver Messel\u2019s production was first performed by the Glyndebourne Festival Opera at Glyndebourne on 8 June, 1955.   It was directed by Carl Ebert and featured Bruscantini as Figaro and Elena Rizzieri as Susanna.  It was revived at Glyndebourne in 1956, 1958, 1962, 1963 and 1965.   \nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's theatre designs and other designs and artefacts.  The designs were briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being housed at the V&A from 1981 on indefinite loan.  The V&A Theatre Museum purchased the Oliver Messel collection from Lord Snowdon in 2005.\n\nHistorical significance: At the height of his career, Messel designed costumes and sets for operas at Glyndebourne, 1951-1959.",
