As a set and costume designer she worked extensively for major British opera companies, notably for Sadler's Wells Opera (which became English National Opera in 1968).  \n\nRichard Rodney Bennett's first full-length opera The Mines of Sulphur (1965) is an eerie tale set in the 18th century. Braxton, a lord, is murdered for his wealth by an army deserter, aided by an old tramp and Braxton's mistress, now the deserter's lover.  As they celebrate in their victim's decaying manor house, a mysterious troupe of actors arrive and entertain the thieves with a play, The Mines of Sulphur. The play's events mirror the crime and the actors are revealed as supernatural agents of retribution.  \n\nLeda is one of the actresses. Alix Stone's design for the character gives the intended effect but does not provide precise details as these can be worked out later with the costume maker. The fabric swatches indicate the desired colours and material.",
