In 1888 he became a publisher in his own right with offices at 24 St. Bride Street, London. He appointed the writer and editor, Robert Ellice Mack, as director. \n\nNister specialised in high quality colour printing for children in the last quarter of the 19th century. Movable books with various mechanisms became his speciality after 1890 (when be published his first stand-up book) but he also produced numerous picture books, annuals, poetry, nursery rhymes, calendars and greetings cards. He worked with a core of writers, including Clifton Bingham and Robert Ellice Mack, and illustrators, in particular Eveline Lance, Harriett M. Bennett, Edith A. Cubitt and Rosa Petherick. \n\nEdith A. Cubitt produced this pen and ink drawing (hand-coloured by A. Gunston) for the nursery rhyme, Ten Little Nigger Girls, published as an 'untearable' book by Ernest Nister in London and E. P. Dutton & Co. in New York, and printed in Bavaria in ca.1895. The nursery rhyme is a counting rhyme, beginning with ten little girls and ending with one.\n\nThis genre, which also included Ten Little Nigger Boys, was popular at the end of the 19th century.  The term 'nigger' was used in Europe and America to describe a person of black (sub-Saharan) African ancestry from the 17th century. It began to gain pejorative associations from the 1800s but was used in book titles of the 19th century without racist intent. The term is repeated here in its original historical context.",
