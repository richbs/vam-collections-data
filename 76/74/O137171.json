W. Godwin. The department became known for its brand of 'Aesthetic' dress, inspired by costumes of the past, and made in beautiful silks, some made in India and the Far East, dyed in vibrant but natural colours.\n\nThe design of the coat was registered with the Patents Office in 1913, and it was clearly a popular pattern as the copyright for the design was extended twice, up until 1928. It is an ingenious design, being fully reversible, and constructed out of only one piece of each of the two face fabrics.",
