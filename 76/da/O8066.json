The Wedgwood copies were produced in a 'first edition' of about 50, potted during Wedgwood's lifetime. This example comes from that series. \n\nThe Portland Vases are generally held to be among the greatest of Wedgwood's achievements. He died shortly after this triumph, in 1795.\n\nMaterials & Making\nAlthough Wedgwood had borrowed the original vase as early as June 1786, it was not until October 1789 that he succeeded in making the first good copies. Difficulties with the Jasper body ranged from cracking and blistering (clearly visible here) to 'lifting' of the reliefs during firing.  In 1786 he feared that the Jasper reliefs could never be applied thinly enough to match the subtlety and delicacy of theglass originals. On some 'first edition' vases, including this  one, the effect was achieved by a combination of undercutting and shading the reliefs in grey. \n\nUse\nWedgwood made the copies to demonstrate his technical skill. They were shown privately between April and May 1790 and the exhibition was so popular that restrictions on the number of visitors were necessary. To this end only 1,900 tickets were printed. One such ticket, illustrated by Samuel Alkin and printed with 'Admission to see Mr. Wedgwood's copy of The Portland Vase, Greek Street, Soho, between 12 o'clock and 5', was bound into the Wedgwood catalogue on view in the British Galleries (museum no. 22.12.71). \n\nLater the vases were exhibited in Wedgwood's London showrooms. They would have been admired and displayed by connoisseurs and collectors as works of art.",

ISBN 1851773088.\nThe Portland Vase, a Roman cased-glass vase of about 30-20 BC, was in the eighteenth century the most celebrated artefact to have survived from ancient Rome. Of Greek amphora form, it is of the darkest cobalt blue translucent glass, with decoration of white opaque glass carved in cameo relief. Once called the \"Barberini Vase\" (because it was in the Barberini family collection in Rome from 1626 for nearly 150 years), it passed through a number of owners before coming into the possession sometime before 1785 of the dowager duchess of Portland, from whom it derived its present name. The Portland Vase is known to have been cracked in 1786, and then in 1845 it was smashed into more than 200 fragments by a drunken visitor. Restored at that time, it was purchased by the British Museum in 1945 and was more expertly restored by the museum in 1948, and again in 1988-89. The vase remains an iconic image, prominently displayed at the British Museum and known worldwide through mass-produced reproductions of generally poor quality.\nIn 1786 the Portland Vase was loaned by the third duke of Portland, the duchess's son, who purchased it at auction after the duchess's death, to Josiah Wedgwood for the purpose of making a limited-edition copy in jasper ware (a hard, fine-grained stoneware of Wedgwood's invention).\nWedgwood's pottery exemplified the \"industrial arts,\" and work from his factory was prominent among the ceramics collected for the Museum of Practical Geology, with which Henry Cole was closely involved. Included in the Wedgwood material represented there was Josiah Wedgwood's famous copy of the Portland Vase, which he had perfected in 1790 after four years of painstaking trials; the copy was introduced at his London showrooms in an exhibition open to those members of the nobility and gentry who had applied for admission tickets.\nAlthough copied by other manufacturers of ceramics and glass, the Wedgwood version came to serve as a symbolic icon for the whole of Josiah Wedgwood's life and achievements and, increasingly, as a masterpiece of English applied art. As such, it appears on the spines of Eliza Meteyard's monumental 1865-66 two-volume biography of the potter; and Wedgwood is shown holding his Portland Vase copy in both Edward Davis's monument to him at Stoke-on-Trent (unveiled in 1863), and in the sculpture of him included in the pantheon of ten English craftsmen on the 1909 fa&#231;ade of the Museum. There is a paradox here, for although the copy can be taken as the crowning technical achievement of Josiah Wedgwood's work as a potter, those made in his lifetime were extremely costly, limited-edition productions - full-blown works of art made as exhibition and presentation pieces. Thus, they scarcely represent what nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century admirers saw as his greatest accomplishment - the harnessing of art and design to the needs of commerce and industry.\n\nLit.

Wedgwood started making pottery vases during the 1760s and 1770s, initially in his variegated and Black Basalt wares. The vase was the symbol of the highly fashionable 'Antique' style and there was a great demand for Wedgwood vases. The copy of the Portland Vase, perfected in 1790, was Wegwood's most celebrated vase and one of the final achievements of his career. The first perfected copy of the Portland vase generated considerable public interest when it was exhibited at Sir Joseph Banks' Soho Square house and then at Wedgwood's Greek Street Show Rooms. 1,900 tickets to view the vase at the show rooms were printed.\nJosiah Wedgwood's first copies of the Portland Vase are ranked among the grestest technical acievements of the potter's craft. Wedgwood spent a number of years perfecting a technique for the production of ornamental vases in Jasper ware. In 1777 he discovered that the use of a coarse body, disguised by a thin dip of a fine body, gave the vase sufficent strength to hold its shape during firing. Several years of trials were needed before this technique could be satisfactorily applied to vases. The first of Wegwoods Jasper vases were shown in 1781/2 at his Greek Street showrooms. During the following ten years he continued to experiment with colours, shapes and ornament. Between 1786 an 1790 much of his time was devoted to experiments and trials devoted to the reproduction in Jasper of the Portland vase. These were greatly aided by his invention of a 'pyrometer' for measuring the temperature in pottery kilns.",
