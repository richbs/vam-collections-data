The gateways each have two square upright pillars with three architraves, all of which are elaborately carved in relief with scenes from the Buddha's life and stories from the Buddha's previous existences (jatakas).\n\nThe northern torana consists of two square posts crowned with a group of four elephants beside each of which is a female nature spirit (yakshi) leaning out, holding onto the branch of a mango tree. The carvings depict scenes taken from the Chhaddanta Jataka and the Vessantara Jataka. The middle panel shows the temptation of Mara. Lions sit on the ends of the architraves, above the scroll designs. On top of each pillar, on the topmost architrave, is a wheel surmounted by a trident shape (triratna), flanking a group of elephants in the centre together with a standing guardian holding a fly whisk (chauri).\n\nThe eastern torana also has groups of elephants encircling the tops of the two square pillars beside which is a yakshi grasping a branch of a mango tree (the one to the right of the photograph is in fact missing). A single wheel and triratna appears at the top of the left hand pillar, with elephants standing at the end of the architraves above the scroll designs.",

Markings on the top of the buff-coloured mount indicate the way in which the object was categorised.\n\nHistorical significance: The hilltop site of Sanchi comprises the remains of stupas, temples and monastic buildings. Abandoned from the 14th century, Sanchi was 'rediscovered' by a British officer, General Taylor, in 1818. However, it was not until 1881 that restoration work was initiated. Between 1912 and 1919 the structures were restored to their present condition under the supervision of Sir John Marshall, Director General of Archaeology in India.\n\nThe Great Stupa (known as Stupa 1) at Sanchi is the most important and complete surviving monument of the Shunga era (circa 185-175 BCE). The original mound was a brick structure built by King Asoka during the 3rd century BCE. During the late 1st century BCE it was enlarged to twice its original size, the dome was encased in sandstone slabs and a walkway was constructed on the ground level and marked with a stone railing (vedika). A square structure (harmika) was constructed on top of the mound which contained a three tiered umbrella (chattravali), representing the three jewels of Buddhism - the Buddha, the dharma (ethical precepts of Buddhism) and the sangha (community of Buddhist monks). Four stone gateways (toranas) were built around the stupa, one in each cardinal direction. Each gateway comprises two upright stone pillars with three architraves, elaborately carved in relief with scenes from the Buddha's life and stories from his previous existences (jatakas).\n\nThe stupa form developed out of hemispherical funerary mounds, the earliest being used to enshrine the remains of the Buddha himself. Over time, stupas came to commemorate the Buddha's spiritual achievement, his enlightenment and teachings. Smaller stupas were built as votive objects at Buddhist holy sites, often clustered around larger stupas.",
