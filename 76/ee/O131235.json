With Vanessa Redgrave as Carlotta, and her brother Corin Redgrave as her ex-lover Sir Hugo Latymer whom Carlotta threatens to ruin, this was the first time  they worked together in the West End. The production opened with the star cast, including Matthew Bose, at the Gielgud Theatre on the 20th October 1999, having originally been produced with different actors at the King's Head Theatre.\n\nA Song at Twilight, a dark comedy, was set in a hotel in a luxurious Swiss hotel in the 1960s. The Independent review noted: 'The actors benefit no end from Simon Higlett's handsome sets and Shirley Russell's excellent costumes which carefully delineate the characters', and that of The Express: 'Any other actress would have refused to wear a skimpy frock, but Vanessa gamely exposes lumps and bumps of middle-age the part demands.'  Shirley Russell did a lot of design for film with her ex-husband Ken Russell but little theatre work, and was specifically asked by Vanessa Redgrave to design this production.",
