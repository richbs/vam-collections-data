He was known for his skill with colour, which he used quite vividly. \n\nSpitzer produced his lithographs first as gouache or watercolour drawings, which then had to be translated into plates one corresponding to each the many different colours. Lithography involves drawing or painting on stone with a greasy crayon or ink. The greasy areas pick up ink from a roller passed over the surface, which is moistened to prevent the ink from sticking to the areas left clear? The image is printed on paper using a flat-bed printing press. A separate stone is needed for each colour.\n\nPoet and scholar Walter Strachan (1903-1994) had a fascination with the art of the book and wrote many articles on the subject. He visited France every year to build his collection as well as bringing books back to show other possible buyers such as the V&A Museum. His collection of owls began with a visit to artist Roger Chastel (1897-1981) in 1952, where he witnessed the printing of the Le Bestiaire de Paul Eluard. In his diary, Strachan says, \u201cMy article on Chastel\u2019s Bestiaire had the happy result of bringing me a special print on Auvergne paper of the owl which I had admired in the book. Contacts in the art-world of Paris are close and friendly, and I was marked down as an owl-man, in consequence of which I have gradually been given dedicated owl prints and originals in every medium from pen and ink to enamel...\u201d Many were one-off gifts or greetings; some were proofs from artist books.",
