There is a diamond shape opening underneath the arms, bound with black cotton fabric. There is no sign of fastenings. There are shaped panels over the hips; there is no cross-over at the front.\nYellow and gold ground [silver strip open S-wound on yellow silk core] patterned with two designs, one laid over the other. An angular light blue line edged with dark brown forms a stepped and lobed lozenge-shaped lattice with 2 slightly different compartments. One is more convex than the other. Each contains a central rosette and a small floral arrangement in each corner - the exact design is different in the differently shaped segments. The colours are pink, light blue and green.  In addition there is a dark line which creates almost circular compartments cutting over the lozenges.\nMain lining: plain weave cotton, pink ground printed with offset bands of a left-bending boteh made up of a pair of horizontal green leaves, 2 white flowers with dark red and purple details, 2 pink and red blossoms and a top spray of red and white buds.\nIn each sleeve the lining is glazed roller-printed cotton with stripes: dark brown, light blue and red with floral patterns in red, green, yellow, white and light blue.  The red stripe is decorated with a line of yellow-edged botehs.",
