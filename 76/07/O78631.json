The basic form of knives and forks had also become standardised by this date.\n\nHistory & Use\nThe steel blade of the knife has a 'tang' or rod at the base that fits into the hollow handle, which is then packed with resin.  By the beginning of the 19th century, the rapid advances in mechanisation had led to a standardisation of shapes and designs of cutlery and flatware (spoons and forks). The die-stamped fluted, tubular handle is decorated with the 'Hourglass' pattern, a variant on the standard King's pattern, itself based on French 18th-century designs. The broad, straight, parallel-sided blade has a rounded tip, and this form was standard throughout the 19th century. Since ceramic or enamel handles were prone to damage, their use gradually declined, and silver handles came back into use.",
