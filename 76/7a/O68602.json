At the other two angles of this triangular format  are full figure images of women. One (Vyjayanthimala)  is dressed in a brightly coloured sari , her hair is  shown loose to indicate her role as a prostitute.  The other (Suchitra Sen)  is wearing a  white sari with neatly tied hair. This indicates the difference in social status  between them. The titles run across the bottom of the poster",
