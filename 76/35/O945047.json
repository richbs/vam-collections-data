Dr H. Wellesley (sale, Sotheby, 9 July 1861, lot 35, bought by Colnaghi); bought 1885 An etching by Francesco Brizzi representing the arms of Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini is based on this or a similar drawing (Bartsch, 18, p. 261, no. 15; reproduced, 2nd state, in Bodmer, pI. 123). Bianconi's certificate states that the drawing, no. 27 in his collection, is Lodovico's design for Brizzi's etching and that it is ehbraved also in a book of facsimile prints illustrating the Bianconi collection. The facsimile, engraved by G. B. Frulli, is pl, 23 in Saggio di disegni della rinomata raccolta presso il Sig Ab. Don Carlo Bianconi, segretario Perpetuo della Reale Accademia di Brera, Bologna, n.d. The tracing made from the drawing with a stylus was probably the work of Frulli, whose aquatint is a faithful copy, whereas Brizzi's etching differs from the drawing in several respects. Two other drawings of the same subject are known and have been discussed in print, without reference, however, to our sheet, which was presumably unknown to the writers concerned. One of these drawings is at Windsor (Wittkower, Windsor, p. 108, no. 75; Bodmer, p. 155, no. 203, fig. 122); and the other is in the Albertina (inv. no. 2095; Albertina Catalogue, 6, no. 76; Bodmer, 'Drawings by the Carracci' in OMD, 8, no. 32, March 1934, p. 55, fig. 9, mistakenly described as the Windsor drawing; Bodmer, p. 154, no. 172, where the mistake is corrected). In the upper part of the design the etching differs substantially from all three drawings, showing an eagle on top of the shield instead of a cardinal's hat. The Windsor drawing, which is furthest away from the etching, is accepted as Lodovico's design by Bodmer, but rejected by Wittkower, who suggests that it is possibly by Brizzi after Lodovico. The Albertina drawing, which comes a step nearer to the etching, is likewise attributed by Bodmer to Lodovico, more convincingly, to judge from the handling. Our drawing is similar in design to the Albertina sheet, but approaches nearer to the etching in so far as the bottom of the shield, which is rounded in the Albertina drawing, is here cut into two scrolls, exactly as in the etching. It is doubtful whether our drawing is by Lodovico. It is more probably by a pupil, perhaps by Brizzi, though the design is still some distance away from the final form adopted in the etching.",
