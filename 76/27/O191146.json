            "public_access_description": "This poster is a typical example of the spontaneity and informality of the FIDESZ (Alliance of Young Democrats) electoral campaign in 1990. These were the first free elections in Hungary following the collapse of communism.\n\nThe colour orange and the form of an orange fruit were fundamental elements of the party\u2019s graphic identity.  Orange recalls the expression \u2018Hungarian orange\u2019 from Peter Bacso\u2019s film \u2018A tan\u00fa\u2019 (The Witness, 1969) that criticised the anomalies of the communist regime in the nineteen fifties.  One of the lines from this extremely popular tragi-comedy rapidly became a catchphrase in Hungary: \u2019it is little bit yellow and a little bit sour, but it\u2019s ours\u2019. In this phrase, people saw the essence of life under communism aptly formulated. Magyar Narancs (Hungarian Orange) was the title of a newspaper, founded 1989 by young publishers, several of whom became active members of the Alliance of Young Democrats.  Another point of reference was the Polish opposition movement \u2018Orange Alternative'.\n\nAnother important element of the party\u2019s identity is the the graffitti-like lettering of the name FIDESZ (an abbreviation of Fiatal Demokrat\u00e1k Sz\u00f6vets\u00e9ge/Alliance of Young Democrats). FIDESZ sounds similar to the Latin word \u2019fides\u2019 (trust) and the campaign played on this. \n\nThe slogan of this poster was as popularised as a hit song. Its rhyming form is lost in the English translation.",
