The crowbill was a variety of saddle or poll axe intended primarily for use as a close quarter weapon from horseback. As such it was one variety of saddle axes widely adopted by cavalry fighting in the Indo-Persian tradition. \nThe crowbill has a thickened, armour piercing blade. Unlike a conventional saddle axe, the crowbill has no hammer head opposite the blade. The elephant motif has a practical as well as symbolic function. The figure counterbalances the blade as well as symbolises strength. There may also be an allusion to the elephant-headed Hindu deity Ganesh as 'Remover of obstacles'.\nThe curved blade could be used either in sweeping, hooking attacks overarm or with an underarm polo-like swinging motion at approximately head height. The devastating results of such attacks at speed from horseback against opponents on foot can only be imagined.",
