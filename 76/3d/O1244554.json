Entered RA Schools 1807. Briefly a midshipman in the Royal Navy 1808. Exhibited 48 portraits at the RA between 1809 and 1838, and 40 works at the BI 1815-59. Early works were portrait miniatures; appointed Painter in Miniature and Portrait Painter to Princess Charlotte 1815. Won a BI prize for 'The Prophet Ezra' (1815). Studied in Rome 1815-18, with the 6th Duke of Bedford as his patron, and exhibited thereafter historical, biblical and mythological subjects as well as maintaining a successful portrait practice. Published an essay on the classification of colours, as an appendix to <i>Hortus Ericaeus Woburnensis</i> (privately printed 1825). In Italy and Paris 1826-31; visited the Continent in 1844 and 1846. Although he failed to be elected ARA (in 1825) - probably because he lived with his mistress and not his wife, he was a member of several Italian academies, and was appointed Painter of History and Portraits by both King Leopold of the Belgians in 1830 and Queen Victoria in 1837. He succeeded Sir David Wilkie as Painter in Ordinary 1841; knighted 1842. Held a one-man show in the Egyptian Hall, Piccadilly, 1843. Many of his works were engraved; he was also an accomplished etcher. He married three times: in 1809, 1846, and (according to the <i>Illustrated London News</i>) 1863. Died Marylebone, London, 18 January 1871; his studio sale was at Christie's 19-21 April 1871. His brother John was also an artist, as was his son Angelo. \n\nLIT: <i>Athenaeum</i> 28 January 1871, p1l9 (obit); <i>Illustrated London News</i> 28 January 1871, p91 (obit); <i>Art Journal</i> 1871, p79 (obit), 1879, p180; B Coffey <i>Drawings by Sir George Hayter</i> ... exhibition catalogue Morton Morris 1982\"",
