The cup and cover (1909-10) by Child & Child of Thurloe Place, South Kensington, in a revived, German Renaissance manner illustrates the prevailing mainstream taste for historicism while the Painter and Stainers\u2019 Cup designed by C.R. Ashbee for Harris Heal (1900-01) is a very contemporary and subtle restatement of a 17th century design and epitomises the essence of the British Arts and Crafts movement.  \n\nBy 1900, Ashbee and his Guild of Handicraft had a achieved a stylistic maturity.  For a while the Guild even showed a modest profit but events were moving swiftly.  In the 1890s the work produced by the Guild struck a fresh and original note.  By the 1900s, Ashbee was to witness others adapting his ideas and extending them further.  The workshops of Henry Wilson, Nelson Dawson and Edward Spencer of the Artificer\u2019s Guild, Omar Ramsden and in Denmark,  Michelsen and Georg Jensen began to produce work that was richer and more self assured than the austere, products of the Guild of Handicraft.  These firms successfully popularised the Arts and Crafts philosophy and occasionally incorporated Art Nouveau tendencies.  The retailer A.L. Liberty of Regent Street with his Cymric range of silver and jewellery was the amongst the most successful and all remained commercially viable long after the demise of the Guild in 1908.\n\n(Graphic panel:  the Silver Galleries)",
