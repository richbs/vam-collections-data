            "public_access_description": "This unfired clay figure appears to be the model for the monument to Sir Lionel Tollemache, 3rd Earl of Dysart (died 1727), whose monument of 1729 is in St Mary's Church, Helmingham, Suffolk. The model also bears close similarities with that of the figure of the 2nd Baron Lexington (1661-1723) on the monument (1726) to him and his wife in St Wilfrid's Church, Kelham, Nottinghamshire. Indeed, until recently the clay figure had been thought to be connected with the Lexington monument. The pose of the figure also closely imitates that of John Sheffield, 1st Duke of Buckingham, on the marble monument to him in Westminster Abbey, London, designed by Pieter-Denis Plumier (1688-1721) and executed in about 1721 by Laurent Delvaux and Peter Scheemakers. Although the clay figure was previously attributed to William Palmer (1673-1739) on the basis of the contract for the Lexington monument, which records the involvement of Palmer in the erection of the monument itself, he was probably merely the mason responsible for overseeing that task; the figure of Lexington may well have been designed and executed by Scheemakers.\n\nPeter Scheemakers (1691-1781) was born in Antwerp and trained under his father, the sculptor Peter Scheemaekers the Elder (1652-1714). Scheemakers was in London by 1721, where he first collaborated  with Pieter-Denis Plumier (1688-1721) and Laurent Delvaux (1696-1778) on the monument to John Sheffield, 1st Duke of Buckingham, for Westminster Abbey. Scheemakers continued in partnership with Delvaux, carving funerary monuments as well as garden statuary. They went together to Rome in 1728, where Scheemakers remained for two years before returning to England in 1730 and setting up an independent workshop. He spent the rest of his working life in England, concentrating on monuments and portrait busts",
