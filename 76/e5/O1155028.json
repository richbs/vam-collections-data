This was published pre-Suburban Press and Sex Pistols, but mused on the same themes of upsetting the malaise in the current order. This printing was possibly created to be used in Sex Pistols artwork, but never progressed beyond the copy.\n\nJamie Reid's cut-and-paste aesthetic developed from his interest in radical politics. His artistic style developed while at art college in Croydon, where he was influenced by the ideas of the avant-garde political group, the Situationist International. The political slant to his art was aroused by the May 1968 Paris student riots, which inspired fraternal protests organised by Reid at the Croydon College of Art. These were directed with fellow student Malcolm McLaren, later to become the manager of the Sex Pistols.",
