            "public_access_description": "Costume design by Kenneth Rowell for the ballet Laiderette choreographed by Kenneth MacMillan to music by Frank Martin.\nLaiderette was created by Kenneth MacMillan for the Sadler's Wells choreographic group on 24 January 1954 and redesigned by Kenneth Rowell  when it was taken into the repertory of Ballet Rambert on 4 July 1955 and performed at Sadler's Wells Theatre, London and on tour. Its title is taken from   the French ' from the French \u2018laideronette\u2019, 'little ugly one' but, allegedly to avoid confusion with regional audiences thinking it had anything to do with  new launderette,s it was called Mask and Face for touring purposes. It remained in Rambert's repertory until 1967.\nThe narrative of the ballet tells how a young girl, Laiderette, is abandoned on the steps of a grand house wher a Mask Seller supplies her with a mask.  Here she is drawn into a masked party and falls in love with the host but he recoils when she is unmasked and discovered to be bald. Laiderette was a  sensative ballet with an air of fantasy. This collaged design shows a pierrot character in white mask and ragged brown dress over a crinoline and brown  feathered hat. Peter Williams describing the designs for the ballet in Dance and Dancers September 1955 writes of the 'mousey brown's of the poorer  characters which blended with the soft pastels of the rich. 'Of course there are rags a-plenty and, though we have suffered a surfeit of rags from French  designers, these are different. The dingy reds and browns take on the quality of Indonesian Batik in the costumes of the Pierrots. Their masks and  make-up have the age-old yet ageless sheen of yellowing oriental ivories.' With Rowell's designs for Laiderette Williams claimed that Marie Rambert  had found her 'best post-war designer'",
