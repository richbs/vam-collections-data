Upper end has one row of stitching in light purple wool the 7 shoots of green wool followed by 2.5 cms. of plain weave with light brown weft turned and stitched in place.\n\nDESIGN: field has a cream ground; there are nine vertical lines largely in purple and they rest on a saw-toothed diagonal lattice.  The bottom left/top right lines are in purple, the others in red, dark blue and green.  Within the lattice the bar bears a cross-shaped motif with a green or blue cross above and below a light orange octagonal centre.\n\nThe main border extends along the sides and lower part only; the lower border and the lower one-third of the sides have a blue ground and the upper sides a green ground.  Red, stepped lozenges alternate along the sides with hooked bars.  The bars are part light orange and part cream.  On the lower border the motif changes to opposing arrowheads in either cream or light orange.\n\nThe inner and outer borders are along the sides and lower part only and have a reciprocal \"running dog\" pattern in cream and purpole with outer guard stripes in cream and blue.\n\nThe upper border lies along the top of the five-sided field and the side borders.  It has a purple ground filled with narrow horizontal lozenges in contrasting colours.  The border is divided vertically by the central line which extends beyond the field to the tip of the pile.",
