They were not for day-to-day use. Often settees were supplied for the state bedrooms, along with sets of chairs to match.  They were arranged around the walls of the room. The upholstery would match the hangings on the bed. This settee was probably made for Hampton Court, Herefordshire, for Thomas, Lord Coningsby (1656-1729), but we do not know which room it was for. It is unusual for the upholstery to have survived untouched.\n\nDesign & Designing\nHigh-backed furniture was ideal for showing off expensive, brightly coloured fabrics.  Unfaded fragments of the cover of this settee reveal strong red and yellow tones, contrasting with the blue braid and fringing.  The settee is in the form of the 1690s, with a shaped top rail, outward-curving wings and scrolled arms.\n\nMaterials & Making \nThe cover is decorated with cross-stitch embroidery with a floral pattern imitating damask, a woven fabric.  The legs and stretchers between them are carved and turned walnut,  ebonised (painted black to look like ebony), with traces of gold stencilling.",

Coningsby's career was then at it's height: he fought alongside King William III at the Battle of the Boyne and was rewarded with an Irish Peerage in 1692. His second marriage, in 1698, was to the daughter of the Earl of Ranelagh.  No bill for the settee has been found. The legs match a set of chairs and a settee in crimson silk damask, which were supplied en suite with a state bed, now at Het Loo, The Netherlands. The upholstery of the V&A settee, however, is canvaswork embroidery in red and brown wool and stamped yellow wool.  The room for which it was supplied has not yet been identified as the house was remodelled in the 1790s and again in the 1830s. The 17th century furnishings remained in the house until 1925.   The settee was  found in attic by subsequent owners of the house in about 1910 and sold at the house sale in 1925.  It was bought by the V&A from Frank Partridge and Sons Ltd in 1945 having passed through the ownership of Colonel Mulliner, a collector of English furniture, and Lady Baillie. The state bed from Lord Coningsby's bedroom is in the Metropolitan Museum, New York.\n\nNotes from R.P. 45/1192 & 1227\n\n12/9/45 memo, Ashton to Edwards\nrequests authority to purchase the settee.  \"It is a double-chair settee with high back and is entirely upholstered in original needlework.  Illustrated pl.4 Vol 3 of Dict. Of English Furniture and came from Hampton Court, Leominster, a celebrated repository of 17th century furniture.  Few exist with original coverings and this is a fine example.  It was recently sold by Lady Boullie who had acquired it from Col. Mulliner (collector & dealer).  Ashton says Partridges are unaware of its importance and the price of \u00a3350 is moderate (the Hampton Court settee of the same date was sold to the late Duchess of Rosbury for \u00a31500).  He proposes to purchase it from the Bryan Bequest Fund.\n\nPartridge invoice of 17 Sept. 1945\nLists as \"William & Mary walnut settee, the high back, seat and loose cushion covered in needlework of cream ground with all-over formal design in red.  On shaped legs joined by curved stretchers. -- \u00a3350.\"\n\nHistorical significance: In form the settee is a typical example of the high-backed upholstered seat furniture fashionable in the 1690's.  The embroidered covers are unusual; silk damask or cut velvet were more often used.  The upholstery has great historical value as it has never been removed from the settee, apart from the outside back cover of stamped yellow wool. It is exceptionally rare to find upholstery from 1690 still surviving.",

            "historical_context_note": "In the 1690s upholstered settees formed part of the lavish furnishings of the state rooms of a great house, which were created to demonstrate the wealth and status of the owner.  Often, settees were supplied with sets of chairs ensuite, and were upholstered to match a state bed. Their high backs were ideal for showing off expensive fabrics, which were usually brightly coloured. Fragments of the embroidered covers which have not been exposed to the light reveal the strong tones of the original red and yellow thread, which would have contrasted with the blue of the braid and fringing. This settee was almost certainly commissioned by Baron Coningsby when he remodelled and refurnished his house in the 1690s.  However, it is not known for which room it was intended or whether there were any chairs supplied ensuite.  The legs of the settee match those of the settee and chairs in the King's bedroom, which were covered in crimson silk damask to match the bed.  The King's bedroom was furnished in preparation for a possible visit by William III; there is no evidence that he actually visited the house. The V&A settee could have been supplied for another bedroom or an anti-chamber to a bedroom.",
