He has exhibited in several exhibitions in Korea and abroad including \"From the Fire: contemporary Korean Ceramics\", 2004-2007, in the U.S.\n\nThis work represents three trees, grouped together. The foliage has blended together forming one single tree. \nThe walls of the piece were built up from base to top using small coils of clay assembled together in a net-like open-work structure. The artist plays between binary oppositions and thus creates a balance/tension between weight vs lightness, full vs empty. The volume and imposing size of the piece evoke weight whereas the openwork structure actually brings lightness and elegance.\n\nThe piece was shown as part of the  exhibition Tradition Transformed  (from 20 May to 3 October 2011 at the V&A.) Tradition Transformed   showcases the work of contemporary Korean ceramic artists who combine traditional methods with modern ingenuity and innovative techniques.",
