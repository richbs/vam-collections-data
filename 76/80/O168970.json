There is a selvedge of 2 white cotton threads down the right hand side.\nDark satin ground with a very lustrous dark brown warp and a black weft. The pattern wefts are red and metal thread; the metal thread has largely worn away. It is silver strip open s-wound on a yellow silk core.\nThere are rows of large, left-bending botehs worked in metal thread with red centres to the small flowerheads inside each boteh. At the tip of the boteh is a second tiny boteh in metal thread with no red silk details. The ground between the botehs is filled with small motifs including left-facing lionesses [?] below each boteh; a pair of birds face this animal. Between the animals is a vase of flowers with a red-dyed bird above and in between the large and small boteh is what seems to be a red-eyed fish.",
