It was also the time when famous Italian fashion designers were at the forefront of the fashion world.\n\nThe Bulgaris, of Greek origin, came to Rome in 1881. Today's flagship store in the Via Condotti, where the rich and famous bought their jewels, was opened in 1905. Bulgari is today represented worldwide. \n\nThis bracelet belongs to the Gemme Nummarie (Coin Gems) series which have become Bulgari's trademark, intermingling their Greek roots with Roman culture. In the mid-1960s Bulgari resumed the ancient tradition of mounting coins in jewellery, and since then has continued to integrate ancient coins from different countries and periods into varying modern designs. This series has proven to be one of their great successes.",

One of  the systems of ordering by the individual branches is that representatives come to Rome on particular days in the year and, having seen the models on offer, place their orders.\n\nHistorical significance: The bracelet combines two characteritic features of Bulgari jewellery: the <font -u>Tubogas</font> technique, which was first used  by Bulgari in the 1950s (compare the bracelet by Cartier  made in 1937, M.144-1987), and the mounting of  coins,  a fashion which Bulgari championed from the mid-1960s.  Daniela Mascetti and Amanda Triossi (see references, 1996, p. 119) describe how the mounting of coins  was revived almost by accident following gifts of  Roman coins to Nicolo Bulgari by his godfather to mark his wedding anniversaries..  Coins have taken on great significance in Bulgari jewellery and are referred to as 'Gemme Nummarie'.\n\nMascetti and Triossi suggest that\n\n'the reason these apparently insignificant gifts have had such enormous consequences  for the development of Bulgari style is that the use of coins in the context of jewellery in many ways reflects the firm's aspirations.  Bulgari has always been proud of  its origins, rooted in the classical Greek tradition and enhanced by Roman culture.  By using ancient Greek and Roman coins in modern pieces of jewellery Bulgari is making overt reference to its Hellenic origins grafted in Rome.  This confirms the attention to its cultural heritage and the necessity of continuity with the past - an idea which is very dear to the heart of Bulgari.' (1996,  p.122).",
