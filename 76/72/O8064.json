Its style and decoration imitates fine French earthenware ceramics with detailed inlaid decoration known as either Saint Porchaire or Henri II wares that were produced for the French court around 1550.\n\nDuring the 19th century, amid the burgeoning popularity of arts from the Medieval and Renaissance periods, these rare French ceramics became highly desirable collectors\u2019 items. Earlier than this, in 1774, the renowned collector and gothic revivalist Horace Walpole is known to have had a Saint Porchaire ewer at his home in Strawberry Hill. \n\nThe original Saint Porchaire wares were amazing feats of labour and skill with intricate inlaid decoration, a complexity which doubtless contributed to their rarity. Over the centuries, these techniques had been lost.\n\nIt was Minton\u2019s Art Director, L\u00e9on Arnoux, who rediscovered the techniques required to produce such complex inlaid decoration. He produced the first \u2018Henri II\u2019 wares in 1858, combining inlaid and painted decoration. Arnoux taught these techniques to Charles Toft Sr. and Minton continued to produce pieces in this style into the 1890s.",
