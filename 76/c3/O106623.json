They originated in the 1440s with the desire to reproduce coins and hardstone engravings from ancient Greece and Rome. Some were made as collector\u2019s pieces, to be viewed and displayed in private, and others for practical purposes. They also inspired designs in other media, from architecture to bookbindings. Little is known about this mysterious artist. Some believe his name is a Greek pseudonym for Riccio as they both mean \u2018curly head.\u2019 Even if they were not the same person, Ulocrino was probably a member of Riccio\u2019s circle. This plaquette represents an allegory of music and perhaps formed part of an inkstand or casket.",
