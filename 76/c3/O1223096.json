            "public_access_description": "Mirka Rozmus is an Australian weaver who specialises in creating unique hand woven silk scarves. Originally trained as a classical violinist, Rozmus ran her own Design Studio in Sydney creating couture garments from her hand woven fabrics. She gave up her musical career in 2002 to concentrate on weaving full time.\n\nRozmus trained under Peter Townley, also a musician, who ran a weaving course at the Tasmanian School of Art, before moving to Sydney in 1984. Every year she travels to Kyoto in Japan to purchase the traditionally hand dyed silks from which she weaves limited edition scarves. She uses the traditional method of handweaving, working on an eight shaft, foot powered jack loom; this is a lengthy and precise method of handweaving as the warp alone may contain over 2,000 fine silk threads. Rozmus weaves only two or three scarves per warp and never reproduces an original design. Each finished scarf is individually named and allocated an 'archival number' before being rolled on a hand made silk covered roller, wrapped in Japanese paper and placed in a box, also designed by Rozmus and hand made in Kyoto.\n\nThe inspiration for this scarf was drawn from Rozmus' childhood; the 'Woodimals' were strange caricatures of whimsical beasts, roughly carved from trees and discovered in a now-forgotten, jungle like park. Rozmus and her sister would climb on these strange creatures, playing 'mysterious' games. Whilst she was weaving the scarf, Rozmus came across a very old photograph of herself, sitting on a 'Woodimal' and she wanted to honour their fond memory. The sombre colours of the warp stripes evoke the stark trees of this fantasy place, through which the sunset or sunrise is visible. On the reverse the brilliant colours sum up everything the artist feels a jungle should be - alive, vibrant and yet alien; remote, not really a place for humans.",
