The back is covered with a dark brown pattern fabric with is possibly a satin or heavy silk.  It is folded over a raised section which supports the figure and above the figure the material is pleated into a sunburst design trimmed with looped gold metallic threads which also frame the outer edge.  Across both the top and the bottom are bands of artificial flowers in reds, blues, pinks, white and green cottons and velvets.  Additionally there are black beads, gold threads and black metal frame underneath decorated with green leaves and brown stem.  In the centre of the top band is a gold metallic bead and sequin 'star'.  Below the figures head is a pillow of matching fabric with gold metallic braid.\nThe figure is a baby in swaddling clothes representing the Christ Child.  The head is wax, probably solid, with painted facial features (black eyes, brown brows and lashes, red mouth).  The hair is curly blond mohair glued to the head.  Behind the head is a halo of spiral gold metallic thread.  The swaddling is white pattern shiny fabric, satin or heavy silk or the man made version, with bands of gold metallic braid and tie of gold metallic cord at the lower end.  Around the neck is a loop of white artificial pearls.\nThe outside of the box is covered with a heavy cream paper patterned with gold stars and a stylized fleur de lys.
