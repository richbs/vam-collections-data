It represents three stages in the Life of Christ: the Nativity, the Crucifixion and the Glory of God in heaven. The Virgin Mary is here modelled by Isabella Cay, the painter's sister. Veneration of the Virgin was characteristic of Roman Catholicism but treated with extreme suspicion in Anglican circles in Victorian Britain. The centrality of the Virgin in this design thus reflects the High Church sympathies of All Saints' congregation. The colour scheme of the work is also unusual at this date. Its clear blues, pinks and greens, and the prominent gold haloes, were derived from early Renaissance altarpieces. They contrasted with the much darker palette of conventional 'Old Master' religious subjects then prevalent. The design is in an original frame that the artist is believed to have been designed.",

Studied medicine and theology at Marischal College, and for a few months at the RA Schools in 1825, before making his first visit to Rome, where he presumably made contact with the 'Nazarene' painters. Exhibited 41 works at the RA between 1827 and 1861, four at the BI 1828-41, and 58 at the RSA. Specialised in mythological, historical and biblical subjects, also portraits and landscapes. Elected ARA 1844, RA 1848. Influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites, notably in 'Pegwell Bay' (1858, Tate Gallery). Involved in reorganisation of art education; appointed Superintendent of the School of Design 1837, resigned 1843. Active as ecclesiologist and musicologist. Several fresco paintings for Prince Albert and the Palace of Westminster. Died 15 February 1864 Streatham, London; studio sale at Christie's 5 May 1865. A typed transcript of selected correspondence is in the Dyce Papers, Aberdeen Art Gallery.\n \nLIT: M Pointon <i>William Dyce</i> Oxford 1979 (with full bibliography) \n\n<b>Design for a Fresco for All Saints, Margaret Street</b> \n164-1894 Neg X1431 \nCanvas, 130.1 x 87 cm (51\u00bc x 34\u00bc ins) \nPurchased 1894 \n\nA study for the fresco on the east wall, behind and above the altar, of the chancel in All Saints, Margaret Street. All Saints was designed by William Butterfield as a model ecclesiologist church and built between 1850 and 1859. Dyce's design for the wall accords with the principles of the building and contrasts with the more Pre-Raphaelite and naturalistic style particularly in terms of a 'contemporary Christ' - of his religious easel paintings (see M Pointon 'William Dyce as a painter of Biblical subjects', <i>Art Bulletin</i> 1976, pp260-8), and with the greater monumentality of his Palace of Westminster frescos. The 1964 Aberdeen exhibition catalogue quotes the artist Edward Armitage (no source cited) commenting: 'For correct and careful drawing, for taste and style in the arrangement of drapery, and for honest and conscientious labour I know nothing in England to equal them'. \n\nWhile Thompson suggests that Butterfield's choice of Dyce for the commission reflected the architect's progressiveness, Pointon disagrees on the grounds that Dyce's ideas were more conservative. Pointon cites the patron of the church, Alexander Beresford Hope, corresponding with Dyce by 1851 about the iconography of the fresco; the artist's consent to paint the fresco was described by Hope as a 'piece of success unlooked for and surprising'. Pointon comments that it was also surprising that Dyce should have accepted the commission having made so little progress with the great project for the Queen's Robing Room at the Palace of Westminster, particularly as the church was originally due to be completed in 1853. The fresco was still unfinished in 1857, when Cope refused to assist with the painting (C W Cope <i>Reminiscences</i> 1891, p224). Presumably the present oil study dates from about 1851. It is not possible to see Dvce's fresco itself, because of Comper's later screening of the wall (see below). \n\nPointon rightly stresses that the painting was intended to act as both a reredos and an east window as well as a wall fresco. The structure of the design is based on 15th and 16th-century examples, although the figures and their disposition are more 14th-century Italian in origin (see, for example, Nardo di Clone's 'Three Saints' bought by NG 1857). In the late 'thirties Dyce had studied the school of Giotto, and Pointon suggests that he followed Ruskin's urging in <i>The Seven Lamps of Architecture</i> (1849) towards the Italian Gothic and knew Mrs Jameson's <i>Legends of the Madonna</i> (1852). A copy of Zanotti's 'Pinacoteca\u2026 ', which was illustrated with engravings after Italian Gothic altarpieces, was lot 211 in his studio sale. \n\nThe iconography of the work is fully discussed by Pointon. The three horizontal zones of the wall show the Virgin and Child on the first level with the Crucifixion above, the scenes surrounded by the twelve Apostles standing in niches, while the uppermost level shows Christ in Glory, flanked by figures referring to Christ's life as a man on earth.\n \nThe fresco deteriorated rapidly soon after completion, and in 1908 J Ninian Comper was commissioned to make oil copies which were superimposed on Dyce's work. \nThere is a family tradition that the model for the Virgin was the artist's niece, Elizabeth Cay, and Pointon (p135) comments that 'the warmth, realism, and degree of finish in this part of the oil study bears out such a claim'. For a life study possibly for the head of Christ, see 156-1865, p73. \n\nPROV: Purchased from Agnew's March 1894 (possibly agents for the museum at the James Brand sale, Christie's 10 March 1894, although the work does not appear in the catalogue) \n\nEXH: <i>Ecclesiastical Art</i> Imperial Institute 1933; <i>William Dyce</i> Aberdeen Art Gallery 1964 (27) \n\nLIT:  P Thompson <i>William Butterfield </i>1971 (pp349, 458); M Pointon <i>William Dyce</i> Oxford 1979, pp128-36, repr pi 138\"",
