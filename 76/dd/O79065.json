Prior to the introduction of the tea caddy after about 1780, early tea containers were referred to as canisters, sometimes kept in locked boxes known as tea chests. The canister was originally placed on the table while tea was served. It was often decorated with painting, like this one, or with marquetry.  This early example must  have been painted before 1717, the year Cradockdied.\n\nPeople\nMarmaduke Cradock was a painter of birds, animals and still life.  He had no formal art training, but was apprenticed to a house painter in London. The V&A also has two engravings of his paintings of birds in classical settings. They were originally sold at J. Sympson's print shop, in Russell Court, Drury Lane, London.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe front of the canister is painted with a variety of birds, including turkeys, a peacock and a dove, in a rural scene with a ruined thatched cottage. On the back are a pheasant, a duck and ducklings, and a crow, with a lake and trees in the background.  On the top, a  border of flowers surrounds a raised panel with an owl, cockerel, peacock and a thatched cottage.",
