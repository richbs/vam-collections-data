            "public_access_description": "Benjamin Turner was one of the first, and remains one of the greatest, British amateur photographers. He began practising photography in 1849 according to the technique patented in 1841 by the British inventor W. H. Fox Talbot (1800-1877). Turner's photographs were 'contact' printed from paper negatives (known as calotypes) of the same size as the print. He printed many of them on albumen paper, which is paper that has been floated on an emulsion of egg white containing light-sensitive silver salts. Between 1852 and 1854 Turner compiled 60 of his own photographs, including this one, in what is believed to be a unique album, 'Photographic Views from Nature'. It might have been a sample book, a convenient method for presenting photographs for personal pleasure, and for showing to colleagues or potential exhibitors. It remained in the Turner family until it was bought by the Museum. This is the only salted paper print in an album that otherwise contains only albumen prints. Light-sensitive silver chloride paper (\u2018salted paper\u2019) is made by first dipping a sheet of paper in a sodium chloride solution, and then coating one side of it only with silver nitrate.\n\nThe village of Bredicot near Worcester was the home of Turner's father-in-law, who had purchased Bredicot Court, shown here, when he retired from the business of porcelain manufacture, a trade that had made him wealthy.",
