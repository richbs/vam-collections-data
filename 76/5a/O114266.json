This was a publication describing the varieties of citrus fruit then in cultivation, with engraved illustrations of the fruit as well as views of gardens and of equipment for cultivating the trees. However, this particular drawing is not reproduced in Ferrari's book. It once formed part of the collection assembled by the great 17th-century antiquary and natural scientist Cassiano dal Pozzo. His collection of drawings is known as the 'Museo Cartaceo' or 'Paper Museum'. The majority of the collection passed into the British Royal Collections, where it remains, but in the 18th century several volumes of the drawings were sold and dispersed through the London art market. The V&A purchased several of these drawings in 1949, including other drawings of citrus fruits and two botanical drawings, all originally from Cassiano's collection.
