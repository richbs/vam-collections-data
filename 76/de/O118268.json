This was the popular improvised type of comedy which flourished in Italy from the 16th to the 18th centuries and had an impact on theatre throughout Europe, especially France. Commedia plays were acted along pre-arranged scenarios but relied on the performers' ability for improvisation and ensured their popularity with a mixture of knockabout comedy, acrobatic leaping and romantic interest. Various visiting Italian troupes performed in France in the 16th century where their type of theatre was called the Com\u00e9die-Italienne. By the 17th century however their plays were being performed largely in French, and by the 18th century Commedia dell'Arte was a recognised part of the French theatre. \n\nThe Doctor, or Dottore, was traditionally the pompous scholar from Bologna, an academic version of the greedy Pantalone.  His speech was often filled with malapropisms and gibberish and he was dressed in black except for a white collar.",
