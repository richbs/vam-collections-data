Although Ambrose Heal personally believed in the DIA principle of 'fitness for purpose', good design and traditional manufacture, he recognised a public demand for European Modernist and Art Deco styles. Chrome was first introduced in 1930 to successfully revive the recession-hit bed department, offering a chic yet fashionable alternative at half the price.\n\nWhile some of Heal's metal furniture was by Bauhaus designers such as Mies Van der Rohe (in the Economy Catalogue of 1933) and Marcel Breuer, the poster significantly shows pieces which follow art deco forms rather than pure modernist aesthetic. The shop's mailing list targeted people whose houses had a rateable value of over \u00a350 and owned a telephone, as well as designers and architects.\n\n[Julia Bigham, 'British Design at Home', p116]",
