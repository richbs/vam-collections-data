Flowers and bamboo grow around the pavilions. By one pavilion a man sits fishing and in the background is a bridge crossed by another man. Printed in madder reds and lilac with pale brown and pencilled blue. The outlines are accented in black. The yellow has fade from the bottom of the curtain, but at the top enough remains to show that much was used for the ground around the pavilions, for the costumes and for a soft double green in the foliage. The leaves are also overprinted with pink, giving a soft lilac shade. Two not quite full widths of the fabric are made up as a curtain, and lined with heavy ribbed cotton with a band of blue cotton added at the hem.",
