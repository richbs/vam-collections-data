The main cloth is tabby weave; approx. 26x20 tpc; s-spun; approx. 0.3mm thread dia. Approx. 20mm down from the fringe are four, separated lines of weft that have been thickened by using three or four threads of linen. 90mm below this a double row of decoration begins. Here the warp threads become double. Coloured wool (now faded) is used to create decoration but with much of the wool missing not much design remains. Each band (approx. 55mm wide) is filled with three ovals at the centre, outlined in foliated scrolled lines. The middle oval contains a naked human figure with a raised arm. The lowered arm seems to hold a ball. The other ovals may contain animals. At each end there is a reverse arcade border and a more solid looking segment. The decoration at the ends is missing. The piece has holes and is stained.",
