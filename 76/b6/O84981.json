After school in Yorkshire, worked in turn for a fishmonger, attorney, housepainter, and bookseller. Trained first as a miniature painter; acquaintance with John Bell (see FA253, p31) and his nephew Edward Bell led him to produce mezzotints; also made coloured copies from prints after George Morland and others. First oil painting was a portrait of his wife, which resulted in an introduction to Sir William Beechey RA. Exhibited 99 works at the RA between 1802 and 1845, nine at the BI 1815-42, and 15 at the SBA 1831-47. Almost all were portraits, and after 1816 many were of actors and theatrical scenes in the tradition of Zoffany and Samuel de Wilde. His studio in Gower Street became a rendezvous for the leading actors and actresses of the day. Elected ARA 1821; repeated failure to be elected RA resulted in his resignation 1836. Died Kensington, London, 10 May 1854.\n \nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1854, pp212-3 (obit by his pupil R W Buss) \n\n<b>Charles Young as Hamlet and Miss Glover as Ophelia</b> \nFA20 Neg 70312 \nCanvas, 128.9 x 96.5 cm (50\u00be x 38 ins) \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nExhibited at the RA in 1831, with the following title and quotation (from Shakespeare's Hamlet, act 3 scene 1) in the catalogue:\n \nMr Young in Hamlet \n<i>Ophelia</i>: My Lord, I have remembrances of yours that I have longed long to   re-deliver. I pray you now receive them. \n<i>Hamlet</i>: No, not I, I never gave you aught. \n\nThe identification of the actress as Miss Glover dates from the printed handlist of the Sheepshanks collection in about 1850, and has been retained in all the museum's printed catalogues except that of 1907, where she is described as Mrs Glover (as she is in the 1868 exhibition catalogue). It is not known why this alteration was made, and there is no evidence that Young ever played Hamlet to the Ophelia of the well-known actress Mrs Glover (1779-1850); he did play the part opposite Miss M Glover at Covent Garden on a number of occasions between 16 October 1826 and 8 October 1827. In the absence of further evidence, it seems likely that this painting records one of those performances. However, the identity of Miss M Glover is far from clear; according to Oxberry, none of Mrs Glover's daughters surviving in 1826 had a name with the initial M. \n\nThe catalogue of the 1868 exhibition refers to another portrait of Miss Glover by Clint in 'Scene from Paul Pry' (FA2l below); although there is some facial similarity between the two actresses, the 'Scene from Paul Pry' is known to represent Miss Phillis Glover, a daughter of Mrs Glover. \n\nIn FM Redgrave's Memoir of her father Richard (1891), a visit by him and Lord Palmerston to Sheepshanks's house at Rutland Gate is recorded on 12 December 1856; in the dining-room 'They were all interested in Clint's works, particularly with \"Miss Glover\" '. This is presumably the present work, or the 'Scene from Paul Pry' (FA2l, below). \n\t\nEXH: RA 1831 (281); <i>National Portraits</i> South Kensington Museum 1868 (571); <i>Royal Opera House Retrospective</i> 1732-1982 RA 1982-3 (152) \n\t\nLIT: <i>Oxberry's Dramatic Biography</i> IV, 1826, p27; G Ashton and I Mackintosh <i>Royal Opera House Retrospective</i> 1732-1982 RA exhibition catalogue 1982, p96\"",
