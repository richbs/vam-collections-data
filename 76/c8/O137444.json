This outfit (by Kansai's own judgment) was the star of the show.  It was worn with matching boots (given), and over a knitted woolen, tightly-fitting 'hot-pants' jumpsuit (not given).  Among the models for this show was Marie Helvin.  This London debut brought him an international spotlight and a long friendship with artists like Elton John, Stevie Wonder, and David Bowie, for whom he designed the outfits for the Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane tours.\n\nDavid Bowie said, for the Edo-Tokyo Museum's <i>Kansai</i> exhibition (2008), to which this object was loaned:\n\"The Kansai Yamamoto costume designs that Kansai and I chose for the Ziggy Stardust  and Aladdin Sane tours contributed significantly to pushing away from the 60's and for creating new sensibilities for the post-modern 70's.  Kansai's brave ideas brought Japanese clothes design to the forefront of fashion\".\n\nKansai references traditional Japanese culture in his designs.  The shape of this outfit is that of a Japanese kite and features a the face of a <i>yakko</i>, or old soldier, typically caricaturised in traditional theatre and dance.\n\nGiven by Mr Kansai Yamamoto as part of the Cecil Beaton gift.",
