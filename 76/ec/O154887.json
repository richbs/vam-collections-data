Its current appearance was probably created in London in about 1872\u201375, when the table and drawer unit that he had made was given new, and probably more decorative, legs and was fitted with a porcelain plaque made in the French royal factory at S\u00e8vres in 1759.  From the 1820s there was a growing and lucrative trade in London in French 18th-century furniture, and workshops soon became adept at creating new and more elaborate pieces, using elements of original furniture and adding both new and antique elements.  John Jones, who bequeathed a large collection of furniture, including this piece, to the Museum, was particularly interested in porcelain-mounted furniture but, like many 19th-century collectors, was sometimes taken in by made-up pieces.",

The main plaque, of S\u00e8vres porcelain, is dated 1759, and this appears to be an authentic mark, although it is likely that this was added to the table, probably in London in about 1872-5, when the legs were replaced, the lower shelf added and other alterations made. Garnier is not known to have used porcelain plaques in any other piece of furniture.  The porcelain plaque carries the mark attributed to the painter Jean-Pierre Ledoux",
