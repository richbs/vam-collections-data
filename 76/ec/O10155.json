Jesus tells the story of the rich man with two sons, the younger of whom asks for his inheritance before his father's death. Given this inheritance, the son embarks on a life of debauchery, losing the money in gambling, drinking and amoral women. The son then has to earn a meagre living as a swineherd, swines being declared unclean in Judaic law. This would represent the lowest point of his life. Co-workers encourage him to return to his father's house, where he might obtain better employment. Seeing him approaching, the father embraces his son and welcomes him back into the household, calling for the fatted calf to be killed for a banquet that evening in his honour. The eldest son who had remained home, working hard and not touching his inheritance was indignent and upset but his father declared: '...be glad for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; was lost, and is found.'\n\nThe scene here depicts the father embracing his son whose clothes are tattered and his labourer's hat lies on the ground before him. The oldest son stands in the background discussing the event with colleagues.\n\nThis type of moralising tale became increasingly common during the progression of protestantism in Germany and the Netherlands. Such images were considered to be models of moral virtue and not scenes of superstitious belief. The latter images were rapidly being destroyed as protestantism spread.",
