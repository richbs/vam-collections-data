This plaquette depicts Rheims Cathedral which was shelled and set ablaze by German forces on 20 September 1914, less than a month after Leuven in neutral Belgium had been attacked. Much of Leuven was destroyed, and universal condemnation followed the loss of its internationally defining moments for the Allies in much the same way that the sinking of the Lusitania in May 1915 was to draw American into the War. \n\nYencesse, known for his lyrical, softly-rendered images, portrays the famous statue of the Virgin and Child, from the centre doorway of the Cathedra's west portal adding a right forearm and hand holding the French lily to increase the propaganda function of this plaquette. Medals like this one may have been distributed to those who contributed to the rebuilding of the Cathedral as a reward and tangible reminder of the need to defend religious and cultural beliefs.",
