They are united beneath the seat by two rails with ogee-shaped mouldings.\n\n15th June 2005\n<u>Notes from Loan visit to Oakwell Hall:</u>\nPlank top 27mm thick\n\nBoth legs with good convex warp.\nLow level of wear under the feet, but some worm. \nOne leg split and repaired (bad knot?), with filler perhaps.\nThe plank top with moulded edge, and two channels running full length along the underside into which the stretchers (19mm thick) are fitted. The channels run through to the ends, extending 2.5cm beyond the legs. \nTwo large rectangular plugged mortises at one end, for which no obvious explanation.\n\nIrregular square pegs, slightly proud.\nThe legs and shoulders must be fitted together, then the top applied and joined.\n\n<u>Summary:</u> Plausible for c.1500.
