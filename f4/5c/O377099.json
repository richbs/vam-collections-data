It was made to contain snuff (powdered tobacco which was inhaled through the nose).\n\nOn the lid Bellona, goddess of war, shows the plan of a fortification to a warrior in Roman military dress.  The box, which was probably made in Germany, may have been owned by, or a presentation to, a soldier who took part in the campaigns fought in Europe in the middle decades of the eighteenth century, most notably the Seven Years War (1757-63). The warrior holds a grenade, a weapon of attack against fortifications, and a symbol of the grenadier companies and regiments which, because they included many of the strongest soldiers, frequently had the reputation of being \u00e9lite troops.\n\nThe warfare of the period called Bellona into action in art.  In Kew Gardens William Chambers designed the Temple of Bellona in 1760 to hold plaques commemorating the regiments which fought in the Seven Years War.",

However, as the Jones Collection Catalogue stated in 1924 'the design is too late for this' (see citation).  It is, however, entirely credible that this magificent and large box was a present to a military commander in the middle of the 18th century.",

It was an epitaph that could have been applied to most of his contemporaries, because war and its attendant military and diplomatic arts were the true sport of kings.' (Swann, Julian. 'Politics and the state in eighteenth-century Europe'. In T. C. W. Blanning, ed. <u>The Eighteenth Century: Europe 1688-1815</u>.  Oxford University Press, 2000, p. 17).\n\nFor Bellona during the Seven Years War (1756-63), see, for example,\n\n1.  Vignettes by Georg Friedrich Schmidt for the Quarto edition de luxe of Frederick the Great, <u>Poesies modernes</u>, published by Johann Friedrich Voss, 1760.  Among other roles Bellona appears 'showing a plan of a sieged city to a Prussian general: city in the distance' (British Museum registration number 1838,1215.406; quotation from British Museum Search the Collection Database).\n\n2.  Temple of Bellona designed in 1760 by William Chambers for Kew Gardens to contain plaques which bear the names of British and Hanoverian regiments which distinguished themselves during the Seven Years War.\n\nFor Versailles Charles Lebrun (1619-90) had painted Bellona in the Salon de la Guerre.\n\nThe grenade which the commander holds, and which appears again in one of the trophies, is an appropriate attribute for an 18th century soldier, but it may have a further significance.  It could be connected to a successful attack by the recipient of the box or to his command of grenadiers, who had a role in attacking fortifications. Grenadier companies or regiments, because they were formed of the most powerful men, acquired an \u00e9lite status.  \n\nThe style of the chasing, the form of the rococo ornament, and perhaps also the subject, suggest that the box was made in Germany.  The influence of German gold chasers in London was such that it can be difficult to differentiate London chasing from German, particularly on mounted objects.  While the figure chasing could have been executed in London, the ornament appears to have the refined and elegant scroll and shellwork which is associated with Augsburg (see for example, S. Grandjean, K. Aschengreen Piacenti, C. Truman, A. Blunt, <u>The James A. de Rothschild Collection at Waddesdon Manor: Gold Boxes and Miniatures of the Eighteenth Century</u>, Fribourg: Office du Livre, 1975, pp. 94-96).",
