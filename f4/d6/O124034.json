Entered RA Schools 1826. Worked as a drawing master in the 1830s. Exhibited 141 works at the RA between 1825 and 1883, 17 at the BI 1832-59, and 20 (including four watercolours) at the SBA 1829-35 and 1870-9. Early works were landscapes and costume pieces, mainly l8thcentury and in the manner of C R Leslie; from the 1840s he specialised in modem genre and social comment, before returning to landscape, particularly around his home in Abinger, Surrey, relieving the pressure of his administrative duties. Elected ARA 1840, RA 1851; Secretary of the Etching Club 1837-42. In 1847 he began his official career in art education as Master at the Government School of Design, becoming Head Master in 1848, Art Superintendent 1852, Inspector General 1857, and Director 1874. He was Inspector of the Queen's Pictures, compiling a catalogue of the Royal Collection, 1857-79. As he wrote in 1856: 'I regret to find that I am so identified with office work that it is almost forgotten that I am a painter' \n(F M Redgrave <u>Richard Redgrave: A Memoir</u>. . . p l 71 ). He published An <u>Elementary Manual of Colour</u>r ... (1853), <u>The Sheepshanks Gallery</u> (1870), and, most famously, with his brother Samuel, <u>A Century of Painters of the English School</u> ... (2 vols, 1866). He was offered a Knighthood in 1869, which he declined; created Companion of the Bath 1880. Died Kensington, London, 14 December 1888. His daughters Frances (who compiled the Memoir of her father) and Evelyn were also exhibiting artists. \n\nLIT: <u>Art  Journal</u> 1850, pp48-9 (referred to below as the 'autobiography'), with engr portrait; <u>Art Journa</u>I1859, p206; <u>Athenaeu</u>m 22 December 1888, pp854-5 (obit); F M Redgrave <u>Richard Redgrav</u>e, CB, RA: <u>A Memoir compiled from his diary</u> 1891 (referred to below as <u>Memoir</u>); F G Stephens in <u>Magazine of Art</u> XV, 1891-2, pp26-9; ed S Casteras and R Parkinson <u>Richard Redgrave</u> 1804-1888 1988, V &A and Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, USA, exhibition catalogue \n\n\n<b>The Thames from Millbank </b>\n211-1887 Neg FE1150 \nCanvas, 24.8 X 43.2 cm (9\u00be X 17 ins) \nPurchased 1887 \n\nExhibited at the BI in 1836, as <i>The Thames at Millbank</i>, the size given as 17 by 24 inches, presumably including the frame. It was acquired some time after by the artist's friend Thomas Webster RA. \nRedgrave was born and brought up in the area of Pimlico; the family moved from Belgrave Terrace to the King's Road in about 1814. The view depicted seems to be from the north by Lambeth Bridge looking across to what is now the Albert Embankment. Both banks have been transformed in the last 150 years, and none of the buildings in Redgrave's painting seem identifiable, although the church tower on the left is possibly that of St Mary the Less, Black Prince Road (built 1827-8). Before redevelopment, the south side housed Lambeth industries, particularly potteries, while the north side is described by Redgrave in the Memoir as a 'succession of osier-swamps'. \nJohn Ruskin, in a lecture to the BI in 1867, described this reach of the Thames as 'a disgrace to the Metropolis'. It is puzzling that the famous Millbank Penitentiary, on the present site of the Tate Gallery, is not visible. As Krzysztof Cieszkowski, of the Tate Gallery Library, has pointed out to the present writer, Redgrave seems to have forsaken topographical accuracy in making the right (north) bank appear more rural than it probably was, as well as eliminating Vauxhall Bridge and the Penitentiary. Vauxhall Bridge (that is, the earlier version built 1811-16) would have been visible; the later (1862) Lambeth Bridge was preceded by a ferry, which may be alluded to by the boat in midstream in the present work. The buildings in the right background may be houses along Vauxhall Bridge Road, the tall chimney part of one of the glue factories mentioned by Ruskin, and the white house an earlier version of the White Swan. (For a fuller discussion of this area, see K Cieszkowski 'Millbank before the Tate' in <u>The Tate Gallery 1984-86: \nIllustrated Biennial Report</u> 1986, pp38-43.) \n\nPROV: Thomas Webster RA; his sale, Christie's 21 May 1887 (182), bought Agnew's for the museum \u00a316 16s (with 210-1887 'Quentin Matsys in his Studio', p246). \n\nEXH: \tBI 1836 (83); <i>Richard Redgrave</i> 1804-1888, V&A and Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, 1988 (4) \n\nLIT: <u>Casteras and Parkinson</u> ppl01-2 (repr) \n\n\n\n\nRonald Parkinson.\"",
