            "public_access_description": "This nightcap is a typical example of informal headwear for a wealthy man.  Although only worn in the privacy of home, it is a luxurious garment. \n\nCovering the head for both men and women was an important sartorial custom in Western Europe up until 1960s. From a health perspective, head coverings were considered necessary to protect against chills and disease.  In literature and paintings, to be bareheaded often signified emotional distress or even insanity.\n\nThe use of the adjective 'night' in describing various types of informal garments, as in nightcap or nightgown, is sometimes confusing.  It refers to 'night clothes', that is, informal clothing worn in the evening, after the formal public attire of the day, rather than to garments that were actually worn in bed.",
