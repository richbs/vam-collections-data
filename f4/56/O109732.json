They were often given as love presents. This casket is decorated with grotesque creatures, probably based on popular prints, and also with scenes of classical ruins, which were a common sight throughout Italy. Most surviving boxes of this type had pastiglia motifs stuck to a patterned, gilded surface, but on this example they are applied to a ground of crushed glass, which is most rare.",

This was often scented and described in contemporary inventories as <i>pasta di muschio</i> (musk paste). The <i>pastiglia</i> figures and motifs were shaped with a lead mould and then glued to the gilt surface of the box - hence their frequent recurrence on other boxes. The boxes are decorated with legends of Ancient Rome and the scenes copied from woodcuts such as Jacobus Argentoratensis' <i>Triumph of Caesar</i> (Venice, 1504) or illustrations of Livy's <i>Roman History</i>.\n(Label text, circa 2000, from old Medieval & Renaissance Galleries)",
