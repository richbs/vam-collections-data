The individual compositions in the form of idiosyncratic, geometric abstractions frequently incorporate fragments of writing as an essential element of their design. The earthy colours and word fragments evoke a strong sense of place. Typographic titles or captions such as 'Rio Grande' or 'Alaska' which face some of the compositions serve as more explicit guides to their source location and interpretation. African and aboriginal art are clear influences in many of the works. 'Restless' can be 'read' as a kind of elliptical travel diary. \n\nMounted on the inside back cover is a photograph which possibly relates to an incident recounted by the artist that occurred in Botswana. While camping alone, Tremlett was awoken early one morning by a group of guerillas who questioned him at gunpoint and could only be pacified by having their photo taken.\n\nLimited edition of 1000 copies.",
