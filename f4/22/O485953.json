Front fastening coat with three black satin loop-and-knot buttons, and mid-calf length with side slits. Long and wide sleeves with straight cuffs. Plain blue silk lining. \n\nThe main part of the coat is embroidered with flowers: peony, chrysanthemum, prunus blossom, rose, narcissus and pumpkin and very large butterflies. At the bottom of the robe are the earth mountain and scrolling waves amongst which appear peonies, coral, precious jewels and other lucky symbols and flowers. The sleeves are decorated with bands of white satin embroidered with coloured silks and silver thread in satin and pekin knot stitches. \n\nThe design consists of a garden scene with vases of flowers and a man presenting a spray of prunus blossom to a lady. These bands are edged with a woven braid in yellow, blue, green and red. Cuffs and collar edged with black satin embroidered in blue and white with peonies and other flowers and bound with plain black satin.",
