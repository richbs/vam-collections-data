Every year from 1987 to 2006, while David Watkins was Professor of Goldsmithing, Silversmithing, Metalwork and Jewellery at the RCA, he invited four jewellers and silversmiths from outside Britain to give a week-long masterclass. The artists brought diverse skills, aesthetics and approaches. The first call on their time was to interact closely with the students. In addition, although concentrating on their teaching and working in an unfamiliar studio, each artist generously made an object for the RCA's collection. The Royal College of Art Visiting Artists Collection, now transferred to the V&A, is a major document of international contemporary jewellery, a tribute both to the artists and to the vibrancy of the RCA as a teaching institution.\n\nWilliam Harper's sumptuous jewels, with their glowing pools of contrasting colour amid patinated silver and textured gold, show a fascination with the mysterious and the magical. \n\nOver the years he has incorporated found objects from nature and from faraway cultures. He was interested in the cultural references of African, Asian and Central and South American art and in the use of gold in ritual objects. Harper later explored religious themes and symbols questioning the institutions of religion.  \n\nWilliam Harper originally trained as a painter, but soon moved to the enamels which were to become his trademark. In 1973 he published a technical book on enamel titled \u2018Step by Step Enamelling\u2019.",
