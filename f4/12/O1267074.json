The  books contain information about an extensive imaginary monkey world that they created during their school holidays. The books have details about day to day life in monkey society, including political struggles, religious views, schooling and tests, cultural events, and the monkey justice system which featured fines and punishments for bad behaviour. Accompanying the books are the monkeys themselves which were homemade by a live-in teacher who resided with the family while the boys were growing up. \n\n\tThe books and the monkeys give a very unusual insight into the thoughts and concerns of teenage boys in the 1960s. The world they have created is complex in its political and moral structures, showing evidence of wider cultural influences. The books have captured the inner workings of imaginative play, something that is usually intangible and difficult to record, making the objects exciting and important records of modern childhood.",

They record the identity and activities of their toys, providing a detailed account of the workings of the monkey society that the children had created. Monkey life involved things like political struggles, religion, school, tests and honours, entertainment and cultural events, and a justice system with fines and punishments. \nThe monkeys that accompany the books were home-made by Andolie Luck, a live-in teacher who resided with the Reddaway family in the 1960s. They are dressed in a variety of outfits made from different fabrics, some of which could have come from Africa, as Andolie had family living there. They were also donated to the museum.\nThe two brothers both attended boarding school in Cambridge, which meant that when they came home in the holidays the monkeys and books took up the majority of their time.",
