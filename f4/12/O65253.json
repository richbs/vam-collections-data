The building extends from the base of the design up to the top. Near the bottom left corner of the design are three columns on a base with upside down ionic capitals, both at their bases and tops, above which is a scrolling curvilinear shape. \n\nThe main tower of the building extends upwards on the right side of the columns. There is a window-like opening, which is reminiscent of a stained glass rose window, in the tower. There is a semi-circular opening above the tower hovering above two columns with splayed tops like a fan vault. There is a panelled door between the columns. \n\nA pitched roof at the bottom of the design reveals the repeat of the design. It would form the pitched roof of the semi-circular opening in the repeat. An outsize stylised fruiting plant is growing up the side of the building and through the rose window.\n\nThe design is squared up in pencil for cords and dezines, with some numbering in pencil.",

The designs have been subsequently numbered by the Prints, Drawings and Paintings Department, however, a concordance exists.\n\nHistorical significance: The designs collected in the album are, with the exception of some fragmentary medieval examples in Italian collections, the earliest silk designs known to exist.",
