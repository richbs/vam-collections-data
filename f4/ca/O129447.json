            "public_access_description": "This batik dyed silk panel shows an unnamed Trinidadian woman in bold profile. The artist, Alice M. Pashley, went on to become a founding member of  The Art Society of Trinidad and Tobago, which was set up in 1943.  The Art Society of Trinidad and Tobago was inspired by contemporary European art movements and their fascination with art from around the world but felt that art should reflect local subjects and themes.  These concerns are demonstrated in this piece.\n\nThis portrait is believed to be of the artist's servant, and was made at a time of social and racial discord in the West Indies.  Pashley's use of batik shows an interest in the wider art world and a knowledge of European trends in art. Originally developed in Indonesia, where she had studied it, the technique of batik became fashionable in Europe, America and West Africa in the early part of the twentieth century when this portrait was made.",
