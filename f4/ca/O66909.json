Daniel prophesied the birth of Christ: \u2018Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son\u2019. \n\nThe panel would have accompanied a scene from the New Testament related to this prophecy, such as the Annunciation to the Virgin Mary or the Nativity (birth) of Christ.",

So they were thought of as the deliverers of His messages concerning the future including the Coming of the Messiah. The major prophets are Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and Daniel.\n\nThese prophet panels are also known as 'messenger panels' because they convey these divinely inspired prophecies or messages. In this panel we see on the scroll 'Puer Natus Est Nobis' ('a child is born to us'). Daniel prophesied the birth of Christ: 'Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son'. \n\nThe panel would have been accompanying a scene from the New Testament related to this prophecy such as the Annunciation to the Virgin or the Nativity of Christ.",
