Reynolds (Lugt 2364); Dyce Bequest 1869 LITERATURE <i>Dyce Catalogue</i> no. 244 (as by Tintoretto); Tietze and Tietze-Conrat, no. 1843 and pl. 127/1 (as Tintoretto school) The recto is a study for the Scourging of Christ in the Haussmann Collection, Berlin (1931). The picture is published as Tintoretto by Herman Voss in an article on Dr Fritz Haussmann\u2019s Collection in Zeitschrift f\u00fcr blidende K\u00fcnste, 65, 1931-32, p. 163. Tietze and Tietze-Conrat, who pointed out the connection of the drawing with the picture, ascribe both to the Tintoretto studio. The head and arms of the figure on the verso are so sketchily drawn that it is hard to say exactly what the artist intended; but the figure seems to belong to a group of drawings that were probably made from a piece of sculpture representing a man bowed own by a physical or mental burden, possibly Atlas. There is, as Dr Liebman has shown, a 16th century bronze of such a figure in the Pushkin Museum, Moscow. It represents a bent old man with saggin knees, leaning a stick, with his left hand above his head. (M. J. Liebman in Soobscheniya Akademiya Nauk Institut Istorii Iskusstv, nos. 13 and 14, Moscow, 1960). This bronze, or another piece of sculpture was probably Tintoretto\u2019s model. Some of the other drawings made from it are discussed and illustrated by Dr Liebman, as well as in Hadeln, Tintoretto, p. 27 and I. Feny\u00f6, North Italian drawings from the collection of the Budapest Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest, 1965, pp.80-2.",
