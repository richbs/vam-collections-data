Not only did the increasing layers of underclothes sit well with prevailing notions of modesty, it was realised that efficient use of underclothing could save a good deal of cleaning of the outer clothes:\n\nEvery moisture or impurity, should be instantly removed, and as those parts of the dress which are next to the skin are constantly imbibing perspirable matter, they should be changed frequently.  Indeed, the same clothes ought never to be kept on for many days together.  Away with finery; but take care that the child is always clean and dry.\"\n(The New Female Instructor, 1834)",
