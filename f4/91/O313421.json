In 1875 he won the Prix de Rome for engraving and, supported by his more conservative mentor, Jules-Cl\u00e9ment Chaplain, was elected to the Institut de France in 1888. In 1889 he won the Grand Prix at the Paris Exposition Universelle and was appointed an officer of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur. In 1907 he was awarded the Salon medal of honour for sculpture, an unprecedented award for a medallist.\n\nRoty's great career reflected his role in what Roger Marx called 'the Renaissance of the medal in France'. This was evident at the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1900, where struck medals by Roty and other medallists sold in tens of thousands.\n\nRoty and Chaplain were two of the greatest late 19th century medallists. They adopted an approach which integrated the subject, field and lettering into a single, unified composition. This French innovation had a wide-reaching influence throughout Europe at the turn of the century.",
