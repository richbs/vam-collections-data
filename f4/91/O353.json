ISBN 1851773088.\nShown at the Paris Exposition Universelle in 1900, this elegant vase was purchased from Gall\u00e9 by the Museum itself, rather than as part of the controversial Donaldson gift (see cats. 165-166). The vase's decoration of stylized chrysanthemums is characteristic of Gall\u00e9's introspective and slightly morbid symbolism; he would have been well aware of the chrysanthemum's Japanese significance as an imperial flower as well as the flower's French association with funerals and death. A serious student of both science and art, Gall\u00e9 was familiar with Chinese glass and hard stones, which he studied at the South Kensington Museum when he was in London for the international exhibition of 1871; thirteen years later in Berlin he saw the Brandt collection of Chinese glass, as well as Islamic glass. From the 1880s, he developed a passion for Japanese lacquer and prints; like many other late-nineteenth-century French artists, he adopted a style that came to be called Japonisme, perhaps the single most significant precursor of Art Nouveau.\nSpending only \u00a3258 19s. from its own funds, the Museum's choice of objects from the 1900 exhibition was more conservative than those chosen by Donaldson. From that perspective, this vase (purchased for \u00a37 19s. 6d.) fits within the established \"Japanese\" style. Part of the \"New Art\" collection exhibited in Birmingham, Edinburgh, and Dublin following its first, contentious showing in the Museum, the vase apparently remained in storage until 1971.\n\nLit.
