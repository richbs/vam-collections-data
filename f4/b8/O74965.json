It is of tulle stretched over taffeta and mounted on a firmly boned foundation. Springing from the lowered waist is a frou-frou skirt of accordion-pleated triple flounces in frail tulle edged with shining satin ribbon. At the sides additional fullness is achived by tiers of enormous rosettes of pleated tulle interleaved with supporting ruches of nylon crin. \nPierre Balmain (1914-1982) opened his salon in 1945. Having studied architecture he worked on the structure of garments, defining the body with simple, modern lines. This cocktail dress, designed for the increasing elegant youth of the late 1950s is  inspired by ballet and Spanish flamenco dress. It epitomises Balmain's harmonious balance between extravagance and elegance.",
