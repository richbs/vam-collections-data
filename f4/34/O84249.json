Mirman, who referred to her hats as \u2018objects d\u2019art\u2019, worked first from an attic before opening her couture millinery salon in London. She made hats for Princess Margaret from 1953 and the Queen and the Queen Mother from the 1960s. \n\nWith typical aplomb, Simone Mirman scattered diminutive rosebuds over this coolie-style summer hat. In 1953, the year in which this hat was made, the nation celebrated the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, and the millinery trade enjoyed an upsurge in business and profits.",
