Designed as a moment rather than simply an object, the cauldron provided a memorable climax  to the ceremony. 204 individually sculpted copper \u2018petals\u2019, each representing a participating  country, were brought into the stadium during the athletes\u2019 parade. Assembled into a radiating  pattern at the heart of the growing crowd of athletes, these precious objects were each ignited by  the Olympic torch. Watched by 90,000 people in the stadium, and an estimated global TV  audience of 900 million, these petals were carried upwards on stems in concentric waves,  converging to reveal a cauldron form with a unified flame.\nThe cauldron \u2018moment\u2019 provided an image which has proven to be one of the most significant,  lasting memories of a bold opening ceremony which itself was both critically well-received and  captured the public\u2019s imagination. The Olympic Cauldron won Product Design of the Year at the  2012 Icon Magazine Awards, and was shortlisted for the Design Museum\u2019s  Designs of the Year 2013.\nThis model is an exact scale replica of the Olympic cauldron. It was created by the Heatherwick Studio workshop for the V&A exhibition,  \u2018Heatherwick Studio: Designing The Extraordinary\u2019. \n\nThomas Heatherwick is one of the most important creative practitioners working in the UK today.  He has been a recipient of the Prince Philip Designers Prize and the London Design Medal, and  in 2004 became the youngest practitioner to be appointed a Royal Designer for Industry. At the  heart of his Studio\u2019s practice is a profound commitment to elegant, integrated design solutions  and the absolute dedication to materials research, prototyping, industrial collaboration, tactility,  texture \u2013 and above all, extraordinary form-making.\nHaving completed his MA at the Royal College of Art, Heatherwick established his Studio in  1994. Rejecting conventional classifications, his team explore the thresholds between standard  design categories. Celebrating the pure joy of creating 3-dimensional forms, the Heatherwick  Studio has earned an international reputation for creating works that span a breathtaking array of  disciplines: from architecture, furniture, product design and fashion, to engineering, sculpture,  transport and urban planning. The team\u2019s work to date includes a spinning chair, a rolling  bridge, an expandable zip bag, a power station, an \u2018endless\u2019 bench and a brand new bus for  London.",
