Some micromosaics contain more than 5000 pieces per square inch. The earliest attempts at micromosaic revealed visible joins between the pieces (known as tesserae) and a lack of perspective. Later artists such as Antonio Aguatti made huge advances in micromosaic technique, resulting in renderings that were truer to life. Glass micromosaic technique developed in the 18th century, in the Vatican Mosaic Workshop in Rome, where they still undertake restoration work today. \n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",

Phillips, London, 1976.\n\nHistorical significance: The Roman firm of Castellani introduced historicising styles in micromosaics in the second half of the nineteenth century.  Castellani used traditional glass mosaics whereas this set is composed of <i>smalti</i> tesserae.Smalti means enamel. An opaque vitreous substance, it is made by heating a matrix of Venetian glass to a high temperature and mixing in micro crystals of opaque materials and pigments. It is poured in to cake shapes and cooled for use as mosaic tesserae. The exact Vatican formula is secret. The process was developed by Allesio Mattioli, a chemist, who was in charge of tesserae production in the Vatican Mosaic Studio from 1730-50.",
