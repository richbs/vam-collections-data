This watercolour is set in the Lake District of north-west England. Visits to the region increased greatly after the artist William Gilpin (1724-1804) published a book describing the picturesque landscape.\n\nThomas Rowlandson (1756-1827) made several watercolour drawings to illustrate a verse by William Combe (1741-1823). The verse was intended as a satire on Gilpin and his readers.",

It may not be generally known at the present time that the tours were written to elucidate the designs, which the following introduction fully explains. \n\u201cThis second tour is, like the former one, a work of suggestions from the plates by Mr. Rowlandson, though not with such entire reserve as the first. Some few of the subjects may have been influenced by hints from me; and I am willing to suppose that such are the least amusing of them.\u201d \u2013 Introduction to the second volume, 1820. \n<i>Width,</i> 8 3/12 <i>inches.

SYNTAX thrown off his horse while hunting.  807 \n\u201cYour sport, my lord, I cannot take, \nFor I must go and hunt a lake.\" - Vol. i. p. 108. \n\nMr. Combe no doubt thought it as well, although availing himself of the hint that hunting was not suited to the Doctor's taste, to mention the fact of the Doctor being asked to join the sport, and his declining the invitation as he was about to make some drawings on the lake. \n<i>Width,</i> 7 1/12 <i>inches.

SYNTAX leading a lady to the entrance of a grand mansion: most probably giving the idea of the Doctor escorting Lady Bounty from the garden to her mansion on their first interview. 808 \n\u201cFor while he sojourns he will be \nThe object of all courtesy.\u201d - Vol. ii. p. 217. \n<i>Width,</i> 9 4/12 <i>inches.

Height, </i>5 1/12 <i>inches.</i> \n\nDR. SYNTAX frightened by the appearance of a large fish having a form resembling that of a whale; his companion and some fishwives are also greatly alarmed, and a few of them lie sprawling on the ground.  812 \n<i>Width,</i> 8 2/12 <i>inches.

Height, </i>5 1/12 <i>inches.</i> \n\nDR. SYNTAX gently opens the door of a garret, and is horrified to find a woman of the pav\u00e9 reclining back in her chair dead; a dog is seen on the left playing with her wig.  817 \n<i>Width,</i> 8 2/12 <i>inches.
