Here the silversmith has embellished the surface with chased decoration, using special tools to model the surface without removing any metal.

They were usually circular, oval or boat-shaped with an everted (turned-out) rim and a high, arched, bail handle. The handle was sometimes fixed but more often hinged, as in this example. The sides were decorated by piercing or die stamping or a combination of both techniques. The basket usually rested on a supporting rim with similar decoration.",
