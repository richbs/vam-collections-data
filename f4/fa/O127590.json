In the first examples the roll top consisted of battens fixed next to each other on a canvas backing, allowing the panel to slide away flat when the top was opened. The rigid roll-top form seen in this piece was a later development, which again appears to have first appeared in France. It was adopted in Britain in the 1780s. \n\nThis form, combining a desk with a glazed superstructure containing shelves, was known as a 'bureau bookcase'. Pieces of this type were generally used in bedrooms, and some examples had a cupboard underneath the desk for storing clothes.",
