A block of compressed powdered snuff would have been kept in the smaller one, while the larger compartment, fitted with a perforated grater, would have held the grated snuff powder. The tightly closing lid is essential for keeping snuff dry. Loose powdered snuff was usually kept in a hinged box with a single compartment. In the home snuff was kept in bottles and jars.\n\n Source\nFrom the 1620s tobacco was usually imported to England from the North American Colonies, especially Virginia. The spices came from the East Indies, imported by the Dutch and English East India Companies.\n\nOwnership & Use\nA block of compressed powdered snuff would be grated into a fine powder, which was pinched between the fingers and inhaled. Originally used for medicinal purposes, snuff-taking became fully established as a pleasurable, social custom by 1700. It was taken primarily by men, and throughout the 18th century, increasingly, by women. This lid is engraved with the monogram 'HE' for the Edmonds family of Yorkshire, and with the family crest of a three-masted ship in full sail.",
