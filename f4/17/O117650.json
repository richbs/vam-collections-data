Born into a Jewish family in Frankfurt, she initially pursued an academic career before moving to Paris in 1930 to concentrate on photography.\n\nThis photograph was taken during a trip to New York organised by the author Hendrik Willem Van Loon, who supported Bing and facilitated a solo show at the June Rhodes Gallery in 1936. Bing was well received and met the photographer Alfred Stieglitz (1864-1946), who introduced \u2018a new world\u2019 to her. The unusual modernist perspective and apparently randomly grouped subjects is typical of Bing\u2019s work of this period. The flag looks deflated in the still air, apportioned no more importance than the bare tree or the stark white washing in the background.",
