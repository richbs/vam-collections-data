In 1812, at the age of nineteen, he wrote to his eldest brother William that he wanted to 'throw my mind back as far as possible, to the bright eras of Greece and Rome'; at the same time, he hoped for a gift from his father of a print of Trajan's Column.  He lived in Rome between 1816 and 1830, and although he painted some genre scenes set in Italy, his aspirations were more for the Grand Manner. In the year he painted this picture, Eastlake wrote to his mother that he was attempting 'a union of History and Landscape'. The Emperor Trajan (AD 53-117) had built a new forum in Rome, now ruined apart from the famous Trajan's Column which is seen on the right of the painting.  For the British, with its own expanding empire, ancient Rome held a fascination both intellectual and emotional.  The principal contemporary spokesperson was Byron, who glorified the ancient world and mourned its demise. Eastlake's painting has the same Romantic synthesis of admiration and nostalgic regret for the 'glory that was Greece and the grandeur that was Rome'.",

Oil painting was a favoured as it was a more durable medium than watercolour painting. It was also more expensive and time-consuming than watercolour.\n\nPeople\nThis painting was made by Charles Lock Eastlake (1793-1865), who lived in Rome periodically between 1816 and 1830.  He had studied architecture, and in Rome he recorded many of the city's ancient ruins.  A private collector, following the example established by John Sheepshanks, donated it to the Museum.\n\nTime\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, collecting pictures of Roman and Greek antiquities was a popular pursuit for wealthy and educated people. It had become fashionable in Britain after the discovery of ancient classical ruins in Italy and Greece, such as Pompeii and Herculaneum, and was encouraged by the widespread study of Latin and Greek.\n\nPlaces\nOne of the most famous places in Rome was the Forum of Trajan, which is depicted in this painting of 1821. This structure was built by the Emperor Trajan (BCE 53-117) and is best known for the tall column ('Trajan's Column') visible on the right of the scene.",

Elected ARA 1827, RA 1830. Also pursued a distinguished administrative career, notably after election to PRA 1850, and his directorship of the NG 1855-65. Several publications, notably <i>Materials for the History of Oil-painting</i> (1847), and translations of German art treatises.
