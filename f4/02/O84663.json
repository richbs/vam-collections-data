            "history_note": "Once thought to be an early example of Netherlandish Maiolica, recent research has identified this vase as originating from Italy. During the last quarter of the fifteenth century, Italian galleys from Genoa and Venice exported novelty-luxury wares in ceramic and glass to Northern Europe including England, where they found their way to the courts and other wealthy patrons. Such rare imports were treasured possessions and vessels of similar shape and decoration, often containing flowers and peacock feathers, are depicted in various contemporary sources including the Book of Hours of Engelbert of Nassau of 1477-90. \n\nThe vase is said to have been excavated in the City of London. It's original foot is missing and the modern replacement was based on a vase of almost identical size and shape, and with identical tournament shield and arms, which was excavated from the moat of the Tower of London. The arms and the archaeological provenance of this second vase suggest a courtly provenance for the two vases. The fact that both show an unusual version of the English Royal coat of arms, in which the conventional quarterings are reversed and featuring slightly different beasts, could be explained by misinterpretation by the Italian potters.\n\nPROV. William Ridout Collection, London and Toronto; acquired in 1938. Said to have been found in Mark Lane, City of London.\n\nHistorical significance: Stylistically this vase is close to the wares produced at Pesaro in the Marches, but chemical analyses of the ceramic bodies has indicated that the vases have most likely been made in Tuscany.",
