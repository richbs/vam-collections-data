Beene became particularly famous for his highly-constructed \"architectural\" dresses but during the late 1960s he also turned to popular culture for inspiration, introducing touches of whimsy into his designs. His particular talent lay in creating that successfully responded to the era in which it was worn - youthful styles in the 1960s and loose, fluid, body-freeing clothing in the 70s. Having achieved financial and artistic success by the end of the 1970s he finally had the creative freedom he desired and devoted the remainder of his career to the search for the perfect fabric, perfect seam and perfect cut. \n\nThe garments Beene showed in 1970 were a departure from the \"architectural\" dresses he was known for in the previous decade. His new designs were softly draped, made of flowing fabrics that subtly revealed the body beneath. This pair of black evening pyjamas, given to the Museum by a former Geoffrey Beene model, is an example of this departure from the heavy brocaded fabrics of his earlier structured style.",
