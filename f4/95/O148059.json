The term is a French mishearing of the Turkish word 'odalik' or domestic slave.  Prurient curiosity (tinged with male envy) about the domestic arrangements of Muslims seems to have given rise to a large genre of fantasy pictures made to satisfy Europeans as to what Eastern women looked like, or in fact how European males imagined they might look. \nPhilippoteaux was mainly a skillful painter of military subjects and portraits, a panorama painter and also an engraver and illustrator. The Duke of Wellington owned one of his paintings of the battle of Waterloo. The artist had provided illustrations for a book about Algeria, and this may have influenced him to produce images similar to the one shown here.",
