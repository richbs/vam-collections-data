It shows the remarkable technical skill of his mature style. Redout\u00e9 has exploited the characteristic transparency of the watercolour medium to convey the transparent wings of the dragonfly. He has taken advantage of the smooth, polished surface of the vellum to capture the delicate sheen of the petals.\n\nRedout\u00e9 was one of the greatest botanical artists of the 18th century. He produced many illustrations for botanical monographs and scientific publications. He also made decorative studies for books that were devoted to the beauty of garden flowers.",
