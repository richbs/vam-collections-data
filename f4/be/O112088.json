            "public_access_description": "When Wright designed this chair, metal furniture was in its infancy, and restricted mainly to filing cabinets and cupboards. This chair was designed for the administrative building of a mail order soap company in Buffalo, New York State.  Part of a range of metal chairs, desks and combination seat/desk units, its rectilinear geometry and innovative design were characteristic of the building itself.  This followed Wright\u2019s view that \u2018It is quite impossible to consider the building as one thing and its furnishings as another\u2019.",
