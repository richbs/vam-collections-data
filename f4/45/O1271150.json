Based in Delhi, they launched their label in 1992 and began primarily as an export business. Rising consumer affluence in India made them refocus their attention on the Indian market in 2007. Their first fashion ramp show was for the Autumn/Winter 2010/11 season and this sari is one of the pieces from that important collection. The concept for the show was to explore how urban women in India could wear fashionable yet traditional Indian garments as an alternative to western garments. The collection included saris and salwar kameez in simple cuts and minimal colours. This minimal black and white sari has a rickshaw design on the pallou (the section of the sari that falls over the shoulder) and is hand woven using a weft inlay jamdani technique. The sari is teamed with a fitted blouse on which there are appliqu\u00e9d a number of miniature symbols of everyday life such as bicycles, lamps, umbrellas and mobile phones. A thin belt is worn over the sari to give a slim silhouette. The ensemble conveys a simple contemporary urban aesthetic.",
