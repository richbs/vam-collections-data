It shall be thy task\nTo keep the newly kindled fire alight;\nTo know the earth, the sea, the stars above;\nHold happiness; seek beauty; follow right;\nOffer a friendly hand to all who ask.\nAnd, day by day,\nLead sister feet along the golden way -\nThe road that leads to work and health and love.",
