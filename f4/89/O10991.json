The military trophies and emerging lions reflect the status and education of the young heir to the throne.  The portrait is a contemporary copy from a large group showing  Frederick, Prince of Wales and his family.\n\nPeople\nThis portrait may have been presented to Thomas Osborne, 4th Duke of Leeds (1713-1789) by George III. It hung in the Dining Room at Hornby Castle, Yorkshire until 1930. The frame is attributed to the London workshop of  Paul Petit (active 1724-1757), based in the parish of St. James's, Piccadilly, and may have been carved by his assistant Henry Jouret. Petit was of Huguenot descent, and worked both as a carver and gilder. He also supplied elaborate picture frames for portraits at Warwick Castle, where they can still be seen today.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThis frame was one of a pair which hung in the Dining Room at Hornby Castle, North Yorkshire. The elaborate carving was designed by the craftsman, probably in consultation with the portrait painter. The carving is enhanced by the water gilding (a method in which gold leaf is applied to a damp gesso surface), with its highly burnished raised surfaces contrasting with the duller backgrounds.",

Painted in London.\n\nHistorical significance: Amongst the most elaborate pieces of high rococo frame carving known in England; this frame retains most of its original gilding. It can be attributed to Paul Petit, a carver and gilder who worked for Frederick, Prince of Wales from 1732 to 1749.  Paul Petit's assistant Henry Jouret continued on his own account  until at least 1760 and it is possible that this frame was carved by Jouret rather than Petit himself.",
