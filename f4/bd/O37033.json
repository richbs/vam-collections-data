The swans are of two sheets of card stuck together and the suspending nylon thread is glued between the two layers.  Each swan has a duckling suspended by thread from its beak.  The black swan has a yellow one and the white swans a red and a blue one.  The swans and ducklings are in silhouette and the eyes are denoted by being cut out.  \nThe main suspending threads are attached to wire arcs which in turn are attached to one main thread of grey nylon wound round a card.\nThe mobile is held in place in the packet by a red backing card which has slits to hold the threads and cut out tabs to hold the swans.\n2.  pack contains a mobile mounted for presentation on red card\n3.  explanation and descriptive sheet\n4.  leaflet detailing in English the range of Flensted Mobiles.\n\n*Mobiles became important as toys appropriate to a baby's first few months during the early 1960s.  Alexander Calder had introduced his moving sculptures called mobiles in the 1930s.  As these became well known in the 1940s, they were copied in schools and art colleges and the 1950s saw a number of publications on how to create your own mobiles.  They seem to have been available as toys from the late 1950s.",
