The two children ( aged 10 and 12 ) described by the Bootle Times as \"marvellous \" were given medals for their \" daring and clever performances on the trapeze\" . They were performing with Elphinstone's Circus in Bootle from December 1890 to April 1891. E. Paddock may have been the manager of the Circus. The family name was Munday but Fitzroy, Fred's middle name became his professional name.  His sister used the name Miss Adeline Patty. Her family name was Adeline Martha Munday. \n\n The V&A was given a small collection of medals awarded to Fred Fitzroy and a photograph of him aged about 12 is in the Theatre Museum. The medal itself was mass produced by a manufacturer in Birmingham and then probably commissioned from a local jeweller in Bootle. It was specially engraved to present to Fred ( and presumably an identical medal for his sister) in recognition of their outstanding performance.",
