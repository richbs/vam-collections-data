Gollermaschen, or collar pendants, were hung from the collar chains used to keep in place the detachable white linen collar which was part of traditional dress in the region.  It is more likely to be a Brustkettenhalter, or breast chain clasp.  This was worn on the bodice, where it secured the end of the silver chain which crisscrossed the front of the bodice, holding it tightly laced like a corset. The delicate pierced silver tracery over a polished or gilded back plate is typical of traditional jewellery from the Ulm area in the second half of the 18th century.  \n\nIt was bought for \u00a31 10s. 4d. at the International Exhibition, London, 1872.",
