The design has been dyed onto the ground using a resist and indigo, with a facing of bias-cut plain weave silk, a backing of plain weave glazed cotton and traces of bronze coloured felt which could be the remains of an original woollen backing or the remains of an interlining which has become felted.\nThe ground fabric has been pieced, cut and rejoined so that the design is disrupted. The ground is black and the pattern originally consisted of a red quatrefoil device in the centre outlined in white, with blue and red; around which are rectangular red blocks and large yellow and red lozenges symmetrically arranged.  These forms are filled with  stylized floral and geometric motifs.  There is one red palmette along each end. There is a border in which a swastika within an octagon alternates with  pointed cartouches.\nEmbroidery threads: 2S silk; black, white, yellow, yellow faded to beige, blue varying in shade from mid- to light, green and red.\nFacing: dark blue silk.\nBacking: green glazed cotton.",
