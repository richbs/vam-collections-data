The figure wears a coronet (karanda makuta); a waistcloth with girdle; a sacred cord; waistband; a broad necklace; keyura armlets; and padasasras on the feet.   At the back of the head he is depicted with human-type hair hanging down in long tresses.  The figure stands on a circular lotus-pedestal with uprights for the support of an arched surround.\nThe Chola origin of this figure is indicated by the comparatively smooth features, projecting ears, low coronet, the simplicity of ornament, and the comparative absence of chasing.",

He would accompany his parents in temple parades, borne on a separate palanquin. The figure stands on a circular lotus-pedestal with uprights for the support of an arched surround (\u2018prabha\u2019). \n\nThis sculpture is a good example of the masterful casting techniques of the Chola period (about 850-1267 AD).  It illustrates the metalworkers\u2019 use of subtle form, simple ornament and restrained surface decoration, with minimal chased detail.\n\nHere Ganesha stands in a relaxed posture, his hip flexed. In this four-armed form, his upper hands hold the noose (\u2018pasa\u2019) and elephant-goad (\u2018ankusa\u2019). His lower left hand displays one of the delicacies enjoyed by Ganesha, variously identified as wood-apple (\u2018kapittha\u2019) or sweetmeats, which he is about to take in his trunk. \n\nThe fourth hand holds his broken tusk. This too is explained in a variety of anecdotal stories, but its origins may lie in its resemblance to the plough to evoke his early role as a patron of agrarian activity. This role appears to have been displaced in the later medieval period by other functions, notably to serve as the patron and protector of those embarking on new ventures.",
