An unusual performance for a travelling circus, this kind of spectacle was the secret to Carmo's success. \n\nAn Australian-born magician and juggler, whose real name was Henry Cameron, Carmo began his career as a strong man before moving to England and entering the world of magic. He began his own circus in the 1920s, where he presented spectacular illusions to complement the main show of animal and circus acts. The circus was destroyed by fire shortly before World War II.",
