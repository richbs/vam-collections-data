The eponymous heroine is an example of a fallen woman: once a royal mistress, she is later abandoned, betrayed and reduced to destitution. She is finally rescued by her husband, who has served her in disguise, and she dies in peace having been granted his forgiveness. The play is based on real historical events: Jane Shore, a famous beauty, was mistress to Edward IV. Though he follows quite closely the events of her life, Rowe amends the story to emphasize repentance and forgiveness. The real Jane died obscure and in poverty without a romantic reconciliation to console her.  Sarah Siddons, one of the great tragic actresses of the age, was much admired in this role. She is seen here desperate and degraded in an attitude of penitence. It was said that her affecting performances often caused members of the audience to faint with emotion.",
