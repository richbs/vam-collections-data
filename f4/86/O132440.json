Jan van den Hoecke (bapt. 1611-1651) was a Flemish painter who also worked in Italy and Austria, and was a pupil of Rubens. One of his earliest works from his Antwerp period include the oil sketch of the Triumph of David (Kimbell Art Museum,TX) which relates both stylistically and compositionally to 1341-1869.  van den Hoecke left Antwerp for Rome by 1637 and remained there until 1644. In Rome he was clearly influenced by the paintings of Guido Reni as well as by antique sources.  However, after leaving Italy, he gradually modified his style, adopting more closely Rubens\u2019s approach of ca. 1610\u201320 rather than the master\u2019s picturesque virtuoso late style. van den Hoecke's success appears to have been greatly due to his ability to adapt the classicizing trends of Italian Seicento painting to the style he had learnt in the Antwerp studio of Rubens.",

London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, pp. 249-251, cat. no. 309.\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\nSir Peter Paul RUBENS (1577-1640) \nFlemish (Antwerp) School \nBorn in Siegen, Westphalia, of an Antwerp family, Rubens moved to Antwerp in 1587 where, after leaving school, he became a pupil of Adam van Noort and Otto van Veen. From 1600-08 he lived in Italy, entering the service of Vincenzo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua, on whose behalf he visited Spain in 1603. He returned to Antwerp in 1608 and was appointed painter to the Brussels Court of the Archduke Albert in the following year. He was commissioned by Marie de M\u00e9dicis to execute a series of paintings for the Luxembourg and accordingly visited Paris in 1622 and 1625. His activities as a diplomat took him to Spain in 1628 and to London in 1629-30, when he was knighted by Charles I. Having returned to Antwerp in 1630, he carried out the paintings for the ceiling of the Whitehall Banqueting House in the succeeding year. He died in 1640, renowned as a courtier and diplomat as well as a painter. \n\n\nFollower of Peter Paul RUBENS \n\n309\nTHE TRIUMPH OF SAUL: A SKETCH \nPencil and oil on oak panel \n23 1/8  X 33 3/4 (58.7 X 85.7) \nTownshend Bequest \n1341-1869\n\nSaul is riding in a chariot; he is preceded by David, on foot, carrying the head of Goliath. Although it was praised by Waagen ('one of the most spirited specimens of the master') and accepted by Rooses, this painting is no longer acceptable as a work by Rubens. It is, in all likelihood, by an immediate follower, and Julius S. Held has suggested an attribution to Abraham van Diepenbeck (1596-1675). There is a drawing of this subject by van Diepenbeck in the Louvre (F. Lugt, <i>Inventaire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des dessins des \u00c9coles du Nord, \u00c9cole flamande</i>, i, 1949, no. 554), but this does not appear to be related to this painting. \nIconographically, 1341-1869 is similar to the Tempesta engraving of this subject (Bartsch, xvii, 130.252), though this differs in showing David on horseback, and to related paintings such as that by Frans Francken II in the Hermitage, Leningrad (no. 503).\n \nCondition. The panel is split horizontally, but otherwise in good condition. Cleaning in 1967 revealed <i>pentimenti</i> under Saul's left arm. \nProv. The Rev. C. H. Townshend before 1857; bequeathed to the Museum in 1868. \nLit. Waagen, <i>Supplement</i>, 1857, p. 180; M.

This sketch, which is painted on wood, about 2 ft. 4 in. high, by 3 ft. wide, is one of the most spirited specimens of the master. Judging from the style of representation and from the character of the spirited horses, I should adjudge it to the period of the celebrated fight with the Amazons in the Gallery at Munich.  \n\nGustav Waagen\"\nMax Rooses, <u>L'\u0153uvre de P.

Chauncy Hare Townshend, 1868\n'Chauncy Hare Townshend  (1798-1868)  was born into a wealthy family, only son of Henry Hare Townsend of Busbridge Hall, Godalming, Surrey.  Educated at Eton and Trinity Hall, Cambridge (BA 1821).  Succeeded to the family estates 1827, when he added 'h' to the Townsend name.  He had taken holy orders, but while he always referred to himself as 'Rev.' on the title pages of his books, he never practised his vocation... . Very much a dilettante in the eighteenth-century sense, he moved in the highest social and literary circles; a great friend of Charles Dickens (he was the dedicatee of <u>Great Expectations</u>) with whom he shared a fascination of mesmerism...  Bulwer Lytton described his life's 'Beau-deal of happiness' as 'elegant rest, travel, lots of money - and he is always ill and melancholy'.  Of the many watercolours and British and continental oil paintings he bequeathed to the V&A, the majority are landscapes.  He is the first identifiable British collector of early photographs apart from the Prince Consort, particularly landscape photography, and also collected gems and geological specimens.'\n\nRef : Parkinson, Ronald, <u>Catalogue of British Oil Paintings 1820-1860</U>.

He may have received his first training with his father, Caspar van den Hoecke ( fl 1595\u20131648) but later became a pupil of Rubens. One of his earliest works from his Antwerp period include the oil sketch of the <i>Triumph of David</i> (Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth, TX, Inv. AP 1966.03) which relates both stylistically and compositionally to 1341-1869. van den Hoecke left Antwerp for Rome by 1637 and remained there until 1644. In Rome he was clearly influenced by the paintings of Guido Reni as well as by antique sources. He next entered the service of Archduke Leopold William, first at the imperial court at Vienna and later in Brussels.  However, after leaving Italy, he gradually modified his style, adopting more closely Rubens\u2019s approach of c. 1610\u201320 rather than the master\u2019s picturesque virtuoso late style. His success appears to have been greatly due to his ability to adapt the classicizing trends of Italian Seicento painting to the style he had learnt in the Antwerp studio of Rubens. There is a very similar drawing, <i>The triumphal return of David, vanquisher of Goliath</i> attributed to Abraham van Diepenbeck (1596-1675) in the Louvre (inv. 19897).",
