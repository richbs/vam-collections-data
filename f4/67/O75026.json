            "public_access_description": "This miniature painting is one of a group of 17th-century unfinished miniatures on tablets of vellum originally interleaved into the blank pages of a leather-bound book traditionally called \u2018Samuel Cooper's Pocket Book\u2019. This book was acquired by the V&A in 1892, when all the works were believed to be by Samuel Cooper. It is now agreed that four are by Cooper and the other ten, except one, are by Susannah Penelope Rosse. It is possible that this \u2018Pocket Book\u2019 actually belonged to Susannah Rosse and her husband, Michael Rosse, a wealthy jeweller. Susannah was the daughter of Cooper's fellow miniaturist, Richard Gibson. She grew up in London only a few streets from Cooper and, as a married woman, lived in Cooper's former house on Henrietta Street, Covent Garden. She was a great admirer of Cooper. The sale of Michael Rosse's collection of art in 1723, over 20 years after Susannah Rosse 's death, included original works by Cooper and also acknowledged copies of Cooper by Mrs Rosse. Examples of Cooper's unfinished works would have allowed Susannah Rosse to study closely Cooper's technique. This portrait is inscribed on the back \u2018Mrs Rosse\u2019 and is almost certainly a self-portrait. The other works by her in the group are a remarkably intimate record of relations and also of neighbours on Henrietta Street.",

No. 143) and perhaps in the Michael Rosse sale, 2 April 1723; eventually purchased by Edwin [Durning] Lawrence  before 1862, and sold by him to the Museum for \u00a3525 in 1892.]\n\n<b>Exhibited:</b> As for Cat. No. 88. [South Kensington 1862, no. 2531 (the set as Cooper); BFAC 1889, p. 133, case XLI, nos 1-15 (Cooper);  V&amp;A 1983, unnumbered.]\n\n<b>Literature:</b> As for Cat.

No. 138, this is presumably a self-portrait, but taken five or so years later, in about 1685-90. Reynolds's dating of 1690-5, which overrides Madeleine Ginsburg's advice (1) is somewhat late, both on the perceived difference in SusannahPenelope's appearance and on her costume and the neatly pinned hair in the present miniature. Ginsburg compares the light cloth head-dress with that in a 'portrait of Mme de Maintenon by Pierre Mignard (N Mitford, <i>The Sun-King</i>, 1969, pl. facing p. 113) which ... would seem to be the portrait of her \"en Sainte Fransoise Romaine\" painted presumably after her marriage in 1684 ... [therefore] perhaps c.1690?' \n\n1 Minute of December 1974, departmental files.\u201d",
