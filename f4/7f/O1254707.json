He is a teddy bear who travels the world, meeting people and discovering more about the planet. He appears as a puppet for use in the classroom, in books and DVDs and in a BBC series. \nA bear is suitable for accompanying children round the world, being both exotic and familiar, and a common travelling companion for young children. The shared use of a single character around the country has also enabled the development of networks and partnerships between schools, and global geocaching projects have also grown up arouund Barnaby Bear.\nBarnaby is interesting as a character developed with a primarily educational function, and demonstrates a successful partnership between a national organisation, schools, and the media.",
