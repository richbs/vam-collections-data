A country landscape of trees and hills is visible behind the two central dancers with a further male dancer on the far left, dressed in a short jacket with high waisted tight fitting breeches and a wide yellow waistband. He also wears a wide brimmed black hat. On the far right is a female dancer dressed in a wide skirted dress which finishes just below the knee. The front lacing fitted bodice of this dress is a deep pink as are her delicate ballet shorts and the wide bands of decoration at the hem of her skirt. The central female figure is dressed in a lavishly decorated outfit of white and pale yellow. Her dress, with its capped sleeves, is largely concealed beneath the ornate white lace shawl the dancer wears wrapped over her head. In her right hand she is holding the edge of her wide skirt which is formed of two layers of a patterned white fabric and has a scalloped hem trimmed with pale yellow. She wears a plain gold bracelet on both wrists and pale yellow ballet shoes. Her male companion is dressed in much darker tones. His tight fitting breeches are scarlet with a swirling gold motif at the side seam. He wears a wide yellow and red waistband and a short sleeveless black jacket decorated with gold braid and a plain black hat. The central female stands with one foot pointed and is gazing towards the man who holds castanets in both hands, with his left arm folded behind his back and his right arm upraised.",
