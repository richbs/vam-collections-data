No date unless we may accept as eveidence \" 1783 \" set out on the first sheet.   Watermarks : Britannia in the single folders ; a design with a crown and fleur de lys in the larger sheets.   Bound in original mottled covers with leather back.   E. 997-1011--1902.\n\n<b>Summary of Contents.</b>--Coffin furniture, plates, handles, ornaments and sundries.\n\n<b>Comments.</b>--Tuesby and Cooper were probably wholesale ironmongers, and may have been manufacturers of the goods shown in the catalogue as it was a London trade.   The wares were almost certainly stamped tinplate or perhaps black iron.   There is written at the back of the first plate :   \" Sets of Coffin furniture Silver'd will be \" 6<sup>d</sup> per Set advance-Handles Silver'd from 1/- to 2/- p. \" dz. pair.\"   Prices are written in in every case.   The drawings are conventional and poorly executed.   There is one quaint exception to the coffin sets in the shape of \" Jappan \" Labels with plated frames and chains, dz. 5s. nett.\"\"",
