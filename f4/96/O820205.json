The rough sketches are on the back of a highly-finished design for a crucifix, a sheet which has been pasted together from three separate pieces of paper. They show the free play of the artist's imagination, including an intriguing decorative detail being derived from a cluster of fruit-like forms. Several ideas for architectural details are mixed up with a portrait head and sketches which might be for paintings or mural decoration.",

Volume I. 14th-16th century</u>, London, 1979, p. 28 The following is the full text of the entry: ALBERTI, CHERUBINO <i>known as</i> il Borgheggiano (1553-1615) 23 <i>Recto</i> Design for a crucifix, with two strips of paper each showing an angel pasted on below the arms of the Cross The two vertical panels inscribed 'Alto piedi no. 5 .. .' The right hand panel inscribed across the bottom with a scale Pen and ink and wash Size of sheet 18 x 10 1/8 (457 x 257) E\u20224448-I920 <i>Verso</i> Rough sketches of ornament and architecture, including part of a campanile, a male term, and a putto in a frieze; also a sketch of a girl holding a baby, and a girl's head Inscribed with various numerals and three times 'AI Molto Mag' or similar words Pen and ink; the study of a girl's head and one of the sketches of ornament touched with red wash PROVENANCE A. Grahl (Lugt 1199); Dr B. Geiger (sale, Sotheby, 7 December 1920, lot no. 2, as by Cherubino Alberti, bought by the Museum) The medallions at the four ends of the cross contain heads of God the Father and the three Marys. The attribution (first recorded in the Geiger sale catalogue, 1920) is not certain, but the sketches on the verso are reminiscent of those in a sketch-book of Alberti's in the Uffizi (inv. no. 93679 F). This book (p. 13, Gernsheim photo. no. 19752) contains a hatched study of a head similar to the girl's head in our drawing; it also contains several smaller and rougher sketches of figures similar to the girl holding a baby in our drawing (see especially p. 15 in the sketch-book, Gernsheim photo. no. 19755). The panels on each side of the crucifix in our drawing were probably added by a different hand.",
