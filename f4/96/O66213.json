The hair covers the top of the head like a cap and is modelled in a diaper pattern with a circular depression in each lozenge, which is repeated in the bulbous <i>ushnisha</i> on the top of the head. The eyebrows are delineated by two arching edges which continue into the bridge of the nose.  The eyes underneath are long narrow depressions under large curving upper lids and projecting lower ones with sharp edges. The long ears have lobes which splay away from the jaw line above the neck, which has one horizontal groove in it. The neck has a damaged lower edge where it has broken away from the remainder of the figure.",
