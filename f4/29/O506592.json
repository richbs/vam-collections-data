Volume II. 17th-18th century</u>, London, 1979, p. 106 The following is the full text of the entry: Design for a ciborium combined with an altar Inscribed in ink within the design \u2018Io fra Gio. Andrea da [illegible abbreviation] Affermo\u2019 and again in a different hand \u2018Io Franscesco Martelli\u2019 Pen and ink and brown wash, with some blue wash, over black chalk 27 x 12 \u00bd (685 x 318) 612 PROVENANCE Bought 1872 The figure on top is the resurrected Christ; below him the Virgin between two angels (of whom only one is actually shown). The figure in the niche on the left is St Catherine of Alexandra in her wheel; above her St Peter with his keys. The right side of the drawing is incomplete and nearly blank, except for a faint sketch in black chalk of a saint standing on a pediment. The drawing is made up of several sheets of paper of irregular shape pieced together. The lower part of the design looks too insubstantial to support the elaborate structure above: it has probably been altered since leaving the artist\u2019s hands. The drawing is not of very fine quality, but the inscriptions, recorded above, seem to show that it was used as the basis of a contract between an artist and his employer or employers. It is a good deal stained and damaged.",
