Studied at Royal Dublin Society's Drawing School 1814-20, then worked in Dublin as portrait painter. Member of RHA 1826, resigned 1837, re-elected 1847. Moved to London, worked as Sir Thomas Lawrence's studio assistant, completing pictures after Lawrence's death 1830. Successful portrait practice with several distinguished sitters; the <u>Art Journal</u> listed him among six most eminent portraitists in 1843 (p570). Exhibited 72 works at the RA between 1830 and 1862, 28 at the BI 1832-63, one at the SBA 1851, and at the Royal Hibernian Academy. Travelled on Continent 1831-4, inspiring Italian subjects. Returned to Dublin 1847-52, then London to 1854, short visits to USA 1854 and 1855, Rome 1856-8, Leamington, Warwickshire, until 1862. Travelled to Belfast, Paris, Brussels and Rome, where he died September 1868. Buried alongside the poet John Keats. According to Strickland, Rothwell wrote he 'was given to the dream of a posthumous fame', but he had 'a high, an extravagant, opinion of his own powers as a painter'. \n\nLIT: <u>Art JournaI</u> 1868, p245 (obit), 1872, p271; W G Strickland, <u>A Dictionary of Irish Artists II</u>, 1913, pp300-12 \n\n<b>The Very Picture of Idleness </b>\nFA179 Neg77419 \nCanvas, 76.1 X 71 cm (30 X 28 ins) \nSigned 'Richard Rothwell' on shawl br \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \nExhibited at the RA in 1842. The <u>Art Union</u> critic described the subject as 'A gay and laughing maiden with an expression of countenance which the pencil of this gentleman seems to reach better than that of any of his \ncontemporaries. The face beckons you with its laughing eyes - everything is resolved into inviting sweetness, in short she is \"Not very dashing, but extremely winning\"'. The <u>Athenaeum</u> also admired the work: \n\nWe presume [it] is to be regarded as a fancy piece. Real or ideal, the nymph is charming - a lazy, bright-eyed girl-leaning upon her arms, with a broad speaking smile, such as Murillo might not have disdained to paint. It gives us great pleasure to see Mr Rothwell at last justifying the predictions of his friends. His colouring has lost none of its delicacy, - while his hand has gained force. \n\nThe reference to Murillo's work is just; the concept of Rothwell's painting may be compared with Murillo's 'A Peasant Boy Leaning on a Sill' presented to the NG in 1826, and 'A Girl and her Duenna' (National Gallery of Art, Washington DC) in Lord Heytesbury's collection since 1823. \n\nEXH: RA 1842 (377) \n\nLIT: <u>Art Union</u> 1842, p125; <u>Athenaeum</u> 21 May 1842, p456 \n\n\n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
