The plan shows a central, vaulted, passage leading into the building instead of a front door.  It is, in fact, a plan for three separate houses, one for the Dean, one for the Chancellor and one for the Chanter, all entered from the centrally placed domed vestibule.  In each case the door leads into an entrance hall with a short flight of steps.  From this the visitor enters the main staircase hall.  The domed vestibule approached by a vaulted passage is a domestic version of the grotto Pearce built for Viscount Allen at Stillorgan.  See Edward McParland, p. 130.\n\nThe link between this plan and the Deanery is established by a map of the site in Fishamble Street (National Library of Ireland, Ms 2789, fol.12) and by the chapter acts of Christ Church which show that Pearce designed and built the house between 1731 and 1733.  On 12 August 1731 `a plan drawn by Capt. Edward Pearce Surveyor General of three Houses ordered to be built for the Habitation and residence of the Dean Chanter and Chancellor' was approved. [From Representative Church Body, Dublin, copy chapter acts of Christ Church Cathedral, vol iv, 21 Nov 1716; vol v 12 Aug 1731 and 15 Nov 1733.]",
