The great castrati were feted like rock stars. Women fainted or became hysterical with admiration during their performances. Many wore several miniature portraits of their heroes, like fans wearing the badges of their favourite group today. Not everyone succumbed, however. As early as 1702, in Tunbridge Walks at Drury Lane, a character exclaims \u2018And pray what are your Town Diversions? To hear a parcel of Italian eunuchs like so many cats, squawl.' \n\nIn the engraving, two servants carry a barrow labelled \u2018Ready Money\u2019, containing the huge sums he earned for his performances. Singers earned more in London than anywhere else in Europe. Senesino built a fine house in Italy and inscribed over the door \u2018twas the folly of the English had laid the foundation of it\u2019. The huge success of the castrati set the fashion in London for opera sung in Italian by foreign stars.",
