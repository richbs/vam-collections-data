In the earliest comprehensive account of the use of make-up in the English theatre, The Road To The Stage (1827) Leman Thomas Rede wrote that before adding pigment over a greasy base: 'it is best to pass a napkin, with a little pomatum on it, over the part to receive the colour, then touch the cheek with a little hair powder, which will set the colour, and then lay on the vermilion and carmine. A rabbit's foot is better than anything else for distributing the paint equally.'  \n\nThis hare's paw belonged to the great theatre-manager Sir Henry Irving, who died on 13th October 1905 when on tour in Bradford and staying at the Midland Hotel. The donor's aunt, Martha Brayshaw, was in charge of the bar at Bradford's Midland Hotel at the time, and a note attached to the paw shows that Irving's valet took it from Irving's dressing table after his death and presented it to her as a souvenir.",
