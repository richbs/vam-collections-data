Published ca. 19th century - early 20th century.\n\nThese songs celebrate Mrs Amelia Bloomer and her unconventional clothing! Mrs Bloomer was an Nineteenth century American liberal reformer, who campaigned against slavery, and for temperance and women\"s rights. Hearing that some women had been attacked by the media for wearing pantaloons and not the conventional crinoline dresses, she started to wear them herself. Amelia embarked on a national lecture tour, and soon became famous across the United States for her wearing these garments. Soon the name Bloomer became synonymous with women\"s loose knee-length trousers, and later with long loose underwear. Four pieces of ballroom dance music were sold with this cover: a schottische, a quadrille, a galop and some waltzes. Schottisches had a quick tempo like a polka, and were popular at this time. Quadrilles were also fashionable, especially after Napoleon favoured them at his court. They were a type of square dance, and many popular songs were adapted for this dance. Galops, as their name suggests, were also a quick dance. Waltzes could be of any tempo, quick or slow. One can imagine how wearing bloomers would be very appropriate for these quick dances!",
