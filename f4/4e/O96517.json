The rim is a wide band of silver, slightly everted, the lower edge beaded and the upper edge with a plain, moulded lip.  Beneath this lip is a repeating pattern of incised decoration of a downeard pointing palmette, flanked by an arc on either side.  Raised starpwork has been applied at regular intervals in the form of a stylised leaf, the lower section triangular in shape and overlaps the wooden bowl.  The interior of the bowl is lined with silver and is a hemispherical section with a stepped edge.\n[Lid (for a mazer)] The lid, of silver, is slightly domed with a wide concave rim.  The circumference has a repeating pattern of incised decoration consisting of an ogee arch interspersed with plain arc.  This is repeated on the inner edge of the cover.  The retaining rim slop[es slightly inwards and has a wavy edge.  The finial is a flared, tubular section, rising from a plain circular collar and is surmounted by a small, domed walnt disc, retained by an undulating edge.",

Traditionally mazers were wide flat-bottomed bowls made of close-grained hard wood with a silver rim, foot and central boss. Obsolete from the 1550s, they became newly popular when members of the Arts and Crafts Movement revived the form, as here. This one is made of walnut with silver mounts, with a silver cover with a walnut finial. \n\nHarry George Murphy (1884-1939), who designed it, established his own workshop in London in 1913. He was also an influential teacher and was the first silversmith to be appointed Principal of the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London.",
