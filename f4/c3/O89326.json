The prime function of jets seems to have been to signify that pilgrims had completed their journeys, and reached the shrine of St James (the patron Saint of Spain) at the Cathedral of Santiago, which pilgrims did over the course of six hundred years, from the twelfth to the eighteenth century. \n\nThis figure is originally from a crucifix. It seems likely that the figure was made of separate pieces of jet joined together, and this is why it was more vulnerable to damage. Twenty-one small holes drilled into the crown of thorns almost certainly held thorns. Also the arms were dowelled in.\nDespite its fragmentary condition, this is one of the most impressive jets in the V&A collection. The anatomy of the body is subtly conveyed, and the drapery is similarly suggested in fluent manner. Unlike many of the surviving Spanish jets, this one seems to be by a sculptor aware of carved work in other materials such as wood, rather than a craftsman with a poor grasp of sculptural traditions.",
