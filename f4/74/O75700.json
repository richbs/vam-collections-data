He was an ardent supporter of liberal causes and regularly produced lino-cut and letterpress posters, poster-poems, illustrations and printed books to do with social causes, racial equality and freedom of conscience. His work often incorporates quotations from poets, great thinkers and politicians. \n\nMartin Luther King, a minister from Atlanta, Georgia, became the father of the American Civil Rights Movement through his pacifist campaigning from the mid 1950s until his assassination in 1968 in Memphis, Tennessee. On 28 August 1963, a Civil Rights March on Washington, DC, was attended by 250,000 supporters. King made his famous 'I have a dream . . .' speech about racial harmony and integration on the steps of the city's Lincoln Memorial monument. It is this speech that Piech quotes here.",
