For the other objects, see entries for Cat. Nos 190-192; the remaining three are lockets set with the hair of three of the alleged sitters for the miniatures. (1)\n\n<b>Provenance:</b> George Salting; according to a note by Long in the department files, Salting recorded in his notebook (now lost) that the set was from the collection of the Duke of Leeds (presumably George, 10th Duke, b.1862); bequeathed by Salting to the Museum, 1910. \n\n<b>Literature:</b> Long 1930, p. 93 (Anon.); <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 70 (Anon., English?). \n\nWhen purchased by Salting, the set was attributed to Hoskins - a frequent attribution at that time for very small miniatures - but always regarded as doubtful in this case. Subsequently the suggestion of Samuel Cooper was made, but this attracted no support. Long was initially quite puzzled, feeling that three of them were by one hand and the fourth - i.e., Cat. No. 192- by a different, possibly French, artist. At one point he seems to have considered du Guernier as the author of the three. (2) Eventually, on the basis of the illustration in Williamson 1904 (3) showing the Bohemian chain of 1632-3, (4) he considered Alexander Cooper, but Goulding pointed out to him orally that the cravats worn in the 'three' were of no earlier than 1650: comparison should therefore be with the Danish royal portraits of 1656. (5) For the firm and confident hatching of the features, the brightness and clarity of the colouring, the plain blue background and the small format, Alexander Cooper seems certainly the best suggestion, at least for the 'three'. But the small size, together with the uncertainty about Alexander Cooper's work especially late in his career, make a firm attribution impossible. \n\nThe original identification must have been intended to be Lucius Cary, 2nd Viscount Falkland (1610-1643), the scholar, politician and soldier, central figure of the pre-war GreatTew set, killed at the first Battle of New bury, 20 September 1643, and frequently the subject of optimistic identifications of portraits. But Long, attempting to square the obvious date of the miniature with the non-specific information on the label, substituted his son, also Lucius, 3rd Viscount Falkland, born July 1632, who died unmarried and relatively undistinguished at Montpellier in September 1649. But both are, as Goulding pointed out, impossible. The spelling 'Carey' on the label may have been intended to be antique: the now standard spelling 'Cary' seems to have been adopted when the collateral branch of the family, in the person of Lucius Henry Cary (1687-1730), who was descended from the youngest son (a monk at Douai) of the 1st Viscount, inherited the title in 1694. \n\n1 V&A Department of Metalwork, M568/570-1910. \n2 His perception of du Guernier was, at least partly, as a British artist and was based on a misreading of what has since been recognised as a Richard Gibson monogram; see Gibson, Cat. No. 98. \n3 Vol. I, pl. XLVIII. \n4 Last recorded at the Bode Museum; Murdoch 1981, fig. 136. \n5 Rosenborg Castle; Murdoch 1981, fig.140; Foskett 1979, pl. 20G/I.\" ",
