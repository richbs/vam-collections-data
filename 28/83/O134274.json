As she describes it: 'The annual accounts of the Duchy of Cornwall reveal Prince Charles leading a life of abject luxury and privilege. It is commonly known that one of his servant's daily task is to squeeze the prince's toothpaste.'\n\n'Marf' drew daily topical cartoons for the Evening Standard between March 2002 and August 2005, moving to the Londoner's Diary page in August 2003. The drawings cover key political and social issues of the period, providing a vivid and often hilarious response to the main news of the day. The Evening Standard is London's only evening newspaper, publishing up to five editions a day. In Marf's own words: 'The cartoonist needs to keep up with the rapid pace of event.'",
