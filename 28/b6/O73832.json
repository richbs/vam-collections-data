They were made for his new library, on the first floor of Powderham Castle, Devon. The technique of inlaying brass into veneers of wood was fashionable in London between about 1735 and 1760. John Channon, who worked in London, is the best-known maker who used this technique. This is only because he marked these bookcases with engraved brass plaques carrying his name and the date.  Other makers used the same techniques but much of their work is now anonymous.\n\nOn loan to Powderham Castle, Devon.",
