The trade card of the London glassman Colebron Hancock, for example, illustrated dishes similar to these, also apparently with elaborate ormolu mounts. Glass 'manufacturers' like Hancock would buy glass blanks from neighbouring glasshouses, cut them and have them mounted in ormolu (decorative gilt bronze) for sale to the top end of the market. Despite their solid construction and apparent resistence to breakage, extremely few of these mounted dishes have survived.",
