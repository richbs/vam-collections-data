He collected items not particularly because he was researching for a specific production, but simply because they took his fancy.  He amassed a collection of hats and headdresses, including several from Eastern Europe, like this cap, which is probably Hungarian or Polish in origin.  There is also the possibility that he wore some of them at fancy dress balls, which were a popular recreation among high society in the early and mid 20th century.  \n\nOliver Messel (1904-1978) was Britain's leading theatre designer from the early 1930s to the mid 1950s, working in every aspect of entertainment - ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue - as well as in interior decoration and textile design.  His lavish, painterly and romantic designs informed by period styles, were perfectly in tune with his times and earned him an international reputation.  By 1960, however, Messel's style had become unfashionable, having no sympathy with the new 'kitchen sink' school of theatre.  He increasingly concentrated on his non-theatrical painting and designing and eventually retired to the Caribbean, where he began a new career designing and building highly idiosyncratic luxury villas.",
