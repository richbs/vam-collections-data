The cylindrical body is chamfered and tapers inwards as it rises to a flat, everted rim which is broader than the base.  \n\nThe rim is decorated with two bands of epigraphic frieze, around the mouth of the body and on the edge of the rim. Between these are eight roundels which enclose four-petalled flowers.  In the intervals between the petals are engraved lotus flowers. Four roundels of half the diameter are paced in opposite points between the larger roundels.  These enclose inlaid copper discs engraved with human faces, representing the solar disc.  In the four remaining spaces between the larger roundels, birds in profile turn their heads to look back at the solar discs.  The ground is engraved with a scrollwork pattern.\n\nThe walls and base are decorated with three horizontal engraved friezes, separated by two narrow bands of ornament.  The topmost frieze features the trellis pattern.  The central, main frieze, double the height of the preceding one, features four large eight-petalled rosettes alternating with four epigraphic sections, all against a scrolling ground.  The slanting base also has an epigraphic frieze, divided into eight cartouches by lotus-bud escutcheons.\n\nPatina: red oxidation with patches of dull green sulphurous copper.",
