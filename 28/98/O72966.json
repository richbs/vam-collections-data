The Laocoon is a famous Roman sculpture dating from the first century AD. It was discovered in Rome in 1506 during excavations and is now in the Vatican Museum. The subject is the Trojan priest Laokoon and his two sons, who are attacked by a sea monster outside the city walls of Troy. Since its discovery, the work has deeply influenced sculptors in terms of pose and anatomy. This mask by Deere is one of numerous copies of the Laocoon in whole or part.",
