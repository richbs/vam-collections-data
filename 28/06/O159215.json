The central panel has a white ground. The motifs have been outlined with black cross stitch and the ground is worked with close lines of running stitch with white silk, giving the effect of a pulled thread ground. The pattern is offset rows of blue octagon alternating with a white cross, each containing a small central diamond and 4 linked motifs.  Four diagonal cartouches fill the spaces.  The pattern is too big for the space and the motifs are cut by the borders.\nEmbroidery: 2S-twist silk: black, faded pink, green, two shades of blue, light brown, mid-brown.\nBacking: brown silk\nFacing: green silk\nThe red border is embroidered with an inscription in Armenian on two sides.",
