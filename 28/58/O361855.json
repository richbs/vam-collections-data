They formed a frieze that was particularly suitable for embroidery with figure subjects, often featuring a narrative to provide interest and entertainment. Sets of bed hangings also created a draught-free and private sleeping compartment. \n\nThe style and workmanship of these valances suggests that they were made in a professional workshop either in France itself or under strong French influence. Both show scenes from the Metamorphoses by the Latin poet Ovid : the death of Adonis, and the transformation of Myrrha.",
