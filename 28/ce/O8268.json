Made whilst the artist was at Swansea College of Art.\n\nHistorical significance: In a letter to Michael Archer, Deputy Keeper of the Ceramics and Glass Department, Miss Jones described her working method and the development of the piece. [Registered Papers 81/2404.] The work evolved from the use of magazine cuttings which were in some way concerned with the reflection or distortion of light. These were arranged in a \"rough spiral with a calmer centre representing a sort of 'arrival'.\" The residue of the ideas expressed in the cuttings informed the selection of different glasses and treatments as the work progressed. Miss Jones' \"overriding idea was to trap as much light as I could.\" She felt that the \"use of lead would be too inhibiting\" and used instead a large variety of techniques including \"bending, fusing, acid etch and a bit of sand blast.\" \n\n \"The oozy bits were kiln-formed from crushed 'dal', clear and black, in loose copper foil moulds, later shaped with a linisher to fit where required. The central pieces were made from strips of commercial glass laid edgewise on float and kiln fused part surrounded by flame moulded glass rods. Finally, for this piece I deliberately left as many air bubbles as I could in the epoxy resin to capture still more light.\"",
