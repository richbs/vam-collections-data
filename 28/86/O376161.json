The main purpose of all these acquisitions was to help improve the quality of design among British artisans.\n\nIt was described as a modern Turkish head ornament from Mount Lebanon when it was acquired, but it could have come from almost anywhere in the Ottoman sphere of influence at the time, including the Balkans.  It is half a clasp, which may have been worn on the head, but was more usually used to fasten a woman\u2019s clothing.",
