He signed certain pieces of his work with OPUS MODERNI (opus is the Latin term for 'work' - which then means 'work of the modern'). The modern here is referring to the Ancient World, in contrary to the Naturalism of the Gothic. His earliest works may date around 1485-1490, and his earliest dated work is 1490. Moderno specialised in small bronze plaquettes exploring religious or antique themes, and catered for a clientele of learned humanists.\n\nThe Nemean lion was a monster in Greek mythology that lived at Nemea and terrorised the city. It was killed by Heracles as the first of his 12 labours. It had a golden fur and thus couldn't be killed conventionally but just by strangling it.",
