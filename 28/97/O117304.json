            "public_access_description": "St Mary Magdalene was one of the most devoted followers of Jesus Christ. The Gospels record her presence at the Crucifixion, and Christ appeared to her first after his Resurrection.\n\nLater legends claim that she, like the Apostles, was instructed to spread the word of Christ. One story relates that she sailed from the Holy Land and landed in France, near Marseilles. There she lived as a hermit in a cave. When she died, her body was taken for burial to the nearby town known today as St-Maximin. There is a shrine to St Mary in the crypt of the church there, while the church at Sainte-Baume in Provence marks the site of the cave, and is still a pilgrimage site.\n\nIn the 11th century monks came to St-Maximin and stole the body of St Mary, taking it to V\u00e9zelay in Burgundy. Throughout the Middle Ages the priests at St-Maximin maintained that the wrong body had been stolen, but V\u00e9zelay's position on the pilgrimage route to Santiago de Compostela ensured its claim gained the most support. \n\nLegends about St Mary Magdalene grew over the centuries. The Golden Legend,  a compilation of saints' lives written about 1260, records that while she was living in the cave angels bore her up to heaven seven times a day for heavenly food.\n\nIn this panel the Magdalene is showen rising to heaven on one of these occasions. In the past people have often interpreted it as an image of her rising to heaven after her death.",

The other bears the arms of the town of Baden in the canton Aargau, Switzerland.\n\nSt. Mary Magdalene was one of the most devoted followers of Jesus Christ. The Gospels record her presence at the Crucifixion and Christ appeared to her first after his Resurrection, thus signifying her special position.\n\nThere is no further reference in the New Testament to Mary but later legends claim that she, like the Apostles, was instructed to spread the word of Christ. One legend that has gained the most credence claims that she sailed with a companion from the Holy Land and landed on the southern shores of France, near Marseilles. There she lived in a cave, a hermit, her godly life admired by those living nearby. \n\nThe cave where she lived was in Provence at Ste-Baume. Today there is a church dedicated to her there and it is still a pilgrimage site.\n\nThe legends say she died in the cave and her body was taken for burial to the nearby town known today as St-Maximin. There is a shrine to St. Mary in the crypt in the church there.\n\nIn the 11th century monks came to St-Maximin and stole the body of St. Mary and took it to the church in Vezelay in Burgundy. The priests at St-Maximin maintained throughout the Middle Ages that the wrong body was stolen but Vezelay\u2019s position on the pilgrimage route to Santiago de Compostela ensured that their claim would gain the most support. \n\nOver the centuries, the legends of the life and death of St. Mary Magdalene grew. The mid 13th century compilation of saints\u2019 lives known as The Golden Legend records that when she was living in the cave, angels bore her up to heaven seven times a day for her heavenly food.\n\nThe image depicted in this panel shows her rising to heaven on one of these occasions. In the past this has often been mis-interpreted as an image of her rising to heaven after her death.",
