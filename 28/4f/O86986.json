However, by the 1920s and 1930s tobacco manufacturers were targeting women with advertisements that made smoking look glamorous. Film stars such as Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich and Bette Davis all helped to promote smoking as stylish and sexy. By the 1930s there were large numbers of men and women smokers. The dangers of smoking were barely recognised. In fact advertisements showed cigarettes as beneficial to health. For example, people thought smoking calmed their nerves and helped them to stay slim.",
