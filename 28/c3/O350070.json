            "public_access_description": "This roundel in relief represents Cupid being instructed in architecture and is made by Alessandro Leopardi in Venice in the late 15th or early 16th century.\n\nCupid was the son of Venus and god of love and could make both men and gods fall in love with each other at will with his arrows, and thus embodies unbridled passion.\nCupid also continually challenges and causes disorder. Hence, how to bring Cupid under control has been a question since antiquity. The solution was to educate him.\nCupid needs order, proportion, symmetry and good measure. This means education in the discipline of the quadrivium, which consisted of arithmetic, geometry, music and astronomy. All this again is the basis for an education in architecture.\nThe education of gods and heroes was a popular theme in the Renaissance, mirroring the revival of classical learning.",
