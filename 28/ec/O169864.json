This led to an increase in the number of pilgrimage sites in the Catholic area, and a massive expansion in the production of religious medals, crosses and souvenir jewellery, often in a form that was specific to a particular holy site. \n\nThe pendant on this necklace probably came from one such centre.  Worshippers believed that images of saints or the Virgin and Child could work miracles and offer protection against illness or the dangers of travel.  \n\nThis necklace was bought for \u00a33 8s as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867",
