In the lowest unit the Buddha sits in meditation on a lotus throne under a bodhi tree, with two monks on either side in veneration.  In the central scvene, the Buddha stands in abhayamudra with two worshippers.  On the top unit which is damaged one can  recognize  the Buddha on the lotus throne with his hands in dharmacakramudra.   On the left frieze four units each with the Buddha in meditation is shown. On the right lateral frieze lively Erotes in large proportions are shown.",
