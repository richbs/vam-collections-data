He was appearing as Jim Cheese, a dog trainer, in The Earl and the Girl by Seymour Hicks, with music by Ivan Caryll. It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre of Varieties, Hanley. He compiled them in a series of albums.\n\nThe musical concerned the missing heir to the Earldom of Stole and how Dick Wargrave, the missing heir, gets Jim Cheese to impersonate him at a grand ball at Stole Hall. The musical was a great success when it opened in London at the Adelphi Theatre in December 1903. Although continuing its run in London throughout 1904, another company was formed to take it to regional theatres. This had a large orchestra, a full chorus, and scenery and costumes that were praised by a local reviewer as \u2018superb\u2019.",
