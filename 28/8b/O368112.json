Most of the panel is wool (with a wool warp) but linen weft is used at the base. The decoration includes a jewelled looped cross / ankh at the centre. Within the loop is a face wearing a jewelled diadem, surrounded with a solid red border. The cross  is within a rectangular maroon border and at each corner are maroon vases with green vines coming from the top. Dots are on either side of the vase bases. Above the cross, at the top, is a short cross-like icon made of a central diamond with a leaf / spade shaped arm on each side. This is all bordered with a maroon vine motif.\n\nBoth sides are selvedge and include the remains of linen threads that would have attached the panel to another piece of cloth. These are of several z-spun linen threads s-plied together This cloth was probably linen as some of it remains on the reverse. This fragment includes a woven strip of red wool along one edge. The bottom left linen edge has been twinned with a thicker fibre (wool or flax?) composed of z-spun threads plied together. There appears to be a drop of a glue like substance in this corner. A more modern thread (shimmering and yellow) ream ins at the right side of the bottom edge indicating that the panel has been attached to another fabric in more recent times. The head within the looped cross has a black stitching thread (2 threads, s-plied) around it. It is possible that the head has been attached at a later date.
