Charcoal is a blackish residue of impure carbon produced by slowly heating animal and vegetable substances to high temperatures to remove water. It has been used as a drawing material since prehistoric times. Charcoal can be recognised in drawings by its soft tones and uneven lines that are worked up to create varying depth. Kennedy and Francis advertised as \"The Only Complete Art Store\" in The Year's Art magazine between 1887-88, and this box of charcoal must date from then. The business had traded as \"Kennedy and Brown, artists' colourmen\" from 1881 until 1885, when the partnership dissolved. Kennedy and Francis is documented at 17 Oxford Street, London, between 1887 and 1900.",
