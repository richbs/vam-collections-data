The chair represents the revival and continuation of the practices of the Bauhaus -the leading school of Modernist design - in East Germany after the Second World War, and indeed was designed by a former Bauhaus student, Selman Selmanagic. The chair was made at the Deutsche Werkst\u00e4tten in Hellerau (near Dresden), one of the most important furniture-making workshops in 20th-century Germany. It is part of Selmanagic's interior design for the SED Parteihochschule 'Karl Marx' (training academy of the East German communist party) in Kleinmachnow near Berlin, built in 1947-9. As the debates concerning an appropriate 'socialist style' escalated in the late 1940s, the Deutsche Werkst\u00e4tten came under attack for their adherence to a so-called 'formalist' Bauhaus design approach. Walter Ulbricht, the General Secretary of the SED condemned formalist design, later stating that he thought Selmanagic's furniture inappropriate for this particular building.",

First, it demonstrates the place of modernist design in the socialist planned economy (during the Stalinist and Khruschev eras respectively). Secondly, it points to the post-war history of the Bauhaus in Germany, and to the history of one of Germany's most important furniture-making workshops, the Deutsche Werkst\u00e4tten.

Parts of V2's were stored in the basement of the Deutsche Werkst\u00e4tten. In East Germany this is the only known design object using former war materials. In the 1950s the curved backrest was criticised during the formalism debate and called 'cow udder'.",
