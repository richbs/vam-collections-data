There are 5 remaining tassels.  Right-hand side: there is one cord oversewn with dark blue wool.  All 5 sides have a stout red cord attached to the edge.  Between that and the pile on the left-hand side is a Z-twisted cord on the lower half and a red woollen braid on the other part.  This braid, with an interruption, goes along the top 2 sides and the bottom but the right-hand side has the cord along the entire length.  This side has 4 tassels.\n\nEND FINISH: lower: 2 cms. plain weave with purple weft is turned and stitched.  Fringe: 25 cords bound with coloured thread are looped between the 2 braids and are cross-tied with tassels to form a lattice fringe with 3 rows of tassels in various colours 43.5 cms maximum length.  Upper: obscured by applied heading tape.\n\nDESIGN: field: white ground with 11 vertical lines, 1 purple, decorated in part with multi-coloured flowerheads.  The two outer lines form an uninterrupted line of flowerheads.  These lines rest on a saw-toothed diagonal lattice, the lower left/top right in purple, the others in red and green.  Within the lattice the lines bear two types of motifs: (i) a cross-shaped motif within which along the line is a row of three motifs: the central diamond is light orange and the others are green, all outlined red.  The central line divides to form a pair of horns at the top of the field arch.\n\nMain border: (sides only) has a green ground with red, stepped lozenges alternating with opposing pairs of hooked motifs, each in white and light orange.  The lower border has similar lozenges which alternate with a hooked motif joined by a vertical bar but remaining partly white and light orange.\n\nInner and outer borders: (sides and lower border onlyh) a reciprocal 'running dog' design in white and purple; along the two right-hand borders and the upper bottom border, the purple enclosing a red triangle.\n\nTop border extends along the top of the five-sided field and the side borders and is composed of narrow horizontal lozenges in contrasting colours.\n\nCatalogue date: 22.2.95",
