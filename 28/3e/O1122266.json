            "physical_description": "[Lion Tamer] The lion tamer is wearing a blue jacket and a red fez. He has straight arms with no elbow joints.\n[Chinese Acrobat] The Chinese acrobat is wearing a purple robe with yellow edging, and cream trousers. He has a thin ponytail made of plaited string. \n[Clowns] These clowns are dressed in printed cotton all-in-one suits. These have faded over the years and are now off-white with red and light blue patterns. The paint on these clowns faces have severely started to peel off. Both clowns have wooden hats on, it is thought that at one point there wooden hats were covered with material.\n[Elephants] The female rider has straight, unjointed arms and legs. She is wearing a green top with gold ribbon, and a cream coloured skirt that may have once been pink. There is a joint in her neck that could indicate that it once was broken and fixed back together. \n[Camel] These elephants have been painted dark grey. They both have grey leather ears and white painted wooden tusks. Both have sections of paint coming off, especially around the area of the neck joint.\n[Horses] The camel is painted brown/orange and has two humps, making it a Bactrian camel. \n[Kangaroo] The monkey is painted dark brown and has slightly splayed legs which means he is most stable in the sitting postion. He is wearing an orange felt leotard suit with fluffy edging, and matching hat. The paint on his face is peeling significantly.\n[Donkey] One horse is brown with a black mane and white nose, the other is white all over with a black mane. The brown horse comes with a leather saddle, while the white horse has, instead, a platform for a performer to stand. Both have tails made from string/fabric.\n[Poodle] The kangaroo is painted orange/brown on its body but its legs, arms and nose are white. It has short, straight front arms and stands up by creating a tripod between its legs and its long tail.\n[Brown Bear] The donkey is painted dark brown all over but the paint is peeling in some places, especially near the joints and on the face.\n[Polar Bear] The seal is painted grey and sits primarily on its tail and lower half of the body. \n[Giraffe] The poodle is painted white and has an oversized head, and string tail. The paint is severely coming away from the poodle, espeically around the head. The wood on the body of the poodle is also in poor condition and is showing cracks. \n[Ladders] The brown bear has been painted dark brown all over, although his feet are almost green, perhaps because of wear. Both of the bears ears are missing, as is its tail.\n[Chairs] The polar bear is painted white/cream and has small leather ears. Its mouth is open and teeth have been painted inside.\n[Barrel] The giraffe is painted yellow with brown patches all over its body. Its long neck is jointed at both the bottom and the top.\n[Ball] White painted ladders with eight rungs.\n[Tub] White painted square chairs with upright backs.",

The Humpty Dumpty Circus, as it was known, was first produced in 1903 after the patent for the clown figure was granted. It became extremely popular very quickly and soon grew to around 37 animals, 29 figures and over 40 different accessories. Unfortunately, the Humpty Dumpty Circus did not last long as Schoenhut's Toy Company went out of business in 1935 due to the global economic depression.",

The first models of the figures featured glass eyes, which were soon replaced by carved eyes in the 1920s to save money. By 1923 the company were losing sales and decided to introduce the reduced size circus. Although they were very popular and sold well, the company was hit hard by the depression and were out of business by 1935.\n\nThe animals and figures sold in the Humpty Dumpty Circus were fully flexible with multiple tightly-strung joints. There were slots and holes placed into the toys that allowed them to be positioned in many different ways and with many different items. Schoenhut claimed that there were 10,0001 ways to play with the Humpty Dumpty Circus, making it a versatile and exciting set.\n\nAn original copy of the catalogue was donated with this gift and is now located in the departmental library at MoC.",
