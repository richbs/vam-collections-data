This building was home to hundreds of impoverished immigrant families, mostly from Europe, from 1863 when it was built, until 1935 when new building regulations forced out the remaining tenants. Wallpaper was one of the cheapest and easiest ways to personalise a living a space so it was common for new tenants to re-paper; an excavation of the building (begun in 1994) found up to 22 layers of wallpaper in some of the rooms. Several of these papers (including this one and E.830-2002) were reproduced by the American wallpaper manufacturer Scalamandr\u00e9 for their 'Historic Collection'. This paper has been used in the Tenement Museum in the reconstruction of the Rogarshevsky family apartment.",
