The company had been in existence since the mid-nineteenth century and was already making soft toys. It quickly established itself as one of the leading manufacturers. Farnell used the trademark Alpha. Its factory was destroyed twice, once by fire in 1934 and once by bombing in 1940. It survived both these disasters but eventually ceased trading in the 1960s.\n\nAs well as teddy bears Farnell made soft toys and cloth dolls. It produced some puppets and this monkey is an unusual example because it has all four limbs rather than the more usual two, and would have been quite hard to manipulate.",
