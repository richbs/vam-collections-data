            "public_access_description": "The head of a beardless youth is depicted in profile facing right with a club behind him, with a Greek inscription, 'Gnaios'. The subject is ultimately derived from an ancient beryl intaglio depicting the young Hercules, which is now in the British Museum (inv. no. 1867, 0507.318). This was often reproduced in the 18th and 19th centuries, in both engravings and in sculpted forms. It is inscribed with the name of the carver, Gnaios, who was later confused with Gnaeus or Cnaeus Pompeius (75-45 BCE), known as Pompey the Younger. For this reason the subject of the gem was thought to be Pompey the Younger, who was himself on occasion confused with his father, known as Pompey the Great, sometimes portrayed as Hercules with his club. It was later realized that the name Gnaios was in fact the signature of the artist, rather than the name of the subject, and that the club did indeed refer to the subject as Hercules. The present ivory seems likely to be based on an engraving, rather than on a gem. It is interesting and puzzling that the vertical format of the gem and of the engraved versions was changed to the more horizontal shape seen here. Possibly this was because it was designed to be set onto a piece of furniture or smaller cabinet. The neo-classical style suggests this ivory was probably made in Italy in the second half of the 18th century.",
