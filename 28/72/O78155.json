The architect and designer Robert Hooke (1635-1703) made detailed designs for the house and its gardens, and building began in 1680.  It ranked as one of the most substantial houses of its day, although Conway's untimely death in 1683 cut short the building programme. It was not finally finished until the 19th century, by which time Hooke's original plan had been added to and details altered. This view shows Hooke's original gardens, which were re-laid in the late 19th century.\n\n People\nLeonard Knyff (1650-1722) was a Dutch draughtsman and painter. He worked with Johannes Kip (1653-1722), a Dutch draughtsman and engraver, on topographical views of British country houses and gardens.\n\nTrading\nPrinted views by Kip after Knyff were published in the first volume of Britannia Illustrata (1707), of which this print was plate 71, in a second volume (1715), and again in Le Nouveau Theatre de la Grande Bretagne (1715).  Le Nouveau Theatre reprinted the whole of Britannia Illustrata as well as other topographical plates.",
