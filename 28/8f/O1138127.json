The original owner of this game, Keith Ball thinks he was given this game because his friend Joe Bird had a Subbuteo set that he enjoyed playing. This complete boxed set is one of the very earliest examples of the first game produced in England. It was made by the Parker Games division of the Palitoy Company in the early 1970s and we know that it was given to Keith by his parents as a Christmas present, probably in 1971. There was a World Cup version brought out in 1974. Palitoy later went on the manufacture other sets including the Super Striker series.",
