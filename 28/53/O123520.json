The design is coupled with a typewritten description of the dress, detailing the lightweight wool with contrasting trimming out of which it is intended to be made, available colours, size suitability and price (E.483:18-2005). The design was available in grey or black with yellow wool facings, (a piece of material used to conceal the seam of a garment and prevent fraying), or in grey, navy, fawn or black with white pique facings. On the design, yellow crayon applied under the collar indicates the wool facings sewn to the suit. A smaller pencil sketch to the right shows the back of the dress. The design would have been used as a presentation drawing and forms part of an album of 12 designs with accompanying descriptions from which the client could choose what she wanted to have made.",
