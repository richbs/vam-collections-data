The King was opposed to the parliamentary reform of 1832 although he was eventually forced grudgingly to accept it. The Reform Act reduced the power of the Tory aristocrats to the benefit of Earl Grey's Whig government. In May 1832 Charles Grey asked the King to create at least 50 new Peers to overcome the House of Lords who were opposed to parliamentary reform.  At first William refused.  The play at the Coburg Theatre that night was actually Tom Thumb. Beneath the image is printed: REFORM! REFORM!! King. 'Petition me - no Petitions, Sir, today' 'Her Majesty the Queen is in a passion'.",
