It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years.  Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nNoni was a clown musician whose curious costume and high bald wig were his comical trademark.  He was appearing at the Oxford New Theatre as one of many acts on a variety bill.  The theatre had only been open since February 1934 but it had quickly built a good reputation for variety and by 1936 was a 'Number 1 date' for Variety shows, particularly in the summer.",
