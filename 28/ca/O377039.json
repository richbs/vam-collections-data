This design made it particularly suitable as a vessel to contain soups and broths. As its French name suggests, it was a form of vessel more popular in France (and also in Germany) than in England. A late-sixteenth-century French engraving depicts a family at table who are about to use shallow, flat-handled (but lidless) \u00e9cuelles on plates (Robert Boissart, Concordia, ca. 1590). The fact that the sick or bedridden required nourishing meat soup or broth meant the \u00e9cuelle was also used away from the dining table, but illness was not always the reason for its appearance in the bedroom. The wealthy rose late in the eighteenth century, and while they were groomed and dressed they also breakfasted -- perhaps in the company of select guests. Their morning meal included broth served in an \u00e9cuelle, which may also have been set on a plate. The plate served as a stand for the bowl, rather than as a dish for serving food. The crowned 'AS' monogram on the side of this bowl and on the lid is that of Princess Augusta Sophia, daughter of George III, who owned it some time between 1830 and 1840.",

            "history_note": "Two different sets of engraved initials on the bowl and lid testify to different owners. The identity of the owner with the earlier set of initials --  'E.A.Fs' -- is obscure, but the crowned 'AS' monogram is that of Princess Augusta Sophia, daughter of George III. The \u00e9cuelle was stated to have been one of the Cumberland heirlooms (Lightbown: 1978, cat. no. 39). The present gilding probably dates from the early 19th century. It was bequeathed to the Museum in 1933 by Major Thomas Sutton Timmis.\n\nHistorical significance: This is a finely-wrought and well-preserved example of a type of vessel popular in eighteenth-century France. The snake motif on the handle was also popular, and appears on other pieces of French silver as well as on English imitations. The handles of two late- seventeenth-century \u00e9cuelles made in Paris (and now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) have lids with a similar snake handle. One of these, dated 1670-71, is part of a toilet service commissioned for William of Orange and Mary, Princess of England. (See Dennis (1960), I, cat. no. 350). Another, similar bowl with a lid decorated with leaf pattern and a snake-handled motif, from around 1750-1800, is in the Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs, Paris (see Mabille: 1984, cat. no. 275). For English imitations of the snake motif see the shallow lidded sugar bowl marked for 1683-4 in the V&A (Museum no. 53-1865).\n\nThe \u00e9cuelle discussed here, by Jean Delahaye, is also of interest because among its marks is an early instance of a duty mark. For duty (and wardens') marks on French silver, see Dennis (1960), II, pp. 14-22, and Bimbenet-Privat and de Fontaines (1995). Jean Delahaye became a master goldsmith and was admitted to the Paris goldsmiths' guild in 1621 (see letter from Michelle Bimbenet-Privat dated 21 June 1993, in object folder in Metalwork Section files).",

            "historical_context_note": "The \u00e9cuelle is a lidded, shallow, bowl with two flat handles (for gripping between finger and thumb). This design made it particularly suitable as a vessel to contain soups and broths. As its French name suggests, it was a form of vessel more popular in France (and also in Germany) than in England. A late-sixteenth-century French engraving depicts a family at table who are about to use shallow, flat-handled (but lidless) \u00e9cuelles on plates (Robert Boissart, <u>Concordia</u>, ca. 1590). The fact that the sick or bedridden required nourishing meat soup or broth meant the \u00e9cuelle was also used away from the dining table, but illness was not always the reason for its appearance in the bedroom. The wealthy rose late in the eighteenth century, and while they were groomed and dressed they also breakfasted -- perhaps in the company of select guests. Their morning meal included broth served in an \u00e9cuelle, which may also have been set on a plate. The plate served as a stand for the bowl, rather than as a dish for serving food. (For an image of a 1755-7 Augsburg toilet service by Gottlieb Satzger and Johann Georg Kloss, which includes in its centre an \u00e9cuelle, see Gruber (1982), pl. 385 [opposite p. 262.])",
