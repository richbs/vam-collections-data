            "history_note": "Historical significance: Giambattista was one of the most renowned painters of eighteenth-century Italy. He studied in the workshop of Gregorio Lazzarini. However Tiepolo moved away from the classicising style of his master, creating instead works with a focus on tonal qualities in the manner employed by his contemporaries Giambattista Piazzetta and Giovanni Battista Pittoni. This follows in the tradition of the sixteenth-century artist Tiepolo. Tiepolo began his career painting a series of canvases depicting <i>Prophets</i> and <i>Apostles</i> for S Maria dei Derelitti, Venice, in 1715-16. He is documented on the register of the Venetian confraternity of painters in the following year. \n\nBy the 1720's Tiepolo's success at home brought many commissions from outside Venice. Between 1725-6 he worked in Udine, on a scheme of frescoes for the Patriarchal Palace (now the Archbishop's Palace) for the Patricarch Dionsio Dolfin. In 1730-31 Tiepolo worked in Milan producing works including frescoes for five ceilings in the Palazzo Archinto. During the 1740s, Tiepolo was at the height of his fame. He produced paintings indcluding  the <i> Family of Darius before Alexander</i> (1743) and the frescoes of <i>The meeting of Anthony and Cleopatra</i> and <i>The Banquet of Anthony and Cleopatra</i> for the Palazzo Labia, Venice. From 1750-3 Tiepolo worked in W\u00fcrzburg on a commission for frescoes of the ceiling and walls for the Kaisersaal of the Residenz at W\u00fcrzburg. Again in Venice, Tiepolo became the president of the Venetian Academy in 1756. In March, 1762, Tiepolo was summoned by Charles III of Spain (reigned 1759-88) to paint three ceiling frescoes in the Palacio Real, Madrid. He travelled that year with his sons, Giandomenico and Lorenzo, to work on the project. He was to remain in Spain until his death in 1770. Tiepolo's works ranged from frescoes and paintings on canvas of histories, mythologies and religious subjects. As well as these works, which were the result of commissions from patrons, Tiepolo also produced a series of etchings. Tiepolo was an expert printmaker. His output can be seen in the two main groups of etchings that he produced, the <i>Capricci</i>, a group of ten prints, and the 24 <i>Scherzi di fantasia</i>. Stylistically these works probably date to the 1730s or 1740s.\n\nIn his catalogue entry of 1960 Knox observes that there is a connection between the two soldiers in this drawing and the figures of Alexander and his companion the fresco <i>The family of Darius before Alexander</i> that Tiepolo painted in the Villa Cordellina in 1743. The dress of the figures in the drawing differs from that of the final fresco. In the drawing Tiepolo studies Roman style and decoration. In the fresco this has been developed into an eighteenth-century classicised style, which incorporates elaborate drapery with contemporary hairstyles. However the posture and relationship of the two soldiers in the drawing is very close to that of the fresco. \n\nThe level of finish in the drawing is quite unusual for Tiepolo. This normally implies that the artist intended it to be worked from by assistants. The artist has used two tones of wash in the drawing, through the application of pure ink with a brush as well as watered down ink to achieve a paler wash. This effectively captures the fall of light and shade on the two figures. Knox notes that this technique was employed by the artist in the 1730s but is more unusual during the 1740s, when this work probably dates from.",
