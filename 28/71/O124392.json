It was published by Constable in English Landscape Scenery, number 2, January 1831. Constable, who was interested in the 'chiaroscuro of nature', or the effects of light and shade, chose mezzotint as the print medium for reproducing his work and asked Lucas to collaborate with him. Constable reworked the details to ensure that the image reproduced his ideas exactly.\n\nThis subject was begun in 1829, the same year as Constable made the oil sketch on which it is based. It was ready for printing in January 1830. In the second edition of English Landscape Scenery, 1833, Constable replaced it with another plate in which the terraces of Old Sarum were more strongly delineated.\n\nThe original oil sketch for this subject (Museum no. 163-1888) and a watercolour of it (Museum no. 1628-1888) are also in the V&amp;A's collection.",
