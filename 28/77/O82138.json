(See Appendix 3.) \n\n<b>Literature:</b> <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 37. \n\nThe backward-looking pose, deriving perhaps from Van Dyck\u2019s <i>Self-Portrait with a Sunflower</i>  (Trustees of the Duke of Westminster), can be explained - in the case of selfportraits - by the placing of a mirror at right-angles to the painter's easel. The awkwardness gives an idea of the inherent problem of self-portraiture, in which the holding of any pose is difficult, and the precise focusing of the eyes particularly so. These features here at least raise the possibility that the present miniature may be a self- portrait.\" \n\n",
