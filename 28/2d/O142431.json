Cooper, in his diary for that day, mentions reaching `the tents of some arabs of the tribe of the Jehesh'.  Their companions were Hormuzd Rassam, Dr. Humphrey Sandwith, and Stewart and Charlotte Rolland: see G. Waterfield, Layard of Nineveh, 1963, p.209.  \nSD252-269 relate to Layard's second expedition to excavate the ruins of ancient Nineveh in 1849-51: see his Discoveries in the ruins of Nineveh And Babylon; with travels in Armenia, Kurdistan and the Desert: being the result of a second expedition undertaken for the Trustees of the British Museum, 1853. \nCooper's diary for January-August 1850 was in the possession of a descendant, Mrs Irene Lyon Coldstream: see photocopy in the Searight Archive.  Other drawings from this expedition are in the BM, Department of Western Asiatic Antiquities.  An oil, Scene from the Excavations at Nineveh, 1852, was formerly with the Mathaf Gallery, London. \nSee also Layard, Sir Austen Henry, SD559. Layard, 1853; G.
