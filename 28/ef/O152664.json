            "public_access_description": "China produced many types of green-glazed wares, in shades ranging from olive to grass to grey-blue. Resembling jade, they were admired for their tranquil beauty. They were often used in Buddhist tea ceremonies and meditation rituals. \n\nAlthough some were made in northern China, green-glazed wares remained a speciality of the south. This funerary jar was produced at the Longquan kilns in Zhejiang province, and probably excavated from burials in the same area. Its olive tone is characteristic of Longquan ware of the 11th-12th century. \n\nGreen-glazed wares were exported in large quantities to South-east Asia and the Middle East. Later European collectors gave these wares the fanciful name of \u2018celadon\u2019.",
