            "public_access_description": "This pair of panels is made from inlaid decorative hardstone known as pietre dure. The technique of creating inlays from coloured stones was inspired by ancient Roman practice and was revived in the Renaissance following the archeological discoveries of ancient marbles.  Pietre dure appealed to seventeenth century interest in nature and science combining natural material, craftsmanship and design.\n\nThe panels represent a blossoming orange tree (Museum No. 810-1869) and a bouquet of flowers (Museum No. 810A-1869).  They are inlaid with intricate, polished pieces using a variety of marbles.  The orange tree panel features a pietre dure design on a textured neutral background that gives the impression of rolling landscape.  This natural pattern is formed organically from veins in the marble, which are exposed when it is cut. This type of stone is called pietre paesina, also known as \u2018landscape stone\u2019. This effective combination creates the illusion that the orange tree is sitting on an open loggia, also suggested by the beginning of a balustrade behind, creating the impression of looking onto a garden. The panel with the flowers shows a classically-inspired vase on a black background, suggesting that the vase is sitting in a fictive niche. It contains rare exotic flora: tulips and a central lily, reflecting the Medici interest in nature which began with Cosimo I.   Both inlaid panels create a sense of \u2018real\u2019 space to fool the eye, commonly known as a \u2018trompe l\u2019oeil\u2019. Such scenes of bountiful and stylised nature were common at this time, and the trompe l\u2019oeil adds a sense of being amongst nature, as was fashionable in villa adornment, reflecting health concerns and the benefits of taking fresh country air. Images such as these made visual links and continuities between the villa interior and the villa gardens. Medici interest in urban and rural landscaping, including garden design, was evident in the sixteenth century and continued into the seventeenth century, reflecting the importance of a healthy lifestyle amongst the Renaissance elite.     \n\nThe two panel frames vary slightly in their details. The corners of both feature Aquitaine marble in angular scrolls; the blue of the orange tree panel contrasts with the green Sicilian jasper and Sienese agate of the flower panel. These alternating and contrasting colours were employed to display the broad range of marbles used.  The panels were probably worked on over a number of years by several craftsmen in the Grand-Ducal workshops.",

            "history_note": "These two panels formed part of a larger set that decorated the walls of the Oratory built for the Medici family villa at Poggio Imperiale, just outside of Florence, where they were described in 1691 (New York 2008, p.178). They were situated in an alternating sequence with other examples and complemented by black marble wainscoting decorated with inlaid aquatic images in <i>pietra paesina</i> and framed with <i>pietre dure</i> (Florence-Chicago-Detroit 2002-03, pp. 264-5). The panels were made in the early seventeenth century in the Grand-Ducal workshops in Florence. The <i>Galleria dei Lavori</i> (later known as <i>Opificio delle Pietre Dure</i>), was established by Ferdinando I de\u2019 Medici in 1588 and specialised in hardstone work (Florence-Chicago-Detroit 2002-03 pp.5-6 and p.103).\n\nWhen the villa was renovated in the neoclassical style in the eighteenth century the Oratory was demolished and the panels put in storage (New York 2008, pp.178-9). The panels were subsequently given to the <i>Opificio delle Pietre Dure</i> where eleven panels were recorded in the 1789 inventory.  During the nineteenth century several panels were sold from the <i>Opificio\u2019s </i>collection and only two remain in the <i>Museo dell\u2019Opificio delle Pietre Dure</i>.  The Victoria and Albert Museum acquired its two panels at the 1867 Paris Exposition. \n\nThe examples at the <i>Museo dell\u2019Opificio delle Pietre Dure</i> closely resemble the vase of flowers panel at the Victoria and Albert Museum (New York 2008, pp.178-9).  Another similar panel is in the collection of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco.  The composition of the bouquet of flowers varies slightly in each panel. Similar vases of flowers motifs can be seen on a pietre dura table top in the Museum\u2019s own collection (Museum No. 449-1869) which also produced by the Grand-Ducal workshops.",
