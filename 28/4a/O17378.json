The white cliffs of Dover are one of the most well-known views in England - the first sight of the country for travellers by boat from continental Europe.  By this time, a tunnel had been constructed for the London-Dover railway, and of course in recent years Shakespeare's Cliff has assumed a new fame as the site of the construction of the Channel Tunnel, which physically links Britain with Europe for the first time since the Ice Age.  Although based on drawings made on the spot in 1849, the painting is a late work, and demonstrates Stanfield's assured handling of oil paint, particularly in the sky.",

Apprenticed to a heraldic painter in Edinburgh 1806, entered Merchant Navy 1808, Royal Navy 1812, discharged through illness 1814. Worked as scenery painter in London and Edinburgh theatres, painted panoramas and dioramas, as well as easel pictures. Exhibited 135 works at the RA between 1820 and 1867, 22 at the BI 1820-53, and 21 at the SBA 1824-29 (elected Member 1824, President 1829). Subjects almost all marine, river and coastal scenes. Elected to Sketching Society 1829, ARA 1832, RA 1835. Curator of Greenwich Hospital from 1844. Toured the Continent 1830 and 1838-9, and France 1832. Illustrated Heath's 'Picturesque Annuals' (1832, 1833, 1834), published 'Coast Scenery' 1836, and 'Sketches on the Moselle ... ' (1838). Friend of David Roberts RA and Charles Dickens. Died Hampstead, London, 18 May 1867. His son George Clarkson Stanfield was also an artist; his studio sales were at Christie's 8 May 1868 and 23 March 1876. Much admired by Ruskin, his skill at rendering both sea and sky - despite sometimes showing his theatrical interests too clearly - make him, after Turner, the most distinguished marine painter in Britain of the century. \nLIT: \tArt Journal 1857 , pp137-9; Gentleman's Magazine July 1867 (obit); J Dafforne Pictures by Clarkson Stanfield RA nd [1873]; P van der Merwe The Life and Theatrical Career of Clarkson Stanfield Bristol University PhD thesis 1979, and The Spectacular Career of Clarkson Stanfield Tyne and Wear County Council Museums exhibition catalogue 1979 (with bibliography) \nThe Seashore at Dover \n680-1893 \nCanvas, 42.6 X 62.9 cm (16 \u00be \u00d7 24 \u00be ins) Bequeathed by Miss E Anderson 1893 \n\nAccording to the museum files, the title of the work on acquisition was 'Dover - Shakespeare's Cliff. The view shows Dover before the erection of the Admiralty Pier. \n\nStanfield exhibited 'Shakespeare's Cliff, Dover, - 1849' at the RA in 1863 (272), which is possibly identifiable with the present work. Miss Anderson bequeathed the present work to the museum along with 'HMS \"Victory\" Towed into Gibraltar' (681-1893, below) and 'Shrimping' (6821893, p277). The executor of her will was Field Stanfield, the artist's son. Another version of the subject, signed and dated 1862, is in the National Maritime Museum (58.5 X 91.5 cm/23 X 36 ins), which is more probably the 1863 RA exhibit. \n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
