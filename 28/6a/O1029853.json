Bevan (son of the painter Robert Bevan), the art director Dicky Richards, and the artist John Gilroy, resulted in some of the most memorable posters ever produced. During Gilroy\u2019s long association with Arthur Guinness Son & Co. Ltd., he invented the famous Guinness menagerie of toucans, seals, ostriches, camels, giraffes, etc. \u2013 based on studies he made at the zoo. The campaigns also sought to associate Guinness with strength, so many of Gilroy\u2019s designs show prodigious feats of strength. Humour, too, played an important part. Slogans like \u2018Guinness is Good for You\u2019 and \u2018My Goodness My Guinness\u2019 became popular catchphrases.",
