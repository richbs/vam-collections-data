Fascinated by the traces of ancient remains, much of Underwood's work in the many different media he mastered is concerned with precisely observed landscape motifs, figures and other natural forms which he reworked with an almost mystical reverence. He first learned to etch in 1910 at the Royal College of Art as a student under Sir Frank Short, whose unromantic style he disliked; only when invited back to teach at the college, a decade later, did he begin to make prints in his own distinctive manner. Underwood's psychologically intense and compelling self-portrait as an artist in communion with nature also reveals something of the poetic fervour with which so many British artists of his generation approached the landscape.",
