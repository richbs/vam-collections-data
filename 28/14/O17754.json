            "public_access_description": "This circular relief in polychrome enamelled terracotta is made by Luca della Robbia, in Florence in ca. 1460-1470.\n\nThe style and composition relate to Ghiberti's second set of bronze doors for the Baptistery in Florence, the 'Gates of Paradise' (completed 1452), and it therefore probably dates from about 1460-1470. The central scene appears to have been modelled by Luca della Robbia and glazed in the della Robbia workshop. The border is cast not modelled, but is likely to be original.\n\nThe Della Robbia family was an Italian family of sculptors and potters. They were active in Florence from the early 15th century and elsewhere in Italy and France well into the 16th. Family members were traditionally employed in the textile industry, and their name derives from rubia tinctorum, a red dye. \nLuca della Robbia founded the family sculpture workshop in Florence and was regarded by contemporaries as a leading artistic innovator, comparable to Donatello and Masaccio. The influence of antique art and his characteristic liveliness and charm are evident in such works as the marble singing-gallery for Florence Cathedral. He is credited with the invention of the tin-glazed terracotta sculpture for which the family became well known.",
