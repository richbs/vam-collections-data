Marot worked periodically at the court of William and Mary in London, after they came to the British throne in 1688, but he was mainly active in the Netherlands. There he produced numerous designs for furniture, interiors and even gardens, from the late 1690s onwards. It now seems likely that most chairs of this type were made during the second quarter of the 19th century, when the Baroque style of the late 17th century became fashionable again. The excellent condition of the frame of this chair, lack of wear and the very 'flat' and inexpressive quality of the carving suggest that it was made during this period of revival.",
