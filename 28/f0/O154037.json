The identity of the figure in the main picture is not clear but could be Hendrik Witbooi (c.1825-1905) who also appears in a smaller picture on the left. Witbooi was a Chief of the Namaqua people, a subset of the Khoikhoi, a tribal group who lived in the region which later became Namibia. He led his people against German colonial rule. Hosea Kutako (1871-1970) also appears on the left. He was one of the early nationalist leaders who petitioned the United Nations against colonial rule. He was also the Leader of Hereroland from 1968-1970. Sam Nujoma, who appears at the bottom on the left, was a railway worker who became a freedom fighter and ultimately the first president of Namibia, democratically elected in the year of independence, 1990.\n\nThe '90 Years' refers to back to 1887 when indigenous peoples, coming under serious attack from German colonials, began to fight back in what came to be known as the Swaartbooi Revolt. Since then, until independence, native peoples have struggled against colonial oppression, first from Germany and then South Africa.\n\nThe photographer George Hallett came to Europe in 1970 where he met up with other South African exiles, such as Gavin Jantjes, who made many posters and screenprints protesting against the horrors of Apartheid.",
