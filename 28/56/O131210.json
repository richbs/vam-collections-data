The Iranian royal family began to wear European-style uniforms early in the 19th century. Muhammad Shah, who ruled from 1834 to 1848, is often depicted wearing one and seated on a European-style chair. Their military soon followed suit. This example survived in the collection of a Qajar prince who lived in a splendid villa in Monte Carlo for much of the 20th century. \n\nThe materials used in this uniform are characteristic of European military dress: dark woollen fabric with red piping and brass buttons. Indeed, the surviving buttons and brass buckle were all made in Europe. Yet in some of its features, notably the full pleated skirt of the coat, the cut of the uniform reflects local traditions of male dress. Thus this uniform illustrates the process by which elements of European modernity were adapted to local custom.",
