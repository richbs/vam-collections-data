With its sharply carved folds of drapery it bears some resemblance to the work of the Portuguese sculptor active in Spain, Manuel Pereira (1588-1683). St Bruno (about 1032-1101) was the founder of the Carthusian Order. Although never officially canonised, he is recognised as a saint, as the Holy See approved his cult for Carthusians in 1514, and this was extended to the Universial Church in 1674. He is usually portrayed in Carthusian habit holding a lily and with a skull.",
