Note: researchers may use the terms applique and tambour when searching for this category of textile even though they are incorrect.\nPieced, seams go through the embroidery. On the right hand side there are the remains of a red cotton binding.  A section of the resht  work has been folded to the back  and tacked in place with the binding on top of it; there are 4 metal hooks with evidence of a 5th one at the top; there is a very squashed hook on a scrap of red cotton at the bottom, by the Museum Number.  There is a seam down the right hand side, cutting through the embroidery.\nThe pattern is a series of horizontal bands.  From the bottom:\n[1] black band with a small section of grey felted wool.\n[2] orange ground with red leaves and white embroidery forming an undulating line either side of which are  rosettes and star shaped flowers which are randomly black or green with red berries and green tracery.\n[3] red band\n[4] Deep band.  Black ground with thick white embroidered meander with large, composite, multi-coloured blossoms and red and yellow pointed flowers and round flower; there are light blue leaves and lots of small white tendrils.\n[5] red band\n[6] as [2] but all the flowers except one are black; one on the right hand side is green\n[7] black band\n[8] pieced; red ground with seven and a half left-facing botehs.  Dark petals at the base and at the top with blue, purple and turquoise flowers and many white tendrils.\nThe seams are covered with red and white silk with a line of black and white silk between bands [7] and [8].\nEmbroidery thread: 2S silk: green, red, white, light blue, yellow.\nInset wool: black, red, orange, turquoise, dark blue, grey, light blue, purple.",
