Above this are two octagonal sections, the sides of each octagon concave, joined in the centre by a triple collar section abou17 cm in height, composed of three collars carved with vesica shapes with stepped sections between. Above and below these collars the shaft of the post is carved with upright leaf shapes and similar leaf shapes are carved at the top of the post where the post narrows before becoming wider again and square sectioned. The top of the block is cut at an angle and a slot is cut on the longest side of the block and is open at the top. In the centre of the top there is the remains of an iron spike or nail, at the back of that mortice or slot cut through the top of one side of the block. \n\nA modern mirror plate for display is attached to one side of the top block.  Two mirror plates are attached at the back of the lower square section.",
