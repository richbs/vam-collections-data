It is painted on the plain ivory-coloured ground of the paper and the flowers are painted in white and modelled in grey brush strokes. The stamens are painted in a bright pink with yellow anthers. The calyx at the base of the flower head is picked out in pink on a pale green stem with four inwardly curving leaves round it.  The modelling is largely done through brush strokes in darker tones and a small amount of loose hatching.\n      The picture has a gold line at its base and is framed with strips of dark grey paper with black outlines mounted on the ivory-coloured main border.  This has strips of sage green paper pasted on its margins with one black outline.  The inner edge of the page has a strip of beige woven textile attached to it acting as a gutter for the album binding.",

It contains 56 leaves on which are Mughal miniature paintings, drawing and flower studies on both sides. The binding is covered with an Indian brocade silk that may have been cut from lengths brought home by the 2nd Lord Clive, who served as Governor of Madras, 1799 to 1803.  The album was sold from Powis Castle at Sotheby's sale, 16 to 18 January 1956, lot 332A.",
