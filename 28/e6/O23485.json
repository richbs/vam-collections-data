The outlines for all the sections of a sleeveless, side-fastening jacket can be traced in the velvet, with two choices of collar as well as a pocket, a spectacle case and a gourd-shaped purse. The opposition of cut and uncut velvet delineates the cutting line for the tailor, an easy way of dressmaking but one that may not have guaranteed a perfect fit.",
