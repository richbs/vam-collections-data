The ample, full length skirt is gathered on to the bodice at hip level and is slightly fuller at the back.  The gauging is covered by a cross over sash of self material, the loop trimmed with a large artificial red rose at the bottom with a made up single loop bow.  These are attached on either side of the back zip.  The hem is faced with a wide band of self material.  The skirt is mounted over an under skirt of the same material similarly trimmed,  the hem is interlined with nylon stiffening.  Underneath this is a gathered pink nylon net petticoat, the back of the hem interlined with a double row of nylon net, the front with a single row.  The bodice is lined with white net, stiffened with bones and with wire undercup brassiere supports.  This fastens with hooks and eyes over which the dress zips.",
