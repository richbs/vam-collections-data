            "public_access_description": "This design is on a mise-en-carte or point paper.  The pattern had to be painted onto squared paper before it could be transferred to the loom. The point paper is ruled with large squares divided by smaller ones. The design is painted in bodycolour, opaque colours, and shows a red lace ribbon in a sinuous pattern overlaid with trailing flowers tied with bows. On the left side is a bunch of white flowers and a red and pink rose tied with a white ribbon arranged in a bow against a background of maroon stripes and sprigs. The stripes suggests a tobine or cannell\u00e9 effect, a weave with transverse ribs formed by warp floats with brocaded ribbon and flowers. In brocading, the action of the weaver carries the weft across one limited section of the warp. The point-paper is thus for a brocaded cannell\u00e9 silk to be made by L. Galy Gallien, Lyon, France in about 1760-70. \n\nThe back of this point paper is stamped 'ROBERT RUEPP / DESEINS [sic] / 7, Rue Berg\u00e8re, PARIS' for the name of the art nouveau designer who once owned it.\n\nThere are colour notes handwritten in pen and ink for almost all of the colours on the back of this point paper.  These are colour notes. The names of colours in the eighteenth century in France and also in Britain were sometimes specific to materials such as 'straw' and 'porcelain' or to flowers of plants such as 'amaranthus' which is pinkish purple.\n\nDesigns with lace ribbons came back into fashion after 1745 but their designs differ with sinuous lace ribbons like the one in this point-paper that when woven create an optical illusion of a real lace ribbon draped over the silk ground. They are punctuated by trailing, or bunches of, flowers that appear natural.",
