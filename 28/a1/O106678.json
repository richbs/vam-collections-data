He then travelled through Florence where he was persuaded to stay. He became sculptor to the Medici family and thus became one of the most influential sculptors of the late 16th and early 17th centuries. He drew attention to many artists  from Northern Europe and disseminated his style mainly through small bronzes. He established an efficient and large workshop.",
