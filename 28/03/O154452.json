The blade has a long, forward-pointed, inscribed, oval reserve, within which there is an engraved pattern of diamonds, each one of which is centred by an oval pierce shape. There are seven tiers of such holes and a pierced tip triangle. The handle is triangular in cross-section and has a centred silver spine plate to which are pinned the handle pieces.
