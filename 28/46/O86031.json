            "historical_context_note": "In ceramic production, compounds of copper and silver were used to create the shiny, metallic decoration known as lustre.  It was a two-stage process.  In the first stage, the glazed pot was produced in the normal way by firing in a kiln.  In the second, a design was painted over the glaze using the metallic compounds, and the pot was refired at a lower temperature in a kiln with a restricted supply of oxygen.  During this second firing, the heat converted the  metallic compounds into oxides, and the carbon monoxide produced by the fire then drew the oxygen out of the oxides, leaving the metal as a thin deposit on the vessel.  The result was a surface with an attractive golden glow.  Both these forms of decoration - blue-and-white and lustre - were to have a very long history, and they are both still in use today.\n\nThe designs of Safavid lustre owe nothing to the Chinese, but are purely Iranian.  Their source is not precisely identifiable, the motifs are a mixture of the sort of decoration found in contemporary manuscript illumination, see Pope (1939; pls 892-93, 896-98. 974-75 etc.) and designs developed specifically for ceramics, such as the arabesques and floral designs found on slip-painted wares (cat. U.25.U26). The relationship ends there though. The range of shapes, the materials and details of making indicate that it is a separate production.",
