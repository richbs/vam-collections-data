An early pair were supplied by the Jewel Office ( a state department storing, lending and  buying silver for officials ) to the Duke of Argyll in 1719. The first sauceboats were double-lipped, but forms which poured from one lip only became more popular after 1730. The sauce tureen appeared in about 1765 in response to the neo classical style and the fashion for vase shapes. Sauce tureens and sauceboats were often sold  in sets of four although one of the largest and grandest dinner services,  made for the Duke of Leinster  in 1745-1747,  contained ten sauceboats.\n\nPeople\nThe sauce tureen was made at Matthew Boulton's Soho factory in Birmingham. Boulton began to make silver in about 1766 to challenge the dominance of London and Paris in the market for high profile luxury goods. Silver and ormolu, largely made using traditional craft techniques, provided  loss leaders for his more substantial trade in buckles and other small steel wares and the Sheffield plate business. The design of these tureens proved popular. Mrs Montague, a leader of fashionable society, ordered identical tureens and was told by Boulton that he had  'never made any as rich before'.\n\nDesign\nThe sophisticated and assured design of the sauce tureen demonstrates an elegant but restrained use of neo classical ornament such as reed moulding, shallow fluting, scroll work frieze and pendant husks. It has been suggested that the architect, James Wyatt, who is known to have collaborated with Boulton, may have designed this tureen.",
