It belonged to her when she was a child and was bought for her by her father as a little treat, perhaps instead of some sweets or a comic. It was produced by Mattel and designed by Erin Libby in 1967.  \n\nThe doll inside, 'Liddle Kiddles' was produced by Matell in 1965 and first introduced at the New York Toy Fair. The person overseeing the project and founder, Elliot Handler, stated that he wanted the dolls to resemble little children in neighbourhoods across America. The title 'Liddle Kiddle' was taken from the words \"little kids\" and at only 3 inches tall, the dolls can be carried around in small pockets or put in perfume bottles.",
