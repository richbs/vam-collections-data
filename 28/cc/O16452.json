Chauncy Hare Townshend, as well as with the Victorian public in general.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nLandseer's choice of subject illustrates the Victorian obsession with the trappings of death, combined here with his speciality, the accurate and almost anthropomorphic representation of dogs and other animals. Its  mixture of pathos and realism appealed to all sections of society, and the critic Ruskin praised the fine technique and the subtle choice of details. This painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1837 and proved a great success, particularly as an engraving after this picture was published and sold widely in the following year.\n\nPeople\nEdwin Henry Landseer (1802-1873) was a child prodigy, exhibiting some drawings at the Royal Academy when he was only 13. From an early age he was a frequent visitor to the menagerie in Exeter Change in the Strand, London, where he drew lions, monkeys and other animals. Animals remained the main subjects of his art. Queen Victoria collected his paintings, as did John Sheepshanks. The two biggest collections of his work are in the Royal Collection and here in the Victoria and Albert Museum.",

Studied with BR Haydon, entered the RA Schools 1817 (at the age of 14); won annual prizes of the Royal Society of Arts 1813-17. A precocious and prodigious talent, as both painter and draughtsman, he exhibited - in a long and distinguished career - 179 works at the RA between 1815 and 1873, 94 at the BI 1818-65, and four at the SBA 1826-32. \nSubjects included portraits, but predominantly dealt with animal and human genre, often based in Scotland. Elected ARA 1826 (at the earliest permitted age), RA 1831. Received the patronage of the Russell family, and - most importantly- that of the Royal family, to whom he was Drawing Master, beginning in 1836 with the Duchess of Kent (Queen Victoria's mother); most significantly, he represented in visual form the Queen and Prince Albert's love for the life and landscape of the Scottish Highlands. Together with George IV's celebrated visit to Edinburgh 1822, and the great popularity of Sir Waiter Scott's Waverley novels, Landseer's contribution to the place of Scotland in European culture in the 19th century was considerable. The artist's own popularity was increased by the great number of reproductive prints after his works (Graves alone lists 434 by 126 engravers, see Lit below); his 'Monarch of the Glen' (exh, RA 1851), commissioned by the House of Lords but the cost refused by the House of Commons, was eventually bought by Sir Thomas Dewar and reproduced on his family firm's whisky bottle labels. Also significant was his anthropomorphic treatment of animals, particularly dogs; the <u>Art Journal</u> obituarist stressed that 'his dogs are not mere portraits only, they are thinking, almost rational, creatures, wanting only the gift of speech to hold converse with us'. Knighted 1850; offered PRA 1865, but refused, almost certainly because of his poor physical and mental health. Died London 1 October 1873; buried in St Paul's Cathedral. His studio sale was at Christie's 8-15 May 1874; a commemorative exhibition was held at the RA 1874/5. After the Royal Collection, the V&A possesses the largest holding of Landseer's works; there are a great many drawings and prints as well as the oils catalogued below, principally from the Sheepshanks Gift, one of the artist's most important patrons. \n\nLIT: F G Stephens <u>The Early Works of Sir Edwin Landseer RA</u> 1869; J Dafforne <u>Pictures by Sir Edwin Landseer </u>... 1873; <u>Art Journal </u>1873, p326 (obit); interleaved copy of 1874 RA exhibition catalogue, annotated by C S Mann, with photographs of prints after Landseer, 1874-7,4 vols (National Art Library, V&A); A Graves <u>Catalogue of the Works of the Late Sir Edwin Landseer</u> 1876; C Monkhouse entry in DNB; C Lennie Landseer: Victorian Paragon 1976; R Ormond <u>Sir Edwin Landseer</u> Philadelphia Museum of Art and Tate Gallery exhibition catalogue 1981 (With full bibliography).\n\n<b>The Old Shepherd's Chief Mourner </b>\nFA93 Neg 54050 \nCanvas, 45.7 X 61 cm (18 X 24 ins) Sheepshanks Gift 1857 \nExhibited at the RA in 1837. Admired by the <u>Athenaeum</u> critic as 'one of the most simply pathetic things in the Exhibition', the work became both famous and a popular success due to the 1838 engraving and Ruskin's eulogy in the first volume of <u>Modern Painters</u> published 1843. Ruskin cited the picture as illustrating his definition of 'Greatness in Art' and his belief that 'the greatest picture is that which conveys to the mind of the spectator the greatest \nnumber of the greatest ideas'. Ruskin thought it: \n\nOne of the most perfect poems or pictures (I use the words as \nsynonymous) which modern times have seen ... Here the exquisite \nexecution of the glossy and crisp hair of the dog, the bright sharp \ntouching of the green bough beside it, the clear painting of the wood of \nthe coffin and the folds of the blanket, are language -language clear and \nexpressive in the highest degree. But the close pressure of the dog's breast \nagainst the wood, the convulsive clinging of the paws, which has dragged the blanket off the trestle, the total powerlessness of the head laid close and motionless upon its folds, the fixed and tearful fall of the eye in its utter hopelessness, the rigidity of repose which marks that there has been no motion nor change in the trance of agony since the last blow was struck on the coffin-lid, the quietness and gloom of the chamber, the spectacles marking the place where the Bible was last closed, indicating how lonely has been the life, how unwatched the departure, of him who is now laid solitary in his sleep; - these are all thoughts - thoughts by which the picture is separated at once from hundreds of equal merit, as far as mere painting goes, by which it ranks as a work of high art, and stamps its author, not as the neat imitator of the texture of a skin, or of the fold of a drapery, but as the Man of Mind. \n\n'The Poor Dog', otherwise titled 'The Shepherd's Grave', may be seen as a forerunner of the present work; it was exhibited at the BI in 1829 (now private collection, see <u>Ormond</u> p104, repr). \nA sketchbook including a drawing for the present work (dated, presumably incorrectly, 1825 in the catalogue) was lot 1001 in the artist's studio sale at Christie's 8 May 1874; a sketch from the collection of the Marchioness of Londonderry was sold at Christie's 20 April 1885 (55), bought Nathan \u00a31 18s. \n\nEXH: RA 1837 (112); <i>International Exhibition</i> Dublin 1865 (19); <i>RA Bicentenary Exhibition</i> RA 1968-9 (231); <i>La Peinture Rornantique Anglaise et les Pre-raphaelites</i> Petit Palais, Paris, 1972 (155);<i> Great Victorian Pictures</i> Arts Council 1978 (25); <i>Zwei Jahrhunderts Englische Malerei </i>1979-80 (364); Tate 1982 (66) \n\nENGR: BP Gibbon 1838; Frederick Hollyer 1869; G SHunt 1884, as pl 87 of <i>Works of Sir Edwin Landseer</i> RA (first series 1881-93); lithograph Jacob Bell \n\nLIT: <u>Athenaeum</u> 6 May 1837, p330;<u> Literary Gazette </u>13 May 1837, p306;<u> Blackwood's Magazine</u> September 1837; <u>Stephens</u>, p58 (repr pl 13); <u>Dafforne</u>, ppl6-7; <u>Cornhill Magazine</u> 1874, p87; Mann I, pp 134-5a;<u> Graves</u> no 233; T H Ward <u>English Art</u> in <u>the Public Galleries of London </u>nd [1888], p165 (repr): ] Manson Sir Edwin <u>Landseer </u>1902, pp89-91 (repr): G Reynolds <u>Victorian Painting </u>1966, pIS, 20, 27 (repr pl 8); <u>Lennie</u>, pp83, 91, 130-1, 133, 149; R Treble <u> Great Victorian Pictures</u> Arts Council exhibition catalogue 1978, p47; <u>Ormond</u>, pll0 \n\n\nRonald Parkinson\"\nRichard Ormond, <u>Monarch of the Glen: Landseer in the Highlands</u>.

It was painted in 1837, the year the young Queen ascended to the throne, together with a less well known companion picture <i>The Shepherd's Grave</i>, showing the same dog continuing to grieve at his master's last resting place, just as the famous Edinburgh dog Greyfriars Bobby was to do in real life.\n \nIt is easy to enumerate the qualities in <i>The old Shepherd's Chief Mourner</i> which so appealed to the contemporary Victorian public, who eagerly purchased engravings of the picture which became one of the best loved prints of the century. Every detail of the composition develops a different thread of the story, successfully combining the themes of rustic piety, honourable but obscure old age, the dignity of rural poverty, and above all the value of loyalty and fidelity, expressed in the dog's devotion to his master. Most contemporary critics analysed the painting in this way, notably John Ruskin in a famous eulogy of the work in <i>Modern Painters</i> in 1843, in which he described it as 'one of the most perfect poems or pictures (I use the words as synonymous) which modern times have seen'. But it is more interesting to try to understand why the Victorians cared so much about dogs. England is, and remains a nation of animal lovers, and was the first country to establish a society for the prevention of cruelty to animals, in 1824. The dog, the animal closest to man, was central to this concern, and Landseer's works perfectly expressed it in pictorial terms.\n \nHe was to paint many more famous 'doggy' pictures in the years immediately after <i>The old Shepherd's Chief Mourner,</i>notably <i>Dignity and Impudence</i> and <i>A Distinguished Member of the Humane Society</i>. Although their anthropomorphic qualities - the association of human attitudes with canine behaviour - have at times been severely criticized, they have never completely lost their appeal, and recent exhibitions have confirmed the outstanding ability of Landseer as an animal painter. \n\nLionel Lambourne\"",
