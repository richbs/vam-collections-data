It is, in fact, much closer to Regency silver and furniture design than to mainstream ceramic production at that time, as it was almost certainly designed by the great Regency furniture designer and upholsterer George Bullock (died 1818), and was probably intended to complement furnishings supplied by him. Bullock designed similar chamber sets for the use of Napoleon and his officers in exile on the island of St Helena in 1815. Interestingly, those originally intended for the defeated Emperor's personal use were never sent to the island, as the painted leaf decoration was considered too 'redolent of the victor's laurels'. The set is from Woburn Abbey, the ancestral home of the Dukes of Bedford, and it may have been specially commissioned by one of the Dukes. English ceramics designed by architects or interior designers are exceptionally rare before about 1840.",

However, the sale also included pieces with the same provenance that are most unlikely to have been made by Enoch Wood. The attribution to Bullock is based on 1) the existence of similar wares designed by him for Napoleon's personal use at St Helena, and to similar wares for the officers use in Bullock's St. Helena designs; 2) on the similarity to silver designs by Bullock; and 3) on the chamber set's own provenance, as Woburn Abbey included a large group of furniture by or attributable to Bullock. Jonathan Horne suggested that the set was probably made for John, the 6th Duke of Bedford (d. 1839), and that it was intended for use at Endsleigh House in Devon. However, the man in the portrait medallion is very similar in appearance to Francis, the 7th Duke of Bedford (1788-1861), who married Anna Maria Stanhope (1783-1857) in 1808.",
