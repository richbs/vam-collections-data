The Neo-classical refinement, involving an elongation of the bowl and high, looped handle (in contrast to the more robust, sculpted handles of the 17th century), was partly facilitated by the production of thinner sheet metal on mechanised rolling mills. From the 1790s, versions were made both in silver and Sheffield plate.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe surface decoration of these pieces was usually minimal. Formal engraving was often used on silver pieces, but on Sheffield plate, although it was possible, there was often the risk of cutting through the silver surface and exposing the copper beneath. Engraving was therefore often avoided altogether, and decoration was restricted to such details as a beaded rim, as in this case.",
