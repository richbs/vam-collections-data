She is in a very revealing rural costume in a sexually provocative pose  reclining against a tree. Behind her sitting in the branches of the tree is a man (the actor Shashi Kapoor) dressed in white looking down at her. This is perhaps alluding to the classic religious imagery of Krishna, Radha and the Gopis and the story of Krishna stealing the Gopis clothes and hiding in a tree nearby watching as they bathed in the river. The title is in the right hand corner in colours of yellow, orange and red which are reflected in the female costume. The typography is large and distinctive. 'Love sublime' is written below the title. The Raj Kapoor film studio logo is just above the main title.",
