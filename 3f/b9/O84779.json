They considered flat stylised patterns, of the kind seen in this design, more suitable for decorating walls than figurative or naturalistic patterns with shadows and the illusion of depth. This was because they thought that figurative subjects, or those which imitated reality by using perspective and shading, were creating a false impression on a flat surface. The majority of consumers, however, favoured the more traditional styles which were also for sale during this period. \n\nThis is a design for intended for both a wallpaper and a textile. The wallpaper manufacturers Essex & Co.bought this design as it is, but the firm of Newman, Smith & Newman, who printed cotton textiles, bought the same design without the bird.",
