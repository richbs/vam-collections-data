Starting from the lower border, the design includes a low arcade containing swans; a bearded man in ruff and hat, doublet and breeches of patterned material, standing with his hands on his hips in front of the door of his house, and to either side is a hound and an attendant with a hooked hawk on his wrist, above them is the roof of the house with tall chimneys and dormer windows and a peacock perching on either end, and there is a tree on top of which sits an owl; the owl separates the scene where hunting dogs leap upon stags to either side of a flowering plant, above this is a large tree separating the mirror image of the man riding his horse, a horn in one hand and a drawn sword in the other, and above him in the tree are squirrels and monkeys; a narrow register above contains rabbits confronting a flowering plant, and below is the repeated register with swans.\n\nBorder on three sides contains birds and foliage in a meandering lattice. In one corner of the cloth is embroidered 'II W'.",
