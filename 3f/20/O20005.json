Some Company paintings were specially commissioned, while others were virtually mass-produced and could be purchased in bazaars. \n\nThis Company painting is part of an album, now known as the Gentil Album, of 58 paintings commissioned by a French infantry colonel, Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Gentil (1726-1799), who served under Shuja ud-Daula of Oudh from 1774 until 1786. Shah Jahan and his peacock throne are depicted here. The throne was removed to Persia by Nadir Shah in 1738/9 and subsequently broken up.",
