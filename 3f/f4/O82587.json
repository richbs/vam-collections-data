It is described in her will as \u201cthe upright and large picture of \u2018Trees at Hampstead\u2019 which is sometimes called \u2018The path to Church\u2019\u201d.\nHampstead Parish Church is just visible on the extreme left of No. 223 [1630-1888].  The painting is unfinished in some details, for example at the foot of the fence on the right.\nHolmes, p. 245, dates c. 1821.  Shirley (L. ed. S., pp. 116 and 117) tentatively identifies No. 223 [1630-1888] with the painting mentioned by Constable in his letter of 20 September 1821 to Fisher: \u201cAnd independent of my <i>jobs</i> I have done some studies, carried further that I have yet done any, particularly a natural (but highly Elegant) group of trees.  Ashes, Elms, and Oaks etc which will be of quite as much service to me as if I had bought the feild and Hedge Row, which contains them.  and perhaps one time or another will fetch as much for my children.  It is rather larger than a kitcat & upright\u201d.  The kitcat size is 36 x 28 ins. and No. 223 [1630-1888] differs from it only in being \u00bd in. wider, so the statement about size hardly applies, but in style and subject the identification is plausible.  If it be accepted, the further suggestion made by Key, p. 61, that the picture was one of Constable\u2019s exhibits at the Royal Academy in 1822, No. 314 \u2018A Study of Trees from Nature\u2019, may well be correct.  The position of this exhibit indicates that it was an oil.\nEvans, M., with N. Costaras and C. Richardson, <u>John Constable.
