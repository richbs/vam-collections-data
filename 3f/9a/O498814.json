Signed 'Zhu Chengming zhi'(made by Zhu Chengming), Chinese. Ming dynasty.\nResearch by Maria Fabrizi-Feb.1988: This box carries a mark on the underside of the base, which has been covered with gilding. This mark is an area that is otherwise plain yellow-brown metal. The interior surface is also of this apperence. There seem to be signs of turning or a similar process, perhapes used for finishing the object, and some probable porosity is evident. The walls of the box are partly gilted on the exterior, and the rest is dark and rather granular in apperence. It shows signs that the blackish material has been deliberately applied, and that it might be paint or lacquer. 2727A-1856 is the lid. The treatment is very similar, particularly in that there are gilded decorative elements, with blackish granular areas in between. Interior surfaces show plain yellow-brown metal, and there are signs of porosity, a casting flaw, and a repair in one side that shows as a faint crack on the outside. There seems to be evidence of turning, and there is very little in the way of obvious corrosion.\nAnalyses were carried out, using non-intrusive EDXRF methods. For each part, the black area, the gilding, and the bare metal were all investigated. Qualitative results for the gilding showed that it contained gold and mercury. In other words, fire-gilding had been carried out. Weight percentage figures showed  that the box and lid had been made from different materials, since there was such a wide gap between their zinc contents. The alloys were essentially made of copper and zinc, with very small amouts of other metals such as lead and tin. These brasses did not indicate by their composition how they had been made, since the zinc content was not over 28%. Therefore, either the cementation process, or mixing of the metallic elements, could have taken place.",
