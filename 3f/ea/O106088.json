At a time when many men idealised women, her performance as the Sylph became a symbol of ideal womanhood - feminine, spiritual, ethereal and unattainable. \nTaglioni's costume for the Sylph - a low-necked, calf-length, bell-shaped diaphanous dress - became the 'uniform' for ballet dancers.  In fact, in cut and shilouette, the dress is based on fashionable dress of the 1830s and 1840s and details, like the bodice cut and waistline, change with fashion until the dress 'crystallises' in the late 1840s into the dress that is recognised as a 'ballet dress' today. \nThe peacock feather decorations are curious, as peacock feathers are generally regarded as unlucky in the theatre, the 'eye' shape linking them to the Evil Eye.",

Printing early pulls in a run with 'Proof' was a way of making them more attactive to print collectors, although they have no extra merit over any other pull in the run.",
