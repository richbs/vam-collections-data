The lengths, known as waistcoat shapes, were purchased at a silk mercers or haberdashers, then taken to a tailor for making up into a waistcoat. \n\nThe stamp seen on the inside of the lower right edge reads \u2018Custom House / SEIZED DOVER / GR II\u2019, indicating that this  is contraband \u2013 a French waistcoat shape apprehended during an attempt to smuggle it into England during the reign of George II (1727\u201360). For most of the 18th century, imported French silks and laces were taxed heavily, in order to protect British textile industries. Smuggling of these and other taxable goods was rife through all levels of society; customs officials at British ports searched very carefully and seized any contraband items. Articles confiscated in this manner were usually burned, so the survival of this beautiful but forbidden object is indeed remarkable.",

'The Physical Manifestation of an Abstraction: A Pair of 1750s Waistcoat Shapes', <i>Textile History</i>, 39:1, May 2008, pp. 92-104\nThe abstract reads: A pair of tamboured French waistcoat shapes in the V&A's collection bears Customs stamps from the reign of George II. Examination of both the garment and Customs records held by the National Archives reveals the illegal commerce in textiles in eighteenth-century Britain, and the reasons why such goods were taxed or banned. The political, social, administrative and fashion contexts of textile smuggling are discussed, as well as its numerous methods of execution, allowing speculation on the exact progress of the waistcoat shapes from embroiderer's workshop to museum storeroom.\nHart, Avril and Susan North, Historical Fashion in Detail: The 17th and 18th Centuries, London: V&A Publications, 1998, p. 106",
