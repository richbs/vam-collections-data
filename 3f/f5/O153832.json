She could leap up to five feet in the air, as referenced by the photography on this poster. She based much of her early performance on the work of black writers and racial issues, later drawing on subjects from a variety of black cultures and figures, ranging from African stonecutters to Caribbean religious practices to rural life in the American South. Her company's performance in Dark Rhythms had two themes: African male rituals, and Primus' experience as a black American.",
