The back of the cover is woven in the technique \"roseng\u00e5ng\" (the wefts are continous and do not turn at the edge of a motif), 'rose path', named after the pattern the weaving resembles. This type of design is frequently copied in the 20th century (and still) by local handicraft association, as it is so representative of earlier work",
