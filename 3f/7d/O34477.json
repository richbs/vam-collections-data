British photographer John Davies's rural and urban landscapes, in the precise style of documentary photography, capture the opposing elements of nature and culture where they converge. he has said: \"I am documenting the major post industrial cities of Britain and making images of the central urban environments, especially areas which attract people. My aim is to produce a coherent set of images which reflect the positive achievements and realities within our continually changing urban space. I wish to remain objective in this documentary work but a theme that has become increasingly important to me is to question as well as celebrate our collective responsibility in shaping the environments in which we live.\"",
