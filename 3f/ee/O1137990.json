            "public_access_description": "This mosaic representing Giotto is part of a cycle of monumental mosaic portraits depicting famous artists. The series of originally 35 mosaics was created between 1864 and circa 1875 for the South Court of the South Kensington Museum, the later V&A. The mosaics were originally installed on the side walls as part of a decorative scheme celebrating the arts. It is made after a painting by John Callcott Horsley R.A.\n\nA Florentine painter and architect, Giotto di Bondone (1267-75 -1337) more than any other artist may be said to have determined the course of painting in Europe. Giotto turned from the formulas of Byzantine painting to the study of nature, achieving lifelike, expressive faces and the illusion of volume and space. Among the greatest works of Italian art are the 38 frescoes in the Scrovegni Chapel, Padua (begun ca.1305); these scenes from the life of the Virgin, the life of Christ, the Last Judgement and Virtues and Vices illustrate Giotto's dramatic sense and power of narration. He achieved a remarkable representation of space without using a system of perspective.\n\nHorsley depicts the great founder of Italian Renaissance painting as a young shepherd, holding his crook and drawing with a stick on a flat stone. The story of the discovery of Giotto by Cimabue is one of the best known episodes in Giorgio Vasari's Lives of the Artists. Giotto was born in Vespignano, outside Florence, the son of an agricultural labourer. While looking after his father's sheep, he would draw - on flat stones or on the ground - with a sharp stick. Cimabue was travelling from Florence on business when he came across the youth drawing, with 'no master but Nature'; amazed, he took Giotto to live and work with him.\n\nJohn Callcott Horsley (1817-1903) was born at Brompton, the son of the organist and composer William Horsley, and great-nephew of Sir Augustus Wall Callcott RA. He studied at Sass's art school and the RA Schools, and afterwards painted portraits, literary and historical subjects, domestic genre and rural genre scenes. He exhibited 121 works at the RA between 1839 and 1896, and was elected ARA in 1855 and RA in 1864. Horsley won prizes in the competitions for the decoration of the Palace of Westminster in 1843, 1844 and 1847. Some of his works were engraved; he also contributed etchings to the publications of the Etching Club and drawings to Punch, and in 1843 he designed the first Christmas card. He was associated with the artist's colony at Cranbrook, Kent, where he bought a house in 1858. At the RA, he was Rector 1875-90 (his campaign against the use of naked models in life classes earned him the soubriquet 'Clothes-Horsley'), Treasurer 1882-97, and initiator and organiser of the first Winter Exhibitions of old masters.\n\nThe series of mostly idealised portraits against gold backgrounds soon became known by the public as the Kensington Valhalla. The term alludes to the Vallhall as eternal home of heroes in Norse mythology. It also refers to the concept of a reunion of outstanding personalities of different periods by the means of art. An earlier example of such a hall of fame is the Walhalla near Regensburg in Germany (opened in 1842).\n\nThe selection of the Kensington Valhalla includes many famous artists, from Phidias and Apelles as representatives of ancient Greece to contemporaries such as the Irish painter William Mulready who had died only five years before his mosaic was completed. \n\nMosaics played an important part in the canon of materials and techniques used for the interior decoration of the new South Kensington Museum. The ambitious project of a revival of the art of mosaics involved one of the major Venetian mosaic companies of the time, Salviati & Co. It also led to the innovation of the technique by the introduction of vitrified ceramics mosaics made by Minton, Hollins & Co. These ceramics mosaics were created following the cartoons of professional artists by female students, including members of the family of Henry Cole. \n\nThe Kensington Valhalla remained in place until 1949. Some of the mosaics are now on display in other galleries of the museum. In addition to the mosaics themselves, preparatory sketches and cartoons by established contemporary artists such as Edward Poynter or Lord Leighton are part of the V&A collection.",

            "history_note": "This mosaic was created for the decoration of the South Court of the Museum. It is part of a cycle of mosaic portraits of famous artists. They were created between 1863 and ca. 1875 and installed in blind arcades on the upper level of the South Court. \n\nVasari relates in his <i>Le Vite de' pi\u00f9 eccellenti pittori, scultori, e architettori</i> or <i>Lives of the Most Excellent Italian Painters, Sculptors, and Architects</i>, which were first published in 1550 in Florence, that Giotto was a shepherd boy.\n\nHistorical significance: Only few extensive mosaic cycles were executed in the 19th century. Apart from the <i>South Kensington Valhalla</i> the mosaics of the Albert Memorial, Albert Memorial Chapel at Windsor, and at Saint Paul's Cathedral, all begun in 1864, were the only other comparable projects of the time. All of them were made by Salviati & Co.\nThe mosaics of the <i>South Kensington Valhalla</i> are based upon designs of a variety of artists, some of whom were, or were to become, major figures of the Victorian art world. The commission is extremely well documented. The related documents and cartoons at the V&A make this cycle of mosaics not only an outstanding group of artistic value, but are also an excellent case study for the history of the buildings of the Museum.\n\nHorsley's source for the artist's physical appearance is probably the portrait attributed by some historians to Uccello on a cassone panel known as 'The Founders of Florentine Art', now in the Louvre. Although Horsley has idealised the facial features, a resemblance to the cassone image is evident.",

            "historical_context_note": "The Museum played an important part in the revival of mosaic in Britain in the 19th century. The technique goes back to ancient times and was always regarded as one of the most precious and long-lasting techniques for adorning walls and floors. The enormous costs of mosaics limited its success in the 19th century.\nThe early mosaics for the South Court were made using the traditional material glass. They were created by the Venetian company Salviati & Co., the most successful mosaic makers of the time who had branches in London and New York. The majority of the mosaics consist of vitrified ceramics which were provided by the English company Minton, Hollins & Co. The Mosaics were made by the Mosaic Class of the Art School of the South Kensington Museum and were supervised by a representative of Minton. Amongst the students were family members of Henry Cole.\nA second, less ambitious series of mosaics was created for the north cloister between 1868 and 1874. In 1878 a ceramic mosaic memorial for Sir Henry Cole, designed by Frank Moody was installed on the first landing of the Ceramic Staircase and is still in place today. The use of mosaic at the museum also included marble mosaic floors, some of them laid by 'Female Convicts' of Woking Prison from 1869 and was dubbed <i>Opus Criminale</i> by contemporaries.",
