ISBN 1851774041\nBalthasar II von Hohenlandenberg was the brother of Hugo, Bishop of Constance (see no.52). His shield is simpler than his brother's, not being quartered with Constance, but is surmounted by helmets with the crests of the united houses of Landenberg and Greifensee and scrolled mantling with the colours of the two families. From the Landenberg crest is suspended the Order of the Fish and Falcon, which Balthasar had been admitted to in 1492, and his status is confirmed by the inscription above: <font -i>'her balthser vn landenberg ritter'</font -i> ('Balthasar von Landenberg, knight'). As in a number of other panels from the Zeiner workshop, there are small figures in the spandrels of the archway, in this case men-at-arms holding pike and halberd, and the richly attired lady seen here was a popular type of secular heraldic supporter in Swiss panels of around 1500.\nThis panel must be contemporary with that of Hugo von Hohenlandenberg and probably comes from the same building. It shares the assured, crisp drawing style and extraordinarily delicate detail of the bishop's panel - note especially the headdress and jewellery of the female figure - manifested only in the finest works made for a wealthy elite.
