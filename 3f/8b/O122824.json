Sarah Siddons was the youngest of the actor Roger Kemble's twelve children and spent her formative years with the family theatre company, travelling up and down the country.  The family's first appearance at Drury Lane Theatre in the 1775 to 1776 season was not a success but when she appeared there again as Isabella in The Fatal Marriage, she was celebrated as the perfect noble tragic heroine, creating a legend that lasted until her retirement in 1812.\n\nDuring her lifetime Mrs. Siddons was painted by most of the great painters of the day, both in costume, and as here, in day dress. Before the days of photography, miniatures were an extremely popular and portable form of portraiture and were often provided with satin-lined leather cases to contain them for travelling.",
