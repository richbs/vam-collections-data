This may be Gibson's earliest bust, probably executed a few years after his arrival in Rome in 1817. According to myth, Helen was the daughter of Zeus who in the guise of a swan had seduced Helen's mother Leda. Helen hatched from an egg, indicated in this bust by the eggshell seen on her head. \n\nGibson (1790-1866) was apprenticed to Messrs Franceys, the Liverpool firm of statuaries and later removed to Rome where he received instruction from Canova and Thorwaldsen. Elected A.R.A in 1833 and RA in 1838. He became the leading English sculptor of his generation working in the neo-classical style and was famous for such works as the Tinted Venus, Pandora, Mars and Cupid and Psyche and Zephers. He also executed public statues and busts. He bequeathed his property on his death to the Royal Academy.",
