The gift was accompanied by books by the same person.\n\nl\n\nHistorical significance: CATTLE OF WOODEN PEGS\nWooden animals were the oldest and most popular traditional toys of Estonian peasant children.  To pasture cows and sheep was children's job in old Estonian villages.  While looking fter real cattle the children made a toy herd for themselves to play with.  They cut animals of branches of trees.  The system was simple and similar all over Estonia.  Only the most important features of the animal were marked.  All aminals have four legs, therefore the legs were not important.  But cows and oxen had horns - so the horns were cut to the stick.  Pigs were round and had snouts.  Horses were distinguished from the other animals by their upright necks.  Horse as the most important animals were sometimes made bigger and they got legs and even tails and manes.\n\n(Details given by the donor)",
