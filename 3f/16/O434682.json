This dries to give a lightweight but very strong core, which is removed from the mould and then subjected to the standard process of lacquering. The profile of the core is determined by that of the mould, which being made from wood, clay or plaster, can be freely shaped and modelled. Dry lacquer allows almost unlimited experimentation in the creation of new forms and is much more flexible in this respect than standard woodworking or basket-making techniques.",

While an appreciation of simple forms and plain monochromes has long been part of the Japanese aesthetic, there is no doubt that modernist tendencies in Japan have also been a significant factor.",
