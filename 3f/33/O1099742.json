London: The Stationery Office, 1997.\nCat.87, pp.162-163. Full Citation:\n\n<b>\u201cSamuel Cooper's Pocket Book' \n</b>\nGraham Reynolds' account of the so-called Pocket Book, (1) with his attribution of four of the miniatures to Samuel Cooper, has resolved a long-standing debate. Briefly, the entire set was acquired by Edwin Durning Lawrence from an unknown source, as by Cooper. The Redgraves, working on the 1862 South Kensington exhibition of miniatures, at first accepted this attribution with reservations, but eventually suggested Flatman. Williamson, on the basis of costume-dating and the inscription <i>My Father Rosse</i> on Cat. No. 137, gave them all to S P Rosse. Goulding agreed. Foster, expressing doubts, kept up the Cooper-Flatman claim; Long and Winter (2) followed Williamson, and it was only, as Reynolds relates, when the set was broken up for separate framing in the early 1970s that the different hands evident in the individual portraits were noticed. Entries for the four now attributed to Cooper (Cat. Nos 88-91), the nine attributed to Rosse (Cat. Nos 137-9, 141-6), and the one Anonymous (Cat. No. 204) appear here separately under the name of the appropriate artist, but physically the set itself is once again reunited and presented together with the wallet in the manner, as far as possible, of its transmission to us. \n\n1 Reynolds 1975. \n2 MS note in department files.\n\n<b>87 The Pocket Book</b>\n460-1892 \n\nThe following is Reynolds' description; (1) which incorporates a technical description of the binding by John Harthan. \n\nThis consists of 188 pages of laid paper, (2) all blank with these exceptions: \nPage 1 verso, which is inscribed in a nineteenth-century hand in blue chalk: \n<i>Samuel Cooper's /Pocket Book / This celebrated Artist / was born in London /1609 died in London 1672 / buried in Pancras Church</i>, and, at the top, in pencil: <i>18 miniatures</i>, and in the centre (upside down): <i>15 EDI</i> (?). \n\nPage 3 is inscribed in pencil in a late seventeenth-century or early eighteenthcentury hand, perhaps the same as that on nos 7, 12 (3): <i>Sr Peter Lely's son</i>. A tear in the centre of this page suggests that an inserted drawing or miniature has been extracted. \n\nThe sheets of paper are bound into a wallet with a lip which laps over the fore-edge and fixes onto the cover with a silver clasp. \n\nIt is bound in red morocco decorated with an overall 'fanfare' design of interlacing ribbons, with the compartments filled with <i>pointill\u00e9</i> ornament and the whole enclosed by roll- borders of varying width. This binding and the clasp are to be assigned to the late seventeenth or more probably the early eighteenth century. The marbled endpapers are not contemporary with \nthe binding, but a later insertion of the second half of the eighteenth century, or the nineteenth century. Inside the front cover is the bookplate of Edwin H Lawrence, who sold the book and its \ncontents to the Museum. \n\nThe inscription on page 3 cannot have been written earlier than 1680, when Lely was knighted. The pencil inscription on page 1 implies that there were at one time more than the fourteen miniatures purchased in the wallet and this, taken in conjunction with page 3, suggests that one of those missing was of Lely's son. \n\n1 Reynolds 1975, pp. 19-20, no. 15, pl. 1. \n2 Watermarked with several of the Dutch Pot marks of c.1680, but the marks are severely cut. \n3 The numbers are those assigned by Reynolds nos 7 and 12 are Cat.
