The writing is not, however, certainly seventeenth-century, and may be that of the re-framer, perhaps c.1865. Long (1) read the inscription as: '<i>?Bonsal yard at Mr Peter(?)lnches (?) ?lnefris?

II, p. 103, no. 86; Long 1929, p. 128; Long 1930, p. 18, fig. 4b (correctly as \u2018<i>A Gentleman</i> by N. Dixon'); <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 16; Murdoch 1981 , p. 154, fig. 165.\n\nThis miniature was actually purchased by the Museum as a possible self-portrait by the artist 'J Dixon', but the identification was abandoned almost at once, even before the confusion about Dixon was finally resolved. 'J Dixon' and 'Nathaniel Dixon' were forms of the artist's name that were current before Goulding and Collins Baker published the documents which established Nicholas Dixon's true identity and professional status. (2) The forms \u2018J\u2019 or 'John' originate from Walpole, who misinterpreted a passage of Vertue that refers to the pastel artist and perhaps pupil of Lely, John Dixon, who died c.1721 in Norfolk. (3)\n\nThe inscription, even if it were certainly seventeenth-century, is not legible enough to provide evidence by itself for the date of the portrait, though 1665 would be quite possible. Although the costume would be right for the mid-1660s, Dixon's work was much closer to that of Cooper at that time. Here, there is a wiriness and lack of blending in the drawing of the features, suggestive of the stylistic developments of the next decade, when Dixon was established as the leading Court miniaturist in his own right and became increasingly loose and careless in his drawing. \n\n1 MS note in departmental files. \n2 Goulding 1911 . \n3 Goulding 1914-15, p. 26; Long 1929, p. 127.\" ",
