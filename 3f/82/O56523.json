The frame made for this portrait is a good example of the British Neo-classical style.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nEdward Howard was the son of Lord Philip Howard. In 1764, in the course of his travels in Italy, Edward commissioned Pompeo Batoni (1708-1787) to paint his portrait. Frequently, the backgrounds in portraits of Grand Tourists included identifiable Roman antiquities, and here Batoni has inserted the ruined Temple of Vesta.\n\nPeople\nAt that time Batoni was the most celebrated painter in Rome, and one of the most famous in Europe. For nearly 50 years he made portraits of Rome's visitors. He was equally gifted as a history painter, as well as being internationally known for his religious and mythological paintings. On completion of this portrait in 1766, he sent it to Edward Howard in Britain, who had returned home in 1764.  It was finally mounted in an elaborately-carved British frame surmounted by an oval with a relief of Minerva and Cupid, very much in the decorative manner of Sir William Chambers (1723-1796), an influential architect and designer in the Neo-classical style.",

London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, p. 20-21, cat. no. 16A\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"Pompeo BATONI (1708-87) \n<i>Italian (Roman) School</i> \nBorn at Lucca, he moved to Rome in 1727, where he was influenced by the antique and by Raphael and Annibale Carracci, and, among contemporary painters, particularly by Masucci, Luti, Trevisani and Imperiali. He was elected to the Academy of St Luke in 1741. In his early years he painted altar-pieces and allegories, but from c. 1740 he concentrated on portraits of foreign visitors to Rome, in which field his fame rivalled that of Mengs. \n\n16A \nEDWARD HOWARD (1744-67), WITH \nHIS DOG, LEANING AGAINST A PARAPET \nOVERLOOKING THE ROMAN CAMPAGNA \nInscribed (I) on the parapet, right \n<i>POMPEO BATONI PINXIT \nROMAE ANNO 1766</i> \n(2)  lower right <i>Edward Howard \n      Esqr. 2nd son of the Honble \n      Phillip Howard Esqr.</i> \n(3)  lower left <i>Pompeo Batoni</i>  \n<i>Canvas</i> \n54\u00be X 40 (139 X 101.5) in an\nelaborately carved contemporary \nEnglish frame surmounted by an oval \nwith a relief of Minerva and Cupid \nW.36-1949\n \nEdward Howard was the son of Lord Philip Howard, who was the brother of Edward Howard, 9th Duke of Norfolk. He is recorded in Florence in a document of December 1763 and may be identified with the 'Mr Howard' mentioned in an unpublished journal as being in Rome in May 1764 (information supplied by Brinsley Ford). David Garrick describes him in complimentary terms in a letter from Italy dated 25 June 1764: 'We lived in the same house with Mr Howard and Mr Langdale - I think it was lucky they travelled together - the first is a very worthy good natured Young Man .. .' (<i>The letters of David Garrick</i>, ed. D. M. Little and G. M. Kahrl, i, 1963, p. 420). Although it is not clear from the letter, this probably refers to Rome, where the Garricks stayed in March-April 1764. In any case Howard's Italian journey is documented for 1763-64 and it appears likely that he sat for this portrait in 1764 even though, as the inscription indicates, it was not completed until 1766. Batoni painted many such portraits of young Englishmen on the Grand Tour in Rome: J. Steegman listed ninety of them ('Some English portraits of Pompeo Batoni' in <i>Burl. Mag.</i>, 88, 1946, p. 55 ff.). He has been credited with the invention of this type of portrait in which the sitter is shown against a background of the Roman Campagna (F. Haskell, 'Pompeo Batoni e gli Inglesi' in <i>Mostra di Pompeo Batoni, catalogo</i>, Lucca, 1967, esp. p. 84 f.). The Temple of Vesta, which appears on the right, was one of his favourite topographical motifs, second only to the Colosseum (see Steegman, p. 56; Haskell, pl. p. 83).\n \n<i>Prov.</i> Family descent: the sitter's sister Anna was the wife of Robert, Lord Petre.

For nearly half a century he recorded the visits to Rome of international travellers on the Grand Tour in portraits that remain among the most memorable artistic accomplishments of the period. He was equally gifted as a history painter, and his religious and mythological paintings were sought after by the greatest princes of Europe.\nEdward Howard (1744-1767) was the son of the Lord Philip Howard, who was the brother of edward Howard, 9th Duke of Norfolk. He is described by David Garrick in a letter of 1764 as 'a very worthy good natured Young Man.' Behind Edward there is a carefully observed representation of  the circular temple of Vesta, known in the 18th century as the Temple of the Sibyl, set within the Roman countryside. The ruined temple appears to have been one of Batoni's favourite motifs as it reappears in several of his portraits. The dionysiac scene represented on the vase appears in various versions and may be a pastiche.",

The \u2018Grand Tour\u2019 was a journey, usually through France and Italy, made by classically educated male members of the northern European ruling class to complete their education, to acquire manners and languages and to attain an understanding of the politics of other countries, their economies, geography and history. Especially from the 17th century onwards, it was undertaken to admire (or pretend to admire) the remains of the Classical past and to collect art and antiquities. \n\nThe conventions of the Grand Tour portrait were brilliantly perfected by Pompeo Batoni who showed the wealthy and aristocratic youth of England and Scotland elegantly posed before the most celebrated statues and monuments of ancient Rome. If Batoni were too expensive or unavailable, other popular portraitists were George Willison (1741\u201397), and Nathaniel Dance-Holland.",
