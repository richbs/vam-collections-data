The server is a woodland scene: the brushy green enabled handle carries twigs and three leaves, and is replete with a coiled green tree snake, hidden in the leaves, and with stouter branches-a split stem-that grasp and embrace the blade. The blade itself is an etch imprinted in bold block letters with words-partake, consume, ingest, digest, binge etc.-that propose a serious alimentary exercise. The cloisonn\u00e9 enamelled, arched handle changes cross-section from circular to oval cross-section. It is held by a short round socket and a knurled butt plate from which the stem protrudes. The handle has a silver strap on each side and terminates inside a cap that decreases through three thin flat knurled ovals to a final silver button.",
