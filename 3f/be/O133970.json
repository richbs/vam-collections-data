It was originally acquired as an example of students' work and classified as such (no.17054). In 1959 it was taken into the permanent collection and re-numbered.\n\nFrom January 1968 the painting was lent to the Malvern College of Art for two years.\n\nHistorical significance: Richard Jack (1866-1952) was born in Sunderland, County Durham. He first studied at York School of Art, where in 1886 he won a National Scholarship to attend the central government-run art school at South Kensington (based at the South Kensington Museum, later re-named the V&A). Jack studied at South Kensington until 1888 when a Travelling Scholarship took him to Paris, where he studied at the Atelier Julian and the Atelier Colarossi. Jack remained in Paris for some three years. \n\nOn his return to London Jack found work as an illustrator for magazines, including the <u>Idler</u>. In 1926 he painted a portrait of George V, followed by Queen Mary in 1927 (both Royal Collection). In this year he also painted a detailed interior view of the Blue Drawing Room at Buckingham Palace, presumably commissioned by Queen Mary.  Jack exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1893, and was elected RA in 1920. In 1900 he was awarded a silver medal at the Paris International Exhibition. From around 1930 onwards Jack lived and worked in Canada. \n\nJack made this impressive nude study during his time as a student in Paris. Study of the human figure was tangential to the curriculum followed at the South Kensington art school. By contrast, French art school training focused strongly on the nude model. The painting was acquired by South Kensington after Jack's return to London as an example of student work.",
