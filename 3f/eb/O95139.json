He trained first at the Birmingham School of Silversmithing and Jewellery (now part of the University of Central England). He then went to the Royal College of Art in London, where he was taught by Robert Goodden and Gerald Benney.\n\nLloyd works mainly to commission. His work reflects his love of nature and appreciation of creativity. Major works include a bowl for Lord Porter, an offertory salver for Lichfield Cathedral and a range of chapel furnishings for St Oswald's Hospice, Newcastle upon Tyne.\n\nHis work is found in many private collections, including The Silver Trust, 10 Downing Street, as well as in museums across the United Kingdom. These include Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, the Royal Scottish Museum in Edinburgh and the V&A.",
