            "public_access_description": "This tile was one of hundreds of  products produced in the early 1960s illustrated with images of  the Liverpool group The Beatles. Its lead guitarist George Harrison (1943-2001) was instrumental in creating what is known as The Beatles' sound.  His discovery of the Indian instrument the sitar led to an expansion in The Beatles' musical repertoire, and he encouraged the others to explore their spirituality and transcendental meditation with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, later immortalised in John Lennon's song 'Sexy Sadie'.  After the The Beatles split up in 1970, George was the first to enjoy commercial and critical acclaim as a solo artist with his album All Things Must Pass.  He tragically died of cancer at the age of fifty-eight and his life was celebrated in a Royal Albert Hall concert in 2002, put together by his long-time friend and fellow guitarist Eric Clapton.\n\nThe earliest examples of Beatles' merchandising were produced in the United States, after the Beatles' manager Brian Epstein sold licensing rights to Seltaeb, the American company whose name spelt Beatles backwards. After a flood of successful Beatles items from stockings to talcum powder, Epstein realised the lucrative potential of the market and kept firm control of all future licensing. This tile is one of a set of five produced in England, one representing each individual band member and one showing the group.",
