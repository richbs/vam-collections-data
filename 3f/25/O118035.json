Although the design is old, it is more likely to have been made in the eighteenth or early nineteenth century, probably in Scandinavia.  Rings of this type, made from thin stamped silver, often gilded, widening at the front, were worn with traditional costume throughout Norway and Sweden, where they were often used as betrothal rings.  Later in the nineteenth century many were decorated with little pendent rings, of the kind which are now considered typical of Scandinavian traditional finger rings.",
