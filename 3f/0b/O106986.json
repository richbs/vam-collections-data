He played as seminal role in the development of modern sculpture in Britain in the interwar years. After Chichester Technical Art School he moved to London in 1899, where he served as an apprentice draughtsman to the architect William D. Caroe (1857-1938), whilst also attending evening classes in lettering in Central School of Arts  &amp; Crafts and classes in masonry and letter-cutting at the Westminster Technical Institute. He left London in 1903 and settled in Ditchling, Sussex, where he opened a workshop and started to sculpt, as well as writing on social, political and religious subjects. His strong religious faith coupled with his fear of the industrial commercialisation if the modern world, made him to convert to Roman Catholicism, and subsequently he set up the crafts Guild of St Joseph and St Dominic.",
