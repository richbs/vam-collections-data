They probably date between the sixteenth and seventeenth century, as the inlay is reminiscent of late Mamluk/ early Ottoman wood inlay. Late Mamluk/ early (Egyptian Ottoman) inlay dates between 1480 A.D. and 1550 A.D. The chief characteristic of this inlay is that it is mainly composed from un-carved pieces of bone and wood, and sometimes even painted bone. This type of inlay creates a checkerboard motif. This inlay was also technically different from other Egyptian techniques: each slice of bone would probably have been glued onto the surface of the wood. This differed from earlier Mamluk inlay techniques where individual panels would have been placed within a complex wooden frame (without the use of adhesives). The nine panels were probably part of a minbar (Islamic pulpit) and formed part of the surface decoration of this object. \n\nThis set of panels was originally collected by the South Kensington Museum (later the Victoria and Albert Museum) in 1869. The Museum bought a selection of objects from a Turkish bureaucrat known as \u2018Dr Meymar\u2019, who lived in Cairo during the mid nineteenth century. Dr Meymar\u2019s collection formed the basis of the collection of Mamluk objects held at the Victoria and Albert Museum.",
