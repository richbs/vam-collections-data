                        "label_text": "British Galleries period room book:\nA room from a house at Bromley-by-Bow, near London\n1606\n \nThe house, later known as 'The Old Palace'\nThe house from which this room came was marked with a stone dated 1606 and was probably built in that year. By the time the house was demolished in 1894, it was called 'The Old Palace' and there was a local tradition that it had been used as a hunting-lodge by James I.  This tradition may have come about in part because the royal arms are carved on this overmantel, but there is no solid evidence for the story.  [79]\n\nIt is more likely that the house was built as a second home by a London merchant or courtier. Bromley-by-Bow was then a pleasant country area, but easily accessible from London. The house was a substantial, four-storey building in red brick, with two projecting towers at the front and about 24 rooms.  It was similar in design to other houses recorded in drawings by the surveyor John Thorpe, which date from about 1590 to 1625, but we cannot be sure who designed this house. Although it was not a large house by courtly standards, it was certainly built by someone of means and pretension. Surviving houses of this kind in London are Sutton House, Hackney and Eastbury House, Barking, both open to the public.[133]\n\nThe house was refurbished in 1660-1670 and, more substantially about 1750, when it was divided into two dwellings. It was demolished in 1894 to make way for a school, at which time this, the best surviving room of the house, was purchased by the Museum, following a public campaign to save it.  [46]\n[Map showing location of Bromley-by-Bow]\n\nThe room\nThis room was the grandest room on the ground floor. It overlooked the garden and was probably a parlour, used for dining or receiving visitors and as a room for the owner to relax in comfort and privacy. It was not the grandest room in the house. That was on the first floor, where the most important guests would have been entertained.  [60]\n\nThis room was, even so, richly decorated. The panelling, overmantel and ceiling are rare survivals today, but similar ones would have been found in numerous houses in and around London in about 1600. The carving reflects the latest Renaissance style in details such as the pilasters that divide the panelling. These are carved at the top with plain, classical capitals and with bands of strapwork down their length. On the overmantel are figures of Peace to the left, with frond or branch and Plenty to the right, with a cornucopia. [80]\n\nThe plaster ceiling is original and represents the best Jacobean plasterwork. Ceilings of this type were always whitewashed, rather than coloured, but were decorated with elaborate relief ornament that was cast from wooden moulds.  \n\nSix plaster medallions on the ceiling represent Joshua, Hector and Alexander.  These are three of a traditional group of 'Nine Worthies', that included 3 classical heroes, 3 Jewish and 3 Christian. The fact that the royal arms of James I appear on the overmantel and ceiling does not mean that the house was a royal property. They may have been used to express the loyalty of the owner or, indeed, to hide the fact that he did not possess his own coat of arms. [122]  \n[Plan of ground-floor of house showing location of room]\n\n[Photo of the room in situ at Bromley-by-Bow]\n\nThe room in 1894, just before the house was finally demolished\n \nThe Room Today\n\nWhen the house faced demolition in 1893, the architect and designer C.R. Ashbee (1863-1942) led a protest against its demolition. This was one of the first public campaigns to prevent the destruction of a historic building and led directly to the Museum buying the panelling and plasterwork of the best-surviving room. [56]\n\nOriginally the room had two windows, in the long wall that is now missing, and a door opposite the chimney-piece, which led to a passage.  In the 18th century the original casement windows were replaced with sash windows and a door was cut through the panelling on each side of the chimney-piece. When the room was dismantled these later additions were not saved.  [62]\n\nNo written descriptions exist of the original window wall and there are no surviving drawings to record what it looked like.  Because of this, no attempt has been made to recreate it.  The original floor did not survive but this one has been made up of old oak planks of different widths, as the original floor would have been. The hearth space, which had not survived, has been reconstructed using salvaged Tudor bricks.  [72]\n\n[Ashbee drawing]\nC.R. Ashbee's drawing of the room in 1893"

At the ceiling level is a richly ornamented oak freize with strapwork panels of similar relief but of different design, separated by brackets, with a dentil moulding above, the whole being surmounted by an ogee cornice. The brackets dividing the panels and supporting the cornice are formed each of a combination of triglyph and console. They occur over every stile of the paneling and are repeated twice over the pilasters.\n\nThe oak overmantel has in the centre the royal arms of James I carved in very high relief. The shield is: Quaterly, 1st and 4th the arms of England and France quartered, 2nd Scotland, 3rd Ireland, encircled by the garter with the motto HONI SOIT QUI MAL Y PENSE, and supported by the lion and unicorn with elaborate mantling. Below is a shaped label with the motto DIEU ET MON DROIT, and above the shield, a crowned helmet surmounted by a lion passant gardant. The arms rest on a ledge, supported by modillions, and having in the centre a breacket in the form of a grotesque mask with an oblong pane, of scrollwork on either side. On each side of the arms is a niche carved and grooved inside and surrounded with nail-head ornament, containing figures of Peace and Plenty respectively, carved in elm and formerly gilded. Each is set in an architectural frame with base and entablature supported by carved and fluted columns. These are surmounted on the inner ends by tapering obelisks, resting on four balls, upon bases pierced with four round-headed arches.  (cf Croscombe Church, Somerset; St Johns church, Leeds). On each of the inner ends of the entablature is a pair of terminal figures of grotesque female form supporting a cornice carved with three consoles and forming a framework to the coat of arms. Rising above this is a curved pediment of open strapwork and below, in he angles at either end and resting on the entablature, is a similar ornament of bracket shape. The whole ovemantel rests on a long shelf, of which the front, of quarter-round section, is carved with strapwork ornament and grotesques, and with four bosses in the form of terminal figures, male and female one below the base of each of the columns. This is supported by oak pilasters or caryatides, one of which flanks the opening of the fireplace on either end. These, in conjunction with the mantel-shelf, form a framework to the stone lining; that on the left being surmounted by a small finely-carved male bust, and that on the right by a female; while the terminal-shaped shaft of each, carved with a festoon of drapery and split baluster ornament, rests on a pedestal in the form of masonry with a moulded base. On arrival at the Museum, the fireplace was thickly covered with successive coats of paint, the removal of which revealed the richness and quality of the carving.\n\nThe plaster ceiling (museum no. 51-1894), original to the room, is planned on a pattern of intersecting squares, quatrefoils, and shaped panels, with eight enriched pendants hanging from the point of intersection of the strapwork ribs; the ribs being moulded with a trailing pattern of fruit and flowers. The centres of sixe of the quatrefoils are occupied by circular medallions surmounted by wreaths and winged cherub heads, and containing full-faced bearded busts representing three of the Nine Worthies, inscribed 'IOSUE.DUX', 'HECTOR.TRO', ALEXANDER', each head being repeated twice. The remaining quatrefoil in the centre of the ceiling contains the shield of James I bearing the royal arms, as on the overmantel, but without the supporters, and surmounted with a crown on the side of which are the letters I.R. each of the shaped panels contains a conventional floral pattern of sprigs, sprays and fruit.\n\nThe oak floor boards displayed with the panelling since 2001 are not original to it; they are salvaged floorboards acquired c.2000 as 'dressing' for the room.",

Originally the room had two windows overlooking a garden, to the right of the chimney-piece,  and a doorway opposite the chimney-piece, which led into a passage.\n\nDesign\nThe panelling is divided by six Doric  pilasters, or rectangular columns.  These and the frieze that encircles the room at  ceiling height are decorated with strapwork ornament. The elaborate overmantel contains a variety of carved decoration.  The four caryatids (pillars in the form of women) derive from a series of engravings entitled Caryatidae by the Netherlandish designer  Hans Vredeman de Vries (1527-?1606).  Below them, two figures in niches represent Peace and Plenty.  At the base, a panel of strapwork ornament surmounts two pilasters.\n\nThe stone chimney-piece features a frieze of carved birds and monsters, which were probably originally picked out in gold and colours.\n\nHistorical Associations\nBy 1750 the house was no longer a private dwelling but the 'Old Palace School'.  In  1894 it was demolished.  This destruction caused an outcry, led by the artist and designer C.R.  Ashbee, which inaugurated the organised preservation of London's architectural history.",

Papineau, who lived in the Palace until 1869.\n\nFrom London 1914 (Clifford Smith)\nFor about a century after being divided in about 1750, the house was occupied as a boarding school, and was known as Palace House School. From 1874 until its destruction, part of the building was used as a club and part finally as a lodging house , the remainder being occupied by a firm of colour-workers, who used the 'State Room' as a store. In 1893 the School Board for London acquired the property for the purpose of erecting a school. They repurchased the mantelpiece of the 'State Room' which had been sold with the rest of the house to a firm of house-breakers, and afterwards transferred their purchase to the Museum, for which the paneling and ceiling, a stone chimney-piece from an adjoining room and an archway from the hall had already been acquired. A few plaster details from ceilings and freizes in other rooms (not specified), parts of the original oak mullioned windows, some leaded glass and some painted panels (nos. 1282-1282x-1900), were afterwards presented in 1900 by the Committee for the Survey of the Memorials of Greater London, who were influential in securing the paneled room for the Museum.\n\nAt the time of demolition, the room, which was situated on the ground loor at the back of the house, was fitted with a partition, two pinewood doorways, one on either side of the fireplace, three sash-windows, and an inner marble mantel-piece (added in the 18th century). As first set up in the Museum the paneling was slightly rearranged and parts renewed. Paneling from the fourth wall between the sash windows was used to fill the space occupied by the pinewood doorways.",
