He was the son of Jupiter and Alcmena, a Theban princess. He is regarded as the embodiment of physical strength and courage.\nHis two main attributes are the club and the lion's skin, which he won at his first labour. He had to undertake 12 labours as a penance for slaying his own children in an act of madness.\n\nNessus was a centaur. On a journey Hercules and Deianiera came to a river, where Nessus wad the ferryman and tried to delight her. When Hercules realised he sent his bow and slew Nessus. When dying he told Deianiera to collect his blood as it would one day help her as a love elixir. Anyone who would wear a garment rubbed with the blood would love her forever.\n\nGiambologna (ca. 1524-1608) (Giovanni Bologna) was born in Flanders. Giambologna went to Rome to study antique sculpture from about 1550 to 1553. He then travelled through Florence where he was persuaded to stay. He became sculptor to the Medici family and thus became one of the most influential sculptors of the late 16th and early 17th centuries. He drew attention to many artists  from Northern Europe and disseminated his style mainly through small bronzes. He established an efficient and large workshop.",
