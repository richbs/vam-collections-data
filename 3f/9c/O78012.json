The demand for 'antique' vases was so great that, in addition to copying surviving Classical antiquities, manufacturers copied designs from prints of the 17th and 18th centuries. Some of these prints were highly fanciful inventions, which were not seriously intended for production. Wedgwood (1730-1795) adapted the design here from a vase print by Friedrich Kirschner (1748-1789), a German painter of miniatures.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe decoration imitates the veining of agate and other hardstones. This effect was achieved by 'wedging' (blending) coloured clays together. Pottery made in this way is described as 'solid agate ware.' There are no mould seam lines, and the spiralling of the clays inside the vase suggest that it was thrown on a wheel. It was then turned on a lathe and fired and glazed. The marble foot is a replacement.\n\nPeople\nThe vase was formerly in the collection of the Victorian statesman W. E. Gladstone.",
