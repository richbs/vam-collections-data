Living in the artistic community of Ditchling, East Sussex, in the 1930s he was much influenced by Eric Gill and the Guild of St Joseph and Sr Dominic, under whose auspices (with Philip Hagreen) he published <i>Silversmithing: Its Principles and Practice in Small Workshops</i>. \n\nTwo years after coming to Ditchling in 1932, Pruden joined the Guild, founded by Eric Gill with Hilary Pepler and Desmond Chute, and formally constituted in 1921. It was a Catholic community of work, faith and domestic life which attracted craftsmen until it was disbanded in 1989.\n\nFor a number of years, commencing in 1934, Pruden was in charge of Silversmithing at Brighton School of Art. His best-known pupils include Gerald Benney, Michael Murray, and Anthony Elson. His silversmithing heritage continues in Ditchling through his grandson, Anton. His book <i>Silversmithing</i> was printed by St Dominic's Press and became the foundation for his teaching career at Brighton. He fulfilled hundreds of commissions for ecclesiastical metalwork, and in addition to working in silver he occasionally carved in ivory.\n\nThe following passage is written by Dunstan's widow, Winifrede, and taken directly from an epilogue to Pruden\u2019s unpublished autobiography, <i>So Doth the Smith</i>, extracts from which are reproduced in <u>Art and Design at Brighton 1859-2009: from Arts and Manufactures to the Creative and Cultural Industries</u>.\n<i>'[Dunstan] scorned any high fallutin\u2019 ideas about inspiration, and sneered horribly about \u201cartistic temperament\u201d or \u201cbeing in the mood\u201d.  He was a complete professional.  He was so disciplined that he could put down anything he was doing without hesitation, or stop reading a book in mid-sentence.  He admired the attitude of Doctor Johnson who wrote Rasselas in less than a month to pay for his mother\u2019s funeral.  Only amateurs, Dunstan maintained, could afford to keep a muse.'</i>",
