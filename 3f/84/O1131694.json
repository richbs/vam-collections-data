You labelled it as \"Queen Anne\" [this was a term at that time applied erroneously to early wooden dolls of almost any date], and [I] believe it is still so described.  I therefore thought the following notes might interest you, culled from old family notes and papers.  Those re the doll were testified to by a Miss Margaret Bray, daughter of one Admiral E. Bray (my great-great-Aunt) - I am 78.  About 1800 her great friend was a Miss Elizabeth Cunningham, daughter of Captain James Cunningham, R.N.  Her mother's family were close adherents of the [Young] Pretender, Charles Stuart, and had accompanied them to St Germains (one being a lady-in-waiting).  Thus Miss Cunningham had been given many gifts of great interest, among them being \"A large old Doll, which had been in use at Holyrood, and a chair for the said old Doll, an exact pattern of those in use in the Palace.\"  Miss Cunningham left all to Miss Bray when she died...\"",
