Laposky used an oscilloscope to manipulate electronic waves that were then displayed on a fluorescent screen.  The waves would have been constantly moving and undulating on the screen, but there was no way of recording these movements on paper at this time.  By photographing them, the artist was able to capture these images and record them for history.\n\nLaposky photographed different combinations of these waves and called his images 'Oscillons'.  The earliest photographs, such as this one, were black and white, but in later years the artist used a filter in order to produce striking colour images.\n\nOscilloscopes are used in many different disciplines, including medicine, engineering and telecommunications.  Laposky used an analogue oscilloscope, in which the electrical signal is recorded as a wave.",
