The garment is \nheat-printed with a plasticised design showing the character Bart \nSimpson, from the cartoon series \"The Simpsons\".  Bart is shown in \nblue T-shirt, shorts and shoes, leaning on his upended skateboard with  \na speech bubble coming from his mouth containing one of his \ncatch-phrases \"I'M BART SIMPSON.  WHO THE HECK ARE YOU ?\" and \nhis name above in red. The Simpsons\", a cartoon series shown on \ncable television, is the creation of Matt Groening, and is marketed on a \nwide variety of goods for children.  Like the Turtles, their appeal to \nchildren is supposed to lie in adult disapproval of them, and in the \neccentric use of various words and phrases supposedly unintelligible to \nadults.",
