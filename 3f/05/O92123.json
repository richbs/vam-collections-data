As Monghyr was on the route between Calcutta and Delhi, local craftsmen found a ready market in the Europeans who stopped at the town for rest and refreshment. Some of them left detailed accounts of their purchases. The profuse ornamentation of the surface of this piece suggests that it was made in the mid 19th century, probably as a collector\u2019s item.",
