Two other women, Religion and Piety, await them half-way up the mountain. The set of tapestries linked the Ages of Man with the Pilgrimage of Life.

The initial designs were drawn by Giorgio Vasari in 1559, the working cartoons were painted by Giovanni Stradanus and the tapestries were woven by the Florentine workshop of Benedetto Squilli from 1562 onwards - completed in 1565 (Campbell, p.503). Of fourteen tapestries, only four surviving tapestries can be identified: one in the V&A Museum; one in the Deposito del Museo Nazionale di San Matteo, Pisa; one in the Mobilier National, Paris and the fourth in Mus\u00e9e National de la Reniassance, Ecouen.\n\nHistorical significance: Tapestry production in Italy during 1520 to1560 saw the establishment of new workshops in the hope that Italian products might be cheaper than Netherlandish import; there was a vision of a native industry that might eventually compete with the workshops of Brussels. However, most Italian ateliers were short-lived and their distance from the main Netherlandish centres and their use of designs made by artists who worked in the mainstream of Italian style, rather than in the Netherlandish tradition, guaranteed that their products were among the most innovative of the periods. Due to the extensive use of metallic oxides in their dyes, which is especially destructive to wools and silks, the tapestries were more prone to deterioration than their Netherlandish counterparts.\nThis tapestry is a fine example of the Mannerist style of palace decoration.",

            "historical_context_note": "The figures appear also in a series of six prints of the <i>Life of Man</i> after Stradanus engraved by Furnius in 1570. The engravings link the Ages of Man with the Pilgrimage of Life, Youth is given the choice between the World, the Flesh and the Devil and the Path of Virtue. Manhood is assisted by the four Cardinal Virtues. These most likely reflect the design of the eight lost tapestries linked to humanistic themes given a specifically Christian context.",
