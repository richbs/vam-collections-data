The faithful believed that by touching a reliquary, they would receive protection against sickness and ill fortune.\nReliquaries were often made of precious materials - gold or silver, with enamel or gems - and they took many forms.

            "public_access_description": "A reliquary is a container for displaying precious relics, consisting of the bones and possessions associated with Christ and the saints. In the Middle Ages these relics were thought to have miraculous powers and were greatly venerated. The faithful believed that by  praying, and by touching a reliquary, they would receive protection against sickness and ill fortune.\nReliquaries were generally made of precious materials \u2013 gold or silver, with enamel or gems \u2013 and they took many forms. Some were shaped to represent the saint, or a body part such as an arm, leg, head, foot or finger. Others were designed as a monstrance, with the relic on view inside a glass compartment (Latin 'monstrare' means \u2018to show\u2019). Another style of reliquary, the  tempietto (meaning \u2018little temple\u2019), reflected architectural forms of the period.\nIn this case the hand probably originally formed part of an arm reliquary. The relics (now lost) would have been visible through the windows in the fingers. The ring is worn almost at the fingertip, a common practice throughout the Middle ages and well into the 16th century.",

The faithful believed that by touching a reliquary, they would receive some of this holy quality.\n\nReliquaries were central features of the Medieval Church Treasury. They symbolised the status and authority of the Church. Relics attracted pilgrims who made gifts and monetary donations to the Church in which they were held. Local people also gave in honour of their saint and to gain protection for themselves and their town. Thus relics could often give a sense of identity within the church community. Some reliquaries were used in religious precessions or festivals, which both involved the community and also reinforced the status of the Church.\n\nReliquaries were often shaped to represent the part of the body preserved. In this case the hand may have originally formed part of an arm. It was also common for reliquaries to be constructed from gold or silver and enameled or set with gems. The relics (now lost) would have been visible through the windows in the fingers. The style of the ring, worn almost at the fingertip, suggests a date of between 1400 and 1500.",
