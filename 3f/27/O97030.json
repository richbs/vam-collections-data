Waxes were used in a similar way to prints and medals, in order to disseminate the image of the sitter, or, like miniature paintings or silhouettes as portable mementoes. Wax was well suited to being cast and reproduced many times over from the same mould in order to propagate an image.\n\nThe popularity of wax portraits was in part driven by their links with other types of portrait manufacture such as ceramic medallions. \n\nThe process of making a portrait in wax would begin with a model in plasticine or soft wax which would be worked using ivory or wooden tools in much the same way as a model in clay. A plaster mould would then be made and molten wax poured into it. The relief would be hand-finished by the artist.\n\nCatherine Andras was appointed Modeller in Wax to Queen Charlotte in 1802.",
