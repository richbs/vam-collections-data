The fashionable coats and waistcoats of the 1840s were usually fitted with small waists. The shape of the shirt altered to accommodate this and decrease any bulk around the waist. As the waistcoat was cut lower in front, the shirt-front was decorated with fine vertical pin tucks on either side of the button opening. Shirts were often sent out for laundering, so most are marked with the owner\u2019s name or initials and a number or the date they were purchased. This example is marked \u2018J. Smith 1844\u2019.",
