Brewster-type lenticular stereoscope on side-table. Inscription (verso): Isabella Grace Maude 77 x 125 mm (stereoscopic) PH 457-1968:252 Literature: Microfilm: 3.19.285 Lady Hawarden may have chosen a stereoscopic camera as her first camera because of its flexibility. Stereoscopic cameras were adaptable to several different applications, for instance, 'Instantaneous Views, Stereoscopic Portraits, Interiors, &c.' [J.H. Oallmeyer, advertisement, The Photographic News Almanac [...] 1862, London 1861.] An added advantage was the speed of exposure, facilitated by the short focal length of the lenses. Stereoscopic cameras were small, compact and readily portable. Additionally, stereoscopic photography had a novelty value from the time of its introduction to the public at the 1851 Great Exhibition. The illusion of three-dimensional space produced when stereoscopic photographs are seen through a stereoscopic viewer brought a popularity which endured until the end of the century. Finally, it was possible to adapt a stereoscopic camera for use as a carte-de-visite camera. For examples of photographs which may have been intended to be trimmed to carte-de-visite format, see D.238 to D.247. A Brewster-type stereoscope--so-called because the design is based on that given in Sir Oavid Brewster's The Stereoscope (1856) [see Beaumont Newhall, The History of-pfiotography, New York 1982, 114] may be seen on the table beside the girl in this photograph.
