It is one of a set of five figures issued by Briglin Pottery, makers of decorative domestic earthenware, in 1959, a year after they decided to revive the Staffordshire tradition of pottery figures of performers. The actor Herbert Lom, the partner of  Briglin's Brigitte Goldmith contacted Sir Laurence Olivier, Vivien Leigh, Sir John Gielgud, Dame Margot Fonteyn, Paul Robeson, Maria Callas and Alec Guinness, who all agreed to feature. Lom wrote a leaflet advertising the proposed edition of 100 figures of seven personalities, with their quotes expressing delight in their inclusion.\n\nSince Briglin's earthenware proved unsuitable, Lom commissioned Richard Parkinson to design and make them at his pottery from continental-type porcelain, fired at high temperatures and decorated in green and black. The slip-cast figures proved tricky; the moulds had to be made in several pieces and most of them, except Paul Robeson and Vivien Leigh, had to be tall and thin, unlike the rest of Parkinson's pottery. After Robeson, the fifth model, the Parkinsons realised their charge of \u00a32 a figure was unrealistic.  Since Lom refused to raise the price, the project was terminated and only about 6 figures of Robeson were made.  In 1959 however the set featured in London's Design Centre where Briglin sold them for 10 guineas each, and 40 guineas a set. The Duke of Edinburgh and Charlton Heston each bought a set.",

One of the founders of Briglin was Brigitte Goldmith whose partner was the actor Herbert Lom; he made contact with the personalities they wanted to feature.  These were Sir Laurence Olivier as Henry V, Vivien Leigh as Cleopatra, Sir John Gielgud as Hamlet, Dame Margot Fonteyn as Ondine, Paul Robeson as Othello, Maria Callas as Violetta and Alec Guinness as himself.  Briglin planned a limited edition of one hundred figures of seven personalities.  Lom wrote a publicity brochure, with quotes from the actors saying they were delighted to be included, and that the tradition was to be revived.\n\nSince Briglin couldn't provide the bodies themselves, because they used an earthenware body that was unsuitable for such detailed work, Lom who lived near the Parkinsons in Kent, commissioned the Parkinsons to do the figures for \u00a32 each. The figures were devised by Richard Parkinson, slip-cast from continental-type porcelain, fired at very high temperatures and decorated in green and black by Susan Parkinson.  The figures were tricky to produce; the moulds had to be made in several pieces because the figures were very detailed and because most of them, apart from Paul Robeson and Vivien Leigh, had to be relatively tall and thin, quite unlike the rest of the Parkinson's pottery. \n\nAfter having made the fifth model the Parkinsons realised that they could not continue to make them for the agreed price.  Since Lom was adamant about a price increase, only the first five were made, and only about six of Robeson.  Despite the termination of the project the figures were displayed in the Design Centre in 1959 where Briglin sold them for 10 guineas each, or 40 guineas for the set.  The Duke of Edinburgh and Charlton Heston bought a set, and Brigitte Goldsmith presented the figurines of  Vivien Leigh and Laurence Olivier to her personally. Although not wanting the Parkinson Pottery's name to be associated with the figurines, they were allowed to mark them inside the base which was brushed with a band of colour on the white clay and scratched through: 'Made for Briglin Pottery by Susan Parkinson.'",
