As well as the Holy Spirit, it also suggests the dove which brought an olive leaf to Noah, signifying man's reconciliation with God after the Flood.  \n\nThe use of a Saint-Esprit in French jewellery probably comes from the pendant of the chivalric Ordre du Saint-Esprit.  It was used in traditional costume in other parts of France as well, particularly in the Auvergne, but the Normandy dove is the only one which carries a branch in its beak.  Like many of the Normandy crosses, the Saint-Esprit was usually set with transparent stones, but the branch was often decorated with coloured stones, as here.  It was worn on a black velvet ribbon, fastened tightly round the neck like a choker, with a slide at the front (now missing).  The ribbon passes through the bale of the pendant, and is then threaded through a hole or loop at the base of the slide, and out at either side.  The ribbon is tied in a bow at the back of the neck.",
