These special items were produced by manufacturers or commissioned by retailers for  international exhibitions in the 19th century  to generate publicity and consumer interest through the display of design flair and working skills. The flagon was shown as a companion to a more elaborately chased example which had gained a prize medal for the retailers Lambert and Rawlings. It was purchased for the V&A Museum for \u0153 128 8s. A report of 1852 commented that the flagon was  ' remarkable for the elegance and simplicity of the general form, and the delicacy and subordination of the ornamental portions'.\n\nRetailer & Manufacturer\nThe London firm of Lambert and Rawlings, who commissioned this flagon, were one of the most important retailers to specialise in selling reproduction silver in historic styles as well as genuine antiques. The Fox family of silversmiths enjoyed a long working relationship with Lambert and Rawlings and generally supplied silver in period styles  such as this Gothic revival flagon. The large size of the piece ensured that it would be expensive to make in terms of time and material. Reportedly it took one man 12 weeks to make this flagon.",
