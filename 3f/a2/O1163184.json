The coverlet also testifies to the maker's ingenuity in terms of both materials and design.  The black fabric is recycled from her blackout curtain, while some of the cottons are from swatches sent to a family friend at House & Garden magazine. The main bulk of the hexagons were cut from old dresses and shirts. The reverse is believed to be cotton used for Red Cross famine-relief parcels which she acquired from an army-surplus store. The quilt took between two and three years to complete, and was worked on mainly in the evenings.  This was the only patchwork coverlet she ever made.",
