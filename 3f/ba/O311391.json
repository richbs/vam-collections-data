In the second half of the 16th century he became one of the most important sculptors active in Venice. On his arrival in Venice in 1543 he worked for Jacopo Sansovino (1486-1570). He left Venice for Vicenza for a period of around 6 years. Apart from that and another short stay in 1576-77 when he worked in Brescia and Vicenca again to avoid the plaque, he remained in Venice until his death. He is buried in the church of S. Zaccaria, where there is also a marble self-portrait bust as part of the monument. Portrait busts form a large part of his oevre.",
