They offered a precious image of the King that was small enough to be awarded personally by him in a public ceremony, They could be worn to mark the King's favour and the courtier's loyalty.\n\nPeople\nWhen James VI of Scotland (ruled 1567-1625) became James I of England in 1603, he offered the nation the security of unquestioned dynastic roots. His mother, Mary, Queen of Scots (1542-1587), was a great granddaughter of Henry VII of England (ruled 1485-1509). He offered a hopeful dynastic future in the form of his young heir, Prince Henry (1594-1612); he also had a marriageable daughter, Princess Elizabeth (1596-1662).  James embraced the miniature portrait as a way of promoting the new Stuart dynasty.\n\nNicholas Hilliard (possibly born in 1547, died 1619) had painted many miniatures of Elizabeth I, but did not seem to enjoy producing miniatures of the new King. James I was less physically attractive than his predecessor. He also disliked sitting for his portrait.  Hilliard probably had only a few sittings with the King between his accession in 1603 and his own death in 1619.  From these original miniatures Hilliard was expected to produce endless repetitions for the King to give away as gifts. Many of these are of  poor quality. They are either by a very uninspired Hilliard or, as in this case, probably by an assistant.",
