Purging, in the form of bleeding or induced vomiting, was believed to be useful for expelling them. This cup is made of antimony, a toxic metal that causes vomiting, diarrhoea and breathing difficulties when touched or ingested. Antimony was used in medicine from the 12th century but was so much abused that in 1566 it was banned in France. In the mid-17th century it was brought back into use and regained popularity.\n\nOwnership & Use\n Antimonial remedies usually came in the form of cups, or as pills that could either be swallowed or soaked in wine. Either would have been fairly expensive, but the cups were likely to have cost more than the pills. Cups like this one,  made entirely of antimony, are extremely rare. The decorative case suggests that it was a prized item.\n\nMaterials & Making\nAntimony is a silver-white metal. It combines readily with other metals to form alloys and was added to pewter to harden it from the 17th century. This cup was made in separate pieces, cast in moulds and then joined together.",
