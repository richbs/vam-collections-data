He trained as a sociologist and teacher, then became a 'social photographer' and worked with organisations campaigning for reform. He originally published this photograph in a survey by the magazine Charities and Commons into the living conditions of steelworkers in Pittsburgh. Huge numbers of eastern Europeans came to work in Pittsburgh during this period. They were often labouring to send money back to their families. Here Hine poses a group of steelworkers shoulder to shoulder. We are struck by their shared looks and brotherly solidarity, as well as by their social isolation.",
