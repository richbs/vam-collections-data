George Chaffee in his publication \"The Romantic Ballet in London\", Dance Index, Vol II 9-12, September-December 1943 suggests that the subject is Caroline Brocard and the pendent print 'L'Adonis du Village' Antoine Coulon in a ballet in 1826.  He would prefer the subjects to be Charles Vestris and his wife Caroline Ronzi, but opines that the date is an obstacle and therefore settles on Brocard and Coulon, though the setting and costuming does not suggest any of the subjects of  the ballets produced in 1826.   However, Vestris and Ronzi were appearing at the King's Theatre as late as 1825, and if it were not that English prints were usually topical, one would be tempted to suggest the subject as 'La Noce du Village', first produced in 1823 but revived in 1824 and 1825, and described by John Ebers in Seven Years of the King's Theatre as 'a lively and interesting rural piece' (though whether 'rural' in this context is synonymous with 'rustic' is impossible to say)\nThe print came to the Museum as part of the Cyril Beaumont Bequest.  \nIn the 19th century, the margins of prints were often left to be folded over card or stretcher before framing.  This print was originally folded over card to the plate size and was been restored to its pre-folded state in 2001.\n\nHistorical significance: \"La Fleur du Village\" and the pendant print \"L'Adonis du Village\" are two of the finest prints of  dancers of the pre-Romantic Ballet period.  Prints of the 1820s are usually small scale and uncoloured.",
