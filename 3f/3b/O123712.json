The design is coupled with a type-written description of the dress, detailing the material out of which it is intended to be made, available colours, size suitability, and price (E.483:4-2005). The dress was available in black/sky, navy/sky, or brown/turquoise contrasting moss crepe, which is a fabric woven with a surface that gives a fine moss-like effect. It was also available in black/sky, black/wine red, navy/sky contrasting light wool jersey. The sky-coloured front of the bodice, sleeves and hat, and the black back of the dress, collar, shoes, and the decoration on the hat make a vivid contrast. The design would have been used as a presentation drawing and forms part of an album of 12 designs with accompanying descriptions from which the client could choose what she wanted to have made.",
