The upper garment, called a kataginu, is sleeveless with extended shoulders stiffened with paper. The two vertical panels at the front of the kataginu would have been tucked into the trousers, or hakama, which have narrow ties and a waist board designed to give support to the back. The pleats of the hakama, five in front and two at the back, are believed to symbolise the virtues of a samurai: courage, benevolence, justice, courtesy, sincerity, loyalty and honour. \n\nKamishimo are generally made of hemp rather than silk and are patterned using stencils. The family crest, or mon, of the samurai, resisted with paste and then brushed with pigments, appears on the front and back of the kataginu and the back board of the hakama.",
