Fortuny's production of printed textiles was strongly influenced by his family's collection of Arabic and Oriental decorative arts and textiles. He was also influenced by the city of Venice where he spent his adult life and where he studied Renaissance arts. The motifs used during the Renaissance (such as the grapes or the pomegranate) can be found in his prints.\n\nFortuny liked to experiment with printing techniques. For velvets, he used hand-cut wooden blocks, then he included engraved blocks, metal stencils, hand painting, and finally, a fine cloth stencil. He printed with metallic powders, using bronze or copper powders for a golden effect and aluminium for silver.",
