Arlington was a Royalist in the Civil War, knighted by Charles II during his exile and made principle Secretary of State during the Restoration.  \n\nThis is an eighteenth-century engraving by the Dutch engraver Jacobus Houbraken (1698-1780) after a portrait by the seventeenth-century artist Sir Peter Lely (1618-80).  Houbraken was a Dutch engraver working in Amsterdam and the son of the painter and writer Arnold Houbraken.  Lely, also of Dutch extraction, established a fashionable portrait practice in Covent Garden employing studio assistants to keep up with the growing demand for his services.  In 1680 he was knighted by the King.\n\nArlington is depicted bust length in a Rococo-style frame wearing a fashionable wig and a black patch on his nose which covers a battle scar.  The Rococo style, predominant during the mid-eighteenth century, is known for its asymmetry and patterns taken from nature.  The frame surrounding Arlington is decorated with asymmetric curves and shell shapes.",
