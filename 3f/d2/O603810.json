It was situated on top of a motte on the neck of land separating Castle Loch, to the south of today's Lochmaben, and Kirk Loch, to the west. This castle originally had a wooden keep, which had probably been replaced by stone by the time the castle was captured by Edward I of England in 1298. Edward I set to work to build a second Lochmaben Castle in a much stronger defensive position on a promontory projecting north from the southern shore of Castle Loch, a mile to the south of today's town. The work on the new castle was sufficiently advanced by August 1299 to enable the English to withstand an attack on it by Robert the Bruce. The second Lochmaben Castle was completed some time in the early 1300s, leaving Lochmaben Old Castle abandoned, and probably already stripped of much of its stone to help build its successor. Today only the motte of the old castle remains, as one of the greens of a golf course.",
