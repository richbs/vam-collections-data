It is a riot of asymmetrical scrolling and other rococo elements which include rock and shell work, a cornucopia, fountain, fruit and flowers. The artist\u2019s flight of fancy even extends to a blue dragon emerging from a shell. In the centre, two blond  putti with coloured  wings are engaged in making wine. One squeezes purple grapes into a gilt metal basin while the other drinks wine from an ewer.\n\nIt is not known who made this medallion but the style of painting indicates a German, Swiss or Italian origin. It was made in the middle of the eighteenth century and was almost certainly intended to be mounted in a frame or box lid as the back is covered with very thin and patchy enamel not intended to be viewed.",

            "bibliography": "Sarah Coffin and Bodo Hofstetter, 'The Gilbert Collection: Portrait Miniatures in Enamel', London, 2000\npp.86 & 87. The enamel medallion shown as cat.no.39 is a little bigger than 4890-1901 and is mounted as a pendant but may have originally been intended to be set in a box lid or frame. Though signed by a known enameller, Gaetano Manini (fl. ca.1752-ca.1780/90), it bears some similarity to 4890-1901 in terms of palette, presence of an enigmatic putto, and patchy counter-enamel. This suggests the possibility of 4890-1901 being painted by and Italian hand.\nJonathan W. Snellenburg, '17th and 18th century watches' in 'The Taft Museum [Cincinnati]: Its History and Collections - European Decorative Arts', New York, 1995\npp.444 & 445 show a Swiss mid-18th century watch with movement by Jean-Aim\u00e9 Gaudy of Geneva (Taft inv. no. 1932.86). While the painting of the putti on the watch front is rather different from the delicate rendering of those on 4890-1901, the flowers painted in pink, blue and green inside the watch case are quite similar to the flowers and their colouring on the V&amp;A medallion. This may indicate that our medallion is painted by the hand of a Swiss native or emigr\u00e9.",
