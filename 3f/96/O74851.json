            "public_access_description": "Lady Katherine Grey was one of two sisters of the martyred Lady Jane Grey, whose \u2018Nine Days Reign\u2019 after the death of King Edward VI in 1553 resulted in her imprisonment and execution. As granddaughters of Henry VIII\u2019s sister, Mary, Queen of France, the Grey sisters enjoyed the status of royal princesses. None the less, Katherine fared only slightly better than Jane. In 1560 she secretly married without royal permission, and with the birth of her child imminent, was locked in the Tower of London by Queen Elizabeth I. There is a miniature in a private collection, also by Levina Teerlinc, of Katherine holding her child and wearing a miniature of her husband, with whom she was never reunited. In 1563 she was transferred to the country, where she died in 1568. \n\nOn the basis of costume and the sitter's age, this miniature dates from the reign of Mary I (1553-1558), who Lady Jane Grey had unsuccessfully tried to usurp. Katherine would have been about 15 to 20 years old. Levina Teerlinc\u2019s portrait composition is based on the formula of Hans Eworth, with the sitter painted to the waist with hands clasped together. Levina was the daughter of Simon Benninck, a famous member of the Ghent-Bruges school of illuminators. She was part of the royal household, a gentlewoman to both Mary I and Elizabeth I.",

Together with her elder and younger sisters, Jane and Mary, enjoyed the status of Tudor princesses.  Under Mary she first received the advances of the Duke of Somerset\u2019s son, Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford.  In 1560, without royal permission, she secretly married him, a fact which the imminent birth of a child brought to light.  Sent to the Tower by Elizabeth, she was later, in 1563, transferred to confinement in the country where she died in 1568.\n\nThe miniature is in its original turned ivory box.  The forehead has suffered from abrasion, the background is discoloured and there are paint losses at the edge.  The identification as Lady Catherine Grey is secured by the very early inscription on the back of the miniature.  A second version, very much repainted, of the same miniature but bearing the date 1549 is also in the V&A (P.21-1954).  The date, however, is a later addition and the costume is typical of Mary\u2019s reign which would accord with the age of the sitter, about fifteen to twenty, c. 1555-60.  The formula is derived from portraits by Hans Eworth and this relationship is clearer in the second version which is to the waist and includes hands clasped together.\n\nA third miniature of the same sitter, which may also be by Teerlinc, is at Belvoir Caslte (Duke of Rutland) (Auerbach, <i>Hilliard</i>, pl. 8), depicting the Countess wearing a miniature of her husband and carrying her son in her arms.  The dating can therefore be established as the child was born on September 21st 1561 and must be about a year to eighteenth months in the miniatures, i.e. late 1562 or early 1563.  Large-scale paintings, probably derived from the miniature, exist of this, e.g. Audley End, Petworth, Syon and Trinity College, Oxford.\n\nINSCRIBED: On the reverse in a late sixteenth century hand: <i>the La Kathe\u2019 / Graye. / Wyfe of Therle of hertford.</i>\n\nCOLLECTIONS: Sold anonymously Sotheby\u2019s June 1979 (lot 88).\"<i>\n",
