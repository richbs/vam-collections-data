The 'rings' of the coil are space with mild steel dividers, hinged at both ends to allow the bookcase to move slightly. The dividers are riveted to the coil at one end and bolted at the other, which allows them to be released so the coil can be tightened and reduced in size for transportation or storage. The dividers vary in length which determines the various sizes of the 'shelves'.\n\nThe mild steel used for the bookcase was immersed in oil in production to allow it to cool at a determined rate which ensures its spring. The process also produces the surface finish which can be maintained with a conventional wax-based spray-on furniture polish.",
