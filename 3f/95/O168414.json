            "public_access_description": "The technique of enamel painting on copper was first developed at the imperial workshops in Beijing during the Kangxi reign (1662-1722), possibly due to the influence of the Jesuit missionaries working at court. A layer of enamel was applied on the copper surface and fired; the coloured ground was then painted with polychrome enamels and the object fired for the second time.  \n\nEnamelling on copper began to be produced in Canton at the end of the 17th century, both for the domestic and export markets. This vase, made by special order for European clients, imitates English porcelain models produced at the Chelsea-Derby factory by William Duesbury, active between 1770 and 1784, from designs by Boreman and Asker. Neo-classical shapes were especially popular after 1779; Chinese copies were presumably made in about 1780-1785. The landscape subject on this example was probably inspired by the views of the Derbyshire countryside that were painted on the English porcelain originals; the figures in classical dress were instead a reflection of the new taste for neoclassical designs.",
