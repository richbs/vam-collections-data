Dorothy George, 'Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires in the British Museum', VIII, 1947)\nCovent Garden Theatre was burned down on 20 Sept. 1808. The Duke of Northumberland offered Kemble a loan of \u00a310,000 on his bond, which was returned to be destroyed at the dinner held to celebrate the laying of the foundation stone of the new theatre on 30 Dec. 1808. Boaden relates the generosity, delicacy, and princely charm of the assistance given by the Prince of Wales. Lord Mountjoy was among those calling on the Kembles to condole; he said: 'It will be but 'gratitude' in the people to compensate your loss.' 'Memoirs of J. P. Kemble', 1824, ii. 459-61, 474 f. Presumably the other persons mentioned also subscribed. Its rebuilding led to the O.P. riots, see No. 11414, &c. For an estimate, doubtless exaggerated, of the subscriptions received, see No. 11418.\nGrego, 'Gillray', p. 368. Wright and Evans, No. 567.
