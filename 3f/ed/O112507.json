The distinguishing feature is the white or cream-coloured slip (a thin layer of diluted firing clay), covering the body, on which a variety of decoration is made. Cizhou potters were highly creative. The decorative techniques were employed. Cizhou potters were highly creative, using carving, incising, combing, inlaying, stamping, underglaze painting and overglaze enamelling to decorate their wares. Very often two or more these techniques are combined to decorate single object. Here, the design of camellia flowers on a scrolling leafy branch was incised, but variety was achieved by setting the flowers against a ring-punched background.",

            "public_access_description": "This bottle is an example of Cizhou ware, a type of ceramic made in the northern part of China during the Song dynasty (960-1279). The term Cizhou encapsulates a range of wares made in several regions of northern China, often consisting of a course stoneware body  covered with a white slip (a thin layer of diluted firing clay), and then decorated with a contrasting colour. Vessels of this shape have traditionally been referred to as  meiping, literally 'prunus vases'. However, some of these 'prunus vases' are inscribed with the Chinese words 'fine wine'. \n\nCizhou wares were utilitarian at their time of production and were made in relatively large numbers. This bottle is made in a shape known as meiping (prunus vase), but it was most likely used to store alcohol. Although they were not given high praise at the time of production, the bold designs and simple shapes of Cizhou wares were later treasured by Japanese and Western connoisseurs alike. The studio pottery movement in Britain found affinity with ceramics like this vase, which Bernard Leach praised in his seminal publication, A Potter\u2019s Book, in 1940.",
