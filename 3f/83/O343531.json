Dr. Wentzel also expressed the opinion that he knew nothing like it in German medieval glass. The roundel was acquired by Mr. Dennis King in 1960 from Hill House, Dereham, Norwich (formerly the home of Sir John Fenn of the Paston letters fame) but nothing is known of its earlier provenance, nor are the other five roundels in the series recorded.\n\nBought from Dennis King for 40 pounds (60/3291).",
