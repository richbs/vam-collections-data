The wallpaper is printed with the images of disembodied breast-like shapes sculpted from cigarettes.  This was the backdrop to an eccentric collection of objects  - garden gnomes, chairs, and vacuum cleaners - each of which had some kind of sexual appendage, and was covered with a \u2018skin\u2019 of Marlborough Lights. For Lucas, smoking is part of a laddish life-style in which the relation between the sexes is reduced to crude innuendo, vulgar gestures and sexual slang. Much of her work focuses on this interface between fine art and what we might call \u2018tabloid\u2019 culture.  This wallpaper has since been hung in the foyer of the Visual Arts Department of the British Council at their offices in Portland Place, London.",
