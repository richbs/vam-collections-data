These became dispersed throughout Europe and Charles I inherited a group from his elder brother, Henry, who died in 1612. They doubtless influenced both the King's taste and the imaginative production of Francesco Fanelli.\n\nMaterials & Making\nBronze is an alloy of copper and tin, though its exact content can vary. Fanelli's 'bronzes' actually appear to be brass, which is a copper-zinc alloy, with a dark lacquer applied to the surface.\n\nOwnership & Use\nSimilar bronzes of equestrian subjects were produced by Fanelli for John Holles, the Earl (and later Duke) of Newcastle, governor of the future Charles II.  A version of this bronze and a 'Cupid on Horseback' were listed  in an inventory of the King's collection at Whitehall Palace in 1639.  Both were sold from the royal collection in 1649, after Charles I's execution, but were traced by an agent of Charles II  following the restoration of the monarchy. They are now at Windsor Castle.",
