This shot was the middle one. The first was when the guests arrived in the hallway, this one was when the party was in full swing deep into the night and the third one was at breakfast time when everyone was hung over.\nJim Lee established himself in the 1970s as a leading international photographer based in London, Paris, Milan and New York, shooting for such clients as Valentino, Alexander McQueen, Versace and Yves Saint Laurent. He has recently re-emerged as an active photographer working on numerous magazine editorials with top fashion stylists.",

The idea behind this campaign was to catch a moment in time at a different stage of an all night party. This shot was the middle one. The first was when the guests arrived in the hallway, this one was when the party was in full swing deep into the night and the third one was at breakfast time when everyone was hung over.",

His great breakthrough was meeting the diva of fashion editors, Anna Wintour, at that time the assistant fashion editor at Harpers and Queen, who he regularly collaborated with to produce some of his best work, which continued years later after they both moved to New York.Central to his work is the concept of telling stories which he creates using casts of three or three hundred and extraordinary locations and props. He has recently re-emerged as an active photographer working on numerous magazine editorials with top fashion stylists.\n\nJim Lee moved seamlessly into directing TV commercials, his first film was for Levi\u2019s followed by several fashion and beauty commercials. In 2003/4 he had six photographs showing in the Ossie Clark retrospective at the Victoria and Albert Museum.\n\nsee also: http://www.jimleefilm.co.uk/",
