The jewellery worn in towns, which is often Ottoman in style, is frequently very different from that worn by the nomadic Bedouin, whose characteristic silver jewellery is much better known today.  \n\nThis chain formed part of a Bedouin woman\u2019s jewellery.  It was worn across the face, with the stud at one end inserted into the right nostril, and the hook at the other end attached to the wearer\u2019s headdress.  The habit of wearing nose jewellery was rarely found among urban women, and may have reached the Bedouin from India.  This item was bought for one shilling at the International Exhibition, London, in 1872, as an example of traditional Syrian jewellery \u2018worn chiefly by Beduins\u2019.  Its name was recorded as \u2018krimfli\u2019.",
