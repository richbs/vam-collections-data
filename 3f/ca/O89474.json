I was worked by May Morris, she took two years working me, her mother Jane Morris & her Aunt Bessie Burden & herself were the great workers who brought back good work to England in the years from 1860. Philip Webb delighted to give the design for me to May, he said the only woman in England who could work me.\n\nAnd about my travels & how I came to spend nearly five years in Paris. In April 1914 there was a Great Exhibition at the Louvre of the works of William Morris and his friends. I was out [?] & much admired amonst many other wonderful and beautiful things.\n\nThe Great War came in August 1914 we were all rushed down to the Great Cellars at the Louvre & walled up. For more than four years those who loved us never saw thought to see us again but we were kept warm & snug tho' the guns & raids were firing over head. In January 1919 I got home again, & so glad to be in my old corner.",
