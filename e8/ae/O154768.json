Pattern: wool;(see small crosses at edge of field for variation in diagonal directions);  Z2S; 8 colours: red, yellow, dark blue, blue, light blue, dark brown, black, cream; Sequence: over 2 warp threads and back behind one.\n\nSIDE FINISH: returned wefts.  Both bags are sewn together with decorative stitching in blocks of 7 colours including green (which does not appear on the bag face).\n\nEND FINISH: each end has 14 blocks of split tapestry in red, blue, and dark brown with bands of soumak.  Turned and stitched in place with the same decorative stitching as was used to assemble the bag.  There are 15 loops, one of them at the end; 8 are blue and red, 6 are natural wool, perhaps hair; 1 is a mixture of the two types.  These loops are along the top of one bag only and are stitched on with woollen thread of 2 browns plied together.  They are made from one long cord.\n\nDESIGN: bag face field: diagonal lattice filled with octagons outlined in red.  Each one is joined to the next by an oblong containing an X shape and each contains a hooked polygon.\n\nInner border: cream ground with red and blue stars and small triangles.\n\nOuter border: blue ground with red crosses.\n\nThe back: plain red tabby over paired warp threads with two bands of soumak in the middle.  (The red on the back is very banded).",
