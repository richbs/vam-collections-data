Full repeat 14.5 inches (37 cms). The border is finished at both ends and was presumably intended to be an insert in, or attached as a border to a light-weight cover or hanging.\n\nMade of fine cotton thread. The pattern and the narrow borders along the upper and lower edges are worked in the cloth stitch of the Halas lace school. The threads are darned in and out of one another to produce the effect of a piece of fine tabby woven muslin. The pattern pieces are outlined with a thick raised thread and are decorated with large openwork holes and with some decorative fillings. The main ground is worked with a decorative mesh formed of linked semi-circles, each of a single line of thread with linked buttonhole loops depending from it. A number of other decorative grounds are used to back each floral motif.",
