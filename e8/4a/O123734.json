He was a favourite of George William Frederick, Prince of Wales who, upon becoming George III in 1760, commanded Ramsay to paint all the official portraits of the new King and later his young Queen. In 1761 Ramsay became an official Painter to King George III.\n\nRamsay was known for his sensitive protraits of women. This painting, dating from about 1770 would have been undertaken towards the end of Ramsay's career. A crippling accident to his right arm in 1773 necessitated his retirement from practice. However, his studio continued to produce replicas of the Coronation portraits of the King and Queen.",
