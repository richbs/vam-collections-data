It shows a full length image of a woman in a costume loosely inspired by Russian 'folk dress'. She is dressed in a deep purple ankle length gown consisting of a sleeveless overtunic with a fitted bodice and flared skirt. The skirt of this tunic is decorated with a series of flame like patterns in deep red and gold and has a band of dark fur around the hem. There is a further vertical gold band decorated with intertwining gold spirals at the centre front and three rows of gold beads gathered into an oval disc suspended from each 'shoulder'. The underskirt fits tightly to her body. It has a dark crimson ground and bands of purple at the centre front and hem. Two further slim bands of purple fabric, trimmed with gold tassels are suspended from the waist of the dress. The design is signed Comelli and dated 1921. \n\nThe borders of design are bound in a transparent gauze which is pinned in place. A hand drawn chart detailing the measurements of the actress for whom the costume was intended is pinned to the rear. Also bound beneath the gauze at the rear of the design is a folded scrap of brown paper on which a detail of the back of the skirt has been drawn in pencil.\n[costume design] Additional detail of the flame shaped devices with which the hem of the overtunic is decorated. It shows a series of triangular motifs in gold, royal blue and red contained within one another with a central blue triangle on which there is a gold and green, feather like design.",

The story follows Sybil, a singer from Paris, who arrives in Russia and meets an officer, Petrov who falls in love with her. There follows a case of mistaken identity in which Sybil is thought to be the wife of the Grand Duke. The Grand Duke goes along with this deception and his wife pretends to be Sybil. The Grand Duchess then becomes attracted to Petrov and the Grand Duke tries to attack him. After much confusion everyone's true identity is revealed and the play ends happily.\n\nComelli (1858-1925) was the house designer of the Royal Opera House from the late 1880s to the early 1920s. During this period he also worked for the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and also designed costumes from a number of Gilbert&Sullivan productions.\n\nThis production of the play opened at Daly's Theatre, London on 19th February 1921.",
