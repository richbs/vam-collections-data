            "public_access_description": "This print made in 1764 illustrates the comedy drama written by Pierre Corneille in 1633 entitled 'La Galerie du Palais'. The play is set by the Palais du Justice outside which stallholders set up their goods for sale. The print shows some of the play's characters browsing at two different stalls; on the left a man Lysandre is browsing a book-seller\u2019s stall, while the women opposite, including Hippolyte and her companion Felice, are looking at lingerie. \n\nThe Palais de Justice arcade was from the seventeenth century one of the fashionable places to be seen shopping, but in literature shopping was represented as a leisure pursuit mainly for aristocratic men and linked to illicit sexual courtship. Consequently it was not seen as a socially acceptable environment for respectable women. This was changing by the mid-eighteenth century.\n\nThe eighteenth century saw a boom in consumer culture in France. Cheaper versions of luxury accessories and fabrics were available at increasingly affordable prices so that fashion became not just the preserve of the upper classes but was now available to middle and lower-class buyers. By the mid-eighteenth century the number of female consumers grew along with the variety and number of commodities and shopping became a leisure activity. Fashion retailers set up shop to entice women, with attractive front displays. Trade journals and literature of the time describe (and sometimes complain about) a new phenomenon of \u2018window-shopping\u2019 among female consumers, who caused much disruption often with no intention of buying anything. Indoor shopping arcades, built in Paris from the 1780s, made the environment for women shoppers more pleasant and respectable.",
