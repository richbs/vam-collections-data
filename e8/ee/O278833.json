Illustrated fig. 21, 207p.\n'...Another influential London dealer of the period; Daniell based in New Bond Street, also enjoyed good relations with the Coalport manufactory.  They provided the firm with design innovations and business advice, and also seem to have been very adept at obtaining Royal commissions.  Such a commission came in 1845 during the lead-up to the Crimean War when Tsar Nicholas I of Russia visited the Queen, staying at Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle.\nIn <i>The Clay Industries Including the Fictile and Ceramic Arts on the Banks of the Severn</i>, John Randall states: 'Messers Daniell received the command of the Queen to prepare a dessert service as a present by herself to the Emperor Nicholas, and it was manufactured at the Coalport works.  It was a magnificent service of 'bleau de roi' and had all the various orders of the Russian empire enamelled in compartments.'.\nThe Times said the service was:\n'...highly creditable to the manufactories of this country, and displays both in the shape of the various pieces of which it consists, the brilliancy of the colours, and the splendours of the gilding, a great advance both in the art of design and the mechanical processes involved in preparing the clay and producing the enamel of the surface'. \nThe design is clearly based on the Worcester Garter Service which we have seen already, (fig. 14, 1833) yet the British symbols have been replaced with Russian ones including the Orders of St George, Alexander Nevsky, St Vladimir, White Eagle, St Stanislas, and St Anne around a central double-headed Romanov eagle with the Order of St Andrew.  Today the majority of this service remains in the State Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg.'",
