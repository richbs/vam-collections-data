This necklace is made from plaques of silver, in an open floral design, set with poor quality rose-cut diamonds.  The design imitates aristocratic jewellery of the 18th century.  \n\nJewellery like this became common in southern Italy in the 19th century, but it has no deep tradition in the area.  Similar jewellery was worn in Malta, and throughout the Ottoman area of influence, including the Italian colonies in North Africa.  \n\nThis necklace was bought in Rome in 1895 as an authentic 18th century piece.",
