A framing band [a] of a floral green stemmed meander holding alternate orange and light blue or orange and grey and brown flowerheads.  Along the top and two sides, a wider band of red and orange 5-petalled rosettes alternating with 6-petalled buds in dark and light blue and orange accompanied by serrated green and yellow and brown leaf forms and red and orange isolated buds all on ground quilted with green silk in a scale-like pattern.  A repeat of [a] on these three sides leads into the central panel which is divided into a lobed arch and spandrels. The arch contains offset rows of isolated floral motifs echoing the border colouring.  The ground is quilted with the scale-like pattern. The arch is delineated in olive brown with a multi-coloured chevron infill. Just below the apex of the arch is a roundel containing an inscription and the date.  The spandrels are decorated with a lattice formed by simple leaves; within each lozenge is a small flowering plant.  There is evidence of under-drawing in black ink.\nEmbroidery Thread: green, orange, yellow, light blue, grey, brown, red, dark blue; 2S\nBacking: pieced; plain weave ochre-yellow cotton resist and block printed with off set rows of a floral motif in white, black, green, blue and red.  There is a white semi-circular flowerhead with a red centre and over this is a pair of small leaves and three short stems with red buds.\nFacing: bias-cut, black plain weave silk.\nAn almost identical prayer mat in the collection (818-1876) with a slightly different border contains the same date and may have been from the same workshop.",
