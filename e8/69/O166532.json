Upper: 15 cms. maximum and 13 cms. minimum of plain weave: first a 4 cm. band divided into 4 narrow bands as follows:\n1. plain weave, black weft;\n2 and 4. countered soumak over 4 threads and back under 2 in red and blue.\n3. plain weave with black weft and white woven pattern.  Above are 16 blocks of split tapestry, 7 cms. deep in browns, red and blues.  The intervening slits formed part of the fastening for the bags.  Above them is a repeat of the soumak and patterned bands.  The edge is turned along the second band of soumak and stitched in place.  NB.   The 'soumak' may have been embroidered on after weaving.\n\nDESIGN: Field: the field is a rectangle divided into four equal quarters by white and brown dotted lines which also surround the field.  The lower half has a red and the upper half a dark red ground.  On each quarter is angular branching in brown and blue from a central white octagon which contains an eight-pointed star.\n\nMain border: the dark blue ground on top and on both sides has a series of large eight-sided guls, each containing an eight-pointed star; the lower border has three red rosettes, the central one, hooked.  Both edges of the whole border are decorated by a reciprocal trefoil pattern in dark red and blue.\n\nOuter border: the brown ground has red crosses alternating with blue diamonds.  Below the pile is a repeat of the narrow bands of plain weave, 'soumak' and white patterning.\n\nThe back: there are broad and narrow bands of plain weave in dark brown, dark red, red and blue.  There are five bands with white patterning.\n\nThe middle section: eight (and parts of two more) double chevrons in dark brown, dark blue and red in plain weave.  At colour changes, the threads have been carried a little way over the back, forming a decorative outline.\n\nThe fastening: this is a cord of goat's hair which has been sewn on to form 15 loops and there is a plait of 53.5 cms.) maximum on the left (half has unravelled).\n\nDate catalogued: 1.3.95.",
