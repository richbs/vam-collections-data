She holds the stem of an object (now missing) in her right hand and supports Jesus with her left. She wears a separate crown with filigree decoration and set with eleven (originally twelve) stones. A blue stone is set in an oval at her neck. Christ also wears a separate crown applied with filigree and set with stones (eleven stones one of which is missing). He raises his right hand in benediction and holds a book in his left hand. Their throne is decorated with champlev\u00e9 enamel depicting the Virgin Annuciate on the left side and the angel Gabriel on the right side, with scrolling foliage and rosettes of blue, white, green and red. At the back a hinged gate with openwork decoration gives access to a cavity for relics. The gate is pierced with the symbol of a lily beneath an engraving of a romanesque arch.\n\nSome 19th century restoration includes part or all of the crown and some of the enamel at the back.",

In the Middle Ages these were generally believed to have miraculous powers and were greatly venerated. Reliquaries made to enclose relics might take many forms. Some reliquaries were shaped to represent the saint or various parts of the body such as an arm, head, foot or finger (so-called 'speaking image' reliquaries). Others were designed as a monstrance, which placed the relic on view inside a glass cylinder (monstrare= to show). \n\n Relics of the Virgin were considered to be the most holy, apart from the relics of Christ. Since Christians believed that after Mary's death, her body was carried up into Heaven (the Assumption), her relics were thought to be items, like her veil, that she had touched or worn during her lifetime.",

They were believed to be imbued with the holiness of the relic they preserved. The faithful believed that by touching a reliquary, they would receive some of this holy quality.\n\nReliquaries were central features of the Medieval Church Treasury. They symbolised the status and authority of the Church. Relics attracted pilgrims who made gifts and monetary donations to the Church in which they were held. Local people also gave in honour of their saint and to gain protection for themselves and their town. Thus relics could often give a sense of identity within the church community. Some reliquaries were used in religious precessions or festivals, which both involved the community and also reinforced the status of the Church.\n\nThis reliquary probably contained a relic relating to the Virgin Mary. The depiction of the Virgin annunciate and the angel Gabriel, reminded the believer of the Mary's virginity and her immaculate conception. The symbol of the lily, a sign of purity associated with Mary, further emphasises this theme.\n\nRelics of the Virgin were considered to be the most holy alongside relics of Christ. As Christians believed that after Mary's death, her body was carried up into Heaven (the Assumption), her relics were thought to be items that she had touched during her lifetime. These would be fragments of items such as her veil.",

            "historical_context_note": "The bones associated with the saints and the possessions associated with Christ are known as relics. In the Middle Ages they were generally believed to have miraculous powers and were greatly venerated.\n\nRelics were kept in containers called reliquaries. Reliquaries took many forms. Some were shaped to represent the saint or various parts of the body such as an arm or finger (so-called 'speaking image' reliquaries). Others were designed as a monstrance, which placed the relic on view inside a glass cylinder (<i>monstrare</i>= to show). Another style of reliquary, was the <i>tempietto</i> reliquary, which means \"little temple\". These receptacles had an architectural design in the form of a shrine or church. This reliquary may have been a 'speaking image' reliquary, containing an object associated with the Virgin Mary.",
