The idea of this series was to show an American soldier in the Vietnam war who had been rescued by a peasant girl and then took advantage of her. This shot shows the moment where he is apparently enjoying himself: it looks like an attempted rape and the soldier holds a gun in his right hand. However, the photographer suggests that it is an ambiguous image as it looks like she may be enjoying herself too. Jim Lee's motivation behind this image was to comment on the American involvement in the Vietnam war and those soliders who were 'having fun smoking pot and not taking the war seriously.'",

His great breakthrough was meeting the diva of fashion editors, Anna Wintour, at that time the assistant fashion editor at Harpers and Queen, who he regularly collaborated with to produce some of his best work, which continued years later after they both moved to New York.\nCentral to his work is the concept of telling stories which he creates using casts of three or three hundred and extraordinary locations and props. He has recently re-emerged as an active photographer working on numerous magazine editorials with top fashion stylists.\n\nJim Lee recently moved seamlessly into directing TV commercials, his first film was for Levi\u2019s followed by several fashion and beauty commercials. In 2003/4 he had six photographs showing in the Ossie Clark retrospective at the Victoria and Albert Museum.\n\nsee also: http://www.jimleefilm.co.uk/",
