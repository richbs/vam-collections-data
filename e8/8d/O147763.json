In her artist's statement Duigenan says:\n\n'The ghostly images have a multitude of referents and mange to hover between 'intimations of elegance' and downright quirkiness. Ultimately perhaps the dialogue they prompt has something to do with perfection and imperfection, residing somewhere between the smoothness and the wrinkles, and in the tension of close-knit and loosening threads...'",

The image is manipulated digitally before being printed out. This technique recalls the photogram technique practised by the earliest photographers such as William Henry Fox Talbot (1800-1877) and Anna Atkins (1799-1871) and revived by modernists including Man Ray (1890-1976) and Moholy-Nagy (1895-1946).\n\nDuigenan is interested in what she terms 'intimate archaeology' and uses the cameraless technique to reassess familiar things, here focussing on the material of nylon tights. By cropping the object she creates a semi-abstract image, drawing out the texture and accentuating the nylon's transparency and impermanence. The images suggest a dialogue between straight and wrinkled, perfect and imperfect - the tights simultaneously everyday and sensual.\n\nsee the artist's 'History of Stockings' at www.lensculture.com/nylon\nDuigenan draws on the history of the material and explains that synthetic fibres were first shown to the public at the New York World's Fair in 1939. The Du Pont company took the 'NY' from New York and 'lon' from London and called the fabric 'nylon'. The first nylon stockings appeared in New York stores in May 1940. Over 72,000 pairs were sold on the first day alone.",
