An early pair were supplied by the Jewel Office (a state department storing, lending and  buying silver for officials) to the Duke of Argyll in 1719. The first sauceboats were double-lipped, but forms which poured from one lip only became more popular after 1730. The sauce tureen appeared in about 1765 in response to the Neoclassical style and the fashion for vase shapes. Sauce tureens and sauceboats were often sold  in sets of four although one of the largest and grandest dinner services,  made for the Duke of Leinster  in 1745-1747,  contained ten sauceboats. This sauce tureen was part of additional silver ordered by the Duke of Wellington from the London goldsmith Robert Garrard to supplement the silver service presented to him by Portugal in 1816. The Portuguese service was a major diplomatic gift of thanks for the Duke of Wellington's victories over Napoleon in the Peninsular war and a celebration of the Triple Alliance between Portugal, England and Spain.",
