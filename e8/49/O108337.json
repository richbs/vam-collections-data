'Instructions on Needlework and Knitting' was a handbook for use in the Church of England charity schools run by the National Society. This particular book was probably a gift. It contains a letter from a Miss M.A. Smith to her governess thanking her for her teaching.\n\nThe pupils at whom this book was aimed would also have been shown how to sew and knit by a teacher. The instructions in early knitting books would have been difficult to follow for anyone unfamiliar with the craft. They did not supply information about needle size or which tension was best. Nor did they advise on how much or what type of yarn to use. Notation was not standardised, so the knitters would have relied greatly on their own judgement when interpreting these patterns.",
