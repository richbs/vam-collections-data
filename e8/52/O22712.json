After the War, they were reluctant to commit themselves to the considerable start up costs for a new range of stainless steel cutlery. It was only when the Council of Industrial Design intervened and suggested that they amalgamate their resources in a joint venture with the Sheffield firm of Walker & Hall that the design and production of this service got under way. David Mellor, a former colleague of Welch at the Royal College of Art and the consultant designer to Walker & Hall collaborated with Welch on the design. Initially, it was intended that the basic manufacture would take place in Sheffield; the cutlery would then be sent to Old Hall for finishing and polishing. In the end, Walker and Hall undertook all manufacturing processes and supplied Old Hall with the finished product. Walker & Hall sold it as 'Spring'; Old Hall as 'Campden', after the location of Welch's studio. In spite of the fairly advanced design with short knife blades, it sold well, but the split identity was confusing and from thenceforward Old Hall decided to stick to exclusive patterns.",

After the War, they were reluctant to commit themselves to the considerable start up costs for a new range of stainless steel cutlery. It was only when the Council of Industrial Design intervened and suggested that they amalgamate their resources in a joint venture with the Sheffield firm of Walker & Hall that the design and production of this service got under way. David Mellor, a former colleague of Welch at the Royal College of Art and the consultant designer to Walker & Hall collaborated with Welch on the design. Initially, it was intended that the basic manufacture would take place in Sheffield; the cutlery would then be sent to Old Hall for finishing and polishing. In the end, Walker and Hall undertook all manufacturing processes and supplied Old Hall with the finished product. Walker & Hall sold it as 'Spring'; Old Hall as 'Campden', after the location of Welch's studio. In spite of the fairly advanced design with short knife blades, it sold well, but the split identity was confusing and from thenceforward Old Hall decided to stick to exclusive patterns.\n[Eric Turner, 'British Design at Home', p.145]",
