Pupil of B R Haydon, with Charles Landseer, from 1816, and entered RA Schools 1820. Exhibited 38 works at the RA between 1828 and 1862, 135 at the BI 1824--64, and 47 at the SBA 1824-35. Most of his paintings were still-life, usually fruit, but he occasionally showed portraits and subject pictures. Called by the Athenaeum critic (17 May 1856, p622) 'the very prince of fruit-painters'. Died Sunnyside, near Birkenhead, Merseyside, 18 June 1864. His studio sale was at Christie's 27 May 1873. There is a miniature portrait of him by Thomas Carrick in the V&A (Pl-1953). His daughter, Miss E Lance, was also a painter of fruit, exhibiting at the RA 1859-61; Sir John Gilbert and William Duffield were his pupils. \nLIT: \tArt Union 1847, p96 (with engr portrait after G Clint): Art Journal 1857, pp305-7; Illustrated London News 21 December 1861, pp647-8 (with engr portrait); Art Journal 1864, pp242-3 (obit) \n\nFruit \nFA86 Neg 72354 \nCanvas, 35.5 X 43.1 cm (14 X 17 ins) Signed and dated 'G L 1842' bl \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \nExhibited at the BI in 1843, the size given in the catalogue as 24 by 28 inches (including the frame, as was usual).
