His early work reflects the style of the artist and illustrator Charles Rickets (1866-1931). During the early twentieth century Philpot became popular as a portrait artist. Always concerned that his style would become stale he chose different poses and techniques for these works. Constantly dissatisfied with his work, Philpot travelled to different places including Paris, North Africa and Venice. The portraits that Philpot is best known for present a cross-section of early twentieth century, from his portraits of admirals during the First World War to the portraits of dancers from the Ballet Russes of the 1920s. \n\nThis  early drawing by the artist, possibly executed whilst he was studying at Lambeth School, shows him exploring the possibilities of the human form. The dramatic pose of a male nude standing facing out while turning his upper body and head back with his right arm raised up is heightened by the strong shading that is used on the right leg, head and under the right arm.",
