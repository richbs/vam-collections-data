The top of the boot is hollowed out to form a container.  The collar of the boot forms the lid. This box has the added feature of two carved faces. Decorative snuff boxes would be put on the table and passed around a social group.\n\nOwnership & Use\nTobacco smoking became fashionable during the late 16th century. Tobacco was also ground into a powder to form snuff, which was sniffed through the nose rather than smoked in the form of a cigar or through a pipe.  By the 18th century hundreds of varieties of snuff were available, some scented with oils. There was a revival in the popularity of snuff-taking after about 1850.\n\nThis snuff box was owned by the artist Talbot Hughes (1869-1942), who had a large collection of historic dress and accessories. The London department store Harrod's bought the collection and gave it to the Museum in 1913 after displaying it in the store for three weeks.\n\nDesign & Designing\nShoe-shaped snuff boxes were made throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, probably as gifts. This boot, with its squared toe, is in the fashion of the 1860s. Shoes were traditionally associated with good luck wishes for travellers and wedding couples setting off on the 'journey' of marriage. Silver-coloured shoes are still sometimes used at weddings as good luck tokens.",

            "history_note": "This object was part of a very large collection of 752 items of dress and accessories which was given to the Museum by Harrods, the department store, in 1913. The collection had been formed by Mr Talbot Hughes, an artist  (address Ginge House, Wantage). Cecil Harcourt Smith of the V&A had suggested to Harrods that they bought it and gave it to the Museum, which they did, both for the publicity, and for the 'public good'. A large firm in America had been going to buy the whole collection and present it to the Metropolitan Museum, New York, but Hughes did not want it to go abroad. Harrods paid \u00a32,500 for it. It was shown for three weeks at Harrods in December 1913. Harrods also prepared a short catalogue, which included the following about the snuff boxes: 'Many of pique work of metal pins in minute geometric patterns...They principally date from the latter part of the 18th and the early years of the 19th century'. Talbot Hughes had written a book on the history of dress based on his collection, and illustrated with photographs of models wearing some of the items.  The snuff boxes were not illustrated or discussed at any length.  There is no official gift form on the acquisition RP, but the Textile Department Registered Descriptions (T.391-1143-1913)  records that the agreed formula for the labels was 'Messrs. Harrod's Gift, 1913'. There is a long list of about 2000 items included in the gift, including many snuff boxes, but it is not clear whether all the snuff boxes came to the Museum. Other snuff boxes on the list included those made of porcelian, slate, ivory, meatl, and lacquer.  It appears that the Museum selected the parts of the collection that they wanted to acquire.",

            "historical_context_note": "The style of boot, with its square toe, appears to date from the 1860s (Lucy Pratt, Textiles Dept. 1999). \n\nSnuff is a form of ground tobacco, and originally came from America in the 15th century. Snuff-taking became popluar as an alternative to smoking tobacco.  By the 18th century, hundreds of varieties of snuff were available, some perfumed with scented oils. Snuff was either sniffed from the back of the hand, pinched in the fingers and sniffed, or sniffed from a spoon. Snuff-taking was less popular in the early 19th century but enjoyed a revival later in the century.\n\nThere were many varieties of snuff-boxes in many materials, but among wooden boxes, shoe-shapes were popular both in the 18th and 19th centuries. Decorative boxes were designed for table use at home, \n\nShoes have long been associated with love and marriage, such as the silver-coloured shoes sometime use to decorate wedding cakes, and shoes tied to wedding cars. Shoe-shaped snuff boxes might have been made as gifts. (Pinto, 1969)",
