What they do have to be is bold, but most stand up to scrutiny as excellent examples of the maker's craft. The wiring of the elaborate letting is extremely skilful, as is the  overlaying with the gold braid, which would have taken much patience to coax around the curves and angles.  The style is accurate, down the accent over the first 'E'.  \n\nOliver Messel (1904-1978) was Britain's leading theatre designer from the early 1930s to the mid 1950s, working in every aspect of entertainment - ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue - as well as in interior decoration and textile design.  His lavish, painterly and romantic designs informed by period styles, were perfectly in tune with his times and earned him an international reputation.  By 1960, however, Messel's style had become unfashionable, having no sympathy with the new 'kitchen sink' school of theatre.  He increasingly concentrated on non-theatrical painting and designing and eventually retired to the Caribbean, where he began a new career designing and building highly idiosyncratic luxury villas.",

            "history_note": "This stylized decoration was designed for the 18th century opera <i>Z\u00e9mire et Azor</i>, by Andr\u00e9 Ernest Gr\u00e9try, performed by the Bath Festival Society at the Theatre Royal, Bath, 1955.  \nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's remaining designs and artefacts (many designs were sold or given away during the artist's lifetime).  The collection was briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being placed on indefinite loan to the V&A Theatre Museum from 1981.  The Oliver Messel Collection was purchased from Lord Snowdon in 2005 with the aid of the Heritage Lottery Fund, The Art Fund and the Friends of the V&A.",
