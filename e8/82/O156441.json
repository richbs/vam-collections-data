One of the earliest extant examples would appear to be a box of 1768/69 by Piere Francois-Mathis de Beaulieu, now in the Musee Louvre (Grandjean, 1981, no. 19), but the greatest number date from the mid 1770s to the mid 1780s. The technique is a refined imitation of moss agate, which stone and its artificial copies were very popular in France in the eigtheenth century for its distinctive markings that resembled tree branches (see Truman, 199,  cat. no. 105 and Snowman, 1990, pl. 496-97, 680). Indeed, a series of designs for imitation \"aborifications\" for use under glass was published by Mondere and Briceau in about 1770. The painting on the Gilbert box, and on many made in Paris, sought to reorganise the random natural markings on moss agate into a definite subject. It is, as it were, art bettering nature.",
