This toy is ca 1960 and was sold under the Codeg tradename.  Codeg is the tradename for Cowan de Groot, founded in 1919, an importer of goods from around the world, the imports included large numbers of tin plate toys from Japan and Germany, which were available in large numbers.  As with many toys of this period the box graphics are more interesting and higher in quality than the toy its self, which is of quite cheap manufacture.    \nIt is about the time that this toy was made that the Telephone operator became defunct as they were replaced by an automatic direct dialing system.  The operator\u2019s job was to connect calls on a switchboard with a plug system.  Being in complete control of the call, the operator was in a position to listen to private conversations. Automatic, or Dial systems were developed in the 1920s to reduce labor costs as usage increased, and to ensure privacy to the customer. As phone systems became more sophisticated, less direct intervention by the telephone operator was necessary to complete calls.",
