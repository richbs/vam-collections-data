By the first half of the 19th century it was the main centre of production for small silver items in the region.  The silversmiths specialised in popular and devotional jewellery.  They sold their work at markets throughout the Alpine region, and at major international trade fairs all over Europe.  \n\nThis ring would have been worn by a woman.  The picture of a flower may mean that it was given to her as a love token.  The reverse painting technique is typical of south Germany, as is the diagonal banding on the shank.  It is marked on the outside of the shank with the unicorn\u2019s head mark of Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd, and the silver mark 12.",
