            "public_access_description": "This drawing on beaten animal skin has an inscription identifying its subject as Sheikh Hasan Chishti. The members of the sufi Chishtiyya order in Mughal Hindustan were close to the emperors, and Jahangir (r. 1605-1627) was given the name of Salim at birth in 1569, after Sheikh Salim Chishti who had predicted the birth of a son to Akbar.\nThe drawing would have been used as a tracing, to copy the outlines onto paper for a finished painting. The colours that should be used are indicated in black ink annotations.\nA closely similar, fully worked painting in opaque water colour and gold is preserved in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (55.121.10.26). It has inscriptions purporting to demonstrate that this is the work of the Jahangir-period artist Bichitr, and that it depicts 'Sheikh Hasan Chishti Jahangiri'. However, it is a later copy of the early 17th century original, probably done in Delhi or Lucknow in about 1800. Several similar copies of earlier Mughal paintings are preserved in the V&A, and in the Metropolitan Museum.",
