The complete outfit consisted of a black wool hat, a khaki cotton shirt, a string vest, cotton twill trousers, the belt and leather shoes. It reflected a style of \u2018yardie\u2019 dress worn by some Jamaican men in the 1980s.\n\nThe term \u2018yardie\u2019 derives from the slang name given to occupants of government yards in Trenchtown, a neighbourhood in West Kingston, Jamaica. Trenchtown was originally built as a housing project following devastation caused by Hurricane Charlie in 1951. Due to the poverty endemic in the neighborhood, crime and gang violence became rife, leading the occupants of Trenchtown to be in part stigmatized by the term \u2018yardie\u2019. The military style of this outfit reflects the time spent by some Jamaican men doing military service in Castro\u2019s Cuba.",
