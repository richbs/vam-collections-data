From right to left two figures, one sitting, the other standing by pierced rocks, are attentive to a bearded kneeling figure with a hat; further a net-looking tree hovers over a pagoda towards flaming clouds; the next figure stands between two wing-like rocks; finally a Chinese house enclosing two seated figures backs onto large rocks cut in two by a coarse cloud band. The well without inner rim band is painted with two groups of paired geese, back to back, and separated by a branch. Two sets of lotuses and elongated flaming leaves with blades of grass act as divides. The subject is a simplified version of the painting outside bowl 1090-1876. A white egret stands in the centre of the bowl surrounded by rhythmical blades of grass and flowering plants. A label inside the base ring reads no. 2921. Most details are transfers from Chinese motifs.",

Four scenes decorate the outside; from right to left two figures, one sitting, the other standing by pierced rocks, are attentive to a bearded kneeling figure with a hat; further a net-looking tree hovers over a pagoda towards flaming clouds; the next figure stands between two wing-like rocks; finally a Chinese house enclosing two seated figures, back onto large rocks cut in two by a coarse cloud band. The inside rim is painted with two groups of paired geese, back to back and separated by a branch. A white egret stands in the centre of the bowl surrounded by rhythmical blades of grass and flowering plants. Such wares were produced in the 17th century for an increasingly demanding European export market.",
