They were printed with oil-based colours instead of the water-soluble pigments that had previously been used in wallpaper manufacture. This meant that they could be washed to remove dirty surface marks. Often sanitary papers were varnished to make them even more hard-wearing.\n\nSanitary papers were usually hung in kitchens, sculleries, stairwells, passages and hallways. Most consisted of pictorial patterns (see E.1943-1952). Some were designed to imitate other washable surfaces, such as marble, mosaics or ceramic tiles. This sanitary paper was designed in a fashionable style for the more expensive end of the market. Such examples are relatively rare. Wylie & Lochhead, a wallpaper manufacturing company based in Glasgow, employed Arthur L. Gwatkin as an \u2018in-house\u2019 designer.",
