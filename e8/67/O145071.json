The recessed upper section comprises a central cupboard fitted with two glazed doors, lined with pink pleated silk; flanked by two pigeon-holes each over a small drawer. The right drawer is partitioned to form three small compartments at the left, the back one with a slope from front to back, and a single main compartment. No fittings (ink bottles etc.) survive.\nAbove the pigeon-holes are two blind lunette-shaped cavities, and behind these a serpentine-topped board which spans the full width of the superstructure, forming a top to the whole.\nThe whole is made largely of mahogany, including all three drawers and the backboard of the frieze-drawer cavity. [CHECK the backboard to the superstructure and the top board in better light.] The legs are fitted with square socket brass castors. \nAll is veneered in satinwood, with pale stringing and rosewood(?) cross-banding, except for the legs which have dark (ebonized rather than ebony?) stringing. The front face of the top lunettes are inlaid with shells in pale wood against a green-stained ground. The six visible blockings at the top of the legs are also inlaid with shells in oval surrounds, in similar woods.",
