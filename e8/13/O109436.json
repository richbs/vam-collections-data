            "history_note": "This is a rare late 17th century example of the medieval form for a chalice and is embellished with fashionable cut-card work, made from applied sheet silver. Its maker, Jacob Bodendeich, came from north Germany and was one of the leading goldsmiths in Restoration London.  It is similar in form to the pair of chalices given to St. Mary's Lambeth in 1639 by the then rector Dr. Daniel Featley. This was then the form of chalice preferred by William Laud, and the Kingswood chalice represents a further revival of this form. It was not until the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 that churches could again use a Gothic chalice.\nThe arms engraved on the chalice and paten (a chevron with a label of three points; crest, a man's head affrontee, wreathed, on an esquire's helmet) have been identified as those of the Stephens family of Epsom (see Cooper, 1902). The identification was presumably suggested by the fact that members of this family are buried locally, in Chipstead Church, among them one Anthony Stephens, who died in 1695. While it is tempting to imagine that Anthony presented St Andrew's Kingswood with this chalice and paten, two factors militate strongly against this. The first is that the Kingswood church of St Andrews was only built and consecrated in the mid-nineteenth-century. The second is that the arms of the Stephens family as officially recorded do not correspond to the arms engraved on the chalice and paten. It seems the chalice and paten had no local connection, but were purchased to furnish the newly-founded church in the nineteenth century. The arms engraved on these objects remain unidentified (Bouchard, 2012).",

Like his contemporary Bishop Lancelot Andrewes, he regarded the Anglican church as a purified form of traditional Catholicism. Together they set out to restore the ceremonial that had been abolished with the Reformation of the previous century, including the high altar and the use of candles and incense.\n\nLaud\u2019s intentions, however, were seen by Parliament as an attempt to overthrow the Protestant religion and in 1645 he was beheaded.
