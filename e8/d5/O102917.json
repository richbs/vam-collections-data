The close personal and professional relationship between Tweed and Rodin is discussed in the monograph on Tweed by Lendal Tweed. Tweed and his family first visited Rodin in 1902 and this relief may date from this time. Lendal Tweed writes: '...but it was only with the growing friendship with Tweed that his [Rodin's] reputation began to spread considerably on this side of the Channel. It is not too much to say - and Rodin himself freely acknowledged it - that to John Tweed more than to any other man was due the high opinion of the French sculptor that persists in England today...' (Tweed1936, p. 98).\nRodin's gift to the Museum in 1914 of eighteen examples of his work - presented in admiration of British soldiers fighting alongside his countrymen - was instigated primarily by Tweed (Mus. nos. A.33 to A.50-1914).",
