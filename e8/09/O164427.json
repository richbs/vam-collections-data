Around the bottom edge there is a pronounced skirting into which the pilasters are set. The boarded lid is plain. There is an iron lock-plate in the centre of the front top-rail but no key-hole in the wood behind. Inside there is a box fixed to one side which appears much newer than the rest of the chest.  The interior of the back boards also look fresh.Some of the pilasters are much rubbed and worn.",
