            "public_access_description": "Jane McAdam Freud is a sculptor and medal-maker whose work explores and challenges the traditional definition of a medal. This piece is derived from a commemorative Christmas medal in bronze, commissioned from Jane McAdam Freud by Sir John Paul Getty Jnr and his wife, Victoria, to be given to members of their staff, but here it is produced in stone clay (terracotta). However, it conforms to the traditional concept of the portrait medal in having an image of a person on the primary face (obverse) and a message on the reverse alluding to a specific moment in time - in this case the conference organised by the British Art Medal Society in Manchester which took 'The medal as gift' as its central theme and at which this medal was presented to a Curator from the V&A for its collection. The inscription 'MAN.U from me' combines a resonance of a significant aspect of Manchester's identity -  Manchester United football team - with the fact that the medal is a gift. In fact at the conference, the maker gave examples of her work to five private individuals and to five museum curators for their collections.",
