            "history_note": "The geometric design on this dish is the most original of the group of floral and incised geometry wares identified by Y. Crowe; the most sophisticated group of Persian ceramics of the Safavid period (see Crowe, 2002, nos.166-176 for further examples). Geometric compositions and flowers with occasional birds decorate most of the large dishes. The design of these dishes is similar to those painted in the Chinese <i>Anhua</i> style (meaning secret or hidden decoration), a fine incised ware which first appeared in China in the Yongle period (1403-1424). Patterns of these wares are sometimes moulded.\n\nHistorical significance: This type of ware was produced during the reign of Shah Abbas II (1642-1666) which falls within the so-called <i>Transitional</i> period in Chinese ceramics which lasted from approx. 1620-1683 when the kilns at Jingdezhen resumed their production of imperial orders for the Qing court. <i>Literati</i> and merchants became a new clientele, purchasing the new blue and white wares, which also found its way abroad to Persia as export wares. The influence of the <i>Transitional</i> style on Safavid ceramics replaced that of the <i>Kraak</i> wares.",

            "historical_context_note": "The unique Persian contribution to this style is the combination of various geometric patterns, with incised contours emphasised in blue. The plain-coloured glaze which usually covers the outside of the dish may indicate a connection with plain-glazed vessels, both Chinese and Persian of the same period.",
