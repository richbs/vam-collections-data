            "public_access_description": "Dorothy Macready starred in this production of Cinderella as the Fairy of the Slipper. Her early roles were mainly in pantomime in and around London, including Red Riding Hood at the Kennington Theatre. She made her name as Oak Sapling in Maeterlink's Bluebird of Happiness at the Haymarket Theatre which opened in 1909 and ran for 402 performances. During this period Dorothy was recommended to audition for Diaghilev's Ballet Russes. Until this time the company only contained Russian dancers; Dorothy Macready and her friend Hilda Boot were the first English girls to be accepted into the Company. She left after a season, deciding to not travel to Paris on tour with them, but did capitalise on having been with the company. She appeared in many provincial theatres appearing as 'late of the Russian Ballet' and a 'Speciality Dancer'. At this time she joined the Jessica Black Company in Chelsea and soon became a lead role in the Sexton Blake melodramas which toured Britain. In 1916 she formed her own company to perform 'a farcical trifle' named 'The Water Cure' and became a successful business woman who secured contracts with leading agents including Moss Empires. At the end of 1917 she signed a dancing contract with the H.B. Philips Opera Company (known as The Carl Rosa after 1917) and also took the position of assistant stage manager. Dorothy stayed with them until 1921 when her marriage to Martin Haw marked the end of her stage career.",
