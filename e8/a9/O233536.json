The Society was founded in 1836 by a group of men with a common interest in numismatics, the study of coins and medals.  Although the Society's jubilee coincided with that of Queen Victoria, the loyalties of the Society clearly lay more with their president, John Evans, than with their sovereign; in the position normally occupied by the monarch during such a year, on the obverse or front of the medal, sits Evans instead.  President of the Society from his election in 1874 until his death in 1908, Evans was an example of Victorian entrepreneurship, academic achievement and business acumen on a remarkable scale.  Of wide interests and huge ability, he became an eminent archaeologist and numismatist, as well as a successful paper manufacturer, holding high office in many learned societies and publishing widely.",
