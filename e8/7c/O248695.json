These theatres have plans typical of the period and reflect Chambers's interest in theatre design. The detailed notes show a deep knowledge of all aspects of both front-of-house and backstage practicalities.\n\nChambers moved to London in 1755 and published his influential Treatise on Civil Architecture in 1759.  Chambers demonstrated the breadth of his style in buildings such as Gower (later Carrington) House and Melbourne House, London, in such country houses as Duddingston, Scotland, and in the garden architecture he designed for Wilton House, Wiltshire, and at Kew Gardens. He became head of government building in 1782, and in this capacity built Somerset House, London.",
