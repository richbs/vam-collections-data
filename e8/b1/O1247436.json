            "public_access_description": "Beatrix Potter is one of the world's best-loved children's authors and illustrators. She wrote the majority of the twenty-three original Peter Rabbit books between 1901 and 1913. The Tale of Peter Rabbit (Frederick Warne, 1902) is her most famous and best-loved tale.  \n\nBeatrix Potter was twenty-seven years old when she wrote and illustrated the story of Peter Rabbit on 4 September 1893. It was written not as a book but as a letter to Noel Moore, the five year old son of Beatrix's former governess Annie Moore (n\u00e9e Carter). Noel was recovering from an illness so Beatrix amused him with a story inspired by her pet rabbit, Peter Piper: 'I don't know what to write to you, so I shall tell you a story about four little rabbits, whose names were - Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and Peter\u2026'.  \n\nAs Annie\u2019s family grew Beatrix wrote letters to Noel\u2019s younger brother and sisters, including stories of an \u2018excessively impertinent\u2019 squirrel called Nutkin and a disconsolate frog, Mr. Jeremy Fisher. In 1900 Annie suggested to Beatrix that the letters might contain ideas for several children\u2019s books.  Fortunately the children had kept all their letters carefully. Beatrix selected Noel\u2019s story of Peter Rabbit for her first published book and copied the text and illustrations onto folded sheets of thin paper.  The letter includes 17 illustrations, most of which were reworked for the published story.  Beatrix also lenthened the story, adding new illustrations and details such as the famous rabbit pie and Peter hiding in the watering can and sneezing.  \n\nWhen the manuscript of 'The Tale of Peter Rabbit and Mr. McGregor's Garden' was finished it contained one colour frontispiece and forty-two black and white illustrations.  At first, the manuscript was rejected by publishers so Beatrix privately printed the book in an edition of 200 copies under the new title, The Tale of Peter Rabbit in December 1901, with a second edition of 250 copies in February 1902.  By then Frederick Warne had agreed to publish the book and Beatrix reworked the story again, this time shortening the text and reducing the illustrations to thirty colour illustrations and a colour frontispiece.  The Tale of Peter Rabbit was published in October 1902 in an edition of 8000 copies; by the end of the year a further 20,000 copies had been printed.\n\nBeatrix claimed that the secret to the success of The Tale of Peter Rabbit was that it was written to a real child, not 'made to order'. This charmingly illustrated letter encapsulates something of the genius of Beatrix\u2019s imagination.  With a fresh and intimate narrative voice, she draws deeply from her lifelong passion for natural history to conjure a tale of fantasy rooted in reality. The subtle interplay of text and illustration controls pace, creates suspense, and reveals an elegant, very English irony that has come to characterize so much of her work.",
