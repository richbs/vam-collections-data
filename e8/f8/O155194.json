Harold Kyrle Bellew (1855-1911) is drawn as Olivier, the son of Robespierre, played in this production by Henry Irving. The play was a translation by Laurence Irving of the original French play written expressly for Irving by Victorien Sardou.\n\nHarold Kyrle Bellew (1855-1911) was an English actor born in Lancashire, who made his first appearance on the stage in Australia in 1874 but acted with Irving at the Lyceum from 1878 to 1880, Irving's earliest seasons at the Lyceum. He spent much of his later career in America, where he died, but was with Irving in 1899 for Robespierre at the Lyceum and the subsequent tour. He made a reputation as the most handsome man on the contemporary stage, and a critic in Harper's Weekly once wrote of Bellew, 'He poses and struts, yet one has to confess that his poses are graceful, and his struttings recall a pleasurable memory of days gone by.'",
