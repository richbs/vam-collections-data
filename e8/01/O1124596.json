            "public_access_description": "The Museum has a small collection of wooden toys designed and made by the craftsman, Sam Smith (1908-1983). His work has been described as \u201csculpture toys for grown-ups\u201d, for they were not really made to be played with by children. However, they are interesting pieces of wood-carving, making clever use of additional materials such as string, beads and printed paper. They were made to be admired for their craftsmanship and also, in most cases, to make you smile. \n\nThe little boats and buildings are Sam Smith\u2019s first experiments in toy-making after World War II. He became well known for his boats, a typical example being the boat lent by Lady Dale, seen here. He did not make straightforward models but liked to show the characters of the boats; and, as you can see, the boat \u201cLiberty\u201d contains a very free and easy crew!\n\n\u201cTmith\u201d, the centrepiece of this group, is a typical example of Sam Smith\u2019s later work. He began making such sculptures around 1955, and by the 1970s they had become quite large, with unusual themes.\n\nSam Smith was born in 1908 in Southampton.  He had always wanted to be an artist and studied at Bournemouth, and alter Westminster Art Schools. He struggled to make a living during the Depression of the 1930s, doing odd jobs, whilst exhibiting his paintings in galleries and art clubs. However, it was as a result of seeing an exhibition of folk toys from around the world at the Little Gallery \u2013 the only craft gallery of its kind in London at the time \u2013 that he began making small, often humorous wooden items. \n\nAfter the Second World War, he continued making wooden toys, particularly boats. A display of these at the opening of the Festival Hall was spotted b y an American business man. It was he who subsequently introduced Sam Smith\u2019s work to the States. Here, his toys became popular in the 1960s, being exhibited at the Museum of Contemporary Crafts in New York amongst other venues. His work was not recognised in Britain until the 1970s.\n\nSam Smith lived above Dartmouth Harbour in Devon, close to his first love \u2013 boats. He died in 1983. There are examples of his work at the Bristol Museum and Art Gallery, Rochdale Art Gallery and in the Crafts Council Collection, London.",
