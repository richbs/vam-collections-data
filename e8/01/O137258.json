The long oval blade which forms the body is slightly ridged along its centre creating the back bone of the animal and giving the piece a pleasing sense of balance and symmetry. The handle swoops upwards in a graceful curve to form the neck, finishing with an accurately detailed head with silver eyeball, flattened skull and ridged beak. The texturing of this server exhibits masterly skill. The feather pattern engraving on the blade and handle create a highly effective natural texture and the polished detailing along the back and beak beautifully offset the rougher surface. This simple design strikes a successful balance between beauty and function.",
