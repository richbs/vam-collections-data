An example of the influence that Oliver's trip in 1596 to Italy  had on him, it is a virtuoso performance of chiaroscuro, or 'light and shade', rendered in monochromatic colouring, with subtle gradations from grey into grey-black, and delicately touched with white, gold and silver. The figure emerges from the shadows enveloped in billowing veils and with an elusive and enigmatic half smile reminiscent of Leonardo's Mona Lisa. These veils would have been a form of \u2018undress\u2019, and with the lady's gesture of hand on heart, indicate that this is a private love token. \n\nUnfortunately the red pigment used at that time for painting features fades easily, and here one can only imagine the striking effect the colour of her cheeks and lips would have had, seen within the cool monochrome of this elegant work.",

Full Citation:\n\n\u2018ISAAC OLIVER\n\n<b>271 Unknown Lady</b>, 1596-1600, formerly called Frances Howard, Countess of Somerset\n\n<i>Victoria & Albert Museum (P.12-1971)</i>\nVellum stuck to a plaing card, circular, 130 mm, 5 1/8 in. diam.\n\nThis miniature is one of Oliver\u2019s largest and finest painted from life.  From its first appearance at the close of the 18th century it was identified as Frances Howard, Countess of Essex and alter Countess of Somerset (1593-1632), the notorious beauty whose career came to an end at the discovery of her murder by poison of Sir Thomas Overbury.  Her iconography is thin but the oil portrait that depict her do agree in terms of the grey eyes and fair hair.  To be her, however, the costume would have to be not earlier than 1609, when, at sixteen, she took up her role in court life in Jonson\u2019s <i>Masque of Queens</i>.  Enveloping veils  similar, but not identical, to these occur in pictures about 1615 (e.g. Gheeraerts Catherine Killigrew, Lady Jermyn, dated 1614, Strong, <i>The English Icon</i>, pl. 285 (no. 278)).  This is deceptive for the real dating of the miniature depends on the dress beneath which can only be 1590\u2019s.  The line of the sleeves and outersleeves, with their narrow lace cuff and the farthingale, are paralleled exactly in the Ditchley Portrait of Elizabeth I, c. 1590-92 (ibid, p. 289 (285)).  It is a silhouette which lasts throughout the 1590\u2019s but which is suddenly abandoned with the new reign, when sleeves went tight upon the arms.  The hair, which is composed almost into a halo surrounding the head with tiny ringlets near the ears, is similarly a feature of the 1590\u2019s (e.g. ibid, p. 278, (no. 265), 295 (nos. 296-297)).  The miniature is no doubt intended as a love token because her hand is placed on her heart as in Hilliard\u2019s <i>Young Man Among Roses</i> (no. 263 [P.163-1910]).  The veils may be a fashionable form of \u201cundress\u201d because to complete her formal attire she would discard the veils and add a fan-shaped ruff and adorn her hair with a jewelled head-dress. \n\nUntil now the dating of the miniature has always been to the Jacobean period, based on the inaccurate identification of the sitter and on a parallel miniature of another lady of the same size, that of Lucy Harington, Countess of Bedford, (no. 274), the costume for which, however, is correct for 1615.\n\nThere is no reason why Oliver should not have repeated the effect a decade later.  His style and technique did not change and it is no argument as to date.  The V&A miniature is one of Oliver\u2019s masterpieces, revealing the infinite variability of his work far beyond the narrow confines of Hilliard who produced nothing comparable in the 1590\u2019s.  It is faded which, to an extent, must be taken into account for, originally, the impact of the carnations of the face and rose of the lips must have been even more striking in contrast to the virtuoso <i>chiaroscuro</i> essay that dominates the image, conceived in terms of grey into grey-black with touches of white and highlights of gold and silver.  The sitter was clearly a lady of high rank but we have not clues as to her identity.\n\nThe concern with <i>chiaroscuro</i>, the figure emerging from the shadows, the elegance and sophistication of the composition and the elusive half-smile of the sitter would indicate that it was painted shortly after Oliver\u2019s Italian visit of 1596 and with a strong recollection of North Italian painting in the form of Leonardo, his followers and Correggio.  This one of the first works of English art to respond directly to the art of the Italian Renaissance since Holbein.  In this miniature we have surely the Elizabethan response to a tradition that stems from Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s <i>Mona Lisa</i> through the works of his followers in the Milanese School.\n\nThe features have faded and the silver has oxidized in some areas.\n\nINSCRIBED: Signed bottom left: <i>IO</i> in monogram; inscribed on the reverse in the hand of Horace Walpole: <i>The Lady Frances Howard Countess of Essex and Somerset, by Isaac Oliver; from the collection of James West, president of the Royal Society, H. W. 1773.</i>\n\nCOLLECTIONS: James West (1704?-1772); sold at Langford\u2019s 27th February 1773 (lot 74): \u201cA large and remarkable fine haead of the Countess of <i>Somerset</i>\u201d; bought Morgan, \u00a33.17.6; Horace Walpole at Strawberry Hill (<i>Description of the Villa\u2026at Strawberry Hill</i>, 1774, p. 98); sold Strawberry Hill sale, May 9th 1842 (13th day) (lot 52); bought by the 13th Earl of Derby for 18gns; Earl of Derby at Knowsley Hall; sold Christie\u2019s June 8th 1971 (lot 80); purchased by the V&A with the aid of the N.A.C.F. and the Pilgrim Trust.\n\nLITERATURE: George Scharf, <i>A Catalogue of the Collection of Pictures at Knowsley Hall</i>, 1875, p. 131 (no. 234).\nV&A, 1947 (18).\nPope-Hennessy, <i>Lecture</i>, 1949, pl.
