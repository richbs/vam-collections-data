Madder-dyed woollen cloth, bound at the top and sides with green woollen cloth, with appliqu\u00e9 ornament executed in shaped pieces of prepared cottons of various tints, coloured woollen fabrics, white cotton ric-rac and copper sequins. Some details are painted in Indian ink and watercolour.\n\nThe subject of the applique-work may illustrate one of the Jataka stories (stories of the Buddha's 550 previous incarnations). To the left is a Palace in which are seated a Princess and a Prince, whilst an attendant ushers in a noble and another man who stand outside beneath a richly foliated tree. To the right the same Royal pair are seated in a large saloon with the noble and the other man to right and left. The deep border is formed of wavy leafy stems and horsemen.\n\nThe figures are dressed in the elaborate costumes of the Konbaung Dynasty.",

Kalagas  with religious themes were used in the Buddhist Temples of Burma on high  festivals and on account of their rarity were lent to different temples as needed. \n\nBritain's control of Burma extended as the 19th century progressed, and the country was  annexed in 1885. The extravagant style of kalagas appealed to Burmese and Europeans alike and their popularity soared in the middle of the 19th century.\n\nThe costumes of the figures are depicted in the stylised tradition of Burmese theatre relate to the fashions worn in the Mandalay Court of about 1880. The kalaga itself dates to the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries.",
