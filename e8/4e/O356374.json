The collection had been formed by Mr Talbot Hughes, an artist  (address Ginge House, Wantage). Cecil Harcourt Smith of the V&A had suggested to Harrods that they bought it and gave it to the Museum, which they did, both for the publicity, and for the 'public good'. A large firm in America had been going to buy the whole collection and present it to the Metropolitan Museum, New York, but Hughes did not want it to go abroad. Harrods paid \u00a32,500 for it. It was shown for three weeks at Harrods in December 1913. \n\nThese shoes were acquired as having been once owned and worn by Queen Victoria (reigned 1837-1901). The collection also included a pair of black satin shoes embroidered with crowns associated with Queen Adelaide (1792-1849) which were transferred in November 1922 to the Government of South Australia.
