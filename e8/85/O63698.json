Ivory silk & cotton winders used by Taglioni in her travelling \u00e9tui.\"  (S.802-2001)   The winders (unnumbered) have been returned to the \u00e9tui.  \nThe box is part of a unique collection of memorabilia and personal effects which evoke Marie Taglioni in the last decades of her life.  She was a keen needlewoman and  the collection contains examples of her own work, her personal sewing accessories and related gifts she made to Margaret Rolfe, whose interest in sewing was evidently negligible.  \nA collection of Taglioni memorabilia was amassed by Margaret Rolfe, the granddaughter of Taglioni's closest friend in London, Mrs Boggs Rolfe; she attended Taglioni's dancing classes and received many gifts of Taglioni memorabilia, from Taglioni herself, from her grandmother and, after Taglioni's death, from her niece, Marguerite Troubetzkoi.  She kept these, with a series of related notes, in various boxes and annotated envelopes (filed separately).  These she passed to Cyril Beaumont, probably for the London Archives of the Dance (a number of the objects were referred to in \"The London Archives of the Dance and some of its Treasures\" by Cyril Beaumont, Ballet Annual, first issue, Adam & Charles Black, London, 1947, p110); the Archives never achieved an independent home and part of the collection, including the Taglioni memorabilia, was stored with Cyril Beaumont, where it became inextricably mixed with his own collection and came to the Museum as part of the Cyril Beaumont Bequest.",
