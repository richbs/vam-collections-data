An inventory of the collection of Philippe, duc d'Orl\u00e9ans, Regent of France (1674-1723), dated 1723, lists rare \u2018porcelaine blanche de Perse\u2019, which may have been inherited from his father, Louis XIV. Other examples were in the Royal collection at Dresden, identified as Chinese porcelain in the 1779 inventory, as well as elite households in The Netherlands. Although made of crushed quartz, white clay and frit (powdered glass ), the last ingredient added to lower the firing temperature, these plain fritwares resembled true white Chinese porcelain imported from Dehua at the same time. The shapes, however, are different and are specific to Iranian customs, including ewers, small dishes, wine cups, rose water sprinklers and water-pipe bases for smoking tobacco. Dutch East India Company agents referred to Iranian ceramics exported through Bandar-e Abbas, as \u2018Gomron\u2019 or \u2018Gombroon\u2019 ware, a reference to this main trading port on the Persian Gulf, then known to Europeans as \u201cGombroon\u201d.",
