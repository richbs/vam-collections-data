His solution was to add reinforcing ridges and an internal lip, which gave the bowl extra rigidity.Therefore the articulations used in this design had a functional as well as aesthetic purpose.  Other versions of this design were made with ivory handles.\n\nPeople\nUnlike his contemporaries whom he saw as indulging in pictorialism and historicism for the sake of their superficial romantic associations, Dresser attempted to investigate the formal properties of the objects he admired.  He developed fresh designs following on from his own  instinct for natural functional forms, which he believed to be appropriate to contemporary requirements.",
