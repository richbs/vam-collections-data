Wornum was a great advocate of using historical ornament as the basis for teaching. In 1856 his book entitled Analysis of Ornament (Chapman &amp; Hall) reviewed the development of ornamental styles throughout history and classified ornament by various elements such as 'acanthus', 'scroll' and 'palmette'. He taught that the basis shapes of these historical forms should be followed and applied to modern design.",
