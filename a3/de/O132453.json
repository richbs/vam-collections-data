He trained with his father, Hubert Drouais (1699-1767) and then with Donat Nonotte (1708-1785), Carle van Loo (1705-1765), Charles-Joseph Natoire (1700-1777) and Fran\u00e7ois Boucher (1703-1770). He became a member of the Acad\u00e9mie Royale in 1755 and achieved quickly a great success as a portrait painter, receiving prestigious commissions, especially from the court.\n\nThis painting is a portrait of the Dauphine Marie-Antoinette, consort of the future king of France, Louis XVI, at the age of 17. It depicts the princess in a lavish court dress adorned with sumptuous jewels. This portrait was used as a model for a  tapestry made in the Royal manufactory of the Gobelins by the Cozette father and son in 1775. This portrait is a good example of French state portraits of the 18th century and the representation of an almighty royalty about to fail in a few years time.",

Before 1800</u>, London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, p. 88-89, cat. no. 88\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"Fran\u00e7ois-Hubert DROUAIS (1727-75) \n<i>French School</i>  \nA Parisian portrait-painter of high repute, he lived and died in Paris, where he was the pupil of his father, Hubert, the miniaturist, and also of Van Loo and Boucher. He also painted genre pictures and <i>f\u00eates champ\u00eatres.</i>  \n\n88 \nMARIE ANTOINETTE, QUEEN OF FRANCE (1755-93), \nWHILE DAUPHINE, IN 1773, \nAT THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN \n<i>Canvas</i>  \n25 x 20 1/2 (63.5 x 52) \nJones Bequest \n529-1882 \n\nThis painting served as a model for a tapestry portrait made by Michel-Henri Cozette in 1774 (Bordeaux, Chambre de Commerce; Vuaflart, ii, 1910, pI. xxvi), which is inscribed <i>Drouais Pixt. en 1773</i>(left); <i>Cozette exit. en 1774</i>(right). Drouais painted a larger portrait of Marie Antoinette as Hebe in 1773 of which the head is very similar to that in 529-1882 (Chantilly, Mus\u00e9e Cond\u00e9; Vuaflart, ii, 1910, pl. xxiv), and another portrait in the same year, also similar but less closely related, now in the Museum at Versailles (see exhibition catalogue, <i>Marie Antoinette,</i>Versailles, 1955, no. 26). \nDoubt has been cast on the attribution to Drouais on the grounds of the painting's 'mediocre quality' (Flammermont, 1898; Dorbec, 1905). Yet its condition is such (see below) that its original quality can no longer be accurately ascertained. Parts of it, indeed, for example the outline of the hair and the bow formerly at the back of the neck, can only be reconstructed with the aid of the tapestry. Vuaflart and Bourin (1910) attributed it to Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Cozette, father of Michel-Henri, and suggested that he painted the cartoon for his son's tapestry himself, basing his study of the head on the Drouais portrait of Marie Antoinette as Hebe at Chantilly. This hypothesis was supported by reference to Cozette's own letters. The tapestry was commissioned by the financier and court banker, Nicolas Beaujon, and in a letter dated 5 October 1774, to d' Angivillers, the <i>Directeur des B\u00e2timents,</i>Cozette p\u00e8re complained that he was not wholly satisfied with Drouais' portrait, but that they had used it as a model: 'c'est celui dont nous nous sommes servis, en profitant de certaines observations que j'ai faites plusieurs fois, en examinant la Reine \u00e0 son diner. Mon fils vient de finir sous mes yeux ce portrait.' Vuaflart and Bourin interpreted this as suggesting that Cozette used the Drouais at Chantilly, modified it from his own observation and prepared his own cartoon - i.e. 529-1882 - for his son's tapestry. \nThis is an interesting and plausible hypothesis, but it cannot be sustained by the available evidence. Pierre-Francois Cozette is recorded as having executed paintings on rare occasions (G. Leroy, 'Le Tapissier Cozette' in <i>R\u00e9union des Societ\u00e9s des Beaux Arts des Departements,</i>xxiii, 1899, p. 137) but there is not a single work extant with which 529-1882 could be compared. Nor does the passage quoted necessarily indicate the existence of a cartoon by Cozette himself; the 'certaines observations' he introduced could equally be accounted for by the minor differences in the features and expression between the painting and the tapestry. The fact remains that the tapestry is clearly inscribed as being derived from a painting by Drouais and, until further evidence comes to light, this must be taken to refer to 529-1882, with which it is practically identical. \n\n<i>Condition.</i>Cleaning in 1964 revealed that the original paint surface is badly worn throughout, and in places down to the canvas. The worst area of damage is at the hair, at the top and down the right side, at the ear and neck at the right side. \n<i>Prov.</i>John Jones ; bequeathed to the Museum in 1882. \n<i>Lit.</i>P. de Nolhac, <i>Marie Antoinette, the Dauphine,</i>1896 (repr. frontispiece, in an imaginary frame, as by Drouais); J.

Victoria & Albert Museum, HMSO, London, 1990. p.xix-xx\n\nJohn Jones (1800-1882) was first in business as a tailor and army clothier in London 1825, and opened a branch in Dublin 1840.  Often visited Ireland, travelled to Europe and particularly France.  He retired in 1850, but retained an interest in his firm.  Lived quietly at 95 Piccadilly from 1865 to his death in January 1882.  After the Marquess of Hertford and his son Sir Richard Wallace, Jones was the principal collector in Britain of French 18th century fine and decorative arts.  Jones bequeathed an important collection of French 18th-century furniture and porcelain to the V&A, and among the British watercolours and oil paintings he bequeathed to the V&A are subjects which reflect his interest in France.  \n\nSee also <u>South Kensington Museum Art Handbooks.  The Jones Collection.  With Portrait and Woodcuts</u>.  Published for the Committee of Council on Education by Chapman and Hall, Limited, 11, Henrietta Street. 1884.  \n<u>Chapter I. Mr. John Jones</u>.  pp.1-7.\n<u>Chapter II. No.95, Piccadilly</u>.  pp.8-44.  This gives a room-by-room guide to the contents of John Jones' house at No.95, Piccadilly.\n<u>Chapter VI. ..... Pictures,... and other things</u>, p.138, \"The pictures which are included in the Jones bequest are, with scarcely a single exception, valuable and good; and many of them excellent works of the artists.  Mr. Jones was well pleased if he could collect enough pictures to ornament the walls of his rooms, and which would do no discredit to the extraordinary furniture and other things with which his house was filled.\"\n\nHistorical significance: This painting appears to be one of several versions derived from an earlier portrait of Marie-Antoinette as Hebe, goddess of youth, executed by the same painter Drouais for Louis XV of France in 1772 and currently in the Mus\u00e9e Cond\u00e9, Chantilly. \nThe present painting reuses the exact same pose and face but with different garments. 529-1882 portrays the Dauphine, Marie-Antoinette (1755-1793), consort of the Grand Dauphin Louis and future Queen of France, in a lavish court dress embroidered with a rose pattern and sumptuous jewels, which appears quite rare in Marie-Antoinette's iconography. \nDespite the scepticism of the critics at the time about this series of portraits, which lack of vitality and likeness, the paintings achieved quite a great success and 529-1882 was probably chosen as the model for the tapestry made by the Cozette father and son in the Gobelins Manufactory (Chambre de Commerce et d'Industrie, Bordeaux), which is inscribed on left with \"Drouais pit en 1773\" and, on the right, with \"Cozette ext en 1774\". In fact, the tapestry reproduces the exact same garments and jewels as the V&A painting. The tapestry was commissioned by the financier and court banker, Nicolas Beaujon (see letter dated 5 October 1774, to d' Angivillers, <i>Directeur des B\u00e2timents</i>).\nDrouais' portrait was also used as a model for a series of painted portraits executed by the copyists of the 'Cabinet du Roi' in order to multiply the effigy of the Dauphine - see the portrait of Marie-Antoinette, Inv. MV 3891, Mus\u00e9e National du Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles et de Trianon, which is a copy after Drouais prototype with variations of garments. This practice was usual in portraiture since the Renaissance and facilitated the diffusion of the royal image by painters who therefore did not need to have a direct contact with the sitter.",

            "historical_context_note": "In his encyclopaedic work, <i>Historia Naturalis,</i> the ancient Roman author Pliny the Elder described the origins of painting in the outlining of a man's projected shadow in profile. In the ancient period, profile portraits were found primarily in imperial coins. With the rediscovery and the increasing interest in the Antique during the early Renaissance, artists and craftsmen looked back to this ancient tradition and created medals with profile portraits on the obverse and personal devise on the reverse in order to commemorate and celebrate the sitter. Over time these profile portraits were also depicted on panels and canvas, and progressively evolved towards three-quarter and eventually frontal portraits. \nThese portraits differ in many ways from the notion of portraiture commonly held today as they especially aimed to represent an idealised image of the sitter and reflect therefore a different conception of identity. The sitter's likeness was more or less recognisable but his particular status and familiar role were represented in his garments and attributes referring to his character. The 16th century especially developed the ideal of metaphorical and visual attributes through the elaboration of highly complex portrait paintings in many formats including at the end of the century full-length portraiture. Along with other devices specific to the Italian Renaissance such as birth trays (deschi da parto) and wedding chests' decorated panels (cassoni or forzieri), portrait paintings participated to the emphasis on the individual.\nPortrait paintings were still fashionable during the following centuries and extended to the rising bourgeoisie and eventually to common people, especially during the social and political transformations of the 19th century. At the end of the 19th century and during the 20th century, painted portraits were challenged and eventually supplanted by the development of new media such as photography.",
