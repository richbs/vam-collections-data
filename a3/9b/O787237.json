Drawing as a discipline</b> \n \n[\u2026]  \n  \n<b>DRAWN COPIES FROM THE ROUND</b>   \n \n[\u2026]\n \n<b>84.</b> Sir (Samuel) Luke Fildes, KCVO, RA \n(1843-1927); British  \nStudy of a plaster cast foot \nSigned and dated <i>L. Fildes</i> and <i>S. L. Fildes \nDec 1st 1863</i> with the blind stamp of the \nScience and Art Department, inscribed <i>15438</i> \nBlack and white chalk on buff paper. \n39.4 x 40 cm \nVAM E.1951-1909 \n \nFildes drew this study shortly after entering \nThe National Art Training School, (now the\nRoyal College of Art) with a scholarship, after \nthree years training at the Warrington School \nof Art. The first state run art school, the \nLondon School of Design, was opened in 1837 \nwith the intention of training artisans and  \nsupplying employees for industry. Sub- \nsequently similar schools were opened in pro- \nvincial towns. At first, in opposition to the \nAcademy Schools no drawing from casts was \npermitted but the syllabus was, nevertheless, \nbased on drawing from other approved  \nmodels. By the time the Schools of Design had \nbeen superseded by the Schools of Art, such \nacademic training was, as is shown by this \nexercise, encourages.\u2019",
