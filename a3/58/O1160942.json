T-Rexstacy (much like Beatlemania before it) gripped the country between late 1971 and 1973, and during 1972 sales of T-Rex albums and singles made up 6 per cent of British record sales.  This pocket mirror would most likely have been sold at a concert, although T-Rex didn't play in the United Kingdom between the end of 1972 and early 1974; instead they toured Europe, Japan and America throughout 1973.",
