The complete outfit consisted of a black satin and tulle bra top with gold metal jewellery, quilted satin zipped chaps, these shorts (all by Pascale for Against All Oz); a quilted satin bag (Philippines) and leather shoes by Office Shoes. The outfit reflected a style of \u2018Ragga\u2019 dress worn by some British women in the mid 1980s.\n\n\u2018Ragga\u2019 derives from the word \u2018Raggamuffin\u2019, originally a derogatory term for delinquent Jamaican youths. Ragga began in the mid-1980s in Jamaican dancehalls before spreading throughout the African diaspora. It marked a stark contrast with Rastafarianism through its flamboyant dress and celebration of individual wealth, sexuality and success. \n\n\u201cWe wanted a kind of Cowboy look so we made the chaps and carried the dance hall style through with gold buttons. Girls were wearing things like Wonderbras so we decided to make it in a Chanel-style quilted fabric with a sort of bustier top. I\u2019d wear it with a pair of black shorts but a lot of girls would wear it with just a G-string under the netting\u2019 (Pascale).",
