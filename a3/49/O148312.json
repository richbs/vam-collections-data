David Wilkie was commissioned by Mehmet Ali to paint his portrait, and Lewis also sketched him and members of his family. Lord Elphinstone, Governor of Madras, mentions this portrait in a letter to Lewis\u2019s brother Frederick Christian in Mysore, dated 24 September 1845.  \u201c...I had again the pleasure of seeing your elder brother on my way out last winter. He was living in the most Ottoman quarter of Cairo \u2013 in a house which might supply materials for half the Oriental Annuals and manuals of Eastern architecture that appear in London & Paris.  He showed me a very spirited sketch of Mehemet Ali \u2013 the best, & in fact, the only good likeness I have seen, & I saw it within a quarter of an hour of leaving the original. \u2026\u2019",
