The delicacy of these scales suggests that this object belonged to a goldsmith and was used to weigh small items such as coins or jewels. The design of the object plays upon the significance of scales and balance. The figures, running from the lion and the mythical faun at the bottom to the wealthy gentleman at the top, represent the balance of society.\n\nThe craftsmanship has been attributed to the workshop of Wenzel Jamnitzer, who became a master goldsmith in 1534 in Nuremberg. Although this object does not bear Jamnitzer's mark, certain aspects of the piece are in the style of the goldsmith, who made casts of insects, shells and plants. The intermingled figures at the base of the balance standard resemble the border of a dish made by Jamnitzer in the Louvre. The masks and figures amidst detailed decoration are also reminiscent of Jamnitzer.",

Although this object does not bear Jamnitzer's mark, certain aspects of the piece are in the style of the goldsmith, who made casts of insects, shells and plants. The intermingled figures at the base of the balance standard resemble the border of a dish by Jamnitzer in the Louvre (Rosenberg, pl.25). The masks and figures amidst detailed decoration are also reminiscent of Jamnitzer.\n\nThis balance standard is closely related to another in the V&A (M.21-1953). The dragon balance and intermingled figures on the stems have many sylistic similarities. Part of the base has been taken from the same mould. This could indicate that they were made in the same workshop.\n\nAnother balance standard which has many similarities with this example is in the Cleveland Museum of Art. This standard, complete with scales, has a related figurative design. The lion masks at the base of the stem can also be found on the V&A standard. The style of the Cleveland Standard has been compared both with Jamnitzer and Peter Floetner, a goldsmith also working in Nuremberg in the 16th century (d.1546). Jamnitzer and his school sometimes used models made by Floetner in their work.",

            "historical_context_note": "This balance standard, its scales now missing, was once used as a weighing device. Merchants used scales to measure out coins for payment and also items being sold, such as jewels or precious metals. Scales signified trust between the merchant and the buyer. They showed that merchants were using official measures. Thus the act of measuring was very important in maintaining commercial confidence. However, the scales themselves also had to be reliable. In Renaissance Italy scale makers were licensed to ensure that these objects were made honestly.\n\nScales had a strong symbolism in the Renaissance period. They were used by churches and town halls as symbols of civic importance and supervision. The allegorical figure of Justice was represented throughout this period carrying scales. This object reflects the symbolic meaning of scales and balance. The figures, from the lion and the mythical faun at the bottom to the wealthy gentleman at the top, seem to represent the balance of society.\n\nThe delicacy of these scales suggests that this object belonged to a goldsmith and was used to weigh small items such as coins or jewels. The craftsmanship of this balance standard would have served to advertise the quality of the goldsmith's wares. Goldsmiths are often depicted wearing expensive jewellery and clothing in this period, an indication that signs of wealth were important for their business.",
