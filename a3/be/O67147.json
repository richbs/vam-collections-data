The leather has been stitched with a diamond pattern across its surface.  The stool has four turned legs which taper towards the bottom.  Originally there would have been chromed metal feet attached to the ends (see cabinet W.4A-1988 which as chromed metal discs on the ends of its legs).  On the upper section of each leg two applied wooden details form a 'capital' - this is purely decorative, but appears to be a structural detail formed by the stretchers extending through and beyond the leg itself.",

            "history_note": "This stool was designed by Ern\u00f6 Goldfinger for the north London home of Mr and Mrs Benroy, 1 Graham Road, Hendon.  It was used as a dressing table stool in the bedroom and was part of a bedroom suite that included two bedside tables, a bed, a work table (W.4A-1988), light fittings and built in wardrobes.  Mrs Evelyn Benroy later lived in a flat in St John's Wood where she continued to use this stool and other furniture from Graham Road until her death in 1988.  Black and white photographs of the Graham Road interiors show that the stool was originally upholstered with goatskin(?).  It is not known precisely when or why the stool was reupholstered with the current white leather cover.  Mr Benroy was Ern\u00f6 Goldfinger's stockbroker and one of a number of friends/clients for whom Goldfinger designed interiors in the 1930s.",
