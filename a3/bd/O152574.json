            "public_access_description": "Bentwood furniture was first developed during the 1830s by the Austrian Michael Thonet (1796-1871).  By the 1850s he had perfected a technique of cutting, planning and steaming or soaking straight-grained beechwood logs before drying, sanding and finishing them for assembly into chairs and tables.  In 1856 Thonet was presented with the Imperial monopoly patent which lasted 13 years and saw his firm Gebruder Thonet become the largest and most successful mass-producer of furniture in history.  \n\nBy the time the patent came to an end in 1869 other Austrian manufacturers had already started building factories to produce bentwood furniture and from that point onwards the market became much more competitive.  By the 1890s bentwood furniture was a global phenomenon with more than fifty companies worldwide producing a huge variety of objects ranging from chairs and tables to prams, beds and easels.\n\nCoat stands were yet another bentwood form available to the consumer.  This example is similar in design to one illustrated in Thonet\u2019s 1904 catalogue.  However, in the absence of any stamp or maker\u2019s mark and given the fact that many of the firms copied each other\u2019s designs it is difficult to attribute this model to one company in particular.",
