The calendar was introduced by the Pirelli tyre company in 1964 as a trade publication featuring women in 'glamour' photographs and it quickly became a cult item. \n\nEach year the company chooses one of the world's top photographers to shoot the calendar. In 1985 the theme of the calendar was 'Fashion' and photographer Norman Parkinson shot models Iman and Anna Andersen wearing accessories and clothes featuring the tyre tread pattern.\n\nKnown for his mastery and superb millinery technique, Graham Smith was a fitting choice to create the hats for this Pirelli shoot. Smith studied at Bromley College of Art and the Royal College of Art. At the beginning of the 1960s he moved to Paris to work for the house of Lanvin-Castillo, then later returned to London where he worked for Michael of Carlos Place. In 1967 Smith set up his own business in Mayfair, becoming one of Britain's leading milliners.",

Fourteen leading British Designers were invited to make clothes and accessories using the tyre tread design. These commissions represented a significant break-away from the traditional Pirelli Calendars and resulted in an unusual and stylistically powerful collection. The dramatic photographs were taken by Norman Parkinson. At the Calendar launch the collection was auctioned for charity and later the owners generously gave these unique works to the V&A.\nThe Mannequins and display are by the Creative Team of Adel Rootstein Hopkins Ltd.\nThe display will be in the Dress Collection from 5th November 1986 to Autumn 1987. It is divided into two parts, one on either side of the Dress Collection at the entrances from Rooms 21 and 47 respectively.",
