            "public_access_description": "Salt was a symbol of purity in the 16th century and was held in often beautiful and elaborate containers also known as salts.  This ceremonial salt, known as a \u2018bell salt\u2019, can be broken down into three sections comprising two salt cellars and a small caster. Bell salts superseded the more imposing drum salts and pedestal salts, for both decorative and domestic purposes, by the end of the 16th century.  While the earliest surviving bell salts date to the 1590s, inventories show that they were in use long before this date. \n\nThis piece is an example of 16th century domestic silver. Such silver was both functional and ornamental. Objects for dining and drinking took elegant forms and were decorated in the latest styles. Beautifully crafted items intended only for display often adopted functional forms such as cups and dishes. Domestic silver was not confined to the most wealthy. Many people owned silver spoons or mounted vessels, items which often became treasured possessions.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
