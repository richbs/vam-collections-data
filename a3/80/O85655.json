It has long sleeves which flare out from the shoulders down. The collar is tubular. The bottom of the sleeves show triangular motifs in tones of bright orange and rust. The jacket fastens down the front with bright red buttons, sewn on a ribbon of rust-coloured corded silk. The jacket has two pockets on the front, edged with the same kind of ribbon.\n\nThe dress is short, sleeveless and made of bright yellow angora wool. It has a V-cut neckline which is outlined with a rust coloured band made of corded silk. It has the smallest cap sleeves. The waist is low, at hip-level, and has loops for a belt.
