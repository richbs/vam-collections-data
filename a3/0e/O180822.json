The will specified a sum of money for \"some of my particular friends\u2026\u2026to buy each of them a Ring to remember me their poor friend and servant by.\" Bromley chose to commission a large beaker rather than the specified and more usual ring. Obviously it must have been permissible in society at the time to act in this way. The object and associated documentation throws an interesting light on the mourning customs of the early 18th century.\n\nThe beaker comes with an unbroken family provenance.",

The will specified a sum of money for \"some of my particular friends\u2026\u2026to buy each of them a Ring to remember me their poor friend and servant by.\" Bromley chose to commission a large beaker rather than the specified and more usual ring. Obviously it must have been permissible in society at the time to act in this way. The object and associated documentation throws an interesting light on the mourning customs of the early 18th century.\n\nThe beaker comes with an unbroken family provenance.",
