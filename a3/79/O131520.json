            "public_access_description": "This ensemble from Jacques Heim's Spring 1967 collection is called 'Aubepine'. The straight-cut dress in heavy white lace is lined in blue chiffon and silk. The blue silk high-waisted coat is sleeveless and has a cutaway front to show the lace dress. A young woman attending a society wedding might have worn a formal day outfit like this. It was worn with a dramatic blue rose hat also in the Museum's collection (see T.133:1 to 3-1998).\n\nJacques Heim launched his couture business in the 1920s. In the 1940s he was one of the first couturiers to sell ready-to-wear clothing in boutiques. In 1957, Heim struck a deal with the London manufacturer R.L.Salmon Ltd. They bought the exclusive rights to reproduce Jacques Heim's Paris collections for a British audience. Twice a year, the couture house sent them sketches and materials for Spring or Autumn collections. The final results were approved by Heim before the clothes went to high-end London boutiques.",
