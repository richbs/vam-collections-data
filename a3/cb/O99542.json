Some of these prints were highly fanciful inventions, which were not seriously intended as models for production. The design for the shape of this ewer, the body, handle and spout, is taken from plate 10 of  \"Livre de Vases\", published in 1667 after drawings by the French painter Jacques Stella (1596 - 1657).  \nThe ewer and basin were made in the Duc d'Angoul\u00eame's porcelain factory, Paris. In 1781 Christoph Dihl (1752-1830), Antoine Gu\u00e9rhard (d.1793) and his wife Louise-Fran\u00e7oise-Madelaine Croiz\u00e9 (1751-1831)  established a factory under the protection of the then only five year old Duc d\u2019Angoul\u00eame (1775-1844). This Royal patronage allowed the factory to  manufacture coloured and gilt porcelain which had been monopolised by S\u00e8vres since 1766. It operated first at Rue de Bondy,  Paris moving in 1789 to rue du Temple. The factory enjoyed success and continued after the Revolution. The factory suffered financial difficulties in the early-19th century eventually leading to closure in 1828.",

In 1910, to mark the opening of the new buildings designed by Aston Webb, he presented his collections of French porcelain and Dutch faience. Several other departments were also beneficiaries of his generosity.\n\nBorn in 1836, Joseph Henry Fitzhenry was a prodigious art collector and dealer. He was a friend of the art collectors Sir Richard Wallace, George Salting and J. Pierpont Morgan, to the latter of whom he provided advice on purchases. According to his obituarist, 'Nothing is certainly known about Mr. Fitzhenry\u2019s origin or early life'. Fitzhenry was a founding member of the V&A\u2019s Advisory Council, attending only one meeting before he died in London on 15 March 1913, aged 77. He was buried in Brompton cemetery.",
