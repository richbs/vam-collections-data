This is the second one, published in 1582, and is comprised of ten prints including the title page. Though it represents the last of Hans\u2019 publications, it is also the first dated plates engraved by his son Adriaen, who would continue to an illustrious engraving and publishing career of his own. Each image shows a pendant in the shape of a sea creature and topped with humans, dieties or merpeople. The pendants dangle from delicate ribbon work and are each hung with three pearls. It is possible that the bodies of the sea creatures themselveves were made out of baroque pearls. Baroque pearls were famous for their irregular shapes and were prized in the early modern world as the basis for elaborate jewellery designs such as the ones seen in the Collaert series.",
