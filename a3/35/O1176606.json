His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nMessel\u2019s painterly and poetic interpretation of medieval period costume and architecture complemented Christopher Fry\u2019s verse play, The Lady\u2019s Not For Burning (1949), about a woman wrongly accused of witchcraft in a small English market town around 1400.  Fry's first play to be presented at a West End theatre, it won critical acclaim; one critic hailed it as \u2018a poetic fantasy of rare splendour and delight.\u2019 (The Times, 10 November 1950).   \n\nClaire Bloom played the role of Alizon Eliot. Ivor Brown said she was as \u2018pretty as a May morning\u2019 (Observer, 1 May 1949).",

It was directed by John Gielgud and Esm\u00e9 Percy and featured John Gielgud as Thomas Mendip, Pamela Brown as Jennet Jourdemayne, Claire Bloom as Alizon Eliot and Richard Burton as Richard.  It was also performed at the Royale Theatre, New York, on 8 November 1950.  \n\nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's theatre designs and other designs and artefacts.  The designs were briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being housed at the V&A from 1981 on indefinite loan.  The V&A Theatre Museum purchased the Oliver Messel collection from Lord Snowdon in 2005.\n\nHistorical significance: Association with Christopher Fry's abortive poetic drama movement.",
