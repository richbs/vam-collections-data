Above this the painting is topped by a wooded landscape in which four pinkish domed and turreted buildings may be glimpsed. The young woman has matted hair which flows over her shoulders and reveals her left ear in which she is wearing a rounded <i>kundal</i> earring. Her pale complexion is consistent with the ash-smeared skin associated with Shaivite ascetics. She is wearing a flowing brown cloak over an orange robe. She has bangles on her wrists and a large beaded necklace round her shoulders over her cloak, beneath which is slung an encircling band with geometric decoration of a possible metallic material. Between her outstretched hands she is clasping a rosary. Pairs of diminutive birds, heron-like in the right hand lower corner and partridge-like midway up the left hand side, can be seen amid the exotic flowering plants around her.",
