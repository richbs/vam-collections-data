            "public_access_description": "The German-born artist Kurt Schwitters (1887-1948) was influenced by Dada, a cultural movement that started life in Zurich during the First World War of 1914-1918 and developed principally in France and Germany. Dada was deliberately nonsensical and anti-art, largely reflecting the disillusionment felt by many at the insanity of the war itself. However, this particular work was produced at a moment at which Schwitters was out of favour with his fellow Dadaists. The sticker, which he had specially made for the front cover, reads Vorsichte: Anti-Dada (Warning: Anti-Dada). The Title 'Merz 8'  derives from the word Kommerz (Commerce). Schwitters first used it in a painting in 1919, having 'cut and pasted' - the collage principle common to the Dadaist movement. He subsequently applied it as a collective noun to all his work, which included painting, poetry and three-dimensional assemblages.",

            "bibliography": "Timmers, Margaret (ed), <i>Impressions of the Twentieth Century: Fine Art Prints from the V&A's Collection</i>, London, V&A Publications, 2001\nThe full text of the entry is as follows: \n\n\"<b>Kurt Schwitters (1887-1948)</b> \n\n<i>Merz 8 Die Kathedrale</i> (Merz 8 - The Cathedral), 1920 \n\nThough he began his career as a painter, Schwitters very soon adopted collage and assemblage as his primary strategies for making art.  He created collages from discarded paper fragments of all kinds - sweet wrapper, tram tickets, packaging, fragments of newsprint and illustrations from magazines.  In his collage compositions these abject materials are simply themselves - they do not aspire to the status of the illusionist tricks found in Cubist collages.  Schwitters was associated with Dada, the radical anti-stylistic movement that encompassed a range of art forms and practices, but he worked in relative isolation from the movement's political manifestations.  In 1920 he had fallen out with fellow Dada artists when he was refused permission to exhibit in the Berlin Dada Fair at the Burchard Gallery, and was also snubbed by George Grosz.  In retaliation he had stickers printed for the cover of <i>Die Kathedrale</i>, which was already in the press.  They read 'Vorsicht [Beware]: Anti-Dada'. \nThe term 'Merz' was itself arrived at through the collage method.  It first appeared as a word fragment, taken from an advertisement for a 'Kommerz und Privatbank' (commercial and private bank) in a painting of 1919.  Schwitters adopted it as a collective noun for all his work, including painting, poetry, his three-dimensional architectural assemblages (the 'Merzbau') and his publications.  The lithograph plates in <i>Die Kathedrale</i> are a mix of drawing and collage processes.  It appears that Schwitters nailed fragments of embossed papers and pieces of shoe leather to wooden blocks, used transfer papers to take rubbings from these, added drawn elements and transferred the resulting image to lithographic stones.  As a whole the volume is a compendium of Schwitters' various artistic practices and concerns, incorporating oblique references to his allegiances within the art world and quoting the title of his famous poem <i>An Anna Blume</i>.",
