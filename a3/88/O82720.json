Holmes, p. 247, who did not know of the inscription on the back, dates c. 1824.  Constable\u2019s journal, however, shows that he was in London on 22 May in that year.  If the place represented is indeed Brighton the sketch may have been made in 1828, when Constable was at Brighton early in the year.  Mr. J. W. Goodison has drawn attention to an oil-sketch painted by Constable on 20 July 1824 and now in the Fitzwilliam Museum, entitled \u201cShoreham Bay.  The walk to the Chalybeate Wells, Brighton\u201d.  This appears to show the same section of coast as No. 303 [155-1888], though from a different viewpoint, thus confirming the traditional identification.\"",
