It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years. Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nPercy Marmont was born in London and made his first stage appearance in 1900 at the New Theatre, Cambridge, in The Only Way.  He first appeared on the London stage at the Haymarket Theatre in 1902, as the servant in Many a Slip.  He spent many years touring in comedy and drama; visited South Africa in 1913 where he also appeared in his first film, Die Voortrekkers.  In 1916 he was engaged with the Liverpool Repertory Company.  He made his first appearances in New York at the Empire Theatre in 1917 as Dr Forsyth in The Three Bears and as de Varville in The Lady of the Camellias  He spent  the 1920s in America working on films and when the 'talkies' began he went back to England where he took part in many other films and stage productions. In 1936 he shot The Captain's Table., the only film he directed.",
