The ribbon was probably made in Coventry, the centre for woven commemorative ribbons, book marks and pictures throughout the second half of the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nItems commemorating royal events became particularly popular following the increase of interest in the British royal family from around 1850. This was due specifically to the high esteem of Queen Victoria. This ribbon depicts her grandson, George V and his wife Queen Mary (ne\u00e9 Princess Mary of Teck). The Royal standard and a depiction of Windsor Castle provides further evidence of the popularity of the royal family at this time.\n\nJohn Pollock, the donor's grandfather, was Director of the Fore Street Warehouse Company Limited. It is likely that this ribbon was owned by him and then handed down through the family.",
