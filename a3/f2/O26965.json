Some pieces might interlock, but most of the puzzle was just pushed into place. This meant that it would not stay in one piece very easily. To solve this, the outer edges of some puzzles, like this example, had long interlocking pieces that would hold the whole puzzle together.\n\nThe Great Exhibition of 1851 provided the inspiration for many games and puzzles. This one is unusual in that the picture on the puzzle is different to the one on its box. The subject matter is the same, but the publisher is different.",
