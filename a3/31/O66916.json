She was the mother of the Emperor Constantine who ended the persecution of Christians in the western lands of the Roman Empire in 313. St Helen is shown here carrying the cross upon which Christ was crucified and also a church.\n\nAccording to an early legend, St Helen received a vision revealing to her the spot where Christ was buried and where the True Cross was deposited. She ordered an excavation and built the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on the site.\n\nThis panel is part of a window that includes a panel of St Anthony of Padua (Museum no. C.57-1919). Much of the stained glass designed for religious settings was removed from its original location and dispersed. This was often the result of religious and political upheavals.",
