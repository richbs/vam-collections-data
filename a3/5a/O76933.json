It featured stylised plants and other ornament in relief against a hatched ground, originally filled with a black compound. The decoration was often arranged in bands or cartouches that matched the shape of the object. Poetic inscriptions in the elegant \u2018nasta\u2019liq\u2019 style of Persian calligraphy were also common. Human and animal motifs, absent since before 1400, reappeared.
