The scheme was conceived as a triptych with a predella below, in which this painting would have been the central image. It shows the wedding celebrations of Peleus, King of Thessaly. All the gods and goddesses had been invited except for Discord, the evil-looking figure to the viewer's right, who arrived unexpectedly. She gave to Mercury, shown half-kneeling from behind, an apple inscribed 'For the Fairest'. At the other end of the table are Venus, Minerva and Juno, all of whom think this prize is for them.\n\nThe composition was laid out to Burne-Jones's design by his assistants and subsequently over-painted by the master. Classical subjects like this gave Burne-Jones a chance to paint the nude and especially to show his fascination with Michelangelo. The central figure of Jove is effectively a quotation of the Christ from Michelangelo's Last Judgement in the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican.",

Mackail, 1920\n\nHistorical significance: Edward Burne-Jones was the leading figure in the second phase of the Pre-Raphaelite movement. His paintings of subjects from medieval legend and Classical mythology and his designs for stained glass, tapestry and many other media played an important part in the Aesthetic Movement and the history of international Symbolism \n\nIn the summer of 1870 Burne-Jones started to plan one of his most ambitious works, a complex triptych illustrating scenes from the story of Troy. The large work in Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, <i>The Story of Troy</i>, or <i>The Troy Triptych</i>, is probably an unfinished study for a larger work which was planned but never carried out. The central panel of the triptych represents the Judgement of Paris; the left-hand panel shows Helen carried off by Paris to Troy under the protection of Venus; and the right-hand panel shows the denouement of the story: Helen captive in burning Troy as the city is besieged and sacked by the Greeks. Beneath the triptych is a predella, the central part of which represents the feast of Peleus, at whose wedding to Thetis the story of Troy began. One each side of the central part of the predella are symbolic representations of Venus Concordia and Venus Discordia. Four intermediate panels eleborate on the theme of Amor Vincit Omnia: Fortune; Fame overthrowing Fortune; Oblivion conquering Fame; and Love subduing Oblivion. \n\nEach element of the <i>Troy Triptych</i> was taken further in a variety of ways. The subjects represented on the predella eventually gave rise to the most fully completed individual oil paintings: <i>The Feast of Peleus</i> (1872-81), <i>The Wheel of Fortune</i> (1875-83), and the pair of canvases <i>Venus Concordia</i> and <i>Venus Discordia</i> (taken up in the 1890s but left unfinished at Burne-Jones's death in 1898). \n\nThe principal version of <i>The Feast of Peleus</i> is also in Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery. At 36.9 x 109.9cm, it is very much smaller than the version in the V&A. Begun in 1872, the Birmingham painting was largely complete by 1873, although only finished in 1881 in preparation for inclusion in a Grosvenor Gallery exhibition the following year. \n\nThe V&A's version of the painting was begun in 1881 (possibly because Burne-Jones may initally have intended to display a version on a more impressive scale at the Grosvenor Gallery); however, it was not finished and remained incomplete at the artist's death.",
