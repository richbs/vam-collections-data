This band is bordered above and below by three stripes, two containing geometrical ornament and the third having a wavy band from which issue stems ending in animals' heads.  Lower down is another stripe, not continuous, with a row of wedge shaped devices.  A corresponding stripe above contains Coptic characters.  Along the bottom is embroidered a series of triangular forms, crosses and finials in wool and linen threads, the former chiefly black.  The ground of the hanging is red, with woven horizontal stripes of undyed wool disposed so as to form borderings to the ornamentation.\nThe stripes with the animals; heads are similar to those on  275-1889, 372-1895, 188-1891 and others in the collection.",
