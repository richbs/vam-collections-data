They came to be known as 'English chairs' in various European languages.  Certainly many such chairs were made in London between about 1670 and 1710 and some were exported, but little is known of other centres of production in Europe.  When it was acquired, this armchair was thought to be English but it is now thought that it may possibly have been made in a Netherlandish city. The large oval panel of caning in the back differs from the usual British pattern of two thin, vertical panels of caning.\n\nOn loan to Ham House.",
