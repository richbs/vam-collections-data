All the designs had to be\nsubmitted to a lengthy and complex refining process\nof presentation and exchange between designer and\nclient, who was represented by various committees\noperating under strict rules. Stamps, like the \ncoins of the realm, have to receive royal approval.\n Ashted Dastor Associates were initially invited to \nsubmit proposals for this project in 1991, and the\nminute attention to detail demanded both by \ndesigner and client is evident in the designs and \ndocumentation. Royal Mail described the reasons\nfor their choice of theme in these words:\n\"Britain's artists have made a unique contribution\nto the modern art movement, and their achievement\nis recognized in this set of stamps. It is Royal \nMail's contribution to 'Art in the Twentieth\nCentury', which has been adopted by Europe's postal\nadministrations as the theme to be celebrated in\n1993. The images presented here - from a sculptor,\na print maker, an iconographer and an abstract\npainter - are symbolic of the enormous and\nexceptionally varied talent that has been fostered\nin the past ten decades among the artists of the\nUnited Kingdom.\" The artists chosen (after long\ndebate) were Edward Bawden, Henry Moore, Ben \nNicholson and Stanley Spencer.\n\nManilla folder, with a label inscribed <u>Royal Mail\n92/93 A649 -FDC/Filler Card A650 - Hand Stamps,</u>\ncontaining colour transparencies and other \nphotographs of various objects intended to be used\na [sic] images illustrating the First Day Cover and the \nhandstamps [for cancelling], including a pot\ncontaining artists brushes, tools and materials,\nan open ring bound sketch book, the facade of the \nTate Gallery, a mock up of the card on a miniature\neasel, a three dimensional mock up of the word\n'ART' consisting of a block of stone incised 'A', a\ncalligraphic brush stroke 'R', and a printing block\nfor the letter 'T'. Alternative layouts for\npresentation to various committees for the top flap\nof the pack, the filler card and the first day\ncover; preliminary designs for the handstamps,\nincluding photocopies of photographs of Henry\nMoore, his house and studio at Perry Green,\nHertfordshire, and his sculptures; photographs, \ntracings and drawings of the interior of the Tate\ngallery showing Rodin's 'The Kiss'; proofs of the\nfiller card.\nPencil, pen and ink, ball point pen, felt tip pen,\ncolour pencil, photographs, photocopies, colour\nphotocopies, colour half-tone, collage and\nletterpress on various papers and films.\nSize of folder: 34.8 x 48 cm                    E.104-1996'",
