            "public_access_description": "The Commedia dell\u2019Arte, was a form of improvised street theatre, which spread from16th-century Italy throughout Europe, and remained popular for around two centuries. Commedia dell'Arte troupes engaged in very physical acting using music, dance and acrobatics in their performances. While the plot was largely improvised, stock characters were used and were recognisable to the audience by their costumes, accents and poses. The popularity of this theatre form inspired paintings and decorative objects depicting the commedia characters. \n\nFrom the late 1730s and into the 1740s the Meissen modeller Johann Joachim K\u00e4ndler produced a great variety of figures based on Commedia dell\u2019Arte characters. On stage Commedia dell\u2019Arte antics included bawdy humour which avoided censorship due to the improvised nature of the performances. This model of Harlequin waving a sausage at Columbine, while placing his hat on her lap, refers to his amorous intentions.  This group is first recorded in 1740 in K\u00e4ndler's list of new models.",
