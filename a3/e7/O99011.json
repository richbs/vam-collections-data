            "public_access_description": "The most important French porcelain factory was founded in about 1740 in the royal ch\u00e2teau of Vincennes, with workmen lured from the nearby factory at Chantilly. Commercial production began in earnest around 1745 when Louis XV granted it a privilege to make porcelain 'in the manner of Saxony, painted and gilded, with human figures'.\n\nAs the wording of the privilege suggests, the factory's earliest style was indebted to the prestigious hard-paste porcelain made at Meissen in Saxony. However, the support and protection of Louis XV and his mistress, Madame de Pompadour, enabled Vincennes to secure the best technicians, artists, sculptors and designers.  The factory's repertoire quickly evolved from the emulation of East Asian or Meissen examples to incorporate the latest styles used in French gilt-bronze, woodcarving and decorative painting. Vincennes became renowned for its luxurious ground colours and richly-tooled gilded decoration. By 1756 the factory had outgrown its workshops in the old ch\u00e2teau and it transferred to specially constructed premises at S\u00e8vres.\n\nThe Royal Manufactory specialised in exceptionally luxurious objects, many destined for the French court.  Tea, coffee and chocolate wares were among its most popular products. This exquisite tea-set or d\u00e9jeuner has the fashionable rose pink ground colour, rich gilding and swags of flowers.  It was no doubt for the personal use of a very wealthy courtier or member of the royal family and would probably have been used in the boudoir or bedroom.\n\nDuring the first half of the 18th century coffee was the most popular hot drink in France. However, by the middle of the century, the refined pastime of tea drinking had become fashionable among the wealthy elite.  Tea was an expensive luxury and it was served using appropriately precious vessels. Strong tea was poured from a comparatively small pot and diluted with hot water in the cup; sugar was added to alleviate the bitterness, and sometimes hot or cold milk.",

For a discussion of the rectangular tray shape,<i> plateau tiroir</i>, see no. 81, pp. 171-172; a white example with children in landscapes, also of the first size and marked E for 1757-1758. The shape owes its name to its resemblance to a drawer of a desk. 2020B-1855 is cited at note 11. They often, but not always, have feet, either round, cone- or baluster-shaped. Two 18th-century moulds for the shape survive at S\u00e8vres. They were first introduced in 1756, in two sizes (there were four biscuit examples waiting to be glazed in the inventory of January 1757, covering production of 1756). The first recorded sale was for an example decorated with flowers. It sold to the dealer Machard for 48 livres. Another version has pierced sides. The <i>plateau tiroir </i>was sold almost exclusively as part of a tea set. Its price varied enormously depending on the decoration: a set described as <i>rose mosa\u00efque,</i> including one of the first size, was sold to King Louis XV in December 1758 for 600 <i>livres</i>.\nSavill, Rosalind. <u>The Wallace Collection: Catalogue of S\u00e8vres Porcelain</u>, 3 vols. London: Trustees of the Wallace Collection, 1988. See Vol. II, p. 491 for notes on d\u00e9jeuners : 'Small tea services with a matching tray were called <i>d\u00e9jeuners</i>. Such sets were in production by 1753 when they were itemized in the documents. From 1756 the term <i>d\u00e9jeuner</i> was used, qualified by the title of the tray... Duvaux used the term <i>d\u00e9jeuner</i> for a set before it appeared at S\u00e8vres. The composition of a <i>d\u00e9jeuner</i> depended on the size of the tray.... Few <i>d\u00e9jeuners</i> of the 1750s included a teapot but theey were sometimes added later; in 1758 Duvaux sold '<i>Un d\u00e9jeuner gros-bleu &amp; l'augmentation d'une th\u00e9i\u00e8re en place d'une tasse</i>'. Most <i>d\u00e9jeuners</i> were independent items, but from the 1770s they were sometimes sold with dinner services.'",
