In addition to providing protection and warmth, the purpose of many gloves was solely decorative, to display the wealth and status of their owner. They were worn in the hat or belt, as well as carried in the hand. In combat, a glove was thrown down as a gage, or challenge.\n\nThe short cuff of this glove suggests that it dates from the late 17th century.  Remnants of black silk around the cuff indicate that it was probably once decorated with clusters of ribbon bows, a popular style of decoration during this period.",
