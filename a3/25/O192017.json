Ibrahim Bohme was elected cgairman and Willy Brandt, former West German Chancellor, was elected honorary chairman, a position he also held in the West  german SPD. Ibrahim Bohme had in his youth been a  member of the former communist SED party but had left it in 1976 in protest at the persecution of  intellectuals. Imprisoned for his views, he was also banned from teaching history and later became a founder member of the SPD. Allegations that he had once been associates with the State Security police caused him to resign the party leadership immediately after the  elections, even though he denied any links with the  Stasi and was subsequently \"exonorated\". Markus Meckel, his deputy took over the leadership on 1 April 1990.  For further information on the SPD see notes to E.2087-1990.",
