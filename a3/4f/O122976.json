Sent three works to the Society of Arts and won a gold medal for a study of a boy's head. Practised as a portrait painter from 1812. Moved to London 1814, and in 1817 married William Hookham Carpenter (1792-1866) bookseller, publisher, artist, and from 1845 Keeper of Prints and Drawings at the British Museum. She seems to have had some connection with Sir Thomas Lawrence; she finished one of his portraits after his death in 1830 ('Mrs Brandling', exhibited SBA 1832, 164), and at least one of her portraits has been attributed to him ('Major-General John Fremantle', exhibited 'The Portrait Surveyed', Agnew's 1980, 17). She exhibited 147 portraits at the RA between 1818 and 1866 (nine as Miss Geddes 1814-17),50 works at the BI 1819-53 (11 as Miss Geddes 1814-17) - mostly 'fancy' pictures, and 19 at the SBA 1831-6. Several of her works were engraved. Died London 13 November 1872. Her sister married William Collins RA, and two of her children, William and Henrietta Carpenter, were also painters. There may also be a family connection with Andrew Geddes ARA. Three of her portraits are in the NPG; two watercolours are in the V&A collections. Clayton believed her 'one of the most distinguished portrait painters in England', and her husband's obituarist wrote that she 'would certainly have been a Royal Academician but for her sex' (<i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> September 1866, p410). \n\nLIT: \t<i>Art Journal</i> 1873, p6 (obit); E C Clayton <i>English Female Artists</i> 2 vols, 1876, I, pp386-8; <i>List of Pictures and Drawings by Margaret Carpenter from the year 1812 to 1864 with the prices paid for them</i>, MS transcript made 1899 for NPG (referred to below as <i>List</i>); C Yeldham <i>Women Artists in Nineteenth-Century France and England</i> 1984, I, pp254-7; P Gerrish Nunn <i>Victorian Women Artists</i> 1987, p36 etc \n\n<b>Devotion</b> \nFA17 Neg 69489 \nCanvas, 76.2 x 63.5 cm (30 x 25 ins) \nSigned and dated 'Margaret Carpenter/1821' br \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nExhibited at the BI in 1822, the size given in the catalogue as '42 by 37 inches', and at the loan exhibition there in 1825 lent by the then owner John Wilton. The <i>List</i> records a Mr Wilton paying \u00a331 10s. in 1822 for 'Cheerfulness' (presumably the painting of that title exhibited at the BI in 1823, 186); in 1823 'Devotion' appears alongside the name of the Marquis of Stafford, but should presumably refer to the same immediately above in the list - Mr Wilton, who paid \u00a336 15s. \n\nThe figure, traditionally called St Francis, seems to be drawn from a model, who was identified in the <i>Art Journal</i> obituary as the miniature painter Anthony Stewart (1773-1846). It may be compared with the 1812 portrait of him by Andrew Geddes (SNPG), which was probably lot 54 in the W H Carpenter sale at Christie's 16 February 1867, and with his miniature self-portrait in the V&A (P2-1967). The composition may be based on an old master painting, perhaps in the Radnor collection where the artist made copies in early life. A replica or copy measuring 73.6 X 61 cm (29 X 24 ins) was lot 158 at Christie's 12 June 1959.\n \nPROV: Bought from the artist by Mr Wilton 1823; ?John Wilton sale, Phillips, 16 May 1835; given by John Sheepshanks 1857 \n\nEXH: \tBI 1822 (199), 1825 (29)\"",
