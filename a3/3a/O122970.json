Commedia dell'Arte, or 'artistic comedy' was the popular improvised type of comedy which flourished in Italy from the 16th to the 18th centuries and had an impact on theatre throughout Europe, especially France. Commedia plays were acted along pre-arranged scenarios but relied on the performers' ability for improvisation and ensured their popularity with a mixture of knockabout comedy, acrobatic leaping and romantic interest. \n\nJacques Callot lived in Rome from 1608, and then in Florence from about 1612 where he was appointed to the court of Grand Duke Cosimo II in 1614, for whom he made numerous prints intended as official depictions of the various public festivities staged by the Medici Court. Callot had ample opportunity to make sketches of the entertainers participating in these events which later became source material for the Balli series, which Callot etched some time after he returned to his native Nancy.  His most famous series of prints was entitled Balli di Sfessania, c.1622 showing dances known as the 'sfessania' which were characterised by violent contortions and gesticulations.",
