            "physical_description": "Silk embroidered with couched metal thread and silk thread in flat stitch, faced with woven silk and backed with resist-dyed and block printed plain weave cotton.  Pieced from a larger  embroidery because the design does not match across the seam.\nThe main panel [39.5 x 38.5 cm] has a beige ground pieced across the centre to form a vase- like motif with a foliated triangular base framed by a curving serrated leaf and subsidiary stems in black silk bearing exotic flowers, buds and leaves.  The main areas are worked with metal thread with silk details.\nSilk threads: light blue, two shades of light pink, yellow, green, black [outlines]; 2S.  The black outlines are worked in stem stitch.\nMetal thread: silver strip close S-wound on Z-twist white silk; silver-gilt strip close S-wound on S-twist yellow silk; repairs worked with a more modern metal thread which is silver strip open Z-wound on light blue silk, couched with blue silk - this is much thinner than the original metal threads.\nBorder: pieced, orange silk satin.  Some of the embroidery has been worked over some of the seams while other seams cut through the embroidered design, again suggesting it was made from a larger piece.\nThe seam joining the border to the central panel has been concealed by couched black silk.\nThe under-drawing can been seen in places.  There is a double meander with a black stem and split leaves and large and small 5 or 6-petalled flower heads plus other, non-repeated floral motifs. In the split leaves and some flowers the orange ground is yellow. We think this indicates that the orange was 'bleached' using a block or stencil to reproduce the design.\nMetal thread: silver strip open and closed S-wound  on Z-twist silk of various colours including coral, blue, white and light brown.  Were they using-up odds and ends for the silk core?\nSilk threads: very small amounts of pink and blue; 2S.\nFacing: narrow bias-cut woven satin striped ; white or blue ground decorated with a small floral motif in pink, light blue and light brown; separated by green and red lines.\nBacking: pieced, resist-dyed and block printed plain weave.  There are two fabrics: [1] green ground with offset rows of a repeated left-facing boteh composed of a flowering spray in white, purple, red, pink and yellow with dark and light green leaves. [2] a small piece of similar but more loosely woven cotton.  The floral spray is ovoid with a large round dark red blossom, smaller red buds, white flowers and small amounts of purple.",
