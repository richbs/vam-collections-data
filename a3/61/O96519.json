It was revived in Europe during the Renaissance, and again in the 18th and 19th centuries. Cameos and intaglios were prized and collected, sometimes as symbols of power and mounted in jewelled settings, sometimes as small objects for private devotion or enjoyment. The engraver has cut this bust entirely from the dark upper layer of the stone, using the contrast with the white lower layer to full effect. Matt and polished areas suggest the different textures of flesh, hair, fabric and jewellery. This cameo was probably formerly in the collection of the gem collector Thomas Howard, 2nd Earl of Arundel.",

Thought to be North Italian in origin and described by Kris as Italian, two of this group were catalogued as French for the exhibition 'Die Kunst des Steinschnitts' in Vienna in 2002/03. The cameo is, however, comparable in terms of the elaborate coiffure and treatment of ornament and opulent drapery, to the medals of Pastorini, Bombarda and Abondio - for example to the latter's portrait of Caterina Riva dated by Attwood to the 1570s. Appears as Tassie cast no.14732, 'Portrait of an unknown Lady (Stosch)'. The claim that the cameo once formed part of the Arundel collection and has descended from it via the collections of the Dukes of Marlborough was argued at the time of acquisition in 1978 by Charles Avery, and by Diana Scarisbrick in her catalogue entry for the exhibition 'Thomas Howard Earl of Arundel' at the Ashmolean Museum in 1985/6. The case is based on its similarity to descriptions of a gem which can be traced back to an MS catalogue of the Arundel gems and thence via two catalogues of the Marlborough gems. The Earl of Arundel bought a large collection of gems from Daniel Nys, the Venetian dealer who facilitated the sale by the Gonzaga to Charles I of the Mantegna Triumphs.",
