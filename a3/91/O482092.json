Below this is a bulbous section of pierced and engraved designs;  the cover has engraved and embossed designs of foliage and figures..  Similar designs cover the bowl itself, with the addition of Stratford, and with the figures in very high relief.\nThe stand has a flange which holds the foot of the  bowl;  below this is a pierced and engraved plate in the form of leaves.  There are then two pierced and engraved bulbous sections leading to another, unpierced, which then spreads out to form the base, embossed and engraved with flowers and figures, and with a pierced flower and strapwork border, the whole supported on three cast lions who rest on their forelegs and are attached to the stand by their hind legs.  Also attached to the stand are figures of cast silver in what appear to be dancers' costumes.  \nIt is likely that the scenes and figures illustrated a Jataka story - possibly the abduction at Sita from the Ramayana.",
