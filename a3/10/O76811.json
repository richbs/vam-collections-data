This gaunt mask of Ishiojo - or possibly Mai-Jo, who appears in Noh plays such as Saigyo-Zakura - is carved from a single piece of cypress. It was primed with a layer of sabi-urushi (a wood primer, or base coat, formed from wheat flour, fine clay and lacquer), with a thin layer of gesso (J. gofun) on top to act as the base medium for the paint. The aged Ishiojo's sorrowful features are well depicted in this skilfully carved mask. The deeply sunken eyes with their hooded lids give a haunted look.\n\nThe mask is painted a pale flesh colour, with details around the eyes, ears, cheekbones and forehead picked out in a dark pink. The square pupils of the eyes are highlighted by lines of ink over a white base paint. The eyebrows are picked out in lines of alternating grey and black ink, as is the moustache and hair on the chin. The lips are a deep red colour and are slightly open to reveal the upper and lower sets of teeth which are painted black with highlights in gold. The topknot and beard are of grey horsehair, which is held in sockets by means of small wooden pegs. Most of the hair is still present on the mask. The cord-holes show signs of wear and have become almost oval in shape. The back edges of the ears also show wear and have a groove where the cords have rubbed. \n\nThe interior of the mask has been lacquered a dark brownish-black through which the broad, confidently executed chisel marks are visible. The hollows for the eyes are small and the recess for the nose has many fine cat-scratch-like vertical lines.",
