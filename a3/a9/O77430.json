Fuseli was a particular admirer of Milton and painted some 60 pictures illustrating episodes from his works. In 1799 and 1800 Fuseli held two exhibitions in which he exhibited 47 of his paintings of Milton's works. He then planned to publish a series of 50 prints after his paintings. This 'Milton Gallery' was a project similar to John Boydell's 'Shakespeare Gallery', in which the exhibition of paintings would publicise the prints that were later sold. In the end, only 14 prints were published, between 1803 and 1814.\n\nSubject Depicted\nThis print illustrates an episode from Book V of Paradise Lost. It illustrates the moment when Eve recounts to Adam her dream of being carried aloft to the heavens by a winged figure:\n\n... Forthwith up to the clouds\nWith him I flew and underneath beheld\nThe earth outstretch'd immense ...\n... suddenly\nMy guide was gone, and I methought sunk down\n\nThis print shows Eve sinking back down to earth, as the winged figure leaves her.",
