I.' engraved on one side probably stand for the Latin words 'Oleum Infirmorum', or 'oil of the sick'. This oil is used by clerics to annoint the sick in order to heal them or, more commonly, is applied during the rituals prescribed for the dying by the Roman Catholic and Anglican churches.\nMuch seventeenth-century French silver was melted down in the eighteenth century to subsidise aggressive royal foreign policy, so this casket represents a small but significant survival. The plain, architectural shape of the container is typical of seventeenth-century Parisian workmanship: no details have been added to make the casket resemble a church or house in anything but form.\nThe maker, Henri Hersant, appears to have had a chequered career. In 1679 he was struck off the list of practising Parisian goldsmiths as part of the attempts of Paris authorities to curb the number of such workers in the city; in 1680 he resumed work under his own name, only to be listed as 'absent' in the 1682 records of Paris goldsmiths. In 1703 he appears in documents for the last time, as one who deals in precious stones or who has left the trade.",
