In this series of etchings he examines his personal response to the horrors of the Iran/Iraq war in 1986-1990, using poingmant visual metaphors and haunting symbols evoking the power and futility of this war. \n\nFrom 'Dark Interludes' by Walid Siti:-\n\n'This series originated in a cycle of drawings which I produced during the years from 1986 to 1990, the peak of the protracted Iran-Iraq war that culminated in the attack with chemical weapons on the Kurdish town of Halabja.\n\nAlthough this work was done partly in the light of those events and as a response to them, it is not a documentation. My interest lay in an attempt to work through my thought processes and ideas and in registering my sense of despair, hopelessness and complete bewilderment as an artist faced with events of such magnitude.'\n\nThis set is an important commentary on a war which affected the lives of many, espcially those politcal refugees from this region who now live in the U.K.\n\nThese etchings were hand-printed by the artist from copper plates on Somerset white soft paper.",
