'Each finished object', she said, 'is like a painting, an individual work, an original'. \n\nMeyerowitz was born in the UK and studied jewellery at the Central School of Arts and Crafts, London before moving to the United States in 1970. She describes in detail the tools and materials required for assembling small scale parts into finished objects, which can be worn. However, she questions the function of jewellery, and compares it with sculpture. She uses industrial waste and machine off-cuts achieving amazing results.\n\nThe necklace is published in Meyerowitz's book Jewellery and Sculpture through Unit Construction (1967), fig. 7.",
