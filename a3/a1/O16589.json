It is covered with a celadon glaze underneath which there is black and white inlaid decoration. The decoration features four roundels enclosing either a chrysanthemum or peony spray with willows between each roundel. There is a band of lotus petals around the shoulder and the foot, leafy sparys on the neck, and a squared spiral border around the mouth. There are touches of underglaze copper red on the peonies. Some areas on the neck and foot are unglazed, there is gold lacquer repair to the rim. The small loop has been restored and there is a firing crack on the base which extends to the body.\n(bib: \"Korean Art in the United Kingdom. Part 1: The collections at London and Oxford. Sir John Figgess. Korean Culture, vol.6, no. 2, p.10, plate 6.)\n\nThis bottle consists of a globular body and a long cylindrical neck. The upper and lower parts of the body are encircled by lotus petal bands. Between these there are four evenly spaced double-line medallions each framing a chrysanthemum or peony spray. Willow patterns figure between the medallions. The designs are all inlaid with black and white clay, while the white petals of the peonies are enhanced with touches of underglaze copper red. The grass and flower patterns with which the neck is adorned are executed in inlaid black and white clay. A deep greenish glaze is evenly applied to the bottle, and the short foot bears marks of sand spurs. It is likely that the bottle was made at a kiln in Yucheon-ri, Buan, in the late 13th century.",
