It was formerly identified as Portuguese, but Indo-Portuguese figures from Goa exhibit similar features, and the edging of the drapery, the cherubim, and the acanthus on the base imply a Goan origin for the present piece. \nIvory carving had a long tradition on the Indian subcontinent, and elaborate works of art were made, particularly as diplomatic gifts, often presented to Western rulers. From the sixteenth century onwards, the four main missionary Orders, the Augustinians, Jesuits, Dominicans and Franciscans, built churches and aimed to convert the inhabitants of India. The ivories would assist in the presentation of Christian imagery, as well as being exported back to churches, convents and private collectors in Europe.",
