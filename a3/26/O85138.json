The lamp  shown hanging in the mihrab associates the tile with a burial. In tombs, the presence of a mihrab indicated that the corpse was correctly aligned with the qiblah when it was buried. This means that the deceased will rise facing the qiblah when they are resurrected on the Day of Judgement. \n\nIt is thought that this tile and another, very similar piece in the V&A's collection (C.1977-1910) formed a pair that were placed at either end of a large, rectangular tomb marker in a grand tomb. Other tiles would have covered the top and sides of the marker. \n\nTiles of this type with lustre decoration were produced in Iran between 1200 and 1340 and were used to decorate palaces, mosques and shrines. They were produced by families whose work can be traced over several generations, and this example was made by a man called 'Ali ibn Ahmad ibn 'Ali ibn Abi'l-Hasan, who is known to have worked in the early 1300s.",
