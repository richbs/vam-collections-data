Folio numbers are written in the lower right-hand corner of the reverse of each folio but are defective from folio 85 onwards due to insect damage.

            "public_access_description": "The Kalpasutra (Book of Rituals) is the most important canonical text in Jain literature for the Svetambaras (white-clad), one of the two sects of Jainism.  Jainism is one of the oldest religions to have survived until the present time and its basic teaching is one of non-violence.  The Kalpasutra is divided into three sections.   The first section deals with the lives of the twenty-four Jinas or Tirthankaras, who were the Jain spiritual teachers or 'ford-makers'.  The second part deals with the life of Mahavira, the twenty-fourth Tirthankara.  The third part deals with rules for the ascetics and laws during the four months (chaturmas) of the rainy season, when ascetics temporarily abandon their wandering life and settle down amidst the laity. This is the time when the festival of Paryushan is celebrated and the Kalpasutra is traditionally recited.\n\nThe upper register of this folio shows the 23rd Jina, Parshvanatha, as a prince riding on an elephant and commanding his servant to save a snake (one of a pair) who were in a log and were about to be burned in the fire penance of the ascetic Kamatha, who was unaware they were there and objected to the interruption of his ritual. Below, Parshvanatha has now become an ascetic in the search for perfect knowledge but Kamatha, who had been angered by the episode and by Parshvanatha's superior knowledge, has been reborn as the demon Meghamalin and attempts to disrupt Parshvanatha\u2019s meditation by sending a terrible storm and flood. Parshvanatha stands in kayotsarga, the body-abandonment posture, in front of a rectangular pool of water and is sheltered from the assault by the snake, now reborn as the mighty snake-king Dharanendra, with his seven-headed cobra hood.",
