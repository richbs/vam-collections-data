            "public_access_description": "This miniature was painted in the last years of the so-called Interregnum, the years between the execution of King Charles I in 1649 and the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660. After the Restoration Richard Gibson became Samuel Cooper's leading competitor in London. But during the Interregnum, Gibson's working life could not have been more different. Unlike Cooper, Gibson did not train within the highly competitive professional London art world. His early monogram, \u2018DG\u2019, standing for the diminutive \u2018Dick\u2019 or even \u2018Dwarf\u2019, reflects his very different introduction to miniature painting. Gibson was only three feet ten inches tall (about 1.2 metres) and was employed as a \u2018page\u2019, a position more usually taken by young boys. He learned drawing and miniature painting with encouragement of his employers, especially Philip Herbert, Earl of Pembroke, Lord Chamberlain to Charles I. Pembroke died in 1649, the same year as the King, leaving Gibson an annuity. Gibson was able to spend the uncertain years of the Interregnum at Ascot, under the protection of Pembroke's grandson. When the family returned to power and influence with the Restoration, Gibson moved to London, setting up professionally, and signing himself confidently \u2018RG\u2019. His painting technique reflects his unusual training, as can be seen in this miniature. Gibson painted miniatures using a thick, rough impasto (paste-like pigment), an oil painting technique that he undoubtedly copied from his friend Peter Lely, a portrait painter in oils.",

FHA Wallop; lent to the V&A 1927-49; given to Alan Evans 1933, and by him bequeathed to the National Gallery, 1947; placed on indeterminate loan at the V&A. (See Appendix 3.) \n\n<b>Literature:</b> <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 24 (as by Gibson). \n\nThe miniature was attributed by Wallop, possibly with Long's tacit acquiescence, to Hoskins and dated c.1645-50. Reynolds, reviewing the Wallop/Evans Loan for its return in 1949, commented: 'In my opinion this may be attributed plausibly to D Gibson'. (1) This is surely right, for although the diagonal striation across the features, which is characteristic of Gibson's early work, is not present, the heavy 'Wiped' impasto is distinctive, and the overall appearance of the miniature, with the figure brightly lit from the front against a dull background, is characteristic. The date should be in the 1650s, when small formats tended to be favoured, or possibly as late as the early 1660s, when Gibson's palette brightened and the striation became much less evident. \n\nThe identification of the sitter appears to be traditional and is the more plausible for being inconclusive. Mrs Russell could conceivably have been the wife of the Baptist controversialist William Russel, resident c.1662 in Buckinghamshire, who died at an advanced age in 1702. This William Russel practised after c.1680 as a physician. He married early; one child born in 1663 reached maturity. Or the sitter could just about have been the wife ofWilliam Russell (1634-1696), chemist in ordinary to Charles II and the author of a <i>Physical Treatise</i> of 1684. There are several Reymes families at about the right social stratum: that of Barnes Reymes of Trinity Hall, Cambridge, MA in 1646; of William Reymes of Caius, son of John Reymes, gentleman of Overstrand, Norfolk; or of Bullen Reymes of Waddon Dorset, who entered Merton College, Oxford, in 1666, the son of Colonel Bullen Reymes MP. Elisabeth could have been related to one of these. \n\n1 MS note in Wallop Loan Book.\u201d ",
