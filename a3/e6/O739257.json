            "public_access_description": "The building history of Peper Harrow House is complex and confused. It is possible that Chambers was first employed in 1760 or 1761 for altering and refurbishing the existing house. He may also have prepared plans for the complete rebuilding of the house. Certainly he made plans for offices or stables in 1762, which were built in the following year, as were two garden buildings.\n\nChambers was born in Sweden and died in London. He travelled widely, visiting China, and studied architecture at the Ecole des Arts, Paris, from 1749 and in Italy from 1750 to 1755.  Many of his drawings from this period are contained in his important 'Franco-Italian' album, held in the V&A.  Chambers moved to London in 1755 and published his influential Treatise on Civil Architecture in 1759.  Chambers demonstrated the breadth of his style in buildings such as Gower (later Carrington) House and Melbourne House, London, in such country houses as Duddingston, Scotland, and in the garden architecture he designed for Wilton House, Wiltshire, and at Kew Gardens. He became head of government building in 1782, and in this capacity built Somerset House, London.",
