Extract from a letter from Lady Burne-Jones to Mr. Emery Walker, in reference to Philip Webb's plans for Red House, Upton, the home of William Morris:-\nOctober 12, 1915\nI am sending by Passenger train (tomorrow) the Plans for Red House (not <i>the</i> Red House as people will call it!) and for the additions to it which were dreamed of. There are seven sheets for each.\nYoue will see that Nos. V and VI for details of Red House are drawn on the two sides of the sheet, which is a pity.\nThere is a small sheet belonging to the imaginary House, and I think it is a suggestion of a fresh treatment for the proposed additional House, not further developed.\nThe sheet which divides Red House Plans from those of our Castle in the air has  - as you will perceive - a rough jotting upon it of the way Red House stood and the front garden.\nIn one of the Red House plans you will see written the names of flowers that are to be put in beds at the foot of the East wall and to climb up it. I do not know which of the friends wrote these, but remember how successful the laying out of the garden was, and that the house has never looked <i>'bare'</i>.",
