The earring has a flat crescent at the base, with a simple engraved pattern, with a thick wire extending from each end.  At one end the wire is coiled twice to make a loop, and at the other it arches across the top of the crescent to end in a hook which fits inside the loop.  There are six loops attached to the lower edge of the crescent, each of which holds a short length of loop-in-loop chain.  The first three chains end in a bell, and the second three end in a flat lozenge of sheet silver.",

Although individual pieces rarely date back any earlier than the 19th century, the designs are very old, and European observers liked to find traces of Roman or Phoenician influence.\n\nThe size and hook fastening of this example are typical of Berber earrings from this region.  The silver marks show that it was made in Egypt.  Egypt was a major centre for silver jewellery for the nomadic people of the Western Sahara and the deserts between Egypt and Syria.  \n\nThis earring was described as having the name halak when it was acquired, which is a generic Arabic name for earrings.",
