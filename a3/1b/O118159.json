It is not known when these two mounts (of six) were detached from the back of the cabinet - although they had disappeared before it entered the Berlin Royal Kunstkammer in 1835 - but the V&A acquired them in 1863 from the then Director of the Museum, Henry Cole. The cabinet entered the Kunstgewerbemuseum in Berlin in 1868 when it absorbed the contents of the Kunstkammer (inv. no. K2850) but was destroyed during the Second World War.",

These two mounts show figures of the god Mercury and Urania (the personification of Astronomy). A photograph taken of the original cabinet before it was destroyed shows that the oval section of each mount would have been backed by a sheet of lapis lazuli (see Pechstein, 1971). The degree to which Jamnitzer's workshop was mechanised can be seen in the use of die-stamping to produce the decorative borders. In the 1985 exhibition catalogue on Wenzel Jamnitzer (see References), the author sees the artistic influence of Wenzel's son, Hans (1539-1603) in the design of these mounts.",
