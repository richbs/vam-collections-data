Pyne here increases our sense of vast scale not by physically expanding his canvas but by his compositional structure.  The extent of the view seems limitless, into the distance as well as to both left and right, which well suits the subject: Cumberland is the north-westernmost county in England, adjoining the Scottish border, and renowned for its spectacular scenery, in the form of the Lakes and the Cumbrian  Mountains.  Pyne was a keen traveller, at home and abroad, and published two volumes of views in the Lake District in the 1850s. The rarified atmosphere, the silvery light filtering through the mists, appealed as much to Romantic sensibilities in the nineteenth century as it had to the seekers after the 'Picturesque' in the previous century.  Pyne indicates the area's attraction for artists, amateur as well as professional, by including the family in the ferns on the right, the woman with her paintbox and drawing board contemplating the magnificent view.",

Articled to a legal attorney; taught himself painting. Exhibited seven works at the RA between 1836 and 1855, 28 at the BI 1828-63, and 194 at the SBA 1833-70 (elected Member 1842, and later Vice-President). Subjects principally landscapes, mainly river and lake scenes; his style was much influenced by J M W Turner. Travelled in Switzerland and Italy 1846, and Germany and Italy 1851. Published 'Windsor, With Its Surrounding Scenery' nd [1838-40], 'The English Lake District' (Manchester 1853), and 'The Lake Scenery of England' (1859). There are also several drawings and watercolours in the V&A collections. Died 29 July 1870; his studio sale was at Christie's 25 February 1871. \n\nLIT: MS <u>Picture Memoranda</u> 1840-1868 National Art Library collection, V&A; <u>Art Journal</u> 1856, pp205-8; 1870, p276 (obit); <u>Athenaeum</u> 13 August 1870, pp217-8 (obit); \n\n<b>Thirlmere, Cumberland </b>\n1020-1886 Neg 58952 \nCanvas, 85.7 X 131.5 cm (33\u00be X 51\u00be ins) \nSigned and dated 'JBPYNE 1867 No 335' br \nDixon Bequest 1886 \n\nThe number inscribed on the work refers to the artist's manuscript <u>Memoranda</u>; the artist also notes that the work was originally painted for the dealer William Agnew in December 1850, but he 'Took up this subj[ec]t again in July 1867, extensively repainted on it and dated it 1867. for Mr Hooper'. This is presumably the dealer F W Hooper, but the work does not appear in the catalogues of his sales at Christie's 21 February 1880 and 10 March 1881. A label on the stretcher is inscribed (probably not in the artist's hand) 'Lake Scene Thirlmere/Cumberland/J B Pyne/G[uinea]s 300'. \nThe work may be compared with early extensive landscapes by J M W Turner such as 'Lowther Castle, Westmorland' (exh 1810, now private collection). There are drawings and watercolours of Thirlmere also in the V&A collections by William Green, John Downman, Henry Cole, and John Constable (see particularly the 1806 'Leathes Water' (Thirlmere) \n(G Reynolds <u>Catalogue of the Constable Collection </u>1973, cat 94, repr). \n\n\nRonald Parkison\"",

Pyne here increases our sense of vast scale not by physically expanding his canvas but by his compositional structure.  The extent of the view seems limitless, into the distance as well as to both left and right, which well suits the subject: Cumberland is the north-westernmost county in England, adjoining the Scottish border, and renowned for its spectacular scenery, in the form of the Lakes and the Cumbrian  Mountains.  Pyne was a keen traveller, at home and abroad, and published two volumes of views in the Lake District in the 1850s. The rarified atmosphere, the silvery light filtering through the mists, appealed as much to Romantic sensibilities in the nineteenth century as it had to the seekers after the 'Picturesque' in the previous century.  Pyne indicates the area's attraction for artists, amateur as well as professional, by including the family in the ferns on the right, the woman with her paintbox and drawing board contemplating the magnificent view.",
