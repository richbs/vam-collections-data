            "public_access_description": "This object was purchased by the India Museum at the Paris Exhibition of 1867 and transferred to the South Kensington Museum (now the V&A) in 1879. Hamilton & Co., which manufactured it in Calcutta, was founded in Edinburgh in 1808 and traded continuously until 30 June 1970. The huqqa, or \u2018hubble bubble\u2019 (smoking pipe), is a fine example of bidri ware, which is made by casting zinc alloyed with small amounts of lead, copper or tin. This forms a base for designs inlaid in silver. The name relates to Bidar, the city in central India most widely associated with the technique, which is unique to India. \n\nThe base and stand of this example are inlaid with a silver flower motif and silver mounts. The stem screws into the top of the base and is a hybrid of Indian and high Victorian taste, with naturalistic lotus flowers twining round the central stem. The tobacco bowl and cover are made of separately cast pieces decorated with a lotus pattern in low relief.",

Stem, 'chilim', 'sarpush' and applied decoration to the stand: silver.\n85cm high/ 50cm max. diameter\n\nThe firm of Hamilton and Company was working in Calcutta 1815 to 1970, though little is known about their products and scale of manufacture. The firm's mark is accompanied by a pseudo-assay mark of an elephant to imitate the British assay marks, and another mark ('P' in Bengali script) which may be that of a native workman. The pseudo-assay mark was not intended to mean that the purity of the silver met the standards of English assay offices but rather to suggest quality. The mark appears to belong to the 1860s, which would agree with the old India Museum records which state that this was acquired from the Paris Exhibition of 1867. The catalogue of Indian objects sent to this exhibition is too vague and incomplete to identify individual pieces. Something as flamboyant as this would almost certainly have been made as a showpiece for the exhibition. It is not clear where the 'bidri' base and stand were manufactured, the pattern of the inlay not being consistent with known Purnea or Murshidabad pieces, but Purnea did have an export trade in 'bidri'. However, the shape of the base is unusual and it may hve been commissioned by Hamilton's.\nSee Wilkinson [1973], pp.53-71.",
