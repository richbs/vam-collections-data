Museum staff bought it directly from the Exhibition because they believed that it would offer British furniture makers a fine example of what could be achieved in marquetry (inlaid work). At that time, most decoration was in historic styles. This panel was praised as showing 'arabesque decoration in the style of the cinque-cento period', that is, based on Italian designs of the 16th century, a period that was particularly admired. The panel cost \u00a310. Although the Museum recorded that it had been made in Rome, the records do not show the name of the maker.",
