Other details include a beaded sacred cord tied in a bow near the left breast, a band round the lower chest, keyura armlets, elbow bracelets, bangles, makara-kundala ear pendants, padasaras on the feet, and an armlet on the right foot only. On the head is the conical kirita-mukuta, characteristic of the God. The four arms display the following symbols: The upper right hand holds the wheel (cakra) poised on the tips of the first two fingers; the upper left hand holds the conch (sankha) similarly poised; the lower right is in abhaya mudra; the lower left, resting on the mace (gada). A srivatsa symbol, now abraded, is visible above the right breast.\nThe figure stands on a circular lotus pedestal, cast in one piece with a rectangular base, the latter with upright tenons for the support of an arched-surround or torana ( now missing) and projecting rings for rods. The tenons are supported by small rampant lions.\nThe figure and more particularly the base are heavily patinated.",

            "public_access_description": "A four-armed standing figure of the god Vishnu in the upright or samabhanga pose. The god stands erect and symmetrical, embodying in his person his cosmic role as the restorer of order and preserver of the universe. His four-armed form allows the display of his principal attributes: the upper right hand holds the flaming wheel (cakra) poised on the tips of the first two fingers; the upper left hand holds the flaming conch (sankha) similarly poised; the lower left, resting on the mace (gada). These are weapons of war \u2013 the cakra is a throwing discus, and the conch shell is used as a trumpet of battle, as witnessed in the battle scenes described in the epic Mahabharata. Visnu\u2019s fourth hand, the lower right, is in abhaya-mudra, gesturing protection. These all serve to evoke Visnu\u2019s role as guardian of the universe. The srivatsa, a triangular mark (now much abraded) is visible above the right breast, symbolising the source of the natural world as embodied in Visnu. This mark is also said to invoke Visnu\u2019s consort Laksmi. \n\nThe figure is richly dressed in patterned cloth and jewellery. He wears a tapering conical crown (kirita-mukuta), characteristic of Visnu and particularly elaborate ear pendants (kundala) in the form of rearing makara. The waist-cloth is worn with girdle and sash, the former with long beaded ties extending between the legs, and the latter with projecting bows at the hips. A sacred cord, of beaded design suggestive of pearls, is tied in a bow on the chest. He is adorned with elaborate jewellery, most notably a large torque, armlets (keyura) and a pearl belt with kirttimukha-face buckle.\n\nThe figure stands on a circular lotus pedestal, cast in one piece with a rectangular base, the latter with upright tenons for the support of an arched-surround (prabha, now missing) and projecting rings for securing with cord during processional use. The tenons are supported by small rampant lions. \n\nThe patination of the bronze confirms that this is an excavated icon. It formed part of a cache of bronze images discovered at Coimbatore and presented to Lord Curzon of Kedleston during his term as Viceroy of India, between 1898 and 1905.",
