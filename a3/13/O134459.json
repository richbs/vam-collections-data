This design by Gabriel Cyril Bunney is for a decorated charger that is an example of hand-coloured, non-commercial ware of the early twentieth century.  It is an example of the continuation into the 1900s of work influenced by the Arts and Crafts movement.  The charger itself is in the Ceramics and Glass Department. \n\nThe design reflects the work of an exciting and vibrant artistic community that included Louise Powell, who painted ceramics made by Wedgwood. Bunney's father was the painter J. W. Bunney, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Ruskin's and both parents were within the outer circle of the Ruskin/Pre-Raphaelite group - Gabriel Bunney (1876-1952) was called after Dante Gabriel Rossetti and also a son of Holman Hunt.\n\nG. C. Bunney was both a designer and teacher, and assistant to the architect W. H. Lethaby, at Camberwell, whose ideas were most influential on the late Arts and Crafts.  In addition, Bunney taught at the South Kensington Schools and later at Birmingham Central School.",
