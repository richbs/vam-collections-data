The print is in reverse of the painted panel and it is possible that both have a common source in some other print or painting. The table is signed \"Lucy Ussher fecit,\" and bears the coat of arms and crest of a branch of an Irish family of that name. Lucy Arabella was a daughter of John Ussher, of Landscape, Co.
