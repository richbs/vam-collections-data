The design is a stylised landscape. In the foreground a scroll, proclaiming 'TIME AND TIDE WAITS FOR NO MAN', spans three cyprus trees.  The trees stand in a meadow strewn with flowers that include bluebells, cyclamen and violets.   In the mid-ground,  two boats sail on a  lake/river against a background of hills and a sunrise or sunset.  High in the sky, above the clockface, blue birds fly. \n\nThe dial has a diameter of 4 1/2\" (11.4cm) and is painted onto the front wooden panel of the case.   In lieu of numerals,  letters spell out  'Tempus Fugit' (Time Flies), with the 'T' of \"Tempus\" placed at the 7 o'clock position and the 'F' of \"Fugit\" placed at the one o'clock position.  A cross is placed at the six o'clock position.  Dots act as minute marks. The hands are steel.  The hour hand terminates in a heart shape whilst the second hand is plain.\n\nThe top is completed by a gilt ogee cap which terninates in a spiked finial.\n\nThe door at the rear of the case, which gives access to the movement, has a knob in the shape of a stylised flower.  This twists in order to raise the latch which then releases the door.\n[Pendulum] The brass pendulum is suspended from a brass and steel movement.\nThe movement is composed of rectangular plates 5 \u00bc  \" x 4  1/8\" (133 x 104 mm).  It is an 8-day timepiece movement with fusee and chain and anchor escapement.  \n27T escape wheel, pallets embrace seven teeth.",

Also, a near-identical clock can be seen in photographs of Voysey's own dining room, from about 1900.  However, there is another similar clock in the Museum of Fine Art, Richmond, Virginia.

It is decorated with the childlike, flat patterns that its designer, C.F.A. Voysey (1857-1941), used for his textiles and wallpapers. There is another example of the same clock in the Museum of Fine Arts, Richmond, Virginia, USA.\n\nPeople\nC.F.A. Voysey, an architect and designer, was fascinated by clocks and designed many different types, ranging from domestic clocks, like this one, to large examples intended for offices and public buildings. He owned a clock like this which was photographed in his home, The Orchard, Chorley Wood, Hertfordshire, in 1901. An almost identical clock belonged to Mary, Countess of Lovelace (1848-1941), an Arts and Crafts enthusiast. She and her husband commissioned designs from Voysey for a new house at Ockham Park, Surrey, in 1894.\n\nTime\nVoysey's original design for this clock, dated 1895, shows conventional roman numerals on the face. In 1896 he exhibited a clock with that type of face at the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society in London. By 1901 he had exchanged the numerals for the Latin phrase tempus fugit ('time flies'), a characteristically neat reminder of the clock's function.",

Voysey owned a clock of the same design which was in the hall at his own house, The Orchard, Chorleywood, Herts, in 1901.\n\nJohn Jesse purchased this clock without a provenance at Portobello Market in 1970.  He then placed the object on loan to the Museum in December 1970.\n[Clock] Historical significance: The bird motif used in the decoration of this clock appears in other examples of Voysey's work e.g. in a wallpaper, called 'Fairyland', designed for Essex & Company.\n[Pendulum] When the clock arrived in the Museum in 1974, the pendulum remained in the care of the owner, John Jesse.  Upon the V&A's acquisition of the clock, the pendulum arrived in the Museum on 30/09/1998.",

A photograph of a display at the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society exhibition in 1896 (illustrated <u>C.F.A. Voysey</u> by Wendy Hitchmough, Phaidon Press 1997, page 59) shows the clock with the numerals replaced by the letters TEMPUS FUGIT. Voysey owned a clock with this new face, shown in a photograph dated 1901 of the hall at his home, The Orchard.\n\nThere are other examples of the Tempus Fugit clock. One is inscribed with the name of Mary, Countess Lovelace, an early and faithful patron of Voysey for whom he designed furniture. John Jesse also owned this clock and it is now in the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, Richmond, Virginia, USA. Another example of the Tempus Fugit clock is in a private collection in London.\n\nA clock, of the same form with the Tempus Fugit face, stamped with the registration mark No.308824 for 1897, but undecorated and made of ebony, was sold by John Jesse in 2005.  The design of the case proved popular and versions with Roman numerals include a plain white one (private collection, London) and one decorated by Robert Anning Bell (Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool) as well as an aluminium version made by W H Tingey (one of these was exhibited at the Arts & Crafts exhibition of 1903, No.394c, and was illustrated in House & Garden, III, 1903, p.211).\n[Clock] The form of the case, in particular the ogee cap, follows the design for the entrance gate with clocktower for Perrycroft near Malvern of 1893 or the entrance gate to the stables for the Sturgis House near Guildford.",
