It was a three-hour tragi-comedy, performed entirely in mime by five characters. Billed as: 'a musical play without words' it starred Jane May as Pierrot in typical white-face make-up and white ruff collar, a black suit and skull cap, playing the prodigal son of the title who falls in love with Phyrnette, his mother's washerwoman.
