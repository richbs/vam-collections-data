His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nMessel designed costumes and sets for Joseph L. Mankiewicz\u2019s film adaptation of Tennessee Williams's play Suddenly Last Summer (1959).  The disturbing story about the mystery surrounding the death of Sebastian, the poet son of the rich, eccentric Mrs. Venable, gave Messel the opportunity to create a fantastic, exotic garden which contributed to the dark atmosphere of the film.  It starred Elizabeth Taylor, Katharine Hepburn and Montgomery Clift, and was nominated for several Oscars, including two Oscars for Messel\u2019s set designs.\n\nA set design for the corridors in the Lion\u2019s View asylum, where Catherine is incarcerated.  She is seen escaping down a somber, oppressive corridor, which is shown in steep recession, heightening the drama of her flight.",
