The sequence started with Philippe le Hardi, or Philip the Bold (ruled 1364\u20131404). The Habsburgs were also shown in the case of Maximilian, Holy Roman Emperor from 1493, who married into the Burgundian line. The figures were all identified by coats of arms displayed below them.\n\nThe stained glass was removed in 1795 and shortly afterwards sold to a British dealer. Some of it was later installed at Kilburn Grange, a private house in north-west London. This was demolished in 1910. The Museum acquired the present panels (inv. nos C.438 to 439, 441 to 443-1918) in 1918, together with other coats of arms and a late figure of Charles V.\n\nThe ducal figures in stained glass now in the Chapel of the Holy Blood were made in the years 1845-7. They were based on watercolours of the originals.",

The glass from the Chapel was sold by the municipality of Bruges to a local man for a miniscule sum who then sold them, at great profit, to an English man in the early 19th century. Believe the glass ended up with firm of Watson & Bethell.\n\nThere are coloured drawings of the windows, pre-dispersal, in the Chapel archives. In 1845 reproductions of the panels were made from these drawings by the glass painter Pluys.\n\nIn 1913 they were owned by Grosvenor Thomas. He acquired them from Kilburn Grange which was erected after 1830. \n\nRackham, in a letter of 1921, says panels were previously in Kilburn Grange which had been pulled down 10 or 12 years ago [presumably meaning 1909 or 1911].

She got her title of 'Countess of Charolais' from Charles, the Count.\nShe was the daughter of Charles I of Bourbon and Agnes of Burgundy.\nThe arms displayed in the panel are a mirror image. The arms of Bourbon appear on the left impaling those of Burgundy with an escutcheon of pretence for Flanders, the arms of the Dukes of Burgundy and thus of her husband, Charles the Bold. All of the arms are completely reversed.\n\nIn the Magie du Verre exhibition catalogue (cat.9) there is a fragmentary stained glass panel of the Deposition with these arms displayed at the base. In this instance the arms of Isabella and her husband Duke Charles are displayed correctly BUT Isabel's are prominent (displayed on the right side of the shield, or left as you face it). I think this is a strong indication that the wife's arms are intended to be prominent and that the Holy Blood arms should be examined in this light.",
