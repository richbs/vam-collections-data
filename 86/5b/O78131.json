            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nMezzotint is a form of tonal engraving.  The engraver first creates a surface that will print solid black by roughening the surface of a copper plate with a serrated tool called a 'rocker'.  This process raises a fragile burr of displaced copper which will hold a lot of printing ink. The design is then created by smoothing this burr in varying degrees to print a range of velvety tones. For white highlights, the engraver polishes the burr completely away, making the plate perfectly smooth once more, so no ink will adhere after the surface has been wiped.\n\nDesign & Designing\nRobert Robinson did not invent this composition. He copied it from a Flemish engraving by Cornelis Bloemaert (1603-1684) of a fresco by Pietro da Cortona in the Pitti Palace in Florence, painted in 1642-1644. Robinson changed the semi-circle of the engraving, which follows the lunette shape of the painting, into a rectangle.\n\nPeople\nJohn Smith (1652-1743), another printmaker who specialised in mezzotints, acquired the printing plate for this mezzotint after Robert Robinson died. John Smith added to the plate his name and the letters 'ex', an abbreviation for excudit, Latin for 'published by'. Publishers ensured that their name appeared on prints so a collector who admired a particular print would know where  to buy it.",
