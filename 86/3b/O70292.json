He holds a closed book in his right hand and his emblem, a double-edged sword, upright in his left. He wears a gown and a cloak draped from his shoulders.\n\nThe left-hand corners of the panel are chipped. The front of the three-sided base of the panel has been scratched with the letters 'P I E R I  RO.' Slight traces of green paint remain on the ground at the bottom of the panel. Much gilding remains on the background, with traces of gesso knobs. There is gilding on the saint's beard and hair and on the edges of his robes. The blade of his sword is painted dark brown. His book is coloured green (now darkened) overpainted with a red pattern.\n\nThe back of the panel bears two lead-filled plugs, one with the remains of some latten strips. Almost the whole of the length of the centre of the panel has been scooped away and especially the bottom.",
