With the publication of W.L. Little's Staffordshire Blue in 1969, however, the craze for collecting, and for naming and analysing patterns, really began. It is extremely unlikely that the engravers of this Buffalo Pattern would have known that the painted Chinese version was supposed to be a depiction of the philosopher Lao-Tzu, the founder of Taoism who lived in the 6th century BC, and quite certain that the users of such printed tableware regarded it simply as exotic decoration.",
