            "public_access_description": "Matthew Bourne's ballet Highland Fling takes as its starting point the 19th century classic La Sylphide, in which a sylph falls in love with a young man on the eve of his wedding. He leaves his fianc\u00e9 to follow her, but in his desire to possess, he ultimately destroys her.  Bourne translated the action from picturesque Scottish glens and mountains to a squalid Glasgow tenement, while the characters became contemporary recognisable, if exaggerated, youngsters, and the sylph a drug-crazed vampire.  This costume was designed for one of the guests at the hero's stag night when he meets the crazed, doped up sylph in a lavatory.  The excess of tartan in set and costumes induced an almost hallucinatory sensation.  \nThe realism of the ballet demanded not ballet costumes, but contemporary clothes.   Brotherston gave this creation an  exaggeration which conveys the idea of Scottish lads' sharp dressing, teaming tartan Teddy-boy suit with the bright colours of shirt and brothel creeper shoes.  It is Scottishness taken to the extreme - and beyond.  \nBrotherston has evolved a personal style of costume design presentation.  Mostly he works around and within frames, sometimes adding graphics, and with schematic figures.  This means that the focus is on the costume itself, and the viewer is not constantly distracted by the inessentials.",

The production, a witty re-working of the great Romantic ballet \"La Sylphide\" with music by Herman Lovenskjold, was later presented at the Lillian Baylis Theatre, London, May 10th 1994, and then toured the country extensively.  The production was lit by Tina MacHugh, and the original cast included Maxine Fone as The Sylph, Scott Ambler as James, Etta Murfitt as Madge, Emily Piercey as Effie, and Simon Murphy as Gurn.",
