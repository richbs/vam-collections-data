She is the terrifying aspect of the female element and is independently represented as an aspect of the supreme female deity, Durga, and as one of the seven mothers (matrikas) where she is seen as the consort of Siva in his wild ascetic form of Bhairava. Camunda is represented as an emaciated old woman, her skeletal figure adorned with garlands of skulls and snakes, laughing hideously. In this terracotta Chamunda has a terrifying countenance, capturing remarkably the savage mood of her dark character. Camunda became an important figure in the sakta cults in which female aspects of deities became the focus of worship in their own right. The worship of Camunda appears to have become prominant by the late Gupta and early medieval period and it is to this period that this terracotta may be attributed.",

The worship of Camunda appears to have become prominent by the late Gupta period and it is to this era that this terracotta may be attributed. Terracotta was a favoured material for temple relief decoration, usually placed on the external walls of the sanctuary. Camunda had a secure place alongside Durga, of whom she is a manifestation, as seen in the rock-cut terraces at the 8th century Kailasa temple at Ellora.",
