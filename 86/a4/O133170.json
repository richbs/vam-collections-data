            "public_access_description": "Designer Oliver Messel collected a range of historical costumes and national dress, partly out of interest in the subject, partly to wear.  Fancy dress and masked balls had, for centuries, been a feature of social life, but by the end of the 19th century they were an opportunity for ostentatious display by the highest in society, who vied with each other to wear more and more lavish or imaginative costumes.  \n\nAlthough it might date from an earlier period, it is known that this costume was worn by the Prince of Bohemia in the 1880s and his grandson, Prince Lopkowitz gave it to Messel in the mid-1920s.  The 19th century developed a new sense of historical realism, and this spilled over into the fancy dress balls, although inevitably the costumes were 'historical' seen from a 19th century perspective.  The jacket is cut in the pigeon-chested shape of the Elizabethan doublet and some padding must have been worn beneath.  \n\nOliver Messel (1904-1978) was Britain's leading theatre designer from the early 1930s to the mid 1950s, working in every aspect of entertainment - ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue - as well as in interior decoration and textile design.  His lavish, painterly and romantic designs informed by period styles, were perfectly in tune with his times and earned him an international reputation.  By 1960, however, Messel's style had become unfashionable, having no sympathy with the new 'kitchen sink' school of theatre.  He increasingly concentrated on his non-theatrical painting and designing and eventually retired to the Caribbean, where he began a new career designing and building highly idiosyncratic luxury villas.",

There is no indication that Messel ever wore it himself.  \nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's theatre designs and other designs and artefacts.  The designs were briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being housed at the V&A from 1981 on indefinite loan.  The V&A Theatre Museum purchased the Oliver Messel collection from Lord Snowdon in 2005.",
