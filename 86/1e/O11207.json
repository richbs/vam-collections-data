The original design (shown alongside) shows that it took eighty-nine days to make the table, and cost \u00a322 - 5s - 5d for the joiner and \u00a321 for the carving.  Lock worked on it for fifteen days, the remainder being done by his assistants.  The design for the mirror shows that it took one hundred and thirty days' work and cost \u00a336 - 5s; Lock worked on it for twenty days.  Lock was an exceptionally capable draughtsman who understood the Rococo idiom more fully than any other English furniture designer.\n\nThe table was given by Mrs. F.E. Rhodes."

            "physical_description": "Mirror, carved, gilded wood, extremely ornate.  Bold carved and gilded wood mirror surmounted by a tasselled canopy over a shell and hare head with C-scroll and acanthus leaf motif on either side. The right hand side bears a female caryatid (Ceres or Proserpine possibly) crowned with a bountiful fruit basket. Her body is based on an S-scroll decorated with leaves which looks not unlike a harp. Beneath her is a C-scroll quiver full of hunting weapons which point out of the mirror. This turns into clam shell detailing (facing inwards) in which we see a sunflower from the centre of which leaps a hound. The external, bottom corner both have a dolphin motif. At the centre base of the mirror is the floral and feathered nest of two mythical birds who are protecting their eggs. The left side of the mirror has the same hound and sunflower motif leading up to the same quiver of hunting weapons but above this the S-scroll becomes an atlantes (a male caryatid). He wears an acorn bell on a chain and has a collar of acanthus on a costume of leaves. He is bearded and has a leaf head-dress (possibly Pan or the Green Man). Again he is surmounted by a bountiful fruit basket.\n\nAnalysis of paint and gilding layer stratification on this pier glass and the pier table, W.35-1964, carried out by Pascale Patris, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, December 2003; report in curatorial file for W.8-1960",

The original design (shown alongside) shows that it took eighty-nine days to make the table, and cost \u00a322 - 5s - 5d for the joiner and \u00a321 for the carving.  Lock worked on it for fifteen days, the remainder being done by his assistants.  The design for the mirror shows that it took one hundred and thirty days' work and cost \u00a336 - 5s; Lock worked on it for twenty days.  Lock was an exceptionally capable draughtsman who understood the Rococo idiom more fully than any other English furniture designer.\n\nThe table was given by Mrs. F.E. Rhodes. [pre October 2000]\nBritish Galleries:\nMatthias Lock designed this mirror and table as a set with two candlestands, to go between a pair of windows. Such a set was a traditional form but Lock added newly fashionable motifs. The mirror  was still symmetrical and large in scale, showing little of the lightness and asymmetry of Rococo.

The mirror was often accompanied by a matching table, as with this example.\n\nPeople\nThis mirror was made for John, 2nd Earl Poulett (1708-1764), for the Tapestry Room at Hinton House, Hinton St George, Somerset. The Mr Wood who was paid for 15 hours work on the mirror may be Alexander or Stephen Wood, both of whom worked in London's Southwark district as looking-glass makers in the 1720s.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe design of the mirror was inspired by contemporary French prints engraved by Jacques-Gabriel Huquier (1695-1772) after Jacques de Lajoue (1687-1761) which were published in 1737 as Livres de Bordures d'ecrans \u2026 la Chinois. Similar scroll-caryatid figures feature in Matthias Lock's own designs for Six Sconces published in 1744. The original sketch for this mirror shows that the joint between the panels of mirror glass was concealed by garlands of flowers suspended from the rabbit's head above. The sketch is inscribed '138 Days in all / Lock 20 / Lomar 40 / Wood 15 / Loo 14 the other by &c / Charged for Carving \u00a334 10s 0d / for Joyneurs & stuf \u00a31 15s od / A Large Sconc in the Taptstrey Roome'.",
