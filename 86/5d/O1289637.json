The full scene shows the Sea-King and Princess of the Sea raised on the left watch the dancing by the \u2018Goldfish, Sea Plants, Fish and Sea Currents\u2019 (as they are called in the Coliseum programme) while Sadko on a rock (centre back) plays his gusli. Signed \u2018Allinson\u2019 in the bottom left hand corner.\n\nSadko was described as a \u2018fantastic ballet in one act\u2019. Initially, in 1911, the Ballets Russes had presented scene 6 of Rimsky Korsakov\u2019s opera with vocalists as well as dancers but to provide a novelty for the second Ballets Russes tour of North America Adolph Bolm choreographed a new ballet (without singers) re-using the set by Boris Anisfeld and with costumes by Natalia Goncharova. Sadko was previewed before the tour Teatro Victoria Eugenia in San Sebasti\u00e1n, Spain on 19 August 1916. It was first performed by the Ballets Russes in London on 31 October 1918 at the Coliseum Theatre and the production had its last ever performance at the London Coliseum 12 February 1919. For London the cast was led by Lubov Tchernicheva (Princess of the Sea), Jean Jazvinski as Sadko and M. Whitworth Junes as the Sea-King.\n\n\u2018Sadko, a great Russian minstrel, played so wonderfully upon the national instrument, the gusli, that once when he went to sea, the daughter of the Sea-King fell enamoured of him.\nTo gratify her desire she caused a great storm, imperilling Sadko\u2019s vessel. Aware of the source of the danger, Sadko threw himself into the sea to save the lives of his companions.\nOn his arrival in the realm of the Sea-King he was welcomed and invited to play to the court. He did so and soon all the inhabitants of the sea were dancing to his tune. The dance became wilder and wilder, and set the whole of the sea in motion. Seeing that he had caused the storm to rise again Sadko broke the strings of his instrument and made his escape to the upper world, taking with him his sea-bride.\n\nAllinson\u2019s drawing suggests the format for a frontispiece for a booklet in Cyril Beaumont\u2019s series Impressions of the Russian Ballet but this was never produced.",
