I can hardly fancy you with any other than the smooth face I remember, but yr Mama tells me you have a goodly pair of whiskers. I do not hear that you have yet followed the Moustache Movement but before long I expect that Law, Physic and Divinity will be breaking down the barrier which custom has so long set up - not so very long either judging from the pictures of George Herbert who of course is an acquaintance of yours, and if you are his acquaintance, you must be also, with yr good taste, his admirer? A happy New Year 1857 to you and the assembled family party is sincerely wished by yr affectionate Aunt.\n\nE. W. Tomlinson",
