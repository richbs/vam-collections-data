This type of marble was highly prized in Roman times.\nBy the 19th century this specific kind of marble was so rare that the interest of patrons of tables like the present piece was focused on displaying the antique stone. The border design of the slab is closely related to 16th century Roman examples, whereas the table reinterprets the style of French furniture from the period of Louis XIV.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
