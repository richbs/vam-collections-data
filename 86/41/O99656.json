Although the mark is similar to that used at Vincent Dubois' factory at the rue de la Rocquette, this factory closed in 1790, a date that is probably too early for this model.\nThe mark was also used at the factory founded by Jean-Marx Clauss in rue de la Pierre-Lev\u00e9e in around 1820. The factory changed ownership after 3 generations, when it was acquired by Achille Bloch, during whose ownership this group was probably made. Production of its 'porcelaine de Paris' continues to this day.\nA series of 14 groups all from Chardin's paintings was made at the request of Achille Bloch around 1908 and produced until 1970.",
