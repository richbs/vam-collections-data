A number of similar boxes were decorated with characteristically bulbous figures and motifs in moulded gesso, with punch marks in the background, and often painted vermillion and partly gilded. As in Italy, courtly love stories taken from Medieval Romances were popular themes in Catalonia and thought suitable presents for lovers.",
