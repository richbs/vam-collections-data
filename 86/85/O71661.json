In 1971 his work was shown at the Electrum Gallery, London, alongside that of German jewellery makers Claus Bury and Gerd Rothmann. All three broke with convention by combining a non-precious material, such as acrylic, with gold. Maierhofer then went on to experiment with an even wider range of materials, including tin and Corian. \n\nIn the early 1980's Fritz Maierhofer became fascinated by the soft texture and malleability of tin which he combined with gold to make jewellery expressing movement. The concept was that through the softness of the tin, the ring or bracelet could be rolled or accordingly unrolled on the finger or arm of the wearer. It was a commission in 1979 by Hans and Peter Anderson (now Pierre Lang Company), known for tin-production wares, which inspired this body of work.",
