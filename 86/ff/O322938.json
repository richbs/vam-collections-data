From 1873 Thomas Jeckyll (1827-1881) designed a number of cast iron and brass fire grates in the fashionable Japanese taste for the firm. He was particular fond of the sunflower as a decorative motif, and his greatest achievement, a great cast iron Japanese pavilion (now split up), shown at the Philadelphia 1876 and Paris 1878 Exhibitions, was decorated with iron sunflowers.",
