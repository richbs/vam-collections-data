However, if the handkerchiefs were decorated they could also be carried purely as fashionable accessories and given as gifts. In such cases they often incorporated the initials of their owner in an elaborate monogram, particularly if they were part of a trousseau. Some of the most ornamental were of whitework embroidery, made with such skill that they were reversible, being equally fine on each side, and trimmed with hand-made lace. \n\nThis example has the initial A with a crown.  It is likely to have belonged to Princess Alexandra, wife to Queen Victoria\u2019s eldest son Edward, and later his queen.",
