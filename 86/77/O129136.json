Usually aimed at children, such books were popular in Japan towards the end of the Edo period (1615-1868). 'The Battle of the Monkey and the Crab' is a Japanese folk tale in which a crab avenges the murder of its parent by a monkey.\n\nThe story begins with the monkey tricking the crab into exchanging his rice ball for the monkey's persimmon seed. The crab plants the seed and nurtures it until a fine persimmon tree grows. When the tree brings forth its fruit, the crab realises he is unable to climb the tree to retrieve it and asks his friend the monkey to bring it to him. \n\nThe greedy monkey climbs into the branches and devours the fruit, throwing the hard unripe persimmon at the protesting crab below. The crab dies in the onslaught and the monkey runs away. When the crab's child realises the monkey is responsible, he calls upon his friends, shown here as an octopus, a mortar and a pestle, to help avenge his parent's death.\n\nThis sheet is a copyist's drawing and would have been copied from Kuninao's original sketches. The copyist's drawing is usually destroyed when the initial printing block is carved. The survival of this sheet suggests that the designs were never realised as finished prints.",
