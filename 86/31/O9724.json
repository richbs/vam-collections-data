            "public_access_description": "This painting designed by the Mughal court artist Jagan, and painted by Asir, is an illustration to the Akbarnama (Book of Akbar), commissioned in 1589 by the emperor Akbar (r.1556\u20131605) as the official chronicle of his reign. It depicts the execution of Shah Abul Ma\u2019ali at Kabul, in present-day Afghanistan, in 1564. \n Shah Abu\u2019l Ma\u2019ali had been in service to Akbar's father, Humayun, but from the beginning of Akbar\u2019s reign in 1556 displayed rebellious tendencies. He was despatched on pilgrimage to Mecca to prevent him stirring up sedition, but returned unchanged and after making an unsuccessful attack on Mughal forces escaped to Kabul. The seriousness of the threat he posed is demonstrated by the attempt on Akbar\u2019s life that took place shortly afterwards. When the emperor visited the shrine of Nizam ad-Din Awliya in Delhi, a man in the crowd shot him with an arrow, wounding him quite seriously. The would-be assassin was put to death, but was discovered to have links with one of Abu\u2019l Ma\u2019ali\u2019s allies. Meanwhile, in Kabul, Abu\u2019l Ma\u2019ali\u2019s illustrious family antecedents had persuaded the politically powerful lady Mah Chuchak Begum to give him her daughter in marriage. The union ended in catastrophe: Abu\u2019l Ma\u2019ali murdered his mother-in-law and had other family members and servants killed, for which he was hanged. The Akbarnama, written over 25 years later, describes Abu\u2019l Ma\u2019ali throughout in vituperative terms, and the author concludes that with his death \u2018the world was cleansed of his hateful existence\u2019. [English translation, Beveridge, vol. II, pp. 317-22] \nThe Akbarnama was written in Persian by Akbar\u2019s court historian and biographer, Abu\u2019l Fazl, between 1590 and 1596, and the V&A\u2019s partial copy of the manuscript is thought to have been illustrated between about 1592 and 1595. This is thought to be the earliest illustrated version of the text, and drew upon the expertise of some of the best royal artists of the time. Many of these are listed by Abu\u2019l Fazl in the third volume of the text, the A\u2019in-i Akbari, and some of these names appear in the V&A illustrations, written in red ink beneath the pictures, showing that this was a royal copy made for Akbar himself. After his death, the manuscript remained in the library of his son Jahangir, from whom it was inherited by Shah Jahan.\n\nThe V&A purchased the manuscript in 1896 from Frances Clarke, the widow of Major General John Clarke, who bought it in India while serving as Commissioner of Oudh between 1858 and 1862.",
