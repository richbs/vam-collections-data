Went to sea at the age of ten, then worked as a house-painter, studying art with a drawing-master called Bird. Moved to London in about 1822; worked for Thomas Homer on the panorama of London seen from the dome of St Paul's which opened in the Colosseum, Regent's Park, in 1829, and as a scene-painter at the Pavilion Theatre. Exhibited three paintings at the RA between 1828 and 1838, 15 at the BI 1827-40, and 27 at the Society of British Artists 1829-38. All were marine and coastal scenes, and naval engagements; two visits to Holland in the late 1830s resulted in Dutch views. Visited Madeira in 1840, but, never in good health, died in Brighton 28 or 29 October 1840. There are eleven watercolours by him in the V&A collections. The painter George Chambers junior, exhibiting in the 1850s, was his son. Although his works were auctioned after his death (details of the sale are unknown), a subscription had to be raised in the <i>Art Union</i> to support his family. \n\nLIT: \tJ Watkins <i>Memoir of George Chambers</i>, Whitby 1837; <i>Art Union</i> 1840, pp186-7 (obit), 1841, pp8, 34, 122-3; J Watkins <i>Life and Career of George Chambers</i> 1841 \n\n<b>Seascape</b> \n1823-1900 Neg HF958 \nCanvas, 52.1 x 64.8 cm (20\u00bd x 25\u00bc ins) \nSigned and dated 'G Chambers, 1833' br, and inscribed 'G C 1833' on centre boat \nAshbee Bequest 1900 \n\nA letter from Chambers to John Watkins in September 1833 indicates that the artist had just spent some time in Sussex, 'At Tunbridge Wells, Lewes, Brighton, Shoreham, etc' (Watkins 1841, pp73-4); this painting may be a result of that trip. Also in 1833, he exhibited 'A Portsmouth Ferry-boat Crossing to the Isle of Wight' at the SBA (361).\"",
