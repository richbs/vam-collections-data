Like Catholic women elsewhere in southern Europe they often wore elaborate crosses as jewellery.\n\nThe design of this cross is based on 18th century aristocratic jewellery, but the use of garnets and pearls is typical of Italian traditional jewellery of the 19th century.  The tiny loop at the top shows that it was originally part of a much larger and more imposing piece of jewellery.  This would have hung vertically from a ribbon, secured by a large loop or hook at the back of the topmost element.  Crosses like this were worn throughout northern and central Italy, often with matching earrings.\n\nThis cross was bought as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
