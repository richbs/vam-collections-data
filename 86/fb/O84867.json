He was billed as \u2018The Famous Little Comedian\u2019. It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre. He compiled them in a series of albums. Foy was on the bill at Hanley that week with Jordan and Harvey, who were also drawn by Cooke.\n\nTom Foy (1879\u20131917), \u2018The Lancashire Lad\u2019, was born into the business and started performing in circus. He made his name in the halls with \u2018The Lancashire Lad in London\u2019, the sketch he performed at Hanley. Foy played the innocent lad from Sowerby Brig with a broad Yorkshire accent who, trying to get a job in a gentleman\u2019s house in London, had fits that could be stopped only by the gift of a shilling. A local reviewer said that Foy and his company kept the audience \u2018in a continuous roar of laughter at the funny dialogue and grotesque antics of the Yorkshire lad\u2019. Like most music hall performers, Foy also worked in pantomime. He played Idle Jack in Dick Whittington at the Shakespeare Theatre, Liverpool, in 1909.",
