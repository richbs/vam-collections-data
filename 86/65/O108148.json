It led from the the Red Fort, Shah Jahan\u2019s fortified palace, and was 40 yards wide and 1,520 yards long.\n\nOriginally, a canal ran the entire length of the road and into the Fort, providing water for drinking and irrigation. The canal fell into disuse and was covered over by the British between 1840 and the 186s. This photograph shows the raised cement bed that runs through the centre of the road where the canal used to be.\n\nThe British photographer Samuel Bourne lived and worked in India between 1862 and 1869. During this time he toured the Himalayas and travelled through the subcontinent, photographing its landscape, architecture and historical sites. He set up a studio in Simla with Charles Shepherd and sold his prints sold to an eager public both in India and Britain.",

The sides of the road are lined with shops and artisans selling their wares. The road was built in 1650 by Jahanara Begum, the daughter of the emperor Shah Jahan as an accompaniment to the Red Fort, Shah Jahan\u2019s fortified palace. The road led from the Red Fort and was 40 yards wide and 1520 yards long.\n\nOriginally, there was no name for this road, it was known as the bazaar in the direction of Lahore. A canal ran through the entire length of the road and into the Fort providing water for drinking and irrigation. It fed a row of trees that lined the length of the road. The canal went into disuse and was covered over by the British between the 1840-60s. This photograph shows the raised cement bed that runs through the centre of the road where the canal used to be. Although trees are still evident in this picture, early accounts suggest that there were many more providing much need shade. (Spear: The canal was restored in 1829 nu was covered over in 1910 and now runs underground)\n\nWhen the road was built, it was lined with pillared galleries  which were divided into small rooms under arches and which housed shops. At the back of each shop there was a small warehouse to keep surplus stock, and the merchants and their families lived above the warehouses. The shops sold a huge variety of goods such as food, spices, flowers and precious jewels. \n\nSections of the street had particular names and functions; directly outside the fort was Urdu Bazaar and served the soldiers, servants and artisans of the palace, a bit further down was the Ashrafi (Moneychangers) or Jauhari (Jewellers\u2019) Bazaar. Although the street is today known as Chandni Chowk, originally the name referred only to a chowk or \u2018square\u2019 with a central pool, a bit  further down the street. There is some discussion as to how the square got this name. Popular legend refers to the way the moonlight (Chandni) reflected in the pool in the evenings but it could also refer to the silversmiths (Chandi) situated around the square, thus making it either Moonlight or Silver Square.\n\nThe architectural historian, James Fergusson's observations of the street when he visited in 1835-42:\n \u2018..Chandni Chauk, a noble wide street, nearly a mile long, planted with two rows of trees, and with a stream of water running down its centre\u2019. \n\nA History of Indian and Eastern Architecture, James Fergusson, London, Vol II. 1910, \nPg 309.",
