Lindsell Stuart as King Eric VIII in The Queen's Husband at the Brighton Theatre Royal during the week of 29 February 1932, advertised as 'direct from the Ambassador's Theatre, London.'. It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years. Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nThe comedy The Queen's Husband by Robert E. Sherwood originally opened in London at the Ambassadors Theatre in October 1931, produced by Barry Jones and Maurice Colbourne. Barry Jones was a great success as King Eric VIII, the perplexed king of an imaginary island state who changes from hen-pecked husband to monarch after the revolution that takes place when the Queen is in America. It transferred to the New Theatre in March 1932 with Jones as the king, the part played by R. Lindsell Stuart in Brighton. A review in the Brighton press noted the beautiful staging with its sumptuous royal apartments and splendid uniforms, and that Lindsell Stuart played the king 'with ease and grace.'",
