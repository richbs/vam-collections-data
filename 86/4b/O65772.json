It was produced by the Gebr\u00fcder Thonet manufactory. While still using the caned seat of earlier designs, the apparently simple structure of the settee and its corresponding chair (W.42-1979) is more sophisticated than that of most earlier bentwood chair models. The geometry of this design and the cut-out motifs used on the backrail were equally novel. \n\nUnfortunately, the designer is not known; the settee may have been a product of the Thonet design studio. Both settee and chair remained in production from at least 1905 to 1911.",
