The very full skirt flares from a hip yoke which is high at the front and lower on the hips at the back. The bodice and skirt are trimmed with a feather pattern in silver sequins and rhinestones interspersed with ostrich feathers with rhinestone centres. The design is most densely clustered on the bodice, becomes larger and sparser on the skirt and ceases at knee level in the front and just above the hem at the back. There are ostrich feathers stitched around the bodice. The bodice is lined with satin and boned with 's' boning at the breast.  It fastens with hooks and eyes and a zip. The skirt is mounted on a white silk underskirt over which is a small nylon bustle, a stiff nylon petticoat and two layers of soft nylon tulle. The waist has been extensively altered.",

Balmain\u2019s fellow couturier Christian Dior (1905-1957) explained, 'a ball dress may be entirely covered with millions of paillettes, or pearls, each one of which has to be put on separately'.",
