However, it served mostly as a decorative feature rather than as a practical object for robust, daily use. The cabinet was reportedly given by the donor's grandfather Jean Baptiste Kohn  to her parents as a wedding present in 1912.\n\nMaterials & Making\nLacquer panels were commonly used on the most important, exposed parts of bamboo furniture.  Hidden parts such as shelves and the inside of cabinets were covered with paper embossed with a bamboo leaf pattern. This was imported from Japan in large rolls and then cut to suit requirements.\n\nTrading\nThe materials used for making bamboo furniture came almost solely from Japan.  According to the donor, the cabinet was made in this country. However, it is possible that the whole cabinet was made in Japan (to a design by Jean Baptiste Kohn) and exported in sections, with more fragile parts, such as the mirror glass and the glass for the cabinet doors, added on arrival in Britain. This possibility is supported by the fact that an insurance statement from Tokyo was found under one of the lacquer panels.  However, this may have come with the panels themselves or as packing material.",
