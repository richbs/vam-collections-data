The supplementary effects obtained by reserving the ground by the wax-resist method. The main pattern consists of a row of pyramidal hills upon which stand a large vase flanked by two small vases. From the large vase rises a tree bearing a variety of large flowers and leaves, and in the two smaller vases are bunches of similar flowers.\n\nApplied borders on the sides and along the bottom with a pattern of winged boys in a garden, dogs, birds, and pavilions.\n\nColours are reds, violet, blues, yellow and black. Outlines in black and red. Over-painting for the green.",
