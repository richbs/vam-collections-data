            "history_note": "During the 1830s William Henry Fox Talbot invented a way of making paper negatives and from them multiple paper prints. In doing so, he laid the foundations of modern photography. Calvert Jones learned of these developments in 1839 through a neighbour who was a cousin of Talbot. Jones lived in South Wales and he made many photographs there and in the West of England. He also travelled widely, making photographs on the continent. Jones' work stands out in the early development of photography because he was one of the first to apply a schooled artist's eye to the medium.\n\nJones used these sun splashed steps as the location for four portraits in this album. The two men in the photograph reflect each other, both as a pattern of dark and light and in their body stances. The use of strong horizontal lines often appears in Jones' work, in this image the stone steps are a sculptural background to the two figures.",
