His wife Henrietta Ward, of the other, more famous, Ward family, was also an historical painter; their five children were artists, notably Sir Leslie Ward, the caricaturist 'Spy'. \n\nLIT: \tArt Union 1847, p260; Illustrated London News, xxvi, 31 March 1855, pp301-2 (engr portrait); Art Journal 1855, pp45-8; Magazine of Art 1878, p18; The Times 17, 18, 19 January 1879 (obit); Athenaeum 25 January 1879, pp128-9 (obit); Art Journal l879, pp72-3, 84 (obit with engr portrait); J Dafforne The Life and Works of E M Ward 1879; ed \nE O'Donnell Mrs E M Ward's Reminiscences 1911 \n\nCharles II and Nell Gwyn\n 528-1882 \nCanvas, 34.8 X 29.8 cm (13\u00be\u00d7 11\u00be ins) \nSigned and dated 'E M Ward/1854' on wall bl \nJones Bequest 1882 \nAmong several paintings illustrating episodes from the life of King Charles Il, one of Ward's favourite subjects, was 'Interview between Charles II and Nell Gwynne, as witnessed by Evelyn' exhibited at the RA in 1848 (587). The RA catalogue appended a quotation from John Evelyn's famous diary for 1 March 1671: \nI thence walked with him through St James's Park to the garden, where I both saw and heard a very familiar discourse between [the King] and Mrs Nelly, as they called an impudent comedian, she looking out of her garden on a terrace at the top of the wall, and [the King] standing on the green walk under it. I was heartily sorry at this scene ... \nAccording to the Art Journal (1855, p46), the RA painting was bought by the collector John Gibbons; it does not appear in any of the posthumous sales of his collection. The museum files refer to a larger version of the subject, different in certain details to the present work, in a Gibbons family collection; its present whereabouts are unknown. The present work is presumably a smaller version of the RA exhibit. An almost identical version was sold at Christie's New York 19 May 1987 (101, signed and dated 1859, 92.3 X 73 cm). \nPROV: \t?Sold Christie's 22 June 1867 (111), bought Bourne \u00a326 Ss, probably for John Jones (he also bought lot 96, Frith's sketch for 'Measuring Heights', also later in the Jones Bequest, 511-1882) \n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
