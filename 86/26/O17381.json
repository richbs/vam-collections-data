It is one of the artist's most beautiful and justifiably famous pictures. Constable's father owned Dedham Mill, and he worked there as a boy, on and around the river Stour. The sun is just breaking through the rain clouds after a shower, the grass and foliage glistening brightly in the light.  Such effects were Constable's forte, and the principal aim of his life and work.  But together with his observation and recording of the 'real' atmosphere of landscape, there co-existed the fervent expression of his emotions about the countryside of his earliest years which resulted in his predominant place in the history of Romantic art.  He himself wrote: 'Painting is for me another word for feeling, and I associate my \"careless boyhood\" with all that lies on the banks of the Stour; these scenes made me a painter, and I am grateful'.",

(some col.).\nExhibition catalogue\n<u>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</u>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, pp. 127, 128\nThe following is an extract from the text of the entry:\n\nSheepshanks Gift.\nThe canvas has been relined at an unknown date.\n\nDedham Mill belonged to Golding Constable, and the artist worked in it as a boy.  No. 113 [ 145-1888] is an oil sketch from nature for the painting, and a related pencil sketch is mentioned under the entry on that sketch.  The following versions by or attributed to Constable are recorded:\ni A sketch on panel, sold as Lot 46 at Messrs. Sotheby\u2019s, 15 April 1953.  11 x 14 \u00bd ins.  This came from the collection of G. Hilditch, and is said to be the work sold as Lot 39 of the Executors\u2019 sale, 16 May 1838, \u2018Sketch of a Mill on the Stour\u2019, bought by Hilditch \u00a37 17s. 6d.\nii Tate Gallery No. 2661. 21 x 30 \u00bc ins.  This is a full-scale oil sketch with no boat in the left foreground, and no tow-horse in the right foreground (L. ed. S., Pl. 61a)\niii A picture in the Currier Gallery of Art, Manchester, New Hampshire, U.S.A. 21 \u00bd x 30 \u00bd ins.  Signed below on right <i>John Constable.  London</i>  Formerly in the collection of the Spedding family, members of which were friends of Constable\u2019s.  A letter of 19 January 1841 from C.R. Leslie to Maria Constable refers to the acquisition of it by Miss Spedding, and states that this version tto was painted in 1820.  This is similar to No. 184 [F.A. 34], but the rope from the boat is attachedto the bollard, and not to the harness of the tow-horse.\n(<i>Burlington Magazine</i>, Vol. XCVII, 1955, p. 54, fig. 25)\niv  A picture from the T. Horrocks Miller and T. Pitt Miller collections sold as Lot 17 at Messrs. Christie\u2019s, 26 April 1946.  28 x 35 ins.  This picture may have been acquired by Mr. Thomas Miller, who was forming his collection of British paintings around the year 1850 (W. P. Frith, <i>My Autobiography and Reminiscences</i>, I, 1887, p. 261).  For Holmes\u2019s discussion of this version, see below.\nV A picture in a private collection.  Inscribed on the back <i>J. Constable F. London 1827</i>.  In this version the mill has gothic windows.  It is reproduced (fig. 26) and discussed in relation to Nos. 113 and 184, the pencil sketch in the Gilbert Davis collection, and ii and iii above, by Beckett in the <i>Burlington Magazine</i>, Vol. XCVII, 1955, pp. 52-55.\nConstable exhibited \u2018A Mill\u2019 at the British Institution in 1819 (No. 78, framed measurement 39 x 47 ins.).  Holmes, p. 244, identifies this exhibit either with No. 184 [F.A. 34] or iv above.  The identification of one of the versions of \u2018Dedham Mill\u2019 with the picture exhibited in 1819 is plausible on grounds of style, title and the date of the sketches, and is not inconsistent with the framed measurements given in the British Institution catalogue.  But it could not be No. 184 [F.A. 34], since that is dated the following year.\nHolmes also identifies either No. 184 [F.A. 34] or iv with Lot 80 in the Executors\u2019 sale, 16 May 1838, \u2018Dedham Mill and Church\u2019, bought by Brown for \u00a345 3s.  No certain conclusion can be reached in the absence of Mr. Sheepshanks\u2019 records, but he was actively buying works by Constable at this sale, and Frown may have been acting for him.  As the note on iv shows, Mr. Thomas Miller belonged to a slightly later generation of collectors.\nFor a repetition of the central section of the composition see the sepia drawing No. 410 [249-1888].\nEvans, M., with N.
