They were mostly played by fashionable ladies to accompany themselves singing, but this particular instrument was used by the orchestra of the Royal Pavilion at Brighton. Robert Warnum the elder (ca. 1742\u20131815) traded from 42 Wigmore Street, London, publishing music and selling pianos and stringed instruments. His son, also called Robert (1780\u20131852), carried on the business, and although he specialised in pianos, it was most likely he who capitalized on this particular craze.",
