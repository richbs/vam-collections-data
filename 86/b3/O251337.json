Inside her mantle and covering the central part of her gown she wears a surcoat, ending in a tasselled cord which emerges from under her mantle between her feet. On her head she wears a veiled coif with wimple, which is edged at the back with tassels. Because she wears a veiled coif and wimple this figure does not represent the Virgin, but rather an older siant. Unfortunately because her hand have been broken off (and with them anything she might have been holding) she cannot be identitifed beyond dispute, however it seems possible that she represents St. Anne. Figures such as this were displayed in small tabernacle-shrine, often with painted wings.",
