The base is mahogany, circular, and fitted with four bun feet. Attached to the inner face of this base is the inner pine frame, circular with a square central opening. Four square section struts, attached to this inner frame at the bottom, are screwed together at the top to form a shaped junction at the narrowest part of the hour glass shape.
