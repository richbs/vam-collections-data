It was attached to the belt by four studs at the back and is of a type commonly in use in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The position of the inscription and monogram indicate that the plate was worn at the waist rather than on the shoulder.\n\nOwnership & Use\nDuring the wars with France that lasted from 1793 to 1815, the possibility of a French invasion was a serious threat to British security. Many local Volunteer units were raised, often by local landowners inspired with patriotic zeal. This form of belt-plate was popular with the officers of a Volunteer company and the Latin motto Pro ares et focis ('For hearth and home')  was very common.\n\nThe Volunteer company with which this belt-plate was associated was almost certainly raised in Yorkshire. The monogram engraved on the plate is likely to be that of the Brooke family, perhaps the father of the donor who presented it to the museum in 1864.",
