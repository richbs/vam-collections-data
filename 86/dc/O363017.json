A gently-scrolling stem with tendrils, leaves and flowers, runs along the belt. In the wider parts of the hanger are slightly larger exotic flower motifs. The edges are outlined with a thicker metal-thread cord. The suede is stretched over a thick piece of plain leather and backed with matching suede.\n\nFragments of cream watered silk are attached to the back of the hanger and to one other piece but these are probably of a later date.\n[Sword belt] Part of sword belt, virtually unaltered and consists of a straight length, curving and widening at one end to form the hanger. The wide end is divided into two short tabs to which the actual sword carriers were attached. Only one of these is still attached and this has been cut at the top and its position altered. The narrow end of the piece is pointed and has a heart-shaped metal tong attached to facilitate buckling. There are, however, no eyelet holes to take a pronged buckle. There are three sets of marks where pieces have been joined on to the outside of the curved end.\n[Sword belt] Part of sword belt, which is straight and has been altered at both ends. One end has been cut across diagonally and the other, which appears to be in its original form, has been folded back to take a large metal buckle. There are no eyelet holes through which to fasten the buckle. There are at least two sets of stitch marks at the slanted end and the marks of a curved stitch line near the buckle end.\n[Sword belt] Part of sword belt, which is straight and cut at both ends. One end shows the beginning of the original curved or pointed ending. There are also marks of sewing at this end.\n[Sword belt] Part of sword belt, with a square ended tab from the hanger. The original sword hanger has been replaced with a large piece of later leather. There are two sets of stitch marks at the top, which has been cut, as has the tab which once attached to T.408-1970.",
