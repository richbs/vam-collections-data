Silk production was not native to Egypt and silk weaving of this kind may have been imported and is therefore of particular interest and value. The size of the panel and shoulder band suggest that this may have come from a child's tunic (probably a boy's given the motif), and that he must have come from a high ranking family. The hunting theme includes a mounted figure in the middle surrounded by ibises, fish and duck. These come from the repertoire of late classical art and they represent the hunt as both a sport and a source of food.",
