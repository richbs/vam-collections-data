The text is as follows: Designs (2 elevations) for a room decorated with statues of pagan gods in niches between the windows and busts of Roman emperors in roundels above the windows Pen and ink and wash 9 1/8 x I5 \u00be (232 x 400) 2258 9 x I5 3/8 (229 x 391) 2259 PROVENANCE W. Y. Ottley (as indicated by the mounts); Sir T. Lawrence; S. Woodburn (sale, Christie, 4-14 June 1860, bought for the Museum) Formerly attributed to Taddeo Zuccaro. Mr Pouncey first recognised the hand of Zucchi, and Mr Edmund Pills bury discovered that the drawings are preliminary designs for the gallery of the Palazzo RuceIJai, now Ruspoli in the Via del Corso, Rome. The walls and ceiling were decorated by Zucchi, who wrote an account of the iconography in his Discorso sopra li dei dei gentili e le loro imprese, Rome, 1602 (reprinted in F. Saxl, Antike Cotter in der Spatrenaissance, Leipzig and Berlin, 1927, with illustrations). There are two views of the gallery in a book published by the Cassa di Risparmio di Roma, entitled Via del Corso, Rome, 1961, p. 154, figs. 156 and 157, which show that the work as executed differs in certain points from these designs. The round niches containing the busts of the Roman emperors were placed low down between the windows instead of above them, and the full length figures shown standing in niches between the windows in the drawings were placed above the windows, where for lack of room they sit instead of stand. There are five other drawings showing the walls of the same gallery in the Royal Institute of British Architects and in the British Museum. Mr Pillsbury states (in a letter dated 20 November 1967) that there are two drawings showing another scheme for the same gallery in the Masson Collection in the Ecole des Beaux Arts, Paris. They are in the folios entitled 'Ornements itaIiens,' inscribed 'Zucchi'. The latest account of the artist is Pillsbury's description of the frescoes in S. Spirito in Sassia, Rome, in The Burlington Magazine, 116, 1974, pp. 434ff. The date of his death is given here as 1596 (p. 434, n. 2) and that of the Rucellai decorations as 1585 or 1586 (p. 443, n. 47)\u2022",
