Tiny cuts and folds of the book's pages have been made to create the illusion of miniature fir trees growing out of the text.\n\nThe artist was interested in making collapsible art and the cut out images can be pushed back into the page and the book shut and shelved.\n\nThe accompanying artist's statement indicates how the work should be displayed, 'The book should be kept horizontal or tilted to a maximum of about 30 degrees, not hung on a wall. The box is purely a framing device and I have exhibited the book outside of it [and] in a larger museum case which allows the book to be better lit, i.e. from behind so that the trees cast shadows'.",
