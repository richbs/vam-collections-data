They were probably worn as a decorative addition to the front of a shoe belonging to a child or a woman. \n\nGold or silver buckles for shoes were in fashion for most of the 18th century. They gave the finishing touches to elegant dress and were one of the few pieces of jewellery worn by men as well as women. Gentlemen wore matching shoe and knee buckles. \n\nMaking buckles became a highly skilled craft in England and in France. Exquisitely wrought designs, glittering pastes and precious stones reflected the status of the wearer as well as the occasion. Cheaper and plainer versions were made of steel, brass and other metal alloys. \n\nBy 1790 shoe buckles were falling out of use, except as part of ceremonial or court dress.",
