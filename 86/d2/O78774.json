The source of this image of Queen Victoria is a photograph taken by Alexander Bassano in 1882. He was a well-known society photographer who traded between 1878 and 1903 at 25 Old Bond Street. This photograph became one of the most popular images of the Queen and was used on many commercial commemorative items. \n\nThe overall floral design of the cotton is very typical of small-scale patterns popular for dress during the latter years of the 19th century. This cotton cloth was made for working-class use as children's clothing and for accessories such as sashes, scarves and waistcoats intended for wear at Jubilee celebrations. It would have been cheap to buy. The use of an image of Queen Victoria's is significant as it marks the height of the Queen's popularity with her poorer subjects who, in earlier periods of her reign, had been her greatest critics.",
