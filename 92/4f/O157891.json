The form is typical of South German goldsmiths' work. The London marks on the present cup, however, suggest that it was either made in England by a German goldsmith, or imported from Germany and marked upon arrival. Either interpretation is possible.\n\nDocumentary evidence and survivals show that a substantial amount of German silver came to England in the late-16th and early-17th centuries. Provided that this silver met the higher standard of English sterling silver (92.5 percent pure silver), plate could be assayed and hallmarked upon arrival in England. Records also show that there were a number of German artisans working in London, for as one German visitor commented in 1613 'the goldsmiths in London were [until recently] nearly all Germans' (R. Lightbown, 1970).\n\nThis object forms part of the Gilbert Collection. Sir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
