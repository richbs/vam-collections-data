Miss Firbank (1888-1954), daughter of the affluent Member of Parliament Sir Thomas Firbank and sister of the novelist Ronald Firbank, patronised many of the top London dress-makers and tailors of the time. This collection forms an invaluable record of a stylish and wealthy woman's taste between about 1905 and 1920. Many items were shown in an exhibition at the Museum in 1960: 'Lady of Fashion: Heather Firbank and what she wore between 1908 and 1921'.\n\nThe trend for tailormade garments for women began in sportswear with riding habits made by their husband's tailor. In the 19th and early 20th century a woman of Firbank's standing would have had a tailormade tweed ensemble for shooting or golfing (see T. 20-1960) and several tailormade costumes like this for city based activities such as shopping and visiting.  In this example the black velvet exterior is contrasted with a bright blue and black striped silk lining.\n\nRedfern of Conduit Street was one of the most prolific and prestigious couturiers of the Edwardian period with outlets in London, Edinburgh, Manchester, Paris and New York. The popularisation of the ladies tailor-made garment is widely attributed to its founder John Redfern.",
