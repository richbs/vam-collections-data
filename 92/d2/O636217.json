Whistler's first major suite of prints, his 'French Set' brought critical acclaim but disappointing sales.  Seeking more generous patrons, he moved to London in 1859. Initially under the influence of his brother-in-law Francis Seymour Haden, a pioneer of the 'etching revival', he began a series of superbly observed and finely detailed views of the River Thames with its shipping, thriving wharves and picturesque characters.\n\nThe subject and composition are closely related to Whistler's brilliantly innovative oil painting of the same year, Wapping, (National Gallery of Art, Washington), which he kept secret from rivals such as Courbet for fear that his ideas would stolen.",
