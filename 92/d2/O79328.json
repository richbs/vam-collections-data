Although most of the pieces in the group are Yemeni, the piece immediately before this was described as from the neighbourhood of Bukhara in Turkestan, and this clasp also is much more likely to be from Bukhara than from the Yemen.  The shape of the clasp, the floral repouss\u00e9 patterns, and the use of pave-set turquoises are all characteristic of Uzbek jewellery.",
