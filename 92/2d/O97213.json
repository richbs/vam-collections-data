Once the Sadler's Wells Ballet moved to Covent Garden in 1946, it had to build up a repertory suited to a larger theatre and stage and show off the full company.  Frederick Ashton's Cinderella in 1948 was the first to establish a British tradition of full-evening ballets and a tradition continued by Kenneth MacMillan.\n\nMacMillan originally created Anastasia as a one-act ballet - a psychological investigation into the mind of the alleged survivor of the Russian Imperial family.  In 1971 he used this work as the third act of a three-act ballet of the same name - expanding the action to show the Imperial family and the disintegrating society of the pre-Revolutionary period.  Kay's designs for Act I perfectly captured the atmosphere of the sepia photographs of the period (the Russian Imperial family were enthusiastic amateur photographers) and of the Russian seaside.  The curved spirals then became the architecture of the ballroom in Act II and the hospital walls-cum-projection screen for Anastasia's memories in Act III.\n\nSarah Woodcock."
