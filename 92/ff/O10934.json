A fruited grape vine is entwined around the body of the cup and cover, while an infant Bacchus, grasping a bunch of grapes, forms the finial. The male and female term figures forming the handles hold in their hands Bacchic attributes, the male with a bunch of grapes and a pan-pipe, and the Bacchante with a drumstick and tabor (tambourine). Among the fruited vine crawl a variety of naturalistic creatures and insects.\n\nStylistic Influences\nThis cup and that illustrated in Heming's trade card of about 1761 derive from Continental designs of the 1740s, most notably those of Pierre Germain (1720-1783), and show Heming was well aware of developments by leading Parisian goldsmiths at mid-century. A more direct stylistic influence, however, is that of Rococo pieces of the 1730s and early 1740s by master goldsmiths working in England, for example Frederick Kandler (active 1735-1778), Paul de Lamerie (1688-1751) and George Wickes. Heming produced a number of cups and covers with these ornamental elements, and can be said to have been a precursor of the Rococo Revival style which was to fully develop in the first decades of the 19th century.",
