'Jesse Tree' windows are a visual representation of Jesus Christ's genealogy which was traced back to Jesse, the father of the Old Testament Prophet/King David. \n\nThese prophets announce the coming of Christ from the line of David and appear on the Tree accompanying images of Christ's royal ancestors. The whole window would have culminated at the top with either an image of Jesus Christ or an image of the Christ Child with his mother, Mary. At the bottom of the window would have been an image of Jesse from whom the genealogical Tree emerges.\n\nThe prophet here can be identified by the name 'DANIEL (in reverse). He lived in the 6th century BC and his prophecies are recorded in the Old Testament Book of Daniel. His visions related to the establishment of the Messianic Kingdom and is thus intimately associated with the geneaology of Jesus Christ. Jesse Trees with their kings and prophets were produced in all forms of church art from the 11th century and throughout the medieval period. There was no standard convention for the depiction of the prophets and the kings.\n\nThe style of painting on this figure is the same as on those in panels 5D and 6 to 6B-1881. The facial features are full and rounded. The eyebrows are heavy and the eyes and pupils of the eyes are large. The clothing follows the form of the body. The figures' hair is straight and not curled. These figures are identified by their inscribed scrolls, have a large stemmed flower within the demi-quatrefoil they stand in and there are no small sections of ground between their feet. All of these feaures distinguish this group of prophets from the other group (5 to 5C-1881). The whole figure in this panel is the reverse of that in no. 6-1881 indicating that they were made from the same cartoon or design drawing.\n\nTwo other panels in the museum (Mus.nos. 6D and 6E-1881) depict Kings from a 'Jesse Tree' window but were not originally part of this series of prophets panels.",

Grodecki notes that the Saint Denis Jesse window is original. Viollet le Duc used the Chartres one as a model in his reconstruction. Are some original bits but it is largely a reconstruction and the choice of prophets and texts are not original on the whole.\nJohn K.

            "history_note": "Origins of prophet panels:\nAt the time of acquisition, it was believed that this panel and others in the V&A's collection (5A-E-1881 and 6-6E-1881) had originally been located in the windows of the Sainte Chapelle in Paris. This chapel had been restored in the 19th century and some of the medieval windows were removed.\nPrior to 1936 opinion had changed and it was thought that the original location of these panels was Troyes Cathedral, possibly in the axial chapel. In 1779 the central window of this axial chapel had been removed.\n\nHistory of Troyes Cathedral:\n(c.1200) Work started in the eastern choir, leaving the axial chapel last.\n(c.1200-10) First phase of work.\n(c.1210-1220s) Second phase of work.\n(1228) Much wind damage to cathedral and collapse of the upper choir. So there probably had been damage to the Jesse window which would account for a 15-year gap in styles. \n(1779) Central window the axial chapel removed (not for revolutionary reasons)\nJesse apparently occupied the centre light with Life of Virgin and typological Life of Christ on either side\n(c.1800?) 4 STG panels from a Tree of Jesse were indentified amongst the shattered glazing of the axial chapel after the Revolution\n(1837) Arnaud: descriptions of 4 panels of a Jesse Tree located in the lowest parts of the two facing windows of the Public Life of Christ in the 2nd and 6th bay of seven-bay axial chapel\n                \tKing David plays a \u2018rote\u2019\n                \tSolomon carries a cithar in his hand\n                \tMary holds a palm branch\n                \tChrist is blessing\n(1955) Jean Lafond: Chapel's central opening (reconstruction?)\n\t\tLife of Virgin - Jesse Tree - Life of Christ\n\t\t\t\tOR\n\t\tLife of Christ - Jesse Tree - Life of Virgin\n(1958) Grodecki noted that the V&A prophet panels were of a similar quality to the Jesse panels at Troyes.\n\nJesse Panels at Troyes:\nLocated in the current Jesse window in a north ambulatory chapel:\n1) \tKing panel: Daniel [?], holds a guitar like structure and a bow which goes across the instrument and not on the shoulder\n2)\tKing panel: Solomon [how identified?]\n3)\tVirgin panel\n4)\tChrist panel \u2013 topmost as is arched\n\nPaston Comments on why V&A panels are from Troyes window:\n1) \tmeasurements match height of Troyes panels\n2) \tall would fit into the axial chapel window\n3) \tall panels exhibit similar pitting\n\nA series of prophets at the V&A have been associated with the glass at Troyes since Grodecki (1958). The dimensions of the panels (65 x 36) fit perfectly in the axial window and complement the trunk figures. However, the prophets of this series are executed with a vaiety of pictorial styles associated with the years 1220 and 1230. This suggest that they were completed in a certain period and that they are probably from a ancient disruption of the glassmaking.",

Visual Representation of Tree of Jesse:\nJesse Window\nA window whose design is based on the descent of Jesus from the royal line of David, usually in the form of a tree springing from Jesse (David's father) and ending in Jesus or the Virgin and Child, with the intermediary descendents placed on scrolls of foliage branching out of each other.\nJesses appear from 11th century\n(1086.)

It is reasonable to think the representation in a window was based on an earlier minature. Because a group of prophets appears in the Chartres window, it isn't a given that it came from the Limoges prophet drama. Jesses can have or can not have genealogical tables.\n\nIV.

Christ's ancesters were believe to trace their line back to Jesse, the father of the Old Testament Prophet King David. \nThese prophets announce the coming of Christ from the line of David and appear on the Tree accompanying images of Christ's royal ancestors. The whole window would have culminated at the top with either an image of Jesus Christ or an image of the Christ Child with his mother, Mary. At the bottom of the window there would have been an image of Jesse from whom the genealogical Tree emerges.\n\nTwo other panels in the museum (Mus.nos. 6D and 6E-1881) depict Kings from a 'Jesse' Tree' window but were not originally part of either of these series of prophets.",
