Prior to coming to the museum, it was bought by Sydney Vacher who obtained it from the Marcioni-Lucatelli collection of maiolica. Vacher gave this jug to the museum in 1914.\n\nIt is likely that the jug was found in a similar context to other pieces of maiolica known to have been found in pozzi (wells) in Orvieto. Around the turn of the 20th century, a great deal of building work was going on in Orvieto including replacing the old medieval system of plumbing. Many pieces of so-called 'archaic maiolica' were brought up out of wells and thus from unstratified contexts.",
