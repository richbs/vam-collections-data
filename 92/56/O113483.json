The mysteries associated with the night fascinated the British artist Paul Nash (1889-1946). He explored the notion that sometimes only the trees witnessed events that took place after dark. \n\nIn an accompanying poem Nash describes this scene. \n\n\u2018A place of gibbet-shapen trees and black abyss           \nWhere gaunt hills brooded dark and evil\nGirdled by dense wet woods and rushing streams\nA dread place seen only in dreams\nOf which there is no history but this \nThat on yon' stony tor\nAn angel fought a devil.\u2019",
