            "public_access_description": "Benjamin Vautier (1829-1898) was born in Morges, near Lausanne. He first took drawing lessons from Jules H\u00e9bert (1812-1897) and subsequently became a pupil of Carl Ferdinand Sohn (1805-1867) and Rudolf Jordan (1810-1887) in D\u00fcsseldorf (1850-53). In 1857 he settled permanently in D\u00fcsseldorf and achieved a successful career.\n\nThis painting is a fine example of Vautier's genre scenes, a category he specialised exclusively. The present work shows a group of children after school and was probably executed based on some ethnographic studies Vautier brought back from the Bernese Oberland. By comparison with similar compositions, Vautier probably painted this composition in the 1850s. This type of sentimental and anecdotic genre scene was quite popular and attracted collectors during the second half of the 19th century.",
