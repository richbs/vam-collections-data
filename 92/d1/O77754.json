It was made specifically for export to the West and is typical of the kind of object made in response to the growing overseas demand for Japanese products.\n\nTime\nIn the 1850s Japan opened its ports to foreign trade. As a mass of goods and information about the country reached the West, a craze for all things Japanese swept across Britain, Europe and the United States. In the second half of the19th century craftsmen in Japan made large numbers of objects that catered for this taste. Many of these, like this chest of drawers, were relatively cheap and affordable.\n\nHistorical Associations \nJapan was eager to take advantage of the western fascination for its products and exhibited many objects at the big exhibitions that took place in Europe and the United States in the 19th century. Japan organised its first display for the Paris International Exhibition of 1867. This chest of drawers was one of the objects exhibited on that occasion. The Japanese display was very successful and the V&A bought a number of objects, including nine straw-work boxes and cabinets.",
