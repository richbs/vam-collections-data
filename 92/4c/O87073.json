It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years. Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nViolinist, pianist, composer, singer, cabaret star and well loved broadcaster, Peggy Cochrane was one of  the most versatile radio celebrities. At the age of eight she was the youngest pupil at the Royal Academy of Music. When she was fourteen she won both the open pianoforte and the open violin championships on the same day, and the same year she had her first two ballads published. She was a well-known broadcaster in the 1930s and in 1951 was a regular member of the cast of the BBC radio programme Happy Go Lucky starring Tony Hancock.",
