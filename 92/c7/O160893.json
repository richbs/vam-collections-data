Slightly concave sides in the upper half. There is a border along the bottom and part way up the sides. It has a black ground with a downward pointing almost triangular arrangement of pink and mauve or pink and white blossoms on a pair of green leaves and a fine yellow base line, which could represent a bowl.  The spaces between these are filled with triangular forms.  Pairs of similar triangular forms on a dark ground edge the main pattern.\n\nThe main pattern is a series of dark diagonal lines from lower right to upper left.  \n\nThere are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: mauve ground with downward pointing isolated stylized flowers: red segmented one alternating with a red semi-circular one with white serrated edge.\n[2] wider stripes in three designs: [a] large red bell-shaped blossom with 2 pink and green leaves pointing to the lower right alternating with downward pointing stem and a large serrated mauve leaf containing small leaves and other motifs. [b] small downward pointing cypress with diagonal rows of tiny pink or white blossoms forming the diamond shape alternating with a straight chevron stem pointing to the lower right with 2 small and one large pink flowers. [c] wider than the other two: light and dark blue speckled vase with a triangular pink blossom surrounded by 13 pink and white flowers alternating with a pink and white speckled vase and the same design in different colours: central blue flower and 11 pink flowers.",
