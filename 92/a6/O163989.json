Haselden was a self-taught artist who produced both political and theatrical cartoons, originally for Sovereign magazine from 1902-1903 and in 1904 for the next 31 years for the Daily Mirror. He was offered a knighthood by Stanley Baldwin but turned it down because he 'didn't want all that fuss'.\n\nPaul Robeson (1898-1976) is depicted in his leading role in Eugene O'Neill's play All God's Chillun Got Wings which opened at London's Embassy Theatre on 13 March 1933. Paul Robeson gave a moving performance as Jim Harris, the generous-hearted 'noble savage' transported to New York where he battled to keep up with the fast pace of life and fell in love with Ella, played by Flora Robson. Critics agreed that Mr Robeson and Miss Robson made a perfect dramatic partnership.",
