Round Ottoman clasps are never completely circular \u2013 they always have a protrusion, however slight, on the two ends.  The women who owned them sewed them onto cloth belts which they made themselves, usually richly embroidered.  \n\nCypriot clasps are part of the general Ottoman tradition, but are often more sophisticated and decorative than those from elsewhere.  The goldsmiths of Cyprus were famous for their filigree although they rarely marked their work.",
