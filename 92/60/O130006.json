The factory was set up in 1922 by Du Jinsheng in a pioneering effort to industrialise silk manufacture in China. It specialised in weaving paintings and photographs into tapestries such as this.  \n\nThe image woven on this piece is based on an award-winning photograph by Hungarian photographer Erno Vardas in 1934. The original photograph is in black and white, so the colours here were selected by the weaver. The woven picture successfully captures the essence of light of the original photograph.  \n\nThe factory's fortunes suffered a decline in 1937 with the onset of the Sino-Japanese war and the Japanese Occupation. However, it resumed business sometime after the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, and during the Cultural Revolution years it operated under the name of 'Hangzhou East is Red Silk Factory', producing propaganda images. The Museum has some of these pictures in the collection.",
