Huqqa bases were traditionally either bell-shaped or globular. This example is much like a contemporary decanter, but with a flaring foot to add both stability and an element of Middle Eastern or Indian style.\n\nRetailers & Traders\nThe export market for English cut lead glass in the late18th century and the first half of the 19th was huge. As early as 1752, the London glasscutter and retailer Jerome Johnson was advertising 'Turkish and Indian Fashions, Hubble-Bubbles, Springel Glasses for Exportation ...'. This trade was later taken up by John Blades of Ludgate Hill, and by his associates Mathews & Jones, who had a warehouse in Calcutta in the 1820s selling 'a superb assortment of lustres, wall and table shades, hookahs, dessert services, toilet and useful glassware, cut and plain ...'. The Indian princely taste for opulence was well served by the enormous range of British glass on offer - heavy, lustrous, deeply and accurately cut by hand with the aid of steam power.\n\nOwnership & Use\nGlass huqqa bases would have been fitted with their flexible tubes and mouthpiece in the countries for which they were destined. Few if any complete specimens are known to survive, and certainly not in Britain. This example is almost certainly, therefore, a failed export - old stock which fell out of fashion and remained, unused, in Britain.",
