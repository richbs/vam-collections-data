This bowl is a good example of one of the crucial innovations of the Jin dynasty (1115-1234).\n\nPrior to the 13th Century, Chinese potters created their wares by forming the body of the piece, glazing and then firing it in a kiln. As colourful glazes became more popular, potters were limited by the fact that many glazes ran together during firing, blurring their design.\n\nAround 1200, at various kilns, potters began to initially cover the body with a transparent glaze and fire it to the very high temperatures required for the clay to harden fully. Then, the colourful enamels were painted onto the surface and the whole piece was re-fired to the lower firing temperature of the enamels. The result of this experiment was to evolve into the elaborate and colourful 'overglaze enamel' designs of later centuries.",
