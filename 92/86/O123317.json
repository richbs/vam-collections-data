            "public_access_description": "The lid of this small ivory casket has a large central cartouche with a complex, lobed outline. The cartouche is filled with a symmetrical design of scrollwork set with stylized leaves. The leaves are known in English as half-palmettes, and the scrollwork pattern as a whole is called an arabesque. The spaces around the central cartouche contain scrolls set with flowers shown in profile and head on. The sides of the casket are inscribed with three couplets of a poem in Arabic. They are written in the thulth style of script. The groups of letters are arranged to fill the space rather than to be read in a straight line. On the base is a pattern of flowerheads and small square compartments. The compartments are framed by four C-scrolls, and the design in the centre imitates basket weaving. \n\nThis decoration is deeply and crisply carved. When finished, it was given a coating of varnish, which has pooled in the more deeply cut parts of decoration. The pale brown colour of the varnish in these areas makes the design easier to read.  \n\nThe decoration includes European motifs such as Rococo Revival C-scrolls, which appear in Iranian decorative arts from the 1850s. Yet the arabesque on the lid and the Arabic inscription are clearly Islamic in character. \n\nFor most of the 19th century, arabesques and other Islamic patterns tended to be dense and relatively small-scale, even miniaturised. Towards the end of the century, however, designers trained in art schools began to create new types of patterns. They are based more or less loosely on those used in Iran in earlier centuries, and they often incorporate novel features. One example is the way the half-palmettes in the very centre of the lid were left plain so that they stand out boldly against the surrounding decoration. This is evidence that the casket was made in Iran, probably in Tehran, in the 1880s or later.\n\nThe casket is lined with burgundy silk, and the lid is fitted with a mirror, which is probably original. The presence of the mirror suggests that the casket was designed to store cosmetics or the tools for applying them.",
