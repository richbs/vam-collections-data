London: Oxford University Press, 1946-49. Vol 1: London and Middlesex, Surrey, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire. p.201.\n'Three prominent natural features were taken as nuclei of the recording in this country, and for that reason landscape subjects are rather more frequent than among the drawings of the other counties in the volume.  It is true that such natural conformations are not susceptible to alterations in structure, but their appearance is liable to, and in many cases is in danger of, change.\n\nThe first of the three features is the chalky escarpment, a continuation of the Chilterns, swerving up from Dunstable through Toddington, Harlington, Sharpenhoe Clappers, Barton-in-the-Clay to Hexton, and rising in places to above 800 feet.  In this area lie many fine buildings - Dunstable Priory, Wrest Park (near Silsoe), and the church at Chalgrave, - as well as the old lime-kilns at Sundon, and the quarry at Totternhoe whence was taken, in 1169, stone for Windsor Castle.\n\nSecondly, there is the ridge of green sand running from the other side of the Buckinghamshire boundary eastwards through Woburn, Ampthill, and Shefford; a strip of land rich in natural and architectural beauties and rare literary associations.  It links the Cowper country (above the Brickhills) and the John Bunyan country - not only the places where they lived but the scenes which again and again were the inspiration and matter of their writings.  In the history of our literature, this corridor of fifteen miles is unsurpassed in sanctity, in peculiar purity.\n\nLastly, there is the river - not the Lea, making its brief, customary appearance at the back of the stage, this time near Luton, but the Great Ouse.  By this, and by its vassal streams the Ivel, the Hiz, the Purwell, and the Oughton, most of Bedfordshire is watered.  So characteristic, and so charming, are the smiling and gentle valleys beside these waterways that several of the villages (near Bedford) and one of the valley scenes were recorded.  What would be seventeen miles for a crow is, for the rambling Ouse, forty-five.'",

In 1940 the Committee for the Employment of Artists in Wartime, part of the Ministry of Labour and National Service, launched a scheme to employ artists to record the home front in Britain, funded by a grant from the Pilgrim Trust. It ran until 1943 and some of the country's finest watercolour painters, such as John Piper, Sir William Russell Flint and Rowland Hilder, were commissioned to make paintings and drawings of buildings, scenes, and places which captured a sense of national identity. Their subjects were typically English: market towns and villages, churches and country estates, rural landscapes and industries, rivers and wild places, monuments and ruins. Northern Ireland was not covered, only four Welsh counties were included, and a separate scheme covered Scotland.\n\nThe scheme was known as 'Recording the changing face of Britain' and was established by Sir Kenneth Clark, then the director of the National Gallery. It ran alongside the official War Artists' Scheme, which he also initiated. Clark was inspired by several motives: at the outbreak of war in 1939, there was a concern to document the British landscape in the face of the imminent threat of bomb damage, invasion, and loss caused by the operations of war. This was allied to an anxiety about changes to the landscape already underway, such as the rapid growth of cities, road building and housing developments, the decline of rural ways of life and industries, and new agricultural practices, which together contributed to the idea of a 'vanishing Britain'. Clark also wanted to help artists, and the traditional forms of British art such as watercolour painting, to survive during the uncertain conditions of wartime. He in turn was inspired by America's Federal Arts Project which was designed to give artists employment during the Great Depression of the 1930s.\n\nOver 1500 works were eventually produced by 97 artists, of whom 63 were specially commissioned. At the time the collection had a propaganda role, intended to boost national morale by celebrating Britain's landscapes and heritage. Three exhibitions were held during the war at the National Gallery, and pictures from the collection were sent on touring exhibitions and to galleries all around the country. After the war, the whole collection was given to the V&A by the Pilgrim Trust in 1949, and it was documented in a four volume catalogue published between 1946 and 1949. For many years the majority of the collection was on loan to councils and record offices in each county, until recalled by the V&A around 1990. The pictures now form a memorial to the war effort, and a unique record of their time.",
