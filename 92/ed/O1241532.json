Born in Buenos Aires, he lives and works in London where he studied at the Slade School of Art, and later at Goldsmith's.  To accompany his recent solo exhibition at the ICA, Bronstein has created two versions of a hand-coloured etching, Cafeti\u00e8re in the Piranesi Taste 2011 (this one is 'Silver Gil't, the other was 'Wedgewood Blue'). \n\nCafeti\u00e8re in the Piranesi Taste depicts a fanciful version of a coffee pot in the style of 18th-century Italian artist Giovanni Battista Piranesi. Piranesi was famous for his fictitious images of monuments, many in a state of near-collapse, and he also designed replica Roman objects for the Grand Tour tourist trade, a style which subsequently influenced the decorative arts of the period. Bronstein's coffee pot, depicted as a building within a landscape, is both a play on scale and a reflection of the social hierarchy represented through objects. Prints by Piranesi are well-represented in the V&amp;A collection.",
