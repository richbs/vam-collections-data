This dress is likely to have been designed by Fath\u2019s wife and muse Genevi\u00e8ve, who upon Fath\u2019s death in 1954, oversaw the house until it closed in 1957. \n\nWhile the dress\u2019s surface is a soft, delicate lace, in contrast the underpinnings are highly structured: its petticoat features a boned bodice and a crinoline skirt. The pale violet colour and two-tiered skirt suggest a romantic view of women\u2019s fashion.",

(pl.7.8).  He had been invited by Lady Jebb (later Lady Gladwyn), wife of the British Ambassador in Paris, to sketch the return state banquet at which the queen had entertained president Ren\u00e9 Coty at the British Embassy in Paris.  At the time, he had written to his hostess, saying 'The Queen triumphed over Hartnell's bad taste'.  Despite this, he was delighted to accept the ivory satin evening dress, encrusted with beads, brilliants and gold.  Beaton succeeded in acquiring several other dresses worn during the same visit.  Lady Gladwyn donated the lilac lace evening dress [T.173-1974] by French designer, Jacques Fath.  Lady Diana Cooper, Lady Gladwyn's (and Beaton's) great friend, donated a strapless Balmain gown of appliqu\u00e9 printed silk satin [T.50-1974].  Baroness Alain de Rothschild (Mary Chauvin de Treuil), the wife of one of the Rothschild banking brothers, gave a white spotted tulle dress by Dior [T.121-1974] (all pl.7.9).\nSir & Lady Gladwyn Arrive For State Dinner [at the Opera on the first night?].

She wore it with her 'Aunt Amie's wreath' - a wreath-like tiara worn forwards. \n\nDuring the state visit, Mme. Dufy - Lady Gladwyn's vendeuse at Fath - attended her at the Embassy to dress her.  On the first evening she wore a lime coloured satin gown, and on the second she wore a white tulle gown with red velvet bows on the back.  The latter dress was sketched by Cecil Beaton who was also attending: \"...at half past one Cecil Beaton was stilll sketching Diana Copper and Anne Nrowich in the Ionian Room.  He then wanted to do me, but I aws too sleepy, and after a few minutes posing, went to bed\" -<i>The Diaries of Cynthia Gladwyn</i>, p.210.\n\nCecil Beaton collected several of the dresses worn during the events of this particular state visit \u2013 the Queen\u2019s dress, T.264-1974; Diana Cooper\u2019s dress, T.50-1974; and the Baroness Alain de Rothschild\u2019s dress, T.121-1974.",
