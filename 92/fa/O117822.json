They date from the 1st century BC to about AD 480 and depict stories from the lives of the Buddha (the Jatakas).\n\nThis painting represents a ceiling panel of the main shrine in cave 2. The design is dominated by a lotus rosette in the centre from which concentric bands radiate. Each register has a different design. In the four corners are small dwarf-like figures with sweet faces and big bellies. Surrounded by clouds, they are flying towards the Buddha and carry offering trays of flowers in their hands.\n \nThe cave complex was discovered in 1819 and attempts were made to document the paintings inside them. In 1844 Major Robert Gill was commissioned to make copies. Unfortunately most of the paintings he completed were destroyed in a fire in 1866. To make up for this loss, from 1872 to 1885 John Griffiths from the Bombay School of Art and seven Indian students spent every winter at the caves. This is one of the approximately 300 paintings they produced.",

They depict stories from the lives of the Buddha (the jatakas) and date from the 1st century BC to about AD 480. The cave complex was discovered in 1819 and since then attempts have been made to document the paintings inside them. In 1844 Major Robert Gill was commissioned to make copies. Unfortunately most of the paintings he completed were destroyed in a fire in 1866. To make up for this loss, from 1872, John Griffiths from the Bombay school of Art and seven Indian students spent every winter for the following 13 years at the caves producing approximately 300 paintings, of which this is an example.",
