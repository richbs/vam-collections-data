The necklace itself consists of two strands of hollow oval silver beads, separated by hollow quatrefoil beads, which alternate with the oval beads and hold the two strands apart.  Each of the beads on the lower strand, and each of the quatrefoil spacers, has a loop on its lower edge to hold a pendant.  The pendant attached to each oval bead consists of four hollow beads, shaped like lozenges, quatrefoils and hearts, hung vertically, separated by rings, and ending in a hollow crescent-shaped bead with an oval bead hanging from each end of the crescent.  The pendant hanging from each quatrefoil spacer is shorter, consisting of a baton of twisted wire ending in a pendent oval bead.  All the beads, of all shapes, are decorated with applied filigree on both sides, and the quatrefoils, hearts, crescents and lozenges also have a turquoise-coloured glass bead set on their fronts.  The necklace beads are all strung on brown cotton.  At each end, the two strands of cotton are gathered into a hollow triangular terminal bead, and twisted into a single cord as they emerge at the far end.  The lower strand has broken, leaving four of the longer pendants detached.",

They were particularly renowned for the quality of their filigree work, which was worn and appreciated as much by Muslim as by Jewish women.\n\nThis workmanship on this necklace is not typical of Yemeni jewellery of the 19th century, although the design, called a labbeh, is one of the most characteristic types of Yemeni work.  The hollow beads, shaped like quatrefoils, hearts, lozenges and crescents, and decorated with imitation turquoise and applied filigree, are found in two other 19th-century pieces at the V&A.  It is likely that they were all made in the Yemen, even though the use of these kinds of bead seems to have died out by the 20th century.",
