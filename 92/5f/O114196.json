He visited the dramatic mountain scenery to be found in the north of England, Scotland, and Wales, or the ancient churches and other mediaeval buildings, showing a keen nostalgia for the romantic past preserved in Britain or in northern Europe. Newman Hall, like many others, would sketch in the open air, pausing perhaps during a walking-tour to record a particularly attractive view.",

All these notebooks and sketchbooks were probably at 17 Dennings Road where the Holton family moved in about sixty years ago. The owner then was Miss Ethel Playle who died in the 1950s. Mrs Rose Holton gave the notebooks and sketchbooks to Hampstead Museum, which subsequently donated the sketchbooks to the Victoria and Albert Museum.",
