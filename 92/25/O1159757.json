It has been made by Clothkits, a popular company in the 1970s and 1980s. \n\nClothkits specialised in making clothes making kits that were easy to use. Fabric pieces were pre-printed with pattern guides so there was no need for fiddly pattern pinning to the fabric. The kits supplied everything needed to make the dress including thread, buttons and a branded Clothkits label to sew in to the neckline. They also produced ready to wear examples to buy for children's and adult ranges for those who did not want to create their own garment.\n\nThe Clothkits closed in 1988 but the label was bought and re launch in 2008 by artist Kay Mawer who employed artists to design fabrics for the kits including screen printer Jane Foster who designed this distinctive Birdie print, taking inspiration from a Scandinavian tradition of animal imagery and a vintage 1970s retro feel.",
