Above the handles are formal ornaments of palmettes and scrolls painted in purple monochrome. A border of scrolls, rosettes and diaper-panels similarly painted runs round the lower part of the cup. There are bands of plain gilding round the foot and the inside of the lip, and the upper parts of the handles are similarly gilt. The saucer is decorated at either end with a four-lobed panel outlined with purple, painted with scenes similar to those on the cup. Between these and following the rim of the saucer, are oriental motifs consisting of a diaper-panel flanked by scrollwork, all painted in purple monochrome. A diaper-panel similarly painted decorates the centre of the saucer inside the trembleuse lattice.\n[Cup] Cup of inverted bell-form with elongated vertical sides and two ear-shaped loop handles pointed at the apex and terminating in pairs of knobs.
