Very similar hatching was used in contemporary Italian engravings, and it has been suggested that this drawing is preparatory to such a print. The mount with its wash lines is Padre Resta's (1635-1714).'\nWard-Jackson, Peter, <u>Italian Drawings. Volume I. 14th-16th century</u>, London, 1979, pp. 19-20 The following is the full text of the entry: (?) PARENTINO, BERNARDO (1437- I 53 I) 14 Venus and Cupid trampling on a serpent beside an altar Inscribed in ink 'm.i.' as in Lugt 2981. Inscribed on the mount 'Antonio Poll [aiulo]', the last two syllables being torn away Pen and ink on vellum 9! x 61 (242 x 171) Dyce 149 PROVENANCE Padre Resta (see below); Lord Somers (no. m. 1 as. in Lugt 2981); Dyce Bequest 1869 LITERATURE <i>Dyce Catalogue</i> no. 149 (as by Antonio Pollaiuolo); Reitlinger, p. 7, no. 7 (as North Italian, late 15th century); J. Byam Shaw, 'A lost portrait of Mantegna and a group of Paduan drawings' in OMD, 9, no. 33, June 1934, p. 4 and pl. 7; Z. Wazbinski, 'A propos de quelques dessins de Parentino pour le Couvent de Santa Giustina' in <i>Arte Veneta</i>, 17, 1963, pp. 21-6 and fig. 25 The name Antonio Pollaiuolo is written against the number m.1. in the Resta MS in the British Museum (described in Popham, <i>Resta</i> ; Lugt5 2981; and Lugt, <i> Supplement </i>, p. 419). Byam Shaw places the drawing in a group of drawings that he ascribes to Parentina, and Wazninski endoreses the attribution. The latter compares the Venus and the Cupid with the figures in a scene showing a sacrifice in Parentino with certainty. The name is, nevertheless, a convenient one to cover a fairly homogenous group of Paduan origin, dating from the end of the 15th century or the beginning of the 16th. The drawing is similar to no. 12 above in handling, composition and mood, as well as in the artist's predilection for slender, androgynous women with long legs, narrow hips and small high breasts. The drawings might even be by the same hand. But some of the similarities are generic rather than particular, and if we compare the left hand of each goddess, which is in exactly the same position in each drawing, holding a vase, the differences in handling suggest two different artists. The use of the left hand to hold the vase may mean that both drawings were designs for engravings.",
