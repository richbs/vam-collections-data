No underdrawing is visible. There is a narrow dark line along the top and bottom, incomplete because of the condition of the edges; the lower line goes part way up both sides. The main pattern is a series of diagonal lines from lower right to upper left.  No chevron lines have been worked but there are lines worked in small diagonal stitches - the colours used seem rather random. Most of the pattern is worked in outline only.\n\nThere are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: there is a lot of dark green outlines for leaves. Clusters of small yellow flowers, like hydrangeas, alternate with a downward pointing angled stem with red flowers pointing to the lower right.\n[2] wider stripes in two designs: [a] downward pointing stem from trefoil base with three large yellow flowers alternating with a small black vase with 5 yellow hydrangeas. [b] small dark vase, yellow 4-petalled flower with a yellow hydrangea either side, a triangular arrangement of 3 dark leaves, red flower to either side and yellow flower in lowest point of diamond shape alternating with short straight stem, red 4-petalled flower below 3 yellow ones, pair of dark birds either side of a dark trefoil with a red flower to either side and a red flower in the lowest point.",
