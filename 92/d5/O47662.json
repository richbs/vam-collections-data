He wears a 16th century style doublet and breeches, the doublet with wide vertical slashing to the front and full, slashed sleeves, the slashings edged in gold revealing a black and gold undershirt beneath, the breeches banded with diagonal stripes of gold on each leg and with large gold rosettes and a double string of white beads at the knee, and red gloves, stockings and low heeled shoes, each shoe decorated with a gold rosette, and a voluminous red cloak with gold tassels. On his head is a large plumed hat, the wide brim curving upwards to the front and edged in gold lace, and a full mask in the form of a skull, with a fringed gold scarf covering the sides and neck. The balstraded staircase is sketched in pencil. Fabric swatches in shades of gold and shades of red are attached by metal pins to the right hand edge. The design is signed and is inscribed in pencil with the production title, the theatre, the scene and the name of the character and the actor.",
