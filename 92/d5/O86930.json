Grant as Sylvaine in the melodrama Leah Kleshna, which he performed at the Theatre Royal, Hanley, during the week of 5 November 1906. It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre of Varieties in Hanley. He compiled them in a series of albums.\n\nLeah Kleshna by the American playwright C. M. S. McLellan was a success in London when it was first produced at the New Theatre in 1905, with Lena Ashwell as Leah Kleshner. After the London run ended, the play toured the provinces and first came to the Theatre Royal in Hanley in 1905, although not with Grant as Sylvaine. Described at Hanley as having \u2018a plot that stirs the blood\u2019, it concerned the relationship of Leah Kleshna and the politician Paul Sylvaine. The couple met when Leah broke into his house, having been trained by her father as a professional burglar. William Grant later appeared as Malcolm Petrie in A White Man at the New Theatre in London in 1909. He died in 1923.",

McLellan, first performed in London at the New Theatre in May 1905, and subsequently on tour in the provinces when William Grant took the role of Kleshna. William Grant also appeared on the London stage as Malcolm Petrie in 'A White Man' at the New Theatre in 1909. The caricature comes from the second album of caricatures in a collection of albums owned by the Theatre Museum compiled by the graphic artist George Cooke.  It is labelled by the artist 'Geo Cooke HYS BOOKE' and features music hall performers working in the early 20th century.",
