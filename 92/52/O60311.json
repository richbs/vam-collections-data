The exhibition was a showcase for Art Nouveau design, and many of those who had created the style, such as Emile Gall\u00e9 and Louis Majorelle, displayed their work there. As always, large commercial firms were quick to pick up the new ideas. Perol Fr\u00e8res, who made this piece, was a large cabinetmaking firm that had been founded in 1875 in the heart of the traditional furniture-making quarter of Paris, the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. For the 1900 exhibition they produced good-quality commercial versions of the newest designs for the general market.",
