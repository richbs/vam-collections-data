In older models the backs of the eyes were painted with a fluorescent colour.  When light fell on them, they would glow in the dark for a while, giving them a ghostly look. After 1963, the owls were given green and black plastic eyes with a black edge, swivel heads and feet made from sturdy wire and covered with felt.  The smallest size owl had a felt beak while the larger ones had plastic beaks and, after 1954, voice boxes.",
