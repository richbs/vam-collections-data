The region\u2019s natural gold resources had made the Asante wealthy and court regalia, which included textiles (kente), ivory and gold, reflected high levels of skill and technology. \n\nThis band of gold with a raised design of foliage and scrolls probably formed part of court regalia. The small holes punched around its edge suggest that it was attached to something, possibly to a state stool. \n\nA large number of pieces of gold court regalia found their way to Britain after British forces invaded the Asante capital of Kumasi on 4 February 1874. The Asantehene, Kofi Karikari, fled leaving behind much precious regalia which was captured. The Asante were also forced to pay a war indemnity of 50,000 ounces of gold, the first instalment of which was handed over at Adanse Fomena on 13 February 1874.",
