Mounted coconut vessels were popular items on the European buffet from at least the 13th century, evoking exotic and unknown worlds overseas, and were originally credited with magical and pharmaceutical properties, such as the power to detect the presence of poisons or to act as an aphrodisiac. Although mounted coconuts were often found in collecting cabinets, most often as standing cups and sometimes with zoomorphic mounts resembling, among other creatures, owls, ostriches or eagles, they do not seem to have been considered as rare as other exotic materials, like mother-of-pearl, nautilus shell, ivory or horn. By the late 16th century skilfully carved nuts (often with Old Testament scenes or mythological stories that appealed to Mannerist sensibilities), were highly valued, but the mounts on this unworked coconut must have been valued in their own right and demonstrate the goldsmith's skill in engraving, chasing and casting.",
