Both young children wear short white frocks and have bare feet, and the larger is waving a hat; the older girl wears a broad-brimmed hat, two-tiered dress and shawl; and the little girl has a white dress with a tucked hem.\n\nThe painting has a cut mount with an oval window which is gilded at\nthe edge of the aperture, and a glazed frame of gilded wood with a deal backboard.",
