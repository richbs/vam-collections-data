In 1949, she appeared in London with the Ballets des Champs-Elys\u00e9es and was acclaimed for her interpretation of the title role in the ballet \"La Sylphide\".  \nThe soles of ballet shoes were often scored, either by the manufacturer or the dancers, to give improved grip on stage. \nThe shoe came to the Museum as part of the Cyril Beaumont Bequest.\n\nHistorical significance: An example of a French ballet shoe of the mid 20th century.  Ballet shoes made in different countries are indicative of the different needs of the dancers and the choreography of the time.  \nThe ballet shoe is the most personal of dance aretfacts, as each dancer is responsible for darning and stitching on the ribbons to suit her own personal preferences and each dancer 'wears' out the shoe in a different way, according to her physique and the role.  The dancer darning shoes is a potent image in 20th century dance iconography, a symbol of at once her drugery and humility.  \nA shoe worn by a great dancer in a particular role on a certain night (such as a premiere) and signed, dated, and dedicated to the recepient, implying that the recepient was with the dancer at the time, attains almost iconic significance for balletomanes.",
