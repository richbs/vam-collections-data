The humeral veil is draped across the shoulder of the wearer as a shawl or cape, and the two ends wrapped around the hands of the priest or deacon, which would be carrying the monstrance (a ceremonial vessel which displays the consecrated host) or the ciborium (a small covered vessel that stores unused consecrated communion hosts). \n\nSilks were the prescribed textile upon which humerals were made. While red is usually associated with the feast day of a martyr, and pomegranates (and blossoms) symbolic of the passion of the Christ, the central motif suggests a possibility that this humeral may also have been used on a more specific occasion. The phoenix-like bird may have been intended as a symbol of the Holy Spirit, which in Christianity is often depicted as a dove. As red is also the colour of the Feast day of Pentecost (the feast day celebrating the Holy Spirit), the humeral may also have been worn on this particular occasion.\n\nAlthough the Christian religion was not native to China, by the eighteenth century there was some missionary presence there. Embroidered silk vestments and liturgical textiles were made in China, not only to supply the requirements of the churches in China, but also frequently exported to Europe and other new mission posts such as the Philippines. The Guangzhou and Chaozhou regions were particularly renowned for rich gold embroidery on silks and this embroidery may have originated there.",
