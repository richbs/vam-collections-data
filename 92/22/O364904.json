            "physical_description": "Tapestry woven in wool and silk. Long narrow panel divided into four scenes with a border of Renaissance-style ornament based on classical palmette designs. In each corner is a lion mask holding a ring. The four scenes are separated from one another by Corinthian columns. The upper parts of the columns are fluted, and the lower parts are covered with acanthus leaves against which is represented a female figure in classical dress with winged sandals and a winged helmet. Tall ornamental base on a square plinth.\n\nFrom left to right, the scenes are as follows:\n\nThe first scene shows Mars in full armour in a chariot drawn by wolves with the Ram and the Scorpion in the clouds in the centre of the sky. The main scene has a detachment of troops, mounted and on foot, occupying a field over which they are driving the inhabitants. In the background are two detachments engaged with musketry against one another.\n\nThe next scene has Jupiter carrying a thunderbolt and an eagle in a chariot drawn by peacocks in the clouds in the centre of the sky. On the other side are the two signs of the zodiac, the Fish and Sagittarius. The main below is divided into various subjects. On the left is a pope crowning a king or emperor in the foreground, an astronomer busy with an astrolabe and other instruments. In the centre a king is consulting with councillors, and on the right a throned king is receiving a petitioner. In the background in the centre, a man is reading a royal declaration from a balcony to a crowd and over the door underneath the balcony is a date, possibly 1601. In the background on the right is an ecclesiastical procession going to a church and behind is a king on horseback with a canopy over him moving in procession to another church in the distance.\n\nThe third scene has Saturn sitting in a chariot drawn through the clouds in the centre of the sky drawn by griffins, and two small children accompany him. By him are the two signs of the zodiac, Aquarius and Capricorn. The main subject shows peasants on the left reaping and carrying wheat and ploughing. On the right are monks distributing bread and provisions to beggars and disabled people.\n\nThe last scene shows Fortuna. Seated on a globe in the clouds in the centre of the sky is a winged figure holding in its right hand part of its robe in a large curve over its head, and in its left hand is a vase. On the right in the sky is a small figure  holding a psyche and clutching at a child. On the right is a figure of Mercury with a winged helmet holding a purse in one hand, and in the other are various subjects, one of which is a tablet with the date 1591, and underneath are the letters ME [not clear] N. The main scene below has three divisions. On the left is a scene of a disaster with a town on the seashore burning, and in the harbour before it ships are being wrecked. In the centre underneath trees, a party of men and women are singing to music. On the right, men and women are engaged in restoring a ruined city on a seashore and they recover that they can from the ship wrecks in the harbour.",
