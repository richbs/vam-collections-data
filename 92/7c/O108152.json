The steps are on this, the north side, as well as the east and south sides. The scale of the steps is shown by the people climbing up them. The most impressive part of the mosque is the prayer hall on the western side. This is surmounted by minarets and domes which can just be seen in this photograph. The main entrance of the mosque, which was only used by the emperor, is opposite to this on the eastern side. \n\nIn the foreground of the photograph, on the approach to the mosque is a piece of park land with a Mughal building on the left hand side and a street with shops on the right hand side.",

Designed by Ustad Khalil, it was built by the emperor Shah Jahan as part of the city of Shahjahanabad, the seventh of the seven historical cities of Delhi. The building works began in 1650, were completed in 1656 and are said to have required a workforce of 5,000 men. Shah Jahan called it the Masjid-i Jahannuma, or the 'World displaying Mosque'. \n\nThe British photographer Samuel Bourne lived and worked in India between 1862 and 1869. During this time he toured the Himalayas and travelled through the subcontinent, photographing its landscape, architecture and historical sites. He set up a studio in Simla with Charles Shepherd and sold his prints sold to an eager public both in India and Britain.",

The imposing structure is clearly visible from a distance as it is situated on top of a rocky ridge, commonly known as Bhujalal Pahari. \n\nThe mosque is the largest in India and was built by the emperor Shah Jahan as part of the city of Shahjahanabad, the 7th city of the seven historical cities of Delhi. Designed by Ustad Khalil, building began in 1650 and was completed in 1656. It is said that 5000 men worked on its construction. Shah Jahan called it the Masjid-i Jahannuma, or the World displaying Mosque. \n\nVisible in this photograph are the steep high steps leading to the gateway and into the central courtyard of the mosque. The steps are on this, the north side, as well as the east and south sides. The scale of the steps is shown by the people climbing up them. The most impressive part of the mosque is the prayer hall on the western side. This is surmounted by minarets and domes which can just be seen in this photograph. The main entrance of the mosque, which was only used by the emperor, is opposite to this on the eastern side. \n\nIn the foreground of the photograph, on the approach to the mosque is a piece of park land with a Mughal building on the left hand side and a street with shops on the right hand side.",
