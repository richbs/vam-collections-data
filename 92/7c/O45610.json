[Until 1690, Charles, 5th Baron North de Kirtling; until 1734, William, 6th Baron; his wife, Maria Margareta (born \u2018de jonge van Ellemete\u2019). who married secondly in 1735 Patrick Murray, 5th Lord Elibank; his illegitimate son Patrick Murray of Simprim, Forfarshire (d.c.1854); his daughter Maria Margaretta (d.1873) who married in 1842 James, Baron Talbot de Malahide; her eldest daughter Susan-Ann, who married in 1864 Cecil St John Ives, subsequently Major-General; their second daughter Marion who married her third husband in 1923, Godfrey Waiter, 2nd Baron Phillimore; she died in 1950; the miniatures sold to the Museum by private treaty with two of her heirs, 1987.]\n\nWilliam, the elder surviving son of Charles, 5th Baron North (see Cat. No. 131 [P.42-1987]), was born on 22 December 1678, succeeded his father in the barony in 1690, matriculated at Magdalene College, Cambridge, 22 October 1691, and entered the House of Lords in January 1698. He was a soldier, rose to be Lieutenant-General, and fought at Blenheim (1704) where he had a hand shot off. He was a Privy Councillor, Lord Lieutenant of Cambridgeshire and Governor of Portsmouth, but at the death of Queen Anne he opposed the Hanoverian Succession, and was created Earl North in 1722 by 'James III'. In October 1705 he married Maria Margareta, daughter of Cornelius de jonge van Ellemete, by whom he had no children. On his death at Madrid on 31 October 1734, the barony of North de Kirtling, but not his father's barony of Rolleston, passed to his cousin Francis, 3rd Baron Guildford (1704-1790), grandson of Lord Keeper North; Francis was created Earl of Guildford in 1752. This was the line that produced Frederick, 2nd Earl of Guildford (1732-1792), famous by his courtesy title of Lord North as Prime Minister from 1770-82.\u201d",
