The legs terminate in hooved feet. The two sides of the chair are connected by cast iron rods. The chair back has two rods serving as top and bottom rails, between which is a cast-iron pierced lyre-and-scrollwork motif.  Nine closely-spaced rods connect the side-rail sections to create the flat seat. Two rods act as front and back stretchers connecting the legs of the chair.\n\n<b>Structure and materials</b><br>\nCast iron. Casting-lines are visible down the legs and arms. The support rods have been riveted through.\n\n<b>Summary of later interventions/changes</b><br>\nChair has been repainted at least twice. When it was acquired it had been inappropriately repainted white and so it was decided to repaint it matt black as a historically appropriate colour. While black is the likeliest colour this chair could have been originally, it might also have had a painted bronze-effect finish. However, no base-paint evidence was found to indicate the original colour of this chair.",

He also had a professional interest in promoting the royal iron foundries in Berlin and elsewhere. In about 1825 he produced his first designs for cast-iron garden furniture for the gardens of the Prussian royal palaces. \n\nThis chair is based on a design of about 1835 for the R\u00f6mischen B\u00e4der (a garden pavilion known as the Roman Baths) in the gardens at Potsdam.  The design was produced for about thirty years by foundries all over Europe, with slight variations in the detail of the back, arms and feet. Without archival evidence, it is very difficult to date such chairs precisely.", 
            "exhibition_history": "", 
            "bibliography": "Jervis, Simon, Art & Design in Europe and America 1800-1900 (London, 1987)\nThe sophisticated application of neoclassical forms to the design of cast-iron furniture which is demonstrated by this chair is far in advance of anything produced in Britain in the 1820s. It was not until the 1840s that Britain began to produce cast-iron furniture of similar sophistication. Schinkel was also designing a whole range of objects such as urns, candelabra, and tripods in cast iron, both in the neoclassical and Gothic revival styles. Nor did he confine himself to the decorative arts; even before 1820 he had designed his celebrated Kreuzberg war memorial in Berlin. This takes the form of a tall Gothic revival monument reminscent of an 'Eleanor Cross' made completely of iron. It was the established Prussian expertise in casting in iron to a very high standard, as applied to the casting of the well-known fine iron jewellery which Schinkel was exploiting.\n\nDuring the 1820s Schinkel designed a range of iron furniture for use in the parks and gardens of the Prussian Royal Palaces in and around Berlin, including those at Charlottensburg and Potsdam. Chairs and benches to this and similar designs still exist in the gardens of both palaces.\n\nWhen purchased by the Victoria and Albert Museum, this chair - like so much surviving cast-iron furniture - had been incorrectly painted white. Cast-iron furniture in England was painted to imitate bronze or painted to imitate green patinated bronze. In Germany however, as well as these two finishes, matt black was used and much of the Prussian ironware mentioned above, including the jewellery and the Kreuzberg, was finished in this way. Schinkel probably used all three finishes for his iron furniture, but the surviving pieces identical to this chair are black so we have used black in re-painting it.\n\nExamples of this design, although never manufactured in large numbers, were made until the 1860s. This piece is unmmarked and is thus impossible to date precisely.   CW.",

            "history_note": "This garden chair was cast to a design by the architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel, who first produced the design in about 1835 but with a variation in the design of the back panel.\n\nThe design is based on the standard form of chairs at the time, with a high, horizontal back support that curves backwards.  The form of the side pieces, with legs crossing in an x-form, is a classical form. It was a form that Schinkel had used in 1825 for a design for an armchair for the study of the Crown Prince Friedrich Wilhelm (IV) in the Berlin Schloss (see catalogue of an exhibition, <i>Karl Friedrich Schinkel 1781-1841</i>. Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, 1980-1981, cat. 355, p. 228).\n\nSchinkel was extremely interested in industrial processes and the application of art to them. An iron foundry had been established under royal patronage in Gleiwitz in Silesia in 1796 and another in Berlin in 1804. Schinkel, as chief architect of the Department of Building Works of Prussia from 1806, sought to promote the use of cast-iron in buildings in every way possible. After the expulsion of Napoleon in 1815,an extensive building programme started in Berlin, giving him scope to design to this new material. By the mid-19th century cast-iron was one of the most important industries in Prussia. \n\nIn 1826 Schinkel visited France and England and visited many workshops and factories as well as the more usual tourist sites.  He may have seen examples of iron garden furniture in England and it is about the time of his visit that his first designs for such furniture appear, in the form of a bench for the R\u00f6mische B\u00e4der (a garden pavilion known as the Roman Baths) in Potsdam and for the surrounding gardens. These early benches had wooden or marble seats on iron frames. \n\nThis chair, however, is based on Schinkel's most successful model, created in about 1835 for the Roman Baths.  This chair, unlike earlier models, was incorporated into the general production of a number of Prussian foundries and foundries in the Netherlands, Switzerland and Bohemia (see...........).  The details of the back panels might vary but were based on Schinkel motifs such as the lyre and scrolling foliage. The chairback design could be multiplied to produce the design for a bench.  In some of the versions the feet and ends of the arms were simplified into scrolls.\n\nIn this chair design Schinkel had explored the physical properties of cast-iron to create what was a visually (though not physically) light version of an indoor chair.  The side pieces are of I section, lessening their weight while retaining their strength. Unlike the earlier chairs, this has a seat of iron rods, which would allow rainwater to run through.   The history of this model is described by Georg Himmelheber in 'The Beginnings of Cast-iron Garden Furniture Production' in <i>Cast Iron from Central Europe 1800-1850</i>, the catalogue, ed. E. Schmuttermeier, of an exhibition held at the Bard Graduate Center, New Yorkk, 1994, pp. 92-94. \n\nThis chair was purchased by the Museum in 1986 with no prior history (RF 86/1275). At that time it was painted white.  The paint was removed by the Museum and the chair re-painted matt black.  Such garden furniture in England in the 19th century might be painted to imitate bronze or patinated bronze.  In Germany matt black was often used to finish cast-iron.",
