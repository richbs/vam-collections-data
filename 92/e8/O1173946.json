The form and content of the play are reflected in Edward Carrick's designs which show the influence of his father, Edward Gordon Craig. The play was a commercial failure - it was produced at a time of national crisis and the public was not in the mood for plays about the journey through death to Eternity.  Artistically, however, it brought together an extraordinary range of talent: as well as Priestley and Carrick, there was Benjamin Britten, who wrote the music, and Antony Tudor, who choreographed the ballets, while Johnson gave Ralph Richardson one of his greatest stage roles. Associated production: Johnson Over Jordan. Designer: Edward Carrick. Director: Basil Dean. New Theatre, London, 26.2.1939. Performance category: Drama. Production type: World premiere.",
