It was a layered form of cloak, with a shorter matching cape over the shoulders, and was  often elaborately embroidered, or given some other eye-catching trimming such as braid or fur.  Usually treated as 'best' wear, it replaced the magnificent bearing cloths of earlier centuries, and was much easier to put on the child, as well as being within the price range of many more families.   Clothes reformers also suggested capes as being a more suitable form of clothing for an infant when out of doors: they fitted more closely and were often made of warmer fabrics.",
