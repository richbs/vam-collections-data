The marbles were carved by Cornacchini for Cardinal Carlo Agostino Fabroni, who in 1714 invited the sculptor to live in his palace in Rome and provided him with the means to pursue his studies. Cornacchini was to live there for two years. In 1726 the Cardinal donated his library to his native city of Pistoia, and the two marbles followed on his death in 1727. At a later date the terracotta model was provided with an elaborate background including a palm tree and a more developed base in painted plaster, and turned into a representation of the Rest on the Flight into Egypt. These additions were recently removed and a terracotta revealed as the model for the central group of the marble Nativity.",
