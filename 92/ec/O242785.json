As part of the fair, on the second Friday in August, the 'Burry Man' makes his annual perambulation of town boundaries, traditionally to bring luck to the herring fishing fleet. In 1971 the Burry Man was the local grave digger, John Hart, who had performed the ritual for many years. His traditional costume was covered with burrs and roses and he was accompanied by two assistants, collecting money and stopping at all the public houses.\n\nThe photographer Homer Sykes was born in Canada in 1949, but has lived in Britain since 1950. He is one of the UK's foremost documentary photographers and the V&A holds several examples of his work.",
