Usually made of expensive materials - including silver versions of the 1680s engraved with Chinoiserie motifs - they were intended for drinking strong ale or beer in the home. The stoneware mugs of this shape were termed 'gorges', meaning narrow-necked vessels.\n\nMaterial & Making\nJohn Dwight's 'fine white' stonewares attempted to copy the pure whiteness of Chinese porcelain. Paradoxically, however, the surviving examples made at Dehua (Fujian province, China) were clearly copied from Dwight's Fulham products, not the other way around. As mugs for ale or beer, they did not need to be heat-proof. Besides the white, red or brown stonewares, and heavier delftwares, clear and opaque white glass versions are also known.",
