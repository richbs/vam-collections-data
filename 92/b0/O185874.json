            "public_access_description": "This is a campaign poster issued by the German Independent Women's Union for the first and only free parliamentary elections ('Volkskammerwahl') in East Germany (GDR-German Democratic Republic) on the 18th of March 1990. The elections took place between the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and the reunification of East and West Germany.\n\nThe graphic designer Anke Feuchtenberger used a radical design vocabulary for this poster formed out of illustration and comic elements. She engagedl elements originating out of the GDR tradition of poster drawing, which up until then were solely used for poster advertising in a cultural context. Feuchtenberger was the only designer to infuse this design tradition with a political content and the poster goes far beyond the propaganda platitudes of the designers employed by the Social Unity Party (the ruling party in the communist GDR). \n\nThe posters of the Independent Women's Union can be seen as an attenpt to create a stand-alone, new and free kind of political poster for the GDR.\n\nThis poster depicts a Noah's Ark for women, symbolising family welfare. The text states: 'Mit Gef\u00fchl und Verstand und dem Unabh\u00e4nigen Frauenverband', meaning 'With feeling and reason and the Independent Women's Union'.\n\nThe German Independent Women's Union was founded on the 17th of February 1990. The Union was at first a reservoir for different women's movements, with the intention of distancing themselves from the state-directed 'Demokratischer Frauenbund Deutschlands' ('Democratic Women's Federation of Germany'). In September 1991 the Union changed into an association (society), which eventually disbanded in 1998. The political impact of the party remained limited, nevertheless, some of their election posters are of particular importance.",
