The two male figures appear to be musicians though their instruments have been made from household objects such as a pair of bellows. The figure at the front left is dressed in knee-high boots and loose breeches. He wears a three quarter length gown over a plain shirt. His soft cap is trimmed with two feathers and has a soft, wide brim. Behind him stands another male figure dressed in long trousers and wearing a simple tunic fastened with a row of ribbons down its front. A bag is suspended from a belt at his waist. In the background of the image is a veiled female figure dressed an Elizabethan style gown with a long pointed bodice under a long cloak. The skirt of the gown is made from a fabric printed with a motif of foliage and hearts, whilst the low cut, lace trimmed bodice is made from a contrasting fabric with a plain ground and what appear to be bands of braid.",
