Italian goldsmiths were expert at making a little material go a very long way.  Goldsmiths in the south of Italy made lavish use of seed pearls, which were abundant in the warm waters of the Mediterranean before the industrial age.  They attached the seed pearls with thin gold wires.  When these broke, as they frequently did, the pearls were lost.  \n\nAll Italian women wore gold earrings.  Their shapes varied widely in different places.  These earrings come from Santa Lucia, in Naples, but earrings of this type were made and worn throughout southern Italy.  They would originally have had large pendants hanging from the lower edge.\n\nThey were bought as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
