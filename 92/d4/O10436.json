This panel, with the design in point repeat, would have been hung vertically with other panels to form a continuous line of swags. \nStructure: damask woven as 4 & 1 satin, with 2 supplementary pattern wefts in yellow and white. Also some brocading in yellow. The pattern wefts are bound with the satin warp in twill. Proportion of ground to supplementary wefts 2:1.\nSelvedges are intact, with 3 red and 2 yellow stripes, and top edge is hemmed. At the upper end, a narrow separate piece has been sewn on to the main piece with a border of yellow and white stylised flower and leaf shapes. It looks as if it was originally continuous with the main piece, as the pattern either side of the seam nearly matches up. A small band may have been cut out to reduce the height of the panel.",

            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nThis length of silk furnishing fabric has been woven with a pattern simulating a three-dimensional swagged valance. In a clever optical effect the valance appears to be hung with tassels and looped cords, and to be draped over a damask ground.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe pattern in this silk has a mirror repeat, and this panel would have been hung vertically with other panels to form a continuous line of swags. Such a design could have been used for bed hangings, but this piece has traces of glue along its sides and lower edge, indicating it was probably attached to a wall.\n\nPlace\nA previous owner of the silk believed that it was made by Huguenot silk weavers in Ireland. It is almost certainly not Irish because there is no evidence of a silk industry in Ireland in this period which mught have produced a silk of such quality. However, it is also possible that it could be English. However, there are similarly no English silks known of this date, with firm provenance, that are of such high quality, and it is more likely to have been woven in France. Such silks were certainly used in England and Ireland.",
