(see E.12-2011) This poster reproduces one of the other prints from the series and it was made to promote \u2018Weighs Like a Nightmare\u2019, the Historical Materialism 2012 conference held at SOAS, London, 8-11 November.\n\nFor some years now, David Mabb has been engaged in a kind of posthumous collaboration with William Morris, using Morris fabrics and wallpapers as sources of inspiration, and also using them as grounds for paintings or incorporating them into printed works, as here. Mabb\u2019s interest in Morris focuses not only on the design of his patterns but also the inherent contradictions between Morris\u2019s political beliefs \u2013 he was a campaigning Socialist - and his practice as a designer and business-man \u2013 he made his living creating luxury goods that were affordable only by the upper middle-classes. This poster, and the related prints, melds one of Morris\u2019s wallpaper patterns \u2013 here, Honeysuckle, with a geometric motif taken from a Russian Constructivist pattern design. Mabb thus unites and contrasts the craft aesthetic of Morris with the machine aesthetic of Constructivism.",
