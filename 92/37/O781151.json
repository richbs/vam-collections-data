The verticality of the trees and the twisted and sinewy texture of the bark underlines the satyr\u2019s masculinity, in contrast with the soft, pale smoothness of the woman. The darkness of the background gives the impression of a secluded clearing surrounded by dense and ancient woodland.",

ISBN 089835000X. No.69, pp.153-155.\n'D\u00fcrer's friend, Willbald Pirckheimer, undoubtedly suggested the subject of this engraving. It derives from Lucian, some of whose writings Pirckheimer translated. In \"Zeuxis or Antiochus\" it is related that Zeuxis had found that his audience was more attracted by the novelty than by the quality of his paintings. He therefore invented a scene showing a centauress feeding her twin offspring. D\u00fcrer's drawing of this subject in Coburg (SD.1505/16) is evidence that he knew this story. During the 15th and 16th centuries centaurs were often confused with satyrs. D\u00fcrer's satyr plays the platterspiel, a reed instrument equipped with a bladder, similar to a bagpipe. D\u00fcrer's drawing in Basel (SD.1505/17) may have been an early concept for this engraving.\n\nThe forest scene is closely akin to the one of \"Adam and Eve\" (.001). The headgear of the satyr consists once more of birch leaves, emblematic of Pirckheimer [\"the one from Birchville\"]...\n\np.153.\nBartrum, Guilia, ed. <u>Albrecht D\u00fcrer and his Legacy - The Graphic Work of a Renaissance Artist</u> / with contributions by G\u00fcnter Grass, Joseph L.
