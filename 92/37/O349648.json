A memorial to Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftsbury. It was unveiled at Piccadilly Circus, London on 29 June 1893.\nSir Alfred Gilbert (1854-1934) was a famous British sculptor of the late 19th century. He was also medallist, goldsmith and draughtsman. He was known for his inventiveness and characteristically used many different materials in the same work. His many commissions included for example the celebrated figure of Eros, part of the Shaftsbury memorial.\n\nThe commission to produce the memorial had initially been given to Joseph Edgar Boehm, but due to Boehm's other commitments, the commission was passed on to his former pupil Gilbert.",
