There is a tiny stool in front of him.  His left hand clutches a fold of the sanghati. He is  full-faced, with gentle features and his large eyes look far ahead, as though in a dream.  His hair is combed back in soft waves.  Behind the head the little nimbus is encircled by a flowing tree which forms a kind of niche.  On the right and left of the throne stand two princely or divine figures clad in dhotis and dupattas, wearing rich jewellery on their arms, necks and their heads; their posture is reflective and their hands are reverently joined.   They could be gods Brahma and Indra? In the background are four figures, the figure standing in front can be identified as Vajrapani by his thunderbolt. \n\nThey all pray to Buddha to \"turn the wheel of the law\" for the salvation of all beings.",
