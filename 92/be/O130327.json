The mouldings all applied. Technically the methods of construction used appear to be largely authentic, but note that the 'skirting' seems suspiciously thin.\n\nThe four doors supported on pin hinges held by hand-made nails. \nLower doors - panelled, with the upper rail dovetailed into the stiles (an unusual feature), with a large inlayed panel (about 2mm thick) and applied arches (3.5mm thick at its minimum). The base boards meet in a bird's mouth joint and are nailed up.\n\nCondition\nOverall the condition is excellent, but appears much more characteristic of 19th century manufacture than c1600. There is relatively little loss, wear or movement in the wood surfaces, and some surfaces like the cornice feel implausibly sharp (although this is an area that would not have had significant wear.) More significantly the quality of the carving and inlay seems lower, and the carving less vigorous or expressive than expected from good quality woodwork c1600. The lack of comparable German objects c.1600 in our collection make it difficult to judge precisely the wood surfaces and quality of the V&A cupboard (the carved figures for example do not seem convincing in terms of English carving but from photographs they have a lot in common with those illustrated in Kreisel, say.",

The upper half consists of a pediment with carved strapwork frieze and grotesque masks, supported at two front corners by carved female figures.  Below pediment is a cupboard, the front divided into three panels decorated with carving and inlay; at each end and on either side of central panel are pilasters of carytid form.  The two outer panels are doors, the central parts, mounted with carved masks, sliding out-wards to reveal locks.   \nLower half also a cupboard, the two doors decorated with double arcades of raised faceted ornament surrounding panels inlaid with patterns of vases with floral sprays.  At either end and between the doors are pilasters carved with strapwork.  The cupboard is supported on bun feet.   ENGLISH; late 16th century or early 17th century.\nSaid to have been formerly at a house at Arthington, Yorks.\"\n\n13/10/55 NACF Committee\naccepts Clark's gift to the Museum.\n\n1931 Correspondence between Greenwood (W.F.Greenwood & Sons Ltd Antiques, Harrogate) and Brigadier Clark\nincludes many descriptions:\n\n20/7/31 letter Greenwood\nhas \"just bought a most wondeful carved oak inlaid cabinet from Arthington Nunnery.  I think it is one of the most beautiful pieces in England\u2026.6'5\" long\".\n\n30/7/31 letter Greenwood\nencloses a photograph (taken on 31 July 1931) (not attached to letter on file) and writes \"to open the cupboards in the top portion, it is necessary to slide the panels to get at the key hole\u2026\u2026With a strong magnifying glass you can see the wonderful and grotesque expressions given to the various masks etc.   \nThe cabinet is undoubtedly James lst \u2026very rare\u2026.The house out of which this has come is in perfect preservation, being still inhabited\".\n\n7/8/31 letter Greenwood\nrefers to p.27 Fig 13 in Macquoid and Edwards Dictionary of English Furniture where \"there is an illustration of a carved and inlaid bedstead, from Astley Hall, Lancs, with very similar cornice and carved figures, to those on the cabinet, the date of which is circa 1590\u2026..the cabinet is undoubtedly Elizabethan and not James lst.\"\nGreenwood has been able to confirm that the \"Yeadon family have lived in Arthington for 300 years\".  \nIn response to a query by Clark, he explains \"the lower portion of the cabinet forms two doors with positions for shelves in the cupboards.  There are no drawers below, what appears to be drawers are only part of the base with oval patrae in the middle of each.  The whole of the interior living is very beautiful clean dark brown oak\".  A further notation by hand explains \"the upper portion has two cupboards.  There is no inlay, or other ornamentation in the interior\".\n\n31/7/31 Greenwood letter\nencloses a photograph of the house (on file) from which he bought the cabinet \"situated 7 or 8 miles from Harrogate and was founded by Peter de Arthington about 1152\".  Interesting descriptions can be found in \"Lower Wharfedale\" by H Speight and in \"History of Harewood\" by J Jones.\n\n14/8 31 Letter Greenwood\ndescribes John Yeadon as an eccentric - he has been unable to locate him, but has learned that \"the Yeadon family have lived at the Nunnery for the last 150 years but the cabinet has been in their possession for 300 years\u2026..the Nunnery being used as a farm, the house and contents would be taken over at valuation and it is supposed that that is how the ancestors of the present Yeadons came into possession of the cabinet\u2026\"  \nGreenwood awaits the return of John Yeadon for a real and full history.\n17/9/31 Letter Greenwood to Clark\nhe has learnt \"some very interesting particulars\u2026. regarding the cabinet\" from the Earl of Harewood who visited Greenwoods showroom with the Queen on 16 Sept. 1931.  He promises to tell Clark next Tuesday in Harrogate.\n\nOn loan to the Commandery Worcester, January 1977- Jan 2006",

            "historical_context_note": "Although the cupboard may conceivably be German and early 17th century, it seems much more likely that it is a 19th century creation based on north German furniture. It surely cannot be English c1600. More information is needed on the German 19th century trade in antiquarian furniture before judging whether the cupboard was made in Germany or England.\n\nFor commentary on Press cupboards: see Victor Chinnery, Oak Furniture.
