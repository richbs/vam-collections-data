Many were worn hanging from a neckace or neck chain, as elsewhere in Europe, but they were also suspended from the collar and apron chains which are unique to Switzerland.\n\nThe most characteristic element of Swiss traditional jewellery is the lavish use of chains and filigree.  The filigree was often further embellished with coloured stones and enamel.  Shallow faceted black stones, like those on this pendant, are very common in Swiss traditional jewellery, and rarely found elsewhere.  They were originally made of jet, but most are made of very dark red glass, as here.\n\nThis pendant was described as German when it was acquired in 1872, but it is much more likely to be Swiss.",
