It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years. Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nFay Compton played Fanny Gray, 'the lady in spectacles' in C.L. Anthony's play about an inhibited, bespectacled school teacher who falls in love with a handsome inn-keeper whilst holidaying in the Austrian Tyrol. The play was a success in London at the Lyric Theatre where it opened in April 1931 with a cast including Francis Lederer, Martita Hunt, Jessica Tandy, Jack Hawkins and George Zucco. The post-London tour visited Brighton for a week, commencing 28 March 1932, with Fay Compton and Frederick Ranalow in their original roles, the only two London cast members to do the tour.",
