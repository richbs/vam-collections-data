He worked in John Michael Rysbrack's workshop. Cromwell was frequently the subject of sculpture in the eighteenth century in Britian, because he represented an important phase of British constitutional history. Van der Hagen (active London 1744 \u2013  York 1769) worked both in marble and in ivory. He seems to have concentrated in small ivory heads, some after full-size busts by John Michaerl Rysbrack (1694-1770). He was aparaently a native of Antwerp, who practised in London for most of his life. He may be indentical to the monogrammist GVDR.",
