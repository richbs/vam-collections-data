            "historical_context_note": "The sketches, apparently from a sketch-book, were mounted in an album, probably by the artist; subsequently disbound.They were made during Egerton's tour of the Mediterranean and the Holy Land, in company with his wife, Harriet (n\u00e9e Greville), in 1840.  On their return to England she published privately Journal of A Tour In The Holy Land, in May and June, 1840, [published 1841.]  From this most of the sketches can be dated between 28 April (their arrival at Jaffa) and 6 June (an excursion to Baalbek); they arrived in Ancona on their return journey on 17 July.  In 1841 Egerton published Lithographs made from sketches made in Syria by Lord Francis Egerton.",
