            "public_access_description": "This poster advertises the so-called 'Final Masquerade' on 8 September 1842 at Vauxhall Gardens, the London Pleasure Gardens that originally opened in 1661. It advertises equestrian circus acts which did not begin at the gardens until well into the 19th century, as well as dances by 'La Petite Taglioni' including the cachucha and the tarentella.The French equestrienne Mlle. Caroline specialised in getting her horses to be obedient, while the Italian Signor Boltari was called 'the Italian Devil Rider'. The flamboyant engraved lettering for the word 'Masquerade' incorporate the pantomime characters Harlequin, Columbine, Pantaloon and Clown, as well as Shakespearean characters including Hamlet, Macbeth, Shylock and Richard III. \n\nThe printer of this poster William Spencer Johnson  began trading in 1835 from premises in Nassau Street, Soho, and moved to St. Martin's Lane in 1846. He probably made frequent use of these spectacular stock letter forms to attract patrons to go in costume to masquerades, which were regularly held at Vauxhall Gardens on the south bank of the River Thames. Despite this being advertised as Vauxhall's 'final Masquerade', the Gardens did not actually close until 1859 when their 'Last Night Forever' took place on 25 June.",
