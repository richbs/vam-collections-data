The surrealism of the giant ears over the backdrop of space, with a giant clockwork machine as the centrepiece, complements the lyrical and musical content; with the announcement on the poster of the appearance of the mysteriously named \"Azimuth Co-ordinator\"(a quadrophonic sound system), the image of the clockwork box conjures some kind of dystopian machine-run world.\n\nThis concert was entitled The Massed Gadgets of Auximenies - More Furious Madness From Pink Floyd and was a concept show performed for the first time at the Royal Festival Hall. It consisted of improvisations of their early songs over two parts, 'The Man and the Journey', and also a combination of soundtrack material that songwriter Roger Waters had been working on, for the film More, directed by Barbet Schroeder, and other unreleased songs.\n\nThe designers of this poster, two art school student friends of Pink Floyd who would become known as Hipgnosis, were asked to create the cover of their second album, A Saucerful of Secrets. Their style was in surreal, elaborately manipulated photography and collage, a form of what today would be classed as 'photoshopping'. Following this they received further work from other artists on EMI, but got their big break when Floyd released Dark Side of the Moon. The design they created, a refracting prism set against a black background, is now one of popular music's most iconic album covers.",
