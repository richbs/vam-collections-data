A rectangular box for an ancestral tablet, with removeable sliding front, set on a low pedestal carved with lotus panels. The interior and underside of the flat base are lacquered plain black.\nThe decoration is executed in carved red lacquer, carved down to reveal a yellow ground cut with a cash-diaper. on the top is a  single confronting dragon among clounds, on each side is a single rising dragon among clouds. On the back are two rising dragons among clouds, one each side of the cartouche containing the inscription. All dragons have five claws. \nThe sliding front is carved with an assembly of Buddhist divinities, presided over by Sakyamuni at the top. There are in effect four tiers to this decoration, which includes Maitreya and Amitabha, the Eight Manifestations of Guanyin, Heavenly Kings, Boddhisattvas and Lohans.\nINSCRIPTION: In raised red characters on a plain red cartouche,'Da Qing Qian Long Nian Jing Zhi'( Reverently made in the Qianlong period of the Great Qing).\nCOMPARE: A closely comparable box, from which the inscription had been ground away, was in the possession of Spink and Son Ltd. in 1983.\nDISCUSSION: There are no grounds for sustaining Jenyns and Watson's conclusion that this box contained the spirit tablet of the Qianlong emperor, a conclusion based on their misreading of the inscription. The known existence of a pair makes it likely that the box's origins lie in a temple patronised by the court, and may have been one of a large set. The Buddhist scene is definitely in a court Lamaist taste. The quality of the lacquer carving is very fine.",

The iconography of the type of Buddhism practised in these areas, called Lamaism, also deeply influenced court art. This lacquer box, produced at the court lacquer workshop and bearing an inscription referring to the Qianlong emperor (1736-1795), is decorated with five-clawed dragons and a number of Buddhist deities. It was probably intended for a spirit tablet, bearing the name of a deceased or minor deity, for which a rite was performed. The iconography on the cover clearly indicates that this box was used in a Buddhist context.",
