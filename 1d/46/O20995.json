Such dishes were used mainly as display objects, which often ensured their survival in as-new condition.\n\nPeople\n Rarely can delftware be attributed to individual potters or painters. In this case, however, the distinctive drawing style can be  linked to other surviving dishes, one of which bears the initials 'RI' on the back which have plausibly been identified with Richard Irons, a  Southwark potter who was buried in 1664. During the 17th Century, Southwark was both the centre of the London delftware industry and an enclave of Dutch craftsmen in general. It is not known, however, which of the two major potteries (Pickleherring or Montague Close) Richard Irons may have worked for.\n\nDesign & Designing\nDutch prints were usually chosen as sources of decoration by the Dutch potting fraternity in Southwark. This particular print, which must originally have formed part of a set of the Five Senses, has not yet been identified.",
