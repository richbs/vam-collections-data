It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years. Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn\u2019t needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nActor-manager Sir John Martin Harvey performed with Sir Henry Irving\u2019s company at the Lyceum Theatre for fourteen years and later played some of Irving's great roles including Mathias in The Bells. He made his first stage appearance in 1881 and was one of the last direct links with Irving and the traditions of the Victorian theatre. He inaugurated his own management of the Lyceum Theatre in 1899 with a production of The Only Way in which he played Sydney Carton, a part with which he was associated for the rest of his life. He played Jonathan Perigo, the grocer who returns to earth from heaven for a day, in the original production of Beyond at the Savoy in September 1933 when it went under the title If Only Father -.  During the week in Brighton Martin Harvey's company presented four different plays, A Cigarette Maker's Romance, The King's Messenger and The Bells, as well as Beyond.",
