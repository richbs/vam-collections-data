The long hair is parted in the centre and a plait (or perhaps wreath) is coiled around the head; this classical hairstyle, the oval face and Roman nose led to the work being considered antique when it was first acquired by the Museum. However it is not Roman, but more probably an imitation of the antique made in the eighteenth century Two pairs of small holes drilled into the back of the neck suggest that it was originally supported on a pedestal. Although there are no exact stylistic parallels, small amber busts occasionally featured in Kunstkammer collections. The brooch is contained in a purpose made leather box printed with the names of the Jewellers Longman and Strong, suggesting that the pin was almost certainly made by them and therefore dates from between 1910 and 1922.",
