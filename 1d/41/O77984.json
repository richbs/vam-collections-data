Staffordshire potters made green and gold tea-wares like this for both the home market and export.\n\nMarketing\nThe Staffordshire potter Josiah Wedgwood (1730-1795) was probably referring to wares of this type in 1766 when he told his business partner that he was sending him cargo for export, including 'green and Gold for hot Climates'. Later that same year he wrote again about these wares: 'Pray sell all the green and gold for Pensecola, the new discover'd Islands [the West Indies], or where you can, for I will never take it again, so make your best of it'. He added, 'I have been quite clearing my Wareho[use] of Colour'd ware, am heartily sick of the commodity ... Green desert ware is often wanted, in reality for the West India Islands. I have a few crates on hand, some gilt, some plain ...'. This suggests that Wedgwood may have been making green and gold teawares for export to the West Indies, but that he was also offloading stocks that had ceased to be fashionable in Britain.",
