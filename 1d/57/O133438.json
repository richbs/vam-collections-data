It is engraved on a circular gold panel at one end with the name 'Clement' and at the other with Irving's signature and the date 10 November 1892.\n\nClement William Scott (1841-1904) was a theatre critic who began his career as a clerk in the War Office but went on to become one of the leading theatre critics of the 19th century. He was a great friend and champion of Henry Irving for whom he edited the journal The Theatre from 1880 until 1889.  In March 1892 Clement Scott was finally elected as a member of the prestigious theatrical establishment The Garrick Club, but since this is engraved with the date of the opening night of Irving's production of King Lear, this may have been the present Irving gave gentlemen guests at the first night dinner.  It was later owned by the theatre owner and plywright Walter Melville and may have been given to him after Scott's death.",
