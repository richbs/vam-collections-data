The design is labelled 'Rosalind, 1st Dress (Miss Athene Seyler), Act 1, Scene 2'.\n\nClaud Lovat Fraser (1890-1921) was an artist and designer. After a brief period spent training at the Westminster School of Art, he decided to develop his imaginative style independently and set up his own studio in London. He associated with leading figures in art, literature, and theatre. Amongst them the painters Albert Rutherston and Paul Nash and designer Edward Gordon Craig, who recruited Lovat Fraser to the committee of the Society of Theatre. \n\nDespite poor health Lovat Fraser was commissioned in the army in 1914 but he was invalided home in 1916 to work on visual propaganda and army records. Having been demobbed in 1919, he held a successful exhibition that September at London's Mansard Gallery, featuring designs for settings and costumes for As You Like It and La serva padrona, executed for productions by Nigel Playfair at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith. Lovat Fraser was one of the first designers to turn his attention to designing for a small stage, and his witty and innovative designs for The Beggar's Opera at the Lyric in 1920 were considered by James Laver 'to have inaugurated a new era in stage design' (Oxford Companion to the Theatre, 4th edn, p.305). From 1920 onwards he produced innumerable theatre designs, textile designs and book illustrations, before continued ill health lead to his early death in 1921. \n\nAthene Seyler (1889-1990) was a British comedy actress. Having won a gold medal at RADA in 1908 she went on to make her name in various Restoration comedies produced by Sir Nigel Playfair at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith in the 1920s. Later, she became well known for her appearances in the plays of Congreve, Wilde, Wycherley, and Sheridan. She was made a CBE in 1959.",
