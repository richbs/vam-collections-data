            "physical_description": "*1-332. paper sheets. There are 332 fortunes written on machine made paper; coloured cream; blue; green; yellow and pink (now faded and slightly discoloured). The paper is very thin but not tissue weight; each sheet is tear shaped with a scalloped lower edge. The bottom part is folded up and the closed shape is triangular with a curved outer edge. Damage has occurred to the outer edges and the fold lines. Each sheet has a small hole at the top through which passed a thread; sewing it to the body of the doll. The fortunes themselves are written in French and are all about 'love' which suggests that they were designed for young girls and unmarried ladies rather than children. \n*A translated example of a fortune is -\nRemember life is an express train and you only get 10 minutes at the buffet of love. \nThe sheets are supported on a faded pink cardboard cone which forms\na skirt over the doll's lower body and extends below the legs. The cone is tied at the waist line over part of the cotton wool and its length is fastened on the left side by long stitches over what may be metal pins (sharp ends protrude inside). The cone is crushed and the lower edge folded up about \u00bdin. This is due to the weight being taken on the cone and fortunes when the whole should have been supported. \n*Paper Conservation have removed the sheets from the doll and each numbered from 1 to 332. Following conservation all but one sheet will be reattached to the doll; the remaining sheet will be used to show the design of the 'fortune' as the replaced ones will not be usable. A supporting stand will be constructed to hold the doll; both for display and storage. \n*It may be that the doll and the fortunes were supported in a frame by the protruding nail through the body. The whole would spin and when the fortunes were uppermost they would flounce outwards allowing one to be selected and read without harming the rest. This procedure would account for the use of the doll's legs. \n333. doll \n334. Originally the doll also wore a red jacket of dark red velvet with tarnished gold trim. This was mislaid while being photographed in the V&A; 11/02/1993.  A replacement jacket; if original is not found; will be made by Textile Conservation. There are a number of Conservation reports and work on the paper parts in particular will be undertaken during 1994. A registered packet will be prepared of these reports.",
