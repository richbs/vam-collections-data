The original watercolour design for this textile is in the collection of the City Museum and Art Gallery, Birmingham. It took some years to put this pattern into commercial production.  \n\nOriginally Morris commissioned Thomas Clarkson of Bannister Hall, one of the leading manufacturers of printed textiles, to print this design as he had no means to do it himself. They used chemical, aniline dyestuffs, which were widely used in practice at the time.  Morris was unhappy with the crude effects of the bright blue used.  \n\nIn 1875 he spent time with Thomas Wardle at his print works in  Leek, Staffordshire, experimenting with natural dyes. It is likely that this pattern was attempted then. A letter from Morris to Wardle at the time complains yet again about the blue dyes, claiming that 'they wash even worse than Clarkson's blues; in fact worse that any I have ever seen and it would be useless to sell them in the present state.' Morris then abandoned all attempts to produce the pattern until 1883, when it was  successfully achieved by the indigo discharge method in his own factory at Merton Abbey, Wimbledon.",
