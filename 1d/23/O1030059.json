            "bibliography": "Timmers, Margaret (ed), <i>Impressions of the Twentieth Century: Fine Art Prints from the V&A's Collection</i>, London, V&A Publications, 2001\nThe full text of the entry is as follows: \n\n\"<b>Hamish Fulton (born 1946)</b> \n\n<i>Humming Heart</i>, 1983 \n\nHamish Fulton, like his contemporary Richard Long, has focused his creative energies on walking.  He has written: 'My artform is the short journey - made by walking in the landscape.'  Unlike Long, he makes no deliberate interventions in the landscape.  He takes photographs in the course of a walk or produces a text describing the walk, and his accompanying observations and emotions.  His art celebrates and continues the nomadic tradition, an intimate physical but non-possessive relationship with the land.  The journey itself is a kind of meditation, a way of freeing himself from 'urban thinking' and making contact with other levels of perception through a direct experience of a landscape and the elements.  Every work is a response to a specific walk.  <i>Humming Heart</i> is a three-part work about a walk in Nepal, and the three images are intended to commemorate the journey in all its dimensions.  The circular images, which suggest the lens of a camera or telescope, present the distant view, the foreground and the detail; the last - a single footprint - is an apparent reference to Fulton's belief that 'the only things you should leave [in the landscape] are footprints' and that only photographs should be taken away.  As in Richard Long's print, the footprint is a simple emblem for the making of the work as a whole.  The texts that form part of the work, as both captions and content, are characterized by a poetic economy - precise and simple, yet ambiguous and evocative.  Though it draws on a specific personal experience, <i>Humming Heart</i> also acknowledges Nepal's wider reputation as a place of spiritual pilgrimage. \nThe sepia-toned photogravure prints are self-consciously anachronistic - photogravure is an ink-printing process popular in the late nineteenth-century.  Then its chief commercial use was for art publishing, but it was also favoured by the pictorial photographers of the period, such as P. H. Emerson, for its 'subtlety and delicacy'.  In the twentieth century photogravure has often been adopted by artists, like Fulton, who use photographic imagery but would not call themselves photographers.  For Fulton the photograph is simply a record, not only of the place itself but also of his mood and the experience of the walk.  He has said: 'I don't use a photograph unless when I took it I was feeling clear and good.'  In other words the moment of taking the photograph is more important than any technical proficiency of the quality of the negative produced.  In this case the photogravure process enhances the prints, but also links Fulton to the nineteenth-century peripatetic photographers and the opening up of the Far East to Western travellers.\"",
