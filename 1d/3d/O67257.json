            "physical_description": "Carpet of hand-knotted woollen pile on woollen warp and weft. The design consists of a central dark red ground with three large hexagonal medallions in a central row. Each medallion has a blue ground with a central rosette from which a large tulip on a white stem protrudes from either side, and elsewhere on red stems are stylised carnations, rosebuds and hyacinths. The outline of the hexagons are decorated with hooks, red on the inside and blue on the outside, with a narrow band of dark purple and white blocks between. Two and two half small red octagons overlie and link the medallions. From these, flowers similar to those in the medallions, protrude into the field. The main border consists of a yellow ground with rosettes in various colours on a central dark red stem, and are separated by two pairs of dark red leaves. The inner border consists of a brown ground with S-motifs in dark red and light blue. The outer border consists of a dark red ground with S-motifs in white and brown.\n\nWARP: white wool, Z2S, and 13 threads per inch (56 per dm)\n\nWEFT: red wool; Z-spun, unplied; 2 shoots after each row of knots; 11 knots per inch (42 per dm)\n\nPILE: wool; 9 colours: dark red, red, yellow, light green, blue, light blue, dark purple, dark brown, white; symmetrical knot tied around 2 threads; 71 knots per square inch (1176 per sq dm)\n\nSIDE FINISH: 2 cords overcast, on the right hand side with light red wool and on the left with red wool\n\nEND FINISH: Missing but re-warped at both ends with white cotton (Z4S) to form 2 inches (1 cms) of plain weave secured by one row of weft twining to form a fringe.",
