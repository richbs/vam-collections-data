Most importantly of all, Oliver introduced a new concept to England: that drawing could be a dynamic, spontaneous activity, ideally suited to the jotting down of quick visual notes, rather than, as his master Hilliard had used it, a tool whose use was limited to the setting out of a composition\u2019s basic contours. However, although his lively drawings have the air of having been made directly from the life, they are mostly based on existing visual sources.",
