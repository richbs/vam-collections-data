In the late 1960s, sometimes with Nigel Waymouth as Hapshash and the Coloured Coat, he created psychedelic posters for many of the English bands of the time, and decorated and advertised Nigel Waymouth's King's Road boutique, Granny Takes a Trip. He also designed for concerts held at the UFO club and Saville Theatre, and for underground magazine Oz. Their influences came from the decorative and eroticised designs of Art Nouveau, combined with the melting rainbow colours of LSD visions and pop art inspirations from the post-war media; traces of Disney, horror movie monsters and comic book characters and can often be seen  hiding amongst the images.\n\nThe International Times was an underground paper founded in London in 1966. Launched at The Roundhouse at a gig featuring Pink Floyd, the event was described as a \"Pop/Op/Costume/Masque/Fantasy-Loon/Blowout/Drag Ball\". David Allen of Soft Machine, who performed at the launch, described it as \"one of the two most revolutionary events in the history of English alternative music and thinking. The IT event was important because it marked the first recognition of a rapidly spreading socio-cultural revolution that had its parallel in the States\".\n\nThroughout 1967 it was often raided by the police, allegedly in order to force it out of business and was shut down for the first time in 1972, for running contact advertisments for gay men.",
