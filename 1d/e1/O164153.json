A kneeling putto carved in ivory acts as the knop to the lid. These figures are reminiscent of the work of Francois Du Quesnoy (1597-1643).  The inner silver lining of the tankard is gilt. The elaborate silver gilt mounts forming the handle and decorative borders of the ivory drum are marked IL, on the upper rim and under the base, probably the initials of Joanas Laminit, who was active in Augsburg. Three marks for the city of Augsburg are visible on the upper and lower rims and under the base, as well as a Dutch import mark on the lower rim, dating from the nineteenth century. The style of the whole suggests it was made in Augsburg in the mid to late seventeenth century.",
