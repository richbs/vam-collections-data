The central symbol, a circle with a cross suspended below is the symbol for 'woman'.  The poster was displayed at big, one-day conferences for women all over Europe, next to a poster specific to the individual country by a woman artist from that country. The theme of all these accompanying posters was ' Half the Heaven, Half the Earth, Half the Power'. Lolli Aboutboul herself found and selected the artists to design these posters.",
