Soldiers were separated from their families and friends and the emphasis on the joy and goodness of Christmas became all the more pronounced. Many wartime greetings cards focused on warm scenes of hearth and home of the kind they would be missing. This quaint domestic scene featuring the family cat by the fireside typifies cards of this era. These same scenes were just as nostalgic for the wives, children and elderly coping with loneliness and the discomforts of rationing at home.",
