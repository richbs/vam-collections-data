Several similar examples exist, including those in the Horne Foundation and the Bigallo in Florence. All are derived from the head of Christ in the bronze group of 'Christ and St. Thomas' executed between 1466 and 1483 for the niche on Orsanmichele in Florence (now in the Museo Orsanmichele) by Andrea De Verrocchio (1435-1488). They were doubtless produced by several workshops, including Verrocchio's, and by Giovanni della Robbia in unglazed terracotta. The terracotta would originally have been painted.",

Several similar examples exist, including those in the Horne Foundation and the Bigallo in Florence. All are derived from the head of Christ in the bronze group of 'Christ and St. Thomas' executed between 1466 and 1483 for the niche on Orsanmichele in Florence (now in the Museo Orsanmichele) by Andrea De Verrocchio (1435-1488). They were doubtless produced by several workshops, including Verrocchio's, and by Giovanni della Robbia in unglazed terracotta. The terracotta would originally have been painted.\nPurchased in London",
