Kyogen theatre is a humorous counterpart to Noh drama, and this mask would have been used in plays such as Ebisu-Bishamon. The features are extremely expressive, with the smiling deity creasing his face in laughter. The face is fuller than other examples of masks of this character. The eyes are comma-shaped, with laugh-lines reaching towards the ears. The nose is full, with wide flaring nostrils; the mouth is fully open, revealing the upper set of deeply carved teeth; and the cheeks are full and express the jolly nature of the god. The ears are long and pendulous (although traditionally Ebisu is deaf), and have developed a patina from handling and wear. There are two paper-covered textile pads fixed to the top interior of the mask so that the eye-holes are angled downwards. This enabled the performer to see better and at the same time make the mask more comfortable to wear. It is likely that with the mask in this unusual position the performer would be able to see through the nose-holes rather than through those for the eyes. The two cord-holes in the upper part of the ears show signs of use, and the exterior's painted surface is also well worn.",
