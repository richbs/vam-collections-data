Although made of oak it is still relatively light due to its thin legs, and because the marble surface used for the make-up, brushes and toiletries, or for resting a wash-basin, is relatively small. \n\nIt has a drawer compartment under the adjustable mirror, and another compartment under the marble slab which stored make-up and toiletries. Towels could be hung on the metal rails on either side. Because of its height, and the fact that the mirror can be raised, it appears that this was designed to be used while the actor was standing up.  Given the basic nature of many theatre dressing-rooms in the early 19th century, a portable stand like this would have been very useful, as an actor could move to the best position for light.",
