The central, deep band is of six-sides, linked and hooked motifs; bands 2 and 6 have a red ground with a continuous blue, angular motif on a central stem, all infilled with small crosses; bands 1,3,5, and 7 have a yellow ground with a zigzag pattern in various colours.  All these bands are separated by narrow bands of solid colour and by narrow bands of adjacent squares.\n\nCatalogue date: 27.3.91",
