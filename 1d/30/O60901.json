To the left of the peacock are two royal figures, possibly King Thibaw and Queen Supayalat, under umbrellas, and attended on their left (proper) are Burmese subjects, and on their right (proper) are British soldiers. To the right of the peacock is a group of British and Indian soldiers (including two mounted officers) being led towards the palace by a Burmese. Above the peacock is the party of British and Indian soldiers being received by Burmese ministers, some of whom are seated in a pavilion.",

On each of the four sides, facing outwards, are scenes possibly relating to the exile of King Thibaw and Queen Supayalat after the British annexation of Mandalay in 1885. The scene below the peacock shows a palace with two royal figures seated in a forecourt, receiving homage from courtiers and ministers; to the left of the peacock are two royal figures attended by Burmese subjects on their left and British soldiers on their right; to the right of the peacock a group of British and Indian soldiers are shown being led towards the palace by a Burmese; and above the peacock British and Indian soldiers are being received by Burmese ministers.",
