Responding to specific locations in the Museum, the architects explored themes such as study, work, play, performance and contemplation. Seven of the proposals were then selected for construction at full-scale.\n\nThese projects promoted an attitude to architecture where to 'dwell' meant something more than simply to find shelter. Each building invited the participation of the viewer. These immersive environments reawakened people's ability to inhabit architectural space on both a physical and an emotional level.\n\nThis structure is intended for the V&A's Cast Courts. Its inhabitant would be connected live to a number of visitors wandering around the Museum, using wireless cameras and microphones. In the same way as architectural plaster casts allow us to replicate and transport a 'built moment' through time and space, this project would allow us to reproduce parallel visitor experiences and insert them into the mind of an individual, detached observer.",
