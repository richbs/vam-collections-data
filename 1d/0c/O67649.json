            "public_access_description": "A punch bowl is a large circular bowl, originally intended for serving punch and later iced beverages or egg-nog. Punch is a beverage, varying in composition but usually having a base of wine or distilled spirit, together with other ingredients such as milk, water, sugar, spices and fruit juice and usually served hot. The term punch is derived from the Hindi word for five, \u2018pac\u2019, in reference to the five ingredients used originally in India.\n\nThis bowl, of Sheffield plate, is decorated with eight rectangular relief stampings: four with a single figure of a Bacchante in each; two depicting a contest between Greeks and Amazons; and two showing the death of Penthesilia.\n\nSheffield plate originated, with the discovery in 1742, that bars of silver and copper, in unequal proportions, fused by heating under pressure, could be rolled into sheets of laminated metal and worked like silver. The industry this material created flourished for about 100 years until superseded by electroplating in the 1840s.",
