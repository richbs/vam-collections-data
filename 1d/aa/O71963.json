Tschudi was one of his best pupils. Her work was better appreciated in Britain than in Switzerland and was included in several exhibitions. In 1933 Ice Hockey was singled out for praise by The Times newspaper art critic and others when shown at the Ward Gallery in London. Impressions were purchased by the V&A and the British Museum within a few weeks of the show, and when the exhibition travelled through the UK and Canada (1933-1936), requests were received for more impressions.",

            "bibliography": "Timmers, Margaret (ed), <i>Impressions of the Twentieth Century: Fine Art Prints from the V&A's Collection</i>, London, V&A Publications, 2001\nThe full text of the entry is as follows: \n\n\"<b>Lill Tschudi (born 1911)</b> \n\n<i>Ice Hockey</i>, 1933 \n\nThe rise of colour linocuts in the 1920s and 1930s stemmed from the work of Claude Flight, a tutor at the Grosvenor School of Modern Art, London, and an energetic proselytiser for the medium through exhibitions and his  own writings.  One of his most promising pupils was Lill Tschudi, whose work he particularly promoted. \nAlthough a few individual artists had used lino as a printing medium earlier in the century, it had not been widely adopted, largely because it was stigmatized as a children's art material.  To Flight, writing in 1934, this meant that 'the linocut is different to the other printing mediums, it has no tradition of technique behind it, so that the student can go forward without thinking of what Bewick or Rembrandt did before...he can do his share in building up a new and more vital art of tomorrow.'  His students really embraced this challenge, not just through their technical use of the medium, such as superimposing colours and avoiding the key block of traditional colour printing, but also through the subjects they depicted, which were chosen to emphasize the speed and vitality of the everyday world. \nLill Tschudi was Swiss and studied with Claude Flight only for a short period in 1929, though she kept in close touch through correspondence and annual reunions.  Because of Flight's exhibitions of her work, however, she became better known in Britain than in her native Switzerland.  <i>The Times</i> critic of the fourth exhibition of British Linocuts organized by Flight at the Ward Gallery, London, in 1933 wrote that 'one of the most successful exhibitors is names Miss Lill Tchudi [<i>sic</i>].  Her \"Ice Hockey\", in black, green, grey and white, strikes us as exactly what the lino-cut ought to be...' \nAlthough the work of Flight and his pupils has certain similarities, Tschudi's output is distinct in various ways.  Her subject matter often related to life in Switzerland and France - in this case, Swiss winter sports.  She was also very interested in life drawing: in <i>Ice Hockey</i> the characteristic stances of the hockey players are skillfully captured, despite being broken down into simplified shapes that fill the picture space.  Here speed is conveyed by the circular composition, which apparently focuses on the unseen chuck at its centre.  Movement is conveyed by the rhythmic lines of the skates' incisions in the ice.  This print was widely praised and was bought by the V&A and British Museum within a few weeks of its exhibition at the Redfern Gallery, also in 1933.  In fact, during this exhibition (which toured around the UK and Canada from 1933 to 1936) the artist was requested to send more impressions, which she then individually hand-printed. \nAfter 1939 - by which time linocut exhibitions were no longer popular - Tschudi's work started to become more abstract: she wrote to Flight that as a result of the war she felt she was no longer able to depict humanity with optimism and that pure abstraction was the only way left to her.\"",
