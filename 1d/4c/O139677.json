            "public_access_description": "The parasol was a popular accessory during the 19th and early 20th century, a period when sun tanned skin was highly undesirable. It functioned both as a sunshade and a fashionable accompaniment to dress, distinguishing itself from the umbrella through its infinite and luxurious forms and essentially feminine status. Like the earlier trend for fans parasols displayed an individual's style and could be used in a coquettish ritual to hide the modest bearer from unwanted glances.\n\nBefore the sobering effects of the outbreak of war in 1914, parasol styles changed with every season, the only constants being a standard length of stick (44inches), and matching your sunshade to your dress in colour and trimmings. This en-tout-cas (all weather parasol) follows the convention for this period with its elaborate and costly handle and plain cover with no trimmings. The horn handle, intricately carved into the shape of three dogs, is a pre-cursor to the canine trend in parasols of the early 20s.  The fine line between an en-tout-cas and a parasol depended on the waterproofing of the silk.",

Broughton died before he could be elevated to a peerage, their eldest son Urban H.R. Broughton (1896-1966) became 1st Baron Fairhaven of Lode on 20 March 1929, while Cara became 1st Lady Fairhaven. This barony became extinct on Urban H.R.Broughton's death, but a later barony, Baron Fairhaven of Anglesey Abbey, co. Cambridge, was granted to him in 1961, with a remainder to his brother, Henry (1900-1973), to enable this title to continue after his death without male heirs.\n\nThis forms part of a large donation of late 19th and early 20th century garments and accessories (with a few historical textiles) donated to the Museum in 1972 by Cara's grandson and Henry's son, Major Ailwyn Broughton and his wife, a year before Ailwyn became Lord Fairhaven following his father's death.",
