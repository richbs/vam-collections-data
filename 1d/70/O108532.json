The success of a set design cannot be judged until it is translated into three dimensions by the set painters or builders.  Some designers build their own set models, others are realised by specialist model makers or set builders.  \nIt is often difficult from a set drawing to see how the design will be realised.  This design is for a ballet and so requires as much stage space as possible to allow for the movement and would have been executed as a two dimensional backcloth with side wings.  It perfectly creates the mood for the 19th century romantic story of a poet who falls in love with a beautiful sleepwalker and who, in true Gothic tradition, is killed by a jealous rival.",
