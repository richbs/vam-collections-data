It was initially conceived as a comic opera, but was rejected as such in 1772 by the Com\u00e9die Italienne. The play as it is now known was written in 1773, but, due to the legal and political problems of the author, it was not performed until 23rd February, 1775, at the Com\u00e9die Fran\u00e7aise in the Tuileries. It is the first play in a trilogy of which the other parts are The Marriage of Figaro and The Guilty Mother.\n\nThis design appears to be part of a series of prints published by Martinet, Rue du Coq, of which this example is labelled as number 99. It is part of the Harry Beard Collection.",
