Wound around the central post is a length of heavy string; knotted into a loop at the end.  In the centre of the green side is the maker's stamp and in the centre of the red side has been carved the initials of the owner.\n\n*The yo-yo has one of the longest toy histories, however, each individual yo-yo tends to have a very short life span.  Children play with them usually for only a year or two between the ages of 6 and 10.  As toys, the yo-yo is cheaply produced and intended for a short life and few survive being played with.  This example is from about 1936 when the yo-yo was a very popular toy.  It is in extremely good condition with the paintwork intact and the original string unbroken.  \n\nThe Cheerio Yo-Yo was patented in Canada in the 1930s by the Kitchener Buttons Company of Ontario and produced in a variety of sizes and colours for more than 30 years.  It was exported internationally and was, during the 1930s, the best seller in Great Britain.",
