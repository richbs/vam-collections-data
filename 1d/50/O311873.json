Coats.\n\nHistorical significance: In 1865 the Art Union decided to commemorate David Roberts, and the medal was commissioned to George T. Morgan in 1873, around the time he worked for Pinches in London. The thirty silver medals were allotted in 1875.  Beaulah notes: \u2018It is a matter of interest that of the thirty winners eight were residents overseas \u2013 an indication of the Art Union\u2019s wide field\u2019 (Beaulah, 1967, 184).  Morgan was to produce the Art Union medal to David Cox in 1879, and he would later pursue his career as assistant mint-engraver in the United States.\nDavid Roberts RA (1796-1864) was a Scottish painter specialised in architectural subjects and genre scenes set in Egypt and the Near-East, where he travelled in 1838-1840. On his return Roberts worked with lithographer Louis Haghe from 1842 to 1849 to produce the plates of the <u>Sketches in the Holy Land and Syria, 1842-1849</u> and <u>Egypt & Nubia</u> series, made from his drawing and watercolour travel sketches.  The reverse of the present medal is taken from his <i>Letter Writer, Cairo</i> illustrated in the latter series. The subject matter, d\u00e9cor, figures (scribe in turban and veiled woman), oriental props (hookah) are typical of the Orientalist genre scenes that were fashionable at the time and granted Roberts a considerable success.",

            "historical_context_note": "The Art Union of London (1837- 1912) sought to promote public interest in the arts and encourage British artists and manufacturers of decorative arts.  For a subscription of one guinea per year, members of the society received an engraving and were entered into a yearly draw. \nA 'medallic series of the History of British Art' was planned by the society in 1842, although the first medal was only produced four years later, by William Wyon, chief engraver at the Royal Mint (Beaulah, 1967,180). In addition to commemorating famous British artists, the series aimed at reviving interest in medal-making and encourage British die-engravers. Each year, thirty silver medals were given to subscribers that did not qualify for the highest prize in the draw. Bronze medals were given to subscribers who might prefer one to the annual engraving although relatively few decided to take the medal (Beaulah, 1967,179).\nThirty medals were issued between 1846 and 1887, of which twenty-nine commemorate British artists. The last medal was commissioned to Alfred Gilbert., to mark the golden jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1887. Fifteen painters, seven sculptors, six architects and one die-engraver (Wyon) were commemorated. The medals' obverses show their portrait busts (generally in profile), while the subjects of the reverses are borrowed from the celebrated artists and significant examples of their work. Twelve of these medals were issued within a decade of subject's deaths 'the rest were in honour of figures such as Wren, Hogarth, etc., whose reputations had already stood the test of time' (Beaulah, 1967,181). \nThanks to ample funds, the society was able to commission from the best die engravers, as the aim of the series was to promote 'dignified simplicity of composition \u2026 clam expression\u2026 purity and correctness of drawing, and severe beauty of form' ((Beaulah, 1967, 180-181). \n\nOther public collections in which this medal is held: Ashmolean Museum, Oxford; British Museum, London; Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge; National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland, Edinburgh; Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh.",
