Full citation: \n\n\"<b>Unknown Woman</b>\n<b>1650-60</b>\nEvans 12\n<b>Oval 34 x 27 mm\n</b>\nFeatures softly hatched and stippled in brown and sanguine, with some blue-green shadow hatched around the chin, jaw and under the eyes, on a pale carnation ground; hair in brown wash, hatched in darker colour and heightened with grey; cap in dark grey wash hatched in black; collar in washes of grey and white with thick white heightening; dress in dark grey wash hatched in black; background a brown wash; a gold marginal strip; on vellum put down on pasteboard. \n\n<b>Condition:</b> Marginal abrasions and minor rubbing over the surface. \n\n<b>Signed:</b> Not signed. \n\n<b>Frame:</b> A silver-gilt locket, possibly original; the hanger removed; set in a turned oval frame of ebonised mahogany. \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> Alan Evans, by whom bequeathed to the National Gallery, 1974; placed on indeterminate loan at the V&A (see Appendix 3). The miniature was not part of the Wallop Loan, and may have been part of Alan Evans's own small initial collection which, though concentrating on the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, seems to have included some earlier works. \n\n<b>Literature:</b> <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 78 (Anon., Anglo-Netherlandish, mid-seventeenth century). The miniature was listed in the 1969 Christie's valuation of the Evans Collection as by John Hoskins, but this attribution was rejected verbally or in MS notes by every subsequent commentator. Although difficult to date on costume and coiffure, it seems to be of the 1650s. Technically, it is compatible with English practice, and the work is of very high quality. Together with the suggestion that the artist (and the Sitter) might be Dutch or have Dutch connections, attributions to Des Granges and Alexander Cooper have been put forward. \n\nThe case for Des Granges would rest on comparison with portraits such as the <i>Charles II</i> (Cat. No. 50) and the <i>Unknown Man</i> (Cat. No. 51), both of which show Des Granges' style at its best, evolving towards this neat, evenly modulated painting of the features. Overall, the creamy, brownish tonality gives the work a 'look' of Des Granges and is on a scale which would, exceptionally, suggest that he responded to the fashion for small miniatures in the early 1650s. But Des Granges was a signer, and it is difficult to believe that he would not have added his initials and the date in the space temptingly available on the brown background over the sitter's left shoulder. \n\nThe case for Alexander Cooper would depend on comparison with the small portraits in the Dutch Royal Collection, and with the most soberly coloured of his products from the 1640s to the end of his career. Since there is still so much uncertainty about Alexander Cooper's stylistic development, it is possible to argue that the style here falls within the range of his 'fine and broad' manners, still accepted as characterising his oeuvre. The scale is one on which Alexander Cooper was well used to working. However, close comparison with the earlier Signed works by him in the present catalogue (<i>Charles Louis</i>, Cat. No. 55, and <i>Unknown Man</i>, Cat. No. 56), both of which show Alexander Cooper's firm and direct red-brown hatching, is discouraging.\" ",
