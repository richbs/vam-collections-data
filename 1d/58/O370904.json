In Egypt woodturning is an important local craft: it is known as mashrabyah. \n\nThis object is an example of a decorative mashrabyah (or hand turned screen). This type of inlaid mashrabyah work can still be seen on Mamluk minbars in Cairo (the Mamluks were a military elite who ruled Egypt between 1250 and 1515).\n\nThe wooden frame is a later addition which was added when the object entered a private collection. It probably dates to the late 19th century.This object formed part of the Meymar collection \u2013 a collection of Islamic and Middle Eastern objects collected by the Turkish bureaucrat known as Dr Meymar who was based in Cairo in the 1860s.This collection was exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1867, from where the South Kensington Museum (V&A) made a large number of purchases to enhance their growing collection of Islamic art. Together with the collection of Gaston de Saint-Maurice (accessioned in 1884), the Meymar collection was the foundational collection of \u2018Saracenic\u2019 art \u2013 or the art of the Mamluks (ruled Egypt and Syria 1250-1517) \u2013 in this museum.",
