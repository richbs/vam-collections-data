The whole is surmounted by a dentil cornice below which is a frieze formed of oblong panels carved with strapwork and floral scrolls with figures and masks. Along the bottom is a skirting border of strapwork. The panelling is divided at intervals by pilasters, the bases of which are carved with cartouche and strapwork, the shaft panels filled with formal scrolls of fruit and flowers, and with figures, terminals, birds and animals; above are Corinthian capitals surmounted by brackets carved with lions' masks. The panelling includes three doors with wrought iron hinges and latches. Also a piece of panelling 3 ft. 5 in. (104.1 cm) high and two smaller pieces (from below the windows) composed of a row of upright panels, with a row of oblong panels above carved with strapwork and foliage and having a shell in the centre. Removed from a house near Exeter. End of 16th century. From catalogue Total length about 41 ft., H. 8 ft. 2 in. (Total length about 1249.7 cm, H. 249 cm) This panelling corresponds closely with that at Bamfylde House, Exeter (see Museum Negatives, Nos. 32142 and 32143); also with that in the Dining Room at Bradfield Hall, near Exeter (see Negatives Nos. 32285 and 32289).\nFrom: H.
