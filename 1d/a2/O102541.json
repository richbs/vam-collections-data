Her hair is centre parted and smooth to the head and is crowned with a wreath of pink and yellow flowers. The small blue bodice is trimmed with a pink and a yellow flower and under is a short-sleeved, low-cut, white blouse; from the back emerge green wings.  Below the green and yellow pointed waistband, the knee-length, pink-tinted skirt is trimmed with two yellow flounces and, to the left side of front, small groups of flowers; over the skirt is a diaphanous top skirt.  Her ballet slippers are tinted blue. To the left, in front of a cross, stands a ghostly draped female figure.",

The peasant girl Giselle commits suicide when betrayed by her aristocratic lover; she becomes a Wili, the spirit of a jilted girl who dies unmarried and spends eternity seeking vengence on all men. To quote Heinrich Heine, who revived the Germanic legend on which the ballet was based, 'At midnight, and in the bright moonlight, they rise in crowds, arrayed in their bridal dresses, wreathed with flowers and sparkling with jewels; their faces, though pale, have the beauty of youth, and winning smiles play upon their lips.  Woe to the young man whose evil destiny leads him within the reach of their perfidious fascination!  He is compelled to join their wild orgies, and to dance till, from exhaustion, he sinks down and expires.'\nAdele Dumil\u00e2tre created the role of Myrtha, Queen of the Wilis. In her hand she holds a sprig of rosemary, which symbolises remembrance; garlands of rosemary were often placed on the coffins of young lovers who died of a broken heart.  She has used the wand to summon Giselle's spirit, which stands in front of the cross marking her grave.",

Lithography, with its soft quality, enhanced by the delicate yet rich hand-colouring, was ideally suited to the subject - the ballerinas who dominated ballet in the mid-century and the romanticised settings in which they performed; style and subject were perfectly matched.  The British lithographs are notable for capturing individual performers and their style, often clearly in a theatrical setting.  They capture dance and its interpreters at one of its greatest periods.",
