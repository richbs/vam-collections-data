The town was founded as an army camp and in the second century AD became the headquarters of the Third Augustan Legion, whose responsibility was the defence of North Africa. The Praetorium was the residence of the Roman military commander.  This painting is probably by the artist known as Lauret ain\u00e9, i.e. the elder, to distinguish him from his brother Fran\u00e7ois, who also worked in Algeria. It is possible that this watercolour is by Fran\u00e7ois, as it is signed only `Lauret\u2019.\n\nThe brothers were both painters of landscapes and rural scenes, born in Pignans (Var). Lauret Ain\u00e9 worked in Toulon, and then lived in Algeria 1850-62. He spent three years in Spain before revisiting Algeria; then returned to Toulon. Fran\u00e7ois Lauret was a pupil of his brother and of J.H. Belloc in Paris.  He also worked in Toulon and subsequently joined his brother in Algeria 1851-54.  Both brothers probably exhibited at the Salon, 1841-66.",
