She also has bisque forearms and hands, and probably lower legs and feet; her torso and other limbs are of papier mach\u00e9. The head and forearms are on flexible wire fittings to enable their movement.  Her legs and feet are encased in stockings of beige knitted cotton, with red satin shoes, through which two screws fasten her to the rectangular base covered with maroon velvet. It has not so far been possible to identify exactly what the doll's actions represent, as her props and identifying costume do not survive, but she may have been smelling a perfume or a flower, or looking closely at something.",

The best known and most highly regarded makers at this time were French or based in France, notably Roullet et Descamps, and Vichy and Lambert (the maker of this piece).  \n\nProbably the most frequently made examples represented pretty or amusing young humans or animals, but there was also a taste for grotesques, such as demons, wizards, cigarette-smoking monkeys and racial stereotypes.  Most automata were at the higher-priced end of the market in amusements, and were not necessarily playthings for children - although many children would have had memories of seeing them.  An automaton like this is making a  contextual point in the history of childhood, and reflects the fact that such items were often either a family amusement or a public one, since automata were sometimes used in shop displays.  Their overall popularity partly reflects the human liking for moving amusements which has since probably been more deeply satisfied by films, computers and television; the other constant appeal lies in the fantasy of dolls and other inanimate figures coming to life, as in the ballet 'Coppelia'.",
