Maps are a recurrent feature in her printmaking. This print was commissioned for the Northern Print Biennale held in Newcastle in 2009, and is a pictorial map of places associated with printmaking in Newcastle/Gateshead and the surrounding areas. \n\nThe artist describes the commission as follows: \"I was invited by Northern Print to create a new original print for Northen Print Biennale 2009 that investigated print in the city of NewcastleGateshead. I spent a week researching places and people that had connections with print (of all kinds) and created an abstracted map to show visitors the unusual examples I discovered. The second part of this commission was to create a digital map that could be downloaded by visitors the the event. The final piece was a double sided A4 page that could be folded into a book and used as a passport to collect the specific rubber stamps that were placed at participating Biennale venues.\"",
