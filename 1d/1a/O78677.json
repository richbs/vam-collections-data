They realized that there was an increasing and lucrative market for boxes such as this one. In 1780 they had introduced commercially-prepared cakes or pans of watercolour, which were inexpensive, portable and easy to use. The colours were already prepared and formed into cakes with a binding medium, thus avoiding the messy and tedious preparation of pigments that had been necessary hitherto. Some artists still relied on the traditional method of grinding their own colours and mixing their own solutions of natural gum in water, but these improvements in solid colour-cake manufacture had rendered the practice unnecessary.\n\nTechnique\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, watercolour painting was a polite accomplishment for young men and women. This enabled otherwise impoverished artists to make a living as drawing-masters to the children of wealthy families.",
