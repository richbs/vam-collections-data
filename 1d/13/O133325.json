The chair admirably reflects the simplicity of furniture then being made under the influence of the Bauhaus, and is interesting historically because it shows the personal taste of Pevsner, the leading historian of Modernism, a decade before he wrote his seminal work 'Pioneers of Modern Design' (1936).",
