They are unique, made by him, sometimes drawn upon, making aesthetic use of damage and scratches and often surrounded with decorated borders of cut and coloured card and pen and ink patterns. His images show an enchantment with women : everyday muses - ordinary women shopping, sunbathing, sitting on benches or simply strolling around. The damage, rough hand-decorated borders and general patina of age of the prints adds to their allure. They make a wonderful example and contrast - of how it is not always the pristine, fine print by the acknowledged master that can hold a place on the gallery wall and in the Museum.",

From the 1960s until the 1990s, rejected from mainstream society, Tichy began to photograph people on the streets of the town of Brno, with home-made cameras made from wood, tape, beer bottle tops and drainpipe. His images show a voyeuristic interest in everyday women in public spaces - shopping, walking, relaxing. Tichy was 79 when his first retrospective was held at the Kunsthaus, Zurich in 2005. In contrast to pristine, museum quality prints, this photograph reveals its history through its roughly but lovingly made mount and non professional printing.",
