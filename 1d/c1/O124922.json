His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nHomage to the Queen, a Sadler's Wells Ballet production choreographed by Frederick Ashton (1904-1988), celebrated the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II on 2 June, 1953.  The ballet featured a procession of the four elements, earth, water, fire and air and an apotheosis.  The formal, courtly theme inspired Messel to produce lavish, fantastical designs inspired by Jacobean court ballets or masques, in the manner of Inigo Jones (1573-1672). \n\nQueen Elizabeth I hands the newly-crowned Elizabeth II her royal regalia, an Orb and Sceptre, in the final apotheosis scene.  Messel designed an Elizabethan court dress, which featured liberal use of gold and silver brocade and sunburst decorations on the skirt, a symbol of monarchy.   The sunbursts were made of leather painted bronze-gold and embellished with gold tinsel and rhinestones.",

Violetta Elvin played the Queen of the Waters and John Hart was her Consort.  Nadia Nerina was the Queen of the Earth, and Alexis Rassine was her Consort.  It was also performed at the Metropolitan Opera House,  New York, 18 September 1953 and Detroit, San Francisco and Brussels in 1958.   \nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's theatre designs and other designs and artefacts.  The designs were briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being housed at the V&A from 1981 on indefinite loan.  The V&A Theatre Museum purchased the Oliver Messel collection from Lord Snowdon in 2005.",
