            "public_access_description": "Ro Hae Sin was born in 1965 and graduated from the College of Art and Design, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, Korea. She is professor in the Department of Ceramics at Kongju University, Korea. She has exhibited in several exhibitions in Korea and abroad including Cheongju International Craft Biennale, Korea  and From the Fire: Contemporary Korean Ceramics 2004-2007, in the U.S.\n\nThe artist's research aims to combine colour with form and to create a reciprocal relationship between them. She exploits the characteristics of colour as a communication tool to generate a wide range of emotions and sensations. She then plays with these perceptions of colours and associates them with forms, simple in their whole but intricate in their details.\nThe work is made using the slip-casting technique. The pieces are coloured by painting slip directly on to the moulds in differing stages. \n\nThe piece was shown as part of the  exhibition Tradition Transformed ( from 20 May to 3 October 2011 at the  V&A). Tradition Transformed  showcases the work of contemporary  Korean ceramic artists who combine  traditional methods with modern ingenuity and innovative techniques.",

            "bibliography": "The work implies a variety of different colours in the controlled shapes. The artist attempts to create a reciprocal relationship between form and colour. With this in mind, the clay expressions can be perceived as phenomenal units. With each piece of work, the artist experiments to combine colour with form. Colour is observed as a means to express different emotions. Different colours possess varying characteristics, insinuating movement, weight and atmosphere. Furthermore, colours bring out inner sensitivity and appreciation of beauty. They evoke our hidden senses and thoughts. The process of making is both delicate and complex. It requires much patience and time. The work is made using the slip-casting technique and the technical aspect is intriguing. The pieces are coloured by painting slip directly on to the moulds in differing stages. The body colour is applied as the final colour. From start to completion the work is about patience, discipline, control and colour. The moulds for the work are made with plaster and because they contain intricate details, the actual moulds can be considered as pieces of artwork in themselves",
