It is very faded and the pattern is difficult to see. The two pieces have been attached at right angles so the weft of the large piece is now running from top to bottom. The pale yellow ground has been divided by fine lines into circular and lobed compartments containing blue and pink flowers. There is evidence of metal thread (silver strip open S-wound on yellow silk). There is a square of fabric in each corner, badly worn, with an indistinct pattern in light blue, pink and green with a silver metal strip used with the weft. Three of the side borders have a very dark ground (blue or black) which seems to be divided into a lattice with densely packed leaf and floral motifs woven in metal thread (silver strip close s-wound on yellow silk core). These borders along the top and down the left hand side include a narrow band in pink and metal thread which might indicate a loom end. The border along the right hand side is different and has a blue ground with a dense floral pattern woven with metal thread (silver strip open s-wound on yellow silk) with a twill binding.\n\nBacking: pieced red cotton.\nFacing: bias cut dark red silk.",
