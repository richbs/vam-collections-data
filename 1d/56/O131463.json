            "public_access_description": "This stool is one of several types of seat furniture designed for Henry and Barbara Church's villa in Ville d'Avray, France.  The villa was designed by the Modernist architect Le Corbusier.  The furniture was created by him in collaboration with his colleagues Pierre Jeanneret and Charlotte Perriand.  They also designed a chaise longue, a club chair and a swing-back chair for the house.  \n\nModernism advocated free-flowing open spaces in architecture, and the furniture that inhabited these spaces was designed specifically with this in mind.  The clean, uncluttered lines of this stool reflect this.  Steel, in this case tubular steel, which provided strength without bulk, became a popular material in Modernist furniture.  Charlotte Perriand said that 'metal plays the same part in furniture as cement has done in architecture', implying that it had become an essential component of furniture design.",
