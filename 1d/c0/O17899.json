Finally they are twisted and stitched at the neck to form a plaited edge.  The dress has one strap over the left shoulder and the other is left bare.  The bodice pleats are couched onto a cream silk crepeline foundation which is boned and has a wired brassiere.  A straight, heavy, white silk cr\u00eape petticoat is attached to a white grosgrain waist stay.  The dress fastens at the left seam with small hooks and eyes.  The main seams and hem are machine- stitched but the rest of the garment is hand sewn.\n[Waist cord] Narrow rouleau belt in the same jersey.",

Madame Gr\u00e8s trained as a sculptor and then turned to haute couture, becoming 'Alix', with premises in the Faubourg St Honor\u00e9 in Paris. She re-opened at 1 rue de La Paix in 1941 as 'Gr\u00e8s'. A house press release described Madame Gr\u00e8s' personal manner of handling materials 'almost without seams', and how she 'induced manufacturers to produce jersey in large widths and took part in their researches to apply these techniques'.\n\nThis dress forms part of the Cecil Beaton Collection, brought together by the society photographer Sir Cecil Beaton (1904-1980). With great energy and determination, Beaton contacted the well-dressed elite of Europe and North America to help create this lasting monument to the art of dress. The Collection was exhibited in 1971, accompanied by a catalogue that detailed its enormous range.",
