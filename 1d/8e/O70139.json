The panels are surrounded by foliated scrollwork and in the front a woman's mask, at the back a lion's mask, variously coloured in blue, yellow and green against a blue ground. The lower part of the body is gadrooned in yellow relief. The lid has a foliated grinning mask on the outer side and the handle is moulded with a figure of a woman, her hand resting on a cornucopia, and with an acanthus leaf.
