The following is the full text of the entry: school of BERNINI, GIOVANNI LORENZO 631 Recto Design of the back of a state carriage, showing two tritons fighting Pen and ink and wash over black chalk 8 7/8 X 9 5/8 (225 X 245) 8814 A Verso Fragment of a design showing what appears to be a rusticated column or quoin Pencil PROVENANCE An initial B in ink may be the mark of Edward Bouverie, though not very close to Lugt 325; bought 1880 Drawings of this type are often ascribed to Bernini's assistant Giovanni Paolo Schor, but the characteristics of his style are still not absolutely clear, and this particular drawing looks more like Bernini himself or a careful imitator. Domenico Bernini in his Vita del Cavalier Giovanni Lorenzo Bernino, Rome, 1713, p. 103, reports that Bernini designed the carriage in which Queen Christina made her state entry into Rome 1655/6. It is possible that this drawing may be connected with that design, but not very likely, since two fighting tritons would not have been the most fitting embellishment to the carriage of a Protestant queen who was coming to Rome to be received into the Catholic faith. For an account of the carriage designs of Schor, see Blunt and Cooke, Windsor, p. IIO; and also Schaar, p. 49. For an account of the few facts that are known about the carriage given to Queen Christina by the Pope for her entry into Rome see Georgina Masson, 'Papal gifts and Roman entertainments in honour of Queen Christinas's arrival' in Analecta Reginensia I Queen Christina of Sweden. Documents and Studies. Edited by Magnus von Platen. Stockholm, 1966, pp. 244-251; and also P. Bjurstrom, Feast and Theatre in Queen Christina's Rome, Stockholm, 1966, pp. II7123. Both these works are useful on the question of 17th century carriage design in general. Verso not illustrated",
