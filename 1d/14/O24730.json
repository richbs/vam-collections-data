A third attribute is the stupa, visible in his headress.  His hair is piled up to form a crown, which is decorated with locks of hair forming loops.  He wears the simple waistcloth (sampong) secured with a cord.  This sculpture relates closely to the group of bronzes associated with the temple site at Pra Kon Chai, in north-eastern Thailand.  These bronzes represent a tradition separate from the Khmers and may belong to the Canasa kingdom, a state which retained its independence from the Khmers until the 10th century.  The burial of such a large group of Buddhist bronzes may have occured at the time of the conversion of the region to Hinduism, early in the 10th century.",
