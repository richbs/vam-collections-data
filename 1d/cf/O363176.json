            "physical_description": "Shawl with a pale blue ground of twilled silk. With a lively design of pagodas, pavilions and boats, decked with banners, flowers filling their forms and larger flowers and cones springing from their structures. The boats are curved like daggers, the sterns build very high with a pavilion, a large bird with a spray of flowers in its beak is perched on the bow, and inside are banners and a tiny schematic human figure. These motifs are arranged about a central medallion filled with flowers and cones, the quarters of which fill the corners of the field. There are two borders. The outer one is of palmette forms on meandering stems with fillings of flowers on a white ground, set between two guard-stripes of blue with a floral meander. The inner and wider border consists of shapes suggesting domed pavilions set between inclined cones. Some flower-filled ribbon shapes have turned into snakes with heads and forked tails. At the inner edge of the border, turrets, domes and feathery fronds project into the pale blue field.\n\nThe colours used for the woollen weft threads are predominantly a scarlet red, a wine red, a bright green and a mid-blue with grey tones. White and a deep yellow are also used. The warp has been dyed or printed at the two ends, and for the length of side borders, so that all the borders are shaded with red, as the centre is with pale blue. The very ends of the warp have been coloured to form fringe and narrow panels in plain colours of red, green, black, white and yellow. The warp fringe is loosely twisted. The selvedge is woven with green silk.\n\nThe technique consists of a ground warp and weft woven in 2 x 2 twill, and brocaded weft bound in 2/1 twill.",
