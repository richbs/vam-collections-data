Sk\u00e5ne province, in the extreme south of Sweden, has the richest tradition, and more jewellery was worn there than in any other district.   Almost all the Swedish traditional jewellery at the V&A comes from Sk\u00e5ne.  \n\nA well-dressed woman from Sk\u00e5ne wore multiple pairs of silver clasps along the front edges of her outer clothes.  Some of these were functional, and hooked into each other.  Others were purely ornamental.  \n\nHeart-shaped clasps like these were originally worn as cloak clasps, but by the 19th century they had moved to the outer jacket, and were often purely decorative.  Clasps decorated with filigree were a speciality of the silversmiths in Lund and Ystad.  This pair is marked with the maker's mark JW.  Jonas Wahlberg was a prolific maker of traditional jewellery, who worked in Ystad from 1834 to 1859.",
