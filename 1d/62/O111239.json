Bronzes could now be mass produced and the growing middle class was keen to collect luxury goods. Barye was the first and foremost of the sculptors who specialised in this genre. This bronze was purchased from the International Exhibition of 1855.\n\nAlthough this was a poplar neo-classical subject, Barye's modelling of the surfaces has a vibrancy and movement characteristic of French romantic sculpture. The Theseus was executed relatively early in the sequence of small bronzes produced by Barye from the beginning of the 1830s onwards. Most were animal subjects, prompting Gautier's description of him as the \"Michelangelo of the menagerie\".",
