The front is pleated from the neckline, spreading out into sculptural folds at the hem. \n\nSchiaparelli was famous for elaborately decorated garments, and for using unexpected prints. She was also skilled at designing deceptively simple dresses which made a feature of skillful cutting and construction. Her designs often showed a sense of humour, which is evident here. The dress resembles a fluted marble pillar, making a surrealist pun on the term 'column dress'. Subtle, understated dresses such as this were the perfect foil for Schiaparelli's embellished jackets, outrageous jewellery, and attention-grabbing accessories.",
