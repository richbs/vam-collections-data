            "public_access_description": "The Fillmore in San Francisco is a historic music venue, named after its original location at the intersection of Fillmore Street and Geary Boulevard. Known as the Fillmore Auditorium in the mid-1960s, concert promoter Bill Graham began a series of concerts featuring bands from the counterculture of the time. In 1968, due to his spiralling success, he moved to a larger venue which he named Fillmore West. Having closed in 1971, and after extensive repair work to fix earthquake damage, Graham's was revived when Live Nation reopened the original Fillmore venue in 1994.\n\nSan Francisco in the mid-1960s was the hub of the LSD and Hippie scene and the cultural and political rebellion of 1967's Summer of Love. The resulting influence of these factors on the artists of the area created the fantastic psychedelic posters of the Fillmore. Art dealer Jacaeber Kastor said of the posters, \"They couldn't just tell you the information about the show. They had to tell you what kind of people you might meet, what kind of far out trip you might have or perhaps even reveal the mysteries of the universe. Wow. Quantum mechanics, visual mudwrestling, Acid test pop quiz on a phone pole!\"\n\nThis gig featured Love, an American rock band formed in 1965 in Los Angeles. They were instantly popular on the LA club scene, an energetic and loud band, often stoned. Their 1967 album, Forever Changes, is oft cited as one of the greatest albums ever made. Also on the bill was jazz multi-instrumentalist Roland Kirk. Kirk was a blind musician who appeared onstage with several different obscure types of saxophone around his neck, and other instruments including flutes and whistles, often with a gong in reach. He could play several wind instruments at a time, creating chords, and also used many non-musical devices such as sirens or alarm clocks. His studio output often used primitive electronic sounds and tape-manipulated musique concr\u00e8te.",
