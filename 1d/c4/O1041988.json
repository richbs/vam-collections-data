(about 5 1/8 x 8 3/8 ins.) and the paper bearing the truncated watermark: J WHATMAN 182[ ... ]. The only internal clue to the places where the sketch-book was used or to its date is the almost illegible inscription on No. 385. If this is correctly read <i>Findon Wood</i>, the book was used by Constable on a visit to George Constable at Arundel, that is, in 1834 or 1835.  This supposition is borne out by the style of the drawings, many of which are in the vigorous, unpolished and strong manner which characterises the water-colours of Constable's last years compare, for instance, No. 390 [222-1888] with p. 9 of No. 382 [316-1888], the intact sketch-book of 1835. \nHolmes dates No. 386 [238-1888] (following the identification of the scene as Epsom) c.183I; Nos. 385 [228-1888] and 391 [212-1888] he dates c.1832, and Nos. 387, 388, 389, 390 and 392 [226-1888, 234-1888, 231-1888, 222-1888, 230-1888] he assigns to c.1834.
