Pierced, scrolling foliage surrounds a stylised ram's head. Further foliage issues from the ram's mouth. Traces of paint are visible. The present doorway at the Temple Church appears to be a Victorian replacement, or copy, of the Romanesque originals, of which the present piece is one, that are now in the V&A.\n\nThe Temple Church was consecrated on the 10th February 1185, but the church suffered clumbsy restorations in recent times, as well as 'improvements' and repairs throughout its history, and finally pollution today, not to mention the air-raids by the Luftwaffe.",
