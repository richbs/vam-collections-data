Westwood\u2019s career in fashion was galvanised by McLaren and together they launched memorable fashion moments, including Punk in the early 1970s and later their Pirates collection. McLaren and Westwood conducted a design relationship between 1971 and 1983. In 1990 and again in 1991 Vivienne Westwood was named British Designer of the Year; she has also received an OBE.\n\nWestwood\u2019s unique mix of practicality and inventiveness, her preoccupation with silhouette and the manner in which she manipulates fabrics result in dynamic fashion. Westwood herself once said, 'You have a much better life if you wear impressive clothes.\u2019 \n\nThis design on this banner, created at the time of the 'Seditionaries' collection during the height of the Punk movement, was printed as a flyer for Westwood and McLaren's shop on the King's Road. The banner was created for the Sex Pistols last British concert, on Christmas day 1977, which was a special gig for the children of striking firefighters. It is printed with a George Cruikshank cartoon and includes a lengthy text which references the anarchic creed of the band.",
