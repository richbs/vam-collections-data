NUNO designers are renowned for their ability to develop and apply the latest technology to textile design and manufacture.  However, much of their work is also based on traditional Japanese textile techniques and aesthetics, and it is this fusion of the traditional with the contemporary that makes NUNO fabrics so innovative. Devor\u00e9 is a method of fabric patterning in which vegetable fibres are selectively dissolved with acid to leave a design.  To produce the 'crackle quilt' effect, rayon and wool have been quilted together and printed with an acid substance that burns away the rayon fibres and creates a crackled surface.  The fabric is then tumble dried to fray the chemically etched pattern, creating an 'aged' quality reminiscent of an historical quilt.",
