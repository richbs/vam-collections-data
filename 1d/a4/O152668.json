The program controlled a pen plotter - a machine that guides a pen across a drawing surface according to instructions from the computer.  From this one program, the computer was capable of producing a large number of drawings.  The V&A has three other drawings produced using the same code (E.131-2008, E.132-2008 and E.225-2008).\n\nBIG DIM was the name of the series and is an abbreviation of BIG DIMENSION.  The numbers in the title refer to the data that the computer selected and used to structure the drawing.\n\nPaul Brown is an Anglo-Australian artist who studied at the Experimental Department at the Slade, University of London in the 1970s.  At that time, the Slade was one of the few institutions that fully integrated the use of computers in art into its teaching curriculum.An interest in the use of systems and generative processes in art led Brown to begin working with computers in 1974.",
