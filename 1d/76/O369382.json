They reflect the popularity of the neo-classical style at the time. The profile of Porus is carved in ebony, a hard, close-grained wood, probably chosen here to imitate a hardstone cameo.  The eagle, military trophies, lion mask and floral swags are of boxwood.  Porus was a king in the Punjab, India who fought against Alexander the Great in the Battle of the Hydaspes River in June 326 BCE.  Porus was defeated but continued as a satrap or viceroy for Alexander.\n\nIn 1797 Genoa had been invaded by the French revolutionary army of Napoleon Bonaparte.  On 14 June Napoleon overthrew the Most Serene Republic of Genoa, established in 1005, and replaced it with the Ligurian Republic as a state fully under the control of France. Clearly, Alexander (shown on 748-1875) represents the invading Napoleon but we have not yet identified the local leader whom Porus was intended to represent.",

There have existed at Milan for the last half century various members of the\"Arrigoni\" family who have continued as dealers in works of Art to show considerable dexterity and good judgments [sic]. These specimens are certainly very delicate and pretty but are somewhat \"mesquiso\" in style.  The touch with the woodcarvers [sic] gouge is better however than usual. I would recommend the purchase of the pair if they could be got for say one hundred and fifty pounds the pair [they had been offered for \u00a3200] but I should be disinclined to recommend them at a higher price.'  They were purchased for \u00a3150 from Mr T.M. Whitehead.",
