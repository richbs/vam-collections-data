Sprays of stylised flowers in blue and orange are tied, at intervals, with bows and lengths of white lacy ribbon onto the golden ribbon. The ribbed tabby ground in grey warp and grey and white weft is patterned with brocaded coloured silks of a coarse weave. The meandering ribbon is rendered in brocaded silver gilt thread with a yellow silk core, both in fil\u00e9 and fris\u00e9. Additional touches of the fris\u00e9 gold thread are brocaded in the flowers. The colouring is bold, eight different shades being employed together with white. The piece is a loom width, retaining both selvages, a quarter an inch wide, and containing ten cords of a mixture of red, white and blue silks.",
