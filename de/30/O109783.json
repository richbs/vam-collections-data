Individual pieces of scented white lead were moulded into human figures, horses or other forms, and usually stuck to a gilt background. Virtually identical motifs can be found on other boxes, presumably from the same workshop. Legends of Ancient Rome and love stories from Greek Mythology, such as the Judgement of Paris and the Rape of Helen of Troy on this example, were popular themes on pastiglia boxes.",

This was often scented and described in contemporary inventories as <i>pasta di muschio</i> (musk paste). The <i>pastiglia</i> figures and motifs were shaped with a lead mould and then glued to the gilt surface of the box - hence their frequent recurrence on other boxes. The boxes are decorated with legends of Ancient Rome and the scenes copied from woodcuts such as Jacobus Argentoratensis' <i>Triumph of Caesar</i> (Venice, 1504) or illustrations of Livy's <i>Roman History</i>.\n(Label text, circa 2000, from old Medieval & Renaissance Galleries)",
