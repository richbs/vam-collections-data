It went on to become the best-selling book of the 19th century, becoming known to audiences on both sides of the Atlantic through the publication itself and its many \u2018spin-offs\u2019, which included illustrated song sheets, theatre productions, ceramic figures and even wallpaper designs. \n\nThis poster was made to promote a theatre production of around 1905. It depicts a scene from the novel in which Eva, a white girl whom Tom had rescued from drowning before being bought to work on her family\u2019s plantation, experiences a vision of heaven at death. Her vision leads those around her to resolve to change their lives. Eva\u2019s father promises to free Tom but is killed before being able to do so and Tom is sold to a vicious plantation owner.\n\nUncle Tom\u2019s Cabin is often credited as a driving force behind America\u2019s anti-slavery movement. However it also contributed to the negative stereotyping of black people, particularly in the character of Uncle Tom who passively accepts his fate.",
