The two sections form an overall pattern. The canopy is extended to include sections at the bottom, each made up of a flattened pointed and decorated arch enclosing an open clover-shaped design. \n\nThe canopy has lost part of its tracery on the left side. There are traces of gilding on the canopy. Formalized spiky cross designs survive on the bottom border beneath the open tracery. The designs are in gilt on a red background. The back of the canopy has two lead-plugged holes and is cut away as if to allow light from the back to filter through the traceries at the front. The back of the canopy is incised with an 'X.'\n\nThere are two sorts of alabaster. Calcite alabaster is very hard and was used in ancient times. This object is made of gypsum alabaster which is a fine-grained, soft and smooth stone. Although at first glance it looks a little like marble, which it was intended to imitate, it was much easier to carve due to its softness, and alabaster objects were therefore significantly cheaper to produce. Marble does not originate in England, so it was imported if needed, whereas in the 15th century there were important alabaster quarries in Nottingham, York, Burton-on-Trent and London. England was a major centre for the production of objects such as this one. During period, they were exported in very large numbers to Europe where they survive, unlike many examples which remained in England and were destroyed or greatly damaged during the Reformation.",
