Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. Above all they had to have the means of attaching the cord. In this example, there are a pair of holes (himotoshi) on the bottom of the sandal.  Although netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated is the katabori (shape carving). This is a three-dimensional carving, such as this netsuke of Raijin.\n\nIn Japanese mythology Raijin, God of the Wind, is portrayed, as within this netsuke, as a horned demon with humanistic features with a thunder drum. This netsuke is rather unusual in its arrangement as Raijin is surrounded by numerous drums instead of holding just one. It represents the innovative development of a common theme and highlights the creativity and diversity of netsuke carvers. By using glass for the eyes the carver has accentuated Raiden's animated features.",
