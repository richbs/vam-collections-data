The names of the female clients inscribed on the designs were of the aristocracy.  Miss Emily Pelham gave her sister's (Lady Middleton's) pattern to a family friend, Miss Holroyd. The Pelhams and Holroyds had country homes in what is now Surrey and East Sussex respectively and so not far away.  The families came to London for the season.  Lady Middleton (who was Frances Pelham) died in 1783 and so five years later Emily gave her sister's design to her friend.  Retailers who sold such designs were linen drapers and lacemakers, both of which categories existed in London and were available to the clients. Many pattern drawers worked in London where their trade proved a lucrative business during the season. The similarity of some of the designs from this group to those by Styart, whose designs were published in London, does support the argument that these designs came from a retailer's archive based in London.",

            "production_note": "The design comes from a group of designs that were part of a retailer's archive which employed professional embroiderers. The names of the female clients inscribed on the designs were of the aristocracy, gentry or from wealthy families that moved in the upper reaches of society.  They had homes in the country and came to London for the season.  Retailers who sold such designs were linen drapers and lacemakers, both of which categories existed in London and were available to the clients. Many pattern drawers worked in London where their trade proved a lucrative business during the season. The similarity of some of the designs from this group to those by Styart, whose designs were published in London, does support the argument that these designs came from a retailer's archive based in London.   The tassels and bow are similar to those in an anonymous design entitled 'A New Pattern for Working a Muff' 'Engraved for the Ladys Magazine' in The Lady's Magazine, London, Oct.21, 1785 between pp.528-529.  Inscribed 'Mrs' [illegible inscription] in pen and ink",

This is evidence of the repeated use of designs amongst friends and relatives.  Lady Middleton - Miss Emily Pelham - The Hon. Miss Holroyd. Lady Middleton's design was dated '1785' however and the copy is dated '1788'. Perhaps it was acceptable to wear the same pattern after a few years.",
