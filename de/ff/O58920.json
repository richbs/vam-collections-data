The sections are turned and bored, the outer surfaces wrapped with turtle shell, which is overlapped and welded to itself after heating.  The turtle shell would then be polished so that no line of joining is apparent.\n[Treble recorder] A slightly bulbous ivory mouthpiece is turned with plain mouldings at the base.  It is cut away on the underside and the fruitwood core is visible, with the fruitwood infill.  Below this the joint is veneered in turtle shell, turned in the shell with shallow collars at top and bottom and showing on the top and bottom edge a pattern in gold piqu\u00e9 of addorsed S-scrolls with pendants including small circles of mother of pearl.  Below the voicing aperture (through which the fruitwood core is visible) the turtle shell is inlaid with two coats of arms in gold, below a closed crown which is deeply engraved into the turtle shell. The dexter shield is barry of five, the two  gold bars each engraved with continuous curving motifs.  The sinister shield is barry of six, the three  gold bars each engraved with two horizontal lines, the three bars of shell each inlaid in gold with single fleurs-de-lys.  The core of the joint is visible below the lower edge of the turtle shell, where it extends approximately 4 cm to provide the core for the ivory collar (:2).\n[Collar] Collar of ivory, of barrel form, turned at top and bottom with small, plain mouldings.\n[Main joint] A plain, turned section, veneered with turtle shell and inlaid with bands of gold and mother- of-pearl inlay  at top and bottom.  The core of the joint extends beyond the decorated area at each end to provide for connection with the adjacent sections of the recorder, the narrower areas bound with fine cord to provide a tight fit.  The joint is set with five finger holes on the top surface, each with an inlaid, framing mount in the form of a baroque cartouche, of engraved silver and with an additional finger hole below these, which is set within the inlaid decoration and shows no framing mount. There is an additional finger hole, with a similar collar, on the underside at the top.\n[Bottom joint] A bell-shaped foot joint, with a turned ivory collar at the top and an ivory edge section to the base.  The upper edge of the turtle-shell collar is set with the freize of addorsed S-scrolls in gold piqu\u00e9 and mother of pearl.  The upper ivory collar is pierced with one finger hole on the underside of the instrument",

The treble recorder was played in the key of F, and composers like Johann Sebastian Bach (1685 - 1750) and Antonio Vivaldi (1678 - 1741) wrote music for it.  However, by about 1780 the recorder had lost its place in the orchestra to the flute, a louder instrument. Before the museum acquired this object, it formed part of a decorative trophy of old wind instruments that hung on a wall of the Paris apartment of Gioacchino Rossini (1792 - 1868), the great Italian composer of light opera.",

It bears inlaid in gold the arms  -[sketch added here]. It belonged to Rossini's well-known trophy, and was well worthy to do so as it is a really fine specimen of the feasability of applying art to musical instruments of a similar class. It general form is somewhat this - [sketch added here] - and very elegant. Upon the whole I think the prices asked reasonable for this object and recomment the purchase. '  The recorder was purchased form M. Bauer, for 600 francs (24).\n[Bottom joint] This is an early acquisition for which there are no Registered Papers.  It was bought from Mr M. Bauer on 12 July 1869 for \u00a324.0.0. and was described as a <i>flute \u00e0 bec</i>.",

Pieces decorated with these materials were popular souvenirs for travellers making the Grand Tour.  Turtle  shell was extremely soft, and could be worked with gentle heat and polishing, so that joins in the pieces used for covering items could be 'welded' together, as on this instrument, which shows not join lines in the veneer. The arms incorporated into the design of this instrument suggest that it was a particular commission.",
