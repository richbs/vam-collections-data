Changarnier was a leading figure in suppressing the revolutionary movement in 1848 and 1849.\n\nThe hilt is decorated with the archangel Michael, and the use of oxidisation is typical of Froment-Meurice's interest in surface treatments and decorative effects. He was hugely celebrated as a jeweller and goldsmith, winning medals and accolades whenever he exhibited. The Museum bought extensively from the firm, an indication of its reputation. Much of this success was due to his workshop subcontractors, who included some of the finest artists and craftsmen of the period. Froment-Meurice's stand at the Great Exhibition was unusual amongst the French manufacturers for its mixture of plate, jewellery and objects of vertu. The 1854 catalogue of articles purchased by the Museum observed that \"the handle of this sword is very elegant in design and perfect in execution\".",

Bought for \u00a340\nExhibited at the Great Exhibition and subsequently bought for \u00a340, this is a copy of a sword made for General Changarnier and presented to him by the Municipality of Paris. Changarnier was a leading figure in suppressing the revolutionary movement in 1848 and 1849.\n\nThe hilt is decorated with the archangel Michael, and the use of oxidisation is typical of Froment-Meurice's interest in surface treatments and decorative effects. He was hugely celebrated as a jeweller and goldsmith, winning medals and accolades whenever he exhibited. The Museum bought extensively from the firm, an indication of its reputation. Much of this success was due to his workshop subcontractors, who included some of the finest artists and craftsmen of the period. Froment-Meurice's stand at the Great Exhibition was unusual amongst the French manufacturers for its mixture of plate, jewellery and objects of vertu. The 1854 catalogue of articles purchased by the Museum observed that \"the handle of this sword is very elegant in design and perfect in execution\".",
