These details all suggest this is an early micromosaic.  The tesserae that make up the background are also square, and used in straight lines - another characteristic of early micromosaic, a technique which was being refined in Rome towards the end of the 18th century.\n\nThis micromosaic, made in Rome, is dated to about 1800.  The frame, however, is thought to be of about 1840 and made in England.  Micromosaics were the perfect souvenier for the traveller to bring home from Rome, an important centre in the development of micromosaic, as they were small and affordable.  This souvenir could then be taken home, and either set into a piece of furniture or decorative box, or as in this case, turned into a piece of jewellery.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
