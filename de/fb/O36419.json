May 9; 1966. \nDear Mrs. Curtis; The doll recently purchased by you was brought to us by a Mrs. Robert Stephenson whose great grandmother on her mother's side had been lady in waiting to the Duchess of Kent; mother of Queen Victoria; and had been presented with the doll by the Duchess. The relationship is as follows:- Mrs. Stephenson; n\u00e9e Clark Her mother: Mrs. Clark; n\u00e9e Bent Her grandmother: Mrs. Bent; n\u00e9e Straight Her great grandmother: Mrs. Straight; n\u00e9e Wright-Lady in waiting to The Duchess of Kent. Yours sincerely; T M Hutley.\n4-6. three page letter form Mrs. Robert D Magann; 2115 Barclay Road; Richmond; Virginai 23228; dated March 6th;'68 and addressed to Mrs Colin Curtis; Waldorf Astoria Hotel; Park Ave. New York; N Y (Junior League rooms). \nDear Peggy Since this doll came from the British Royal family with papers of authentication; I feel strongly that she should be left as she is. Use a small glass dome to protect her. The overskirt of English embroidery with open work fillings needs to be cleaned in order to preserve it. Heat and dust are the most destructive agents to old fabrics. However; in this case; the fabric is probably secondary to the doll as a whole. I stand in fear of altering its historic value; by snipping threads. If someday; you take it to a reputable museum; as you plan and they have an opinion contrary to mine; I'll clean it for you with great care. The head dress? Who Knows? A turban of 1800; or a wig of wool; or flax? Better\nto dream and wonder than to replace the wrong thing. The string about the neck makes me think it may have been played with; marionette fashion; or `dangled' in a doll house. She may have had an ornament around her neck at one time; as there is a wide `pink' strip there that doesn't match her ivory complexion above and below it. I have carefully cleaned the face with toothpicks and cotton dampened with distilled water. The features stand out quite clearly. Antique dirt has no value whatever; when it can be removed without damage being done. Look at her with a strong magnifying glass. I think that you are going to  appreciate her more as time goes by. All good wishes Katherine M.",
