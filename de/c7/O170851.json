Its two owners were both painters: Wilhelm S\u00fcs had set up a ceramic studio at Kronberg for the manufacture of majolica in Italian renaissance style, while Hans Thoma had started ceramic production in 1895.  The Karlsruhe venture was financed by Grand Duke Friedrich I of Baden. With a new business manager from 1908 production became more ambitious and escalated.  As well as smaller ornamental wares such as this table centre, they made large scale architectural wares for parks, gardens and cemeteries.  New premises were opened in Hartwald and teams of designers were employed including  the prolific Max Laueger who made wares there under his own name. In 1927, threatened with financial collapse, the factory came under state ownership as Staalkiche Majolika-Manufaktur Karlsruhe AG. Designs such as this, probably by Wilhelm S\u00fcs, owed much to the style of the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte, especialy Michael Powolny.",
