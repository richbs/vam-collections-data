The designs resemble those on the walls of a famous group of offering shrines erected between AD 147 and 168 in front of tombs of the aristocratic Wu family. The sculpture was probably mass-produced from a workshop in the area. So far only one of the figures on the V&A slab has been identified, at the left of the middle register. He is Qu Boyu, one of the disciples of Confucius. The Shandong peninsula was where Confucius had lived and taught, and the aristocracy of this region were proud of their special role as guardians of his legacy.",
