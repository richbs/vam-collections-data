However, the congratulatory clapping hands reproduced here, on a vast scale, are at once amusing, sinister and bewildering. They seem to address the inhabitant directly, suggesting that, even in the privacy of our own domestic space, we are constantly the subject of judgement, even if only our own.  The two different images of  the hands  alternate down the length of the paper, rather like a film strip. This may be deliberate as Boyce has said that the Judy Garland film A Star is Born was a source of inspiration.  Film can capture us, without our being aware and then disturbingly, play us back to ourselves, suggesting both surveillance and vulnerability.\n\nWallpaper has often featured in Boyce's paintings, and since this first paper, she has made several more, including the embossed papers which make up Lover's Rock, also in the V&A collection.",
