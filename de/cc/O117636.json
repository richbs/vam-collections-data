NB: Evidence of uneven tension visible on back down spine of carpet.\n\nWEFT: red and white wool; red Z5S; white Z2S; a minimum of 1 shoot after each row of knots.  NB. There may be additional, concealed wefts.  The good condition of the carpet precludes further investigation.  There are 9-11 knots per inch (34-42 per dm).\n\nPILE: wool; 10 colours: red, light red, yellow, olive green, green, light green, dark blue, blue, brown, white; asymmetrical knot open to the left and tied around 2 warp threads; 100 (average) knots per sq. inch (1406 [average] per sq. dm).\n\nSIDE FINISH: one stout cord of 6 (left hand side) and 8 (right hand side) warp threads of white and dark brown ply and of 2 white cotton threads all oversewn with alternating red and green wool which on the centre of the right hand side has been cut.\n\nEND FINISH: lower: 2 cms. plain weave with white wool ending in a 3 cms. fringe with the same weft thread securing 4 warp threads by twining.  From fringe to pile are 4 rows of weft wrapping in a) dark blue and yellow, b) green and red, and c) red and light blue.  Upper 1.5 cms. as above with 4 rows of weft wrapping: a) green and red, b) yellow and light blue, and c) red and light blue.\n\nDESIGN: Field: dark blue ground within crenellated frame of red, then green, then dark blue.  A central, similarly stepped medallion extends to form a cross; in the medallion, above and below a horizontal, mirrored blue motif is a yellow flowering sprig.  The vertical line is extended beyond the medallion by two white palmettes.  Spaced up the field are four pairs of inward-facing birds in red, outlined in white and two pairs of stylised, long green animal figures bearing a yellow figure.  Elsewhere are scattered two-headed birds, small stars and flowerheads.  The design is directional.  Each 'bay' between the field frame and the inner border contains a two-coloured flowerhead.\n\nMain border: red ground with narrow yellow or green botehs; blue, yellow or white decorated crosses; dark blue crosses outlined in white; small, dark blue 'S' motifs; and groups of tiny, coloured diagonal knots along both border edges.\n\nInner and outer borders: dark blue ground with red meander bearing red and white flowers.\n\nBelow and above outer border is a narrow band with dark blue ground framing a line of alternating white and blue small rectangles each containing a floret.",
