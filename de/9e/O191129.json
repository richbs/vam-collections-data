It is an Alliance of Young Democrats campaign poster for the first free elections in Hungary following the collapse of communism. It tells the viewer which Budapest electoral district the candidate, Dr. Viktor Orb\u00e1n, stands for and where and when he will hold his first electoral assembly (February 1990). The caption to the photograph identifies Orb\u00e1n as the bold orator who spoke at the re-burial ceremony for the victims of the 1956 revolution on the Heroes Square in Budapest on the 16th June, 1989. This event was an important stage on the road to political transition in Hungary. The 1956 revolt against the communist regime, when Hungary tried to gain independence from the Soviet Union, is an internationally well known chapter in Hungarian History. During the K\u00e1d\u00e1r-regime that followed the suppression of the revolution, the events of 1956 were officially denounced as counter-revolutionary. Open debate about 1956 was only made possible by the strengthening of the political opposition at the end of the 1980s.  In his famous speech, Viktor Orb\u00e1n called for the endeavours of 1956 to be fulfilled. The text above the photograph of Orb\u00e1n reads: \u2018After 40 years we ourselves can decide about our own fate\u2019.\n\nIn addition to these references, the effect of the poster is based on the popularity of an energetic, young and at the same time well qualified politician.",
