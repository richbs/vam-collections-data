The same cloud resist painted design as the firemans's jacket (FE.107-1982) appears on the inside and the tie-ups bear a small-scale horizontal and vertical band motif like the lower coat section.\nThe hood consists of two sections of material seamed over the top of the crown. The rear part of the crown is extended down to form a flap for protecting the back of the neck. The front crown also extends down to form two flaps which protect the face and fasten together just below eye level with a button and button hole. There are two tapering cotton ties, 8cm wide at their widest point, attached to the main part of the hood at ear level. These ties are not quilted. A twisted thread loop is sewn to the top of the crown.",

It is made from several layers of thick cotton quilted together together using a technique called 'sashiko'.  Before tackling a blaze the fireman would have been drenched in water to protect him from the flames, the layers of cloth allowing for maximum absorption.  The hood has long flaps to cover the back of the neck and the crown is heavily padded to protect the fireman from falling debris.",
