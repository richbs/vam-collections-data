In 1969, Ihnatowicz received a commission from Philips, one of the world's largest electronics companies, and created 'The Senster', a 15 feet long by 8 feet high, hydraulic robot.  Using sound and movement sensors, 'The Senster' was able to react to the behaviour of those around it, and was one of the first interactive robotic works of its kind.  \n\nLike many artists working with computer technologies at this time, Ihnatowicz combined his interest in art and science by working as a research assistant in the department of Mechanical Engineering at University College, London, from 1971 until 1986.",
