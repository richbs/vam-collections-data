After working as a domestic servant, he became the pupil of Abraham Pether, whose style he at first closely imitated. Exhibited 176 works, mostly landscapes, at the RA between 1788 and 1841, and 63 at the BI 1807-42. Elected ARA 1810, and won the BI prize 1825 for his 'Battle of the Nile' (National Maritime Museum). His work was engraved in <i>The Border Antiquities of England and Scotland</i>(1814). Grant (OELP) believed his masterpiece to be 'The Castle of Gloom' (RA 1814); it is shown in the background of his self-portrait (NPG). Died Pentonville, London, 21 November 1841; his son and daughter were also exhibiting artists. \n\n<b>Landscape</b>  \n804-1904 Neg HF952 \nPanel, 15.2 X 33 cm (6 X 13 ins) \nSigned and dated 'Arnald/1826' br \nGiven by W S Terry 1904 \n\nThe painting is not identifiable with any exhibited work.\"",
