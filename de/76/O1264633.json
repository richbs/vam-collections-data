She has said she is interested \u201cin the paradoxical desire to seek beauty within the natural environment and then promptly alter it by creating one\u2019s own version; to hold a lasting possession of a place by imposing one\u2019s description, thoughts or ideals. She works with what she has described as \u201cthe omnipresent legacy of the English landscape tradition\u201d, and favours quiet overlooked places, which she represents in intimate oil paintings which look distinctly old-fashioned. Her work constructs a generic \u2018English landscape\u2019 and explores the visual clich\u00e9 of the \u201cgreen and pleasant land.\u201d Though each work looks like an honest transcription of a particular place, the view is edited radically \u2013 people, and buildings are edited out, trees and other landscape may be added, and a grey sky often substituted for blue. The direction of the light may also be manipulated. The view is invariably \u2018framed\u2019 by a distancing device \u2013 here a Claude glass, but otherwise often a train window or car windscreen. Brown \u2018frames\u2019 her view here with the aid of a Claude glass, a process of looking which subtly abstracts the subject from reality and from its surroundings. \n\nThe print is also of technical interest. It is a complex screenprint achieved using a four-colour Benday dot system (originally a commercial process developed in the 19th century to give depth and shading to magazine illustrations and later, comics; popularised as a signature style by Roy Lichtenstein), followed by a fifth layer of yellow and then a final layer of varnish, together intended to enhance the effect of a reflection as seen in a Claude glass.",
