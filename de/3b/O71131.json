Bareilly furniture-makers produced objects in a variety of different decorative finishes, causing some confusion for future generations trying to determine their place of manufacture. This chest on stand is of a type made in a variety of different colours and styles, some of which, like this one, incorporated conventional western-style floral motifs and others that were directly inspired by lacquer designs on Chinese export furniture. Until recently, examples of this type have been commonly misidentified as having been made in Canton (Guangzhou) in south-eastern China.",
