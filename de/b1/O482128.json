The artist established the Fine Arts Department at the University of Balochistan and headed the department for three years. In 1985 he formed the Artists Association of Balochistan and became the first Chairman of Artists Association of Pakistan. Jamal obtained a Master's in English Literature from Balochistan University in 1978. He later obtained a Masters in Fine Arts from the Slade School of Art, London.\n\nIn this coloured etching the artist has represented two nude male figures on mutilated wooden horses riding in a merry go round. Below on the left, is a geometric diagram representing the game 'Qitar'. The artist has suggested that the work represents 'hope' in the face of aimless despair.",
