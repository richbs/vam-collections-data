It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years. Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn\u2019t needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nSinger Max Bygraves started out performing in Air Force concerts but got his break in 1951 when he was a supporting act to Judy Garland at the London Palladium.  He became a well-known entertainer on stage and television in the 1950s and was awarded thirty one gold discs as well as appearing in films.",
