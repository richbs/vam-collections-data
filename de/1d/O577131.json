            "public_access_description": "This is one of a series of eighteen lithographs created in Paris in about 1910 by a French artist who signs himself \"Laviny\". Their subject matter is of beautiful women dressed in fantastical and extraordinary costumes which represent various aspects of Paris. Whilst the outfits are ultra-fashionable in silhouette, they are very exaggerated and were probably not intended to be made up in real-life, but were made to amuse and for decorative purposes. The lithographs were printed by Fattorini et Crespin of Paris.\n\nThis design represents the Bois de Boulogne, a park located along the western edge of the 16th arrondissement of Paris. The crown of the hat is encircled with assorted birds in various colours, shaded by large green-dyed ostrich plumes. These could well have been real stuffed birds, as feathers and bird's wings were extremely popular ornaments for millinery at the time, and many species of birds suffered as a result of the demand for exotic plumes for hat-trimmings. In the United Kingdom, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds was founded in 1889 by Emily Williamson as a group of women specifically protesting the use of feathers and skins from endangered birds in fashion. The two basic rules for members in 1899 were that lady members should refrain from wearing feathers of birds not killed for food purposes, other than those of the ostrich; and that all members should discourage the wanton destruction of birds and interest themselves in their protection.",
