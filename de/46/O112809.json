He was born in Hereford and came to London in 1737 to work as a wine merchant but made his London debut as an actor in 1741 at Goodman's Fields Theatre as Richard III.. He managed the Theatre Royal Drury Lane from 1747 until 1776 and was depicted during his lifetime in many of his most famous roles, especially in paintings by Johann Zoffany (1733-1810). Richard III was a role with which he was especially associated, both from his London debut and his first appearance as Richard at Drury Lane Theatre on 11 May 1742.\n\nThe makers of jugs such as these in the late 18th century would frequently use prints of actors and actresses on their wares and find an eager market from fans of the performers portrayed.",
