Along the length of the belt are 13 mounts which are attached to the belt by means of two loops on the back of each.  Seven of these mounts are dome-shaped, made of six openwork cast leaves resting on a ring of striated wire and joined together at the top by a plain dome with six loops, which may originally have held small pendants.  These domed mounts alternate with six rectangular mounts which consist of an arched pierced frame, like a cloche for plants, with vegetal decoration.  There is a tongue-shaped belt end at one end of the belt, which matches the rectangular mounts on its front, and which has an engraved floral design on the back.  At the other end of the belt is a plate, which originally had the same frontal decoration as the belt end, with a plain back.  The buckle is attached to this plate by a hinge.  The buckle is wider than the belt, and consists of a D-shaped frame with a plain bar and a broad crescent of openwork clipped floral decoration, and a plain tongue with heavy scrolls at its base.",

These belts were usually based on the kind worn by the upper classes in late medieval and renaissance times.  \n\nThis belt was described as 17th century Norwegian when it was acquired by the Museum in 1899.  The fittings were mounted on \u2018velvet supplied by the Art Work Room of the South Kensington Museum\u2019 and there is no information about the original appearance of the belt, or its construction.  While the buckle and mounts are probably from the Nordic region, the way they are now mounted is not typical of Norwegian marriage belts.  The original belt would more probably have had trimmings of metallic thread along its edges, and might have been wider, and the two different sets of mounts would have been grouped together, rather than alternating.  It is also possible that the rectangular mounts might have been placed at right angles to the belt, rather than along it as at present.",
