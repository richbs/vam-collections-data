Such a task was obviously made easier if the same manufacturer made both board and bread knife, so Cole showed Bell's plaster model to Joseph Rodgers & Son, the cutlery manufacturers of Sheffield. They produced a version which they said would have to retail at the uncommercial price of \u00a34 4s (\u00a34.20). By having another board made in London, Cole demonstrated that the design could be made and retailed for \u00a33 3s (\u00a33.15). The second attempt by Rodgers produced a board that could be sold for \u00a32 2s (\u00a32.10). This example of board and bread knife was bought from Rodgers in 1865 for \u00a31 16s (\u00a31.80) .\n\nMaterials\nThis design was also available in porcelain at various prices, made by Minton & Co., and could also be fitted with an electro-plated rim, made by Benjamin Smith, a London silversmith. Examples of all three types were shown in the Exhibition of Recent British Manufactures organised by Cole at the Royal Society of Arts, London, in 1848.",
