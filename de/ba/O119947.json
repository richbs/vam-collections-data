The grotesque style originated in Italy in the decades around 1500 and was inspired by a revival of a type of decoration found in the excavated palace of the Roman emperor Nero. \n\nItalian grotesque prints first appeared at the beginning of the sixteenth century and spread the style across Europe. This print was one of a set of fifteen variations on the theme published in Antwerp, a very significant centre of print publishing from the 1540s to the 1580s.",
