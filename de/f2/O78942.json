Wrought iron was mainly used for railings, gates and window frames.  Most garden furniture of this date and earlier was wooden and has not survived, but can be seen in illustrations. After 1830 cast iron was commonly used for garden furniture.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe crude method of construction suggests that the chair was made by a rural blacksmith, probably the result of an individual commission. The iron rods are standard sizes, riveted and welded together. It was originally painted to prevent rusting, but was already stripped when the V&A acquired it. Microscopic examination of tiny remnants of paint have shown that the chair was originally painted green, and was repainted 20 times, each colour change comprising up to three layers of paint. This chair must have been kept under cover to have survived so long.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe back of the chair has a pointed arch design with three lancets and quatrefoil, or four-lobed shape.  This simple curving design was ideally suited to wrought iron.  It was probably taken from a window design in a wrought iron pattern book.  Gothic windows with pointed arches, inspired by those in medieval churches, were thought suitable for chapels and garden summer-houses.",
