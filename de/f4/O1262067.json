Its five week tour was such a success that a second tour, starting at the Edinburgh Festival, was followed by a sell-out London run. It established McKellen as a leading actor. Prospect was a small company with a limited funds. The set for Richard II was  basic, and designer Tim Goodchild spent most of his minuscule budget on costume. This tabard for King Richard is typically late 1960s in design and making. Based on medieval heraldry, it looks suitably historical but is actually made up of a collage of modern materials. The basic fabric is furnishing brocade.",
