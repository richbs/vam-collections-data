The initial is drawn in red outline and sits against a background of blocks of pink, blue and green with no outlines. The D terminates at the top left with a bird drawn in red outline against a green background, extending into the margin. The initial is 18 lines high.\n\nThe pricking for 60 lines in a single column is visible down the left hand side of the page with double binding lines for the text area which extend to the edges of the folio. The musical notation is on a four line staff, underlaid with text which is in Textualis script in dark brown-black ink. The musical notation is written to single staff line height of approximately 5mm. Every second and fourth line is ruled alternately yellow and red. The remaining text, on lines ruled in light brown ink, takes up space approximately equivalent to two staff lines. There is some rubrication. In the lower central margin of side that includes the historiated initial is a quire signature .vii. which is contemporary with the script and decoration on the leaf. This signature appears on the hair side of the parchment. Signatures on the top left of the recto and verso of the leaf are later.  \n\nThere is more text and music on the reverses side of the parchment including rubrics before the larger red initials. One 7-line initial D, five 5-line intials, C, O, I, V, and D, the C and D in black, the V in red and black, and one 3-line initial D.",

Medieval books had no contents page or index and so there was usually a hierarchy of initials marking important divisions in the text or music. The most important initials might be historiated with a figurative picture (istoire being the term for a story) or with decoration. Sometimes, as in this one, they might include depictions of people associated with the book such as a patron. \n\nAn Antiphoner was a choirbook which contained the sung part of the Divine Office, the daily devotions performed by clergy or the religious orders and split into the eight canonical 'hours' of the day. Antiphoners were often large so that they could be used by a whole choir.",
