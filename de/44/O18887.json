Its blade is of jade mounted on a bronze handle, and in the shape of a bird's head with a long curled beak and upturned tail. The dagger axe was mounted at right angles to a long wooden pole, and was the main weapon of war during the Shang dynasty (1766\u20131122 BC). The fragile jade blade of this example suggests that its use was restricted to ceremonial purposes. Dagger axes and other objects made of bronze and jade were often buried with the deceased.",
