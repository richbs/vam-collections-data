This image is an early experiment with screenprint, a medium that became central to his work. He and other artists working in the 1960s used it as a primary artist's medium, raising its status to equal that of painting and sculpture. Both his sculpture and printmaking in the early 1950s frequently reflected the idea of man as machine.",

He made many more brilliant images in the 1960s, a decade when printmaking became a primary artists' medium, thanks largely to the encouraging lead given by those artists who were making screenprints with Prater.  The latter's blend of skill and imagination seems to have had a magical effect on all those who worked with him.  <i>Automobile Head</i>, conceived in the 1950s (the V&A's print is dated 1957 and screenprinted by the artist himself), has a certain historic significance in that in 1962 it was the first image Paolozzi handed to Prater to work on; the printer then made a new screen based on the original collage.  This marked the beginning of a long and very fruitful relationship. \nScreenprinting's commercial roots lent it a kind of aesthetic integrity when it came to engaging with industrial production and mass media, both of which fascinated Paolozzi.  From 1949 to 1955 Paolozzi was teaching in the Textiles Department of the Central School of Art and Design, London, where he was shown the screenprint technique by an Austrian \u00e9migr\u00e9 technician.  Francis Carr, credited with making the first artist's screenprint in Britain in 1949, also taught Paolozzi for a short while.  Paolozzi's friendship with Nigel Henderson would have given him a special insight into photography, an art integral to modern screen processes.  From at least 1951 Paolozzi wan in the habit of making screenprints, cutting them up and re-cycling them as collage.  At the same time he was making collages and drawings, often mixing the tow and using them as the basic material for his prints. \n<i>Automobile Head</i>, created from a collage of machine parts taken from a motor catalogue, was acquired by the V&A along with another impression dated 1958.  The later one is printed through a screen soaked in turpentine, which caused ink to 'flood' and so make a darker, blurred image.  As part of the same purchase, the V&A also acquired three other prints of a standing figure, similarly processed, with two different variations on the treated screen.  This little group, typical of Paolozzi's graphic production of the mid-1950s and closely allied to his sculptural projects, represents his fascination with variations on a single image, something that became an enduring theme in his work.\"",
