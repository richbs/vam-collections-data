He has photographed the people who in England today seem glamorous to him. Some of them happen to be famous - John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Michk Hagger, Hean Shrimpton, Lord Snodon, Cecil Beaton, Nureyev. Others operate behind the scenes - film producers, art directors, advertising executives, designers, photographers, nightclub owners. Surprisingly few are female - Bailey's standards here are so rigorous that only four girls qualify, all of whom are professional models. But in the age of Mick Jagger, it is the boys who are the pin-ups: and Bailey's pictures give them all the inward, self-sufficient look of Narcissus. Although most of his subjects belong to Bailey's own world of fashion, pop music and the Ad Lib, he did not choose them to represent a social set. He chose them because, to his private vision, they share a quality - something of the throwaway elegance he associates with his idol, Fred Astaire. Yet, together, these thirty-six photographs make a statement not only about the man who took them, but also about London life in 1965. Many of the people here have gone all out for the immediate rewards of success: quick money, quick fame, quick sex - a brave thing to do. Glamour dates fast, and it is its ephemeral nature which both attracts Bailey and challenges him. He has tried to capture it on the wing, and his pin-ups have a heroic look: isolated, invulnerable, lost.",

He published 'David Bailey's box of pin-ups' in 1965 as a loose portfolio of 36 portraits of the mainly-male fashionable elite that, as the cover description states, 'belong to Bailey's own world of fashion, pop music and the Ad Lib [nightclub]'. Surprisingly, only four of the pin-ups are women, all of whom are models. As the notes explain, 'in the age of Mick Jagger, it is the boys who are the pin-ups'. \nThe portraits constitute a celebration of the growing celebrity culture of the Sixties, and many of them have become the definitive images of key figures of cultural life in London during the Swinging Sixties.",
