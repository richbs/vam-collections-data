This example of cylindrical form has three compartments to contain the three holy oils each engraved with the appropriate letter of the alphabet on the side. The uppermost compartment is engraved with the letter I for 'oleum Infirmorum' which was used to anoint the sick; the next bears a B for 'oleum catachumenorum' used to anoint those being baptised and the third bears the letter C for 'Chrisma' which was used for confirmation, ordination and consecration. The floreated initials on the upper lid MPG record the identity of the original owner. Apart from the initials identifying the different oils, the chrismatory is unmarked to protect the identification of the maker. It dates from the late 18th century or early 19th century before Catholic Emancipation in 1829.\n\nHistorical significance: The Catholic plate that survives from before the 1660s is mainly limited to chalices, paxes and pyxes. These earlier pieces are rarely marked. After 1688 Catholic plate was more often hallmarked and the range of forms expanded to include sanctuary lamps, cruets and incense boats. In London Catholics could worship openly in foreign embassy chapels. This chrismatory is a rare survival of an essential accessory for the administration of the Catholic sacraments of baptism, confirmation and ordination.",
