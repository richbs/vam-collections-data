            "history_note": "\"La Voliere\" with choreography by Fanny Elssler's sister, Therese, was produced at the Paris Opera in 1838 to a scenario by Eug\u00e8ne Scribe as a vehicle for the two sisters.  \nZoe is kept from a knowledge of men by her jilted sister; told that a young man is a bird, she entices him into a birdcage (the voli\u00e8re of the title), but in the end love triumphs.  The ballet was not a success, but Fanny's performance as the innocent Zoe was memorable enough to be preserved in this magnificent lithograph, one of the few prints of the period to show a dancer 'in action' and with a vitality unsurpassed in the Romantic Ballet print canon. Although the print was published in London, \"La Voli\u00e8re\" was never performed there.  \nThe print is pendant to the lithograph of Taglioni in \"Le Dieu et la Bayadere\" also published in 1838.   \nThe word \"Proof\", formally printed on many English prints, related to a peculiarly English convention among printmakers.   It did not mean a test pull of the print; because lithographs could be issued in such large editions it was felt that they were of little worth, compared to engravings, so the practice developed of titling some of the early pulls as \"Proof\" and selling them at a premium.   The marking was no indication of quality, as later prints from the same stone could be as fine, if not finer.  \nThe print came to the Museum as part of the Cyril Beaumont Bequest.  \nIn the 19th century, the edges of prints were often left to be folded over card or stretcher before framing.  The print was originally folded over a stretcher and the corners removed to reduce bulk.",
