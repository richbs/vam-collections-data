Full length shaped cloak of black cotton and gold tinsel brocatelle in fish scale pattern; on the main body the fish scale motif is outlined in pale blue paint. Most of the gold tinsel is worn away. At the centre back, broadening out from the neck to hem, is a strip of pale blue and silver tinsel cloth. The long slit armholes are bordered with bands of pale blue and silver tinsel cloth, which continue below the armhole to link to a broader band which forms a facing up the front edges of the cloak.\nThe cape collar over the fitted shoulders is formed of overlapping layers of graduated \"leaves\" of orange brown cotton shaped with black dye and gold paint, the centre of each leaf having a narrow spine of gold tinsel ribbon. Around the lower third of the cloak are similar, longer orange brown cotton \"leaves\" shaded with black dye and gold paint, the centre of each having a narrow spine of gold tinsel ribbon; on the top two layers, each small leaf is decorated with a plastic turquoise jewel.\nOn each lower front facing is a large applique gold tissue motif, studded with blue plastic jewels; around the sleeve bands are small plastic turquoise jewels; down the front facings are larger turquoise jewels mounted on gold ribbon, alternating with blue plastic jewels.\nAt the front neck is a padded shape of black jersey painted and decorated with a loop of gold Russia braid and a large plastic jewel.  Concealed under this is a large hook and bar fastening.  The cloak is lined with shot black and gold artificial silk.",
