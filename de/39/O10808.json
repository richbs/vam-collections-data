It was used to contain the Great Seal, which symbolised the majesty of the law in the same way that the crown symbolises the monarchy.\n\nRoyalty\nElizabeth I had five chancellors during her reign (1558-1603), each with a different burse for the Great Seal.\n\n Historical Associations\nOn 29 April 1587 the Queen appointed the Vice Chamberlain Sir Christopher Hatton as Lord Chancellor. While staying at the Archbishop of Canterbury's Palace at Croydon, she delivered the Seal in its velvet bag to Hatton, asked him to seal a writ of subpoena (a summons) with it and then declared that he was to hold it as Lord Chancellor. He died four years later at his London house, in the area now known as Hatton Garden.",
