In 1888 he became a publisher in his own right with offices at 24 St. Bride Street, London. He appointed the writer and editor, Robert Ellice Mack, as director. \n\nNister specialised in high quality colour printing for children in the last quarter of the 19th century. Movable books with various mechanisms became his speciality after 1890 (when be published his first stand-up book) but he also produced numerous picture books, annuals, poetry, nursery rhymes, calendars and greetings cards. He worked with a core of writers, including Clifton Bingham and Robert Ellice Mack, and illustrators such as Eveline Lance, Harriett M. Bennett, Edith A. Cubitt and Rosa Petherick. \n\nEddie J. Andrews produced this illustration of Beauty and the Beast ca.1892 for A Long Time Ago: a collection of favourite stories retold by Mrs. Oscar Wilde and others, illustrated by Eddie J. Andrews and R.A. Bell and published by Ernest Nister. The illustration also appears in another Nister publication, Picture House; with ever so many stories.",
