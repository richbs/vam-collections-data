She would have been influenced by the many Victorian morality stories of the time, such as Jessica's First Prayer by Hesba Stretton, a pseudonym for Sarah Smith (1832-1911). One such book features on the cover of this story. J Cole by Emma Gellibrand was probably first published in London by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge in the 1880s while several later publications appeared in the United States. \n\nThe picture of the young boy on the front of this story must be taken from a cover illustration of J Cole, who is described in Gellibrand's book thus - \"In one hand he held a bundle, tied in a red handkerchief, and in the other a bunch of wild-flowers that bore signs of having travelled far in the heat of the sun, their blossoms hanging down, dusty and fading, and their petals dropping one by one on the ground\".",
