Ames, <i>Italian drawings from the 15th to the 18th century</i>, 1964, pl. 79 It is a study for the page bearing the Doge's train in the painting 'The Doge Ziani taking leave of Pope Alexander III' in the Sala del Consiglio dei Dieci in the Ducal Palace, Venice. An old attribution assigned the drawing to Jacopo Bassano, but it was catalogued under school of Titian by Reitlinger. Russell first pointed out its connection with the painting, which was begun by Francesco Bassano in 1592 and finished after his death by his brother Leandro. Russell attributed the drawing to Leandro, and this opinion is supported by von Hadeln and by Arslan in his first book. Dr and Mrs Tietze, on the other hand, ascribe the drawing to Francesco on grounds of style, and this is the opinion of Arslan in his second book. The Tietzes refer to another drawing in the Koenigs Collection which represents the same page as well as his companion; but this they regard as a sketch made after the painting.",
