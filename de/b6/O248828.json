These were the Art of War tapestries which Mr Finney had collected from different sources. Among his seven purchases were five Art of War tapestries from one of the leading sets of this series, made by Judocus de Vos for Augustus the Strong of Saxony, an opponent of the Duke of Marlborough in the War of the Spanish Succession who, by a quirk of fate, purchased around 1718-20 a set of tapestries which included the figures of Marlborough and his officers at their moment of greatest triumph winning the Battle of Blenheim. The five tapestries which Mr Finney purchased from the Saxony set included the subjects of The March, The Siege, The Ambush, The Camp, and Cutting Fascines. To these he added two more pieces from the same set of cartoons, though not from the same set, Pillage and The Halt. Besides their importance as an appreciable augmentation of our early 18th century Brussels tapestries, these pieces give a fascinating picture of warfare and campaigning at the time of the War of the Spanish Succession.\nAll seven tapestries were displayed in 1973-75, and five featured in an exhibition entitled War and Peace in 1977, and were shown again in the following year. Unfortunately lack of space in this exhibition prevents the present display of more than two piece, for the proportions of this magnificaent gift would exclude most of the other exhibits."

They were reviewed and their order largely established in a fundamental work by the late Alan Wace [see ref], a study first made in the 1930s, [which] was prepared for publication by Mrs Helen Wace and published by the Phaidon Press in 1968. Four years later a magnificent gift of seven Art of War tapestries was made to the Victoria and Albert Museum by Mrs Josa Finney in memory of her husband Oswald James Finney. These tapestries were mentioned in Wace's book, p.108, among the surviving sets of the second Art of War series, but could not be examined there in detail owing to the sequestration of the tapestries in Egypt and lack of photographs.\"\nWace, Alan, <u>The Marlborough Tapestries at Blenheim Palace</u> (Phaidon, 1968)\n(from p.108, Other Sets, no. XII) : In Alexandria, Egypt, in the private collection of Mrs Oswald Finney, is a group of six panels which belong to this general series and bear certain resemblances to the Dresden set of Augustus the Strong ( no. 1 above). They consist of : Campement ii, Fachinade ii, Embuscade ii, Pillage ii, La Marche ii, and Attacque (influenced by the Blenheim Oudenarde). These all have trophy borders. With them is La Halte, which originally had a picture-frame border and belonged to another set.\n\n(from p.103, Other Sets, no. I : At the Royal Palace in Dresden, before the First World War, there was a set of five, acquired by Augustus the Strong, King of Saxony, with whom Marlborough had some dealings. Saxon troops, in fact, fought at Malplaquet, but not at Blenheim. These tapestries were sold in 1926 to the firm of Magraf, in Berlin.

            "history_note": "Mrs Finney first offered the group of seven Art of War tapestries to the museum, in memory of her husband, Oswald J Finney,  in April 1962.  They were then under sequestration in Alexandria (Mrs Finney was resident in Rome). The tapestries were released and sent to Rome in 1971. They were received by the Museum in July 1972.\n\nThe tapestries had been purchased by Mr Finney for his house in Alexandria some time in the late 1920s or 1930s. Mrs Finney remembered that her husband became interested in the tapestries when some of them were shown at an exhibition in America, and that a dealer in Paris was commissioned to acquire them. Hefford explains that the seven Finney tapestries appear to have been acquired in at least five separate transactions.\n\nThe first 'Art of War' series was designed by the tapestry cartoon painter Lambert de Hondt and woven in the Brussels workshops of Jerome Le Clerc and Gaspar van der Borght.  This tapestry is from the second series woven by de Vos and probably designed by Philipp de Hondt.  Some sets of the second series include scenes and figures borrowed from the cartoons of the Marlborough Victories at Blenheim Palace. \n\nFive of the 'Art of War' tapestries belonging to Mr Finney are believed to be from the set of the second Art of War which was made for Augustus the Strong of Saxony, and was formerly at Dresden. Hefford sets out in detail the justification for this attribution.   'The March', 'The Camp' and 'Cutting Fascines' were illustrated in Ackerman's publication on the Dresden tapestries in 1926.  'The Siege' and 'The Ambush', not known to Ackerman, appear to be part of the same set, which is noted in the Marillier tapestry catalogue, anecdotally quoting Bernheimer, to have been of eight pieces.  Of the two further pieces from Dresden illustrated by Ackerman, 'The Halt' is now in the National Museum, Warsaw, and the tapestry after 'Blenheim' was sold at Sotheby's, London, in 1964. It is now in the Toms collection, Lausanne. The eighth, missing piece may have been similar to Marlborough's tapestry of 'Malplaquet' for the Dresden set was known as 'Die Schlachten bei H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt und Malplaquet'.",

He later owned another series of tapestries depicting military scenes, this time his own victories in the War of the Spanish Succession. The relationship between them and a second version of the Art of War series was the subject of an important study by Alan Wace,  incorporating research carried out in the 1930s, but published posthumously in 1968. Following the gift to the V&A of seven Art of War tapestries in 1972 from Mrs Josa Finney, Wendy Hefford undertook further research on the design and relationship between the different series, published in 1975 (see bibliography) .",
