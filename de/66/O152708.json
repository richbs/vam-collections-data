It would have been worn, with a black raffia costume, at important civic events such as the visit of an important dignitary or the coronation or funeral of an important chief. It is particularly associated with girls' initiation ceremonies and is unique in Africa in being owned and worn, if not made, by women.\n\nSande masks are usually made of lightweight bombax wood, smoothed down with the rough leaves of the ficus tree before being dyed black. A rich glossy surface is achieved by rubbing the mask with palm oil or shoe polish. Although masks such as this are not often used today, the Sande society continues to play an important role in championing women's social and political interests.",
