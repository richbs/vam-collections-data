Section through \nthe centre of the house from north to south \nshowing the entrance hall, circular staircase, \nupper landing and coffered dome supported \non Corinthian columns. c. 1768 \nInscribed with scale. \nPen and ink and water-colour. \n59.7 x 47.9 cm \nVAM 8416.3 \n \n Paine was commissioned by Henry, 8th Lord \nArundell of Wardour, to design a new and  \nimposing mansion in the grounds of Wardour \nPark, so that the family could re-establish itself \nthere, on the site of the ancestral domain, in a  \nmanner befitting its recently acquired wealth. \nBuilding was begun in 1768 and completed in \n1776. \n \nThis is a finished drawing, one of many  \nwhich the architect would have prepared for \nLord Arundell to show him his proposed plans \nclearly and attractively. A section of the house \nfrom south to north is reproduced in <i>Plans, \nElevations, and Sections of Noblemen and \nGentelemen\u2019s </i>[sic]<i> Houses\u2026</i> by James Paine, \nvol. 2, published London, 1783.\u2019",
