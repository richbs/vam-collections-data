TESTA, PIETRO <i>called</i> il Lucchesino (1611-50) 812 A pair of angels flying Inscribed in pencil in an old hand 'P: Testa'; on the back a draft of a letter; inscribed on the mount in an 18th or early 19th century hand 'Pietro Testa' Black chalk, touched in parts with pen and ink 6 <sup>7/8</sup> X 9 <sup>1/8</sup> (174 x 232) D.I739-1885 PROVENANCE Bought 1885 The inscription on the back is part of a rough draft of a letter in the hand of Testa. There are many erasures and illegible words, and the right half of the sheet having been cut away, it is hard to guess at the general sense of the letter. The writer appears to be complaining about his hard fate. He mentions his brother, not by name, however, and Signor Gorbesi, who was a Lucchese patron of Testa, Miss Karin Hartmann informs me.",
