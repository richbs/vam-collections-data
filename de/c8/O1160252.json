These men are dressed in black and one wears a black half mask and is shown next to a dagger and pistol (both discarded on the ground beside him). There are two further puppets languishing in a box beside these shadowy puppeteers. There names are marked as O'Shea and O'Donnell. The names of the puppets appear to be Labby, Granville, Trevelyan, Gladstone, Harcourt, Herbert, Sir W Lawson, Bradlaugh and Morley. \n\nThe names of the puppets correspond with those of contemporary Members of Parliament and the caption below the image, 'Parnell's Puppets', seems to be a deliberate reference to Charles Stewart Parnell (1846-1891).  Parnell was an Irish Protestant landowner, nationalist political leader, land reform agitator, and the founder and leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party which he led through the period of Parliamentary nationalism in Ireland between 1875 and his death in 1891. O'Shea and O'Donnel were also Irish politicians.\n\nIt is part of the George Speaight Punch & Judy Collection.",
