The stand is set with a single drawer, the carcase of oak, dovetailed, and the sides cut with a rebate which engages with runners attached to the inside of the carcase. Immediately above this is a writing slide, which pulls out and rests on the top of the drawers when in use. The middle of the front of the slide is cut with a recess, through which the bolt of the lock on the inside of the drawer, engages with the underside of the top of the frame section. The interior of the desk, behind the solid roll-top, which is quarter round in section, is set with a framework at the back, containing six small drawers and three open pigeonholes. The fronts of the drawers are veneered with marquetry panels of flowers.The exterior of the desk is set on every panel with marquetry of flowers in baskets, those on the side panels standing on one edge of architectural plinths. The top surface of the writing slide is veneered with kingwood, with inset 'cleats' of veneer at either end, set with mitred joints, so that the veneer on the front edge is continuous. The centre of the slide shows a marquetry design of 6 flowers, their stems overlapping and with a single flower head at the point of intersection of the stems.\nThe main drawer is set with two lacquered brass handles, with pierced backplates, in neo-classical style, possibly added later.  Two small brass knobs serve to pull out the writing slide.",
