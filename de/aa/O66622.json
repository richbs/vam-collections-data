The epic story of a character based very loosely on the life of the uncle of the Prophet Muhammad chronicles the fantastic adventures of Hamza as he and his band of heroes fight against the enemies of Islam. The stories, from a long-established oral tradition, were written down in Persian, the language of the court, in multiple volumes. These originally had 1400 illustrations, of which fewer than 200 survive today. The only contemporary version of the text is that on the back of the remaining paintings, making it difficult to reconstruct the narrative. Work on the project probably began in about 1562 and took 15 years to complete.\nThis illustration appears to be a continuation of the conflict between Hamza's heroes and the unbelievers, who in this episode are fire-worshippers. Hamza's spy Tayir enters a fort where Fazlan Shah is chained, and releases him.",
