The interior would be divided into compartments for hair dye and bleach, toilet accessories such as a scriminal (an instrument for parting the hair), combs, brushes, handkerchiefs, or sponzarol (sponge saucers used for cosmetics). Such caskets are often depicted in scenes of the goddess Venus at her toilette. \n\nThe distinctive style of decoration uses moresques or tight scrolls, executed in gold, in combination with mother-of-pearl plaques. This may have been what was referred to by Italians variously as frissi grottesche- grotesque friezes, alla zemina- in the Persian manner, or petteniera turchesca- in the Turkish manner. It seems to have been a speciality of Venice, developed during the sixteenth-century, and probably imitated the Persian lacquer imported through the port city. It was used for luxury objects but also for the covers of government documents and ceremonial shields, suggesting that it was not regarded as a frivolous type of decoration.",

Patricia Fortini Brown prefers the terms cofanetto, cassettina or possibly scrigno. (Brown, P.F., Private Lives in Renaissance Venice: Art, Architecture and the family, New Haven and London, 2004). Luxurious fitted caskets of this type were fitted with a mirror inside the cover, indicating that they were used as vanity cases (though note that the interior of 7901-1861 has been restored.) The insides of these caskets were divided into several small compartments covered with silk, and 7901-1861 bears evidence of this. Decoration of an Islamic flavour was obviously fashionable. Huth suggests that this casket is representative of the type Gustav Ludwig calls the cassa da conzar (abbrev. conza da cao), in other words a box containing utensils to dress the hair, cao being the Venetian form of capo. Among other items a lady might keep in this box would be hair dye and bleach. Gustav Ludwig, p.303-4 is confident that this is Venetian, and suggests that while its usage is uncertain, it probably would not have been used for jewels (heavier scrigni were used for jewels); the mirror inside the lid suggests 'conze de cao' recorded inventories between 1501-90, or possibly the 'casselle di banca da letto' smaller boxes kept near the bed, which in inventories are recorded containing toilet accessories such as a scriminal (folding instrument in bone, glass or silver used for making a parting in the hair), combs, brushes (sedola),  handkerchiefs, sponzarol (sponge saucers used for cosmetics).",

XXV) suggests various ways in which luxury caskets were used, and his blazons for the toilet case of the chamber and the cabinet give a sense of their contents: \n(from the toilet case of the chamber) combs with large & small teeth which teeth, you must believe, are of ebony or white ivory or of boxwood, to dress beautiful hair, & also to shape long fair beards... scissors, the bodkin the well fashioned brush, the toothpick, the ear-cleaner, the marvellously small saw the file, the neat tweezers the scraper, & the little shears with many other articles enclosed and shut within you, case so pretty and so handsome, case bound with fine silver, case adorned with silk & gold...\n(from the cabinet) jewels, rings, precious stones, girdles with gold ornaments and with trimmings with gold chains, with beautiful buttons, with cuffs, with bracelets, with gorgets and with collars, sewn with pearls, with laundered and perfumed gloves,w ith musk more precious than gold ducats with fine ambergris and musk scented soap, with powder from Cyprus and pomade to restore faded colour, with Damascus, pink and rose water store in phials of glass, signet rings, paternosters, seals, tassels, knives, forks, scissors, the mirror...\n\nDecoration\nFine lacquerwork was made in Persia during the 16th century. It was commonly decorated with moresques executed in gold: this was done on relatively  small items, such as folding book-rests, book-covers, containers for writing materials, etc. Such objects excited the admiration of Europeans whenever they saw them, and early imitations of this work embodying moresque decoration were made in Venice. The technique was deemed suitable for embellishing the covers of highly important government documents, so apparently carried no light-hearted or frivolous connotation in the way that imitations of Chinese artefacts were often to do later. Venetian lacquer was also used for making small objects, such as jewel caskets covered with moresques, although entirely occidental figure-subjects occasionally  occupy panels within the imitation Islamic ornament. Sometimes the ground of the panels in such work was made of mother-of-pearl which reflects light back through the painted deocration applied on to it. A similar effect was contrived with a gold ground over which painted decoration was applied; the colours were often applied so as to form \u2018the ground\u2019, leaving the pattern itself unpainted (reserved as it is called).. exemplified on the V&A \u2018Queen Elizabeth virginals\u2019 (about 1570) or a harp ordered for the private orchestra of Duke Alfonso d\u2019Este (1581, Rome). Thornton pp.34-5\n\nHuth says that from the 13th century Venice had been an entry point to Europe for goods (earthenware, metalwork, textiles, jewelry and lacquerware) from the Levant and Orient. A Venetian document of 1283 consists of rules for the depentores (those working with a brush, involved in the production of varnished caskets, tables and woodwork). The decoration of wares as opposed to simply protecting them with varnishes seems to have begun during the mid 16th century. A Syrian craft which may have inspired Venetian artisans working in lacquer was the practice of damascening metal, known in Milan and Venice as early as 1300. The Italian craftsmen (no oriental craftsmen resided in Venice) who practised this art  were called azziministi. Another Oriental craft introduced to Venice from the late 15th century was the practise of fashioning elaborate bindings for books. Venetian copies or adaptations of lacquered bindings \u2018in the Persian style\u2019 date from the middle of the 16th century (eg Binding, Museo Correr 1570-77).  European engravings based on Moresque designs, such as those by \u2018the Master F\u2019, were circulating in Italian workshops as early as 1520. Venetian shields of wood covered with parchment, painted with knotwork and scrolls, and with areas in white, red and green that shone through the varnish, giving the effect of lacquer survive in armeria of the Doge\u2019s palace (Venice ) and from the household of the Bishop of Salzburg. Huth discusses other types of object (probably Venetian) with similar decoration, which may have been what was referred to by Italians variously as \u2018frissi grottesche\u2019, \u2018alla zemina\u2019 in the Persian manner, \u2018petteniera turchesca\u2019 in the Turkish manner: a quiver case, a folding table, small cases (casse da pettenti), caskets (scrigni or possibly what was known as \u2018casse da conzar il cao\u2019, boxes for dressing the hair), mirror frames and frames of architectural form with or without inset marble plaques, cuoridoro shields (described by Contadini in At Home in Renaissance Italy eds. Ajmar-Wollheim, and Dennis, pp.319-321), cabinets with leather coverings and musical instruments such as harpsichords and harps.\n\nMonika Kopplin, European Lacquer (Munich, 2010), pp.23-34\nKopplin notes that Venice traded in shellac, mainly from north-east India, Indochina and Sumatra, and maintains that Islamic lacquered objects (made from as early as the 10th/11th centuries) were undoubtedly present in Venice by the 16th century. Recent studies of the techniques used found that Venetian 'lacquer' was generally made up of linseed oil and colophony derived from pine resin, a composition also mentioned in contemporary writings such as Leonardo Fioravanti (1517-1588) in his 'Compendio  di secreti rationali' (Venice 1562). Turpentine of larch, also known as 'Venice turpentine' was also used, though not sandarac, the most important resin in Islamic lacquerwork but problematic on account of its limited availability and complex preparation. Arabesques were applied in powdered gold on the black-painted wood, and gold leaf employed for gilding larger decorative surfaces which were then given a luminous glow through a lustre finish in a variety of colours. Tempera was probably used as well as oils, and a final coat of glossy varnish applied. These studies suggest that the stylistic imitation of Islamic models was coupled with the use of largely identical techniques (p.24, citing Adriana Rizzo, 'Le \"laque\" v\u00e9nitien: Une approche scientifique', in Venise et l'Orient 828-1797, exh. cat., Institut du monde arabe, Paris (2006), pp. 244-51)",
