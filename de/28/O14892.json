By this he meant that they were based on observation, and retained elements of representation. He had absorbed the basic tenet of Cubism, advanced by Picasso and Braque, that painting is an act of creation, not imitation. \n\nThis gouache of 1936 is one of a series of paintings, based on rectangular forms, done between 1935 and 1938. The composition bears a superficial resemblance to Mondrian's grid paintings. Nicholson had visited Mondrian's studio in 1934: 'The paintings were entirely new to me and I did not understand them on this first visit (and indeed only partially understood them on my second visit a year later)'. \nThus Nicholson's debt to Mondrian was limited to visual and formal qualities. He adopted the primary colours combined with black and grey, but he worked with the rectangles in an intuitive way, quite unrelated to the intellectual systems of Mondrian. This picture and the related compositions are refinements of a remarkable still-life (<i>Painting  \u2013 Trout</i>) of 1924, in which the subject matter was reduced to simple overlapping planes, treading a fine balance between the motif and pure abstraction. \n\nThe ideal of the work of art as a construction, a personal interpretation or recreation of the visible world, dominated Nicholson's art in the 1930s. It is apparent in this architectonic composition with its blocks of colour, vibrant primaries against soft blacks and dull greys. Though it does not derive from a rigid application of a goemetric system, the composition is remarkable for a pictorial system of unparalleled rigour and simplicity. This is all the more surprising since it was developed independently in a period when British art was generally insular and figurative. Nicholson himself was largely responsible for forging the links with the European avant garde which revitalized the arts in England in the 1930s. \n\nIn 1936-7 Nicholson was involved in editing <i>Circle</i>, an 'International Survey of Constructive Art', with sculptor Naum Gabo and architect Leslie Martin. His own commitment to Constructivism was embodied in his classic works, the white-painted reliefs, which he also developed at this time. These simple hand-carved literally 'constructed' pieces were prefigured in their proportions and in the disposition of the planes by the 1930s geometric abstracts.\n\nGillian Saunders\"",
