Lord Harcourt (purchased in 1911).\n\nThis miniature is one of a group of ten originally displayed in two frames. Nine of the group were acquired by the V&A (E.1170-1178-1988), while the tenth of Mary Sidney, Countess of Pembroke by Nicholas Hilliard is now held by the National Portrait Gallery, London. The complex provenance of this group is described in an article by Sir Roy Strong, \"The Leicester House Miniatures\", Burlington Magazine CXXVII, October 1988. However, this miniature and E.1176-1988 were only added to the group early 20th century and are not referred to by Strong. George Perfect Harding visited many country houses making copies after earlier portraits. A known portrait of William Cecil, Lord Burghley (Erna Auberach, Hilliard, p.269, pl. 236) is similar.",

A known portrait of the same sitter (Auerbach, <u>Hilliard</u>, p. 269, pl. 236) shows the sitter in a similar position, with the same close fitting piped ruf and wearing a medal suspended from a chain around the neck.",
