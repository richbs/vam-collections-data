Fresh milk would be brought daily to the dairy and poured into these shallow pans to allow the cream to settle. This was then skimmed off and churned into butter. The management of the dairy was seen as a highly appropriate female pastime, associated with romantic notions of goodness and simplicity. From the late 17th century onwards, it became fashionable to embellish dairies with sumptuous decorations.\n\nPeople\nMary II (1662-1694) had temporary lodgings at Hampton Court in the old Water Gallery, a detached Tudor building fronting the Thames. From 1689 the building was remodelled in contemporary style after designs by Daniel Marot. It had a balcony on to the water and was decked with China and fine pictures. According to the writer Daniel Defoe, it had a 'dairy, with all its conveniences, in which the Queen took great delight'. Unfortunately Mary II did not live long to enjoy it; she died in 1694. All the surviving milk pans that are thought to have come from this dairy bear the mark of Adrianus Kocx, proprietor of the prestigious 'Greek A' factory in Delft, The Netherlands, from 1686 to 1701. At the time of her death, Mary II owed him \u00a3122 14s 9d for 'Dutch China or ware'.",
