This is a night scene coloured in shades of rich blue with the moon in the background indicating a seductive mood. This is a particularly important scene in which the song sung by Meena Kumari entices her husband not to leave her. Several lines from the song are reproduced on the lower part of the poster. The Hindi titles run across the top right hand corner with the actors listed in Hindi in the top left hand corner. \n\nThe lower half of the poster is in yellow and red and  has a close up portrait of a woman (Waheeda Rehman)  wearing a bindu and jewellery on her forehead,  this image is horizontal and facing downward. Next to her there is a verticle male portrait (Guru Dutt) and linking the two images is a 19th century wine bottle indicating  the historical  setting of the film  and  one of the themes of the narrative. The  English title is  written on the bottom right hand side of the poster. At the top of this section written in Hindi are the following lines from a song in the film: \" Please don't go lover, If you leave me I promise you I will die. Friends today sleep will not come to me\". This song is sung in the scene illustrated in the top half of the poster. The artist's signature is in the bottom right hand corner.",
