Large stylised tulips are combined with smaller tulips, carnations, hyacinths and other flowers superimposed on the petals.\n\nThis type of luxurious silk textile was used for furnishings and for clothing. The main centre of production was Bursa in north-west Anatolia in Turkey. The industry was established there in the 15th century, largely to compete with Italian imports.\n \nThe two most popular designs were the curved lattice, and rows of stylised flowers or stars. Originally introduced to Turkey from Italy, they gradually evolved into the dramatic, large-scale patterns associated with the Ottoman court. \n\nThe type of arrangement of flowers in staggered rows seen here was common in textiles. From about 1550 floral motifs were popular in all forms of Ottoman art.",
