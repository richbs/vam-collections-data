            "public_access_description": "This bottle is an example of the fine gilded and enamelled glass manufactured under the Mamluk dynasty, which ruled Egypt and Syria between 1250 and 1517. The design, dominated by a large-scale inscription in blue enamel, is typical of work produced around 1300 to 1350. The mouldings below the mouth of the bottle and around the top of the high foot indicate that the form of this vessel is based on a precious-metal prototype, for which the mouldings would have been structurally necessary. \n\nThe decoration on the body is in two registers. The main feature of the upper register is three roundels containing a phoenix motif of Chinese origin, reserved in a blue ground. This bird, together with a Chinese-style dragon, had become a popular symbol of royal power among the Mamluks.\n\nThree roundels in the lower register contain an arabesque motif reserved in a red ground. These roundels divide the inscription into three parts. It reads, \u2018Glory to our master the Sultan, the Wise, the Just King\u2019. Texts such as this appear on many Mamluk objects and indicate that such items were originally made for use at court. The fashion for them probably spread to the richer members of Mamluk society outside the court and they were also exported to Europe.\n\nThe flattened underside of the bottle and the high foot were left plain, since they could not be seen by those using the bottle, who would have sat on the ground in the Arab manner, looking down on the bottle.",

Syria is generally credited with the production of most secular enamelled glass, though finds from Fustat, Egypt, have yielded sherds of with a surprising variety of enamel decoration. This bottle appears to fit in with the middle to later style of enamelled glass decoration, with an elaborate and extensive design programme which covers the entire bottle. Figural decoration which is typical of the early Mamluk period, between 1250 and 1300, has been reduced here to a series of phoenixes in heraldic poses and the inscription to an unamed sultan has taken over as the primary form of decoration.",
