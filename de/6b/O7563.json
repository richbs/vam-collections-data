The high-waisted bodice is quilted at the back, with a centre seam and a rounded neck, and has plain crossover panels and a V neck at the front; the neck, inside edge and hem are bound with ivory ribbon, and the skirt is lightly gathered to the bodice.  The short magyar sleeves, the outside edge of the garment, and the skirt flap are scalloped and worked with blanket stitch in cream embroidery silk, and the flap is also embroidered with looped sprays of daisies using French knots, stem stitch and satin stitch.  The garment wraps together right over left with a slit under the true right arm, fastening with pairs of ribbons beneath the arms and at the true left waist; the skirt flap folds up over the skirt and ties with three doubled ribbons, threaded through horizontal tabs of ribbon stitched to the skirt.",
