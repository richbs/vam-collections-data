It shows a full length image of a woman dressed in a loose pale blue shirt with pleated white trimming at the collar and also at the cuffs of the elbow length sleeves. The 'V' shaped neckline has a central black bow beneath which is a small button (further buttons are used for decorative effect on the sleeves). Her black pleated skirt finishes just below her knees in a double flounce trimmed with a series of black bows. A band of white fabric is wound around and across her waist and fastened in a loose bow at the back. She also wears a small black hat set far on the back of her head and trimmed with a black bow. Her shoes are fastened with crossed ribbons which tie in a bow across the front of her ankle.\n\nThree scraps of fabric, one navy silk satin, another pale blue silk and the third sky blue silk are stapled to the top right hand corner of the design.",
