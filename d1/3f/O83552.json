The dress has magyar sleeves (in which the armhole and upper arm are cut very wide, narrowing to the elbow and wrist), a tightly fitted bodice and a dropped waist.  The circular skirt is embellished with a fashionable bustle bow.  The cotton fabric was made in Manchester for export to the West African market.  The British government actively promoted the cotton industry during the War, forming the influential Cotton Board in 1940.  The Incorporated Society of London Fashion Designers, whose designers included Amies, worked closely with the Board to create stylish fashions in British cottons. This dress, with its extravagantly full skirt, shows the influence of the \u2018New Look\u2019, the luxurious, post-War style created French couturier Christian Dior which used yards of fabric to achieve a curvaceous, full-skirted silhouette.",
