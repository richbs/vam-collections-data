The sketch on p. 34 may have been used as a study for 'There were three ravens sat in a tree', exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1876 (no. 415).  The sketch on p. 35 is a study for an illustration to 'A Frog he would a-wooing go', published in 1883, and the highly finished sketches on pp. 41, 45 and 47 may have suggested the idea for 'Our Haymaking', which was published in the summer edition of 'The Graphic' in 1881.  Inside the back cover are pencil notes referring to a garden scene.\nThe volume consists of 106 pages in total, many of which are unused.  The paper is cream coloured wove paper, some tinted, bound in canvas boards, with a printed label reading the name of the sketchbook's manufacturer in London.  The drawings on pp. 34-38 are pasted in.",
