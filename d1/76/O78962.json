It has an upholstered seat and back which are covered with embroidery in coloured wool on canvas ground, with a walnut frame. Its back and seat depict two different scenes.\n\nMaterials & Making\nNeedlework in wool on canvas was considered to be the most durable form of upholstered seat covering, and was sometimes made by the ladies of the house. Contemporary book illustrations were used as sources for the needlework patterns.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe back shows a pastoral scene: two figures in quasi-oriental costume and a flute player under a tree. The seat shows a scene from Aesop's Fables: a  fox addressing a crow (from 'The Fox and the Crow').",
