            "public_access_description": "Carved hall seats like this one were very often found in the halls of grand Dutch houses in the period 1700 to 1750. Throughout Europe, halls were seen as a transitional space between the exterior and interior of a house. Their furnishings were therefore often rather austere, with wooden seats and little other furniture. Seats such as these were usually painted or varnished, either to match the decoration of the walls or to imitate some luxurious material, such as marble or mahogany. On this one the end panels and seat are made in oak, a strong wood that gave it structural stability. The back panel is carved in maple (sycamore). This is a fine-grained wood that allowed the carver to work in delicate detail.\n\nWhen the V&A purchased the seat, microscopic analysis of samples of paint showed that it had been painted five times. The earliest layer was a white, marbled finish. This has now been reinstated.",
