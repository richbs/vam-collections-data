However, it does have features which lift it out of the ordinary.  Dresser's commitment to practicality led him to include a dip in the soup plates to help in scooping up the last spoonful.  The plates of this service had indents in the rims for condiments.  The vegetable dish is of a strongly geometric form,  typical of Dresser's design style.\n\nPeople\nDresser was a trained botanist and perhaps the most radical and prolific of 19th-century designers.  He was often described as a 'pioneer of modern design' and promoted quality, machine production and new materials. His interest in and  commitment to commercial design meant that he actively sought opportunities to design for inexpensive mass production.\n\nDesign & Designing\nDresser's designs for the Old Hall Earthenware Company were first registered in 1884.  This service was registered in 1886. Although it was given the name 'Shanghai', the pattern has no connection at all with Chinese ornament or the east Asia. This complete irrelevance of name to pattern is common in Victorian ceramics. This same shape was also decorated with other patterns called 'Persian' and 'Hampden'.",
