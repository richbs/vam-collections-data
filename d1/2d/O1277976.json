Pidcock kept his animals there but toured them to London fairs and the provinces during the summer. \n\nPidcock's menagerie at Exeter Change was an exhibition hall in London's Strand. The menagerie was divided into three rooms and included African lions, tigers, beavers, emus and ostriches. According to The Morning Chronicle in 1808, the animals could be viewed for a shilling a room, or all three rooms for two shillings and sixpence. \n\nGilbert Pidcock died in 1810 aged 67, and was succeeded by Polito and then Cross. All the animals were removed to the Surrey Zoological Gardens in about 1828, after which Exeter Change was demolished..",
