            "public_access_description": "This is a computerised design drawing for a ceramic teapot by Queensberry Hunt, one of four drawings which form a linear sequence. The first two drawings (E.139-140-2005) dated June 2003, are based directly on the designers' plaster model. When these drawings reveal that the teapot will not hold the 1.2 litres specified by the manufacturer, adjustments need to be made. A third drawing (E.141-2005), dated August 2003, accurately redraws the teapot to its new dimensions (after firing). The fourth and final drawing in the sequence sets out the dimensions of the teapot prior to firing (E.142-2005), allowing for the shrinkage which the clay will experience in the kiln. A separate fifth drawing (E.143-2005) is a 'scatter sheet' showing the entire Soho range.\n\nDavid Queensberry and Martin Hunt are leading UK designers of ceramics and glass. In 2003 they were asked to create a new range for Portmeirion Potteries Ltd., creating simple designs for a company more often associated with very decorative wares.Queensberry Hunt is unusual in that the designers still use plaster models to realise the form of their ceramics, rather than relying on CAD modelling as most designers now do. They turn to computer drawings only when they have made an exact model. \n\nThe V&A's Department of Sculpture, Metalwork, Ceramics and Glass holds the resin-coated plaster design model, plaster production mould and finished pieces from the same 'Soho' range.",
