            "public_access_description": "Saggars are fire-clay containers used for stacking and protecting pottery during firing. Saggars are usually cylindrical and have three evenly spaced rows of triangular holes in their sides. Each hole could be fitted with a peg, triangular in section, and usually three pegs supported a piece of pottery to be fired. Once filled the saggars could be stacked, one on top of another, in the furnace for the glaze firing. Apart from its ease of stacking, the benefit of firing in a saggar was that they protected the pieces inside from kiln debris. Therefore, the pots could be placed in the saggars on their base rather that up-side-down. When the glaze stuck to the pegs, it would have left only small scars on the back-side of the pot and not on the front as with firing on spurs.\nThis saggar would have had a large inside diameter and was almost certainly used to fire plates or dishes.\nFragments of such saggars have been found in their hundreds in Delft during construction works carried out during the first decade of the 21st century.",
