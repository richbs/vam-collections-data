The lady is unknown, yet she must have been a wealthy woman, judging by her heavy and elaborate jewellery, complete with necklace, chain, earrings, jewels on the front and shoulders of her dress, and a kind of aigrette in her hair. The edges of her starched ruff are also elaborately decorated with red textile ties. In an age when clothes were assumed to be an accurate indicator of status, it was judged essential to wear your wealth, especially when being immortalised in a portrait.",

Other damage includes slight flaking of the right eye, the loss of the red glaze from the rubies and the oxidization of the silver.  The hair is still painted in the free linear style of the 1580s and the miniature must therefore just pre-date the change in manner established in the Unknown Lady of 1593 (no. 95).  An almost identical dress appears in a portrait by Gheeraerts dated 1592 (Strong, <i>The English Icon</i>, p. 291 (288).  Auerbach\u2019s dating c. 1595 therefore cannot be sustained.\n\nAn eighteenth or nineteenth century metal frame is inscribed on the back with an identification as Queen Elizabeth which can be discounted.\n\nCOLLECTIONS: Mrs Wyndham Cook as Queen Elizabeth; bequeathed by E. Peter Jones 1948.\n\nLITERATURE: Auerbach, <i>Hilliard</i>, p. 133, pl. 100; 305 (100).\u201d\n<u>Victoria and Albert Museum, Department of Engraving, Illustration and Design & Department of Paintings, Accessions 1947</u>, London: HMSO, 1950.\nThe full text of the record is as follows:\n\n'<b>NICHOLAS HILLIARD (1547-1619)</b>\n\nMiniature portrait of a lady, c.1595.\n<i>On vellum on card.
