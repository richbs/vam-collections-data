The city of Dresden was home to a treasury which was later extended by Augustus the Strong, Elector of Saxony and King of Poland (ruled 1694-1733). This famous Green Vault (as it was known) encouraged the production of luxury objects. Under Augustus's successors, the goldsmiths Heinrich Taddel and his son-in-law Johann Christian Neuber became its directors.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
