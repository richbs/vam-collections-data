Ding wares were of the earliest true porcelains made in China, and the world. The term porcelain is applied to ceramics made from a mixture containing a clay called kaolin and a white stone called petuntse, which was fired at high temperatures. Porcelains differ from other ceramics in their impermeability, whiteness after firing and fine texture.\n\nIn 1126 the Hebei province experienced great change as the Northern Song dynasty ended and the Jin dynasty established power. Despite such upheaval, Ding wares continued to be produced after a short interval as an \u2018official ware\u2019, meaning it was selected to supply ceramics to the court and the most elite officials in China. \n\nFrom the beginning of the Jin dynasty, the characteristics of Ding ware changed slightly. Instead of the hand-incised decorations which previously adorned its surfaces, its designs began to mimic that of the metal ware of the period through the use of moulded design. This was achieved by shaping the clay over domed moulds, which gave the form of the object and impressed the inside pattern in one step. The fish pattern on this dish was probably derived from a similar pattern on a gold or silver dish. The use of moulds allowed for much more elaborate patterns and shapes in Ding ware of the Jin period.",
