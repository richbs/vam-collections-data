Raymond Sheppard would make rapid sketches of his two children, Christine and Michael, while they played and would then make these up into finished paintings.\n\nThe toys in the room belonged to the children. The doll in white clothes was called Sylvie, the clown figure moved his arms and the skipping rope was used by Christine and her friends. The painting book is probably a 'magic' painting book, of which the children had many much loved examples. The book that is in front of Christine may be \"The Golden Gift Book\" a collection of stories for children published in 1939 in which Sheppard has some illustrations.",
