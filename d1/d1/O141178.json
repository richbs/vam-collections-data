The vine scroll decoration is produced by using moulds that are re-used across the surviving group.  Over the group there are six discernible variants in decoration (oral communication from Hiltrud Westermann-Anghausen of the Schn\u00fctgen Museum, Cologne).\n\nThe vine scroll is a standard Romanesque stylistic feature, appearing in other artforms as well as metalwork (eg the tympanum of the west doorway of the Baptistery at Parma Cathedral, commissioned in 1196).",
