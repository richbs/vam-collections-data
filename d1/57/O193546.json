Such ornamental abundance is unique in Estonia.\n\nThe Setu people are a small ethnic minority living in South-East Estonia. For centuries, they have lived between two worlds with Orthodox Russia in the east and formerly Catholic, but now Lutheran, Estonia in the west. The language, customs and folk costumes of the Setu people have influences from both sides.  Above all, however, they have kept their own regional distinctiveness. The Setu language is one of many South-Estonian dialects and is not usually understood by people from North-Estonia. The Setu folk costumes bear both Russian and \u2018Fenno-Ugric\u2019 elements (the term \u2018Fnno-Ugric\u2019 describes the Estonian, Finnish and Hungarian languages and the cultures in which they have been spoken). Setu culture was in decline in the 1980s and symbolised a potentially dark future for Estonians and Estonian culture under Soviet rule. \n\nIn September 2009 the Setu style of singing, leelo, was included to the UNESCO World Heritage List.",
