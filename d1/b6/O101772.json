The original colours can be seen in a narrow strip down at the right-hand edge which was turned under. The top three-quarters of the ground are embroidered in a blue wool which, from the evidence of the right-hand edge, was originally a deep indigo virtually indistinguishable from the black ground of the lower part of the hanging. The blue ground is not worked over an older ground and it seems likely that the hanging was originally left unfinished and that the blue ground dates from the late 18th century. There are however some later 19th century repairs. The hanging was mounted as a three fold screen in the early twentieth century.\n\nThe centre is filled with two nearly identical pairs of entwined trees bearing large leaves and a variety of flowers: tulips, carnations, lotus, peony, honeysuckle, anemones, etc. At the base of the trees are flowery mounds with animals: a dog chasing a hare and a standing leopard. There is a narrow border decorated with stylised leaves and flower heads.",
