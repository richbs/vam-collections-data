The illustration is of a large scale as it was made to be shown on television. In this illustration Jennings and Darbyshire are shown on the right looking up at the Physics teacher Mr Wilkins, who is standing by a blackboard on a platform. The innocent gaze of the boys contrasts with that of their teacher, who is apparently trying to explain something to them. Wilkins looks distressed and about to lose his temper, presumably as a result of one of Jennings and Darbyshire\u2019s pranks. \n\n\u201cThanks to Jennings\u201d comes from a series of 25 Jennings books which Anthony Buckeridge (1912-2004) wrote between 1950 and 1994. These humorous children\u2019s books were set in a boy\u2019s boarding school during the years after World War Two. The humour of the books draws on the combination of this setting with the misunderstandings resulting in the actions of by the impulsive Jennings his more cautious best friend, Darbyshire. While illustrating a moment from \u201cThanks to Jennings\u201d this work effectively creates a sense of the different personalities of the characters, such as the angry temper of Wilkins which contrasts with the mild mannered Darbyshire and impulsive Jennings.",
