Made in costly fabric, this dress was worn by Miss Heather Firbank, sister of the novelist Ronald Firbank. The structure of the bodice is especially interesting and modern in its appeal. The sleeves (with long tapered cuffs) are cut in one with the unseamed bodice back and are turned over the shoulders and top-stitched in raglan type seams at the front. The bodice is gathered into a high waist from which falls the slender columnar skirt. The flat plane at the back is created by a pair of deeply inverted pleats. The dress wraps over and fastens along the left front with press studs under a line of false buttonholes and pendant buttons.

It has an unusual bodice (without centre back seam), incorporating bat-wing sleeves with long, tapered cuffs and a wired 'Tudor'-style, heart-shaped collar. The gown wraps over and fastens along the left front with tiny press-studs under a line of blind buttonholes with pendant buttons. \n\nThis is from the collection of Heather Firbank (1888-1954), daughter of the MP Sir Thomas Firbank and sister of the novelist Ronald Firbank. The dress is a half-mourning dress, meaning that it was worn in the later stages of mourning. Mourning etiquette was well controlled and what could be worn at each stage was rigidly prescribed.",
