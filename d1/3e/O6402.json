Henry Greener designed his first example a few months earlier in commemoration of the landslide victory of the Liberal Party under Gladstone at the elections of 1868. The idea of making such commemorative pieces in pressed glass, which came from America, proved to be extremely popular and profitable.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe technique of press-moulding glass with the aid of a hand-operated machine was first perfected in the United States of America in the early 1820s. It took only two people to shape a measured quantity of hot glass in a heated metal mould. By simply depressing a lever, a metal plunger was lowered into the glass, forcing it into the patterned mould. By the 1830s this method had spread to Europe and Britain, giving rise to stylistic changes and revolutionising the availability of glassware. The technique made the mid- to late 19th century the first period of true mass production. In the 1890s the introduction of steam-powered presses improved quality while cutting costs even further.\n\nPeople\nGreener & Co., in Sunderland, was a relatively small firm which often produced innovative patterns and designs.",
