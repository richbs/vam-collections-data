This tile is decorated with a famous scene from the epic Iranian poem known as the Khamsah, or Five Tales of Nizami, written by the 12th century Iranian poet Nizami Ganjavi. The romance of Khusraw and Shirin; is the second of these tales, and relates the passionate courtship of the Sasanian monarch Khusraw and the Armenian Princess Shirin. The image represents the moment when Khusraw comes towards a stream and sees a beautiful girl bathing; her beauty is compared with the moon, roses and almonds. \n\nThe tales were recorded in manuscripts, many beautifully illustrated, for Iranian rulers. This scene was probably copied from a contemporary lithograph. The lithographic printing process was introduce to Iran in the 1840s, and  almost immediately inexpensive copies of the great classics were produced and widely circulated. They are dressed in typical Qajar fashion of the early 19th century, of tight waisted knee length coats.In the mid-19th century, tiles were sold as individual objects for display, rather than as multi-part friezes, and many were acquired by Western tourists and visitors as souvenirs.",
