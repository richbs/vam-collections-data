Some examples used camels, monkeys or people as figures of fun, completely abandoning any relevance and entering the realms of novelty and sometimes of impracticability. This teapot borders on the whimsical and would certainly have provided a topic for conversation at teatime.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe complex shape added considerably to the difficulties of making and of applying the pattern.  It was slip-cast in a convoluted mould,  but the material is earthenware (the cheapest to fire) and the decoration is transfer-printed.\n\nDesign\nThe source of this highly elaborate teapot design is India.  Burgess & Leigh registered the design in 1896 as a teapot,  but its shape copies precisely the form and surface decoration of a multi-colour printed biscuit tin registered by Huntley & Palmer. The ensuing law suit resulted in Burgess & Leigh adapting their similarly coloured teapot to this monochrome version.  An example of both Huntley & Palmer's tin and of Burgess & Leigh's original, coloured teapot copy are also in the Museum's collections. This highly elaborate teapot shows an Indian scene, with an elephant, British and Indian people and hunting dogs.  Traditionally Chinese shapes and decoration were the most common for teawares, but here, in the Victorian days of Empire, India was favoured.",
