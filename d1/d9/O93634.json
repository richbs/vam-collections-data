The use of the phrase \u2018a little stranger\u2019 to mean a new baby was already in humorous use in the English language by the early years of the 19th century. As the century progressed, it became particularly popular as part of the phrase \u2018expecting a little stranger\u2019 - a euphemism for pregnancy, replacing even more obscure phrases such as \u2018spraining an ankle\u2019.",
