One portion is decorated with freely drawn double lines, rising from the foot to the rim, descending in a series of loops. The second section bears parallel lines of slip drawn diagonally across the wall of the jar. A band approximately 6 cm wide at the foot is glazed but with no slip.\nThe artist is a graduate of Hongik University and his work is inspired by the ceramics of Korea's past, refering specifically to punch'\u00f4ng and onggi wares.",
