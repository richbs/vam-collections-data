The inlaid ivory decoration, incorporated using the decorative technique known as intarsia, was designed by Stephen Webb (1849-1933).  Webb was Collinson & Lock\u2019s chief designer at this period and an experienced designer of intarsia.  He was later appointed Professor of Sculpture at the Royal College of Art.\n\nThe inlaid ivory is typical of the elaborate inlay of woods, stones, metal and ivory associated with the Renaissance and a popular technical and stylistic revival in late nineteenth-century design. \n\nThe table was acquired by G.J.S. Lock of Collinson & Lock and then passed to his son. It was his son\u2019s wish that it be given to the Victoria and Albert Museum.  This wish was carried out by his friend Miss. E.A. Comer who offered it to the Museum when she inherited it after his death.",
