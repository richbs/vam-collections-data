            "history_note": "This engraving featured in Thomas Bewick's first major independent publication, <i>A General History of Quadrupeds</i>, first printed and published in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1790. The publication contains illustrations of animals, alongside brief descriptions of their appearance, habits and habitats, accompanied by a number of illustrative vignettes, used mainly as tailpieces. \n\nThe text accompanying the illustration (in the publication) reads as follows: \n\n'<i>THE LEMING, OR LAPLAND MARMOT. \nThis wonderful little animal is found only in the northern parts of Europe and Asia; and is sometimes seen in immense numbers, overspreading large tracts of country, in Norway, Sweden and Lapland. But as its appearance is at very uncertain periods, and the source from whence it is derived has not been hitherto explored by any naturalist, its existence has been seriously attributed, superstitious ignorance, to the generation of the clouds, from whence, it has been supposed, it was poured down in showers of rain. \u2013 Myriads of them march together; and, like a torrent which nothing can resist, their course is marked with ruin and desolation. Neither fire not water prevents their progress. They go straight forward, in regular lines, about three feet asunder, and generally in a south-east direction: They swim across lakes and rivers: No opposition impedes them. If thousands are destroyed, thousands supply their place: The void is quickly filled up; and their number does not appear diminished. They persist in their course, in spite of every obstacle; and if prevented from proceeding, they either by assiduity surmount it, or die in the attempt. \u2013 Their march is mostly in the night. They rest during the day, and devour every root and vegetable they meet with. They infect the very herbage; and cattle are said to perish that feed upon the grass they have touched. \n\nAn enemy, so numerous and destructive, would soon render the countries they pass through utterly uninhabitable, did it not fortunately happen, that the same rapacity that excites them to lay waste the productions of the earth, at last impels them to destroy each other. \u2013 Having nothing more to subsist on, they are said to separate into two armies, which engage with the most deadly hatred, and continue fighting and devouring each other till they are all entirely destroyed. Thousands of them have been found dead; and the air, infected by their putrid carcases, has sometimes been the occasion of malignant distempers. \u2013 Great numbers of them are likewise destroyed by Foxes, Lynxes, Weasels, and other beasts of prey, which follow them during their march. \n\nThe Leming runs swiftly, although its legs are short and slender. \u2013 It is somewhat less than the Rat: Its head is pointed; and in each jaw are two very long cutting-teeth, with which it bites keenly: Its ears are short, eyes small, fore legs shorter than the hind: The colour of the head and body black and tawny, disposed in irregular patches; the belly white, tinged with yellow. \n\nThough perfectly disgusting to every other people, its flesh is said to be eaten by the Laplanders. \n\nWhere these emigrants are collected, as was before observed, is not certainly known. Linn\u00e6us says, they are produced among the Norwegian and Lapland Alps; and Pontoppidan supposes, that Kolen\u2019s Rock, which divides Nordland from Sweden, is their native place. But wherever they come from, none return. Their course is predestined; and they pursue their fate.</i>' \n\nTaken from: Beilby, Ralph and Bewick, Thomas. <u>A General History of Quadrupeds</u>. Newcastle upon Tyne. Third Edition, 1792.\n\nHistorical significance: Thomas Bewick was the first engraver to exploit fully the advantages of end-grain wood (the wood is cut across, rather than along, the grain). Once it had been proved that the technique could rival the fine effects of metal engraving, the advantages of wood engraving to the book trade were quickly recognised. Allowing both text and illustration to be printed in one operation, it ousted the intaglio process as the favourite for book illustration and was only superseded at the end of the nineteenth century when methods of photomechanical reproduction were developed.",
