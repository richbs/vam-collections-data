She also studied at York College and Rhode Island School of Design.  The artist specialises in illustration of children\u2019s books and draws her inspiration from such 20th century illustrators such as Edward Bawden (1903-  1989) and Eric Ravilious (1903- 1942) and American lithographed children's books. She typically includes in her work objects found in museums and antique shops. \n\nThis illustration is characteristic of Emily  Sutton\u2019s style and technique, using detail, pattern and colour.  The illustration of a boy swinging from a rope with a sword with a tiger in pursuit in a forested interior is reminiscent of 'Le Douanier' Rousseau.  The interior setting is the Cast Room in the Victoria and Albert Museum.",
