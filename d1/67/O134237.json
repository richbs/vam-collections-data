Born in the UK to Jamaican parents, Archer-Straw returned to Jamaica as a young adult and later studied at Jamaica's School of Art. She regularly exhibited in Jamaica during the 1980s, including in solo exhibitions based on single themes relating to her life. \u2018Page Six\u2019 originates from this period. Its form resembles that of a woven carpet, with bands of decorative pattern and a central area filled with hieroglyphic forms. Archer-Straw has noted that her artwork during this period was influenced by feminist readings and, while the work is not consciously feminist, \u2018the central theme is about female patterns and life cycles\u2019.",
