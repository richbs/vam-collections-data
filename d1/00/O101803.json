London: The Victoria and Albert Museum in association with Hurtwood Press, 1983.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n\"<i>Andrew Pitcairn-Knowles   British   1871-1956\nThe Brussels Dog Market   About 1900\nToned Gelatin silver chloride or 'Gaslight' paper print\n119 X 164 mm  Mus. no. Ph 314-1982\nGiven by Mr and Mrs Richard Pitcairn-Knowles</i>\n\nContact printing gelatin papers usually employed silver chloride.  Often called 'Gaslight' papers, they could be handled in subdued artificial light, and required only a short exposure to a gaslamp or electric light, followed by development to give a cold-toned black and white image.  Most contact printing papers had glossy or at least smooth surfaces to ensure proper contact between the negative and the paper in the printing frame.  Textured papers were used for enlarging, where the negative was projected onto the paper; since greater sensitivity was needed, enlarging papers were, and still are, made using silver bromide.  These examples were contact printed on glossy gelatin silver chloride paper, toned to change the image colour from the rather cold neutral tones characteristic of the paper.\nAndrew Pitcairn-Knowles was born in Rotterdam, educated in England and Germany, and lived with his wife and son in Berlin, Brussels and Paris.  He wrote articles for <i>Wide World Magazine, Outing, Badminton Magazine, Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News</i>, and himself launched <i>Sport im Bild</i> in Berlin in 1895.  He took photographs to illustrate his articles, which covered such topics as sand yachting in Belgium, the animal markets in Paris and Brussels, badger baiting in Germany, cider-making, motor racing and the Derby.  \nPitcairn-Knowles occupies a position at the beginning of the era of photo-journalism, providing picture stories for specialist magazines and the popular 'human interest' illustrated press of the early half-tone period.  His activities in photography came to an end with the outbreak of the First World War, when he established a 'Hydro' at Hastings. ",
