Full citation: \n\n\"<b>Unknown Man </b>\n<b>1657-60</b>\nP116-1910 \n\n<b>Oval 70 x 57 mm</b> \n\nFeatures in broad powerful strokes of brown and sanguine, blended with fine blue and grey hatches into a warm carnation ground; white in the eyes with black spots for the pupils; hair in pale brown wash, the strands lined in long strokes of dark brown with the lights in pale brown and ochre gouache; collar in pale grey wash with the lights in thick white; coat in black wash, modelled and with the lights in paler greys; background a solid dark brown wash; on vellum put down on a leaf from a table-book. \n\n<b>Condition:</b> Marginal losses especially in the upper edge; otherwise sound and little faded. \n\n<b>Signed:</b> Not signed. \n\n<b>Frame:</b> Nineteenth- or early twentieth-century oval silver-gilt locket; the back slightly convex and the sides with a broad and deep Single channel, holding the nearly flat glass in a bezel; the hanger of D-shaped wire in tear-drop form, soldered directly to the top of the locket, with twin spirals of flat wire, each beginning in a small reverse turn, soldered to the back of the locket and rising from the front into five diminishing turns. \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> Apparently 1862-8 (at least) PH Howard; subsequently George Salting, by whom bequeathed to the Museum, 1910. \n\n<b>Exhibited:</b> Probably South Kensington 1862, no. 2480; South Kensington 1865, no. 1402; Leeds 1868, no. 3079 (all as <i>6th Duke of Norfolk</i> by F1atman). \n\n<b>Literature:</b> Long 1930, p. 92 ('17th century copy of part of a picture by Sir Peter Lely'): Douglas Cooper, <i>The Courtauld Collection</i> (University of London Athlone Press, 1954), pp. 182-3, no. 238; <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 70. \n\nThe miniature came to the Museum still bearing its nineteenth-century attribution to Flatman, but Salting had himself commented in a note quoted by Long (from the lost Salting notebooks): 'Too good for Flatman'. As a Flatman of Henry Howard, 6th Duke of Norfolk, it is traceable back through the Leeds and South Kensington exhibitions of the 1860s to Henry Howard, a provenance which presumably explained the traditional identification. \n\nAs to the artist, Long wrote firmly on the file 'Not by Flatman' and wondered momentarily '?by Chas. Beale', but crossed that out without exploring the idea further on the record. In March 1958 Reynolds annotated letters between himself and John Kerslake of the NPG about the sitter -'?? by Gibson'. Both these ideas were sensible: the miniature is a copy after Lely (see below) and both Gibson and Beale were associates and copyists of Lely. \n\nBut since 1958 ideas about Gibson have been refined and the typical marks of his hand (particularly the diagonal striation and the contoured impasto around the features) are not as strongly present here as the general appearance of the miniature would lead one to expect. The date of the Lely original would be c.1658-60, and this copy would therefore have to sustain comparison with the 'Carnarvon group' of c. 1657, (1) to which may be added <i>inter alia</i> the unfaded <i>Unknown Lady</i> in the collection of Miss Betty Hodgkinson, in all of which the hand is much more painterly, less graphic, less free in execution than that of the present miniature. \n\nAlthough he himself rejected it, Long's idea of Beale is worth entertaining. Side by side, this miniature and the Beale copy of Lely's self-portrait (Beale, Cat. No. 148) look good. Both are copies after Lely of the same period, and both they and the Welbeck Abbey version are Similarly brilliant and muscular in handling, with the same balance of long strokes, hatching and polychrome blending in the features. On the other hand, place the present miniature beside the <i>Lauderdale</i> pair (Beale, Cat. Nos 150 and 151) and any idea of Beale as a stable stylistic entity to which attribution is possible must disappear. \n\nUntil 1928 this miniature was assumed to be <i>ad vivum</i>, but at Christie's 15 June 1928, lot 58, Long saw the Lely original (from the collection of Sir John Foley Grey, Bart; now Adelaide). It was called <i>Sir George Howard</i>. At the same time (13 June) a correspondent, W H Hammond of Sevenoaks, suggested to him that the sitter was actually George Booth, Lord Delamere (d.1684), so Long remained sceptical. But Hammond's identification prevailed in the market-place, and the painting reappeared at Christie's 28 May 1937, lot 98, catalogued as Lord Delamere, but minus its Lely attribution, because in the meantime Collins Baker and W G Constable (2) had attributed it to Soest. \n\nPeter Murray was the next to work on the problem when he was cataloguing the supposed pendant of the <i>Howard/Delamere</i>, a portrait of a lady, purchased by Samuel Courtauld and believed by him and his friend Arthur Lee to be Ursula 'Mrs Lely'. (3) Confirming the Lely attribution of both portraits, he pointed out that there was no Sir George Howard c.1660 (a dating of the portrait which he owed to Oliver Millar) and that Lord Delamere, as represented in the Ashmolean drawing by Gardiner, looked quite different. So the miniature reverted tentatively to <i>Henry, 6th Duke of Norfolk</i> until Piper pointed out in his entry for another portrait thought to be of the 6th Duke in the NPG (4) that Norfolk had 'a curious hairy growth from a deep dimple or scar at the left side of his chin'. This feature is of course not present in the miniature. Piper also recorded that this NPG picture was previously thought to have been by Mary Beale; presumably a coincidence. \n\n1 Murdoch and Murrell 1981. pp. 282-9; see also Gibson, Cat.
