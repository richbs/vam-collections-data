            "public_access_description": "The church of San Pietro di Castello was the Cathedral of Venice until 1807, when the title passed to St. Mark\u2019s.The drawing shows the double-fa\u00e7ade structure with a large front door flanked by two Corinthian columns and surmounted by a pediment. Four larger Corinthian columns support a top pediment decorated with the papal coat of arms. There are two empty niches on both sides of the front door. Two lateral wings surmounted by a broken pediment completed the fa\u00e7ade. They both have a smaller door surmounted by a pediment. At the bottom, a cross-section of the fa\u00e7ade shows its decoration relief. The church has been founded during the VIIth century on the Olivolo Island in Venice and dedicated to the Byzantine saints Sergio and Bacco. The church is one of the most antique churches in Venice albeit it was demolished by a fire in 1120. After several reconstructions, a complete facelift was carried out based on a model by Andrea Palladio (1508-1580), beginning only with the creation of the facade in 1596. The campanile however was built in 1490 after a design by the architect Mauro Condussi. During the First World War the church was hit by two incendiary bombs which damaged the dome.\n\nAntonio Visentini (Venice, 21 Nov 1688 \u2013 Venice, 26 June 1782) was an Italian painter, engraver, architect and theorist. He was first known as a painter and trained with the Venetian history painter Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini (1675-1741). He became known as an engraver by the end of the 1720s when he was commissioned by Joseph Smith to produce engravings of Canaletto\u2019s views of Venice. Visentini started working as an architect in 1731, and his first theoretical work, Libro di Architettura, which included Rococo-influenced drawings by Pier Antonio Morelli after Visentini\u2019s ideas, was published in 1733. \n\nHis ideas on contemporary architecture derived from Antiquity and the work of Andrea Palladio (1508-80). Later however, Visentini developed neo-Palladian and anti-Baroque ideas. Visentini and his pupils executed numerous drawings of ancient and contemporary buildings intended to disseminate exemplary architecture. He participated to the foundation of the Venetian Academy in 1755, where he became a teacher of architectural perspective in 1772.",
