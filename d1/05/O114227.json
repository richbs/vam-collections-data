They were popular motifs in the Renaissance, repeated on Italian bridal chests and on French and Flemish tapestries in the 15th and 16th centuries. Engraved ornament of this kind would have been used to design decorative borders and friezes, and some was probably specifically intended for arms and armour. \n\nThis engraving shows eight satyrs and centaurs in battle, attempting to abduct women. In Greek mythology, a satyr was a wood-dwelling creature with the head and body of a man, and the ears, horns and legs of a goat; centaurs were half-human, half-horse.",
