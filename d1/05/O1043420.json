The following is the full text of the entry: LUTI, BENEDETTO (1666-1724) 1040 Male nude lying huddled on the ground Inscribed as follows: on the mount in two different 18th century hands \u2018Annibale\u2019 and Caracci\u2019; on the back of the mount in Richardson\u2019s hand \u2018Th.7. Fa.16 Zu.25. Y\u2019: in Barnard\u2019s hand \u2018No. 441.13 \u00bc by 8 1/4\u2019; in the hand of Uvedale Price \u2018Annibal Carracci\u2026This drawing belonged to U. Price Senior, was bought at his sale by Mr. Barnard. I bought it at Mr. Barnard\u2019s sale. U. Price\u2019; and again, probably in Price\u2019s hand \u2018the 3d night Lot 16\u2019; in a different hand \u2018Price\u2019 Red chalk 6 \u00bd x 13 \u00bc (165 x 336) Dyce 292 PROVENANCE J. Richardson Sr (Lugt 2184); U. Price Sr (see above); J. Barnard (Lugt 1420); U. Price Jr (Lugt 2048); Sir J. Reynolds (Lugt 2364); Dyce Bequest 1869 LITERATURE <i>Dyce Catalogue</i> no. 292; Reitlinger, p. 16, no. 31 (as by Annibale Carracci in both cases) The Uvedale Price Senior mentioned in the inscription was doubtless the grandfather of the Uvedale who wrote on the mount. He died in 1764. He was probably the owner of the Uvedale Price collection of drawings which was sold by auction, as Lugt states, on 5 April 1762, and it was presumably at that auction that Barnard bought our drawing. The words \u2018the 3d night Lot 16\u2019 on the back of the mount appear to be in the younder Uvedale Price\u2019s hand and must refer therefore to the Barnard Sale in February 1787, which lasted for seven nights. The catalogue entry reads \u2018Two Cannini and Pagini\u2019. Cannini is not a very convincing attribution for our drawing, and it is difficult to understand to which known artist the name pagini was intended to refer. Is is possible that Price made a mistake over the lot number, but the descriptions of the lots in the Barnard Catalogue are so loconic that it is impossible to identify the drawing in any other lot. The attribution to Annibale Carracci, which goes back at least as far as Uvedale Price Junior, and was maintained in the <i>Dyce Catalogue</i> and in Reitlinger, will hardly command the assent of modern scholars. The new attribution to Luti is based on the resemblance which the drawing bears to two studies of male nudes lying in similar huddled attitudes in the Uffizi (inventory nos. 15336 and 15341). Both these drawings are signed, and one of them is dated 1693, that is to say it was executed during Luti\u2019s first years in Rome. The drawings are illustrated in V. Moschini, \u2018Benedetto Luti\u2019, in <i>L\u2019Arte</i>, 26, 1923, pp. 92 and 93, figs. 2 and 3 (for a description of them see also <i>op. cit.</i> p. 95).",
