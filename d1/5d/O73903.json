Ring foot.\nThe sparsely applied patterns are chiefly geometric. Other motifs are typical of Samanid Khorasan, including knots of Solomon with trilobed palmettes extending from the sides. On the triangular facets  there are tight-knit chain patterns enclosing knots of Solomon framed by twin fillets and incised with dividers. On the diamond-shaped facets are decorations consisting of large roundels framed by scrolls carrying half-palmettes. The tiny rings projecting from each point were presumably intended for small pendentives in keeping with the Khorasan tradition of bejewelled vessels.\nThe opening has a geometric openwork pattern framed by a copper fillet.\nPatina: dark dull green sulphorous patches on a dark purplish red oxidized ground. One of the upper triangular facets has been cleaned which shows the original alloy to be olive yellow.",
