            "history_note": "Historical significance: Giambattista was one of the most renowned painters of eighteenth-century Italy. He studied in the workshop of Gregorio Lazzarini. However Tiepolo moved away from the classicising style of his master, creating instead works with a focus on tonal qualities in the manner employed by his contemporaries Giambattista Piazzetta and Giovanni Battista Pittoni. This follows in the tradition of the sixteenth-century artist Tiepolo. Tiepolo began his career painting a series of canvases depicting <i>Prophets</i> and <i>Apostles</i> for S Maria dei Derelitti, Venice, in 1715-16. He is documented on the register of the Venetian confraternity of painters in the following year. \n\nBy the 1720's Tiepolo's success at home brought many commissions from outside Venice. Between 1725-6 he worked in Udine, on a scheme of frescoes for the Patriarchal Palace (now the Archbishop's Palace) for the Patricarch Dionsio Dolfin. In 1730-31 Tiepolo worked in Milan producing works including frescoes for five ceilings in the Palazzo Archinto. During the 1740s, Tiepolo was at the height of his fame. He produced paintings indcluding  the <i> Family of Darius before Alexander</i> (1743) and the frescoes of <i>The meeting of Anthony and Cleopatra</i> and <i>The Banquet of Anthony and Cleopatra</i> for the Palazzo Labia, Venice. From 1750-3 Tiepolo worked in W\u00fcrzburg on a commission for frescoes of the ceiling and walls for the Kaisersaal of the Residenz at W\u00fcrzburg. Again in Venice, Tiepolo became the president of the Venetian Academy in 1756. In March, 1762, Tiepolo was summoned by Charles III of Spain (reigned 1759-88) to paint three ceiling frescoes in the Palacio Real, Madrid. He travelled that year with his sons, Giandomenico and Lorenzo, to work on the project. He was to remain in Spain until his death in 1770. Tiepolo's works ranged from frescoes and paintings on canvas of histories, mythologies and religious subjects. As well as these works, which were the result of commissions from patrons, Tiepolo also produced a series of etchings. Tiepolo was an expert printmaker. His output can be seen in the two main groups of etchings that he produced, the <i>Capricci</i>, a group of ten prints, and the 24 <i>Scherzi di fantasia</i>. Stylistically these works probably date to the 1730s or 1740s.\n\nThis is one of five drawings in the V&A collection related to frescoes in the Villa Loschi (now Zileri dal Verme) at Biron, near Vicenza, which Tiepolo produced in 1734 (see V&A inventory nos. D.1825.18-1885; D.1825.77-1825; D.1825.117-1885; D.1825.89-1885 for the other studies). In his catalogue of Tiepolo drawings in the V&A collection Knox writes that this group of drawings illustrate the artist's mature style of drawing in pen and wash in which he had developed a freedom of expression. \n\nThe drawing of <i>Virtue Crowning Honour</i> is for the fresco of the same subject in the <i>Salone</i> of the villa. The figures wear classical dress, the figure Honour appearing in roman armour. Honour is seated against a broken fluted column, which continues the classical feel of the composition. The drawing is very close in composition to the final version, with applications of wash anticipating the use of light and shade in the fresco. The posture and figure of Honour anticipate that of the Emperor in the fresco of <i>The Investiture of the Bishop of Harold</i> painted in the Residenze Kaisersaal, Wurzburg, by the artist in 1752.",
