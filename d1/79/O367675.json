The composition has a gold-coloured ground and the figure stands on a plinth inscribed 'CIMABUE'. A plain brown border surrounds the central composition with a woven gold-coloured inscription reading 'ROYAL WINDSOR TAPESTRY' and symbol a on the top and 'HERBERT BONE INVI' on the lower edge.\n\nThe figure wears a close-fitting liripipe hood and cloak with blue lining, leggings and a short patterned tunic with elaborate gold-coloured edging. Similar decoration can be seen on his belt and purse, shoe decoration and leggings' bands. The figure is bearded and shows a full fringe of hair beneath his hood. \n\nThe tapestry is finely woven in wool (figure and border) and silk (background and figure details) on a cotton warp at 24 threads to the inch. Interlocking tapestry technique was employed at colour intersections.",

Registered File number 1990/106.\n\nThe design was originally made by Herbert Bone in 1881 as part of a set of mosaics depicting saints and historic figures to be made by Dr A. Salviati, formerly an eminent Venetian lawyer whose work can be seen in St Paul's Cathedral, the Albert Memorial, both in London, and All Saints Church, Windsor. Bone's designs do not appear to have been used by Salviati but tapestries were made from the designs some years later.\n\nAccording to Gordon G. Cunningham (The Royal Windsor Tapestry Manufactory 1876-1890, Vol. IV, Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead Historical Records Publications, 1979) this panel was hitherto lost, last recorded as part of a screen exhibited at the Chicago World Fair in 1893. However, from the rather poor illustration from the catalogue, reproduced by Cunningham, this panel would appear to be a different weaving. It is possible, therefore, that more than one version was woven by the Royal Windsor Tapestry Works.",
