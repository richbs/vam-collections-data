One of the questions voted on in the referendum was whether the Workers' Militia should be dismissed.  The answer was an overwhelming 'yes' because this armed force was regarded a symbol of the oppression of the K\u00e1d\u00e1r-regime that followed the failed 1956 revolution. The slate-grey uniformed and armed Workers' Militia was established in 1957 with the aim 'to defend the state of workers and peasants'. Service in this organisation, which replaced the special police force (karhatalom) of the former R\u00e1kosi-regime, was voluntary, but offered participants some career advantages.\n  \nThe poster demonstrates the active participation of the Alliance of Free Democrats in the preparations of the referendum. The artist represents the Workers' Militia as a wolf-like set of false teeth, implying that the militia is an old organisation that belongs to the past.",
