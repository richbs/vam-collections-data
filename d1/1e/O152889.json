He became an important Abstract Expressionist practicing both painting and printmaking. During the 1950s he established a reputation as one of America\u2019s foremost practitioners in woodcut. His woodcuts were typically large and painterly in expression, as can be seen in this image. \n\nOstia Antica is the ancient harbour at the mouth of the river Tiber (the Latin word for \u2018mouth\u2019 is \u2018ostia\u2019), originally a harbour for Rome, but the shoreline silted up over time and the town is now at least three kilometres from the beach. Yunkers made a series of woodcuts inspired by  the place. In an interview for the Smithsonian  Archives of  American Art  in 1969,  he described it as a ghost town, adding  \u201cstill today there are inlaid symbols the size of this carpet where they had their stalls, in the fishermen\u2019s there were little fishes, in the shoemaker\u2019s there were shoes. Beautiful things that you walk on, and it\u2019s absolutely empty\u201d .  The colours and composition of this image suggest deep dark water with sudden pools of light or maybe these \u2018inlaid symbols\u2019.",
