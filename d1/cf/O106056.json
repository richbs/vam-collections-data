Below this stands a girl wearing a hat and dressed in blue tights and ballet shoes and a calf-length yellow and blue dress with a square neckline, pointing upwards with her left hand to a sunflower, her right hand on her hip. Behind the sunflowers in the areas of sky there are five groups of musical notations.",

Established performers who could afford it all had their own posters designed and printed so that they could be pasted up in the towns they were appearing with overposted slips noting the venue. Performers' contracts of the day often stipulated that entertainers had to provide their advertising material, sending it to the theatre manager at the venue before their appearance.\n\nThis brightly coloured poster clearly aimed to capture the spirit of the act even if it doesn't explain how the sunflowers revolved or how they were made. Presumably the act consisted of the girl and the white-faced clown, the girl acting as a 'straight' foil to the comical musical business of the clown. The unusual long, thin shape of the poster was also designed to be eye-catching.",
