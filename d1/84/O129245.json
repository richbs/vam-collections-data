            "public_access_description": "The silk taffeta of this evening cape is of exceptional quality, and is pieced to create an unusually constructed loose fitting full-length cape.  It has a double-layer of fabric, forming deep folds at the front, with draw-string taffeta ribbons at the hood (which can either be worn up around the head or loosely around the shoulders).  \n\nHubert de Givenchy (b. 1927) met Audrey Hepburn during the shoot for the film Sabrina in 1953.  He went on to design almost all the clothes she wore in her films, including Breakfast at Tiffany's and Funny Face.  In this film Audrey Hepburn wears a cape identical to the one shown here.  One of the most iconic images is of Hepburn's face peeping from the cape, her blue gloved hands folded beneath.\n\nIn 1985, Audrey Hepburn said: \"My only merit is to have spent thirty years wearing dresses by Monsieur de Givenchy, whose talents and friendship I value most highly\".",
