This monument, which was erected by Cardinal Francesco Barberini, consists of a sarcophagus, surmounted by a broken pedestal on which two putti are seated holding a medallion portrait of Holste.  \n\nHolste was converted to Catholicism in 1627 and moved to Rome entering the household of Cardinal Barbarini, a former papal nuncio. Holste became the librarian to Count Barbarini and served on a number of papal missions. In particular he was sent by Pope Alexander VII to Innsbruck to meet Queen Charlotte of Sweden and accept her abjuration of Protestantism. \n\nThe inscription of this medallion refers to this mission and the image may in fact be an allegorical illustration of this event. It could be read as representing either Truth leading the World to the Catholic Religion and Rome or Truth leading Queen Charlotte away from the World towards the Catholic Religion and Rome.",
