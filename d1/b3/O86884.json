            "public_access_description": "This caricature shows Terry Scott (1927-1994) as Miss Gooseberry Pimple in Babes in the Wood by Emile Littler at the Oxford New Theatre, December 1960. It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years. Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn\u2019t needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nTerry Scott, the star of television\u2019s Terry and June with June Whitfield, began in repertory and worked in variety and summer shows. He appeared in many films including Carry On Sergeant, was well-know in radio variety for his little boy character, and was a popular pantomime dame.",
