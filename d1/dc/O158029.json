            "public_access_description": "Tureens are an invention of the 1690s, and were probably introduced at the court of Louis XIV. They were designed for use with a ladle, and remained on the table throughout the dinner. Tureens were passed around the table and handled by diners who undoubtedly admired the elaborate decoration and matching ladles. Sauce tureens, such as the present pair, are comparatively rare, and were introduced somewhat later than their larger counterparts.\n\nThe style of this pair of tureens is inspired by ancient Roman decoration and shows several typical elements of the Neoclassical style which became fashionable in the third quarter of the 18th century: Rams masks, hoof feet and Vitruvian scrolls. The overall composition of the set is typical for its maker Thomas Heming whose designs use the classical vocabulary in a rather distinct and playful way. Rather than applying the classical motifs to the functional carcass as mere decoration they become a defining part of the design. The ram masks for example function as handles with drapery arranged around the horns to add additional support.\n\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.\nOn long-term loan to Los Angeles County Museum from 2010.",
