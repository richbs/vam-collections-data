Rulers in many countries encouraged them to immigrate, by offering freedom of religion, and legal and tax privileges.  These German immigrants usually kept their own distinctive costumes.\n\nThe most conspicuous part of the dress of Saxon women in Transylvania was a large circular piece of jewellery, called a Heftel.  Originally it was just a simple clasp, used to fasten the bodice.  By the 17th century it had developed into a huge pendant, still worn in the same position, but now supported by a velvet band round the neck.  Unlike much traditional jewellery, the stones in these pieces are often genuine gems, rather than coloured glass.  The Heftel was intended to show the wealth of its owner, as well as her ethnic identity.\n\nThis Heftel is set with a large amethyst in the centre.  It was probably made in the late 17th century, but it is very difficult to date these pieces accurately, as the same designs were used up to the end of the 19th century.",
