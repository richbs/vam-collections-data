The  rise in prices and the creation of annual privately hired theatre boxes caused riots that  lasted three months and ultimately led to Kemble removing the private boxes and reducing  the price of tickets. This print is a satire of these riots and uses the nursery rhyme This is the House that Jack Built.",
