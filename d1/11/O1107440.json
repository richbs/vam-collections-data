The publication contains illustrations of animals, alongside brief descriptions of their appearance, habits and habitats, accompanied by a number of illustrative vignettes, used mainly as tailpieces. \n\nThe text accompanying the illustration (in the publication) notes that: \n'<i>We beg leave to make out acknowledgements to Mr Pennant for the drawing of this animal, which he assures us was drawn from the life; and we doubt not, therefore, its being a faithful representation. \nThe species of the Jackal is difussed, with some variety, through almost every part of Asia; and is found in Barbary, and other parts of Africa, as far as the Cape of Good Hope. \nAlthough it is one of the most numerous of all the wild animals in the East, there is scarcely any less known in Europe, or more confusedly described by natural historians.</i>' \n\nTaken from: Beilby, Ralph and Bewick, Thomas. <u>A General History of Quadrupeds</u>. Newcastle upon Tyne. Third Edition, 1792.\n\nHistorical significance: Thomas Bewick was the first engraver to exploit fully the advantages of end-grain wood (the wood is cut across, rather than along, the grain). Once it had been proved that the technique could rival the fine effects of metal engraving, the advantages of wood engraving to the book trade were quickly recognised. Allowing both text and illustration to be printed in one operation, it ousted the intaglio process as the favourite for book illustration and was only superseded at the end of the nineteenth century when methods of photomechanical reproduction were developed.",
