Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. Above all they had to have the means of attaching the cord of the container. This katabori  (shape carving) netsuke of a tightly curled rat has all these qualities and is an ideal netsuke form. \nFrom the 1700s onwards, many more makers signed their netsukes. This example is signed Masanao. It is one of a small but distinctive regional group from Yamada, Ise province. The line originated with Masanao I (1815-90), although there were four other Masanaos, as well as various pupils who used the same 'masa' character in their name. Generations of Masanao craftsmen worked almost exclusively in wood, especially boxwood. They made detailed and realistic netsuke, such as this one. The Masanao line produced a wide range of subjects, although they specialised in animals. The coiled rat was a favourite theme.",
