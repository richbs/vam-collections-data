            "public_access_description": "Nicholas Hilliard was never employed full-time by the monarchy, so he was forced to set up his business in the City of London, much like any other craftsman. He thus lived by erratic commissions rather than being supported by the luxury of a steady pension. Many of Hilliard's sitters were none the less from the social class that centred on the court, and this miniature is a rare example of a portrait of a person from the very different world of the city merchants and their families. With her tall black hat, smocked stomacher and apron, this woman is typical of her class. Her dress is enlivened not by elaborate jewellery but by means of naturalistic touches in the form of roses and other flowers tucked into the corners of her dress. From the gold ring, which hangs from a black thread attached to a yellow knot at her breast, it is conceivable that the portrait commemorates her marriage. The Latin inscription, Videtur et Vere est, literally means \u2018it seems and truly is\u2019. It could be her family motto, meaning something on the lines of \u2018free from deception\u2019, but it could also imply that this portrait is indeed an accurate likeness.",

Full Citation:\n\n\u201cNICHOLAS HILLIARD\n\n<b>104 Unknown Lady</b>, 1602\n\n<i>Victoria & Albert Museum (P.26-1975)</i>\nVellum stuck onto playing card, oval, 59 mm x 44 mm, 2 x 1 in.\n\nA portrait clearly painted from life and in Hilliard\u2019s best direct, free manner.  Oliver\u2019s influence is apparent only in the tight handling of the hair.  There is not flagging in spontaneity of response or technical brilliant if a sitter interested in Hilliard, which clearly this young woman did.\n\nThis is a rare miniature of a person not of the court but of the city.  Typical of this dress is the tall black hat, smocked stomacher and apron.  Comparison may be made with the watercolours of such a costume that appear in the <i>album amicorum</i> of the period (see J. L. Nevinson, \u201cThe Dress of the Citizens of London 1549-1640\u201d, <i>Collecteana Londinensia</i>, Studies presented to R. Merrifield, London and Middlesex Archaeological Society, 1978, pp. 265-80).  The dress is enlivened by naturalistic touches in the form of roses and flowers tucked into the corners of her neckline.  The suggestion (Clifford-Smith cited below) that the <i>Vere</i> in the motto refers to the family of the Earls of Oxford can surely be discounted, together with the suggested identification as Elizabeth Trentham, second wife of Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford.\n\nConceivably the portrait commemorates a marriage as gold ring hangs from a black thread attached to a yellow bow at her neckline.  The enigmatic motto, \u201cIt seems and truly is\u201d (?), would not exclude this interpretation.  The miniature is in its contemporary turned ivory box, the lid of which is missing.\n\nINSCRIBED: In gold around the top, left: <i>Videtur et Vere est</i>; right: <i>Ano Dni. 1602.</i>\n\nCOLLECTIONS: With Danton Gerault [n.b. this is a mis-spelling of Danton Guerault, who was a dealer]; sold from the collection of Mr S. H. V. Hickson, Sotheby\u2019s 29th March 1965 (lot 75); previous history unknown; bequeathed to the V&A by Mrs Doris Herschorn, 1965.\n\nLITERATURE: Edwin [actually Edwina] Clifford-Smith, \u201cHilliard, Heretics and Humphry\u201d, <i>Ivory Hammer</i>, 3, 1964-65, pp. 198-99.\u201d",
