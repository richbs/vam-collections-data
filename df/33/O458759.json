            "physical_description": "Circular, flat topped box with slightly raised vertical foot rim, decorated with figurative scanes inlaid in mother-of-pearl on a black lacquer ground. \n\nThe material of the core is not known, but it appears to carry a fabric covering, with a layer of grey material between the fabric and the black lacquer. The interior of both halves is covered in plain red lacquer. The upper half fits over a raised flange on the lower. A line of twisted silver wire acts as strenghtening at the outer edge of the foot, and round the rim of both halves. A double line of twistes silver wire surrounds the central panel on the top. \n\nThe outside of the foot is decorated with small circular pieces of mother-of-pearl. The lower half is decorated with four lobed cartouches containing birds and flowers in mother-of-pearl with incised details. These are set against a ground of hexagonal diaper, each hexagon containing a small pointed star, usually of five small pieces. \n\nOn the sides of the upper half are four lobed cartouches containing figures in landscapes, with incised detail. These are set against diaper grounds: two of these grounds are composed of hexagons formed from  intersecting circles, with central five-pointed stars, the other two are intersecting circle diapers (<i>qian wen </i>) with central four-pointed stars. The cartouches on both halves do not align exactly when the box is closed. \n\nThe central panel on the top shows a man riding a horse from left to right, surrounded by eight attendants who carry luggage, a folding stool, a ceremonial umbrella and other signs of rank. Four of them wear the tall hats of official <i>yamen</i> runners. The front attendant carries an object with the incised character <i>shu</i> (document). These insignia identify the horseman as an official. In the foreground are balaustrade and rocks. In the left background are trees and rocks, In the right background are two pavillions, the front one with two men and the rear one with two women.\n\nThe figures and tree trunks are composed of fairly large pieces of mother-of-pearl with incised details, while the rocks in the foreground are made up from an outline of thin strips, within which are two lines of irregular mother-of-pearl chips. The leaves are composed of a single piece of mother-of-pearl. \n\nA column on the rear pavillion carries five incised characters.",
