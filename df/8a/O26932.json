Later the idea of bull and bear markets, of rising and falling price, was introduced into the game. Pit has 63 cards arranged in seven suits of nine. Each suit has the name of a crop and a number, printed in red. Players attempt to collect sets of cards representing commodities traded on the American Corn Exchange: wheat, barley, corn, rye, oats, flax and hay. The game is made more exciting by the inclusion of bonus and penalty cards featuring a bull and a bear.\n\nCards are exchanged by any two players wishing to trade the same number of cards and as all players are trying to trade at once the game often develops into a free for all.",
