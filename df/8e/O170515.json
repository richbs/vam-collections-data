            "public_access_description": "Tea-drinking, introduced into Britain in the late 17th century, became widespread during the 18th century.  Since tea caddies were placed on the table as tea was served, they were often highly decorative.  A great variety of wooden caddies were made between 1780 and 1810 as tea became cheaper and more widely used.  A. Hepplewhite & Co. published designs for both \u2018tea caddies\u2019 and \u2018tea chests\u2019, which were usually larger, in The Cabinet-Maker and Upholsterer\u2019s Guide, 1788 (2nd edition 1789, 3rd Edition 1794). This tea caddy has painted decoration with a landscape, flowers and trophies, and two sets of initials painted on the inner lid. Judging by the quality of the painting and the presence of the initials this caddy was not professionally decorated but probably painted by an amateur at home.",
