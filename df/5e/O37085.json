Sewn to the right side of the mouth is a tongue of pink felt, now faded to beige.  Around the neck is a silk ribbon, slightly frayed at the ends.\n\nThe toy is made of a number of parts machine and hand sewn together to create the shape of the head, body and limbs.  The front of the head is in one piece with the nose panel sewn down the front and around to the throat; the tongue is sewn into the mouth.  This gives a long face with square spout.  Ears are separately sewn on.  The back of the head, though part of the part, is stitched from between the ears to the base of the neck to shape it.  The body is in four parts.  Two parts, sewn up the centre of the back, are the back to the base of the tail and the outside of the front legs.  The other two parts are the inside of the front legs and the chest and stomach, all sewn together and sewn to the body back.   The back legs, each of two parts sewn together, are sewn to the body and likewise the tail.  The body and the head are sewn together at the neck where the marks are printed.  This line is covered by the ribbon.",
