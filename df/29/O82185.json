This medium is more durable than paper. Although these portraits were called 'plumbagos', meaning black lead, they were usually drawn in graphite and sometimes in ink. This portrait is done in graphite. \n\n\u2018Plumbagos' developed in the Netherlands in the late 16th century within the print trade. They developed from the printmakers\u2019 original drawings on paper, from which a print would have been engraved. 'Plumbagos' were introduced into England when the monarchy was restored in 1660, by printmakers who returned home from exile abroad. As the taste for 'plumbagos' became established, artists who were not printmakers also began to produce them.\n\nDavid Paton worked in Scotland from about 1660 to 1695. Mainly he drew highly finished miniatures in 'plumbago', some of which were copied from pictures. Paton accompanied The Hon. William Tollemache, youngest son of the Duchess of Lauderdale, on the Grand Tour (a cultural tour of Europe made by young gentlemen). There are a few examples of Paton's work at the Lauderdale's home, Ham House in London.",
