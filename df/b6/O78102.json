The exact date of production of this textile is not known but stylistically it can be dated between 1896 and 1900, when it was illustrated in the Art Journal magazine. \n\nThe design of this textile shows traditional repeating motifs reminiscent of 16th and 17th century Turkish velvets.  Its name also indicates an Eastern theme and may have be based on the epic Persian poemThe Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t of Omar Khayy\u00e1m, translated by the British poet Edward Fitzgerald and first published in 1859. C.H. Townsend (1851-1928), the designer of this textile, was chiefly known as an architect.  His most famous creations are the Whitechapel Art Gallery and The Horniman Museum, both in London, two of the most important British Arts and Crafts buildings.  He produced only a few large-scale designs for textiles.\n\nThe firm of Alexander Morton & Co. was one of the most forward-looking manufacturers of the late 19th century.  It bought designs from leading artistic figures of the day  in line with the firm's policy to produce innovative furnishings for artistic homes. This is  part of the 'Cessnock' range of heavyweight weaves for hangings, all of which were made with the same yarns and texture. It was also referred to as a 'Darvel tapestry', named after the place where it had been woven.",
