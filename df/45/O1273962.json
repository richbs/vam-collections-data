She wrote the majority of the twenty-three Original Peter Rabbit Books between 1901 and 1913. The Tale of Peter Rabbit (Frederick Warne, 1902) is her most famous and best-loved tale.  \n\nPotter produced many evocative watercolour studies of the Lake District landscape. She particularly delighted in recording the effect of crisp, white snow on the fells and fields as can be seen from the many watercolour drawings of such in the Linder Bequest. This study dates from her stay at Hill Top farmhouse during the early months of 1909. She had bought the property in 1905 but did not make Near Sawrey her permanent home until after she married in 1913.",
