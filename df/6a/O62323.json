He supports himself on his bent right foot on the prostrate demon Apasmara or Muyalaka, who signifies the power of ignorance and materialism; whilst the left leg is raised to the height of the waist. The figure is encircled by an elliptical aureole of flames (jvala mala). A third eye is faintly discernible on the forehead. The front right hand is in abhaya mudra (giving assurance), and a cobra is coiled round the forearm; the right hand holds the kettledrum (damaru) between the thumb and the second finger; the rear left hand holds the flame (agni) in a cup or saucer; the front arm is stretched across the body in the gesture, gaja or danda hasta. The hair is dressed close to the crown and surmounted by a fan-shaped headdress of Kondrai leaves (Cassia fistula L), bearing a cobra, a Datura flower and a crescent moon. There is no siras cakra or disc behind the head  for hanging garlands. Six braided locks which flow outwards on each side, interspersed with flowers, are cast separately and riveted to the back of the head. A small figure of the river-goddess Ganga is poised on the aureole itself paying homage to Siva. A thin sash tucked into the waistband has its ends flowing to one side. The costume consists of tiger-skin drawers worn with a girdle, the latter with short beaded festoons. Other details include keyura armlets; bracelets at the elbows; an ear pendant (patra-kundala) attached to the left ear only, the right ear-lobe being extended without ornament; padasara on the feet. The image is mounted on a circular double petalled lotus pedestal which is cast in one piece with a rectangular base, the latter with fittings at the side for attachment to a processional carrier.",

Its function was to create, maintain and cyclically destroy the elemental forces of the universe. Ringed by a flaming aureole, Shiva dances on the prostrate figure of the demon-dwarf Apasmara, who personifies ignorance and materialism.\n \nShiva in this form displays four arms and a third eye is discernible on the forehead. In his upper hands Shiva holds the double-sided drum (\u2018damaru\u2019) to mark time and the flame to signify destruction. His lower hands gesture reassurance and protection.\n\nShiva\u2019s piled-up hair is surmounted by a fan-shaped headdress of kondrai leaves, sacred to him. The radiating locks of hair, which evoke the energy of the dance, are separately cast and riveted to the back of the head. \n\nThe image is mounted on an elliptical double-petal lotus pedestal which is cast in one piece with a rectangular base. The metal rings on the base allowed the image to be secured onto a palanquin during processional use. On such occasions the image would have been ritually bathed, dressed in fine silks and garlanded with fresh flowers in preparation for the parade.",
