One response was the invention of fritware, also called stone paste and quartz paste. \n\nIn fritware, the main ingredient was fine quartz powder made by grinding sand or pebbles. Small quantities of white clay and a glassy substance known as frit were added \u2013 the clay to give plasticity, the frit to bind the body after firing. Unlike high-fired Chinese porcelain, low-fired fritware was soft and porous, but like porcelain it was white all the way through and could be used to make convincing substitutes.\n\nIn the 12th and early 13th centuries, fritware was used in Kashan and other centres in Iran to produce fine wares decorated in an astonishing range of styles. \n\nThe Kashan potters\u2019 mastery of both fritware and the lustre technique is illustrated by this large dish. The figure, a servant offering a piece of food, stands out boldly against the pattern because it is surrounded by a solid band of lustre.",
