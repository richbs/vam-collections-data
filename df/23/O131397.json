They sent works to the RA from the same London address (Eldon Lodge, Victoria Road); Alfred between 1852 and 1864, and Edward between 1870 and 1874. Alfred Corbould exhibited twenty works at the RA between 1844 and 1864: portraits, landscapes, but mostly sporting subjects. Confusingly, another Alfred Corbould, exhibiting between 1831 and 1875, was also a sporting painter.\n\n<b>Bessie Grieve</b> \nP39-1981 Neg HJ786 \nCanvas, oval, 30 x 25 cm (11 13/16 x 9 7/8 ins) \nGiven by Mrs Audrey Grieve 1981 \n\nBoth sitters were members of the famous family of theatrical designers. The Department holds a large collection of designs by the Grieves for Charles Kean's productions of Shakespeare and other plays at the Princess's Theatre, London, dating between 1853 and 1859. Miss Grieve, later Mrs Peter Hicks, compiled the Grieve family tree now in the British Library. Mrs Audrey Grieve also gave two watercolours to the Museum in 1981 by T W Grieve, both of Margate subjects (P36, P3 7 -1981). Despite the difference in the size of the two portraits, it seems probable that they were painted at the same time and as companion pictures.\"",
