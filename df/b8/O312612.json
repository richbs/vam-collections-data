The production of this bust in lead, a relatively cheap material, implies that other versions might exist, but none is recorded, though four plaster versions and a terracotta version are known. The mahogany pedestal dates from the early 19th century.\n\nDr Johnson, the literary colossus of his time, is most renowed for the publication of his Dictionary in 1775. Johnson was a friend of the sculptor Nollekens, but hated sitting for his portrait.",
