It is from the series 'Gleaner's Lexicon' in which Sandra Matthews gathers images of disparate objects and reassembles them to create images suggestive of eccentric forms archiving. As here, the images from this series show a four-part grouping of objects that are separate and yet infer subtle inter-relations. As Matthews writes:\n'Each of these constellations is structured to suggest harmonies and dissonances, affinities and tensions, possible and improbable narratives. Ultimately I am interested in the build-up and breakdown of systems of order, and in the process of making meaning itself.'",
