            "public_access_description": "Snuff, or powdered tobacco, was widely popular throughout Europe from the 17th century. Sniffed from the back of the hand, from pinched fingers or from a spoon, snuff was enjoyed on social occasions and would be placed on the table or passed around a group. \n\nAlthough commercially-produced snuff was available, many 'snuffers' preferred to make their own. Snuff rasps such as this enabled a portion of snuff to be prepared at any time by grinding a bundle of tobacco leaves on the metal grater or rasp. The small size and weight of this example suggest it was designed to be portable. A sliding panel, now missing, would have covered the rasp while not in use.\n\nSnuff-taking was a largely upper-class pursuit, and snuff accessories were often highly decorated. This example of carved teak is inlaid with mother of pearl in the form of stylized flower-heads and hearts. Brass-wire stringing is woven amongst the larger motifs, and forms flowers along the edges of the piece. The back is carved with a man shooting a stag, and even the iron grater is decorated with pierced holes in diagonal lines.",
