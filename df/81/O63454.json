It is finely sewn and is in pristine condition.  It is particularly important as there are no other examples of men's nightshirts dating fromthe second half of the century in the collection.  It fills a vital gap in the portrayal of a gentleman's wardrobe.  It also complements the nightgowns belonging to Mr Coutts which date from the 1820s, showing how little the basic construction of this item of dress had changed in over fifty years.  For this reason the fact that it is signed and dated is also very important.",
