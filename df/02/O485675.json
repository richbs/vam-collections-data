Registered File number 31783/1901.\n\nNote on register:\nA lady's cloak, or coat, of woven silk brocade (<i>kesi</i>), with baskets of fruit and flowers hung with ribbons and tassels displayed in bright colours upon a dark blue ground. The flowers are executed in the charming naturalistic style which manifests especially in the Qianlong period (1736-95), boldly outlined, but with most of the intrinsic details filled in by the painter's brush. The fruit consists of bunches of grapes with vine leaves and tendrils, and of the Buddha's hand citron with its bird  and blossom. Among the flowers may be noticed the pink lotus with a yellow marguerite daisy, the magnificent tree peony, the herbaceous peony, the fairy narcissus and the sacred fungus of many colours with a sprig of bamboo etc. The borders of the cloak are bound round with a band of orchids woven in similar materials of a somewhat coarser fabric. the coat is lined in pale pink, a colour reserved for the gentler sex in Chinese costume.",
