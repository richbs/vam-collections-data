The top of the cushion is of pile on pile silk velvet with a Gothic design of large stylised roses, each with three concentric rings of petals springing from knotted stems which divide to encircle the rose below. Smaller roses, with only two rings of petals, branch from the stem to fill the interspaces. There are four large roses on the cover. The back of the cover is of bright green velvet. Within the cover, the red velvet has a lining of red satin. The edges are bound with a red silk plaited cord with one strand of off-white. Hanging from the cord at each of the four corners are tassels of red silk and metal thread, and silver-gilt strip around a yellow silk core. Weft and ground warp of yellow silk.
