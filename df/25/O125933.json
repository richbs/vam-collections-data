(some col.)\nExhibition catalogue\n<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, pp. 221, 226-230\nThe following is an extract from the text of the entry:\n\n\"The sketch-book half-bound in green leather, gold tooled, marbled boards. It bears a label inside the front cover: S. & J. Fuller, Temple of Fancy, 34, Rathbone Place, London. A button with the remains of a green silk ribbon tie is sewn on to the outside of the back cover. The paper watermarked: J WHATMAN 1832. The sketch-book was used mainly in Sussex in July 1835. \nExcept where otherwise noted, the inscriptions are in pencil; they are all written by the artist. \n\nInside front cover inscribed with the measurements: <i>18 8 1/4 26 \u00bc by 20. all but 1/8-26 1/4 by 20-</i>; also <i>In</i> [or <i>Sn</i>] and <i>little Hampton Pier</i> (referring to p. 1). \n\np. 1 A view of the sea with wooden jetties in the foreground. Pen and ink. \nInscribed at top left <i>little Hampton Pier</i>. \np. 2 Blank. \np. 3 A man seen from behind lying on the seashore and looking out to sea, where boats are to be seen. Pencil. \np. 4 Blank. \np. 5 A view of a seaside village: a tree in the foreground, and buildings beyond, with a boat in a creek or basin to the right and the masts of other shipping seen beyond the buildings. Pencil. \np. 6 Blank, but for a slight carry-over (about 7 mm. wide) of the drawing on p. 7. \np. 7 Left, a thatched cottage with a high chimney; right, figures seated on a stile or gate in the road, and trees beyond. Pencil. \np. 8 Inscribed (referring to p. 7 or p. 9) <i>a Sussex Cottage. </i>\np. 9 A thatched half-timbered cottage with a high chimney, and trees beyond. Pencil and water-colour. \np. 10 Inscribed at top left (referring to p. 9) <i>Sussex Cottage</i> and at top right (referring to p. 11) <i>Middleton Church Coast of Sussex-in part washed away by the Sea see Charlotte Smith's Sonnet 10 July</i>. \nThe leaf comprised by pp. 9 and 10 is stuck behind a small guard strip on which p. 11 is finished. It has cracked, or been cut, along the strip. It is not clear whether a page is missing from the sketch-book at this point. Charlotte Smith's 'Sonnet written in the Church-Yard of Middleton', which is more specifically illustrated by the drawing on p. 13, reads: \n\nPress'd by the moon, mute arbitress of tides, \nWhilst the loud equinox its power combines; \nThe sea no more its swelling surf confines, \nBut o'er the shrinking land sublimely rides! \nThe wild blast rising from the western cave \nDrives the huge billows from their heaving bed, \nTears from their grassy tomb the village dead, \nAnd breaks the silent sabbath of the grave! \nWith shells and sea-weed mingled on the shore, \nLo, their bones whiten in the frequent wave; \nBut vain to them the winds and waters rave, \nThey hear the warring elements no more: \nWhilst I am doom'd, by life's long storm oppress'd, \nTo gaze with envy on their gloomy rest! \n\np. 11 Middleton Church. Pencil and water-colour. \t \np. 12 Inscribed at top left <i>Look at back of Sussex Cottage</i> [that is, presumably, at p. 10, where there is a reference to Charlotte Smith's sonnet].  Inscribed at top right <i>Middleton Churchyard and form of a sceleton in the bank of the Churchyard</i> [Mr. Gerard Young of Flansham, Sussex, supplied the reading <i>skeleton</i> and drew attention to the connection with Charlotte Smith's sonnet]. \np. 13 A chalk bank in Middleton churchyard, with the form of a skeleton in it. Pencil and water-colour. (See also pp. 10 and 12) \np. 14 Middleton Church. Pencil. A drawing from the same aspect as p. 11.  The leaf comprised by pp. 13 and 14 is stuck to an irregularly torn guard strip and may be cut from a large sheet of paper and inserted here in place of a torn-out sheet. \np. 15 Middleton Church.

A drawing from the same aspect as that on p. 11. \np. 16 Inscribed (referring to p. 17) <i>Arundul Castle</i>. \np. 17 View in the grounds of Arundel Castle: in the centre foreground a square tower beside a bridge; on a ridge to right, above trees, another part of the castle.

This was the house at Kingston-on-Thames of Dr. Philip Fisher, Master of Charterhouse and brother of Dr. John Fisher, the late Bishop of Salisbury. Mrs. Philip Fisher had invited Maria Constable to stay with her after her visit to Arundel with her father (Beckett, VI, pp. 270-1).

A. Tierney, chaplain to the Duke of Norfolk, who published <i>The History and Antiquities of ... Arunde</i>l in 1834; and the Rev. Edmund Cartwright who contributed 'The Parochial Topography of the Rape of Bramber, 1830' to James Dallaway's <i>History of the Western Division of the County of Sussex</i>. Mr. Gerard Young has pointed out that the Rev. Robert Hardy (1767-1843) was Vicar of Walberton and a friend of William Hayley.\n\nNOTE ON THE SKETCH-BOOK NO. 382 [316-1888]\n\nThe chronological sequence of dated pages in the sketch-book is: July 13 p.19 Arundel; July 14 pp. 21, 23, 25 and 50 all of Fittleworth; July 16 pp. (27), 29 and 31 of Fittleworth; July 19 p. 33 Arundel; July 27 pp. 37, 46 and 48 Canbury House, Kingston-on- Thames. All these dates fall within the visit which Constable paid to George Constable at Arundel or his subsequent journeys to accompany Maria to and from the Fishers' house at Kingston. The drawing of Littlehampton in the British Museum (L.B. 18a) referred to in the note on No. 378 [272-1888] appears to bear a watermark of 1832 and, though cut on the left, to have come from a sketch-book. If so, it may have been extracted from this book, at the position noted between the present pp. 38 and 39.\"",
