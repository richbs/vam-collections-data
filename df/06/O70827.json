Keys once held in the right hand are now missing.\n[Statue] The saint stands on a sloping base resting on his left foot and steps forward with his right foot.  His head with the distinctive forelock and open mouth is slightly inclined towards the book which is held in the right hand.  With the forefinger of his left hand the saint seems to turn the page, and he  would probably have held the keys in this hand. Over a long robe he wears a cloak which is caught at his chest and held by a clasp.  The cloak falls over his right hand and is drawn across the body in deep angular curves; it falls in tubular folds towards his feet. The hollow figure is made of a creamy coloured clay, the back flattened and with an oval shaped hole (35x24cm). The terracotta is approximately 3cm thick.  On the inside, between the head and the neck is a rectangular hole for a fixingperhaps an iron bar to stabilize the wet clay, which was removed before firing.  The head, the two hands, including the book and the clasp were separately modelled and then inserted or attached. The keys, probably held in the left hand, and the thumb of the right hand are missing.  The left foot is slightly chipped. Some overpaint was removed in 1959 (Departmental records).  The surface still has several layers of overpaint which reflect the original polychromy: a red cloak with a blue lining, and a green robe, both with gilded borders.  The cloak shows traces of patterns of wax applications. The clasp is gilded under a later green paint.  The face and the protruding bare feet are painted in natural flesh tones, while the hair and the beard are painted grey.",

It probably formed part of a cycle of Apostles (Jesus Christ's first followers) positioned high up on pilasters or piers. It may have been similar to an ensemble of terracotta figures preserved in the choir and aisles of St Martin's Church in Landshut, Bavaria, in southern Germany. \n\nTerracotta sculpture flourished in Bavaria in the period 1400-1500, particularly in the Ducal cities of Straubing and Landshut. This terracotta figure was probably produced in a busy Landshut workshop. It seems likely that many were made, but only a few are known today.",

            "history_note": "Bought from Colli Brothers, Innsbruck, along with A.36-1910 and A.38-1910, [see Williamson 1988, pp. 178-81, no. 52], and W.52 to 54-1910 for a total of \u00a3473 in 1910.\n\nHistorical significance: Both figures probably formed part of a cycle of Apostles positioned high up on pilasters or piers, similar to the ensemble of terracotta figures preserved in the choir and aisles of the St Martin's church in Landshut (see below).\nWhen first acquired in 1910 these two figures were described as South German, early sixteenth century.  M\u00fcller (1930, p. 199) classified the figures as Upper Austrian.  Ress (1955, p. 76) first associated them with the cycle of the terracotta figures in Landshut in Bavaria and suggested an origin in the same workshop, active in the second half of the fifteenth century.  Baxandall agreed with his observations (1974, p. 24).\nAlthough the figures of Sts Peter and Paul (h. about 170cm) from the Landshut cycle are larger than A.37 and A.38-1910, they are close in style.  The workshop seems to have produced figures in various sizes, but using a similar stylistic formula. A fragment of a head of St Peter (h. 12cm) from a group of the Agony in the Garden was recently acquired by the Bayerisches Nationalmuseum in Munich (Kahsnitz 1993, p. 22, ill. on p. 23; idem. 1994, p. 232).  In its close similarity to the London Apostles, it does not necessarly represent - as suggested by Kahsnitz - a later stage in the stylistic development of the workshop, but is more probably a product in a smaller format in an analogous style.\nTwo other figures, a St Mary Magdalene (h. 115cm) and a St Martha (h. 107cm) in the Historisches Museum in Vienna, said to have come from the cathedral of St Stephen, have similarly modelled faces to those of A.37 and A.38-1910. (Tietz 1931, fig. 667, 668; Exh. Prague 1991/92, nos. 24, 25). Ress (1955, p. 81) suggested they might come from the same cycle, although this could only be established by technical investigation of the figures, or if documentary evidence comes to light.\nTerracotta sculpture flourished in Bavaria in the fifteenth century, particularly in the Ducal cities of Straubing and Landshut.  During the second quarter of the fifteenth century Straubing appears to have been dominant (Sch\u00e4dler, 1969, pp. 450-458), while in the second half of the century the production in Landshut reached its peak.  The above-mentioned terracotta figures in Landshut, the four figures in Vienna and in London, the head of St Peter in Munich, another figure of the Virgin, formerly in the Silten collection in Berlin (present location unknown; Wilm 1929, p. 69, fig. 119), and a Standing Virgin and Child in the Skulpturengalerie in Berlin (Demmler 1930, p. 118, no. 3117, h. 113.5cm) all seem to have come from the same workshop, which was probably actively producing devotional terracotta figures for a period of about twenty years. Although the exact numbers of such single figures or cycles produced during the period is unknown,  it is probable that only a small percentage has survived.",
