This turkey-work cover, however, has been cut down from a carpet, of earlier date than the chair. This was probably done in the 19th or early 20th century, to give the chair a suitably \u2018antique\u2019 appearance. The cover of the back now comes down to meet the seat, but originally the bottom of the back would have been just below the arms, leaving a large gap above the seat. \n\nThis chair comes from Beaudesert, Staffordshire, a house of 16th-century origins, but substantially rebuilt in the 19th century. The chair is probably part of the furnishings that were acquired after a fire in 1909, which virtually destroyed the interior of the house. The house was demolished in 1935.",
