His native landscape - Friesland in Germany, near the border with Denmark, was characterised by dramatic light effects and cloud formations. Nolde was associated with the radical Expressionist art group 'Die Brucke', but tempermentally he preferred to work in isolation, and was only formally allied to the group for a year around 1906-7.",

            "bibliography": "<u>100 Great Paintings in The Victoria & Albert Museum.</u> London: V&A, 1985, p.194\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"Emil Nolde 1867-1956\n<i>German School</i> \nFRIESLAND FARM UNDER RED CLOUDS \nSigned lower right <i>Nolde</i> \nWater-colour, 35.5 X 47.5 cm \nP.7-1964 \n\nWerner Haftmann, curator of the Nolde Museum in Seebull, writes tellingly of the roots of Nolde's art: 'It sprang directly from his native soil, that lonely, flat coast spread between sea and sky, up near the Danish border under whose tall sky, marked by flaming light effects and dramatic cloud formations, objects and people acquire a strange legendary quality. The setting itself strongly intensifies the visionary faculty of its inhabitants.'\n \nNolde was born Emil Hansen, adopting the name of his native village in 1901. As Haftmann points out 'It is as though he wanted, by taking this name, to mark his closeness to the earth.' He travelled widely: Denmark, France, Belgium, Holland, England, Italy; he taught in Switzerland from 1892-8; in 1913 the Imperial Colonial Office invited him to take part in an Expedition to the South Pacific. Yet he always returned to the Friesland landscape. From 1903-7 he spent many summers on the Baltic island of Alsen, with a studio on the beach, and from 1917-25 at Utenwarf, near Ruttebull, on the coast of Schleswig. When Utenwarf became Danish territory he moved back across the canal, to Germany, to Seebull, close to the village of Nolde. At about the time this water-colour was painted, in the summer of 1930, while the house at Seebull was being repaired, he stayed on the island of Sylt in the North Sea, where he wrote 'I stared at the wild restless beauty of the evenings, when the last hovering clouds pass their fiery fingers across the vault of the sky and the light dies in smouldering, shifting colours.' \n\nNorthern Europe was more colourful to him than the South Seas. Travel enhanced rather than changed perceptions conceived virtually in childhood. Of his native landscape he had written 'I looked at the sky and the great clouds, they were my friends' but his experience, for example, of Chinese wash drawing may account for the simplicity with which he conveyed such thoughts in water-colours like this. Nolde was formally allied to the radical Expressionists <i>Die Brucke</i> in 1906 but his intense individuality made it difficult for him to sustain communal activity and although his work had and retained a powerfully expressionist character, he withdrew his membership of the group in 1907. \n\nRosemary Miles\"\n<u>Victoria & Albert Museum Department of Prints and Drawings and Department of Paintings, Accessions 1964.</u> London: HMSO, 1965.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n\"<b>NOLDE, Emil (1867-1956)</b> \n\nFriesland farm under red clouds. c.1930 \n<i>Signed</i> Nolde. \n<i>Water-colour.</i>     P.7-1964 \n\n<i>Note:</i> The area depicted is North Friesland, the western coastal area of Schleswig-Holsten.
