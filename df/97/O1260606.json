A dish or bowl would be placed face down onto the spur during firing to prevent kiln debris settling on its surface. The three upward pointing corners of the spur would leave three small scars in the glaze where they stuck to the surface. Through repeated use, the three points became blunted and eventually the spur had to be replaced. \nThese spurs were found in their hundreds at the site of a former canal which backed onto the premises of some of the Delft potteries.",
