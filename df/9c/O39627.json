It is meant to be placed against a wall  - one side not being finished.\" Pope-Hennessy noted that parts of the sides are also left rough indicative that the basin was set into a wall. The arms on the front of the basin have been tentatively identified as those of the Codognola of Verona or Lion of Venice. Pope-Hennessy dates the basin to the second half of the sixteenth century.",
