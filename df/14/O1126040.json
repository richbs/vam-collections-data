Their work is sold through shops and galleries, or by mail order. They were named \u201cToymaker of the Year\u201d by the British Toymakers\u2019 Guild in 1984/5.\n\nAll these toys are of painted and varnished wood. The doll and from were voted joint \u201cToy of the Year\u201d by the British Toymakers\u2019 Guild in 1982.
