Webb\u2019s 1862 accounts list a chest with ironwork, possibly this one, as costing \u00a31 10s.\n\nThe chest\u2019s Gothic form and painted decoration show Webb\u2019s interest in medieval sources.  The regular painted pattern of formalised daisies recalls the backgrounds of miniatures in medieval manuscripts.  Even the way in which this pattern was applied, using sliver leaf, glazes and tinted varnishes, was an unusual medieval technique, also revived by another nineteenth-century furniture designer, William Burges.\n\nOn loan to National Trust Knightshayes Court.",

A review of the firm's furniture in <u>The Parthenon</u>, No. 23, October 4th 1862, p. 724, mentioned 'a lacquered chest', described as having 'diaper-flower decorations'. Philip Webb's accounts for the 1862 furniture designs included a chest with ironwork, at \u00a31 10s (\u00a31 50p).\n\nThe decoration on the painted panels was created using silver leaf, glazes and tinted varnishes, a medieval technique revived by Burges for the Yatman cabinet of 1858, and also found on the St. George cabinet. The source, Theophilus's <u>De diversis artibus</u>, an 11th century treatise, was published in English in 1847 by John Murray as <u>An Essay upon Various Arts</u>.",
