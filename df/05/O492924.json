Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. Above all they had to have the means of attaching the cord. In this example, there are a pair of holes (himotoshi) on the bottom of the sandal.  Although netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated is the katabori (shape carving). This is a three-dimensional carving, such as this netsuke of a kirin.\n\nKirin, as depicted within this netsuke, have a dragon's head, a deer's body, horse's hooves and a single horn on their foreheads. Primarily illustrated by the Kano school of painters kirin already had well established characteristics developed from Chinese Confucian classics. Kirin supposedly arrived on earth during the reign of a virtuous monarch and were an auspicious creature of good fortune. This crouching kirin has a sculptural quality due to its detailed tail, luxuriant coat, delicate undercutting and lively features.",
