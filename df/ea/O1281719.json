These are puzzling at first, but gradually the reader is able to impose some kind of meaning onto them. The images are juxtaposed so that each page echoes the last, either visually or symbolically.\n\nA clipping from an advert that reads 'Stretch and Dust' is followed by a picture of a cat stretched out on its back, which is followed by an aeroplane whose cross-like shape alludes to the crucified pose of the spread-eagled cat and so on.\n\nEach 'sequence' has been printed onto the back of a musical score (or 'sequence' of notes) which has been cut down to create the pages. The end section of the book is taken from an old geology text describing the characteristics of conglomerate, also know as  'pudding stone' - the dessert promised in the title.",
