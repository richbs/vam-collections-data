They were regarded at the time rather like costume jewellery.  A silver-hilted sword was the mark of a gentleman.\n\nMakers & Making\nIt seems clear from contemporary sources that hilt designs changed quite quickly, and old-fashioned silver hilts were usually traded in for their bullion value when a new hilt was acquired.  Hilt-making was a specialised trade employing comparatively few silversmiths, who rarely worked on any other silver wares.  The blade was made by a cutler and was usually imported.  The cutlers of Solingen in Germany supplied most  blades for dress swords in Britain in the 17th and 18th centuries.  Completed swords were sold by retailers, who also supplied customers with belts.  The retailer's name and address was generally placed on the reverse side of the top scabbard mount.  The name of the retailer who sold this particular sword was Hervett of Temple Bar, London.\n\nDesign\nMost English silver hilts from the Rococo period are very restrained, and the decoration consists of simple spiral fluting.  However, John Radburn, the hilt-maker who manufactured this one, developed a very ornate Rococo style, characterised by flutes overlaid with leaves and acorns in bold relief.",
