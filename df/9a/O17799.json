The Italian became the most famous and successful painter of London riverside scenes, and British artists soon followed his example.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nLondon began in ancient times as a small settlement next to a crossing point of the Thames, and until the mid-19th century the river was still the main route through which all the trading wealth flowed into the City. The docks were literally the gateway to the world, filled with a huge mass of shipping. London has changed so much since the 18th century that it is now difficult to identify the exact location shown in this picture.  There is some evidence that it represents the Old East India Wharf, as there is the mark 'UEIC' (United East India Company) on a bale. Therefore the traditional title of this painting may be correct. There were many such wharves on the Thames, with their wooden treadmill cranes for unloading the merchandise.\n\nPeople\nSamuel Scott was a marine painter and a drinking companion of William Hogarth (1697-1762). He was commissioned by merchants, sea captains and naval officers to paint pictures of riverside and sea scenes and naval engagements.",

There is now no reason to doubt that it is the work of Samuel Scott and another version of the subject, long attributed to Scott, hangs in the hall of the London Fishmongers' Company.  \n\nScott, like Monamy, began his career as a marine painter, not turning to the topographical scenes which earned him the nickname of 'the English Canaletto' until fairly late in his career, that is to say after the arrival of Canaletto in England in 1746 and that artist's speedy demonstration of the existence of a ready market for such subjects. \n\nThis work appears to date from the 1750s and vividly depicts how London's maritime trade was handled at the many riverside wharves and quays. The identification of the location of this scene has long been a problem which will probably remain insoluble. When bought the painting was entitled 'The Old East India Wharf at London Bridge', while the version at Fishmongers' Hall has been traditionally entitled 'Custom House Quay'. Another possible location which has been suggested is Bear Quay, which was next to London Bridge. All these seem to be unlikely, however, and it may well be that the scene is, in fact, a sort of <i>capriccio</i> or else should be located much further down river, possibly at Shadwell (where the East India Company had a warehouse), or at Deptford, or at Blackwall where the large East Indiamen customarily moored. The large bale in the right foreground is marked V.E.I.C. which does suggest the possibility of some connection with the East India Company. The ship moored at the left, however, is a two-decker man-of-war flying a commodore's flag. \n\nMuch interesting detail is included in the picture, most notably, perhaps, the tread-mill crane which is housed under the penthouse at the right. The figures of the men at work and in conversation about the quay have something of the liveliness and spontaneity found in the figure-painting of Luca Carlevaris, Canaletto's Venetian precursor in topographical painting. The spaniel seated in the foreground is thought to be possibly the work of Sawrey Gilpin (1733-1807), the animal painter, who became Scott's pupil in 1749. \n\nHarold Barkley\"",
