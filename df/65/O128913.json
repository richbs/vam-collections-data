This ivory, which is of exceptionally fine quality, shows an an individullity in composition which, though characteristic of this group, is rare in French 14th century ivories.\nIvory triptychs and diptychs made in this period were of a portable size, and were often   given as gifts; they became disseminated throughout the Christian world and helped to make the new French art international.",

The carver was known by this name because many of his reliefs are devoted to the story of the Death of the Virgin. He considers the atelier to have flourished ca. 1330, continuing beyond the first half of the century.  and influenced the \"rose\" series of diptychs.", 
            "historical_context_note": "Ivories such as this were carved by lay craftsmen and were largely intended for private devotion. The subjects of these devotional ivories were very limited, being almost entirely confined to the New Testament and its apocryphal additions. The most common narratives depicted are taken from the life of the Virgin or the Life and Passion of Christ. The popularity of these two subjects is evidenced in their endless repetition, which continued for over a century.\n\nNeither the story of the death of the Virgin nor that of  her subsequent coronation are related in the Bible. Both stories owe their existence to apocryphal literature some of which dates to the 4th century. The Golden Legend which appeared in the thirteenth century, at a time when popular devotion to the Virgin was especially intense, gives an extended account of the death of the Virgin based on earlier apocryphal works. Natanson proposes that the Master of the death of the Virgin based his depiction on the version of events  found in the Golden Legend.\nFrom uncertain begins in the fourth century, the cult of the Virgin gained momentum following the Council of Ephesus (431) and spread from the middle east via Constantinople (where she was the city's protectress) to become a central aspect of Christianity in western Europe by the twelfth century.  The popularity of the cult triggered an outburst of Marian visual imagery in manuscript illumination, monumental and miniature sculpture and metalwork. Once the Assumption and Corontaion of the Virgin had placed her firmly in the heavenly court, she was identified as a focus for prayer and as an intercessor for those who sought her protection for themselves and others.",
