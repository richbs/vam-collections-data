The broad base of the bottle is loosely based on the form of an Islamic or Chinese vase and the handle is derived from a Japanese precedent.\n\nDesign & Designing\nBesides imitating handles found on Japanese objects, the form of the handle is easily recognisable in the profile of traditional roofs and  temple gates in Japan. The engraved monogram on the lid, HS, also imitates a Japanese style.\n\nPeople\nChristopher Dresser is often regarded as the 'father of industrial design'.  He designed utilitarian objects for the general public while making full use of the latest techniques of mass production.  He trained at the Government School of Design and was significantly influenced by two of his tutors in particular, Richard Redgrave and Owen Jones.  He was receptive to a wide range of influences, but above all he drew inspiration from botanical sources and Japanese art, both of which he studied intensively.",
