It took the form of a wall covering and was used by the Design Research Unit in the Dome of Discovery at the Festival of Britain in 1951.  The Dome was part of the complex on the South Bank in London, which was one of the venues used for the Festival.  The Design Research Unit was set up in 1943 by designers Milner Gray and Sir Mischa Black who believed that lasting design came from thorough research by a multi-skilled team.  Plankton reflected a new trend for patterns inspired by scientific structures, which was seen in many textile designs displayed at the Festival.",
