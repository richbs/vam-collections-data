The fifth shows a winged sphinx and prey, a winged quadruped with fish and a griffin with a serpents' tail. The sixth tier contains two cockerels, a duck and a swan. And the top register shows a sword-wielding half-man with serpent's tail, another duck and a flying bird. The shaft is hollowed out from the bottom to a depth of 7.9 cm.

This object is in cylindrical shape with a variety of beasts, roughly grouped by type. The staff is divided into 7 registers with 3 squares to each tier. The tiers are grouped in pairs and divided by beaded strips.\nThis cylindrical section has been associated with three other pieces of comparable scale and design (Metropolitan, NY / British Museum / Louvre) and the shaft of a tau-cross in Florence. The four sections cannot have belonged to the same object, although similar in size and design. They very likely come from different objects, like a crozier or tau-cross.",
