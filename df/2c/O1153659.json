            "historical_context_note": "In imperial China the most prized material for chairs was the huali wood. Bamboo, although it was cheaper due to abundant availability, was not necessarily an inferior alternative to huali wood. The bamboo had for centuries been considered a 'noble' plant because it stands upright, making it particularly popular amongst the literati.    \nTo the European consumers a bamboo chair probably represented something from the mysterious East. In terms of design the openwork panels on this chair are rather fanciful and do not accord with traditional Chinese taste, suggesting that the object was intended for the export market.\n\nSoft upholstery such as that found on European chairs was unknown in China before 1800. There were only two types of chair seats in imperial China: a hard seat and a soft cane seat. A hard seat is usually made of wood, with or without a woven cane matting on top (for one with cane matting on top see FE.66-1983). \n\nA soft seat is made of woven caning, with split bamboo and rattan being the most commonly used materials. On wooden chairs the cane is woven through holes drilled on the four sides of the seat frame. As the soft cane seat has to take the weight of the chair-user it is usally reinforced with a palm-fibre rope underwebbing, also woven through the same holes. A chair with a soft cane seat would be more comfortable to sit on, but is not as durable as one with a hard seat. \n\nThe wrap-around method of construction is a distinctive characteristic feature of Chinese bamboo furniture. Because the bamboo stem is hollow it is possible to cut away part of the fibre where required, leaving the rind to continue as one long unbroken strip thus eliminating the need for jointing. Apart from its cheapness as a material the other advantage of the bamboo is its light weight and cool surface.\n\nCaning started in China at least a thousand years before chairs were invented, when the Chinese people sat on mats on the floor. On chairs the hard seat was the norm except on folding chairs, whose seats are inevitably made of pliable materials. Wooden chairs with soft cane seats were popular in the 16th and 17th centuries. For bamboo chairs, if the base of its seat is made of wooden slats as is the case here, the cane matting on top would be visually more attractive whilst the slats would take the weight of the chair-user. Bamboo and rattan are both grown in the southern provinces so it is reasonable to deduce that cane mattings were mostly made in southern China. There is little information available about how labour was organized.",
