Published in The Graphic in 1885, Bootles' Baby was produced at London's Globe Theatre in May 1888 as a play by Hugh Moss and revived at the Garrick Theatre in February 1900, after which it was taken on tour by Alfred J. Byde's Company. This poster advertises that production at the Royal Duchess Theatre, Balham, for the week commencing Monday 11th June 1900.\n\nThe novel was first published in 1890 by Frederick Warne as Bootles' Baby. A Story of the Scarlet Lancers. It concerned a bachelor officer of the Scarlet Lancers, Captain Algernon Ferrers, nicknamed Bootles, who brings up the baby girl Mary, or Mignon, left in his rooms at Idlemaster Barracks.",
