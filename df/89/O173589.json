Hon. Viscount Harcourt, K. C. M. G., O. B. E. \"The identification of this miniature is not certain as there is no inscription on the reverse, but it does compare very favourably with the portrait of Robert Sidney in the NPG, ca. 1588. Judging from the treatment of the hair which is free and expressive, the miniature dates from before the time that he adopted Oliver's style in 1593. It is possible that it dates from the period when the sitter was Governor of Flushing. Robert Dudley, (1563-1626), second son of Sir Henry Sidney and Mary Dudley. M.P. for Glamorganshire. Went to the Netherlands as Governor of Flushing and Commander of a trop of horses; wounded at the siege of Steenwyck, of 1592; distinguished at battle of Turnhout, 1598; chief channel of communication between the court and Essex during the disturbances to Essex's rebellion of 1601; created Baron Sidney by James I, 1603; Viscount Lisle, 1605 and Earl of Leicester 1618. Married Barbara Gamage (d. 1621).\"",
