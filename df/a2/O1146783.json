Harry Hammond remembers, \"I first met him at a club in Soho called the Whisky a Go Go.  It was set up by his agent for a few of us from the press.  I thought he was a nice guy and he'd written nice melodies.  That was the only time Holly was in England and he was only here for two or three months.  He did one show at the Gaumont State Cinema in Kilburn, which is where I took the pictures for the New Musical Express.  In the 50's, I was often the only photographer at a concert.  The reaction was quite mild and quiet - just a polite clap.  We've all learnt to appreciate Buddy Holly in retrospect but he didn't carve out any particular moment at that time. It was just another rock and roll group to us\".",
