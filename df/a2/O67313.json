It is just one of the enormous range of designs employed by potters at the Iznik kilns in north-west Anatolia. \n\nThe imperial Ottoman court renewed its patronage of Iznik ceramics during the construction of the S\u00fcleymaniye mosque in Istanbul in the period 1550 to 1557. The first Iznik tiles were produced, and potters added a bright red to the range of colours painted under the glaze. This was achieved with a slip made from a special clay.\n\nIn the following decades, Iznik tiles of high quality were decorated in red, green and tones of blue on a white ground. Dishes, bottles and other vessels had similar decoration on white or coloured grounds. \n\nIn the most celebrated Iznik wares, the sage green was replaced by a bright emerald colour, and the mauves and purples by red slip. Black was mostly used for outlines.",
