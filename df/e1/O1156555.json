His clothing line is now represented in 26 countries worldwide. In 2007 he launched his menswear and kidswear range. Also in this year he was honoured with the CDFA Swarovski Award for emerging talent in womenswear. His signature is making 'beautiful clothes with added touches of madness, striving towards the imperfection. The result is a creation of individual looks that are unexpected, unplanned, but completely relevant'. This particular dress is a miniature of the womenswear version and is a gift from his company to the museum.",
