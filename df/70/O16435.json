It shows the Ancient poetess Sappho on the top of a cliff lamenting over the desertion of her lover, Phaon. The lyre, slung over her shoulder, is the traditionnal attribute of poets. As a precurser to Symbolism, Moreau sought inspiration from mythological, literary, and biblical references.",

From its subject matter the water-colour must be the first of the three episodes depicting the death of the Greek poetess ; the other two are entitled 'Sappho flinging herself into the Sea' (in a private collection in Paris) and 'Sappho lying at the foot of the Cliff' (formerly in the Esnault-Pelterie Collection; the smaller version now in the museum at Saint-Lo). \n\nMoreau exhibited a series of mythological subjects, including 'Oedipus and the Sphinx', 'Jason' and 'Orpheus' at the Paris Salons of 1864-6, but the style and complex technique of this water-colour, with its rich, jewel-like colours is characteristic of his later work. \n\nA pencil drawing in the Museum's collection is inscribed <i>1 ere Danseuse Mlle Subra Opera de Sapho</i>, and though Moreau is not known to have designed for Gounod's opera of that title, it would seem that the subject was inspired by a visit to a revival of Gounod's work in 1884, and that all three paintings may be dated from about this year. \n\nCertainly there is something rather 'stagey' about the composition, with the heroine seated in the centre in a semirecumbent position in which an aria could be sung with comfort, a backcloth sky, and the pillar and part of the cliff as drop scenes. The same could be said for 'Sappho flinging herself into the Sea', for she falls in a graceful upright pose, holding up her lyre, as though supported on wires, instead of dropping headlong and sprawling into the sea. \n\nMoreau's paintings were admired by Marcel Proust and by the Symbolists of the 1880s and 1890s, a group who reacted against the fin-de-si\u00e8cle realism in art and helped to release it from a slavery to appearances. A key work of the Symbolists was J K Huysmans' novel <i>A Rebours</i>, which contains an enthusiastic description of Moreau's exhibits in the Salon of 1876. \n\nJean Hamilton\"\nMargot Th.
