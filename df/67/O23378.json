The garment is of the normal kimono construction but without the addition of extra material at each side of the front opening. The straight neckband extends to the hem and there is a short overcollar of cream silk. As with many children's kimono the corners of the sleeves have been folded up and sewn onto themselves at an angle of 45\u00b0. A narrow red silk belt is attached at the back of the garment at waist tlevel, another feature of Japanese children's clothing. There is a mid-blue lining which stops short of the hem and does not line the sleeves.\nThe all-over design consists of bold, scattered green and yellow triangles against a blue-black ground. The motifs were achieved by a combination of stitching and binding before dying.",
