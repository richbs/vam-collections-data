The obverse of this medal represents Francis I, the King of France, wearing laurel wreath, in field left a sceptre with lily finial. The reverse shows a mounted warrior to right, striking at the fallen figure of Fortune. Both obverse and reverse have the pearled borders. The Cellini medal was used by Titian as the portrait source for the painting commissioned by Aretino and given to the King in 1539. \n\nBenvenuto Cellini (1500-1571) was trained as a goldsmith in Florence. He developed great skill and originality in his techniques. He lived a dramatic but vibrant life which is documented in his autobiography (unfinished, but published in 1728). This book was translated by many writers, one of them Goethe and was the basis for Berlioz' opera 'Benvenuto Cellini' (1837). As a sculptor he has a Mannerist style, which is elaborate, elegant and precious. He stands for the tragic yet roamantic artist.",
