His work may be described as Symbolist and has much in common with that of figures such as Odilon Redon and Gustave Dor\u00e9, although Hieronymus Bosch, Giovanni Battista Piranesi and Francisco de Goya have also been cited as possible influences. \n\nBrandel\u2019s imagery often includes architecture fantastically interpreted, with exaggerated and highly improbable structures, scale and perspective. Elsewhere he creates similarly disturbing landscapes. These fantasies are frequently inhabited by men, women and animals engaged in strange or ritualistic behaviour. The figures increase the sense of vast dimension and are often endowed with supernatural powers such as the ability to float or fly. Here four figures support a bier holding a bearded, naked corpse high up in the vaulted space of a cathedral.",
