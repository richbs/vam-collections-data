The sofa here represents an important collaboration between a talented young designer and a manufacturer determined to promote new design. This collaboration marked a new era in the status and importance of British furniture design. \n\nThe shape of the sofa was unusual in mainstream British upholstered furniture at this time. So too was the way it was raised above the ground on aluminium feet. However, its construction was traditional. The frame is made of beechwood, and the upholstery consists of a conventional coiled spring structure, supported by hessian webbing and covered with foam. This construction was considered unusual on the Continent, where manufacturers used elasticised webbing or injection-moulded foam in place of springs.",
