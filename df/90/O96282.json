            "public_access_description": "Plaquettes are small, often one-sided, reliefs. They may be made of bronze (as here), brass, lead or precious materials. They originated in the 1440s, often from a desire to reproduce or imitate images known from coins and hardstone engravings from ancient Greece and Rome, and sometimes as reproductions of contemporary engraved gems. This is one of around 13 examples of the same scene which are known to exist, including two hardstone cameos, and plaquettes in lead and bronze.  \n\nThe scene, The Choice of Hercules, is taken from classical mythology. The seated figure of Hercules chooses between Virtue and Vice, here personified by the two goddesses Minerva (with a helmet) and Venus. \n\nSome plaquettes were made as collectors\u2019 pieces, to be viewed and displayed in private. Others were created for practical or devotional purposes, such as decorations for caskets, ink-stands and paxes. \n\nThe style is that of the gem-engraver Valerio Belli (around 1468-1546), who worked for two successive popes.  Almost all of his bronze plaquettes are cast from his engravings in rock crystal or hardstone. In this case, however, no rock crystal original has yet been identified. The bronzes would have been cast from a plaster or brass mould made from the original hardstone engraving.",

For other examples of the plaquette see Burns et al, 2000.  There is also a version in the British Museum which is signed by Valerio Belli.  The iconography relates to the story of Hercules at the cross-roads, or the choice of Hercules.  Related hardstone versions exist in Berlin and Naples.  The seated figure of Hercules is a reference to one of Michelangelo's slaves in the Sistine chapel.",
