For a sturdy stem, the traditional mould-blown baluster was almost invariably used (which makes it very difficult to precisely date surviving examples). Salvers were produced in several standard sizes, which made pyramids or individual replacement salvers easy to order from any glass retailer.\n\nOwnership & Use\nThe exact date of the appearance of jelly pyramids by combining several salvers is difficult to pinpoint, though it certainly took place in the first half of the 18th century. Glass salvers had themselves been in use from at least the 1680s. By the end of the 18th century, pyramids had become a common sight in confectioners' shops, which probably contributed to their gradual fall from fashion in the first half of the 19th century. By this date, turned-out jellies from large creamware or stoneware jelly moulds had become popular.",
