He implies that these were all the accomplishments thought necessary for a 'career' of marriage and motherhood. Indeed one girl, the finished product of such schooling, is seen through the window in the act of eloping with her suitor (though as we know from the case of the impetuous Lydia in Jane Austen's 'Pride and Prejudice', elopement did not necessarily result in marriage).  The picture only slightly exaggerates the barbarous physical constrictions and distortions imposed on girls and women in the name of fashion and femininity. The tendency to fainting, general weakness and frailty so marked in girls in the 19th century was largely the result of constrictive clothing. There are documented cases of girls dying, or at least disabled, by having their internal organs crushed by too-tight corsets.",

Such an education is shown to be both superficial and self-indulgent. The artist implies that these were the only accomplishments thought necessary for a \u2018career\u2019 of marriage and motherhood. Indeed, one girl is seen in the act of eloping with her suitor through the window. She is the finished product of this kind of schooling.",
