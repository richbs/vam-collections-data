It depicts a purpose-built locker room set in a studio.  Part of a series entitled Making Your Dreams Come True  the work results from a commission awarded by BMW Financial Services Group.  Of the work, Smith states, 'I have chosen to photograph sets from the world of glamour photography, as play-acting seems such an integral part of dreaming.
