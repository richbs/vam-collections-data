These children were better looked after, and had a higher survival rate, than the foundling children also 'out at nurse', but the lack of relationship is demonstrated both by the child's turning to its nurse in preference to its mother, and by the mother's neutral stance and body language.  Its pair 'Nurs'd at Home' (B.248-1998) contrasts the closer relationship possible between mother and child when both shared the parental home.",
