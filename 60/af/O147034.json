Separate wooden frames were used in Italy  from about the 15th century, though they developed from earlier frames in  both metal and wood on altarpieces. Earlier wooden frames could be formed from the moulded edge of the panel on which the image was painted, and this  type is now known as an engaged frame.\n\nAs well as many picture frames acquired with paintings, the V&A acquired some  frames - principally Italian renaissance in origin or style - as independent  objects. They were usually chosen for the fine quality of their carving and  decorative effects, and many are gilded using various techniques. Many of the  ornaments used are classical and architectural in origin.",
