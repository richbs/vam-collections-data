Mathmos frequently commissions designs from progressive young designers, and develops innovative technologies for its products.\n\nThe Bubble light, designed in 2001 by Aaron Rincover and manufactured and retailed by Mathmos, uses LEDs within a sealed silicone ball to form a rechargeable and fully portable light that can be used both indoors and outdoors. The tactile sphere responds to the squeeze of a hand and is symptomatic of a recent design trend towards playful objects that respond to their immediate environment. \n\nAvailable in a variety of colours, (this example is orange when illuminated), the Bubble light has been widely exhibited and has received a number of awards including the Decorative Light Award from the UK\u2019s Light Magazine in 2001.",
