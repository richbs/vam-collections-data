Her head is turned away from the book towards the angel. She wears a long gown and her mantle has slipped from her shoulders and covers her feet in deep anguar folds. The kneeling angel holds a staff and scroll in his left hand, while his right is raised in blessing. He is dressed in a gown under an ample cope, which falls in angular folds over his feet, comparable with the drapery of the mantle of the Virgin. The other side of this panel represents The Agony in the Garden with Christ kneeling on a rocky ground, his hands clasped together in player; a chalice with a small cross in the bowl appears at the top of the rock. Three sleeping Apostles recline in the left foreground; St. Peter lies in the front. The background shows a river in a hilly landscape and trees; a group of approaching soldiers with torches is seen in the middle distance.",

The type of wood points to an origin in the Alpine region, and the vendor's statement that it came from a church in Innsbruck seems to be consistent with the stylistic features of sculptures and paintings produced there in around 1500. The facial types and the scheme of the drapery in this panel are closely related to several reliefs in Innsbruck ascribed to an unknown sculptor who cooperated with the workshop of Martin Enzelsberger. The painting on the reverse of the Agony in the Garden is closest in style to the paintings ascribed to Enzelsberger. The painting lacks the quality of Enzelsberger's autograph works, however, and it is likely to be a product of his workshop.",
