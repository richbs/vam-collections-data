The horse is in a leaping stance with the front legs tucked up. The whole is mounted on a metal mechanism and two large black wheels with a third black and white wheel at the front for balance. \n*It is marked on the left rump with S Y in a diamond and MADE IN JAPAN underneath. It is the same model as B143-1994 with a different trademark and it is probable that the toy was made by Yoneya Toys Co.",
