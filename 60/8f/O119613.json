Several factories in Staffordshire specialised in moulded earthenware portrait figurines which were decorated by hand and sold cheaply. This figurine was produced as a souvenir of John Liston (1776-1846), as Sam Swipes, the comic figure he played in Theodore Hook's play Exchange No Robbery at the Haymarket Theatre in 1820.  The figurine was based on a contemporary lithograph published by J.W. Gear.\n\nDespite a rather serious temperament, John Liston became one of the greatest comedians of all time, achieving his greatest successes in farce, and particularly as Paul Pry, a role in which he was often depicted in paintings, drawings and figurines. Liston was the first comic actor to command a salary greater than a tragedian, earning the vast salary of sixty to a hundred pounds a week with Madam Vestris's company at the Olympic Theatre.  He retired in 1837 after a successful stage career which lasted over thirty years.",
