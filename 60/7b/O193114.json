He worked in a variety of media but has become widely recognised through his later printed work, based  on the exploration of  colour. \n\nThroughout the 1940s and '50s Albers'  black and white prints explored the perception of space through line. In 1949  he wrote a definitive text on colour theory but it was not until the 1960s that  he began work on a series of coloured squares and rectangles, which explored the idea of colour as an illusion, depending on context. \"We do not  see colours as they really are\" he wrote \"in our perception they alter one another\"  his experiments in this field depended on the medium of screen-print because its reliably consistent evenness of colour could be produced very easily and with great speed.",
