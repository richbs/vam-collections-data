To the side is a coil of metal which quickly resets the plunger so it may be pushed again.  The plunger and mechanism are rd and opaqur plastic and the platform is green plastic.  In the platform are four cut out panels and in the centre is cream plastic figure of a dancer.  Into the cut out panels slot four flame shaped metal pieces, each with cream and red stripes on the inside and coloured illustrations on the outside.  These form an egg shape covering the figure.  As the toy spins, these pieces open out to show the figure.\n\n*The figure does not spin and has been cast with two fronts rather than a front and back and it has two points each side representing the bust.",
