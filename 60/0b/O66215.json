This statue is executed in Rome where Cardwell lived for some years, although he exhibited at the Royal Academy in London, and many of his patrons were British. This statue represents Cupid and Pan. This group is based on the theme of Love the Conqueror, in which Cupid is shown overcoming Pan, who is crouched on one knee, by holding one of his horns. \nSince Pan represents carnal lust, this theme was seen as the combat of divine over earthly love, Cupid in this case having the more virtuous role. As Pan also personifies universal nature, this relief thus equally illustrates the all-embracing power of love.\n\nHolme Cardwell (1820-1864) attended the Royal Academy Schools in 1834, and in 1841 travelled to Paris where he studied under David d'Angers (1788-1856). Cardwell later settled in Rome. He exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1837 and 1856, at the British Institution in 1840, and twice at the Suffolk Street Galleries.",
