He was inspired by the architecture and artefacts seen there and absorbed their abstract, formal qualities into his prints made during the 1940s. After experimenting with modulated line, in a series of drypoints, Albers went on to make a series of lithographs collectively titled 'Graphic Tectonic' with very precise linear structures but, which through repeated and closely drawn parallel lines, and the use of right-angles, create powerfully ambiguous visual illusions of space and volume. \n\nMonte Alban, an ancient hill-top city  in the Oaxaca region of Mexico, is now an archeological site with a maze of underground passage ways, rooms, drainage and water storage systems",
