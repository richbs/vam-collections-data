The middle of the top is a darker colour that the two wings, especially on the underside, but nevertheless are original and sections exhibit consistent saw marks. \n\nRight hand wing (nearest museum number)\nLeft hand wing (with apparent saw marks)\nBack left hand hinge has been replaced but with a hing of the same butterfly shape. Front right hand hinge has been replaced by a modern square leafed hinge. Both wings have battons although marks on the underside suggest that the gates did come out further at some point.. The moulding and recess of the wings and top are semicircular with a step on either side. The newer leg is tenoned and pegged at the cross support, the older is is double pegged and both are through tenons. The engagement is 1/2 round rather than 1/4 round moulding.",
