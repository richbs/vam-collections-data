During World War II she performed with ENSA, playing xylophone and saxophone to the troops in England, and after D-day in Germany . She adopted the stage name Sandra Wells after the war, and as such became one of the very few successful female ventriloquists, developing an original act with her vent doll Horace Higgins, and her glove puppets Ernie and Elsie.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s she specialised in pantomime, as a pantomime cat, appearing amongst others with Richard Hearne ('Mr. Pastry'), Bud Flanagan and Tommy Trinder.",
