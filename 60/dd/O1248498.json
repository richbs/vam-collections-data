Together with his wife, Lucienne Day, he actively introduced and promoted modernist design in Britain in the second half of the 20th century. Typically for this optimistic period, they intended a broad reach rather than a luxury market and worked with manufacturer's like <i>Hille Internationa</i><i>l</i> and department store <i>Heals</i>. \n\nThe <i>Polyprop chair</i> is Day's most successful chair.  It became standard institutional and school seating in the UK and millions were sold internationally. It represents Day's commitment to mass-produced, low-cost furniture but also his curiosity and determination to engage with new materials and technology. Robin Day was one of the first designers to acknowledge the potential of polypropylene, a light, strong, heat-resistant and hard-wearing, suitable for a mass market. \nSince the 1950s, Robin Day had worked with British manufacturer <i>Hille International </i>which intended to overcome their period furniture reputation by collaborating with a young designer. Day designed a number of simple but elegant chairs, tables, desks and storage units, often using new wood- or metal working techniques. Working with polypropylene posed a challenge for the manufacturer. After the success of the so-called <i>Polyprop Chair</i> in 1963, went on to create a whole \u2018polyprop\u2019 family - the 1967 <i>Polypropylene Armchair</i>, the 1971 <i>Series E school chairs</i> and the 1975 jaunty indoor/outdoor <i>Polo chair</i>. The dark blue version of the <i>Polyprop Armchair</i> was introduced in 1968.",
