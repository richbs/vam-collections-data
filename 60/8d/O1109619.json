Full citation: \n\n\"<b>A Man, probably intended to represent John Milton</b>\n(b. 1608 d.1674)\n<b>1675-1700 </b>\n607-1882\n\n<b>Oval 75 x 60 mm\n</b>\nFeatures in dark grey stipple with touches of blue in the eyes and traces of faded sanguine, on a pale carnation ground; hair in pale brown wash, lined and hatched in darker colour and with the lights in pale brown gouache; collar modelled with grey stipple over the bare vellum, with some thick white; robe in black wash with the lights, buttons, etc. in pale grey; background a solid ultramarine wash; on vellum put down on a leaf from a table-book. \n\n<b>Condition:</b> Good, except the background to the right totally overpainted in a copperblue, now discoloured and paler than the original ultramarine which survives to the left. \n\n<b>Signed:</b> Falsely Signed in gold, upper left: <i>S.C.</i>\n\n<b>Frame:</b> Rectangular fruitwood veneer stained black over oak, the joints mitred at the front, halved at the back; fitted, perhaps later, with an oval slip and the aperture further reduced with a gilt rim to fit the miniature; card backing and a simple brass ring and fastener nailed to the oak carcase. \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> Acquired by John Jones from an unrecorded source, and by him bequeathed to the Museum, 1882. \n\n<b>Literature:</b> Williamson 1904, vol. I, pp. 72, 74 (as <i>John Milton</i> by Cooper); <i>Catalogue of Miniatures</i>, 1908, p. 9 (as after Cooper 'on bone'); Foster 1914-16, vol. I, p. 165 (imprecisely identified); Long 1923, p. 75, no. 599 (as alleged portrait of Milton, perhaps after Cooper, on vellum on gessoed card); Long 1930, p. 84 (as 'an 18th-century fake'); <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 66 (Anon., pseudo 17th century). \n\nBelieved by Jones to be a portrait of Milton by Cooper, painted on bone, the miniature was relegated to 'after Cooper' in the 1908 catalogue, and the same year examined closely by Long, who dismissed the idea that it was painted on bone. The notion that miniatures were sometimes painted on bone was current among the dealers and connoisseurs of the late nineteenth century and was particularly promoted by Dr G C Williamson, who would refer to it confidently as 'mutton bone'. (1) Long, as well as correcting this mistake, commented acidly in a note on the file: 'This wretched miniature is an 18th-century fake.' \n\nThe miniature is clearly a fake in the sense that it bears a false Cooper signature and is not a work of the 1650s or 1660s, but Long was perhaps too hard on it. The use of a table-book leaf as the secondary support, and the orthodox carnation ground under the face-painting, suggest a seventeenth- (or at latest early eighteenth-) century origin; the stipple technique too is perfectly right for the period, being practised in particular by Peter Cross from the 1660s until c.1720. The use of a solid blue background, particularly painted in ultramarine, though not right for a portrait of this size and type in the 1650s or 1660s, might well have been intended by a late seventeenth-century copyist or pasticheur to evoke a vague sense of the past. \n\nTo what end? The identification as Milton is now clearly incredible, and pace [ones, was already incredible by the late nineteenth century. As David Piper has pointed out, however, the Milton iconography was already laden with false images by the end of the seventeenth century, and scholarly attempts to undo the muddle were underway by the 1730s. (2) We know, however, that Cross worked on the Cooper portrait of Cromwell and that he copied the portrait of Mary Queen of Scots which was at that time thought to be the key image of her. (3) Although not by Cross, this miniature may well be a product of that nascent 'antiquarian' culture of the late seventeenth century, in which it seemed necessary to record the testimony and the authentic appearance of those who had taken part in the epochal events of the mid-century before it was too late. Hence Vertue's anxiety in the 1720s to establish and publish Milton's authentic image as a young man (the so-called Onslow portrait): (4) and hence too, perhaps, an attempt such as this to visualise Milton in the years of his Latin Secretaryship to the Commonwealth, no longer the exquisite young scholar, but plumper and older, though still with strikingly fine hair: an attempt also, perhaps, if the' Signature' is not a later addition, to visualise what Cooper might have made of the poet if he had had the chance. The resulting miniature is of course a fiction and does not closely resemble the actual image of Milton in middle age, i.e., the bust attributed to Edward Pierce in Christ's College, Cambridge; (5) but it is not uninteresting. \n\n1 See for example Williamson 1904. vol.
