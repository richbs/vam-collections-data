Valpy and his wife in a late 17th-century house in the Cathedral close at Winchester. The drawing room is an early example of the taste for 'decorating with antiques' which is still current today. Real and reproduction Georgian furniture is mixed with 'Art Furniture'  (including an Indian table in a North African/Islamic style of the type sold at Liberty's. A similar table is displayed in the British Galleries - museum no. E.222-1955) and easy chairs (probably mid-Victorian) disguised under chintz covers, all set on a splendid rug. Also a reflection of the same taste for the 18th century is the large collection of ceramics, on open display and in neo-rococo cabinets.\n\nPeople\nVery little is known about the artist, except that she lived in Winchester when these watercolours were painted and normally specialised in architectural subjects.",
