Thin gold lines remain to  form a network of long C-scrolls.  Inside the case are two miniatures from the workshop of Nicholas Hilliard. One shows James I, King of England (ruled 1603-1625),  the other Noah's Ark.  The portrait of James I derives from a miniature by Hilliard, painted around 1605, which is now at Windsor Castle.\n\nPeople\nNicholas Hilliard  (possibly born in 1547, died 1619)  was the most famous miniature painter of his day. He was trained as a goldsmith.   He is known to have worked on a jewel for Edward Seymour, 2nd Earl of Hertford (died 1621) and to have designed a Great Seal for Elizabeth I (ruled 1558-1603). Unfortunately, however,  there is no documentary evidence that he did any of the gold work on jewels associated with miniatures from his workshop, even when they were as ambitious as the Drake Jewel.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe emblem inside the lid alludes to the English monarch guiding the ship of the English Church safely through the stormy sea. It  was originally associated with Queen Elizabeth's leadership of the Church during the decades following Henry VIII's break with Rome in the 1530s.  James I adopted the emblem on this locket, and also on some medals.",
