The casket, of lathe-turned steatite, has a globular body on a circular disc foot surmounted by a four-tiered knob, perhaps intended to suggest a four-tiered honorific umbrella (chattra). It was found to contain one piece of calcined bone. Incised on the upper part of the casket, in early Brahmi characters, is the following Pali inscription: 'Sapurisasa Majhimasa Kodiniputasa', ie, [the relics] of the Emancipated Majhimasa. It may be presumed that the bone fragment found therein belonged to this much revered teacher. Another portion of his calcined bone is recorded by inscription to have been interned in a relic casket at Stupa No 2 at Sanchi. He is known to have travelled as a missionary to the central Himalayan region with four other monks after the third Buddhist Council held at Pataliputra (Patna) in the 18th year of the reign of the Emperor Asoka (273-232 BCE). The date of his death is not recorded.\n\nThis and other relic finds of the period demonstrate that the interning of relics in containers and placing them in stupas was a widespread practice in the late Mauryan period. These were not confined to \u201coriginal\u201d Buddha relics but also included the corporal remains of revered followers of the Buddha.",
