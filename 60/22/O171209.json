Like Catholic women elsewhere in southern Europe they often wore elaborate crosses as jewellery.  \n\nRed was the most popular colour in traditional jewellery throughout Italy.  In the south the jewellers usually used coral, but in the northern and central regions they decorated their crosses with garnets, as here. This cross, which comes from Samnium, has engraved decoration on the back, which is unusual for this type of jewellery.\n\nIt was bought as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
