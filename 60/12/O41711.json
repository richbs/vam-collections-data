A pair of army boots are on the beach beside the man. There is a sailing boat on the sea in the background, and an aeroplane in the sky. The words 'Extraordinary, touching, very funny and true' are in a banner in the sky, as if flown from the aeroplane, and the words 'with Tim Barlow' are by arrows pointing to the boy and the man.  Advertising Theatre de Complicite's touring production of  My Army Part One. White lettering above the image gives the name of the company, with the title 'My Army' in red over the image and 'Part Two' as if stamped on, in a circle.

Part Two dealt with the absurdities of basic army training giving way to a reality that is even more ridiculous of life in the army in the jungle and with a transfer to Germany.  Complicite overprinted these posters according to the venue.  My Army was originally devised for the Almeida Theatre season, December 1988.",
