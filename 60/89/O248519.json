It was inspired by doublesided Roman coins, which usually had a portrait of the emperor on one side and Latin inscriptions on both sides. Renaissance medals had a portrait on the obverse (front) and often a motto or allegorical figure on the reverse, underlining the qualities of the person shown in the portrait.\n\nOn this example, the obverse shows Domenico\u2019s profile, while the reverse shows him kneeling and holding the feet of a crucifix. The artist Pisanello used the commissioned medal as an opportunity to show his skill at foreshortening, as seen in the rear view of the horse.",

In his last works, he isolated these motifs within the circular space of the medals to make images that were emblematic rather than pictorial. \n\nOn the reverse of this portrait he shows the Lord of Cesena as a Christian knight - vowing on the battlefield to build a hospital dedicated to the Holy Crucifix. The Crucifix on the medal is extracted from the 'Vision of Saint Eustace' a scene painted by Pisanello in about 1438-1442 (now in the National Gallery) in which the cross appears between the antlers of a stag.",
