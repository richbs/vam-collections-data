This medal has only the obverse of this medal represents bust of Kunz Peck facing front, embracing his son Sebald(left), and sons Hans and Linhard(right). All are bare-headed and bearded. This medal is highly idiosyncratic in composition and style. Habich tentatively assigned it to Hans Peisser, nothing paralles between its oval shape and wreathed border and those of one of Peisser's works. It has also been suggested that the medal might be Netherlandish. Kunz Peck, a sculptor and joiner, was a citizen of Nuremberg, however, and Habich comments that the work could well have been produced by Peck himself. The warmth of the image, together with the unusual oval form, suggest that it may well be a self-portrait of the artist with his sons. Sebald Peck was also a noted sculptor and architect, and it is also possible that it was he who created this medal. His brothers Hans Peter and Linhard were both joiners. It is worth comparing this medal with the 1519 medal of the five Pfinzing brothers by Hans Schwarz. Their Jugate busts are ranged in profile, while here the family grouping is more integrated. The motto on the cartouche is of the type normally found on reverses of medals, and is a further exceptional aspect of this medal.",
