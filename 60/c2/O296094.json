            "public_access_description": "Silver buttons were an important element of traditional dress throughout Europe in the 19th century.  Most had a loop on the back for attachment, but in Norway and Sweden stud buttons were also used.  These were mainly worn by men, at the throat, to keep their shirts closed.  They were often decorated with filigree.  \n\nThe pattern on this stud button, of rings of coil rings and bands of wrapped wire surrounding a central knop, is very common on buttons from the late 18th century onwards.  It was used in Norway and northern Germany as well as Sweden.  In the 19th century the studs grew larger, and the silversmiths started to add red and green glass pastes to the decoration.  This shirt stud is typical of the kind worn in the first half of the 19th century in Sweden.  It has the maker\u2019s mark AN.  Andreas Norstrand of Lund, and Abraham Norlin of Malm\u00f6, both used this mark, and both specialised in making the traditional jewellery of Sk\u00e5ne in the first half of the 19th century.  Sk\u00e5ne province has the richest tradition of jewellery, and more was worn there than in any other district.  Almost all the Swedish traditional jewellery at the V&A comes from Sk\u00e5ne.",
