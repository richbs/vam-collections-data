The top is inlaid with a selection of  small objects as if  someone has turned out his pockets for a memory game. These include scissors, a watch, a pair of tortoishell glasses and a box of matches. \n\nThe designer was the Japanese artist Foujita who trained in Japan but worked in Paris from 1913, and whose work combined both eastern and western traditions. The table shows a Chinese influence in its overall shape, but the playful decoration of household objects is thoroughly European.",
