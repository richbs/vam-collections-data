It was used successfully in mesh necklaces and bracelets, gold chain and wire work, also as a foil to gemstones. \n\nThe technique of filigree with spirals and granules (cannetille and grainti) was revived in France then copied in England. Jewellers liked the economical use of gold and women appreciated the intricacy of the style. \n\nColoured golds were also popular. In gold alloy more copper gives a redder gold, while extra zinc or zinc and silver will result in a pale yellow gold",
