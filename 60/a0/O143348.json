As the name implies, their work was non-figurative and colour, line and texture were important as ends in themselves rather than being deployed for any traditional style of still life, narrative, landscape etc. Within this group, Motherwell  was also important as a critic and in his writings helped to explain the movement and promote some of the more retiring figures within it, such as Mark Rothko. \n\nUnlike most of his peers in the movement, Motherwell became very interested in printmaking, which he took up in the early 1960s.  This piece combines the unique character of collage with the multiple one of editioned prints; the torn edge of the paper  highly suggestive of  the expressionist character of his paintings.",
