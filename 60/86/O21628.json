            "history_note": "Burges was the most mediaevalising of all the Gothic Revival architects of latter part of the nineteenth century. His chambers, which he decorated between 1858 and 1871, were in a seventeenth century riverside building in an area of London popular with architects, artists and engineers. The flat medieval-style murals were painted in 1861, probably by N. H. J. Westlake and the stained glass was designed by Edward Burne-Jones. The side chair is a Burges design. The Japanese cabinet and the classical figure are evidence of Burges's wide-ranging interests, many of which fed through into his designs.\n[Stephen Astley, British Design at Home, p.63]",
