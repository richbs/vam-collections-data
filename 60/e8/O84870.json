He had first appeared at the Grand in May 1904. It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre. He compiled them in a series of albums.\n\nDuring this engagement Lennard sang three songs, including one about a \u2018gaudy butterfly\u2019, and the sentimental ballad \u2018Skylark\u2019 with the lyrics,\n\nSkylark! Skylark! Winging your flight so high\nSkylark! Skylark! When you get up in the sky\nIf amongst the angels mother you see\nAsk her if she will come down again to poor Daddy and me.\n\nAlso on the bill with Lennard that week was \u2018the Lazy Juggler, Tom Hearn\u2019, another of Cooke\u2019s subjects. Lennard had a fine tenor voice and specialised in ballads, topical songs and parodies. He made his first appearance in London at the Royal Holborn in 1887. He worked in variety and pantomime, and retired in December 1916.",

The caricature comes from the second album of caricatures in a collection of albums owned by the Theatre Museum compiled by the graphic artist George Cooke. It is labelled by the artist 'Geo Cooke HYS BOOKE' and features music hall performers working in the early 20th century.",
