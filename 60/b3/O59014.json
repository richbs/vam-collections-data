The dharmachakra can be seen at the base of the throne molding, flanked by elephants and lions. The enthroned central figure is seated in padmasana, or lotus posture, and has inset silver eyes. The srivatsa emblem on his chest marks him as one \"beloved of fortune\". He is flanked by two further Jinas standing in kayotsarga, or body abandonment posture, making this a trithirtha image. They in turn are flanked by flywhisk-bearing yakshas. There are kneeling devotees below the throne and projecting from the base are the yaksha Gomedha and yakshi Ambika, the attendant deities associated with Neminatha. The backplate is embellished with flying garland bearers.",

            "public_access_description": "This bronze sculpture may be a portable image commissioned by a Jain layman or laymen for presentation to the temple. The central figure is a \u2018Jina\u2019 (salvation-teacher). His identity is not immediately apparent because there is no distinguishing symbol on the throne base. What we can see at the base of the moulding is a \u2018dharmachakra\u2019, a Buddhist symbol representing the \u2018wheel of law\u2019, flanked by elephants and lions. \n\nThe enthroned central figure is seated in \u2018padmasana\u2019 (lotus posture) and has inset silver eyes. The \u2018srivatsa\u2019 emblem on his chest marks him as one \u2018beloved of fortune\u2019. He is flanked by two further Jinas standing in \u2018kayotsarga\u2019, or \u2018body abandonment\u2019 posture, making this a \u2018trithirtha\u2019 image. They in turn are flanked by \u2018yakshas\u2019 (minor deities or earth-spirits) bearing fly-whisks. There are kneeling devotees below the throne. Projecting from the base are the \u2018yaksha\u2019 Gomedha and \u2018yakshi\u2019 Ambika, the attendant deities associated with Neminatha. The back plate is embellished with flying garland bearers.\n\nThe garments worn by the Jinas depicted indicate that the patrons (and recipient temple) were followers of the Shvetambara \u2018White-Clad\u2019 sect.  Many icons of this kind can be seen today adorning the inner sanctuaries of Jain temples or stored in temple strong rooms. Many bear donor inscriptions, usually dated.This altarpiece, surprisingly for an image of this importance, does not.",
