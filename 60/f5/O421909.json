The Nine-tailed Fox is a mythical creature depicted in the Shan Han Jing, a Chinese classic text dates back to the 4th century BC. Stories of the Nine-tailed Fox then appear in various Chinese, Japanese and Korean legends. In the Japanese version, the Nine-Tailed Fox is said to have possessed Tamamo no Mae, a most beautiful and intelligent courtesan who causes Emperor Konoe to be extremely ill. She is chased away by Abe no Yasuchika and her true nature as the Nine-tailed Fox is revealed. After running away to the area of Nasu, the fox is killed and becomes a stone which continually releases toxic gas.",
