This print is one of a series of four computer print-outs that were produced using an electrostatic points printer, an early form of inkjet printer.  The prints were generated by a computer program written by the artist, which was based on a system in which typographical symbols (letters of the alphabet, numbers and punctuation) were linked to corresponding graphical symbols, in this case, triangular forms. Each symbol was then assigned a numerical value that, through the use of a series of mathematical rules, enabled Palumbo to explore the spatial relationships between the symbols.\n\nSuch work shares its roots with much of the systems led art that was produced in the 1960s and the 1970s, in which ideas and process became as important as the object itself.",
