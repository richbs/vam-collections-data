In order to achieve a flush surface circular holes have been cut out of the drawer fronts.  A copper sheet attached inside the drawer covers the hole and provides a surface into which the ivorine drawer handles are screwed.  The cabinet has four turned legs which taper towards the bottom and have chromed metal feet.  At the top of each leg two applied wooden details form a 'capital' - this is purely decorative but appears to be a structural detail formed by the apron extending beyond and through the leg itself.",

It was part of a bedroom suite that included two bedside tables, a bed, a dressing table stool (W.4B-1988), light fittings and built in wardrobes.  Mrs Evelyn Benroy later lived in a flat in St John's Wood where she continued to use this work table and other furniture from Graham Road until her death in 1988.  Mr Benroy was Ern\u00f6 Goldfinger's stockbroker and one of a number of friends/clients for whom Goldfinger designed interiors in the 1930s.",
