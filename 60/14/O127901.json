As an apprentice to his father, he made figures in clay, attracting the interest of the portrait painter Alexander Mosses (1793-1837). Studied in his spare time at the drawing school of the Royal Institution, Liverpool, and apprenticed to a local painter and engraver. Achieved local success as a portrait painter and for his 'candlelight' studies, and exhibited frequently at the Liverpool Academy from 1831, although he did not become a member. Exhibited seven works at the RA in 1840 and 1846, all single figure studies such as a beggar and a friar, except for the portrait of ' Sir Joshua Walmsley' (see p65) who seems to have been his chief patron. The <i>Magazine of Art</i> writer recorded that he 'lived boisterously ... But he also felt the fascination of strong drink'; he is supposed to have declined to paint Prince Albert. He died at Everton, 13 October 1880. \n\nLIT: <i>Magazine of Art</i> June 1882, pp341-3; H C Marillier <i>The Liverpool School of Painters</i> 1904, pp95-8 \n\n<b>Captain Walmsley RN, NVC, FRGS</b> \n370-1872 Neg H314 \nCanvas, 62.9 x 44.5 cm (23\u00be x 17\u00bd ins) \nSigned and dated 'W. Daniels/1848' diagonally bl \nBequeathed by Sir Joshua Walmsley 1872\n \nPresumably a son of Sir Joshua Walmsley, and perhaps an amateur artist, judging from the presence of a paintbrush and easel. The classical bust on the plinth seems to be a copy of the famous marble 'Homer' collected by Charles Townley and represented in Zoffany's painting of his collection (1782, Townley Hall Art Gallery and Museum, Burnley, now in the British Museum).\"",
