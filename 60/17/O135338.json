Mabb\u2019s interest in Morris focuses not only on the design of his patterns but also the inherent contradictions between Morris\u2019s political beliefs \u2013 he was a campaigning Socialist  - and his practice as a designer and business-man \u2013 he made his living creating luxury goods that were affordable only by the upper middle-classes. \n\nIn this collage print (and others from the series) Mabb contrasts the political philosophies and design practices of two artists who held Socialist views and produced designs intended to enhance the lives of the labouring classes. Each used pattern design as a medium to promote a different form of socialism and utopian enterprise. Morris\u2019s designs were hand-printed (and thus labour-intensive and costly), and his patterns were invariably flower and foliage designs suggestive of a nostalgia for rural life; Alexander Rodchenko, a member of the Russian Constructivist group of artists, promoted a radical socialism and produced a number of textile designs which were to be machine-printed (and therefore cheap), with patterns based on commonplace objects \u2013 such as beer bottles and 10 kopeck coins. Mabb unites the craft aesthetic of Morris with the machine aesthetic of Rodchenko, figuratively, but also literally since these prints use pieces of modern hand-blocked Morris papers overlaid with digitally printed reproductions of Rodchenko\u2019s patterns.",
