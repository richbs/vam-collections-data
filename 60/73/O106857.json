            "public_access_description": "This image of an owl is a book illustration for an edition of La Fontaine\u2019s fables published in 1755. The artist, Jean-Baptiste Oudry (1686\u20131755), was one of the outstanding 18th-century painters of animals and hunting scenes. He was also a tapestry designer and originally depicted the fables in 276 tapestry cartoons. These were redrawn by Charles-Nicolas Cochin (1715\u20131790) before being created for the book by several different engravers. Engraving was a popular method of reproducing paintings in books at this time.\n\nThis is one of a collection of images of owls amassed by the poet and scholar Walter Strachan (1903\u20131994). Strachan was fascinated by the art of the book. His interest was inspired by a visit to an exhibition of artists\u2019 books at the National Gallery in London in May 1945. In due course he wrote many articles on the subject, as well as a major reference work, The Artist and the Book in France (published 1969); he also encouraged successive Keepers of the National Art Library at the V&A \u201cto buy them for England.\u201d To this end he visited France every year, to meet the artists, and acquired proof pages to illustrate his articles and to show to potential purchasers of the books, including the V&A. Over the years he amassed a collection of images of owls; some of these were illustrations from livres d\u2019artistes, and others were designed especially for him as gifts or greetings. The collection of owls began with a visit to the artist Roger Chastel (1897-1981) in 1952, where he witnessed the printing of Le Bestiaire de Paul Eluard. In a subsequent article (\u201cGenesis and Growth of a Collection\u201d, for Connoisseur, 1972) he explained: \u201cMy article on Chastel\u2019s Bestiaire had the happy result of bringing me a special print on Auvergne paper of the owl which I had admired in the book. Contacts in the art-world of Paris are close and friendly, and I was marked down as an owl-man, in consequence of which I have gradually been given dedicated owl prints and originals in every medium from pen and ink to enamel\u2026\u201d Most of the prints in Strachan's collection were contemporary autograph prints or proofs; this is a rare instance where he acquired an older print taken from a published book.",
