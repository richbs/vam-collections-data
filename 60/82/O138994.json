Since guests usually stood and mingled, the gowns could include complex bustles, appliqu\u00e9 and skirt details, which would be crushed if sat on. \n\nIn his book the Little Dictionary of Fashion (1954) Christian Dior (1905-57) described cocktail dresses as \u2018elaborate and dressy afternoon frocks\u2019, preferably in black taffeta, satin, chiffon and wool. These confections became the personification of the \u2018little black dress\u2019 and were often accessorised with gloves and small, elaborate hats.\n\nThis dress was designed by Michael Sherard (1910\u201398) for his acclaimed 1958 spring collection.  \n\nThe flamenco dress was a recurring theme in 1950s cocktail and evening wear. Sherard\u2019s version has a bell-like skirt and train made entirely of lace, his trademark fabric.",

In 1946, Sherard opened his own house at 24 Connaught Street, where his fist collection, shown in February 1947, included evening dresses in cotton and more formal designs in silk, many decorated with a beautiful floral corsage, some of which appeared to be dappled with dew.  Sherard worked extensively with lace; the V&A has a black Swiss lace evening dress with raised, self-fabric flowers, designed by Sherard in 1957 for his acclaimed Spring 1958 collection.  The couturier presented this dress to Cecil Beaton for the exhibition 'Fashion: An Anthology' (1971) at the V&A.  Sherard closed his salon in 1964.",
