They were conceived for the modern woman who wished to appear absolutely contemporary.\n\nThis is a classic tailored Chanel suit from 1960. Its bright scarlet check wool is neatly finished at collar, cuffs and pockets with Chanel\u2019s customary attention to detail. The semi-fitted, single breasted jacket has small, square, patch pockets, placed just below the bust and over the hips. Double lines of topstitching add a crisp finish to each pocket. They are fastened with small, custom made gilt buttons, with a leaf design and encircled with scarlet wool.\n\nChanel suits are now acknowledged to be classics of international design. Off the body they can appear somewhat severe and unremarkable but when worn their lines soften and they garments are immensely flattering and utterly chic. Chanel had complete understanding of the female body and her clothes demonstrated her genius for perfect proportion.",
