The eye brows are low ridges over the eyes which have  pronounced upper lids and undulating lower lids that slant towards the ears.  The mouth has full lips with a beatific smile.  Two concentric grooves are on the neck.\n      The head emerges out of a wedge-shaped back slab which bears broad chisel marks slanting across it into which traces of mortar adhere.  The ears, too, are carved out from the back slab to which they ramain attached.  There is  a mortice hole on the top of the head towards the rear of the <i>ushnisha</i>, which slopes down towards the back slab behind.",

They noted that this head is quite distinct from all other representations of the Buddha either at Amluk or other familiar Gandharan types with only one other known piece with a find spot of similar style now at the British Museum, which was found at Kafir-Kot ( a few miles away from Amluk) in the Swat Valley, OA 1899.6-9.44,  see Zwalf, W.,<u> A Catalogue of the Gandharan Sculpture in the British Museum</u>, British Museum Press, 1996, 2 vols, No. 42. This head was found among the debris excavated by  Philip Wright from <i>Stupa</i> B, which was found to be very decayed. The <i>stupa</i> lacked the usual square base, having only a round base, fifteen feet in diameter, which stood on a paved terrace surrounded by small <i>stupas</i>, of varying sizes. Only the square bases of these, which varied from five to ten feet square, survived. Barger and Wright suggest that this head bears some resemblance to some of the sandstone heads from Mathura, eg V&amp;A IM3-1927. Zwalf  in his catalogue notes there are other similar sculptures, but none with identified findspots.",
