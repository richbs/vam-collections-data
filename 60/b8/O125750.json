He visited Italy in 1743, and subsequently became Inspector of the Dresden picture gallery (1748), professor at the Dresden Academy (1764) and head of the new school of art attached to the Meissen porcelain factory (c. 1765-70). Essentially an eclectic painter, he was much influenced by Italianate ideal landscape and by the Dutch 17th century landscape painters. \n\nAscribed to Christian DIETRICH \n84 \nROCKY LANDSCAPE WITH HERDSMEN \n<i>Canvas</i>  \n18 5/8 X 26 1/2 (47.3 X 68.5) \nTownshend Bequest \n1368-1869 \n \nOriginally accepted as by Dietrich (1893 <i>Catalogue,</i>p. 178), this attribution no longer seems entirely convincing, though Dietrich did produce paintings of this kind, based on Dutch 17th century compositions. For a recent discussion of Dietrich's eclecticism, see A. Chudzikowski, 'Pastiches in the works of C. W. E. Dietrich' in <i>Bulletin du Mus\u00e9e National de Varsooie,</i>vii, 1966, p. 113 ff. \n\n<i>Prov.</i>The Rev. C. H. Townshend; bequeathed to the Museum in 1868.\"",
