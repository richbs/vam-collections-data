The Museum Number is in the top right hand corner. This is a very wide trouser panel and it is probable that this type of trouser was worn over a padded pair for extra warmth. The pattern is large-scale and the embroidered fabric is soft and pliable.\nPieced: a slightly longer section has been added down the right hand side. The top edge has been cut through the embroidery. There is a black line embroidered along the bottom and also down the right hand side, although this has been concealed by the added piece.  Where some of the silk has fallen out in the lower left hand area, the cotton ground has been left in a regular pattern of holes where the stitching once was.\nThe pattern is a series of black diagonal lines from lower right to upper left.  \nThere are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: [a] shades of light green ground with flowerheads in pink and red or pink and light blue.  This border is either side of:\\[b] a slightly wider band with a white ground with a large triangular pink flower, a blue flower outlined in dark red and a smaller blossom arranged as a meander on a chevron stem.\n[2] wider stripe: black ground with two diamond-shaped blocks of flowers: 9 white flowers outlined in red and a downward pointing spray of pink flowers outlined in green and dark green.\nThreads: white, black, light green, dark green, red, dark red, yellow, light blue, blue, orange, grey silk; 2S; dark blue cotton.",
