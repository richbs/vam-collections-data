This was a technique used by joiners to link the parts of furniture using a tenon, or pared-down end, which slotted into a mortise, or rectangular hole. It would then be locked in place with wooden pegs. Stools were the most common form of seating. More expensive stools, especially those made for bedchambers, were covered with upholstery which might match the bed hangings.  \n\nThis example has a wooden seat and is well-made. The legs were shaped by turning on a pole-lathe, after which further decoration was carved; the carving on this example is unusually elaborate. Stools would have been particularly useful with \u2018draw\u2019 tables, which became popular around 1600. These had extra leaves that could be 'drawn' or pulled out, to increase the size of the table top.\n\nOn loan to Lamport Hall.",
