Sometimes the design is a highly stylised series of mouldings giving the illusion of vertical folds. Linenfold was common in Northern Europe from about the mid 15th century with frequent variations, and remained in use in Britain into the early 17th century. During the 19th century linenfold became popular again as an element of the Gothic Revival style. When used on wainscot regular linenfold panels provide a relatively small scale pattern animated by light and shade. Linenfold was usually produced on thin sheets of quarter-sawn oak using moulding planes, then finished with a chisel.",
