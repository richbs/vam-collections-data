            "public_access_description": "This ivory statuette of a lady with a mirror is probably made in Germany or perhaps in France in ca. 1750 by an unknown artist. The figure and seat may have been carved in the 18th century, and set on a base made in the nineteenth century. It is difficult to find close parallels for the work, although it is broadly comparable with ornamental ivories made for the German courts, sometimes by French artists, during the eighteenth century, such as those at Kassel and Schwerin.",
