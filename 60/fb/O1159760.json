It was fashionable at the time for children to wear teddy bear coats and hats and this muff would have completed the outfit. Other teddy bear novelties included a baby bottle holder, a purse and even a somersaulting bear. The novelties are an extra way to add to a teddy bear collection. This particular bear is American, where the teddy bear was initially first popular. Not all American makers marked their bears but typical characteristics are a long firm body and short, straight limbs.",
