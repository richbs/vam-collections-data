            "public_access_description": "Jean Lemaire called le gros Lemaire (1601- 1659) was born in Danmartin-en-Go\u00eble, near Paris, and was first trained by Claude Vignon (1593-1670). He went to Rome around 1624 and met there Nicolas Poussin (1594-1665) and Jacques Stella (1596-1657). He became a close collaborator and friend of Poussin and returned to Paris in 1639. He was then appointed 'Garde du Cabinet de peinture de Sa Majest\u00e9 et son Chasteau du Louvre et Thuilleries', which was to become the first collection of the future Louvre Museum. \n\nThis painting is a fine example of Lemaire's production of landscape paintings, which combines imaginary and realistic architectural features in a picturesque setting. In this painting, five figures dressed all'antica draw antique Roman ruins, some of which have been identified. It illustrates the fascination for the Antique during the 17th century as well as the taste for idyllic landscapes often peopled with mythological figures.",

Before 1800</u>, London, 1973, pp. 227-228, cat. no. 283.\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\nNicolas POUSSIN (1593/94-1665) \nFrench School \nBorn in Villers in Normandy, at about the age of 18 he travelled to Paris, where in 1621 he worked with Philippe de Champaigne. He went to Rome in 1623, returning to Paris in 1639 at the invitation of the Secretary of State, to work for the king, but in 1642 left for Rome, where he remained until his death. He stands for the revival of interest in classical painting in France; his style was formed under the influence of Raphael and the Antique. \n\n\nFollower of Nicolas POUSSIN \n\n283\nARTISTS SKETCHING AMONG RUINS \nCanvas \n38 \u00bd x 28 \u00be (97.8 x 73) \nlonides Bequest \nCAI.22 \n\nThis painting was in the Norton and lonides collections and in Magne's Oeuvre catalogue (1914) as by Poussin and it was tentatively accepted as such by Long (1925). However, it differs from Poussin both in subject matter and in detail of treatment and it has not been accepted in any reconstruction of Poussin's oeuvre since Magne, though its high quality has ensured for it a respectable place in Poussin's immediate circle. Grautoff (1914) found the subject too realistic for Poussin and suggested a Poussin follower influenced by Caravaggio. L. Hourticq (written communication, 1931) thought the figures were by Poussin and the architecture by his friend and collaborator Jean Lemaire (1597-1659). Walter Friedlaender (oral communication, 1934) also attributed the architecture to Lemaire. \nThe connection with Lemaire has been elucidated by Sir Anthony Blunt (1959), who compared CAI.22 with a painting of the same subject by Lemaire in the royal collection, Windsor Castle. Although differing in detail, the two paintings are very similar in general terms and some features - such as the crouching figure in the centre - are practically identical. Blunt summed up the comparison in these words: 'The connexion between the two paintings is somewhat puzzling, because the V. & A. canvas is much more vigorous than the work of Lemaire, and yet is too feeble in detail to be an original by Poussin which might have served as the artist's model. It must for the moment be attributed to an unknown but close follower of Poussin imitating his style of the mid-1630s.\u2019 According to Magne (1914) there is an engraving after this painting by Louis de Chatillon (1639-1734), but this is not recorded in G.

The composition formula relies on an interesting play of vertical lines and superimposition of plans which provide the picture with a sense of grandeur. \n\nThe right hand-side archway presented in diagonal derived partially from the Arch of Portugal, an archway in Rome destroyed in 1662, which recurs in other paintings by  Lemaire (see <i>View at dawn with a triumphal arch</i>, Museo di Roma, Rome and <i>View with a triumphal arch and the coliseum</i>, Federico Zeri collection, Mentana).\n\nThe low relief shows Septimius Severus and his wife Julia Domna attending a sacrifice and derives from the internal pilaster of the Arch of the Moneychangers erected in honour of the Imperial family by merchants and bankers of the Forum Boarium and later incorporated in the church of San Giorgio.\n\nThe figures dressed <i>all'antica</i> may have been drawn in collaboration with Poussin such as in <i>Landscape with the story of Theses and Etra</i>, Mus\u00e9e Cond\u00e9, Chantilly. The figure seen from the back shows a pentimento compared with the preparatory drawing, formerly attributed to Poussin, (Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest, Inv. 2885) in which the young man stretches his right arm to point out the column. \n\nThe sketchbooks leaning against the column in the foreground may allude to the 'museo cartaceo', a compendium of about 7000 drawings, watercolours and prints of antiquities, architecture, fauna and flora commissioned by the Roman collector Cassiano del Pozzo and to which Lemaire most likely contributed (the publication of the catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of this 'museum of paper' is currently in progress). \n\nThis painting is a good example of the taste for Arcadian vision of the Italian landscape, often peopled with dressed all'antica and mythological figures. Despite a few elements of realism such as the Roman monuments, this painting is really a 'fantaisie' which combines imaginary and realistic architectural features in a picturesque setting. This trend is particularly well represented by the oeuvre of Claude Lorrain and Nicolas Poussin, of whom Jean Lemaire appears to have been a close friend and collaborator, and would be further developed in the 18th century in such compositions called 'capriccio'.\n\nAlthough France and England became the new centres of landscape art in the 18th century, the Italian and Dutch traditions retained their authority. However the Arcadian vision of Italy increasingly tended towards a more precise observation of nature. \n\nSome of the most exciting developments took place in Venice, in the soft scenes of Francesco Zuccarelli (1702-1788), inspired by Claude Lorrain (1604-1682), and the fresh, spontaneous landscapes of Marco Ricci (1676-1730). Wealthy patrons, often accompanied by artists, on The Grand Tour, created a market for veduta and capriccio paintings, respectively topographical and fantasist landscape paintings. \n\nLandscape conventions were further enriched by foreign artists working in Italy, responding both to the beauty of Italian light and scenery celebrated by the Latin poets and vividly captured in the most popular landscapes of Claude Lorrain, Nicolas Poussin (1594-1665) and Gaspard Dughet (1615-1675).",
