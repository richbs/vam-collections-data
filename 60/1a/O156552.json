This box was produced in St Petersburg in about 1815, whilst the mosaic predates it from Rome, ca.1810.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver,  mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
