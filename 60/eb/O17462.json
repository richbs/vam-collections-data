In 1841 the sculptor Edward Hodges Baily (1788-1867) showed a bust of Prince Albert ('unfinished') at the Royal Academy, London, presumably this piece. In 1848 it was bought by the collector Joseph Neeld  (1789-1856), whose collection of Victorian sculpture was later dispersed. The bust was acquired by the Museum in 1964 from a London dealer.\n\nPeople\nEdward Hodges Baily was born in Bristol in south-west England and began his career modelling wax portraits. He later trained under the sculptor John Flaxman (1755-1826) and enrolled at the Royal Academy Schools, London, in 1808. His public sculpture in London included reliefs on the Marble Arch and perhaps most famously the figure of Horatio Nelson, Viscount Nelson (1758-1805), for the column in Trafalgar Square. He also executed a large number of portrait busts.\n\nPlaces\nJoseph Neeld amassed an important collection of British works of art, including Baily's bust of Prince Albert, after he inherited \u0153900,000 from his maternal grandfather. He bought Grittleton House in Wiltshire, where his collection was housed. James Thomson (1800-1883) designed this house in a revived Romanesque style; numerous paintings hung in the great Staircase Hall there. As well as the bust of Prince Albert, Neeld owned a figure of Eve Listening to the Voice by Baily.",
