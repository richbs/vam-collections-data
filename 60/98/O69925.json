The two figures engraved on the weight can be identified as emperors because of their crowns and halos, which signify their high status. However, their images are generic representations rather than portraits, and so it is difficult to identify them precisely. The absence of any Christian symbols on their clothing suggests an early date, before Christianity spread to the Empire.\nThere are important collections of similar weights in the British Museum, London, and in the Menil Collection, Houston, Texas.",
