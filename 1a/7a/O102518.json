She was a particular favourite of the young Princess Victoria (later Queen Victoria), an avid theatre-goer, who, in her art classes, would then draw the performers.  The results are held in the Royal Archives, and include many sketches of Duvernay in different roles.  \nDuvernay is wearing the pink, frilled Spanish-style dress worn by Florinda, heroine of Jean Coralli's 1836 ballet Le Diable Bo\u00eeteaux (The Devil on Two Sticks or The Lame Devil), to dance the Cachucha, which was the high-spot of the ballet.  The Cachucha is a stylized Spanish dance, originally from Cuba; it covers a range of movements, sometimes gracefully calm, sometimes sprightly and sometimes impassioned hip swinging, while making great use of the castanets.",

It was published in 1837.  \nDuvernay is wearing the pink, frilled Spanish-style dress worn by Florinda, heroine of Jean Coralli's ballet, to dance the Cachucha, which was the high-spot of the ballet.  The Cachucha is a stylized Spanish dance, originally from Cuba; it covers a range of movements, sometimes gracefully calm, sometimes sprightly and sometimes impassioned hip swinging, while making great use of the castanets.\n\nHistorical significance: The large souvenir prints of the Romantic ballet, issued in the 1830s and 1840s, are among the most evocative images of dance in the 19th century.  Lithography, with its soft quality, enhanced by the delicate yet rich hand-colouring, was ideally suited to the subject - the ballerinas who dominated ballet in the mid-century and the romanticised settings in which they performed; style and subject were perfectly matched.  The British lithographs are notable for capturing individual performers and their style, often clearly in a theatrical setting.  They capture dance and its interpreters at one of its greatest periods",
