The large cup and saucer was designed in 1991 and added to the range in 1992, being launched at the NEC in February that  year. Unlike the earlier items in the range, the large cup and saucer was made from the outset at Brixworth, near Northampton.\n\nHoldenby Designs was established by Suzanne Katkhuda and Jim Powell in 1987 to manufacture and sell Katkhuda's designs. The company was first based in the stable yard of Holdenby House, a stately home in Northamptonshire. These premises were rapidly outgrown, and at the end of 1991 the company moved to the nearby village of Brixworth. In 1993, further premises were acquired in Parsonage Street, Tunstall, Stoke-on-Trent, where white earthenware was produced.",
