Illustrated p. 155, text p. 243.\nText reads: The architect Vos Naude explained that the Edenvale congregation did not have the money for a church as well as a hall but needed both. He therefore designed a dual purpose building in which the pulpit slid out of the way to allow conversion of the space into a theatre. Air conditioning and controlled lighting dispensed with the need for windows, so he was able to build unpierced outer walls, which made it unnecessary to black out the hall when using it as a theatre. The church was inaugurated in February 1976. Vos's plan called for a bell at the top of the tower, which was not installed.\nDuring the 1970s and 80s most of the new Afrikaner Protestant churches were designed with few windows in their outer walls. The reason, in my opinion, were both practical and ideological.",
