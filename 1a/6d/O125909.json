(some col.)\nExhibtion catalogue\n<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, pp. 121-123\nThe following is an extract from the text of the entry:\n\nThe sketch has been laid down on thin card.\n\nThis drawing is connected with the painting \u2018Waterloo Bridge, from Whitehall Stairs, June 18th, 1817\u2019  which Constable exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1832.  For the early stages of this design and bibliographical references see the note to No. 174, and see the drawing No. 175.  No. 173 belongs to a group of studies made from nature for the subject in which the ceremonial is not shown: these are listed by Sutton (<i>Connoisseur</i>, Vol. CXXVI, 1955, pp. 249 and 250).\n\nHe points out that No. 173 is probably drawn from the upper windows of a house on the river.  The gardens in the foreground appear to be those of Fife House, but may be nearer to the bridge (Sutton, <i>loc. cit.</i>, p. 250).  No. 173 has usually been regarded as having been made about 1817, the year of the opening of the Bridge (see the <i>Inventory of Art Objects 1888</i>, p. 26; Holmes, p. 243; L. ed. S., p. 284; L. ed. M., p. 417).  There is, however, no evidence that Constable thought of painting the subject before 1819.  The style of the drawing would suggest that it was made at an early stage of the composition, but the possibility cannot be excluded that it may have been made as late as 1826 when Constable visited Pembroke House to sketch the terrace and add to his canvas.",
