The term is also used to describe prominent circular, oval or elliptical motifs in ornament, especially those framing figurative subjects.\n\nSir Isaac Newton (1642-1727) was an English physicist and mathematician, who was the culminating figure of the scientific revolution of the 17th century.\nNewton's greatest achievement was his work in physics and celestial mechanics, which culminated in the theory of universal gravitation. His treatise on gravitation, presented in Principia Mathematica (1687), was in his own account inspired by the sight of a falling apple. \nIn 1703 he was elected president of the Royal Society and was re-elected each year until his death. He was knighted in 1705 by Queen Anne, the first scientist to be so honoured for his work.",
