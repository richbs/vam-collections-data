After working with modulated line, in a series of drypoints, Albers went on to make a series of lithographs collectively titled 'Graphic Tectonic' with very precise linear structures.  He then began work on a series of wood- and lino- cuts. In some of these relief prints he plays with the curvilinear patterns which characterise the earlier drypoints, in others he uses the very precise, straight line geometric patterns which represent an evolution  of the geometry of Graphic Tectonic.",
