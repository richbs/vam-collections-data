The piece is torn in half (the small piece may be 2172-1900), is stained and has holes. In the Abbasid  period (AD750-1258) fabrics, called tiraz,  were made in present  day Iraq and Egypt. The word  came to  mean honorific robes with  woven  or embroidered inscriptions.  Text from the Koran was  embroided across the fabric with a line  of geometric shapes above  that were probably for decoration.  Text might also include  information such as the name of the  reigning caliph, place of  production and date.",
