Mirror cases with closing shutters began to be used in Iran in the 1660s, when mirror glass began to be imported from Europe. Many such luxury items were,like this one, made of \u2018lacquer\u2019. This material consisted primarily of varnished paintwork on pasteboard, but it originated through the imitation of Chinese lacquer.\n\nThe decoration here consists of miniaturised patterns. The artist was probably Razi Muzahhib, who worked in Tehran in the late 19th century. Razi specialised in non-figurative decoration, using minutely detailed designs in a variety of traditional modes.",
