It shows a man in peasant's clothing sitting at a table with his elbows leaning on a round table facing the right. He is smoking a pipe and has a jug by his side. He is probably at a public house. His clothes are simple, a white shirt with reddish trousers and hat and a waistcoat. The execution of the painting is skillful with tiny brushstrokes and suggests it was undertaken by a professional artist, although we do not know who this was as the pianting is not signed. This painting is very similar in style and content to another one from the same dolls' house.",
