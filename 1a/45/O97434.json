The whistle toys are said to have been carved in the Berchtesgaden region, the merry-go-round in Seiffen in the Erzgebirge. The simple merry-go-round was popular in the Far East long before it became common in Europe. The earliest European examples come from Germany. They were crude and colourful but played a tune when the handle was turned thereby becoming known as 'tinkle toys'. There are many examples of toys like these in the trade books of the time.",
