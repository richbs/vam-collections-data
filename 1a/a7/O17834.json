For some years, red had been considered the most appropriate colour against which to hang paintings.  Here, heavy red cloth is hung against the walls and screens, attempting an overall impression of grandeur.  The watercolours, in gilded mounts and encased in gilded gesso frames, are hung very close to each other, creating an effect of great richness and importance.  Charles Lock Eastlake, the nephew of the painter (see catalogue no. 37), in his Hints on Household Taste published in 1868, delivered a warning that is still pertinent today: the heavily ornamented frames, designed in a hybrid Baroque-Rococo, French-Italian style, were - and are - 'so brittle that, instead of protecting the picture, they have to be handled more carefully than the picture itself, and are liable to chip at the slightest blow'.",
