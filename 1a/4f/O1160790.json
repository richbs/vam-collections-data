A new theatre was built on the site, opening on 18 September 1809 with a performance of Macbeth, featuring the  theatre's manager, John Philip Kemble.  The cost of rebuilding Covent Garden was so great that Kemble raised the price of the seats and this provoked an uproar on the first night, with the performance drowned out by shouting and hissing. The evening ended in chaos when the audience refused to leave the building and the police were called. This was the start of three months of protests, known as the Old Price Riots. Kemble tried to carry on with performances but his audiences, armed with rattles, were equally determined to keep up the disruption until there was a return to the old prices of the previous theatre.  Eventually, Kemble was forced to admit defeat and lower the seat prices.\n\nThis caricature shows the interior of the theatre at the start of the rioting. Banners and slogans are displayed by the audience demanding a return to the 'Old Prices'. On stage magistrates from Bow Street threaten to read the Riot Act.",
