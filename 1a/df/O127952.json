            "public_access_description": "Candace Bahouth studied Fine Art at Syracuse University in the USA and tapestry weaving under the tutelage of Archie Brennan in Edinburgh.  Bahouth produces large and small scale tapestries, exploring the contemporary trend towards smaller, less monumentual work.  This trend was reflected in the brief for the first tapestry biennale in Lausanne in 1962, which stated that all exhibits were restricted to a minimum size of five metres square.  Figurative rather than abstract imagery continued to attract many weavers in the 20th century and Bahouth is no exception.  Self expression and presentation are extremely important in the subjects featured in her weaving and she tends to concentrate on individuals that represent their culture or sub culture by the clothes they wear, their hairstyle, make up and jewellery.  Girl Punk and Boy Punk demonstrate how Bahouth often depicts a character whose appearance plays an integral role in their society.  Her weaving concentrates on the figure, which she then brings to life in relief using trompe l'oeil effects, adding a mixture of appropriate accessories and warp-woven fabrics.  The subjects in Girl Punk and Boy Punk were first seen by the artist in a tea shop in Bath.",
