The dancer is performing in front of the prince. A drummer and a group of vocal musicians are seen performing standing behind her. There are other courtiers who are standing. \n\nThe prince can possibly be identified as Shaukat Jang who held court at Purnea and was noted for his profligate habits. He was a cousin of Siraj ud-Daul's.\n\nFor a stylistic parallel please see D.1201-1903. This painting is slightly coarser than the darbar scenes of 'Alivardi Khan but cannot be very much later in date.",

Shaukat Jang, who held court at Purnea, was the cousin and rival of Siraj ud-daula, and shared the same vices: 'the same ignorant pride, insane ambition, uncontrollable passions, looseness of tongue and addiction to drink' (Sarkar [1973] II, p.478). He was killed in battle while trying to overthrow his cousin in 1756.",
