It is red and green with  yellow and white markings.  The underside is gold coloured.  On the tricycle sits a child made of celluloid and painted to show a red suit, shoes and cap, blond hair and blue eyes.  This is a typical use of Western features, found on many child representations.  The hands are drilled with holes to house the ends of the steering bar of the cycle.  Behind the figure is a bell.\nWhen wound up the tricycle moves on two wheels set under the centre area and connected to the mechanism; there is a third wheel at the front.  At the same time the bell rings.",
