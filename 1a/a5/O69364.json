This narrative shows two scenes: the first, in the foreground, and the second in the upper right hand corner of the image. In the foreground is a seated teacher, in the centre, facing right, dressed in a blue jama flecked with gold, blessing a child dressed in yellow, who bows before him; the child's father or guardian sits behind. Seven other pupils sit behind and near the teacher and an eighth boy is standing in the <i>kukkar,</i> or cockerel, position as a punishment. Each pupil has a book that opens to the left and is therefore probably Persian or Arabic. The scene is set in a courtyard enclosed by niched walls; there is a grey pavilion to the left and niched walls,and a tree to the right. The floor is spread with a brigbt red carpet with an arabesque pattern, the teacher has a white rug. The second scene at upper right repeats the courtyard in a simplified form. The teacher watches as the pupil and his guardian walk away; there is a small section of undulating landscape beyond the walls.",

The foreground depicts a courtyard in which a teacher blesses a child whose father or guardian sits behind him, with seven other pupils nearby. An eighth is being punished by having to stand in the kukkar, or 'cockerel' position: looping his arms around his legs, he bends to hold his ears. A book being read by one of the pupils is in Arabic script, but this does not seem to be a religious school as the variety of headgear worn suggests communities. The second scene, at upper right, shows the same courtyard in abbreviated form, the teaching watching as the pupil and his guardian walk away.",
