By 1939, the Scheme had acquired some 900 embroideries but the outbreak of WWII closed the Scheme and the collection was retained by the four original art schools.  Glasgow School of Art was instrumental in re-starting the scheme late in 1944 and the NDS was gradually expanded to encompass other art schools in the United Kingdom where embroidery was taught.  The NDS was disbanded in 1961 when funding was withdrawn, although it was recognised that the Scheme had achieved its aims.  Its collection was divided and distributed to various organisations included the Embroiderers Guild, The National Museum of Scotland and the V&A. \n\nThis folder is an example of the teaching aids produced by the Scheme, illustrating various ways in which embroidery stitches could be used and designs interpreted.",
