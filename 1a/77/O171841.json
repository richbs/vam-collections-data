This terracotta figure was made in Bologna in the third quarter of the fifteenth century. Her hair is plaited across the forehead, and her veil rests on the back of her head, leaving the ears exposed. Her cloak is joined on the breast by a clasp and cords with tassels, and below falls in rounded decorative folds. The Child's arms are raised.\n\nThe group is extensively damaged and the throne and base are modern.\n\nThe quality of the present group is low, and the International Gothic folds at the base of the cloak suggest it was produced by a Lombard or Emilian sculptor active in Bologna. No other work by the same hand has been identified.",
