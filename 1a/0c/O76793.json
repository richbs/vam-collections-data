This paper has a fleur-de-lis watermark that suggests a possible date of around 1680. The design is very similar to the border of a later 17th-century cotton printed with a lace-pattern, in the V&A (inv. no. 1605-1872). It also has strong similarities with the embroidery style known as 'black-work', in which patterns of flowers and fruit were stitched in black and silver thread on a white ground. One of only a handful of pre-1700 papers to survive, this design has been found in several different locations, including two houses in Surrey - in Kingston upon Thames (this piece) and Epsom - one in Newcastle upon Tyne, and one in a wooden box.",

The building used by Boots is dated <i>circa</i> 1599. The paper was on a wooden partition wall, uncovered by subsequent decoration, and presents an unusual example of the preservation of original d\u00e9cor. A lining paper with the same pattern, slightly cruder in execution and with the background omitted (E.313A[sic]-1940 neg B.63), is lettered <i>Roger Hudson Trunk Maker, Coney Street, York</i>. It was found in a small wooden box and given to the museum by the Reverend J. Harvey Bloom. It measures\n36.8 x 34.3 cm (E.373-1940; E.373A-1940 neg B.63). See Jean Hamilton, 'Early English Wallpapers', <i>Connoisseur</i>, July 1977, 201, pl 1.
