Most theatres in the 19th century would have had some made to mark grand openings or milestone performances. By the end of the First World War however the practice had generally died out, only being revived very occasionally,  more often at London's opera houses than any other theatres.\n\nThis silk programme was produced for a performance of Les Cloches de Corneville adapted by H.B. Farnie and R. Reece from the original French version with music by Planquette, preceded by The Happy Man, described as an 'Oriental Musical Extravaganza'. Les Cloches de Corneville was a huge hit for its producer Alex Henderson, at the Folly Theatre where it had opened on 28 February 1878, and later at the Globe, where it was transferred on 31 August 1878.",
