This was produced as a souvenir of the 'Grand Fashionable Night', 4 February 1859 at Hengler's Circus or 'Grand Cirque Variet\u00e9' in Liverpool. The evening comprised mostly of feats of horsemanship and clowning, with some acrobatics including a Risley act, juggling, and a trapeze act, with the dramatic Turpin's Ride to York, or the Death of Black Bess! in the second half of the show. \n\nFrederick Charles Hengler (1820-1887), always known as Charles, opened Hengler's Cirque in Liverpool in 1857. A successful proprietor, he opened similar permanent circus buildings in Glasgow and Dublin in 1863, in Hull in 864, in Birmingham and Bristol in 1866, and in London in 1871. Hengler's London building was rebuilt as the Palladium Theatre in 1910. Charles Hengler came from an established family of circus performers and an accomplished horseman. His brothers performed a celebrated tightrope act, and this playbill advertises the forthcoming appearance of John Milton Hengler on the tightrope on 21st February 1859.",
