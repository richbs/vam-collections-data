This cross may have been worn, but it is more likely to have been hung in the home as an object of devotion, and to protect the members of the family from spiritual harm.  When it was acquired it was described as usually suspended at a bed-head.\n\nIt comes from Romagna, and the swirling pattern of the filigree is typical of that used in the north-east of Italy, in the region around Venice.  It was bought for \u00a31 as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
