At that time wool was thought to be a suitable material for close-fitting garments like swimwear because of its elastic qualities. The disadvantage was that it became heavy when waterlogged.\n\nThis one-piece bathing suit has an aerodynamic (and slimming) navy side stripe. It is made in stocking stitch with a ribbed waist panel for extra shaping and support. The straps cross over the fashionable low-cut back and through two loops at the front. The owner bought it from the French department store Galeries Lafayette in Regent Street, London.",
