In 1888 he founded the Guild of Handicraft in the East End of London with the intention of reviving traditional craft skills and providing satisfying employment in a deprived area of the city. Trained originally as an architect, he is known also for his highly innovative furniture, metalwork, silver and jewellery designs. \n\nThe peacock was one of Ashbee's favourite and most distinctive motifs and he is known to have designed about a dozen peacock jewels in the years around 1900. Family tradition is that this brooch was designed for his wife, Janet. It was made by Ashbee's Guild of Handicraft Ltd. at Essex House on the Mile End Road, London.",

However, its provenance and design endow this peacock with a particular significance.  Alan Crawford (in 'C.R. Ashbee. Architect, Designer & Romantic Socialist' pp. 359-363) quotes family papers which reveal that on 15 November 1899 Cyril Kelsey, a guild apprentice, wrote to Janet Ashbee that 'Brook [one of the Guild's jewellers] has not started on your peacocks yet, no chance till after Christmas'. Four months later, on 22 March 1900 Ashbee wrote to his wife 'Your peacock is finished. He is at the present moment pinned on my coat and is preening his tail and looking at himself with his ruby eye'.  Ashbee states that Janet's father was paying for the peacock.  Family tradition is that this particular peacock is the one that is described.  It was in Janet's possession until late in her life, and then passed to her daughter.  Margaret Flower, writing in 1951 when her information could have come directly from Janet who lived until 1961, stated that it had been made by 'Gebardt', who can be identified from Guild records as  Adolf Gebardt. Two almost identical designs by Ashbee for the brooch-pendant are in Chelsea Public Library.",
