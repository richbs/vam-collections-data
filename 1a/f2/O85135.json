The bowl's design was so fine, however, that for many years it was displayed as a Chinese piece.\n\nIt is made of fritware, also called stone paste and quartz paste. Middle Eastern potters developed the material as a response to the challenge posed by Chinese porcelain. In the 12th and early 13th centuries, potters in Kashan and other centres in Iran used fritware to produce fine wares decorated in an astonishing range of styles. Occasionally the potters created wares which openly emulated Chinese ceramics, such as this bowl.",
