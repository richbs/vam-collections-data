There is a partly open door in the background which shows a good use of perspective.\n\nIn the foreground it is possible to make out four figures plus two additional faces. The central figure appears to be that of a raja, and though his face is not visible his body is  adorned with jewellery and he wears a striped lower garment. There are two women with long black curly hair in front of him, one of them is handing a sword to him. Below them two faces are just visible, they both have a single naga-hood (snake head). Another figure to the left of the painting is just visible.\n\nThe left hand side of this painting links to the right hand side of IS.10-1885.\n\nNote: Description of painting  in Burgess suggests a much bigger painting with the figures in the background more intact.\nGriffiths book  or Narayan\u2019s photographs should have the whole thing pre fire of June 1885 - check.",

These cave paintings date from the 1st century BC to about AD 480 and are the oldest surviving examples of painting in India. They depict stories from the lives of the Buddha (the Jatakas). This one shows scenes from the Champaka Jataka.\n\nThe Ajanta cave complex was discovered in 1819 and attempts were made to document the paintings inside them. In 1844 Major Robert Gill was commissioned to make copies. Unfortunately most of the paintings he completed were destroyed in a fire in 1866. To make up for this loss, from 1872 to 1885 John Griffiths from the Bombay School of Art and seven Indian students spent every winter at the caves. This is one of the approximately 300 paintings they produced.",

They depict scenes from the lives of the Buddha and date from the 1st century BC to about AD 480. The cave complex was discovered in 1819 and since then attempts have been made to document the paintings inside them. In 1844 Major Robert Gill was commissioned to make copies. Unfortunately most of the paintings he completed were destroyed in a fire in 1866. To make up for this loss, from 1872, John Griffiths from the Bombay school of Art and seven Indian students spent every winter for the following 13 years at the caves producing approximately 300 paintings, of which this is one.",
