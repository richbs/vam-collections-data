Oliver (b.1957), working with Nigel Grierson, Christopher Bigg (b.1962) and Simon Larbalestier (b.1962), has, under the umbrella title of 23 Envelope (established in 1981), and more recently as V/23 created a distinctive body of original work for the independant label 4AD founded by Ivo Watts-Russell (b.1957). The work of 23 Envelope is centred around experimentation with old and new type-faces, with layouts, fine calligraphy, creative photography, colour photocopies and more recently the Quantel <i>Paintbox</i> computer system. To do justice to the 'R&D' aspects of their work, 4AD and 23 Envelope pay considerable attention to paper types and printing standards. 23 Envelope's designs match the clarity and gravity of work by PSA and Brody while preserving the subtle nuances seen in the sleeve paintings of Mills and original prints by one-time Oliver tutor Terry Dowling (b.1946), one of his acknowledged influences. As with other, visually cohesive labels like Factory, Land and ECM, 4AD has asked for and has received from 23 Envelope consistent graphic statements of quality about its special attitude to the music it records and sells.'\n\nTaken from: Edge, Kevin. <u>The Art of Selling Songs : Graphics for the Music Business, 1690-1990</u>.
