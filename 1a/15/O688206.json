They may have been the architect's vision of the offices made to show his intentions to the client or they may have been made later, as a record of the scheme. The fact that another watercolour from the series was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1909, while detailed drawings were being made in 1907, suggests that the latter may have been the case. Whatever the reason for their existence, the fact that Voysey, already well-established as an architect, chose to exhibit one is an indication of the importance he attached to the whole scheme.\n\nThe offices at Capel House are again being refitted. These drawings have been consulted recently by the staff of the Historic Buildings Division of the GLC in order to help them advise on the alterations under consideration.'",
