Following his conversion to  Catholicism in 1835, he identified the Gothic style with Christian architecture and his work and  writings inspired and framed the Gothic Revival. In 'Contrasts', published in 1836, he condemned  classical forms and ardently praised 14th and 15th-century architecture. \nPugin is best remembered for his work on the Palace of Westminster, commonly known as the Houses of Parliament. A new building was constructed from 1840 to replace the former building which had been destroyed by fire in 1834, and Pugin was responsible for much of the interior decoration.",
