The original of 1612-13 was probably made in London. \n\nTime\nFlagons or livery pots were used to distribute the daily allocation (or 'livery' from the French word livre, meaning allocation) of beer to servants, which they received in addition to wages. However, it is unlikely that silver livery pots were made for such a mundane purpose. It is more likely that  they were designed in the latest fashions to grace a buffet of plate, displaying the wealth and status of the owner. The original flagon was probably a diplomatic gift to a tsar of Russia, possibly given in order to gain trading concessions. \n\nMaterials & Making\nThe technique of reproducing objects by electrotyping was first developed by the manufacturing firm of Elkington & Co. of Birmingham in the 1840s. Henry Cole (1808-82), the first director of the South Kensington Museum (now the V&A), was quick to adopt this new technique to reproduce works of art. A plaster mould is made from an original object and used to make a cast in base metal. The model and an amount of plating metal are connected to electric terminals and placed in a container filled with a conductive solution. As it passes through, the electric current causes particles of the plating metal to be deposited on the surface of the model. The thickness of the plating can be regulated by the duration and voltage of the current. The plated object is then worked manually to erase imperfections.",
