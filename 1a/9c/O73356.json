The delicate floral sprays are overprinted in gold, which would have been an less expensive alternative to embroidering the silk.  \n\nThomas Wardle was a leading textile manufacturer and dyer working in Leek, Staffordshire.  He took over his father's dyeworks in the early 1870s, and went on to become one of the leading British textile manufacturers of the late 19th century.  \nWardle was recognised as an expert on the Indian silk industry.  He first visited Bengal in 1885, and he lectured widely on the importance of the tusser (wild) silk of India.  The textured, brown fibres of tusser silk were notoriously resistant to dye, which Wardle successfully overcame in the early 1870s by first bleaching the silk.  He exhibited numerous examples of tusser silk in the silk culture court of the Indian and Colonial Exhibition of 1886 and in the Manchester Jubilee Exhibition of 1887.  The Times reported on the luxurious drapes and divans of Wardle's displays, which sat alongside glass cases filled with the cocoons of silk worms.   He later became a founding member of the Silk Society and was knighted for his contribution to the industry.",
