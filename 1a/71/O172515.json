Their shapes varied widely in different places.  This earring comes from Piedmont, but the use of drop-shaped pendants was common throughout Italy in the 19th century.\n\nIt was bought for \u00a32 4s. as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
