            "bibliography": "<u>Victoria & Albert Museum Department of Prints and Drawings and Department of Paintings, Accessions 1964.</u> London: HMSO, 1965.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows: \n\n\"<b>LANIER (LANI\u00c8RE), Nicholas, I (1568-1646) or II (1588-1666) and VORSTERMAN, Lucas, I (1595-1675) or II (1624-c.1667)</b> \n\nVolume containing plates (43) by Nicholas Lanier I or II and Lucas Vorsterman I or II, after drawings by Parmigianino, Giulio Romano and others, comprising a title-plate, studies of heads and figures, some of which are from drawings formerly in the collection of Thomas Howard, Earl of Arundel, and a title-page and plates (5) after drawings of masks by Giulio Romano in Lanier\u2019s collection.  Impressions on wove paper, probably taken in the early 19th century, quarter-bound in calf, cloth boards, in the form of a Drawings-Book.  (Nagler:Mon. Vol.4, nos.875,1395; Lugt 2885-9, 2991) \n<i>Each signed </i>L <i> or with monogram </i>LV<i> and lettered with name or initials of artist.</i>E.381,392<i> lettered with titles. The volume lettered on the spine</i>Lanier\u2019s Drawing Book 1656\n<i>Etchings and engravings.</i>      E.381-423-1964 \n\n<i>Note:</i> The date on the title-plate (E.381-1964) is equivocal.  The third number lacks a stroke on top, and, at first glance is read as 3, but, as there is more space for a stroke to the right of the number, it might be read as 5. When the volume was acquired by the Library in 1872 the date 1665 was embossed on the spine of the new Library binding.  In addition to this confusion most authorities have read \u2018sessanta otto\u2019 as \u2018settanta otto\u2019. If the artist was the elder Nicholas Lanier who died in 1646, then he was indeed 68 in 1636; however, if the date on the title-page is 1656 and the artist as then 68, his date of birth would have been 1588, corresponding to that of the younger Nicholas Lanier, court musician, painter and collector.\n\nThe date 1638 is generally given for the title-page <i>Maschere</i>\u2026(E.392-1964) but it does not appear on the present impression, and there are no traces of an erasure, though there is space for a date.\n\nEntries in the note books of George Vertue, made at various dates, imply that there were two etchers called Nicholas Lanier, but they are only to be distinguished by different death dates.  The two titles in the present volume are listed with the dates 1636 and 1638 (Vertue 2, p.47);\n\"Nich Laniere or Laneare an Italian, one of the private music to K.C.I and an excellent Painter (who died after. 1648. his picture in the Music School (Oxford.

Many years after)\" (Vertue 2, pp.59,60); \n\"amongst the Arundell Collection of prints\u2026small plates from designs of Italian Masters \u2013 not well grav\u2019d \u2013 nor well etch\u2019d \u2013 are some done by LV Lucas Vosterman small plates from designs \u2013 some marked with L being by N.Laniere \u2013 \" (Vertue 4, p.197) \nA.K. Esdaile in Thieme & Becker, Vol.22, 1928, p.352, proposes that the elder Lanier, who died in 1646, was the etcher of the present plates and was confused in the older literature (Fiorillo, Nagler etc.) with the famous Lanier.  Lugt and the <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i> support this proposal.  It is clearly impossible to decide the question in the present state of our knowledge. \n\n<b>LANIER (LANI\u00c8RE), Nicholas, I (1568-1646) or II (1588-1666) and VORSTERMAN, Lucas, I (1595-1675) or II (1624-c.1667)</b> <i>continued</i> \n\nOpinion is also divided on the authorship of the plates signed with the Vorsterman monogram.  Wurzbach and Le Blanc, under Lucas Vorsterman II, include an unspecified number of plates after Old Master drawings in the collections of Nicholas Lanier.  One of the present plates (E.414) is listed by Hymans as by Lucas I.  Certainly the remainder of the plates E.414, 423 are both ascribed to Lucas II by Copertini (Vol.2, p.61), but there seems to be no evidence that the latter, born in 1624, was working in 1636 at the age of 12; most of his work dates from after 1650.\n\nEarlier impressions of the plates after Parmigianino, except E.382, 383, are mounted in a volume, with a collection of prints after Parmigianino formerly in the collection of Horace Walpole and now in the Department of Prints and Drawings, nos. 29036.1-317. \n \nPlates (7) after the sheet of studies for the figure of Moses on the vaulting of the Steccata, formerly in the collection of the Earl of Arundel, now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.
