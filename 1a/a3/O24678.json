            "public_access_description": "Suzuki Osamu, who made the tea ceremony fresh-water jar, is a leading Mino-based artist specialising in Shino wares. The technology of Shino wares was originally developed in Mino in the late sixteenth century. It was used primarily to produce imitations of imported Chinese porcelain, but it was also harnessed to the making of an important body of tea wares.\nThe discovery that Shino wares were made in Mino rather than Seto is a familiar episode in the history of modern Japanese ceramics. It occurred in 1930 when Arakawa Toyoz\u00f4(1894-1985), recognizing a similarity between the stilt mark on a Shino incense burner shown to him by a Nagoya art dealer and those he had seen on iron-glazed fragments excavated at the Ohira kilns in Mino some years before, started to explore some of the other kiln sites in the area. His suspicions were confirmed when he found Shino shards at Mutabora in the village of Ogaya. Arakawa, who had been running Kitaoji Rosanjin's (1883-1959) kiln in Kamakura since 1927, moved to Mino 1933 and set up a workshop on the site of the old Mtabora kilns. He was a driving force behind the numerous kiln site excavations that were carried out in Mino over the following years. The reputation he established for his Yellow Seto, Black Seto and Shino wares led to his being appointed a Living National Treasure in 1955.\nThe legacy of Arakawa's effort has been such that there are now scores of Mino-based potters who make Momoyama tea ceramics the starting point fir new work. Suzuki, who has been a member of the Japan Crafts Association since 1962, is one of the most successful of these many practitioners. As can be seen in the example of his work shown here, his forms have the dynamism of the best of Momoyama prototypes without being imitative. He also has a formidable ability to manipulate his materials and firing methods to achieve very precise ends. This is the result of many years of experimentation conducted in a strictly scientific manner. Suzuki was appointed a Living National Treasure in 1994.",
