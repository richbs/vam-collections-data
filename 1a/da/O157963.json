These glazed Fassi (from Fez) wares were made by professional male potters as decorative ware for urban consumers. Their style may have been influenced by the appearance of Chinese porcelain, historically made available through Mediterranean trade. Another factor was the availability of increasingly pure cobalt blue imported from Europe from the 1850s onwards.\n\nThis jug or ghorraf was acquired by George Maw, founder of Maw & Co., a British manufacturer of ceramic tiles. Maw initially donated it to the Museum of Practical Geology, Jermyn Street, London but in 1901 most of the Museum\u2019s ceramic holdings were transferred to the South Kensington Museum (later V&A), including this item.",
