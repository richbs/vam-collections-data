The Christ Child is wearing a necklace with what appears to be a piece of coral hanging from it. In the Renaissance coral was thought to afford the wearer of it protection against illness.\n\nThis is the only surviving example of this print. Its comparatively large scale compared to many other fifteeth century prints suggests that it may have been intended to be stuck up on a wall or on a piece of panelling as a focus for Christian devotion by its earliest owners. It is possible that some of the surface losses to this print are the visible traces of this devotional use.",
