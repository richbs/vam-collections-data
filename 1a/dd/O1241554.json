The ballet ,which showed characters from the Prologue of Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales, was created to mark 25 years of the Ballet Rambert. David Paltenghi danced a number of roles, including the Friar.\n\nFrom the 1930s until the 1950s artist Edward Burra (1905-1976) created costumes and settings for the theatre, notably for opera at Covent Garden and for dance works by the Sadler's Wells Ballet and the Ballet Rambert. Reviewing Canterbury Prologue, the Manchester Guardian of 18 October 1951 commented that Burra's 'costume, while seeming artlessly simple in cut and colour, contributes vastly to what pictorial effect there is throughout the ballet.'",
