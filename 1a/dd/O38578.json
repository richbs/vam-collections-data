There is a leather carrying strap attached to the back of the chair, and a circle has been cut in the centre of the fixed seat to hold a child's removable potty.\n[child's potty chair] Matching removable seat, consisting of a trapezoid piece of wood with two recessed finger grips in the front edge, and which fits flat over the potty when the latter is not in use.\n[child's potty chair] Circular potty of white-enamelled tin with a narrow dark blue band around the rim and a dark blue and white looped handle.\n[Child's potty chair] Matching food tray, trapezoid in shape, recessed within its edges, and having wooden arms hinged near the middle to fold flat when not in use; the tray fastens to the chair with two wooden pegs on the inside of each arm.",
