            "history_note": "Gift, received 17 October 1922, from Romolo Piazzani, 20 Half Moon Street, W.\nCondition described as 'cracked and damaged'. A note on the RF dated 13.X.22 says the 'coffer'...'is at Roma's, 13 Exhibition Rd., and may be fetched at any time.' Another note, by C. Baily (20 October 1922) records that 'It is similar in from and decoration to a small casket , no. 569-'90 [Indian, Gujurat or Sindh c1600] in the Museum collection, and appears to be Italian work of the sixteenth century.'\nSee also another chest of the same type: W.46-1935\n\nThis chest is one of about a dozen of the same design and size in public collections that have been published. The appear to have been made during the 17th century, on the basis of their condition and their distinctive embossed iron bands, probably in NE Spain and/or northern Italy. Their rich decoration and raised feet (but plain backs) and suggest that they were intended not only for practical storage but as conspicuous pieces of furnishing, probably standing against an interior wall. In the domed form of their lids and carrying handles, the design deliberately harks back to travelling coffers designed for hard practical use. \n\nIt seems likely, on the basis of the very close similarities between the chests, that they were made in a single centre, presumably with good access to the embossed and punched gilt metal bands that are their most distinctive decorative feature. These bands seem to have been produced in various designs and sizes, both vertical and horizontal, with variations in the embossing and punching \u2013 allowing the makers to \u2018mix and match\u2019 bands on each chest. \n\nIn terms of dating, the basic form and the motifs on the decorative bands are essentially medieval in origin, but their basically sound condition suggests that they are unlikely to predate 1600. The traditional design and showy appearance may indicate that they were made away from high-style, cosmopolitan areas, perhaps over an extended period, and until more is known about the iron bands, a dating 1600-1750 is prudent. Their use of softwood and decorative metal may suggest an origin in the zone between south Germany and northern Italy.",
