From the late 15th century the international trade in beads became increasingly dominated by glass beads produced by manufacturers in Venice, the Netherlands, Bohemia and Moravia. European glassmakers were even able to reproduce forms of bead made of precious and organic materials: stone, crystal, shell and bone.\n\nThis spherical crystal bead was made in the Netherlands in the 18th century. It was given to the Museum in 1904 by Moses Lewin Levin, a London bead merchant who ran an import-export business between 1839 and 1913. The business specialised in European glass beads intended for use in trade in Africa but this crystal bead suggests it also kept examples of older, more valuable forms of bead.",
