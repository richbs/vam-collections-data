            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nAnkle boots were introduced in about 1804 for women's fashionable wear. They were sometimes decorated with silk rosettes, particularly for special occasions such as weddings. The fashion for square toes lasted from 1825 to the 1870s.  These boots have thin flat soles but heels were coming back in to fashion for ladies footwear.\n\nOwnership & Use\nThese boots and a wedding dress and veil also in the museum's collection (T.43&A-1947) were worn by Eliza Penelope Clay at her marriage to Joseph Bright at St James's Church, Piccadilly, London on 16th February 1865. White boots were also worn for more everyday wear. They were often made of soft kid or silk satin.  The Lady's Magazine in 1858 referred to 'elastic-sided boots for daywear and evening shoes with or without small heels and rosettes'.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe elastic inner side gussets on these boots eliminated the need for laces and button fastenings.  The elastic-sided boot was patented by J. Sparkes-Hall of No. 308 Regent Street in 1837 as a result of experiments made with india rubber cloth.  By 1850 techniques for making elastic gussets had much improved although the elastic still tended to perish. Each boot also has a cork insole inserted inside probably to help keep out the damp.  One of the insoles is inscribed: 'Superior Quality Cork Soles'.\n\nPeople\nJ. Sparkes Hall presented his prototypes for elastic-sided boots to Queen Victoria.  In his prospectus he claimed that she 'walks in them daily and thus gives the strongest proof of the value she attaches to the invention'.",
