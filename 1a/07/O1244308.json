In the early 1950s, Barnor set up Ever Young studio in Accra\u2019s Jamestown district where he took photographs of the local community at key stages in their lives. Although intended as personal mementos, the Ever Young photographs also recorded the changes occurring in Ghanaian society in this period. \n\nBarnor\u2019s photograph of the young policewoman Selina Opong reflects the sense of civic pride and the new ambitions of urban professionals as Ghana looked to independence. Titled as \u2018Policewoman #10\u2019, Selina Opong was the tenth female police officer to graduate from the newly established police academy in Accra. In 1957, Ghana became the first nation in Sub-Saharan Africa to gain independence from the British Empire.\n\nThe V&amp;A acquired five photographs by James Barnor as part of the Staying Power project. Staying Power is a five year partnership between the V&amp;A and Black Cultural Archives. The project aims to explore black British experience from the 1950s to the 1990s through photographs acquired by the V&amp;A and oral histories conducted by Black Cultural Archives.",
