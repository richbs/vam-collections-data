There are branches and leaves suggestive of trees on either side and hills, a river and a bridge are visible in the distance. Two groups of men and women stand on either side. The men wear loose shirts, knee length breeches and front buttoning jackets whilst their female companions wear simple full skirted dresses. They are watching a central trio of two women in matching full skirted dresses with cap sleeved blouses gathered in to a wide dark waistband and with strips of dark material, alternating with strips of white. Both are dancing with arms upraised with a man, in a similar loose shirt, breeches and open jacket, who is leaping in to the air.",
