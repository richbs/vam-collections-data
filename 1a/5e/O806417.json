Volume I. 14th-16th century</u>, London, 1979, p.38-39 The following is the full text of the entry: BEDOLI, GIROLAMO <i>self-styled</i> Girolamo Mazzo!a (c. 1500-69) 45 Design for the decoration of a lunette in Parma Cathedral Inscribed 'Zuccaro' Black chalk and pen and ink and wash on blue paper 8 7/8 x 12 3/4 (225 x 325) 8629 PROVENANCE J. B. Skippe (Lugt, <i>Supplement</i> 1529); bought 1880 LITERATURE A. E. Popham and Mario di Giampaolo, Exhibition Catalogue, <i>Disegni di Girolamo Bedoli</i>, Viadana, 1971, pp. 60-1, no. 50; pl. 50 Among the lunettes painted by Bedoli and his assistants below the vaulting of Parma Cathedral between 1555 and 1557 there is one (the last on the left looking towards the altar), as Philip Pouncey first observed, that shows the same composition as this drawing (illustrated in the catalogue quoted pl. 48). The drawing is a design for the lunette and appears to be by Bedoli. But the history of these fresco decorations is not yet clearly established. Copertini in his article on Bedoli in <i>Parma per l'arte</i>, 9, fasc. 1, 1959, p. 8, states that the documents give us no information on the authorship of the lunettes. Some were painted by Lattanzio Gambara (1568-73), and Pouncey has recognised a study for a figure in one of them in a drawing by Gambara in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford (Parker, <i>Ashmolean Catalogue</i>, no. 240; pl. 60). Our drawing was formerly ascribed to 'Zuccaro'.",
