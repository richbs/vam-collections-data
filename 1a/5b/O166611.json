In doing so, he laid the foundations of modern photography. Calvert Richard Jones learned of these developments in 1839 through a neighbour, who was a cousin of Talbot. Jones made many pictures in the West of England and South Wales, where he lived. He also travelled widely, making photographs on the continent. Jones' work stands out in the early development of photography because he was one of the first to apply a schooled artist's eye to the medium. \n\nThis early two-part panorama is of Rheola House, South Wales nestling into the surrounding hills . The composition is similar to an earlier pencil and ink study made by Jones in 1836. Like his drawing, Jones has included groups of figures in front of the house, although the arrangements are less successful in the photographic version. The single seated figure in this half of the panorama may be Jones himself.",
