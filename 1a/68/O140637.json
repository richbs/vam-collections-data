            "public_access_description": "This cup was commissioned by Mrs G.L. Grant (known as 'Michael') to celebrate the love of Africa which she shared with her first husband, Commander John Hinton Carrow CMG, DSC (1890-1973).  Commander Carrow entered the Royal Navy in 1905 and fought at Jutland. He was invalided out of the Royal Navy and served from 1919 to 1947 in Nigeria in the Colonial Administrative Service.\n\n'Michael' Grant (she took her second husband's surname) coxed the Oxford University women's boat, and went as a postgraduate to Africa, where she had a pet lion.  She enjoyed Louis Osman's sense of fun and his highly individual approach to goldsmithing.  She used to say that the cup was in a sense unfinished because pressure from his creditors meant that he executed the final decoration of the drum rapidly so that she could leave by the back door while the bailiffs came in through the front.  Louis Osman's design for a more elaborate version of the cup is in the collection of the V&A's Word and Image Department (E.328-1985).\n\nLouis Osman was born in Exeter in 1914.  He studied drawing at the Slade School of Art and trained at the Bartlett School of Architecture.  In 1940 he married Dilys Roberts who executed the enamelling on this cup.   He practised as an architect and then, partly at the instigation of Gerald Benney, as a silversmith.  He designed the  gold crown for the investiture of the Prince of Wales in 1969 and many commissions for the Goldsmiths' Company's collection.  He died in 1996.",
