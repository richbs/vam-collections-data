            "public_access_description": "From around 1640, light swords with short, flexible, pointed blades appeared in response to new fencing techniques that emphasised thrusting at speed. They were worn increasingly with civilian clothes as 'small swords', offering a means of self-defence but largely denoting status for the well-dressed gentleman.\n\nSmall swords were items of male jewellery. By the 1750s, their elaborate gold and silver hilts, mounted with precious stones and fine enamelling, were the products of the goldsmith and jeweller rather than the swordsmith. They made fitting rewards for distinguished military and naval service. With their blades tucked away inside scabbards, it was their ostentatious and expensive hilts that carried their thrust.\n\nThis gold hilted sword is decorated with the arms of Sir Rowland Hill (1772-1842) and the arms of the City of London and is inscribed: 'PRESENTED by the Corporation of the City of London pursuant to a Vote of the Common Council passed the 12th July 1813. The Right Honble George Scholey Mayor To LIEUT GENL SR ROWLAND HILL KB In testimony of the high Sense this Court entertains for his public services in the Skill Bravery and exertions so eminently displayed on the 21st day of June last When the French Army was compleatly defeated AT VITTORIA by the Allied Forces under the Command of Field Marshall the Marquis of Wellington'.\n\nThe sword was made by John Ray and James Montague, the esteemed hilt-makers, goldworkers and enamellers who succeeded James Morisset at Denmark Street, Soho, in around 1800. They thrived during the Napoleonic wars due to the prevalence of presentations swords as rewards for service, but lost business following Waterloo, when the demand for such items declined.",

The Right Honble George Scholey Mayor To LIEUT GENL SR ROWLAND HILL KB In testimony of the high Sense this Court entertains for his public services in the Skill Bravery and exertions so eminently displayed on the 21st day of June last When the French Army was compleatly defeated AT VITTORIA by the Allied Forces under the Command of Field Marshall the Marquis of Wellington'\n\nThe sword was made by John Ray and James Montague, the esteemed hilt-makers, goldworkers and enamellers who succeeded James Morisset at Denmark Street, Soho, in around 1800. They thrived during the Napoleonic wars due to the prevalence of presentations swords as rewards for service, but lost business following Waterloo, when the demand for such items declined.\n\nThe Museum bought this sword in 1963 from the Royal United Services Institute Museum for \u00a3450 (RUSI Ref: 7867). \n\nThe sword was described in the RUSI catalogue as a \"dress rapier\". It was one of a number of items associated with Rowland Hill given to RUSI by Caroline, the Viscountess Hill, wife of the 5th Viscount Hill. He died without issue in 1924, so the items were donated to RUSI after 1924, and before the Viscountess died in 1941. (Information supplied by Cliff Thornton, 14/04/2013)",

They were worn increasingly with civilian clothes as 'small swords', offering a means of self-defence but largely denoting status for the well-dressed gentleman.\n\nSmall swords were items of male jewellery. By the 1750s, their elaborate gold and silver hilts, mounted with precious stones and fine enamelling, were the products of the goldsmith and jeweller rather than the swordsmith. They made fitting rewards for distinguished military and naval service. With their blades tucked away inside scabbards, it was their ostentatious and expensive hilts that carried their thrust.",
