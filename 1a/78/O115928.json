To  both sides of the tree an arabesque of white stems bears a profusion of large composite blossoms, serrated leaves and a boteh-shaped leaf.\n\nb)  the lower field has a large, dark blue boteh curling inwards from both lower corners.  Flower, leaf and bird-bearing stems emerge from the botehs to frame, in the lower centre, a red human face encircled by a white, indented coronet outlined in blue (the motif described earlier as a 'solar disk').\n\nc)  field borders:  1) on both sides of the slit and extending to form a crescent is a border with a dark blue ground; on it a sequence of linked floral sprigs each with a pair of dark blue leaves and a red and light brown flower all face outwards from bottom centre.\n\n2)  along the left and right edge of the field is a narrow floral meander on a dark blue vine with no guard stripe.\n\nMain border:  yellow ground with a dark blue meander linking dark red, red and blue flowers and light green leaves.\n\nInner and outer border:  both have the border of the field slit (c.1) with orange and white flowers and light green leaves on a dark blue ground.  On both the lower and upper border the design fces outwards from a central point.",
