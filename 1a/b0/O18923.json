Mr Lindskog's mother kept the spectacles when he outgrew them and added the handwritten note.\n[Spectacles] Reinforced/ safety glass was first produced by inserting a lamina between two sheets of ordinary glass, the layers being held together by use of an adhesive cement between them.  Early brand names included Triplex, Salvoc and Safetex, which varied in the substance used for the lamina (including cellulose acetate and xylonite) and in the mounting method.  Experiments were made with inset cement lenses for use as bifocals as early as 1813, and they were successfully commercially produced in approximately 1884.  The cement used in ophthalmic products was often Canada balsam, which tends to discolour with age and exposure to daylight.",
