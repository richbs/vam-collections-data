By the mid 17th century two-handled cups ranged from the most elaborate ceremonial items to everyday drinking vessels. Modest examples such as this were made in large quantities in the 1650s.\n\nDecoration\nThe cup is decorated in a variety of techniques that provide a contrast between decorative and burnished surfaces. The matted surfaces, found within the roundels, and the beading at the border were much used at this period, as was punching. The scrolled handles bear caryatids (female figures, often used as columns) a remnant of the English Renaissance style.",
