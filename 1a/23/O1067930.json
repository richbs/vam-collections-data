Full citation:\n\n\"<b> 45 Unknown Woman</b> \n<b>c.1628-30</b> \nP95-1937  \n \n<b>Oval 44 x 35mm</b>  \n \nFeatures in softly hatched and blended brown and sanguine, with some light grey in the shadows, black in the eyes and white for the lights, on a very pale carnation ground; hair in brown wash with ochre lights and touches of grey; collar in thin white wash, modelled in grey and thick white; hat in black wash, modelled in opaque grey; 'gold' decoration in ochre, pale yellow and white; background in brown wash, with darker colour lightening towards the top; on vellum put down on pasteboard.  \n \n<b>Condition:</b> Faded, especially in the sanguine; minor abrasions in face and ruff, discreetly retouched; some flaking in the margins, especially lower right; apparently cropped.  \n \n<b>Signed:</b> Lower centre right: <i>DDG</i>.  \n \n<b>Frame:</b> Nineteenth-century oval copper-gilt locket, slightly convex back overlapping and soldered to the underside of the rounded arris of the otherwise straight sides; 1 the convex bevelled glass held in a bezel at the front; the hanger of D-section, channelled down the middle and with separate diminishing spirals of flattened wire in three turns on each side.  \n \n<b>Provenance:</b> Miss A E Holland of Lincoln, from whom purchased by private treaty, 1937, with funds from the R H Stephenson Bequest.  \n \n<b>Literature:</b> Accessions 1937, p. 82; V&A, Review of the Principal Acquisitions, 1937, p. 33, p. 15b (,shows some affinity with the style of Iohn Hoskins\"): Reynolds 1952, p. 70 ('a signed miniature in the Victoria & Albert Museum, shows a woman in the costume of not later than 1630'); Foskett 1979, p.120; <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p.15\n. \nThe miniature had not been closely examined at the time of Murdoch 1981 (see Cat. No. 44 [P.5-1950]) but it is largely consistent with the characteristics of Des Granges' early style discussed there, especially in relation to the soft grey wash across the face, stippled softly into the shadows. In the use of non-metallic paint to represent gold in the ear-rings, the style suggests also a firm tendency away from the lingering influence of Hilliard, evident for example in Cat. No. 46. There is even the sense of some gravitational pull toward Alexander Cooper in the use of the flat dark background, lightening towards the top. Although Des Granges' signed work became very eclectic in the 163 Os, miniatures such as this appear to represent what was distinctive about his vision and remained relatively constant to the end of his career.  \n \nBy the late 1620s it was becoming increasingly rare for young sitters to be shown in miniatures wearing a hat. The floppy dark hat is often indicative of Melancholy and its associated, primarily masculine, qualities, such as withdrawal from society, wisdom and creativity. Compare the slightly later Samuel Cooper portrait of Van Dyck's mistress, Margaret Lemon, (2) often referred to as being in male costume. As in the Margaret Lemon, the sitter here is in outdoor clothes. She would have worn a tailored doublet, the collar of which would have supported her falling ruff high under the jaw-line. The 'masculinity' of the cut of such garments is associated with the dominance of male tailors in the production of women's outdoor clothing rather than with an overt fashion for 'crossdressing' .The androgynous effect was, nonetheless, both intentional and noticed.(3)\n\n1  This is a crude variant of the familiar nineteenth-century construction, in which the back overlaps the line of the sides. \n2  Institut Neerlandais, Lugt Collection; Murdoch 1981, p. 105, fig. 121.
