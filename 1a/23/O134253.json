The were so popular that they held daily receptions at the circus, and people flocked in hundreds to gaze upon and fondle them.\n\nThe Royal Circus opened in 1782, built by Charles Hughes and Thomas Dibdin on land previously occupied by a riding school. Dibdin's new theatre combined the stage of the traditional theatre with the newly-popular circus ring so that his spectacles could unite aspects of the stage and the ring.  The Royal Circus burnt down and was rebuilt twice between 1782 and 1810 when it became the Surrey Theatre.",
