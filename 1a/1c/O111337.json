This watch has a finely-made movement and a superbly engraved dial which reflect the high quality of watchmaking in Blois in the seventeenth-century.  Blois makers received royal patronage and rivalled Paris in the quality of the movements, the engraving and the enamelling.  \n\nNicolas I Lemaindre was watch and clockmaker (horloger) of the queen mother, Marie de M\u00e9dici, widow of Henri IV, who was at one point exiled to Blois.  He died in 1652-3.  His nephew Nicolas II Lemaindre was watch and clockmaker to the brother of Louis XIII, Duke Gaston d'Orl\u00e9ans, to whom the ch\u00e2teau of Blois was granted.  Nicholas II also made fine watches in the second quarter of the seventeenth century.",
