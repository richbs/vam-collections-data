London: Oxford University Press, 1946-49. Vol 1: London and Middlesex, Surrey, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire. p.187.\n\u2018Of all the counties close to the metropolis, Hertfordshire is the least exploited, the least publicized, the quietest.  For this reason, its recording was considered less urgent, and was effected less fully, than its neighbours\u2019.\n\nThe two main threats to its peace are the colony of cinematic studios near Elstree and the Great Cambridge Road.  Elstree, which falls well within the boundaries of a good map of London, was past its best \u2013 some way past \u2013 before the film magnates found it.  The Cambridge Road, on the other hand, following the Roman Ermine Street, runs through the length of the county and traverses some of its pleasantest scenery, and along or beside it most of the recording was done \u2013 at Ware, Wadesmill, High Cross, Much Hadham, Standon, Puckeridge, Braughing, and Westmill.  The ribbon development that so obstinately results from the widening of arterial ways is not yet here so pronounced as on some of the other main routes radiating from London; but there is always the marked tendency for highway villages, once separate and removed, to approach, merge, and lose their individuality.  Sometimes, after the construction of a by-pass, a few old villages will drop (the hectic days behind them) back into cruising speed, while others are rudely accelerated, knocked up, beaten up in their stead.  They never know what a year may bring.\u2019",

            "history_note": "This work is from the 'Recording Britain' collection of topographical watercolours and drawings made in the early 1940s during the Second World War. In 1940 the Committee for the Employment of Artists in Wartime, part of the Ministry of Labour and National Service, launched a scheme to employ artists to record the home front in Britain, funded by a grant from the Pilgrim Trust. It ran until 1943 and some of the country's finest watercolour painters, such as John Piper, Sir William Russell Flint and Rowland Hilder, were commissioned to make paintings and drawings of buildings, scenes, and places which captured a sense of national identity. Their subjects were typically English: market towns and villages, churches and country estates, rural landscapes and industries, rivers and wild places, monuments and ruins. Northern Ireland was not covered, only four Welsh counties were included, and a separate scheme ran in Scotland.\n\nThe scheme was known as 'Recording the changing face of Britain' and was established by Sir Kenneth Clark, then the director of the National Gallery. It ran alongside the official War Artists' Scheme, which he also initiated. Clark was inspired by several motives: at the outbreak of war in 1939, there was a concern to document the British landscape in the face of the imminent threat of bomb damage, invasion, and loss caused by the operations of war. This was allied to an anxiety about changes to the landscape already underway, such as the rapid growth of cities, road building and housing developments, the decline of rural ways of life and industries, and new agricultural practices, which together contributed to the idea of a 'vanishing Britain'. Clark also wanted to help artists, and the traditional forms of British art such as watercolour painting, to survive during the uncertain conditions of wartime. He in turn was inspired by America's Federal Arts Project which was designed to give artists employment during the Great Depression of the 1930s.\n\nOver 1500 works were eventually produced by 97 artists, of whom 63 were specially commissioned. At the time the collection had a propaganda role, intended to boost national morale by celebrating Britain's landscapes and heritage. Three exhibitions were held during the war at the National Gallery, and pictures from the collection were sent on touring exhibitions and to galleries all around the country. After the war, the whole collection was given to the V&A by the Pilgrim Trust in 1949, and it was documented in a four volume catalogue published between 1946 and 1949. For many years the majority of the collection was on loan to councils and record offices in each county, until recalled by the V&A around 1990. The pictures now form a memorial to the war effort, and a unique record of their time.",
