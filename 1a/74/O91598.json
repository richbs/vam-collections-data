This cup of 1717 is identified by an inscription as the Wilkomm of the Hanover Brotherhood. This primarily financial association, founded in 1616, provided free funerals for its members and their families. Unsurprisingly new members had to be under 40, in good health and of 'blameless character'. Paupers and soldiers were excluded. The inscriptions on the cup and on the pendant shields all refer in some way to death.",
