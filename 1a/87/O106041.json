When Alicia Markova danced in the ballet in 1950, she decided also to appear at the end of Act I as the Snow Queen, giving her a more substantial role in the production. The costume is a perfect evocation of a snow fairy - the pale blue tarlatan and net set off with silver lam\u00e9 decoration, and the diamant\u00e9 crown set on a wig of opalescent cellophane. The wig was the brainchild of the legendary Stanley Hall of Wig Creations, and was the first ever made of cellophane.  Under the lights the whole costume suggested cold and frost.\n   \nAlicia Markova achieved fame while still a teenager with the Diaghilev Ballets Russes and, after Diaghilev's death in 1929, danced with the embryo British companies, Ballet Rambert and the Vic-Wells (now The Royal) Ballet. With the latter, she achieved ballerina status, dancing the major classical roles in Swan Lake, Giselle and Casse-Noisette.  After Anna Pavlova died in 1931, Markova commissioned all her tutus from Pavlova's costume maker, Mme Manya (Manya Charchevnikova).",
