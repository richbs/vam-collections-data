The posters would be overpasted with details and dates. This one was produced for the \u2018Queen of the Music Hall\u2019 Marie Lloyd (1870-1922) whose career spanned 40 years.\n\nMarie Lloyd first appeared at the Eagle Tavern in London aged 15 as Bella Delmare, singing \u2018My Soldier Laddie\u2019. By 1885 she had become Marie Lloyd with her hit song \u2018The Boy I Love is Up in the Gallery\u2019. She was a huge success and topped the bill at the West End music halls. Her songs were full of innuendo and double meaning. \u2018She\u2019d never had her ticket punched before\u2019 and \u2018Oh Mr Porter what shall I do?\u2019 appeared innocent on first reading but took on a very saucy interpretation when performed by Miss Lloyd.",
