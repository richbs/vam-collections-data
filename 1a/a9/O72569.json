[Presumably acquired from Cooper's estate by the Rosses, or perhaps by Priestman (see Rosse, Cat.  No. 143) and perhaps in the Michael Rosse sale, 2 April 1723; eventually purchased by Edwin [Durning] Lawrence  before 1862, and sold by him to the Museum for \u00a3525 in 1892.]\n\n<b>Exhibited:</b> As for Cat.

She was the daughter of Barbara (Villiers), Countess of Castlemaine and Duchess of Cleveland. Her paternity, which was claimed by her mother's husband Roger Palmer (son of Sir lames Palmer, q.v.), was acknowledged by the King by Royal Warrant in 1673, in the teeth of gossip which attributed the child nevertheless to Philip Stanhope, 3rd Earl of Chesterfield (1634-1713/14), whom she was said to resemble strongly. \n\nOn coiffure, and on what can be seen of the costume, the portrait dates from the early1680s, as observed by Reynolds (197 5).The inscription, which may therefore be later, could not referto Anne (Palmer 1 Fitzroy ) before 5 October 1684, when Thomas Lennard, Baron Dacre (1653-1715), who had married Anne in 1674 when she was twelve, was created Earl of Sussex. Until 1680, the title Countess of Sussex was borne by the widow of lames Savile, 2nd Earl of Sussex (1647-1 671), of the previous creation. Her name was also Anne (born Wake, the daughter of an Antwerp merchant), and she died in June 1680. She could just about have been the sitter for this miniature. \n\nA portrait also described as The Countess of Sussex was no. 190 on the fourth day of the Rosse sale. (1) If this was of the same sitter as the present miniature, the sitter must be Anne (Palmer /Fitzroy) . At the date of the sale in 1723, she had only recently died; there was no one else entitled to call herself Countess of Sussex until Talbot Yelverton, 1st Earl of the next creation, married Lucy Pelham in 1726. \n\n1 Foskett 1974, p.104.\"\n\n",
