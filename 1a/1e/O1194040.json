            "public_access_description": "This doll, called 'Petalskin' was manufactured by Palitoy in the 1960s. Palitoy was first founded in 1919 as the Cascelloid Company by A. E. Pallet. The company, based in Leicester, manufactured celluloid and plastic fancy goods, including toys. The company made many varied dolls after the introduction of vinyl materials including Tressy in 1964 and in the same year, Tiny Tears. They were also the first company to introduce sleeping eyes into vinyl dolls, as can be seen in this example, using new methods of production and design patented in 1941. This particular doll is aimed at a younger audience than some of Palitoy's other dolls, as emphasised by the photographs on the packaging and the accessories that the doll has.",
