The theatre club was started in 1979 by the American director and writer Lou Stein in a room above the Prince Albert Pub in Pembridge Road. Dedicated to producing the best works of foreign writers, by 1981 the Gate established itself as one of London's best fringe venues, along with the King's Head and the Bush. In 1982 the club expanded to include a brand-new custom-built studio theatre above the Latchmere Pub in Battersea.\n\nMikhail Bulgakov was a Russian playwright and novelist who wrote plays for the Moscow Art Theatre in the 1920s but whose work was later banned by the authorities for being anti-Soviet. He wrote the black comedy Moli\u00e8re in 1930 in protest against State censorship of his plays, seeing parallels between his situation and that of the French playwright  who was both loaded with honours by Louis IX yet also punished by the Church for perceived atheism in Tartuffe.",
