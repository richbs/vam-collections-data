The most sought after makers were S\u00e9bastien Erard (1752 - 1831), Georges Cousineau (1733 - about 1800), and Jean-Henri Naderman (1735-99), who may have made this instrument. All three of them worked closely with Jean Baptiste Krumpholtz (1742 - 1790), perhaps the greatest harpist of his day, to develop instruments. This harp is unsigned and has no date, but it is fitted with crochettes or right-angled hooks, operated by foot-pedals, which raised the pitch of each string by one semi-tone, a popular device during this period.",
