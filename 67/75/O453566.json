It produces cotton, wheat, corn, fruits (especially pomegranates, pears and apricots), and walnuts, with sheep grazing in the highlands. It is made up of several ethnic minorities such as the Kirgizs and the Ozbeks. Their material lives are still closely related to animal husbandry, with their garments, food and dwellings all distinctively feature nomadism. Kirgiz women are known to wear brightly coloured and highly decorated dresses of bright reds and greens and extravagantly embroidered high boots. The Kirgizs like bright red known to signify good luck, prosperity and love, as well as any bright colours such as whites and blues. As clothing is particularly important in the their semi-nomadic lifestyle, among the Kirgiz handicrafts embroidery and knitting are the most noteworthy, resulting in a highly embroidered and brightly-coloured decorative arts that is similarly brightly-coloured and full of vitality. \n\nhttp://www.ccnpic.com/English/picture_content.html?id=1035\n\nhttp://www.drben.net/ChinaReport/Sources/Art_Arts_Culture/Ethnic_Minorities_in_China/Islamic/Kirgiz/Kirgiz_Kyrgyz-Ethnic_Minority.html",
