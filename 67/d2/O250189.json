The arms, however, have to be interpreted as those of Queen Mary, or possibly even those of William and Mary (these were not clearly established at the time of their coronation in 1689). A number of glasses of this type - which are of lead glass, with multi-knopped stems, and with wheel engraving in the Dutch manner - have the arms of William and Mary, rulers of both England and the Northern Nethelands, but several have exclusively Dutch subject matter or inscriptions, and the manufacture and decoration of the whole group is now attributed to the Netherlands.",
