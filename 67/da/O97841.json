            "public_access_description": "The serving of the fashionable hot drinks tea, coffee and chocolate was often the focal point of domestic social rituals in the eighteenth-century. Porcelain tea and coffee sets with matching trays (d\u00e9jeuners) were made for one or two persons to serve themselves in private apartments. The design and elaboration of the decoration of the sets signalled their owner\u2019s taste and wealth. \n\nTea and coffee were not served together at the same time, so the same saucers were often used with both tea and coffee cups. The design of tea cups evolved as the eighteenth century progressed, but tea cups were generally lower and more open in shape than coffee cups. However, it is clear from the records at S\u00e8vres that in France at least certain shapes could be used interchangeably for coffee or tea.\n\nThis is one of a small number of tea and coffee sets very finely decorated with scenes from Goethe's hugely successful novel The Sorrows of Young Werther first published in 1774.  It was made at the Meissen porcelain factory in 1789. All the known services have the same vessel shapes, and certain of the components are painted with the same subjects and scenes. Some of this decoration is after preliminary design drawings by Johann David Schubert (1761-1822), who worked as teacher of drawing at the factory's drawing school from 1786 and who became principal painter at the factory in 1795, and some of Schubert's designs were in turn copied from prints.",

This saucer is catalogue no. 7.10, p. 108 (see also p. 5). Lotte is shown playing the piano joyfully. The lovesick Werther meanwhile sits nearby, leaning on the piano, listening and looking down at her hands, while one of her little sisters stands leaning against his legs, holding a doll. The source for this scene is a French print, engraved by Morange after S. Amand. One coloured version in the collection of the Goethe Museum in Dusseldorf is catalogue no. 18, p. 127, illustrated p. 128 A different coloured version (reversed), engraved by F.
