The skirt, which is gathered at the back, has been whip stitched to the high-waisted bodice, but may originally have been separate or partly separated; there is a slit in the skirt front below the right edge of the bodice to give access to a pocket worn beneath the dress.  The garment fastens at the back with drawstrings of white tape at neck and waist.",

It is a rare example of everyday wear for early 19th-century girls. The \u2018best\u2019 dresses of the time, of embroidered muslin, survive in much greater numbers. The slit in the skirt at waist level was to give access to the child\u2019s pocket. This pouch, usually of linen or cotton, was worn, like that of an adult woman, on a tape about the waist, beneath the dress. This is the item mentioned in the traditional rhyme \u2018Lucy Locket lost her pocket\u2019.",
