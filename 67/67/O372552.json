They are often linked by a chain.  Sometimes this chain hung under the chin, but other kinds were strung over the head, to support the earrings, or hooked into the head scarf at the back of the head, as here.  The little bird, with a sharp hook on the back, is also typical of Balkan jewellery of all kinds.  These earrings have sharp ends to the wire, and were probably worn in the ear, but larger, heavier versions were often worn as ear ornaments, hooked into the headdress at either side of the face.\n\nThey were bought for 13 shillings (the pair) at the International Exhibition, London, 1872.",
