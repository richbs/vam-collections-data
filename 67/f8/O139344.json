In 1839 William Henry Fox Talbot invented a way of making paper negatives, the photographer of this scene, Calvert Jones, a member of Talbot's circle, used the process to take this photograph.\n\nJones was interested in the old architecture of Bristol and several of the shops in this street are in timber-framed buildings which overhang the pavement. During the 1840s, these 17th century buildings were considered very old-fashioned and were being replaced by new Victorian development. The end of the street and some parts of the sunny side of the street look rather foggy or blurred, this is because there were people in the street and they were moving too quickly to be captured by the camera.",

F Talbot's photographic discoveries in the late 1830s through Talbot's friends and relations who lived near to Jones in South Wales. Jones subsequently became one of the few Britons to produced a substantial body of calotypes in Britain and abroad. His work stands out in the early development of photography because of his ability to fuse his technical skill with his training as a watercolorist. \n\nMany of Jones' photographs made in Bristol focus on the architecture of an earlier time. At the end of this street of shops, and in the foreground, timber-framed buildings overhang the pavements; at the time these 17th century buildings were regarded as very old-fashioned. Goods were often hung outside the shops and there is evidence of this on both sides of the street",

The step ladders at the end of the street are probably being used for hanging out shop wares. The street is Mary-le-Port Street in the heart of old Bristol. In <u>Mathew's Directory -1846</u> several Bacon Factors are listed.in Mary-le-Port Street. In the background on the left hangs a giant watering can, which may advertise the premises of  J & W Parnell, ironmongers in Mary-le-Port Street. A watercolour in Bristol City Museum and Galley shows the same view.",
