The painting obliterates much of the original printed design and only the central panel follows the printed image. The central panel shows an armed man (thought to be Prince Charles Edward Stuart 'Bonnie Prince Charlie') supported by Mars and Minerva. At his side is an altar blazing with devoted hearts. To either side are smaller compartments with trophies, classical ladies and Neoclassical decoration. The decoration surrounding the central panel is loosely based on the style of classical Roman wall paintings. The sticks are finely carved and pierced with Neoclassical decoration. Screw-type rivet. The fan is possibly a Jacobite fan.",

The only part of the original engraved design that has been retained is the central panel showing a man in mid-18th century armour accompanied by the classical Gods Mars and Minerva. \n\nThe man is probably Prince Charles Edward Stuart (1720-1788) who led the unsuccessful Jacobite rebellion of 1745. At his side there is an altar blazing with devoted hearts. Another copy of the engraved fan is known in the West Highland Museum, Fort William. Fans such as this were said to have been distributed by the Prince to ladies at a ball at Holyrood House in Edinburgh, held to celebrate his victory at the Battle of Prestonpans. A fan like this was a symbol of support for the Jacobite cause and a potentially dangerous possession. \n\nThe over-painting tones down the imagery of the engraving which showed the god Jupiter destroying the Hanovarian faction together with allegories of Rapine and Murder. The decorative panels that replace these scenes echo ancient Roman wall paintings.",
