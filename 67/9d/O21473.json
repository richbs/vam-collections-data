The birds and flying insects that appear in the decoration were popular motifs used widely on all types of delftware (tin-glazed earthenware). Contemporary bird feeders were, in fact, quite different. Instead, this object seems to have been made to hold a night light. Its enclosed shape provides some protection from draughts and the windows allow the light to radiate. The open top, meanwhile, provides easy access and allows the heat of the flame to dissipate.\n\nManufacturers\nThe pottery in Lambeth High Street was one of a number of delftware factories in operation in London during the mid-18th century. Its founder, Henry Hodgson, acquired a lease on the premises shortly before his death in 1732. He also arranged for the advancement of a sum of money so that his son (of the same name) and nephew, Henry Foster, could establish a pottery business there. The factory was later acquired by William Griffith, who on his death in 1761 was described by the trades newspaper, The Public Ledger, as 'the most considerable potter in England'. His widow Abigail ran the pottery after his death.",
