Another similar butterfly flies above the plant.  Two small leafy plants sprout along the lower edge at either side.  The painting has been extended and a further three leafy plants added along with a brown and green washed ground.  The main plant is painted directly onto the plain off-white ground of the paper.  The flowers and buds are painted orange with the detailing produced by hatched lines in red.  The leaves are treated in the same manner with a pale green ground over which outlines and veining are hatched in with a darker tone.  \n      The painting is framed with strips of grey paper outlined with black ruled lines and laid on the plain ivory-coloured main border.  This is edged with strips of buff-coloured paper and two inner black ruled lines.  The right hand side has a strip of beige woven textile stuck along its length to act as a gutter for the album binding. Th edges of the page have been gilded.",
