The front shows three anthropomorphic animals: a puppy in a checked shirt riding on the engine of a toy train, a puppy in a spotted top watching from the top of a tunnel, and a mouse in a striped shirt with a whistle and flag; the wording reads \nNOW YOU ARE 4  HAPPY  BIRTHDAY\nwith the large figure four embossed with toys and flowers and printed in gold coloured ink.  The puppy on the engine becomes a pop-up figure when the card is opened, with the mouse operating the signal; the verse reads:\nALL ABOARD !\nWe're on our way !\nTo greet you on this Special Day,\nThe  Birthday Train comes steaming through\nBringing my greetings just for you,\nMay your Birthday be just fine\nWith gladness all along the line.",
