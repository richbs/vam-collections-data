It is  fitted with metal strings on both sides and was widely used in Germany and the Netherlands from about 1650 until 1750. The player would set it on a table, pluck the melody with his right hand and strum the accompaniment with his left. It would no doubt have sounded like a cross between a harpsichord and a harp. This instrument is decorated with flowers, like the soundboards of harspichords made in the Netherlands and England, during the 17th century.",
