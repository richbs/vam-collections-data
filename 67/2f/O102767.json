            "public_access_description": "Harley Granville Barker's production of Twelfth Night in 1912 was one of a trio of his  productions that helped revolutionise attitudes to Shakespearean production and design in the early 20th centuy.  The bright colours and relative simplicity of the designs by Norman Wilkinson were in complete contrast to the detailed, often cumbersome productions that were the legacy of 19th century realism.  \nThe costume is of great extravagance.  This fits in with Viola being the embassy of a rich lord paying court to his beloved.  It required 5 5/6 yards of a magnificent silver and white brocade which cost \u00a311.13s.4d (about \u00a3830 at 2008 prices), plus the cost of the superb brilliant pink lining.  The total cost of the production was \u00a3619.7s.1d (about \u00a345,000 at 2008 prices).  \nThe effect of this coat over Viola's black and green doublet and breeches (see S.1356-1984) must have been spectacular to an audience used to the genteel tones of most Edwardian fashion.  The severe simplicity was also in contrast to the frills and froth of many dresses of the period.",
