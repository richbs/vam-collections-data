One or more of these elements features on each page; sticks in a charcoal and pastel drawing entitled 'Sunlight filters through the arc of branches', sticks and stones in a pen and ink study of 'Pollarded trees and standing stones', the herring bone brick-work sketched in 'Detail of a wall in Boxgrove Priory'.\n\nThe book offers a feeling of contemplation of the artist's surroundings, each image a carefully observed rendering of the shapes and textures he sees. Latticeworks of branches, pillars and brickwork; the markings on a piece of flint; the arrangement of a group of standing stones, all are captured and echoed by the marks Norris makes on the paper, be it the cross-hatching of an etching or the strokes of paint in a stencilled print. In this way the artist presents a quiet sense of order, pattern and rhythm hidden amongst the apparent disorder of the environments he depicts.",
