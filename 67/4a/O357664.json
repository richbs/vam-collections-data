It is possible that they were outdoor and/or middle-class accessories and therefore seldom appear in Tudor and Jacobean portraiture which emphasises the formal dress of the aristocracy.   \n\nThis hood is very modestly adorned with insertion work (bobbin lace worked between two pieces of linen) and a bobbin lace edging, but the quality of the linen and the sewing is extremely fine.  The short gap between the crown of the hood and the top of the insertions suggest that it was worn with a ruff.",
