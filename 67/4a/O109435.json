Like his contemporary Bishop Lancelot Andrewes, he regarded the Anglican church as a purified form of traditional Catholicism. Together they set out to restore the ceremonial that had been abolished with the Reformation of the previous century, including the high altar and the use of candles and incense.\n\nLaud\u2019s intentions, however, were seen by Parliament as an attempt to overthrow the Protestant religion and in 1645 he was beheaded. It was not until the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 that churches could again use a Gothic chalice and celebrate the Eucharist with an elaborately chased and decorated communion set.\n\nThe donor of this flagon to Easton Maudit, Sir Henry Yelverton, was described by Thomas Percy, Rector of Easton Maudit, as 'that true son & great ornament of the Church of England'. Sir Henry provided accommodation in his own home to Bishop Thomas Morton, the former chaplain to King James I, who was successively Dean of Gloucester and Winchester and then Bishop of Chester, Lichfield and Coventry and Durham. Bishop Morton was disgraced by Parliament and turned out of the Bishop's Palace in Durham. Bishop Morton died at Easton Maudit in 1659 'having given his Chalice with a Patin for the Cover (both double gilt) to the Noble Baronet in whose family he died for the use of his Chappel lately built'.",
