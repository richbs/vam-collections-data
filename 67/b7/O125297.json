Following its display at the Great Exhibition of 1851, the sculpture became one of the most recognizable and widely discussed figures of the second half of the 19th century. Sometimes interpreted obliquely as a critique of slavery in America, the figure appeared widely in ballads, satires, journalism, prints and engravings.\n\nCotton\n\nGiven by E.A. Hunt on behalf of the West Kent Federation of Women's Institutes\nV&A: T.86-1957"

Following its display at the Great Exhibition of 1851, the sculpture became one of the most recognizable and widely discussed figures of the second half of the 19th century. Sometimes interpreted obliquely as a critique of slavery in America, the figure appeared widely in ballads, satires, journalism, prints and engravings.

Little is known about the history when it came to the attention of the WI at an exhibition of needlework in East Kent (c.1920\u201322). It was subsequently purchased by a Miss Rowe and donated to the V&A in 1957. Prior to acquisition, it was assessed by the quilt historian Avril Colby, who suggested that the striped \u2018fencing\u2019 border and range of animals may indicate \u2018rural family life on a farm\u2019. With the identification of the central silhouettes, it is now thought that the coverlet is a more active engagement with the contemporaneous debates and a wider culture of exhibition and display.",

One of the most popular American statues of the second half of the nineteenth century, <i>The Greek Slave</i> portrays a Greek girl captured by the Turks and put up for sale in a Middle Eastern slave market. The sculptor said of his work: \n\n'As there should be a moral in every work of art, I have given to the expression of the Greek Slave what trust there could still be in a Divine Providence for a future state of existence, with utter despair for the present, mingled somewhat with scorn for all around her . . . It is not her person but her spirit that stands exposed.' \n\nThe statue became one of the most recognizable and widely discussed figures of the second half of the nineteenth century, popularized through ballads, prints, satire, journalistic commentaries and engravings. It was exhibited in the American Section of the Great Exhibition in 1851, and miniature copies were available for the rest of the century; \u2018so undressed, yet so refined, in sugar-white alabaster, exposed under little glass covers in such American homes as could bring themselves to think such things right,\u2019 as the writer Henry James remarked.",
