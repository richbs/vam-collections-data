Decorated with rows of cotton machine-embroidered net, artificial pearls made from cellulose nitrate, and metal thread tassels. The pointed, elbow-length bodice is boned and lined with cotton. It opens at the front and fastened with lacing. The very low neckline would have been filled in with a lace chemisette - dress currently has a modern chiffon replica chemisette. A thin silk ribbon runs around the outer edge of the lace along the neckline and would have tied at the front to keep the lace close to the body. The side seams of the bodice have been let out by about an inch. Underneath the arms inside are small silk covered pads to absorb perspiration. The point at the back of the bodice is heavily boned and designed to extend outwards resting at an angle of almost 90 degrees to the body, and held up by a bustle cage.\n[Skirt] Skirt of silk satin with a train. Decorated with rows of cotton machine-embroidered net, artificial pearls made from cellulose nitrate, and metal thread tassels. The skirt is constructed from a silk satin base onto which several layers are draped. The straight base is covered with asymmetric rows of the same lace as found on the bodice, and is further decorated with ten tassels composed of metal thread and artificial pearls. Along the bottom of the skirt is an intricately pleated silk satin frill. Three panels of satin fabric of the same width make up the train. The outermost ones are draped across the front and tacked roughly into place and pulled back over the bustle. The outer edges are folded onto the surface of the train and are stitched down. Underneath the outer edge of the train is a brush frill of heavily starched and pleated plain weave cotton. Inside the skirt at the centre back is a square silk-covered cushion intended to rest on a bustle cage. Also inside the skirt, just below where the bustle cage would have been, are two sets of boned tapes which when tied secure the flat and slender front. The skirt fastens at the waist with four hooks and eyes.\n[Veil] Cream net veil decorated with costume pearls.\n[Under petticoat] Under petticoat of cream satin.",
