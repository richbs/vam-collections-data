This is not the same design as T.38A-1924.\nHand-made dark brown silk net.  There is a strip of faded purple velvet sewn along the upper edge.  \nThere is evidence that a fabric with metal thread was stitched down the left hand side.\nA blue and light blue chevron is either side of the border which contains a red, yellow and green leaf-like motif. On the whole this motif is alternately inward and outward facing, but not consistently. There is a line of three white flowers on either side and it alternates with a large red, almost circular blossom. The central area has straight green stems, each with a pair of blue flowers at the base, with 5 light yellow and pink flowers outlined with metal thread alternating with an angled green stem with 2 pink blossoms at the bottom, a group of 3 mid-way which are yellow, outlined with red and with metal thread and a blossom at the top in which pairs of lines form a green base and then 6 pink petals, ending with a green stem and pink bud outlined with metal thread. There are small white flowers on the ground and 6 small downward pointing sprigs coming from the top edge: 2 blue and one pink flower. The metal thread is copper strip close S-wound on pale silk.",
