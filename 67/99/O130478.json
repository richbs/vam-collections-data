He exhibited furniture at the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society over a long period. He appears to have specialised in cabinets on stands, all with curving strap-work on the doors, similar to the pattern on the front of this cabinet. Designed by Spooner and made under his personal supervision, it was exhibited at the Paris Exhibition of 1925. After his death his widow offered to bequeath it to the V&A. Ralph Edwards, Keeper of the Furniture and Woodwork Department at the Museum, had been Spooner's friend and in 1939 recommended acceptance of the proposed bequest, describing Spooner as 'a learned ecclesiologist and man of fine taste, and closely identified with the Early Crafts Movement'. It came to the V&A on Mrs Spooner's death in 1950.",
