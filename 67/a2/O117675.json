Pugin, was produced for the Bishop's House of St Chad's Roman Catholic Cathedral, Birmingham in about 1840.\n\nThe Glastonbury chair form was very popular in the nineteenth century, owing to the belief that it was based on a medieval prototype.  The numerous versions made were based on a chair found at the Bishops Palace, Wells.  However, the exact history and age of the Wells chair are uncertain.  Pugin visited Wells in 1835 or 1836 and the chair he subsequently designed follows the shape of the Wells example exactly, but omits the carved decoration of the arms and back.",

The Roman Catholic Abbey at Fort Augustus, Inverness-shire, had a large collection of these chairs in the Calefactory (see Christina M. Anderson, 'Furnishing Fort Augustus Abbey, Inverness-shire', <u>Regional Furniture</u>, Vol. XXI, 2007. pp. 221-240, fig. 15). Gillow, a furniture-making firm based in Lancaster with a London branch, listed in their Estimate Sketch Books an oak Glastonbury monk's chair in 1840 and a more elaborate version, with a carved panel in the back, in 1873 (Westminster Archives, GWG0344, 344/137, p. 20, March 21st 1840; 344/138, p. 140, March 1st 1873). \n\nA letter to the <u>Builidng News</u>, 9th November 1866, p. 751, compared Charles Bevan's Gothic furniture designs unfavourably with that for the Glastonbury chair. '...I am certain that it is not by chamfering and nicking and notching, or by dabbing on round spots at intervals like red, black, or white wafers, that organ cases can be made pleasing, or mediaeval furniture satisfactory. The Glastonbury chair was neither nitched, notched nor spotted, but is held to be a good chair nevertheless.'",
