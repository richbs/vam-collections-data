In her letter of August 26 1953 she says 'On reading an account of the exhibition of Indian art which took place in London recently  I remembered that I had the enclosed drawings in my possession and wondered if they would be of interest to you. & if you could tell me something about them. I had them given to me in 1915 after I had had a small exhibition of my own watercolours in Calcutta. I hope I am not wrong in sending the drawings. I was told it was the right place to do so! I would be very glad if you could give me an opinion. & that is not giving you any trouble. \nYrs sincerely (Miss) Margaret W. Patterson. [Nethercott, Braunton, Devon]\n\nWGA replied that they are 'from the Kangra valley in what is now the East Punjab and are examples of artists' 'working sketches' which were used as models for finished pictures done afterwards. They date from the beginning of the 19th century and are not of any commercial value. They are of great interest, however, for study purposes and if you would care to consider presenting them to the Museum, we would be delighted to have them. Would you let me know what you feel about this?\nYours very sincerely,\nW.G. Archer\n\nMiss Patterson's next letter says she would be 'simply delighted'.",
