It doesn't have any tags attached, however the design indicates that it was made by Steiff.\nSteiff was founded in 1880 by Margarete Steiff, who designed the prototypes herself. However, it did not initially make teddy bears, something it began in 1902, and is now world famous for. The company remains popular to this day and its soft toys are known for their high quality.",
