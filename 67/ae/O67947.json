The glass stems rested in the notches in the rim while the glass bowls dipped into the cold water inside the monteith. Monteiths are supposedly named after a 'fantastical Scot' called Monteith, whose cloak had a scalloped bottom edge. They became fashionable from about 1680 and were also made in ceramic and glass. They usually had a scalloped upper rim. The detachable scalloped collars that appeared around 1690 allowed monteiths to be converted into punch bowls. Many surviving monteiths that have lost their detachable collars have been mistakenly called punch bowls.\n\nDrinking vessels and accessories reflected the wealth and status of the owner. This monteith is of Sheffield plate, which is copper fused with silver. Sheffield plate was significantly less expensive than sterling silver. Manufacturers used it to produce a wide range of domestic goods that looked like solid silver but cost half as much. Monteiths had fallen out of fashion by the time this example was made.",
