Skill is needed in preparing wet clay to give it strength and ease of modelling, also to remove excess water and air before it is fired in a kiln. Firing fuses the clay particles and causes other structural changes that affect the colour and lead to shrinkage of about 10%. Comparatively few works in unfired clay survive because they are fragile and easily damaged. This figure is unfired and you can see the natural colour of the clay. Clay that is merely dried and not fired is known as \u2018terra secca\u2019. This is an unfired sketch model for grotesque masks on the fa\u00e7ade of a building.",
