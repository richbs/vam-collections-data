S., pp. 165-6).  Davies, pp. 38-9, has identified these two views as those engraved by Lucas with the titles \u2018Hampstead Heath, Harrow in the distance\u2019 and \u2018Hampstead Heath\u2019 (<i>English Landscape Scenery</i>, Bohn\u2019s edition, 1855, Nos. 10 and 13; S. 47 and S. 51).  The latter is in the collection of Herr Oskar Reinhart of Winterhur (Beckett, IV, p. 194).  No. 247 has no obvious connection with either of these paintings.  If then the inscription on the back could be interpreted to mean that Schroth had ordered a picture to be made for him from his sketch, it would help to establish the composition of one of the other works Constable made for him.  Schroth ordered at least six pictures from Constable at various times (L. ed. S., pp. 187 and 206).\n<u>The Abstraction of Landscape: From Northern Romanticism to Abstract Impressionism</u> Madrid: Fundaci\u00f3n Juan March, 2007.
