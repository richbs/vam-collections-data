He writes: 'It was a hot, fatiguing journey, and scarcely repaid me for my trouble, though the scene at the junction was certainly remarkable. The two rivers had each worn for themselves a deep, narrow channel through the mountains\u2026. Through these narrow gorges, which could not be less than 300 feet deep, the waters rushed in muddy fury time till they co-mingled and flowed on more peacefully in a wider channel\u2026.It was difficult to make a satisfactory picture of this scene, striking though it was, as it could only be taken from above. By means of Ross\u2019s wide-angle doublet I succeeded in getting two views of it, though they fail in giving an adequate idea of the depth of these singular passages.'",
