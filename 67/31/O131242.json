It indicates the close association of the original owner with the English crown, and is unlikely to have been owned by a member of the royal family. It is said to have been found in a garden in West Horsley, Guildford in 1921.\n\n Small enamelled shields like this were used as equestrian ornaments, to decorate the breast band of a horse or the fitting on the headstall. Such badges proclaimed the identity, allegiance and status of the horse's owner.Horses were of central importance to medieval society, essential for fighting wars, for transport and for leisure activities like hawking and hunting.\n\n Evidence of early heraldic arms on such ornaments, such as the arms of Richard of Cornwall, (1209-1272) suggests that they were in use in the 13th century, and their popularity continued into the 15th century.",

It was purchased by the museum for \u00a32 the same year.\n\nHistorical significance: This pendant shows the development of heraldry as ornament and the spread of heraldic symbols to smaller parts of the knight's equipment such as equestrian ornament. It bears the royal arms of England, and was possibly worn as a sign of loyalty to the crown or to show an affiliation with the king.",
