The construction is therefore quite complex, but the finished work is extremely light. The form may be seen in an illustration to a study of South Indian jewellery written by E. B. Havell in 1894, showing typical jewellery found on the western coast of the southernmost tip of the subcontinent.  He noted that jewellery from the Malabar coast and Trivandrum was very different from that worn to the east. The necklace was acquired by the Indian Museum in London in 1855 and was transferred to the South Kensington Museum, later renamed the Victoria and Albert Museum, in 1879.",
