It was found in a grave at Akhmim by the German archaeologist R. Forrer and dated to the 6th-7th centuries. Hitherto, most Egyptian tunics were cut in a T-shape, but the tunic shown here is of a more 'tailored' cut. It has a neck opening at the side with a slit along the shoulder; the sleeves are slightly curved narrowing towards the wrists but most importantly, gores have been inserted in the side seams of the skirt, allowing the garment a better shape and fit. This reflects the development of tailoring in the 5th and 6th centuries in Egypt which is thought to have been introduced by foreign tunics, predominantly from Syria and Iran.",
