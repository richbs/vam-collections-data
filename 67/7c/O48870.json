This was a turbulent period in English history and medallions, usually in bronze or silver, were struck to commemorate important events or serve as propaganda.  In 1691 William III  ordered a medal of himself as the liberator of England, Scotland and Ireland. \n\nTime\nTo his supporters, William represented the return of constitutional monarchy and the salvation of Protestantism. Thus his assumption to the throne in 1688 was hailed as the 'Glorious Revolution'.  His predecessor James II represented 'popery', a derogatory term for Catholicism, and absolutism, the autocratic rule associated with Louis XIV and France.\n\nMaterials & Making\nBoxwood is a close-grained hardwood particularly suited to small and intricate carving. Its colour ranges from yellow to orange-brown and when polished it develops a shiny surface.  Box was then grown in south-east England and John Evelyn, in Silva: or A Discourse on Forest-Trees (1662), said it was 'of special use for the turner, engraver, carver who give great prices for it by weight, as well as measure'.",
