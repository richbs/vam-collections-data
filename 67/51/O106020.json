Her hair is pulled back into red fringed ribbon loops at the back.  Over a white, elbow-length open-sleeved blouse is an off-the-shoulder grey bodice with a peplum, laced across the front and decorated with yellow scrolls, the wide, short sleeves split to the shoulder. The hem of the below-the-knee length underskirt is decorated with a band of yellow leaves; the shorter white overskirt is scattered with yellow oak leaves and caught up over her left leg, where it is held by a spray of yellow oak leaves and acorns.  In the background is a plinth and in the foreground a flowering shrub and a floral wreath.  The print area is cut across the upper corners.",

In 1838 she appeared in La Gitana (The Gipsy), a typical Romantic ballet story of a child stolen from her aristocratic parents and brought up as a gipsy before being restored to her family.  The print shows her in the costume for her Spanish solo.  This was a direct challenge to her great rival, Fanny Elssler, whose particular forte was the wild, exotic Spanish Cachucha.  Taglioni's solo was rapturously received by her audiences.  In the print, the flowers on the floor represent floral tributes thrown by her admirers.  \nBy 1840 a recognisable 'ballet' costume had evolved - a low-cut pointed bodice, or a little blouse worn under a laced bodice, and a bell-shaped, knee-length skirt formed of tiers of tarlatan with a diaphanous top layer.   To this were added various details indicating indicate the character, status or nationality of the particular role.",
