            "history_note": "Acquired as late '60s, however, is probably more likely to be early 1970s, as Bates also used this same textile to create a large rectangular caftan, likewise trimmed with black and white braid. His caftan phase seems to have been around 1973-1974, so this dress is probably contemporaneous to them. Bates does not appear to have re-used his very distinctive printed textiles across seasons.\n\nThis is an atypically restrained design for this period of John Bates. From about 1973 to 1975, his dresses were frequently voluminious, dramatic, and featured startling details and a lavish, abundant use of fabric. In addition to his vividly patterned caftans, his signature look of 1973-1975 comprised ruffles, frills, flounces, fancy braids and multiple fabrics/prints, often with immensely full skirts and sleeves.",
