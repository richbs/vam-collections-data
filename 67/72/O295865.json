Mayer (cautiously) identified the father as the Sudun al-Abu Bakri mentioned in the Mamluk chronicles, who was originally a <i>mamluk</i> of the sultan al-Malik al-Mu'ayyad Shaykh, hence his <i>nisbah</i> of al-Mu'ayyadi. This man was appointed governor of Hama in AH 855 (began on 3 February 1451) and was dismissed before 31 August 1452. He was later commander-in-chief of Aleppo and died in July 1461. \n\nThe identification with this Sudun seems sound - Fatimah would have recorded his governorship of Hamah because it was the most eminent post he held. As the prayer inserted after Sudun's name is for a deceased person in need of God's mercy, the bowl must have been made after 1461.",
