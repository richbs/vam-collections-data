She rests her head on a pillow, with most of her body beneath a bed-covering which hangs down over the side of the bed. A female attendant, wearing a loose gown, arranges the bed-covering over St. Elizabeth's left shoulder. Another female attendant, wearing a loose gown, holds the tightly swaddled infant St. John with both hands. A third loose-gowned female attendant stands on the right of the panel behind the bed with hands together. In the bottom right-hand corner the bearded Zacharias sits in a chair with a rounded back, holding a scroll with his left hand and with his right doubtless writing the name of the infant. He wears a belted gown with a loose pointed collar and a round hat with an upturned brim. The fourth female attendant, wearing a gown with a belt, kneels at the bottom of the panel at the left, stirring a pot which rests on a tripod over a fire. There is an empty round-backed chair behind her. Above the scene at the top of the panel is an intricately carved bed canopy. The details of the eyes of the figures, as well as many other details, have been carved with precision.\n\nThe right hands of Zacharias and the kneeling female attendant are both missing. There is no colour on the panel. The back of the panel has a typically English look. There are five lead-plugged holes. The bottom has been cut away.",

The stone however appears to be English. The scene illustrates the gospel account of the naming of St John the Baptist which is not commonly represented in medieval English alabaster work. \n\nSt Elizabeth wearing a long-sleeved gown with her head veiled, lies on the right side of a bed with her right hand supporting her head. She rests her head on a pillow, with most of her body beneath  a bed-covering which hangs down over the side of the bed. In the background Elizabeth is tended by a number of female attendants one of whom holds the tightly swaddled infant John with both hands.  In the foreground another female attendant kneels, stirring a pot which rests on a tripod over a fire.",
