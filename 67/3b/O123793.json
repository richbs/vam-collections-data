The most desirable clasps were made of silver or gold. They were often treated like pieces of costume jewellery and could be transferred from one garment to the other. This example has vertical bars down the back of each separate piece. These could be stitched onto the fabric of the cloak to hold the clasp in place. \n\nThis piece belonged to a working woman and gives an important insight into the type of fashion accessories someone of her class might wear. Although it is not made of precious metal and was probably inexpensive, it is stamped with an attractive design of angels\u2019 heads and wings. \n\nIts original owner was probably Emily Woodstock, who later became Mrs Button. Emily was born in 1882 and was a pupil of the church school at St Mary's, Bryanston Square, London. After she left school she became a parlourmaid in a house in Clapham, married a coachman and then set up home in West Hampstead. Emily earned a little money by typing the works of a lady novelist.",
