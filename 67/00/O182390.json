The performances utilise masks and elaborate costume.\n\nThis is a substantial mask, robustly carved from a thick piece of hinoki, with the carving confidently executed. The original colour of the mask appears to be of a predominantly yellowish brown colour over a very thin layer of gofun, with details of the lips painted in red. The whites of the deep-set eyes are also red with sumi details. The area around the eyes and ears are highlighted with subtle shading of red paint under the main yellow colour. The mask is generally dirty overall and has some staining on the forehead which may be the result of a damp cord being left on the surface after a performance.\n\nDetails of hair are added in alternating lines of black, grey and off-white, while the moustache and beard are of real white horse-hair, most of which still remains. The original metal eyes and teeth having been lost, are repainted in gold. There appears to be mica scattered onto the upper teeth which, along with the gums, are exposed by the smiling open mouth. Most of the details of the face have been finished with the chisel and the extremely thin coating of gofun serves only as a surface for the paint to adhere to.\n\nThe high domed forehead and the raised eyebrows together with the delicately carved wrinkles (with a pair of curious comma-like marks between the eyes) add to the overall image of a benevolent deity. The interior of the mask has a pattern of distinctive broad horizontal chisel marks over the surface and the wood has been stained a dark colour. There are traces of a paper label on the right-hand side, and at the top of the mask there is a paper label with the character Shina (collection) and the number 5 written in pencil.\n\nUsed for roles like the spurned gardener in Koi-no-Omoni or the dragon god in Nezame or Choryo.",
