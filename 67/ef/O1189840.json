Based in London, the two have  collaborated on a broad range of photographic projects.  The ten platinum- palladium prints in this portfolio, taken from the two series 'Athletes' and 'Gymnasts', focuses on various aspects of sport and the lives of athletes from many countries.  In their reference to Hellenic sculpture and classical  forms, and dramatic use of light and shadow, these images evoke 1930s nude studies by leading European photographers such as Baron George  Hoyningen-Huene and George Platt Lynes and the prevalent 'healthy body culture' of the late 1920s and 1930s.",
