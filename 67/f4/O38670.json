The jig consists of a rectangular block of steel with two pieces of translucent pale pink cellulose acetate screwed to one face of it, with a voided shape between them.  The shape is in the form of part of the front of a pair of spectacles, with two small holes drilled in the steel plate where the top corner of the frame would be.  During the process of making a pair of NHS spectacles, once the whole frame front had been cut from a sheet of cellulose acetate (using templates like B.314, 315-1996), each side was inserted into this third template in turn, and the pair of small holes used as a guide to drill holes for affixing the hinged sides.",
