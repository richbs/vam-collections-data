The most unusual motifs appeared on bottles made in the 17th century.  This one, for example, features a lion tamer and a lion on one side, and a lion and a qilin-like creature on the other.\n\nIn the 16th century, ceramic production in Iran was on a modest scale. When the ruling Safavid dynasty moved the capital to Isfahan around 1600, the production of luxury dishes and wall tiles in a wide variety of styles and techniques rapidly increased.\n\nIt is not possible to identify a particular centre of ceramic production. Among the many techniques potters used were underglaze painting, coloured glazes and lustre, which was revived after 1650.",
