Some twenty of these proofs would be made and then marked up by the print designer to indicate his desired colour scheme. As seen on this print, he would indicate in red the areas to be printed and then paint in the margin the actual colour to be used. Hokusai was well known for his representations of chickens and other fowl; in this print a family of chickens nestle together.",
