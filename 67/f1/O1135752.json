            "public_access_description": "Best known by his pen-name Lewis Carroll, Charles Lutwidge Dodgson was also a mathematics don at Christ Church, Oxford, and an accomplished amateur photographer. The affection of the author of Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland  for children is well-known, and indeed, many of Dodgson\u2019s best photographs are sensitive portraits of his \u2018child friends\u2019. These range from straightforward portraits of children dressed in their own clothes (see the portrait of Xie Kitchin, Ph.408-1981) to photographs of children in fancy-dress, sometimes acting out narratives.  \n\nSt George and the Dragon is one of Dodgson\u2019s most ambitious narrative photographs, in which all four Kitchin siblings (the children of George William Kitchin (1827-1912), dean of Christ Church) use the accoutrements of the nursery to act out this allegory of the triumph of good over evil.  In a belted nightgown and a cardboard crown, Alexandra \u2018Xie\u2019 Rhoda (1864-1925) plays the princess while her brother Brook Taylor (1869-1940), as St George, rides a rocking horse to her rescue.  George Herbert (b.1865) is the dead soldier and Hugh Bridges (1867-1945), draped in a leopard-skin rug, the vanquished dragon.  The photograph was made in Dodgson\u2019s attic studio at Christ Church on 26 June 1875.",
