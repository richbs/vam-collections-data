The principal feature of the Argand lamp was a special burner that consisted of a cotton wick surrounded by concentric tubes. This allowed a double current of air to be drawn through the wick. This greatly increased the size and brightness of the flame and in consequence, increased the illumination that the lighting device gave out. It was also found that a glass chimney improved the upward draught of air and this soon became an essential feature of the light.\n\nPeople\nThe Argand lamp was first developed by a Swiss chemist, Aim\u00e9 Argand (1758-1803), when he was working in France between 1782 and 1784. It gave up to twelve times the light given out by a single candle and was considered by many to be excessively bright and bad for the eyes.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe chandelier is made of bronze and ormolu (gilt bronze). The fuel used was colza oil produced from rape seed. Because the oil was heavy and thick, a large central reservoir was needed to feed the oil by gravity to the wick.\n\nArgand lamps and chandeliers were popular throughout the 19th century. Both Matthew Boulton (1728-1809) and Josiah Wedgwood (1730-1795) manufactured them. Because the lamps were so efficient, they were still being made in the 20th century.",
