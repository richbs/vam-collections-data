Right hand side: 2 cords overcast with white cotton.\n\nEND FINISH: Lower: immediately below the pile is 1.5 cms.  of plain weave with dark brown weft; below for 2.5 cms. is basket weave with light brown weft in groups of three passing over groups of three warp threads.  The fringe is incomplete but 9 cms. long with three warp threads twisted and two of these clusters knotted together.  Upper: 1 cm. plainweave with red weft and with 2.5 cm. of warp twining.  The fringe is incomplete but there is evidence that the warp threads  were twisted in groups of 4, and then 2 of these were knotted together with a single knot; remaining fringe is 10 cm. long.\n\nDESIGN: Field: the lowest is 105.5 cms. has a brown ground with three narrow bands of dark blue which become the ground colour for the rest of the carpet.  Two and one half large latticed hexagonal medallions share their field's ground colour with each lattice containing a small floral motif.  The lowest medallion contains an irregular hexagonal medallion, floral and geometric motifs; an innermost red medallion has a circle of white flowerheads around a small diamond within opposed W-motifs.  The middle medallion has one inner medallion and its pendant with plump floral decoration.  The upper medallion is incomplete.  A variety of small motifs including birds and animals are repeated across the vertical axis.  Four motifs between the middle and the upper medallions repeat the design at the centre of the lowest medallion.\n\nBorders from the inside:\n(1) reciprocal diamond heads; the lower half is red and light green changing to yellow and towards the top, to light blue. \n(2) white ground with flat-topped triangles in a variety of colours linked by a dark brown line which has, to either side, an inward-facing triangle.\n(3) reciprocal diamond heads; the lower part is dark red and blue changing in the upper third to red and light blue.\n\nCatalogue date. 6.5.97",
