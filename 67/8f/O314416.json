These had been included with the remaining stock of plaster casts and moulds which were in the possession of the Brucciani cast-selling business, when it was taken over by the Museum agency, the Department for the Sale of Casts, in 1921.\n\nThis figure may be Italian or English, when accessioned in 1934 it was tentatively attributed to Canova. Some of the most important plaster casts acquired by the Museum were commissioned through the Anglo-Italian firm established by Domenico Brucciani (1815-1880). His most illustrious achievement was the cast of the Portal of the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela. The importance of the Brucciani cast selling business in the supply of casts to art schools, and the strong connections with the British Museum and the V&amp;A were such that when the company ran into financial difficulties in 1921, it was taken over by the Board of Education as a public service, and organised as an educational branch of the V&amp;A, named the Department for the Sale of Casts. The sale of casts continued at the Museum till 1951.",
