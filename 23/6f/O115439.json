            "historical_context_note": "Girdles and belts were an essential part of both male and female dress. They could be made of leather, rich textiles mounted with metal mounts or from the late thirteenth century, entirely of precious metals. In 1296, the accounts of the Tyrol court contain the record of a 'gold girdle of gold everywhere' and a 'girdle entirely of silver', further references from the courts of England, Artois, Portugal and Carinthia record other solid metal girdles, although these were always less common than the textile or leather sort, perhaps because of their weight and expense (Lightbown, 1992). However, during the sixteenth century, although men continued to wear leather belts, the fashion for women moved towards metal belts, often of silver or sometimes, gold. \n\nGirdles served a practical as well as a decorative function, being used to suspend purses and pockets, keys, knives, prayer books and other small items. Girdles such as this are thought to have been used by brides, symbolising their new domestic responsibilities. \nComparable examples can be found in German collections in Munich (Stolleis, 1977, cat.74), K\u00f6ln (Chadour & Joppien, 1985, cat. 354, 355) and in Danish hoards (Lindahl, 1988, cat. 10, 21, 29). \n\nThe V&A possesses a German painting of a woman wearing a similar girdle, dated 1582 (museum number 4833-1857). There is also a 1634 painting from Frederiksborg of Sophie H\u00f8eg wearing a plainer metal girdle (Lindahl, p.59). An engraving from the late 1560s, also illustrated in Lindhal, shows a richly dressed woman wearing a belt from which hangs a purse and other personal items.",
