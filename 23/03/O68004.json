This collection focuses on slogans and was designed during a traumatic period of the duo's career, the loss of a close friend through AIDS caused them great distress.  The 'feel-good' factor behind the 'IT' collection, was based on slogans broadcasting positive happy messages.  This collection coincided with the reappearance of the term the 'It Girl' in the mid '90s.  Antoni & Alison (A&A) see themselves as having played an important role in the bold, positive feeling that the 'It Girl' represents.  During this period A&A moved away from the labour intensive screen printing to the use of transfer printing.  This collection of material includes a scribbled design on a napkin, the collection plan, notebook and notes, collages of slogans, a transfer and sample on jersey.",
