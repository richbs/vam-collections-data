Jainism is one of the oldest religions to have survived until the present time and its basic teaching is one of non-violence.  The Kalpasutra is divided into three sections.   The first section deals with the lives of the twenty-four Jinas or Tirthankaras, who were the Jain spiritual teachers or 'ford-makers'.  The second part deals with the life of Mahavira, the twenty-fourth Tirthankara.  The third part deals with rules for the ascetics and laws during the four months (chaturmas) of the rainy season, when ascetics temporarily abandon their wandering life and settle down amidst the laity. This is the time when the festival of Paryushan is celebrated and the Kalpasutra is traditionally recited.\nHere the Shakra, chief of the gods, is commanding Harinaigameshin, the antelope- headed divine general, to transfer Mahavira's embryo from the Brahmani Devananda's womb to that of Trishala, a Kshatriya woman who was to gave birth to him. Brahmans are the hereditary priestly estate, while Kshatriyas were traditionally warriors or rulers. The illustration is opulently coloured with gold, blue and red, underlining the importance placed on such manuscripts.",
