The family came from High Easter near Chelmsford. The bride chose to be married in a purple silk day dress due to her advanced age (she was 37). While purple is typically a half-mourning colour, there is no known association with a death in the bride's family.\n\nBefore marriage Harriett was a lady\u2019s maid to Mrs Crowley Boevey in West Kensington. Harriett's husband was a representative from the Water Board. She was a accomplished needlewoman who made her own dress and who may have altered it the following year to make the skirt narrower (parts T.309:C to F-1982 are two skirt gores and interlinings; the other parts H to J are also fabric remnants from the dress) and more fashionable, although the alteration is so neat as to be invisible. Harriett was known as a neat, brisk woman who was said to have bought her and her husband's home with her own savings. (Information given by donor upon delivery of dress)",
