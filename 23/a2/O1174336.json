A theatre collective, for the most part devising its own shows, its work developed through a process of collaborative improvisation and invention, owing much to international theatre influences, particularly French, in its concentration on physical, rather than purely intellectual, theatre. The Visit was first seen at the Almeida Theatre in 1989 and was subsequently re-staged at the National Theatre in 1991.  Kathryn Hunter's interpretation of the monstrous Clara Zachanassian was highly praised. Associated production: The Visit. Designer: Rae Smith. Directors: Annabel Arden, Simon McBurney. Wearer and actor: Kathryn Hunter. Character: Clara Zachanassian. Performing company: Theatre de Complicite. Royal National Theatre / Lyttelton Theatre, London, 13.2.1991. Other costumes worn by Kathryn Hunter and understudy in The Visit, and pieces of the set for The Visit: S.1093:1 to S.1098-1997.",
