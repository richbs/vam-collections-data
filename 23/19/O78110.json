            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nIn England miniatures were usually portraits painted from life.  But in the 1620s at the request of  Charles I, the miniaturist Peter Oliver painted copies of oil paintings in the King's collection. Charles was a great connoisseur and this request reflects the value he placed on his collection and on the exquisite watercolour art of miniature painting.  This established the tradition of copying great paintings in miniature.\n\nPeople \nHorace Walpole was a collecter, particularly of portraits.  His collection of miniatures was in his own words 'the largest and finest in the country'.  Although this miniature was sold at the sale held at Walpole's home in 1842, unfortunately it is not mentioned in Walpole's own catalogue in 1784, nor in the 1800 catalogue compiled after his death.  So it is unclear if it actually belonged to Walpole.\n\nOwnership & Use\n Walpole's interest in this miniature would have been as much with the sitter as the artist.  Antoine Triest was a notable collector and friend of  artists such as van Dyck.  Walpole avidly collected  likenesses of the famous and often commissioned copies himself.  In contrast, Charles Beale probably painted his copy in miniature of this famous image as a homage to the painterly skill of van Dyck. He probably copied an oil copy belonging to his father who referred in his diary to 'my bishops picture of Van Dykes'.",

No. 148 [555-1905]), the attribution to Charles Beale the Younger was first published by Goulding, who did not, however, comment on the difference between this version of the <i>CB</i>monogram - a variant of the type identified by Vertue as belonging to Beale the Younger, but with the upper end of the <i>C</i> failing to complete its loop back on to the vertical stroke, and thus failing to make the <i>B</i> clearly; and those which he otherwise recognised. Basil Long (1 930) was aware of the difference but did not dissent from Goulding's judgement. Neither commented on stylistic matters, although prima facie the <i>Lely</i> is painted in a bold, direct hatch with some stipple blended in, while the <i>Triest</i>, which perhaps experimentally even lacks a vellum, is painted predominantly in a soft stipple that blurs rather than accentuates the sitter's features and the fall of light and shade. When taken in combination with the two <i>Lauderdale</i> portraits (Cat. Nos 150 and 151), they give an impression that Beale was an unusually protean artist. All are catalogued here as by Charles Beale the Younger, an attribution that has received the recent support of Elizabeth Walsh and Richard Jeffree (1975-6) and which it does not yet seem possible to question substantially. As Croft-Murray and Hulton (1960) point out, the source for this miniature was probably the 'Bishops picture of Van Dykes' referred to in the diary of Charles Beale the Elder, 20 April 1672: Mr. Lely was here. (meaning I think) to see Mrs. Beal (& her workers) with Mr. Gibson and Mr. Skipwith to see us ... Mr. Lely told me at the same time as he was most studiously looking at my Bishops picture of Van Dykes - and I chanced to ask him how Sr. Anthony could possibly divise to finish in one day a face that was so exceeding full of work & wrought up to so extraordinary a p[er]fection. I believe (sd he) he painted it over 14 times. (2)\n\nThere are several versions of the painting from which Charles Beale (the Elder) could have worked, for example one sold at Sotheby's 16 March 1966, lot 20, which may have been the prime version, for it was said to have been formerly in the possession of Antoine Triest's descendants. There is also a drawing in the British Museum series (3), convincingly attributed to Charles Beale the Younger. It would presumably have been copied from the same version of the painting as the miniature. Interestingly, in this drawing, the use of red and black chalks, with some graphite in long, elongated strokes, stumped and rubbed in order to soften the chiaroscuro, relates closely to the technique, despite the difference in medium, of the Lauderdale miniatures. It is closer to them than it is to the copy of the same portrait, the present miniature. \n\nAntoine Triest, 5th Bishop of Bruges, 7th Bishop of Ghent (Gand), was born in 1576 at the Chateau of Ten Walle at Beveren-Waes. He was the son of Philippe, seigneur of Anweghem, by his wife Marie van Royen. He was noticed as a young priest by Ferdinand and Isabella, who made him their Court chaplain and in due course despatched him to Rome to acquire ecclesiastical finish. In 1616/17 he became Bishop of Bruges, where he proved an energetic administrator and improver of the fabric of the Cathedral. In 1620 he was translated to Ghent. He was a man of broad culture, a keen botanist and gardener and an active patron of the arts. \n\nHe counted among his friends Rubens, van Dyck, Teniers and their colleagues, and paid generously for the paintings which he commissioned from them. Rubens painted for him the <i>Conversion of St Paul</i> and the <i>Massacre of the Innocents</i>. Van Dyck and Teniers painted his portrait ... he commissioned his own funeral monument from Jerome Duquesnoy for 8000 florins. The Triest mausoleum, finished in 1654, is in the opinion of Kervyn de Volkaersbeke 'the most beautiful work of the national (school of) statuary'. (4)\n\nAs well as painting his portrait in large, Van Dyck included Triest among the artists and patrons in the etched and engraved portraits of the <i>Iconographia</i>. \n\n1 Cf. monogram on Cat.
