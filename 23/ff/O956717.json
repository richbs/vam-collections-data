Engraved by Beckwith. \n\u2018The Captive Slave\u2019 is a large dog with a stern mouth, gloomy eyes, and a heavy chain, looking entreatingly up to heaven, or, in imagination perhaps, to Richard Martin, of Galway, to whom the print is inscribed. It is a powerful drawing, very cleverly engraved. We remember to have noticed, with high commendation. \u2018The Lame leading the Blind,\u2019 by these same artists : they are every way worthy of each other. The comparative facility with which a painter covers a few inches or a few feet of canvas has enabled Mr. Hancock to reap and early harvest of honest fame, but an engraver proceeds more laboriously. No young man has, in our time, come before the public, giving higher promise than Mr. Beckwith, and he seems determined to satisfy the best expectations of those who have equal pride and pleasure in having been among the first to notice him with the warmest and sincerest commendation. We regret that, in the hurry of overwhelming engagements, this clever print escaped our observation even for a few days.'",
