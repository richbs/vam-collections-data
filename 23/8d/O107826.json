The road is open for about 100 miles, and\u2026forms a beautiful mountain road for the pedestrian. It winds along successive ranges, following their windings, sometimes at an immense height above the valleys\u2026which it opens to view\u2026now and then I was favoured with a fine day and registered a number of good pictures to be dealt with on my return when the rains would be over\u2026.'\n\nOf the return journey he wrote: '\u2026I stopped now and then on the road to take a few of the pictures which I had selected on my journey out. The rain had long since cleared off and the weather was everything that the heart of a photographer could desire.'",

Below is the relevant section for this photograph: \n\nBourne writes:\n\n\u2026I left Simla on the 29th July (1863), taking the new road which is now making to Cheenee, a village about 160 miles north of Simla\u2026..The road is open for about 100 miles, and, as it is nearly level, forms a beautiful mountain road for the pedestrian. It winds along successive ranges, following their windings, sometimes at an immense height above the valleys or deep \u2018ruds\u2019 which it opens to view\u2026..now and then I was favoured with a fine day and registered a number of good pictures to be dealt with on my return when the rains would be over\u2026.\n\n(at the end of his journey)\n\u2026..In seeking again the road which I had taken to Cheenee\u2026I stopped now and then on the road to take a few of the pictures which I had selected on my journey out. The rain had long since cleared off and the weather was everything that the heart of a photographer could desire.\n\nBourne, S, Ten weeks with the camera in the Himalayas, The British Journal of Photography:\n\nParagraph 1: February 1, 1864, pg 50\nParagraph 2: February 15, 1864, pg 70.",
