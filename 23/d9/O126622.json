Many Portuguese and Spanish traditional earrings were based on 17th and 18th century patterns, but over time local differences became fixed, and patterns became characteristic of a particular place.  \n \nThis earring, called \u2018a rainha\u2019, comes from the north of Portugal.  Its shape, of a pendant hanging from a stylised bow, derives from a late 17th century design common throughout Europe.  But a 17th century earring would have had a pear-shaped drop.  In Portugal the goldsmiths replaced it with a round crescent.  This shape, which is used for traditional earrings throughout inland Spain and the north of Portugal, is very old, and may date back to the time of the Moorish occupation.  This earring was bought for \u00a31 10s (the pair) at the International Exhibition, London, 1872.\n\nThe name \u2018a rainha\u2019 means \u2018of the queen\u2019.  Earrings of this design are still made today in the north of Portugal.",
