Bell Labs was one of the focal points for the production of early computer art.  In 1963 Knowlton developed one of the earliest programming languages for producing computer animations, called BEFLIX (from Bell Flicks). Knowlton collaborated with Lillian Schwartz (born 1927, Ohio) in the late 1960s, and together they developed EXPLOR (EXplicit Patterns, Local Operations and Randomness) to create a series of films that could produce both still and moving images.  Schwartz was primarily an artist who was interested in the possibilities offered by new technologies, although she went on to become a consultant at Bell Labs.  Early computer programs were limited in their graphical ability, and Schwartz tended to enhance her work by manually producing it in more traditional materials at the final stage of production.  Transferring a computer generated image into a screenprint, such as with this work, would have enabled Schwartz to use more vivid colours than would have been possible with the computer output devices of the late 1960s.",
