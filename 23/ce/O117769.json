Upper: plain weave 1 cm. white cotton, 1 cm. red wool and 4 passes of light blue wool.  Fringe as Lower end.\n\nDESIGN: Field: white ground with a dark blue lattice outlined in red and yellow centred, dark blue crosses as links.  This creates hexagonal frames for bands of a variety of stylised floral sprigs.  Tiny stars and small botehs and diamonds fill the part frames along the side.  The pattern extends into the 5-sided angular niche and reappears in both spandrels.  In the uppermost enclosed sprigs in the niche and spandrels the topmost flower has been knotted in silk.  The niche is outlined with a border with a dark blue ground with a line of flowerheads in the form of crosses (2 are worked in silk) and 4 lozenges (3 in silk).  A half Z-motif in light green separates the flowers.\n\nBorders: described from the centre outwards:\n\n(1) reciprocal diamond heads in red and light green.\n\n(2) as niche border; along the sides are added tiny white and red crossed; in the upper border the half Z-motifs become complete S-motifs.\n\n(3) red ground with angular S-motifs with terminals ending in a pair of triangles, and with a cross bar.  Upper and lower border include facing pairs of triangles.\n\n(4) as (2) except there are no half Z-motifs.\n\nNote: there is a fault line across lower third of design - the width of the patterns have been reduced (but not in borders 3 and 4).",
