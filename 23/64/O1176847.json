This production of Tristan and Isolde was part of a series of performances which Flagstaad gave in four consecutive seasons at Covent Garden from 1948 to 1952. During this period Flagstad repeated all her best known Wagnerian roles, including Sieglinde in Die Walk\u00fcre, (the role which she had sung when making her sensational American debut at the Metropolitan Opera in 1935).",
