            "historical_context_note": "To produce a woodcut, the design was cut into the woodblock using a knife. This was usually done along the grain, and if so, could be as large as was necessary for the design. Softwood was used, such as pear, sycamore and cherry. The design was cut <i>in relief</i>, which meant that the lines to be printed were standing up. The block was inked and the image transferred to paper by applying pressure from above, either by hand or a printing press.\n\nWoodcuts had long been used for printing textiles in Europe, particularly in parts of Germany and the Netherlands. D. Bland in <i>A History of Book Illustration</i> (1958, p. 102) suggests that the early woodcutters were more likely to have previously been textile printers. Illustrations from woodcuts are thought to have first been made from around the end of the 14th century for religious indulgences, and in Europe, woodcuts were also used to print playing cards, major centres being Ulm and Augsburg, interestingly, early important centres for early printed books.  \n\nOne of the main reasons why woodcut illustration became the standard in early printed books, was that type was also cast in relief and the two could be placed together on the forme and although some overlaying of the tympan was required to make the impression better, the same pressure and printing press could be used for both.\n\nThe following comes from <i>Grove Dictionary of Art</i>:\n\nThe smooth flat surface of a thick piece of prepared wood acts as the printing surface. Usually the artist draws his design on this flat surface, and either he or his assistant cuts away with knives and gouges the areas which are to remain white in the print, leaving the design standing in relief. The surface of the block is then inked with a roller, and a sheet of sturdy paper is placed over the block. By applying vertical pressure, either by hand or by means of a press, the ink is transferred to the paper, giving an impression in reverse. In general a woodblock is more durable than a copper plate, permitting more satisfactory impressions, and thus making it more appropriate for simple popular prints, or such ephemera as playing cards. \n\nMost woods of moderate softness will serve the purpose, but the most frequently used are pear, sycamore, and cherry. The blocks are cut along the length of the tree before being planed down, and the artist is thus obliged to cut through the texture of the wood with very sharp tools. The medium imposes its own restraints upon the artist, and in general it favours a bold, direct approach with a simple and limited syntax of forms and marks. This does not preclude subtlety, however, and from the early prints of D\u00fcrer at the end of the 15th century, notably the series of the Apocalypse (1498), until the prints of Gauguin and Munch, artists have been able to articulate fine lines and complex textures from the wood.\n\nThe roots of the art are not European. Fabrics printed from wood are found in Middle Eastern work of the 5th century ad, and woodcut technique was advanced in China from the 9th century and probably earlier. However, its regular use in European art does not date until the first decades of the 15th century, when paper manufacture was established on a regular basis, particularly in northern countries such as Germany and Switzerland. Early woodcuts are usually simple devotional subjects, often based on some well-known prototype in sculpture or painting, and frequently boldly coloured by hand, or sometimes through the use of stencils. \n\nWoodcuts immediately proved a valuable ally to movable type, since the woodblock could be matched to the size of the typeface and printed simultaneously. This gave it an immense advantage over the use of copper plates in book illustration, since they had to be printed in a laborious separate process. The woodcut thus enabled many books to be cheaply and boldly illustrated, a famous example in Germany being Wolgemut's illustrations to the Nuremberg Chronicle (1491\u20134). Single sheets are rarely found in early Italian art, but book illustrations, such as the exquisite courtly designs for the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili (1499), have a linear grace, often complemented by decorative surrounds, that eluded the northern artists.\n\nIt was the woodcuts of D\u00fcrer that cast off Gothic conventions and trumpeted a new Renaissance confidence and sophistication. It is unlikely that D\u00fcrer cut many of the blocks himself (although not improbable that he mastered the craft in some early prints), but he insisted on his craftsmen matching the intricate loops and folds of his drawings in the Life of the Virgin, or the Large Passion (both of 1511). He was also very aware of the collector's market for his work, issuing numerous proofs before the regular editions with text. These woodcuts, even more than his engravings, were widely circulated abroad, influencing artists and craftsmen of every description. A high proportion of great German artists followed in his footsteps in this Golden Age of the woodcut, including Cranach, Altdorfer, Burgkmair, and Baldung; the last two making brilliant innovations in printing in colour or in chiaroscuro woodcuts. These artists did much to claim Germany as the true homeland of the woodcut, recording its forested landscape, its superstitions as well as its faith. Some important woodcuts were also made in the Netherlands by Lucas van Leyden and although Italian production was modest in comparison it could boast such prodigies as Jacobo de'Barbari's Bird's-Eye View of Venice, and numerous large woodcuts after Titian.",
