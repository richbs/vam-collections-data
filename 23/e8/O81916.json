His work is characterised by appropriation of identity and self-image, as well as of form or motif. He famously represented himself as Sid Vicious in the pose of Warhol's Elvis, and he reproduced works by Duchamp, Yves Klein and Rene Magritte, amongst others. Although much of his work references art history, he has also replicated the stuff of everyday life. In 1996 he contributed an oversized black skip to the 'Material Culture' exhibition at the Hayward Gallery in London, and at the opening of the 'Sensation show at the Royal Academy he arrived disguised as a tramp. This print elevates the humble black bin liner to an object of interest and beauty, exquisitely rendered in a six-colour lithograph. More recently he has made life-like life-size sculptures of bin bags, made of black-painted bronze.\n\nThis print was published by Counter Editions in 2000 in a portfolio of 14 works by contemporary artists.",
