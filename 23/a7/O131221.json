He travelled through the Salem district  to Srirangam, Tiruchchirappalli, Madurai, then Pudukkottai, Thanjavur, and Tiruchchirappalli again and ended his tour in Madras on 30 April 1858.\n\nThis photograph is part of the album he produced of Ryacotta, or Royacottah, and the Salem district. This is an extract of the accompanying text: \u2018Ryakotta was one of the old strong hill fortresses of the Baramahl. This division comprizes [sic], the four Taluqs (districts)of Kishnagiri, Darampuri, Tirupattur, and Tengarikotta. The country was a desert in the sixteenth century\u2026 It was Abdul Nabbi who built the twelve forts (of which Ryakotta was one) from which the territory received its designation of Baramahl (twelve Forts).

It was written off in 1937, and rediscovered and re-evaluated in the 1990s. See Dewan p.372 for listings of other copies elsewhere.\nThis photograph was published as plate I of ten in the album <u>Photographic Views of Ryacotta and other places in the Salem District</u> 1858, by 'Captain L. Tripe, Government Photographer, Madras Presidency, With Descriptive Notes by J. A. C. Boswell', published in 1860. It was taken as part of Tripe's remit as the government photographer, which he himself defined broadly, as recording, \u2018before they disappear\u2019 buildings, sculptures and inscriptions\u2026' including the picturesque. This was a model for an extensive survey, including tuition of others and experimentation in his own practice. He was funded by the Madras government, but intended selling additional copies of some prints so that his practice could be self-funding. \n\nThis print was published with this accompanying text (of which an extract follows):\n\u2018Ryakotta was one of the old strong hill fortresses of the Baramahl. This division comprises [sic], the four Taluqs of Kishnagiri, Darampuri, Tirupattur, and Tengarikotta. The country was a desert in the sixteenth century\u2026 It was Abdul Nabbi who built the twelve forts (of which Ryakotta was one) from which the territory received its designation of Baramahl (twelve Forts). He reigned thirty years, and died about 1754\u2026Tippu Saltan commenced his reign in 1782, and in 1792 these territories were made over to the East India Company. About this time the old fort of Ryacotta was repaired\u2026This view represents the Hill looking N.N.W. It is about 900 feet high, and the table land of the Baramahl is about 1200 or 1300 feet above the level of the sea. The climate generally is exceedingly healthy.\u2019\n\nHistorical significance: Tripe's photographs of South India are an important body of work within Tripe's oeuvre, and are recognised as being some of the most aesthetically and technically competent images of India made in the 19th century.\nTripe entered as total of 50 photographs from his 1857\u20138 tour of South India in the 1859 annual exhibition of the Madras Photographic Society. The jury dubbed his photographs \u2018the best in the Exhibition\u2019 but as Tripe could not be classed an amateur, he could not win the gold medal. Tripe declined the silver medal amicably, since he considered that as an official photographer he had an unfair advantage over the other entrants. \nTripe\u2019s photographs were valued for their informational value and their technical quality. The adjudicating committee stated that Tripe\u2019s photographs \u2018illustrate admirably the architecture of the Hindoo Temples and Places of Southern India, and in particular the Madura and Tanjore series comprise in this respect all that is most worthy of record in those cities.\u2019 (See Dewan, p.16). Forty-six of Tripe\u2019s 50 exhibited images were made from paper (calotype) negatives, which the committee didn't feel were as successful as dry collodion-on-glass negatives, however, declaring that \u2018the superiority of definition given by Collodion [-on-glass] is very visible when placed side by side with them.\u2019 It is thought that Tripe prefered paper to glass negatives due to paper being easier and safer to work with.",

            "historical_context_note": "<b>The southern districts tour and Madras presidency photographs, 1857\u201358</b>\nThe Madras government appointed Tripe as photographer following the 1855 directive from the Court of Directors in London, who discouraged illustration in favour of \u2018photography as a means by which representations may be obtained of scenes and buildings, with the advantages of perfect accuracy, small expenditure of time, and moderate cash\u2019, and asked that photography be the main means of recording architecture and antiquities (Dewan, p.6).  \n\nAs official photographer to the Madras Government, Tripe set off from Bangalore on 14 December 1857 after delays due to waiting for modifications to his new English camera, and his recovery after falling from a horse. He ended his tour in Madras on 30 April 1858 after travelling via Srirangam, Tiruchchirappalli, Madurai, then Pudukkottai, Tanjore, and Tiruchchirappalli again (then called Seeringham, Trichinopoly, Madura, Poodoocottah and Tanjore). \n\nAll of these areas had been forcefully taken under British rule in the previous one hundred years, but Tripe looked for scenes or subjects with architectural or antiquarian interest rather than political significance. He had wanted to ensure his images were practical too: before he had set out he had asked the chief engineer for guidance on what would be most useful from an engineering perspective, and incorporated this input into his work.",
