The toy was part of the WereBears range, created by artist George Nicholas. The name is an allusion to the very popular toy series Care Bears, by American Greetings, which were ubiquitous in the 1980s. The WereBears were designed to appeal to boys interests in the same way that the Care Bears appealed to girls.\n\nEach bear was sold with his own story tape, narrated by Oliver Postgate. There were four WereBears; Fang (this one), Gums, Grizzler and Howler, with a back-story that told how as ordinary teddy bears they were turned into the WereBears by the light of the full moon. The toy was designed so that its head and paws were reversible, revealing a scary face and claws. Fang's character was the clever one of the group, so before he is reversed into a WereBear, he wears a school cap on his head. Manufacture of the WereBears toys halted in the early 1990s, but interest still prevails, with an attempt at relaunching the characters in 2009.",
