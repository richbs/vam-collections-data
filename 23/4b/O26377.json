The game begins with the discovery of America by Christopher Columbus in 1492, and ends with the Treaty of Independence of 1782. It can be played either historically or topographically.\n\nThere are 36 dated entries in the rules booklet that describe the history of North America and the United States from 1492 to 1782. There is also a list of 38 states and capitals, including six that are Canadian. They were still British possessions at the time of the game.",

These numbers, it will be perceived, are also on the little bits of cardboard under the event.  If the dealer have any one of the same number amongst his cards as turned up, he may place it on the corresponding compartment on the picture, but if he have none of the number turned up, he must pay one counter to the pool.  Should he have two or more of the number turned up, he must only place one, choosing that he thinks most advantageous.\nThe next player on the left hand of the dealer may then proceed in like manner, either placing one of his cards or paying one counter to the pool if he have corresponding numbers, and so on all around the table until a player can complete one of the two outer circles on the picture by covering the last of the eighteen scenes, when he may take the pool and the game is ended.\nIf any one or more of the players part with all their cards without completing a circle, the other players must pay one counter each to him or them.\nThe game becomes very exciting when each of the two circles are very nearly completed, and the number of the players is reduced to two or three.\nA six sided Teetotum may be used instead of the cube if preferred.\n\nTOPOGRAPHICAL VERSION\n\nThe centre of the sheet, it will be perceived, contains the names of the States, with the chief city of each.\nCounters must be distributed in the usual manner.\nThis version of the Game may be played by any number of persons.\nEach player must put two counters into a pool.\nThe cards must be divided and put into a reticule or bag.\nThe first player may draw a card from the bag, on which is printed the name of a city, and if he can tell the state  in which it is situated, he may place it on the corresponding compartment on the sheet; but if he cannot tell, return it to the bag and pay one counter to the pool.  The next player may them proceed in the same manner and so on all round the table.\nThe first player who completes one of the three circles wins the game and may take the pool.\n\n\n*There are 36 dated entries in the booklet describing the history of North America and the United States from 1492 to 1782 and a list of 38 States and capitals including 6 which are Canadian , still English possessions at the time of the game.\n\nRules placement: booklet",
