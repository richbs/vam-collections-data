They has a long period of development. In 1977 director Bill Bryden and his National Theatre acting company presented The Passion, an adaptation by the company and poet Tony Harrison, which dramatised the Easter story. Its success led to a second play in 1980. This, adapted by a number of National Theatre playwrights and eventually named The Nativity, presented the major Old Testament stories and the events surrounding the birth of Jesus. Tony Harrison reworked The Nativity and added a third play, Doomsday. All three plays, now collectively called The Mysteries, were presented at the National Theatre's Cottesloe auditorium in 1985. Together they told the Bible story from the Creation to the Last Judgement.\n\nThe original plays were performed by members of the medieval craft guilds. Bill Bryden and his designer, William Dudley, re-imagined the dramas for the 20th century as if staged by present day working people. Trade union banners, like this one which uses the Biblical image of Adam and Eve, suggested a link between workers past and present. The banners decorated the galleries of the Cottesloe Theatre.",
