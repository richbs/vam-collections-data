Talman was the son of the celebrated architect William Talman. From about 1698 he was employed by his father to help assemble material for his extensive collection of architectural drawings, prints and books. A keen traveller, he went to the Continent twice in search of acquisitions. He visited the northern Netherlands, France, Germany and Italy, and he made numerous watercolour copies of altarpieces and churches in Rome. \n\nTalman was back in England in 1715. He was a founder-member of the Tavern Society, London, which later became the Society of Antiquaries, and he was appointed its first director. Like his father, Talman believed in the elevating purpose of art and in the use of art collections for the public good. Although his will indicates that he had wanted his vast collection (which contained over 32,000 prints and drawings), to go to Trinity College, Cambridge, he later changed his mind and instructed that it should be sold for the benefit of his children. A portion of the collection was nonetheless given outright to the Society of Antiquaries, who acquired further items from the auction in London on 19 April 1727.",

A portfolio with about 300 drawings of churches & c. in Italy by Mr. Tahlman' and with a cancelled inscription ' 25 different designs by Mr. Hauksmoor No.27'.\nIn the catalogue of sale of George Vertue's collection, Lot 1 on the third nigh of the sale (Friday, 18 March 1757) is described in terms almost identical with inscription inside the front cover of this volume including the spelling Tahlman   and two sheets  (E.145, 146- 1940) consist of notes in Vertue's hand. it is therefore a reasonable supposition that the drawings in this volume, and those which resemble them in the other group of drawings nos. E 187-359- 1940, were once in his collection. It is also fo interest, in view of the cancelled inscription, that Lot 3 on the third night of sale consisted in 'Plants and designs in architecture' by Hawksmoor.",
