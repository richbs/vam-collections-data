The name is said to derive from the company Pohlmann & Goppel. Another altogether more romantic story is that of the American, George Hansburg. On his travels in Burma he is reputed to have come across a farmer's daughter who was very devout. She wanted to go to the temple every day but had no shoes and the journey was long, rocky and muddy. The farmer made her a jumping stick so she could bounce her way to pray. The girl's name was Pogo. When Hansburg returned home he made his own version of this jumping stick and added a spring. This was the Pogo Stick that he patented in 1919 and it was taken up by one of the major American department stores of the time, Gimbel Brothers.",
