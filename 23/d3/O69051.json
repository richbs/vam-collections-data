            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nWashstands were included in bedroom suites before the wide-scale introduction of separate bathrooms in British homes in the early 20th century. Large washbowls and water jugs were placed on the top, which was tiled to protect it from water damage.\n\nTrading\nThis was part of a suite sold by Liberty & Co., the London department store founded in 1875.  Liberty's furniture was influenced by Arts and Crafts principles - honest, plain construction and decoration, and the use of solid oak. Liberty's furniture was often made using machines, and some structural and finishing processes were mechanised. Certain furniture ranges were advertised as 'hand-carved', although simpler forms, such as this washstand, were suitable for mechanised production. This kept down costs and made them more affordable than furniture by fine craftsmen, and within the reach of a broad middle-class market. Suites were marketed with names like 'Athelstan' and 'Ethelbert' that evoked 'Old England'.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe heart motif and romantically old-fashioned and rustic design associated Liberty's furniture with the fashionable international art movement Art Nouveau. This was known in Italy as 'Stile Liberty'.  So copied were Liberty's designs that the company protected them with patents. This design was patented in 1894.\n\nPeople\nThe design of this washstand is attributed to Leonard Wyburd, who ran the Liberty design studio. The tiles were supplied by William De Morgan (1839-1917). The washstand was made in the cabinet-making workshop of James Thallon, which Liberty's had bought in 1887.",
