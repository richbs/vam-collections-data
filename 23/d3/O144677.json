In doing so, he laid the foundations of modern photography. Calvert Richard Jones learned of these developments in 1839 through a neighbour, who was a cousin of Talbot. Jones made many pictures in the West of England and South Wales, where he lived. He also travelled widely, making photographs on the continent. Jones' work stands out in the early development of photography because he was one of the first to apply a schooled artist's eye to the medium.\n\nThe Georgian orangery in this photograph was a dramatic centrepiece to the gardens at Margam Abbey. Newly re-built, Margam it was the home of Christopher Rice Mansell Talbot, cousin of Henry Talbot and close friend of Calvert Jones. \nThe classical facade of the building stretches across the photograph, framed at the slightly oblique angle frequently favoured by Jones. Behind, dark foliage accentuates the light colour of stonework. The rooftop urns, the moulded swags and the round-arched windows and the balustrade form a pattern of lines and layers. In the centre foreground, the eye is drawn to a standing figure, while a seated figure on the wide steps is used as a devise to keep the eye inside the frame of the image.",
