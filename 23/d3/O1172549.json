Tin toys cover a vast array of subject matters, although one of the most prominent ones being the subject of space. This subject matter allowed for the manufacturers of such toys to be imaginative and highly creative in their approach to designs. Japan is a prominent manufacturer of such tin toys, taking up every aspect from science fiction to science fact. \n\nJapanese toy ray guns begun to enter the American market in the mid 1950s, generally fashioned of tin and usually thinner and less durable than the American designs. However, the Japanese guns were decorated with imaginative designs which were more sophisticated and interesting than others. This particular gun was made in the 1960s, when Japanese tin toy production was at its peak. Increased labour costs and the demand for die cast models affected the production of tin toys and contributed to its decline in both quality and quantity.",
