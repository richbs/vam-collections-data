It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years. Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nLeon M. Lion was a well-known actor-manager and author who first appeared on the London stage as Midshipman Easy in True Blue at the Olympic Theatre in March 1897. He was very versatile, touring with George Edwardes's company in light opera, and also with Forbes-Robertson's company performing Shakespeare plays. He frequently played roles in the West End as well as producing. The tour of  Cup of Happiness preceded  its London production at the Garrick Theatre in April 1933.",
