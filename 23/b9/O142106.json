High-arched belly in one piece of pine, rising immediately from the edges; triple purfling (bordering) and f-holes with very small top circles. Back of one piece of sycamore or maple, triple purfled, with a repair at the left shoulder. Inside body, thin side linings, canvas strips at the two indentations, and a shallow bass bar. The neck, attached by a nail, is set in line with the belly edges and upon it is a packing wedge which has been reduced in thickness to take the modern finger-board. The scroll, quite well carved, has wide corkscrew spirals projecting each side.
