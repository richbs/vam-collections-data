The figure is first biscuit fired to 1250 \u00b0C then polished and sprayed with clear glaze on the hot biscuit to obtain a very thin coat of glaze, then fired at 1140 \u00b0C. The on-glaze decoration is next. Each colour is built up coat by coat and each coat has to be fired on separately, firstly at 820 \u00b0C and subsequently at 740 \u00b0C.",
