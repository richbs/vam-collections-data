Paolozzi achieved the medium's first masterpiece with his brilliant <i>As is When</i> portfolio (page 59) based on the life and writings of the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein. The series integrated elements from various visual languages-crochet patterns, engineering diagrams, Woolworth's papers-and even went on giving birth to itself when spoils from and earlier sheet in the series were collaged into <i>Wittgenstein the Soldier</i>.",

Green / Techniques  Eduardo Paolozzi assembles collage specifically to provide the first / statement from which stencils are developed by a combination of / photograph and manual separates; he controls all aspects of the work as / handled physically by the Master Printer. The image is built up by multiple / printings through a colour chart, the final statement in each case / varying according to the programme of colour selection. This is possible / only by the use of precision techniques and photo-mechanical aids. / Portfolio  Album  Zaehnsdorf Limited, London / Type  Unwers Bold / Poster and Original Text  The Artist / Publishers  Editions Alecto, London, as portfolios of twelve screen prints in numbered / and signed edition limited to 65 with 12 sets of Artist\u2019s Proofs / [Acknowledgments]\u2019. \nSheet 3: Page of text titled: \u2018Wild Track for Ludwig / The Kakafon Kakkoon Laka con Elektrik Lafs / The first of the four labyrinths [\u2026. ] sufferer. / April 1965 / Set number 51/65 [edition number in pencil]  Eduardo Paolozzi\u2019.\nDims. of box: 101 x 69.5 x 2.5cm.
