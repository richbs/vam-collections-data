This is the second 'Poster Publication' in a projected series (one a year) and it contains work by artists from several countries.\n\nThe publication is not bound: in fact it is more like a portfolio, and it can function as a readymade exhibition. An important aspect of the project is its method of distribution. The edition is allocated to people chosen by the contributing artists, with additional copies exhibited at various sites. The 2002 publication was launched with a display at the Vilma Gold gallery in Rivington Street, London. The remaining copies were distributed to writers, critics, curators, theorists, the participating artists, and others as nominated by the organiser and the artists. The recipients are free to exhibit or distribute all or parts of the set, or to keep it intact. A list of those receiving the publication is included. It is an example of the many ways in which artists (and print publishers) are working outside the conventional gallery system, exploiting new strategies to publish, promote and exhibit their work.",
