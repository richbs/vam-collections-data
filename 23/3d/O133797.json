            "bibliography": "Parkinson, R., Victoria and Albert Museum, <u>Catalogue of British Oil Paintings 1820-1860</u>, London: HMSO, 1990, p. 79\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\"EGLEY, William Maw (1826-1916)\n\nBorn 2 October 1826, son of the miniature painter William Egley (1798-1870). Worked as assistant to his father by the age of 15. Exhibited 34 works at the RA between 1843 and 1898, 18 at the BI 1844-67, and 25 at the SBA 1846-94. Early works mainly subjects from English history, and from literature, particularly Shakespeare and Moli\u00e8re. Influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites in the 1850s, in both technique and subject matter; painted several scenes of modem life, notably 'Omnibus Life in London' (1859, Tate Gallery). Later works are mostly 18th-century costume subjects. Designed one of the first Christmas cards, an etched greeting dated 1848. Friend of W P Frith, for whom he painted backgrounds on occasion. Died Chiswick, London, 20 February 1916. \n\nLIT: W M Egley <i>Catalogue of Pictures</i>. . .

The RA work is no 568 in the artist's <i>Catalogue</i>. In the RA catalogue, several lines of dialogue, in French, were appended to the title; the lines are given in translation in the artist's <i>Catalogue</i>, and are taken from act 2 scene 2 of Moli\u00e8re 's comedy, first performed in 1669: \n\n<i>1st physician</i>: Here's a clever man, one of my brethren, with whom I will consult concerning the manner of our treating you. Now, Sir, take a seat, Sir (the two physicians make M de P sit between them. Each physician takes one of his hands and feels his pulse). \n\n<i>M de P</i>: Your very humble servant. \n\n<i>1st physician</i>: Do you eat well, Sir?\n \n<i>M de P</i>: Yes: and drink still better \n\n<i>1st physician</i>: So much the worse. We will reason upon your affair in your presence; and we will do it in the vulgar tongue, so that you may understand better. \n\nAt the opening of the play, Oronte has arranged a marriage between his daughter Julie and the lawyer Pourceaugnac; she and her lover \u00c9raste try to prevent it by various tricks, and in this episode have persuaded a physician to treat Pourceaugnac for insanity. It is evident that the figure of the Apothecary was originally further to the right; the pentimenti are clearly visible. \n\nThe RA painting was bought by E K Muspratt; its present whereabouts are unknown. Egley painted several scenes from plays by Moli\u00e8re which were popular on the 19th-century London stage; for others in the V &A collections see below. The present subject seems rare: another episode from the same play was exhibited by Gilbert Stuart Newton at the RA in 1824. \n\nPROV: Bought by H S Ashbee 1898, and bequeathed by him to the museum 1900\"",
