            "physical_description": "Female saint, sketch-model in terracotta for a large marble statue. A female saint in a monastic habit is shown holding an open book against her right hip with her right hand. She looks meditatively down towards it and raises her left hand to her heart in a gesture of devotion. Her weight rests on her left leg and her right knee is bent forward so that only the toes of her right foot touch the ground. The left side of her cloak is caught up across the hips by the book, while the right side hangs freely. The drapery is distinctively treated in broad planes which meet at sharp angles, with folds in many cases scalloped out. The effect is of a wood carving technique. The surface is modelled with slight strokes of a modelling-tool giving an effect of hatching, the direction of the strokes varying with that of the different planes to which they are applied. \n\nThe figure has traces of pigmentation, black, red and silver paint being in evidence, and apparently been cleaned rather roughly and possibly at a recent date. There is a severe horizontal break across the figure at the level of the ankles, probably caused by a fall. This damage has been mended with plaster built up on a wire armature behind, to judge from rust-staines and lost portions of terracotta in the area of the crack have been rather incompletely made up in plaster painted brown. Portions of the fingers on the right hand and the edge of the cloak are also missing. The statuette is hollowed out at the back and left in the rough. It has very little depth and is not meant to be viewed from the side, hence is may be regarded as meant for a niche.",
