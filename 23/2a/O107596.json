From July to December 1866, he toured a part of the Himalayan region. He wrote about his journey in The British Journal of Photography, outlining his route and in some cases describing the scenes of which he took photographs.\n\nBourne commented on how the glaciers in the mountains were covered with rocks and boulders. Often, as here, they appeared in odd places such as the middle. He writes: '\u2026these stones could never have fallen so far from the mountains, and especially could not have lodged themselves in such peculiar positions, and must therefore have been carried down by the movement of the glacier itself. In order to give an illustration of this I took a picture when about half-way across, having for a foreground one of the miniature lakes set within its icy walls, some of the curiously lodged stones of which I have spoken, and a background of snowy mountains.\u2019",

            "historical_context_note": "Samuel Bourne wrote and published an account of his journey in which he mentions the places that he photographed. Below is the relevant section for this photograph in which he talks about the way in which the glaciers in these mountains are covered with rocks and boulders, often these are seen in odd places such as the middle of the glacier. \n\n'\u2026these stones could never have fallen so far from the mountains, and especially could not have lodged themselves in such peculiar positions, and must therefore have been carried down by the movement of the glacier itself.\n\nIn order to give and illustration of this I took a picture when about half-way across, having for a foreground one of the miniature lakes set within its icy walls, some of the curiously lodged stones of which I have spoken, and a background of snowy mountains'. \n\nBourne, S, A Photographic journey through the Higher Himalayas, The British Journal of Photography, December 31 1869, pg 629.",
