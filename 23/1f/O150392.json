They made almost any type of ware from clock cases to table wares to jardini\u00e8res. Their most celebrated wares are the sculptural bird-headed tobacco jars. For many years the Martins worked almost exclusively in salt-glazed stoneware which results in the distinctive semi-matt, speckled surface and a limited colour range of browns, blues and greens. They usually added incised decoration and applied ornament.\n\nBetween them, the four Martin brothers formed a full pottery team. Robert Wallace (the eldest), was generally responsible for throwing and modelling, Walter Fraser for decorating and Edwin Bruce for glaze development and kiln management. From the late 1870s Charles ran the brothers' sales from their shop in Brownlow Street, Holborn. However, they did have outside help for both the practical side of the business and and also for designs and modelling from designer Mark V. Marshall and H.F. Fawcett, an artist who had previously worked with William De Morgan. Fawcett designed in the Japanese manner and produced sketches for the brothers which they used for many years.",
