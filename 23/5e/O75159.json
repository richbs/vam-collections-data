The chin is suspended from silk cords, the eyes are held in place by a metal rod to which the cords are attached.

The mask is carved from cypress wood as is the decorative dragon on the top of the mask. The centrally parted hair flows over the top of the head in wavy lines. The back of the mask is framed by stylised cloud scrolls representing the helmet worn by Ryo-O. The eyebrows are raised to form arches over the eyes, which are covered in sheets of gilded metal. The eyes are secured to the inside of the mask by a metal rod, but no longer move freely. The chin is a separate piece of wood suspended from the lower jaw by a red silk cord rather than being connected to the rod for the eyes. This is the more usual method, and is known as tsuriago (dangling chin), whereas this form is more like the kiriago (detached chin) found on other types of Bugaku masks.",
