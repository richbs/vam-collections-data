The decoration is inspired by motifs found on classical antiques and architecture, such as the scroll-shaped feet, the three supporting figures in the shape of grotesque females and the reliefs around the sides depicting cherubs fighting dragons. The dragons have been based on images in bestiaries, books about the behaviour of animals, which were used by Renaissance artists as sources for design.",

Culinary and medical spices from the East were imported by sea and land by Asian merchants, for whom European mercantile centres (such as Alexandria and Damietta in the Levant) were on the fringes of a much bigger Asian trading empire. Although relatively small amounts of spices were imported when compared to other foodstuffs such as grain or salt, they were highly valued in Europe and frequently transported in armed galleys. Pepper, largely sourced from the west coasts of south India and Sri Lanka, represented nearly two thirds of the spices brought into Venice in the 15th century, but ginger, cloves, cinnamon (used for spicing wine, meat and fish) and many other spices were in widespread, if select, use throughout Europe. Although the Venetians enjoyed a monopoly in this lucrative trade for most of the late medieval period, Genoese, French and Spanish merchants were also active. \n\nThis silver spice-stand was probably made around 1540 in C\u00f3rdoba in southern Spain. In the early medieval period the city of C\u00f3rdoba had been the capital of the Caliphate (the Moorish kingdom) in Spain and by the 16th century Spanish cuisine still retained dishes which looked back to its Islamic history. An anonymous 16th century Spanish cookbook called <font -u>Manual de mugeres en el qual se contienen muchas y diversas re\u00e7eutas muy buenas</font> (<font -i>Manual of Women in which is contained many and diverse very good recipes</font>) lists a 'Moorish stew' featuring cloves, cinnamon and caraway. The spice-stand would have been placed on the dining table with each of the three hollows probably containing a different spice (and possibly salt) with which to flavour the diners' food and drink. It is designed in a highly fashionable style for the date, incorporating grotesque creatures and cherubs possibly inspired by antique decorative schemes recently discovered in Italy.",
