There is an inner layer of tissue paper and a paper 'snap' runs through the centre, affixed at each end. Two bands of silver embossed paper are used for embellishment. At the front of the centre section of the cracker is a cut-out paper shape of a black owl sitting on the crescent moon, which is smiling. The cracker has not been pulled so its contents are unknown, but the centre section is reinforced with a tube of cardboard.\n[Compliment slip] Thick cream paper rectangle, folded in two to make a near square folio. The front is printed 'With the compliments of J. F. Edmondson', with a handwritten addition 'Xmas 1922'. This has been folded twice horizontally and twice vertically to make a small square, which was tucked into one end of the cracker.",

Her mother, Amy Piercy, was the youngest of a close family of six sisters so Eileen's early life was busy with visits and entertainments with aunts and cousins. In 1921, when Eileen was six, her father William died in Basra, Iraq, where he was serving in the army.\nEileen and Amy were very close and shared a love of music, dancing and theatre. Eileen also inherited her mother's enthusiasm for collecting; they both held on to birthday and christmas cards, presents, school books, theatrical ephmera and clothing. These ordinary but personally significant objects span the decades when education, cinema, fashion and women's lives were transformed in Britain. \nThe Museum of Childhood now holds this wonderul collection which offers rich insight into the everyday life of a young girl growing up after the First World War.",
