Above the arches are bas-reliefs of Aries, Libra, Cancer, and Capricorn, designed by Goujon. Overall, the design of this fa\u00e7ade synthesises fashionable elements of French traditional style with Italian classicism. The cast was purchased from the Union Centrale des Arts D\u00e9coratifs, Paris in 1884 for 20 francs.",

            "historical_context_note": "The H\u00f4tel Carnavalet, located in the Marais district of Paris, was built in 1544 for Jacques des Ligneris (1480-1566), president of the parliament of Paris and the representative of France at the Council of Trent (1545-1563). The original architect is unknown.  It has been suggested the first campaign of construction was started by Pierre Lescot (c. 1510-1578), who was later called to work on the fa\u00e7ade of the Louvre, and then completed by Jean Bullant (c. 1515-1578) and Jacques I Androuet Du Cerceau (c .1510-1584). Jean Goujon (c.1510-1563/68), who was working at the Louvre, was responsible for designing most of the early decorative reliefs. The second proprietor, Fran\u00e7oise de la Baume-Montrevel, the widow of Fran\u00e7ois de Kernevenoy, a grand seigneur of Brittany, bought the house in 1578. 'Carnavalet' is a bastardisation of the name 'Kernevenoy.'\n\nThis cast is one of four copies of the masks decorating the keystones of the arches of the corps du logis, or loggia separating the court from the interior garden, of the H\u00f4tel Carnavalet. They are attributed to Ponce Jacquiot, a sculptor from the workshop of Goujon, who trained in Italy from 1527 to 1533. Above the arches are bas-reliefs of Aries, Libra, Cancer, and Capricorn, designed by Goujon. Overall, the design of this fa\u00e7ade synthesizes fashionable elements of French traditional style with Italian classicism.",
