Most temples in and around Satrunjaya were destroyed in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.  In the mid-nineteenth century some fragments were retrieved from the area and are now housed in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.  There is no certainty that this frieze comes from a Jain temple, but Jainism is the predominant religion in the region.\n\nMale and female figures alternate in deep recesses between circular columns.  Curiously while the males are dancing vigorously in a variety of postures and gestures, the females stand gracefully.  From the left, the first stands in the <i>svastika</i> posture and holds a pot with both hands, the second stands with her right hip thrust  out and holding a pot with her right hand only, the third strikes  the familiar posture of removing a thorn from her foot as she grasps perhaps a branch with her left arm and the fourth dangles a branch of mangoes with her right hand.   These activities clearly make them <i>alasakanya</i> or indolent girls seen in such provocative abundance in the better known temples of Khajuraho.",
