Francesco in Modena), which was completed in August 1531 for the Franciscan Church of Santa Cecilia in Modena. Both were made of terracotta (literally \u2018cooked earth\u2019). The malleability of clay made it ideal for models, which were then fired to preserve them.\nThis is considered to be the only surviving model which can securely be given to the artist. Begarelli specialised in producing large-scale terracottas in his native Modena, continuing the tradition established by Guido Mazzoni (d. 1518).\nIn this model every aspect of the composition has been represented, and the degree of detail present is taken to a high level. This suggests that Begarelli's model was perhaps presented to the patron for approval.",

It was probably a model presented to the patron for approval. Begarelli specialised in producing large-scale terracottas in his native Modena, continuing the tradition established by Guido Mazzoni (d. 1518).\nIn this model every aspect of the composition has been represented, and the degree of detail present is taken to a high level. This suggests that Begarelli's model was perhaps presented to the patron.",
