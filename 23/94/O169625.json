On acquisition it was believed to be Torrigiano's work. It's history can be traced back to the middle of the 19th century. The base is more in the manner of Pugin than of any of Torregiano's contemporaries'.\n\nPietro Torrigiano (1472-1528) was an Italian sculptor also active in France, the Netherlands, Spain, and perhaps Portugal. He is well known for breaking Michelangelo's nose and he is credited with introducing the Italian Renaissance style to England.",
