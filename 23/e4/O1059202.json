A scratched inscription on the back: <i>1083-/ \u00a316-/ \u00a3100 0-/ [illegible] Hr duke of Glocester /J Hoskins.</i> \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> A Mr Whitehead (probably Jeffery Whitehead, the collector, subsequently a member of the Burlington Fine Arts Club), from whom purchased, 1866 (\u00a326). \n\n<b>Literature:</b> Foster 1903, vol. Il, p. 31 (a 'flat' example of Cooper);Williamson 1904, vol. I, p. 72, pl. XLIII, no. 2 (as Cooper); <i>Catalogue of Miniatures</i>, 1908, p. 8, fig. 13 (as Henry, Duke of Gloucester by Cooper); Foster 1908, p. 314 (as Cooper); Long 1930, p. 13 (\u2018ascription doubtful'); <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 21 (as 'formerly ascribed to' Flatman). \n\nDespite the apparent certainty of the entry in the Catalogue of Miniatures, 1908, this miniature was often omitted from the early literature, though probably only accidentally by Foster from his otherwise undiscriminating lists of 1914-16. In a MS note, probably of the early 1920s, Long wrote:, 'I doubt if this miniature is by Cooper, fine though it is. The background and costume recall in treatment a miniature by or attributed to Hoskins in the Duke of Buccleuch's Collection.' (1) \n\nWhether Long meant to attribute this miniature to Hoskins is doubtful, but certainly his comparison of it with the so-called Maynard was apt; both in style and in the likeness of the sitter, there is a resemblance. But for the Maynard iconography, see Cat. No. 119. \n\nIt was Reynolds who took the final step: 'In my view this is a very good work by Flatman', (2) an attribution that has not been questioned. The phrase 'formerly ascribed to Flatman' in <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981 was a redundant hangover from the miniature's previous placing as a Cooper. \n\nThe identification as Henry, Duke of Gloucester, although given in the <i>Catalogue of Miniatures</i>, 1908, was never accepted by the Museum. Prince Henry (1639/40-1660) was the third son of Charles I and seems to have resembled his brothers strongly, particularly the Duke of York. Of the accepted images of Prince Henry, the closest in date to this miniature are by.Pieter Thyssens at Knole House, in Kent, and a Lely studio picture of him in Garter robes at Euston Hall. \n\n1 I.e., Sir John Maynard. Kennedy 1917, pl. xxxii, there attributed to Samuel Cooper, but probably by Flatman. \n2 MS note, March 1949.\u201d",
