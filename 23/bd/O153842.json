There is a central toothed light pink lozenge infilled with two cross forms - one in light yellow and light brown, the other like stylised trees in white and green.  A palmette form in brown with light blue, yellow and pink details decorates each of the lozenge points.  This motif and its colouring is echoed along each side of the cover, alternating with a toothed lozenge in pink with a blue or green centre. Part [over a quarter] of the central motif is repeated in each of the four corners.  The rest of the field is infilled with angular stems and half palmettes in light yellow or 'golden' yellow, leading from a composite blue angular four-sided form.\nA wide yellow border is on all four sides decorated with a repeat composite extended motif in blue, brown and pink -this may perhaps be a very stylised dragon form.  All the motifs are outlined in dark brown.\nEmbroidery threads: 2S silk; white, dark brown [outlines], light brown, yellow, 'golden' yellow, light blue, blue, green, light yellow, pink, one small area of bright pink,  see reverse for original colours.",
