The quilt has a reverse of cream cotton and is quilted in running stitch in cotton thread in various designs, including 'clamshells' and a star in a circle. The widest border is quilted in a 'running feather' pattern. The quilting also follows the design of the patchwork in other areas. It is wadded with thick wool. There are 1,128 patches in total.",

Take it upstairs, there\u2019s a good gell, an\u2019 let your hair be brushed, an\u2019 put your other pinafore on, an\u2019 change your shoes, do, for shame; an\u2019 come an\u2019 go on with your patchwork, like a little lady.'",
