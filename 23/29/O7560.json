On the either side of the tail is a panel of red, white and blue above the number AV775.  In the underside between the windows is cut a rectangular hole to take a stand.  The stand is missing.\nThe plane is in the RAF Transport Command livery.\n\nIt is likely that this is an Aifix Kit Model, in scale 1:24 or 1:32.
