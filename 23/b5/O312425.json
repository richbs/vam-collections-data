Captain Edward Ross obtained the Queen's prize of \u00a3250 and the gold medal of the Association. The dates 1300-1500 by the side of the archer possibly refer to the period in which the use of the longbow flourished; it was in regular use in the English army from 1285 to 1546. The medal is made by George Gammon Adams. \n\nGeorge Gammon Adams (b. 1821-1898) was a portrait sculptor and medallist. He designed and exhibited prize medals for the Great Exhibition. In 1852 he was chosen to model the death mask of Wellington. One of his public monuments is the 'Napier' statue in Trafalgar square.\n\nThe medal was among the items given to the Museum by I. D. Adams, the daughter of  George Gammon Adams, in 1980. In total, 196 items were included in the Adams gift, which consisted of many models for medals as well as the busts and figurative sculpture. In most instances it is not possible to date conclusively the many models included in this gift.",
