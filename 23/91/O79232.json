These clasps come in a small number of basic shapes of which this one, shaped like a comma, is the most characteristic.  The shape comes originally from India, and is variously described as a mango, almond, cone or Paisley pattern.  \n\nCypriot clasps are part of the general Ottoman tradition, but are often more sophisticated and decorative than those from elsewhere.  The goldsmiths of Cyprus were famous for their filigree although they rarely marked their work.  This clasp was described as 18th century when it was acquired, and this may be true.  It was bought in 1888, just after a terrible famine, when many people had to sell their family heirlooms to survive.",
