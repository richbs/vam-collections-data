It was given to her by her grandmother, who was given it by Prin cess Marguerite Troubetzkoi (niece of Marie Taglioni)  Open and shut with GREAT CARE.  Beware I will haunt in person the Fiend who breaks it.  Margaret Rolfe.\"   The note was enclosed in an enveloped inscribed by Margaret Rolfe:  \"The Parasol of Marie Taglioni.\" \nAlso enclosed in the same envelope was a Christmas card written in Taglioni's hand: \"Un joyeux No\u00ebl ma gentille Marguerite et ch\u00e8re petite \u00e9l\u00e8ve, soyez toujours ma bonne et donne enfant afin d'\u00e9tre  aim\u00e9e de vos parents et bonne de Dieu.  Je vous embrasse de tout coeur Veuve p\u00e9(illeg) Gilbert de Voisins n\u00e9e Taglioni 24 D\u00e9cembre 1879\" \nA collection of Taglioni memorabilia was amassed by Margaret Rolfe, the granddaughter of Taglioni's closest friend in London, Mrs Boggs Rolfe; she attended Taglioni's dancing classes and received many gifts of Taglioni memorabilia, from Taglioni herself, from her grandmother and, after Taglioni's death, from her niece, Marguerite Troubetzkoi.  She kept these, with a series of related notes, in various boxes and annotated envelopes (filed separately).  These she passed to Cyril Beaumont, probably for the London Archives of the Dance (a number of the objects were referred to in \"The London Archives of the Dance and some of its Treasures\" by Cyril Beaumont, Ballet Annual, first issue, Adam & Charles Black, London, 1947, p110); the Archives never achieved an independent home and part of the collection, including the Taglioni memorabilia, was stored with Cyril Beaumont, where it became inextricably mixed with his own collection and came to the Museum as part of the Cyril Beaumont Bequest.",
