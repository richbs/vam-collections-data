            "public_access_description": "Benjamin Turner was one of the first, and remains one of the greatest, British amateur photographers. He began practising photography in 1849 according to the technique patented in 1841 by the British inventor W. H. Fox Talbot (1800-1877). Turner's photographs were 'contact' printed from paper negatives (known as calotypes) of the same size as the print. He printed them on albumen paper, which is paper that has been floated on an emulsion of egg white containing light-sensitive silver salts. Between 1852 and 1854 Turner compiled 60 of his own photographs, including this one, in what is believed to be a unique album, 'Photographic Views from Nature'. It might have been a sample book, a convenient method for presenting photographs for personal pleasure, and for showing to colleagues or potential exhibitors. It remained in the Turner family until it was bought by the Museum.\n\nThis photograph shows the doorway to the circular chapel of St Mary Magdalene that was built within the walls of Ludlow Castle in Shropshire. The chapel dates from the early 12th century. The carved, zig-zag pattern above the arch is typical of the Norman style of architectural design. The Normans of northern France (originally of Scandinavian origin) had invaded and conquered England in 1066, and quickly introduced their style of fortified and ecclesiastical architecture.",
