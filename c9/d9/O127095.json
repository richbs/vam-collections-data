The monument to him and his two wives, surmounted by his coat of arms, was originally in the church of St Denis, Faxton, a hamlet near Lamport in Northamptonshire. The coat of arms and imposing Baroque scrolls indicate the prestige of the family while the inscription refers to Sir Edward's many virtues and his 'continual domestic and hereditary splendour'. The church became redudant in 1939, and was eventually demolished in 1958. The monument however were taken to safety and were given to the Museum in 1965. The collection also includes the tomb of Nicolls' great-nephew of Sir Augustine Nicolls (1559-1616) (Museum no. A.9-1965).",

In the Domesday Book it was a village of thirty-two families. By 1801 the total population was 54. By 1841 it had risen to 108 but by 1921 it was 37. No one lives in the village now. in 1939 services in the church came to an end. Eventually lead was stripped from the roof and in 1958 it was demolished as a 'dangerous structure'. The wall monuments were removed in pieces to the stables of Lamport rectory. In 1965, the Museum agreed to accept the monuments in the rectory stables as a gift. By then they were in poor condition and the reassembly of the monument was laborious and complex. \nThree memorials in Faxton church have not come to the Museum. A plain slabe to Elizabeth Framwell, who died in 1781, has been included in the paving round the base of the column that marks the site of Faxton church. Another simple slab to Susanna Danvers, who died in 1730, daughter of Sir Edward Nicolls, second baronet, has disappeared, although it was photographed by the National Buildings Record in 1945. The monument to Hester Raynsfor, born Isham, who died in 1763, was installed in the Ishal chapel in Lamport church. It was executed by William Cox of Northampton (b. 1717, d. 1793).",
