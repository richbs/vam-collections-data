Tableware designed to accompany drinking related games increased in popularity during the 16th century. The writer Cipriano Piccolpasso described these types of drinking cups as 'unruly vessels'. Drinking and humour were closely related.  The bowl of this example has a central column which connects with six spouts that project from the rim.  The cup also has two handles, one of which is incomplete.  Other examples of puzzle-cups survive, many of which must have been impossible to drink from.",
