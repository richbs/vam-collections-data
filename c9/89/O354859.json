The small roundels on the shoulders and near the lower edge each contain a trefoil leaf with a running wave border.  Down the front of the tunic have been applied four small squares tapestry-woven in purple wool and undyed linen thread.  Each has a bird on either side of a floral stem within a circle, and a running wave border.  A straight slit has been left in the weaving for the neck.  The four purple squares have probably been added since the removal from the grave.",
