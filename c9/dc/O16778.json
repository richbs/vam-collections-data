Maison Laferri\u00e8re was frequented by aristocrats and others of great wealth, who admired its exquisite designs and fine workmanship. Madame Laferri\u00e8re's creations were among those shown by the Collectivit\u00e9 de la Couture at the Universal Exhibition of 1900 held in Paris.\n\nThis dress was worn by Princess Alexandra of Denmark (the future Queen Alexandra), who was considered to dress with exemplary taste. It was given to the Museum by Lady Lloyd and forms part of the Cecil Beaton Collection. This Collection was brought together by the society photographer Sir Cecil Beaton (1904-1980). With great energy and determination, Beaton contacted the well-dressed elite of Europe and North America to help create this lasting monument to the art of dress. The Collection was exhibited in 1971, accompanied by a catalogue that detailed its enormous range.",
