A.51-1911) designed by Stevens for the son of his friend Alfred Pegler, but certain small differences between the plaster and the wax suggest the plaster was not in fact cast from the wax, or that the plaster version was possibly re-worked subsequently.\nStevens designed the cannon for Pegler who wrote to Stannus in 1890: ' The Master designed it for me, long before I had a son or was even married. Years after he promised to finish it for my son...It was made of box wood...the artistic work laid on in plaster of Paris'. The version made for Pegler's son was cast in brass by Hoole and Company in ca. 1865.",
