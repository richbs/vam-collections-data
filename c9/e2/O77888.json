Sets of three, five, seven or even nine vases were known as 'suites of vases' in the 18th and early 19th centuries. They were commonly set out on mantelpieces, with the largest one in the middle, much as today. This piece was made just before vases in the Neo-classical or 'antique' style became enormously fashionable for use in interior decoration. The Staffordshire potter Josiah Wedgwood (1730-1795) was quick to see the commercial potential of this fashion. In 1769, shortly after this piece was made, he boasted of his ambition to become 'Vase Maker General to the Universe'.\n\nMaterials & Making\nBoth the decoration and colour of this vase indicate that it is an early example of Wedgwood's creamware, a type of pottery made from a mixture of clays from South-West England combined with calcined flint. Wedgwood perfected his recipes for glazed creamware in the mid-1760s, when it had the deep cream colour visible here.",
