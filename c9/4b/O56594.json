The jacket has a high stand-up collar and long, straight sleeves. It is tailored in the traditional way (no seams across the shoulders and a vertical seam down the back. The jacket is front fastening jacket with five loop and knot buttons (which are flower shaped) in silver thread. The garment also has two embroidered tapes, each about 28cm long, sewn at either side of the front opening at waist level. These are called <i>zisundai</i> ('offspring bands'). There are short side slits as well as a slit at the back, and the jacket is slightly fitted at the waist. There are darts at the bust and arm level.\n\nAlthough the jacket is made from red satin, this is almost obscured by the gold and silver metallic thread which covers the ground fabric. The design of dragons, phoenixes and flower heads against swirls of silver are all executed in laid couch work. The creatures and flowers are padded and therefore raised up above the swirls. The  couching threads themselves, not only secure down the metallic thread, but are utilised as part of the decoration and are in red, bright green and bright pink. In certain areas, for example the tail feathers of the phoenixes, the red ground is revealed as part of the design.\n\nThe jacket is lined throughout with bright red satin and bound all round the inside edges with a darker red satin.\n\nThere is a machine-woven label in Chinese and English sewn inside the back of the collar.\n[Storage box] Tin storage box for a wedding outfit. It has a separated lid and is decorated with a printed geometrc design in red and gold. Inside the box is another box made from cardboard. This is printed with the name of the supplier.",

The entire surface of the costume is embroidered in couched metallic threads, which would have been eye-catching, drawing attention to the bride. This two-pieced ensemble derives from a traditional form of Chinese dress worn by women during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), but the structured tailoring shows some influence of Western dressmaking. \n\nThe motifs adopted in this costume include dragons and phoenixes, recalling the Chinese greeting \"long feng ji xiang (Dragons and phoenixes bring auspicious favours)\". Also embroidered is the lotus, which is often the symbol of a new marriage.",
