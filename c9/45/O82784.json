White, shows a rough rocky and scrubby landscape filling half the lower part of the picture.

Cook; bequeathed to the Victoria and Albert Museum, through the National Art-Collections Fund.\n\nHistorical significance: General Note on the Gainsborough's transparency box from Hayes, cat. no. 132, p. 497:\n\nGainsborough was familiar with transparency painting, and had himself painted transparencies for the decoration of Bach and Abel's concert rooms in Hanover Square, London, opened in February 1775; but it seems to have been de Loutherbourg's <i>Eidophusikon</i>, first shown in February 1781, which inspired his own 'peep-show' for displaying his ideas for landscapes. Gainsborough's rather amateurish box [which is also in the V&A, museum number P.44-1955, illustrated in Hayes, pls 171, 172] consisted of a large storage space, containing twelve slats, to house his transparencies; a system of cords and pulleys to hoist the desired transparency into position; four slats behind this position, into anyone of which could be inserted a semi-transparent silk screen; and, at the back, five candle-holders. The spectator viewed the transparencies through a large round peep-hole, fitted with a magnifying lens, in the front of the box. The lens could be adjusted to between 25\u00bd and 34\u00bd inches of the projected transparency, thus producing an image with a magnification of between two-and-a-half and five times the size of the original, according to the length of adjustment. The light transmitted from the candles behind, albeit diffused through the silk screen, produced a luminosity close to that in nature impossible to achieve in oil painting on an opaque support. It is not known whether the transparencies were intended to be viewed with the painted surface facing the candle or the spectator; there is optical evidence to favour the former method, but this matter, and others connected with the box, require further investigation. Gainsborough must have painted numerous transparencies for showing in his box, but only ten survive. Two further transparencies in the V&A, P.38-1955 and P.40-1955, were painted by another artist at a later date.",

            "production_note": "This work is one of two glass transparencies added to the 10 in Gainsborough's show-box after its purchase by W. White in 1833.  White may be the amateur painter of this name who exhibited landscapes at the Royal Academy in 1819-21.  It is possible therefore that the two transparencies were painted by White, the amateur painter and owner of the ten original transparencies by Gainsborough.",
