We invited a number of cartoonists to donate works to the museum to form a 'Private Eye collection'. Jon Link and Mick Bunnage, whose work was included in the exhibition, generously presented the museum with this work. \n\nThis drawing has joined the V&A\u2019s large collection of caricatures and satirical prints and drawings which includes work by Hogarth, Rowlandson, Gillray, Cruikshand, John Leech and contemporary artists such as Steadman, Heath, Fantoni and Steve Bell among others.\n\nThe characters that Link and Bunnage have created for their cult comic Modern Toss, and for the Guardian and Private Eye, have been aptly described as \u2018badly-drawn, utterly foul-mouthed, mean spirited and misanthropic\u2026 also very, very funny\u2019.",
