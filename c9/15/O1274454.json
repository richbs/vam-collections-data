The Theatre, which had opened in 1932 as the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, was closed for a major reconstruction between 2007 and 2010, which gave the building a new thrust stage auditorium. improved public and backstage areas, and a 36 metre observation tower.\n\nInfluenced the work of Edward McKnight Kauffer and mid-twentieth century travel posters, Paul Catherall has specialised in the creation of architectural prints, using clean, sharp lines and flat planes of colour to reduce buildings to their essential forms. His depiction of the Royal Shakespeare Theatre. produced entirely by hand, included the iconic swans on the River Avon and the spire of Holy Trinity Church where Shakespeare is buried.",
