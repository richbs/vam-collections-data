A \u2018chandelier\u2019 is literally a \u2018candleholder\u2019, its name deriving from the French for candle: \u2018chandelle\u2019. Chandeliers differ from candelabra in that they are suspended from the ceiling and usually have branch supports for two or more candles or electric lights. \n\nEarly chandeliers evolved from the candle-beam, two pieces of wood nailed together in the form of a cross  with a pricket (spike) at each end. The candles fixed on the prickets were usually of animal fat (tallow), rather than the the more expensive beeswax.\n\nFrom the 15th century, more complex forms of chandeliers based on ring or crown designs became popular in cathedrals and the palaces of the rich. Chandeliers had elaborate running and twisted foliage covering their branches and, in the case of church lights, figures of the Virgin Mary and saints on their central shafts. Such a figure may once have adorned the centre of this chandelier. The candles may not only have provided light to a church or chapel interior but also acted as a shrine to be lit on a saint\u2019s day and offered prayers. \n\nAs a medieval church chandelier this is a rare survivor. Few chandeliers escaped the destruction of the religious struggles of the 16th century.  It is also a rare example of an iron chandelier. At this date, most chandeliers were made of brass which was cast and reproduced in moulds making them cheaper.",

It may be seen as one of those objects which heralded a change in direction in the Museum's collecting activities after the appointment of John Charles Robinson as Curator in 1853. Robinson was a prolific collector and persuaded the Museum's first director, Henry Cole, that historic works of art were as instructive to students as 'modern manufactures'. Under Robinson's guidance, some of the earliest purchases by the Museum included outstanding examples of European metalwork.\n\nHistorical significance: As a medieval church chandelier this is a rare survivor. Few chandeliers escaped the destruction of the religious struggles of the 16th century.  It is also a rare example of an iron chandelier.
