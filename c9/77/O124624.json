            "public_access_description": "Hans Holbein the Younger was regarded as the most important portrait painter in England during the Reformation. He began his career in Basel, where he worked mainly as a painter of altarpieces and designer of woodcuts. He visited England in 1526 to 1528 and through Erasmus, he met Sir Thomas More and his circle. Returning to Basel he received commissions from city authorities and produced designs for stained glass and goldsmiths' work. In 1532 he returned to England, where he worked almost exclusively as a portrait painter, mainly under the patronage of King Henry VIII and his courtiers.\n\nThe original pen and black ink drawing by Hans Holbein the younger is in the \u00d6ffentliche Kunstsammlung Basel and is part of The Passion Series. These ten drawings were Holbein's most famous and most copied designs for stained glass.", 
            "exhibition_history": "", 
            "bibliography": "'Among Hans Holbein the Younger's most famous and most copied designs for stained glass is the series of ten drawings portraying <i>The Passion of Christ</i> in the Kupferstichkabinett, Basel. They served as the bases for offsets, seven of which survive in the British Museum, which were owned by the artist and historiographer Joachim von Sandart (1606-1688), who regarded them as originals and praised them as masterpieces by Holbein in his <i>Teutsche Academie</i>. The Basel drawings are predicated compositionally upon the great <i>Passion Altarpiece</i> (Basel, \u00d6ffentliche Kunstsammlung Basel, inv. no. 315; fig. 99), which Holbein is generally thought to have made around 1525; the drawings were probably made after his return from England around 1528. With their multifigured compositions, rounded, powerfully modeled figures, gravity of expression, and palpable spatiality, <i>The Crucifixion</i> (cat. no. 146) and its companions appear to have been ambitiously conceived by Holbein in the format of a series of framed paintings.'\nButts, Barbara: Painting on Light.
