These passes are normally given to the press, family and close friends of the artist or band. These passes are often much sought after by fans as it allows them to gain entry to the 'behind the scenes' aspects of the show and an opportunity to meet the artist or band.\n\nThe Everly Brothers consist of Isaac Donald Everly and Phillip Everly and are a rock and roll group with strong country music influences, such as close vocal harmonies. As a duo they were active and most successful between 1957 - 1965 and then reunited for a tour in 1983 which was held at the Royal Albert Hall.  They were awarded a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1997 and inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2001.",
