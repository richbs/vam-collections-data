It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years. Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn\u2019t needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nSam Wanamaker, the American director, producer and actor, starred on Broadway in the 1940s and moved to Hollywood to make films, but made England his home in the 1950s after coming to direct and star in Winter Journey with Michael Redgrave. Among his most notable achievements was the building of the Globe Theatre in Southwark.\n\nGoogie Withers, actress and dancer, made her first appearance at the Victoria Palace in 1929 in The Windmill Man.  She has appeared in numerous stage and television productions, as well as in 30 films between 1934 and 1941.\n\nSir Michael Redgrave, actor, director and author, started his acting career in 1934 at the Liverpool Playhouse. He joined the Old Vic Company in 1936 and had a prolific stage and film career, which was recognised by a knighthood in 1959.  Married to actress Rachel Kempson, their three children Vanessa, Lynn and Corin followed in their parents\u2019 profession.",
