Close examination has shown that the inscription was incorrectly restored in the past and formerly gave a date of 1586.  The inside of the lid contains a damaged parchment lining painted with a phoenix.\n\nPeople\nThe jewel was given to Sir Francis Drake (about 1543-1596), the Elizabethan naval hero and explorer. He must have received it before 1591 because in the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, there is a portrait of him wearing it painted in that year. \n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe profile heads of an African man and a European woman make an ingenious use of the brown and white bands of the sardonyx (a variety of quartz). The cameo is one of a number from this period that depict black people. In this case the man is shown wearing a paludamentum, the mantle worn by Roman emperors and generals. Elizabeth may have selected it to show her imperial ambitions. It has been suggested that the male head may represent Saturn, and the female head Astraea, the virgin goddess. The cameo was perhaps intended to proclaim that Elizabeth's reign would be a return to the legendary Age of Gold, when Saturn ruled over a period of peace and prosperity and Astraea distributed blessings.\n\nThe phoenix, painted on parchment inside the lid, was a symbol associated with Elizabeth. According to legend, the phoenix died every 500 years and was reborn from its own ashes. It became a Christian symbol of re-birth and renewal, and symbol of chastity.",
