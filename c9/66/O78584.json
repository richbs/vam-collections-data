This chatelaine is made from polished steel, and the faceted beads which decorate it are riveted through a steel plate - a characteristic of steel work produced in Birmingham.\n\nMaker\nThis chatelaine was made at the Soho Manufactory, Birmingham, of Matthew Boulton (1728-1809) when he was in partnership with John Fothergill (died 1782) and James Watt (1736-1819) between about 1775 to 1800.\n\nManufacture\nBoulton specialised in the production of small attractive wares made in cut and polished steel, such as buttons and chatelaines. He was able to produce them cheaply because he used mass-production methods. For example, large brushes driven by cranks, powered by a water-wheel, were used to polish the steel wares, which in the words of a contemporary commentator 'effected a considerable saving of human labour'.\n\nDesign\nDesigns for chatelaines similar to this one are shown on several plates from the Boulton Pattern Book, now in Birmingham City Library. Some plates are dated 1775, but the general style of the chatelaines suggest they were made closer to 1800. Each individual design is numbered. This example is very close to the design numbered 0453.  A similar chain with a pierced triangular mount at the base is shown as number 0459; the centre is left open, presumably to allow for the setting of a cameo. Josiah Wedgwood (1730-1795) mentions in a letter of 1786 that he has left some cameos with Boulton for mounting in steel. Several Wedgwood Jasper ware cameos mounted in steel survive. The were used on chatelaines, belt buckles and sword hilts.\n\n",
