His products ranged from metal-inlaid furniture to bass viols and English guitars. He was listed  in  Mortimer's Directory  of 1763 as 'Guitar-maker to her Majesty [Queen Charlotte] and the Royal Family'. From about 1500, the bass viol formed part of an ensemble or consort of differently pitched viols, and it enjoyed a brief and final flourish in England during the 1760s. The artist Thomas Gainsborough was an enthusiastic player of the instrument, and Carl Friedrich Abel (d. 1787) delighted London audiences with his 'easy and elegant compositions' and his 'complete and perfect' performances.\n\nOn loan to the Horniman Museum.",
