What in time emerged from the collaboration was Let Us Now Praise Famous Men (1941), a lyric journey to the limits of direct observation and one of the seminal achievements of twentieth-century American letters.  Evans's photographs of the Burroughs family's tidy kitchen are distilled essences of domesticity and recall Agee's comment that everything in the cabin \"might be licked with the tongue and made scarcely cleaner\".
