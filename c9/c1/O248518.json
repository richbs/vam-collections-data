During the 18th century, these types of instruments were often made of boxwood, a hard, close-grained wood well-suited to turning. This example has a straight upper-joint, a characteristic of English oboes made between about 1760 and 1790. The oboe is a reed instrument, developed by Jean Hotteterre (active 1650 - 1690) in France, and the word derives from the French term hautbois, meaning 'loud wood'.",
