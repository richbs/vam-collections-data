The Velvet Grip Boston Garter is widely known because of an advertising promotion in 1912 - baseball cards depicting baseball players including Ty Cobb, Willie Mays and Joe DiMaggio were inserted in Boston Garter sock garters, one per box of twelve. Each lithographed and brightly coloured card shows a player in the locker room, sometimes in his underwear, wearing his sock garters.
