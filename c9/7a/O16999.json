            "public_access_description": "Trollope & Sons, who made this table, were one of the largest and best-known makers of furniture in London during the reign of Queen Victoria (1837\u20131901). The form is based on a sofa-table of the Regency period (about 1810\u201330), but the lavish and intricate decoration in carving and marquetry (inlaid work) is typical of the 1860s. Every detail is crisply finished, and the contrast between different woods is extremely smart. The decoration reflects two historical styles. The overall design of the ornament is in Renaissance Revival style. Some of the details, however, such as the small, square panels of quatrefoil at either end of the frieze, would not have been out of place on a Gothic Revival piece.\n\nCommercial cabinetmakers such as Trollope adapted designs for the many different revival styles that were in fashion at the time. They were quick to spot possibilities. The firm must have been proud of this model of table, because they showed a very similar example at the Paris International Exhibition of 1867.",
