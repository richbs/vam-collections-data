His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nDer Rosenkavalier, an opera by Richard Strauss (1909-1910), was mounted at Glyndebourne in 1959 in tribute to Carl Ebert, who retired that year after 25 years as the director of Glyndebourne.  The production received criticism for the small stage overcrowded with performers and scenery.  Set in Vienna during the eighteenth century reign of Empress Maria Theresa, Messel created a lavish rococo fantasy.  This was his last production for Glyndebourne.\n\nMartin Cooper, the Daily Telegraph critic, found Messel\u2019s set for an inn full of disreputable characters in Act III charming.   However, for the Observer critic Edmund Tracey, the pastel yellow, blues and pinks were too pallid and lacking in personality, and he thought that the set made ineffective use of the small Glyndebourne stage.",

Oliver Messel\u2019s production was first performed by the Glyndebourne Festival Opera at Glyndebourne on 28 May, 1959.  It was directed by Carl Ebert and featured Elisabeth S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m as Octavian, Regine Crespin as the Marschallin and Anneliese Rothenberger as Sophie.  It was revived at Glyndebourne in 1960 and 1965. This was Messel\u2019s last production for Glyndebourne.  \nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's theatre designs and other designs and artefacts.  The designs were briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being housed at the V&A from 1981 on indefinite loan.  The V&A Theatre Museum purchased the Oliver Messel collection from Lord Snowdon in 2005.\n\nHistorical significance: Messel worked for Glyndebourne from 1951 to 1959, when he was at the height of his popularity as a designer for the stage.  His work for Glyndebourne in this period is regarded as some of his best designs.",
