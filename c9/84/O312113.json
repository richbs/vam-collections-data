Beneath is a male sea deity. The opposite face shows a Nereid riding a sea monster. At the front of the ewer beneath the lip is a child with a double fish tail holding a shell. At the back the handle assumes the form of an aged sea-god, whose arms are bent back towards the neck of the vessel. One of his double fish tails is clasped by a child triton with a horn beneath. The neck of the ewer is not figurated. The lid, which is cast separately from the remainder of the work, is screwed into the place with a simple circular knob.",

A.18-1959) of highly ornamented and purely ornamental ewers made for Senator Giovanni Battista Scarlatti by Massimiliano Soldani, re Soldani's post in the Medici court, the most renowned worker in bronze in Florence in the late baroque period. \nHugh Honour noted that Sir Horace Mann (1701-86), the British consul in Florence, was negotiating for the purchase of some Soldani bronzes for George Bubb Doddington in 1759, and suggested that these could be the ones currently in the Victoria and Albert Museum.\n\nCharles Avery has recently discovered references to the ewers in Soldani's correspondence, some of which is in the Bodleian Library, Oxford. In 1722 Soldani evidently offered to cast further bronze versions for Senator Scarlatti, and in 1732 made the same suggestion to an Italian merchant resident in London, Giovanni Giacomo Zamboni (1683-1753). However it seems unlikely these were ever made (I am grateful to Charles Avery for this information). \n\nThe ewers were cast from wax models, and the moulds used in this process were later employed to create ceramic examples in coloured Doccia porcelain. Examples of these Doccia porcelain versions are now in the Museo Civico, Turin.",
