The modern Portuguese guitar is descended from this type of instrument. Although it was made in about 1780 or later, this instrument was slightly more old-fashioned in that it was plucked with nails rather than struck with keys, and tuned with wooden pegs rather than small bolts that were turned by a watch-key. This English guitar was made by Joseph Rudiman (1733\u20131810), widely regarded as the best Scotch violin and cello maker of his day.",
