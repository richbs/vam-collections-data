It was intended to be used for the casting of bronze plaquettes which would reproduce in relief the original image in the rock crystal.  Plaquettes are small plaques made of bronze, brass, lead or precious metals. They originated in the 1440s with the desire to reproduce coins and hardstone engravings from ancient Greece and Rome. Some were made as collector\u2019s pieces, to be viewed and displayed in private, and others for practical or devotional purposes, such as decorations for caskets,ink-stands and paxes. This mould was made from a rock crystal plaque that formed part of Valerio Belli's masterpiece, a casket with 24 scenes from the life of Christ, completed for Pope Clement VII in 1537. Most of Belli\u2019s plaquettes were based on his hardstone engravings. However, the existence of matrices suggests that he may have made designs specially for reproduction.",
