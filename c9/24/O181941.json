A Guild or Fraternity of Jesus was established at Prittlewell in 1468, and the lands held by the Guild were called 'Reynoldes', probably after the original owner. The dissolution of the Priory took place in 1536, and it is possible that this fireplace and tracery, together with museum number 455-1906, were removed during this period, and subsequently boarded up in 'Reynoldes' where they were discovered in 1906. According to Keating Clay's account of Prittlewell Priory, it is likely that the fireplace came from the Priory refectory and the reredos from the Priory Church. These were evidently removed during the destruction of the monastery and placed in a private house.",

            "historical_context_note": "This fireplace and another fireplace (museum number 455-1906) were originally part of the High Altar of the Priory Church, Prittlewell. \n\nPrittlewell Priory was founded between 1086 and 1121 by Robert de Essex, Lord of the Manor of Rayleigh. A Guild or Fraternity of Jesus was established at Prittlewell in 1468, and the lands held by the Guild were called 'Reynoldes', probably after the original owner. The dissolution of the Priory took place in 1536, and it is possible that this fireplace and tracery, together with museum number 455-1906, were removed during this period, and subsequently boarded up in 'Reynoldes' where they were discovered in 1906. According to Keating Clay's account of Prittlewell Priory, it is likely that the fireplace came from the Priory refectory and the reredos from the Priory Church. These were evidently removed during the destruction of the monastery and placed in a private house.",
