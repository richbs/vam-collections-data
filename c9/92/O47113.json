At the centre front is appliqu\u00e9d a large cotton satin circle on which is printed an image of the head and shoulders of the clown, Charlie Keith, wearing his makeup and costume with the word, 'Keith', printed on his neck frill. Heart shapes in red wool fabric are appliqu\u00e9d on his cheeks and forehead, a red wool fabric crescent is appliqu\u00e9d on his lower lip and the neck frill is outlined in similar fabric. The edges of the circle are covered with shaped machine embroidered floral garland braid in magenta, clear and light blue, various shades of green and touches of pink and white. This image and roundel is repeated on the back of the jerkin, bisected by the back opening. Beneath the front roundel are appliqu\u00e9d the letters, 'CHARLIE', in black cotton satin, with, on the back, the letters 'KEI' on one side of the opening and 'TH' on the other\nOn the neck frill are spaced seven rings in pale blue cotton and towards the edge of the frill is a line of scarlet cotton braid. The two scalloped frills at the lower edge are pleated between each scallop and are each set with a similar ring. To the front of each sleeve is appliqu\u00e9d a bold embroidered floral motif of poppies and leaves and to the back is a similar single large embroidered flower with buds, both motifs surrounded by embroidered appliqu\u00e9d buds. The embroidery is all in heavy wools. The costume fastens down the back with hooks and hand stitched eyelets pierced through the cotton.",
