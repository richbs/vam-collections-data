In the Middle Ages and later they were believed to have miraculous powers and were greatly venerated. \n\nThe relics were kept in special containers, called reliquaries, whose costly materials and beautiful workmanship reflected the importance of their contents. The relics themselves are occasionally visible, set beneath crystal windows and wrapped in a parchment tag with the name of the saint. Cathedrals and major churches accumulated reliquaries and displayed them on or near the high altar on major holy days.\n\nThis casket probably contained relics of the saints depicted on it. Most prominent is St George, patron of England, on the lid. On the sides are other English saints, including St Etheldreda of Ely with sceptre and church. This original decoration was later obscured when small figures of other saints were added. These are shown separately beside the casket.",

In the Middle Ages and later they were credited with miraculous powers and much venerated. They were kept in secure containers called reliquaries, whose costly materials and beautiful workmanship reflected the importance of their contents. The relics themselves are occasionally visible, set beneath crystal windows and sometimes wrapped in a parchment tag inscribed with the name of the saint. \n\nReliquaries were made in many forms. Some are modelled in the shape of the relic itself but most are box-shaped or of architectural form. The costliest are of gold and silver, embellished with precious stones, though many are of gilded and enamelled copper, decorated with scenes from the life of the saint. Cathedrals and major churches accumulated large collections of reliquaries, which were formally displayed near the high altar on major feast-days.  Most of those in museum collections no longer contain their relics.",
