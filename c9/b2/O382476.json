The surface of the inkstand sweeps upwards from all four sides to form a rectangular receptacle for the inkwell.  The inside walls of this receptacle slope inwards towards a square base.  It is covered by a square lid, slightly domed with rounded edges, hinged along the back and embellished by two, small raised squares, half way down the edge of each side.  The handle is a small square section of metal aligned along the central axis of the lid and lying parallel with the leading edge.  A rectangular section is cut out of the base of the handle, the top edge is embellished with three raised squares in a row on either side. The inkwell, of pressed glass, follows the shape of the receptacle and has a circular aperture in the top.  Three impressed squares are arranged in a straight line he front of the tray.  Otherwise, the decoration consists of stamped squares containing interlaced curves on the two corners of the front of the inkwell and at the two rear corners of the tray.  An incised line runs around the inside of the edge and then sweeps upwards towards the hinged edge of the lid, either side of the `prow' at the back.  The front edge of the tray is cambered upwards to provide a gully for the pens.  The inkstand rests on six feet which are extent ions of the rim; at every corner and in the centre of the front and rear edges.",
