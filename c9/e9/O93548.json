It was woven in the lampas technique, in which two distinct types of weave (satin and twill) were combined using a drawloom, which had two sets of warps and wefts and a mechanism for creating the pattern, operated by a second weaver, called the drawboy. \n\nThe pattern consists of two equally balanced elements: the roughly oval medallions set in staggered rows and the undulating framework that runs between them. The framework is sometimes called an \u2018ogival lattice\u2019 since it can be seen as a series of ogival (that is, pointed) arches. The outline of the medallions is formed by feathery leaves, while their centres are filled with a symmetrical pattern of arabesque scrollwork \u2013 rumi. The outline of the lattice is formed by smaller, simpler leaves, and it is filled with trails of fantastic blossoms \u2013 hatayi \u2013 punctuated by an equally fantastic pomegranate motif.\n\nThe origins of many of these design elements can be detected in both Iranian and Italian weaving of 1400\u20131500, but their combination here is distinctive of Turkish production around 1500\u20131600. During this time, great quantities of luxury silks of this type were woven in Turkey, both for domestic consumption and for export. The main silk weaving centre was Bursa, the first capital of the sultans of the Ottoman dynasty (about 1300\u20131924), located in north-western Turkey.",
