The series of six images tells the story of \u2018Hackabout Moll\u2019, the simple country girl drawn into prostitution following her arrival in the city. In this image \u2013 plate four \u2013 Moll is in London's Bridewell prison, being punished by being forced to beat hemp to make rope. She wears much finer clothes than the other female prisoners (Hogarth may have drawn on a contemporary newspaper report of a prostitute in prison 'beating hemp in a gown very richly laced with silver'), for which she is ridiculed by a woman \u2013 another prisoner or the gaoler\u2019s wife \u2013 standing over her. Next to the harlot is a well-dressed older man. The playing-cards on the ground indicate that he has lost his money through gambling. In the background is a black woman beating hemp. Her presence in the picture may be intended as a reminder that at this time prostitutes in Britain could face transportation to the colonies as punishment.",

The black woman\u2019s presence moreover serves to indicate the future of some of the white prostitutes: many of them will be transported to the colonies where their condition will be little different from that of the black slave\u2019s, in terms of sexual and economic exploitation \u2026. The black woman\u2019s pregnancy, suggested by her plumpness, weariness and by the way her hand presses the handle of the mallet \u2013 the instrument of labour \u2013 to the top of her belly) is a poignant symbol of such dual exploitation for Hogarth would have known, from friends who had experiences of colonial affairs, or from printed sources \u2026 of the enhanced economic value of pregnant slavewomen in the colonies.\u2019",
