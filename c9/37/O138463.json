The complete outfit consisted of this black felt porkpie hat; a customised Harrington cotton jacket; a Fred Perry cotton t-shirt; Brutus Sta Press cotton trousers; leather loafers and Ray-ban \u2018Wayfarer\u2019 sun-glasses. The outfit reflected a style of men\u2019s dress associated with the Two Tone ska revival in Britain in the late 1970s.\n\nThe roots of Two Tone lay in Jamaican Rude Boy culture which had its origins in the ghettos of Kingston. Young, urban and frequently unemployed, Rude Boys drew inspiration for their cool and smart style \u2013 sharp suits, thin ties and pork-pie or Trilby hats \u2013 from American gangster movies. In the 1960s, increased emigration brought Rude Boy style and music, ska and rocksteady, to the UK, where it particularly influenced Skinhead culture. In the late 1970s the style was revived through the music and fans of the Two Tone ska revival. The sharp tailoring remained and was emphasised through a predominantly black and white palette.",
