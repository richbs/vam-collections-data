The linear treatment of the figures is emblematical of Daumier\u2019s vigorous style, and reminiscent of his caricatures for the satirical journal <i>Le Charivari</i>. \n\nThese three gossiping women are drawn with an accurate realism. We can imagine that the woman on the right side just learnt of a \u2018crucial\u2019 information she wants to share with her friends. The two other women obviously overreact in their own way: showing a very surprising face or praying in a desperate attitude. The gravity of the situation is grown by the clenched gesture of the main character. The dramatic atmosphere is clearly inspired by the theatre. \n\nTwo other versions of the same composition can be found: one in a private collection, Chicago (see Maison 694); and another of whereabouts unknown (see Maison 696). A  watercolour shows a full-length version of the <i>Trois Comm\u00e8res</i> set in a dark staircase (M. Georges Encil collection, Montreal \u2013 Maison 697). According to the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France, all these drawings have been realised as a <i>reprise</i> of the 1852 lithograph published in the series <i>Actualit\u00e9s</i> (sheet 277) of <i>Le Charivari</i>. This engraving represents three women in a staircase talking about the recent earthquake in Bordeaux. \nHowever, another lithograph published in <i>Le Charivari</i> entitled <i>La Com\u00e8te de 1857</i> (ill. 2925 in <i>Le Peintre-Graveur, Honor\u00e9 Daumier</i> by Loys Delteil) seems to resume exactly the same expressions as in the V&A <i>comm\u00e8res</i>, which could be in fact a preparatory sketch for this late engraving. In this regard, the present drawing could dated in the late 1850s.\n\nDaumier was most celebrated during his life time for his satirical and anti-monarchist illustrations rather than his paintings and drawings. This sheet is a good example of Daumier\u2019s observation of the French society and social classes. It focuses on his observation and interest for theatrical production. He did a few series of sketches focusing on different categories such as musicians, comedians, art collectors, rustic life, saltimbanques\u2026",
