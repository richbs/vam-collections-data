The 'window' of the cab is a sheet of clear plastic. One headlamp; mounted on the left wheel cover is a lozenge shape of wood painted green with the 'lamp' itself a large metal stud. The right headlamp is missing. The steering wheel is a disc of wood painted red. The dumper at the back is wood with a hardboard bottom; painted red. It is mounted on a wooden pivot which allows it to be raised by pressing down a metal lever on the right side behind the cab. The end of the lever is covered by a ball of wood; painted yellow; and the lever extends under the dumper to form a hook shape. The whole is mounted on four wheels of wood painted green with metal axles. On the bumper beneath the grooves cut into the bonnet front representing the radiator is printed a red circle and the words CHAD VALLEY in black. Under the cab are pencil marks which appear to be 9 and the letter a.",
