The lapis lazuli backing of this ivory group may be later; it is rare to see ivory combined with lapis lazuli. The sarcophagus could well be a modern addition as well. The composition, even though probably missing some figures, is likely to depend from an Italian source, almost certainly an engraving. It is Italianate in style, however the facial features, especially those of the standing angel, suggest it is more likely to be South German. The flowing drapery and attenuated forms indicate it is in late Mannerist style of the early seventeenth century.\nThe subject, an Imago Pietatis, was frequently depicted in painting and sculpture as part of the Passion of Christ.",
