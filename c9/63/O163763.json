Painted and varnished wood was often used in place of true papier mache from the later 19th century onwards, but the finest work was produced by building up layers of moistened paper in a mould to the required shape, which was then smoothed, painted and varnished.\nThis water vessel was transferred to the South Kensington Museum (now V&A) from the India Museum in London in 1879 when the latter museum's collections were dispersed. The vessel had been acquired by the India Museum in 1867 and was presumably shown in the Paris Universal Exhibition of that year as a fine example of India's decorative arts.",
