She required an extensive wardrobe for the many formal dinners and state functions that she had to attend.\n\nLady Alexandra dressed exclusively at the house of Jacques Fath (1912-54), and commissioned this dress from him in 1950.  In 1971, when she donated many of her Fath dresses and hats to the V&A, she told Cecil Beaton: 'I can date the grey dress and the white taffeta evening dress exactly because I had them when I was expecting my youngest child.  He is now exactly 21.  The dresses were not altered in any way except that they could be let out.  Afterwards (my son was born at the end of Sept 1950) they were altered by Fath to fit my normal size'.  \n\nCouture garments were expected to last many years due to the quality of their materials and their skilled construction. Part of the service provided by the couturier for his client was a personalised alteration and repair service.  It was common for couture clients to take suits back to be relined after years of wear, or to have hems taken up with changing fashions.",

In the Beaton Registered Files (part F/5), Lady Alexandra writes (Nov 13 1971) that Fath altered the dress during her pregnancy and then again after the birth of her son.  It is possible that this dress was an an original 'model' dress, as Lady Alexandra was exactly the same size as some of Fath's house models, she would sometimes purchase these original versions to wear, and she writes:\n\"the dresses were not altered in any way except that they could be let out\".\n\nIn the same letter, she recalls that the dress was originally adorned with a large silk rose, which she subsequently lost.  She writes that she removed a rose from another of her dresses, T.177-1974, and placed it with this dress.\n\nThe hat, which was incorrectly numbered as part of this ensemble, was worn with T.176-1974 as per Lady Alexandra's (5 Nov 1971) letter in the Beaton registered papers which contextualises is with the blue white-spot day dress and not this white blue/black-spot evening dress:\n\"A box of Jacques Fath day dresses - 1. mauve crepe, 2. yellow cotton with sash, 3. blue and white spot foulard, 4. green and black print on white... I have also found verious hats which I am also leaving.  The large white Jacques Fath (boat shaped) was the one I wore with the blue and white spot dress.
