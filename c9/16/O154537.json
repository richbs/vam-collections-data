            "physical_description": "Coat of block-printed plain weave cotton, and lined with block-printed cotton. Lightly padded and quilted with cuff facings of block-printed cotton. The back has a central vertical panel and attached side panels to create flare. These are joined at waist level. The front of the coat is made in a similar manner. There are shoulder seams and the sleeves are attached at right angles to the main panel. The sleeves are not seamed but hang open from the shoulders. The sides are seamed only from the waist to just below the armpit.\n\nThe main fabric is a fine white cotton decorated in a striped arrangement of four patterns: a delicate meander with stylised rose buds, a wider stripe of floral motifs, a stripe containing small diagonal ovals containing a floral sprig and set onto a white ground cross-hatched in red, and a wider strip of large ovals edged in black and red containing three red flower heads and blue leaves. Colours: red, blue, black and touches of yellow.\n\nThe lining has a coarse cream ground decorated with overall ogival lattice containing stylised flower heads. Colours: black and red with grey. Very crudely printed. There are three small sections of the lining from other fabrics: these are on the right side and two are from the same fabric. This is a roller-printed cotton in red, green and brown-beige in imitation of ikat and may be from Central Asia (possibly Uzbekistan). The third piece is a roller-printed cotton with small floral elements in two shades of red and green on a yellow ground. The facing on both cuffs is a block-printed fine cotton very similar to the main fabric, the difference being in scale and the addition of a pair of inward curving leaves between the oval shapes in the border. The quilting is worked in vertical lines with light brown thread.",
