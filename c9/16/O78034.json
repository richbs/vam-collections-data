Many thousands of plates of this general type were made by many British potteries in the early 19th century.\n\nDesign & Designing\nHaving exhausted the possibilities of making direct copies of Chinese porcelains, engravers making copper-plates specifically for the pottery trade began to turn to invention. If pagoda-like temples from China were exotic, then so were palm-trees from the Middle East. Such muddled designs were never intended to be studied, as they now are by ardent collectors.\n\nTime\nWhen this plate was made, it was about 40 years since the first expensive English blue and white porcelain tablewares had been made at Worcester. With the advent of the taste for the more austere Neo-classicism at the end of the 18th century, makers of fashionable porcelains abandoned Chinese-type decoration and instead began to copy French styles. At the same time, partly to replace the defunct manufacture of delftware, transfer-printing in blue was applied to cheap earthenware for the mass market. By 1800, the style that in the 1770s the wealthy had considered the latest fashion was given a new - and much longer - lease of life lower down the social scale.",
