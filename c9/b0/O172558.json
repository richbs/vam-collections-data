He is best knownfor these later works, but earlier works, like this lithograph - one of a group of four made in 1939 - suggest he was energetically experimenting with form and a technique of 'drawing' of a more spontaneous nature, which may relate to the surrealist technique of automatic writing. At this time Albers was teaching at Black Mountain College in Carolina, but also making trips to Mexico, which he found very inspiring.",
