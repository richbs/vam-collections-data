This was the first major exhibition of Mackintosh's work, instigated by Robert Hurd, Architect, of Edinburgh, who invited Thomas Howarth (author of Charles Rennie Mackintosh and the Modern Movement, 1952) to put on an exhibition during the 1953 Edinburgh International Festival. He persuaded the President and Council of the Salter Society to house it in Gladstone's Land, a 17th century town house in the Royal Mile, and the exhibition was financially underwritten by the Arts Council. This was an important exhibition, including works drawn from the V&A's collections, as well as models made by architectural students in Manchester and Glasgow.",
