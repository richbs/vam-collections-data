Fostat eventually became used as a rubbish disposal area for Cairo, which is no doubt how so many textile fragments ended up there. Some of the so-called Fostat fragments have been Carbon-14 dated to as early as the 10th century, but most are considerably later. \n\nThis one probably dates from the 15th to 16th century. The Fostat finds (and those from other Egyptian sites such as Quseir al-Qadim) may not be very glamorous, but they provide tangible evidence for the immensely important trade in cotton textiles from India to the Mediterranean world in the medieval period. We know from written sources that the trade is many centuries older than that, but these are the earliest surviving actual textiles from that sector of the Indian textile trade.",
