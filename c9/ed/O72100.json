Takauchi lives and works in Mashiko, the pottery centre in Tochigi Prefecture to the north-east of Tokyo made famous by Hamada Shoji. Takauchi's exploration of the Oribe aesthetic is a relatively rare instance of a contemporary artist from one region working in a style closely associated with another. The recent emergence of figures like Takauchi who ignore the barriers of regionalism is a reversion to the pattern found in the early days of Japanese studio ceramics in the first half of the twentieth century.",
