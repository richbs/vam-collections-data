Jonathan Miller used the setting in his opera, making the 'Duke' a Mafia Boss, and Rigoletto a barman. \n\nThis production, a revival of the production which was first seen at the Coliseum, 22 September 1982, is an innovative Jonathan Miller, typical of the updating techniques used at the Coliseum in the 1980s which aimed to make the opera more accessible, at the risk of alienating traditional opera fans.  The Theatre Museum has a model for one of the scenes in this production, acquired separately.",
