            "public_access_description": "This fine 12-sided candlestick has a complex shape. It was probably inspired by a candlestick made of silver, which is easier to work than brass. The socket for the candle is a miniature version of the base, which has a central boss on each of its 12 sides. These are matched by the 12 roundels on the drip-tray.\n\nIn Islamic art, objects made from base materials were often transformed by sophisticated forms of decoration. Brassware, like this piece, was often decorated with inlaid surface ornament.\n\nFor larger motifs, metalworkers chiselled out small areas of brass and filled them with thin sheets of silver, gold and copper. They added details by chasing the surface of the softer metals and contrast by using a black filler. \n\nThe inlay technique first became popular in eastern Iran in the mid 12th century. It then spread westwards and by 1250 was in use across the Middle East. Its popularity declined after 1500. This candlestick was made when the technique was at its peak.",
