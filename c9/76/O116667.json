This pattern, called a Lazo in Spanish, and a La\u00e7a in Portuguese (both meaning a bow of ribbon), was one of the most fashionable designs until well into the 18th century, and continued in use with traditional costume up to the early 20th century. \n\nThis piece was described as Spanish or Portuguese when it was acquired by the Museum in 1893, but it is most likely to be Portuguese.  The bar over the loop at the bottom of the bow is characteristic of Portuguese La\u00e7a pendants of the 18th century.",
