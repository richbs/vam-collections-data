The mouth is an upwardly curved shape of red felt sewn to the face; it has a black line sewn through the middle to indicate the lips.  The eyes are white plastic discs with smaller black disc glued on.  The hair is black nylon wool stitched in a band across the top of the head and feathered upwards; the back of the head is bare.  The upper body and arms are of turquoise felt designed to represent a tailed jacket.  The front chest is yellow velveteen with a single red line stitched down the front.  The hands are stitched to indicate fingers and separate thumbs.  The legs are of black and white striped cotton shaped and stuffed to represent trousers with the upper feet of white brushed cotton representing spats.  At the neck is sewn a bow tie of black and white striped cotton.\n\n*Merrythought introduced Golly in 1959 and continues to produce them.  One design represented the singers from a television variety show called the Black and White Minstrels.  These had the striped trousers and tie with a matching top hat but `wore' white gloves.  \n\n*This version contains a rattle in  the body and is probably from the mid to late 1960s, possibly the 1970s.",
