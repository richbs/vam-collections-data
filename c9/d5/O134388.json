Early prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of William Etty, studied at Sass's art school, and entered RA Schools 1829 (won several prizes, including Gold Medal 1839). Won Gold Medal at Society of Arts 1833/4, and a prize in Westminster Hall fresco competition 1843. ARA 1846, RA 1870, honorary retired RA 1876. Exhibited 77 works at the RA between 1836 and 1878, 33 at the BI 1842-67, and two watercolours at the SBA in 1871 and 1875. Early works mainly portraits, then mythological and allegorical subjects usually involving female nudes sometimes in great numbers. Many of his works were engraved; there are eight in the V&A collections, and also several drawings. Redgrave (<i>Cent</i>) wrote that his female figures had 'none of the vigour of those by Etty, though they have a chaste and graceful character'. Died Fitzroy Square, London, 4 June 1877; his studio sale was at Christie's 14-16 March 1878.\n\n<b>Three Female Life Studies</b> \n1411-1873, 1412-1873, 1413-1873 Negs HJ590, HJ591, HE4969 \nMillboard, 53.5 x 43 cm (21 1/16 x 16 15/16 ins), 46.4 x 36.4 cm (18\u00bc x 14 3/8 ins), 43.2 x 52.7 cm (17 x 20\u00be ins) max \nPurchased 1873 \n\n1413-1873 is inscribed at the left 'HOWARD- Visitor-/March. 1842/No 13' (in ink, except for the word 'Visitor' which is in pencil); this is presumably Henry Howard RA (1769-1849), who was Professor of Painting at the RA from 1833. It is interesting to see Frost, like his mentor Etty, continuing to study from the nude in the Life School. 1412-1873 has no inscription, but 1411-1873 is inscribed at top right '1843 Oct[ober]-/Leslie [presumably C R Leslie RA] visitor [as above, written in pencil] No 2-[or possibly 1]. \n\nENGR: (1411-1873) chromolithograph by a student of the London College of Printing and the Graphic Arts c1930 (20 proofs and the final state, in the V&A collections E255-275-1954)\"",
