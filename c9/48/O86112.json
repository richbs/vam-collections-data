The Buddha lies on the couch on his right side with his head propped up on his right hand.  He has nimbus and his hair is drawn back in long waves.   On the floor near the bed sits Subhadra, the Buddha's last disciple, sunk in meditation.His tripod and water gourd  is next to him.  On the left stands Vajrapani, under a sala tree, holding the thunderbolt in his left hand.  At the foot of the bed stands the monk Mahakasyapa, touching one of the Buddha's feet.   Behind the Buddha  three of the Malla princes are shown in various postures of grief.",
