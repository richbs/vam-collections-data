Casanovas received the commission for the memorial in 2004, having won a competition to create a monument against Fascism for the city of Olot in Catalonia. \n\nThe works in the series are strongly geological in feel, evoking fissured stone and rock. They were formed from large blocks of clay that Casanovas froze before dropping to partly shatter their structure.\n\nIn addition to those exhibitions specifically listed, this work was shown at the New Art Centre, Roche Court, Wiltshire during 2005-06. \n\n<i>Ermit\u00f2</i> was acquired by the Museum following the art fair Collect 2010, at which the related work <i>Ermit\u00f2 de Sant Sebasti\u00e0 </i>(2003-4) was shown by Galerie Besson.",
