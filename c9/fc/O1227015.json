They also had the leisure time to devote to such artistic pursuits, developing the skills required to make complex ornaments, to decorate fernery grottoes attached to the house and small domestic objects, such as boxes, tea caddies and tables.\n\nThis shell collection was most likely formed in about 1800 by an amateur practitioner of shell-work, and complements the shell-work ornaments in the V&A Collection. The shells were probably bought from a specialist shop and appear to remain in their original small containers. They include made-up sprays of flowers on wires, and a box of miniature vegetables made from tiny shells and wire. The mahogany box in which they are stored is unlabelled and may not have been designed specifically to hold shells.\n\nShells were being imported into Britain in large quantities in the late 18th century, and could be bought from specialist shops such as 'Mr Castle's Grotto' in London. Other materials, such as wooden vases and basket shapes, were supplied by cabinet-makers. It was usual for ladies to store their shells in partitioned wooden boxes. This was a practical way of organising colours and varieties ready for use.",
