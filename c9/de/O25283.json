The two children were given medals for their \" daring and clever performances on the trapeze\" . This medal was probably presented by an admirer. In a photograph taken in about 1893, Fred can be seen wearing a similar medal. The family name was Munday but Fitzroy, Fred's middle name became his professional name.  His sister used the name Miss Adeline Patty. Her family name was Adeline Martha Munday. \n\nThe V&A was given a small collection of medals awarded to Fred Fitzroy and a photograph of him aged about 12 is in the Theatre Museum. The medal itself was probably mass produced by a manufacturer in Birmingham.",
