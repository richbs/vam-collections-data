Her  work is visually intriguing with meanings hinted at obliquely. Her style is distinctive  and inventively eclectic, drawing on an extensive array of materials and themes. Her work often combines poetry and collage to create striking, sculptural objects. \n\nThis ring is set with two gold flies flanking a rectangle of bright green garnet  crystals. It relates to her poems \u2018The Destiny of Flies\u2019 and \u2018Hope\u2019 \u2013 which present a  rather dark view of humanity\u2019s yearnings and searching. In 'The Destiny of Flies', she describes :\n\n\"A vast array of silent dancing soldiers,\nHow they turn and waltz their last upended hours,\nWhile others pass,\nUnhindered, into the day.\"\n\nThe green field above which the flies hover is made of uvarovite garnet. The pattern on the flies' wings was made by pressing leaves into the gold.",
