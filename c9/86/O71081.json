The bearded Judas stands next to him and embraces him, with his left hand holding Christ's shoulder. A soldier wearing armour, grasps Christ's cloak with his left hand and with his right holds the handle of his sword, which rests in the scabbard. Three other soldiers, two holding spears and one a battle-axe, and a civilian wearing a rolled-brim hat and holding a lantern, surround them. St. Peter, tonsured and bearded and wearing gown and cloak, stands on Christ's right, looking up at him, holding his sword which rests in his scabbard. With his right hand, Christ bestows his healing on Malchus, who looks upwards. Malchus is shown on his hands and knees with his head twisted round in a most unnatural, if not impossible, position. He wears a low-belted doublet and a rolled-brim hat, and holds a staff in his left hand. On the right of the panel is a similar figure, kneeling and looking up, his right hand raised.\n\nThe bottom right corner of the panel is missing. The surface of the panel is white and smooth and appears to have been cleaned. Only traces of paint remain, including some dark colouring on the faces of the high priest's men. Green paint and the usual daisy pattern remain on the ground at the bottom of the panel. There are traces of red and gilding on the robes of the figures. There are five holes drilled in the back of the panel. The bottom has been cut away.",

Judas stands next to him and embraces him, with his left holding Christ's shoulder. A soldier grasps Christ's cloak and holds the handle of his sword, which rests in the scabbard. Three other soldiers and a civilian surround them. St. Peter stands on Christ's right, looking up at him, holding his sword which rests in his scabbard. With his right hand, Christ bestows his healing on Malchus. Malchus is shown on his hands and knees with his head twisted round in a most unnatural, if not impossible, position. \nThe gesture of Christ's hand towards the twisted figure of Malchus is common in English medieval alabasters. It no doubt refers to Christ's healing of Malchus's ear, although in the Gospel he is described touching it.",
