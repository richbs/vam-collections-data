On the reverse is an image, turned left through ninety degrees, of a large, green mask (on the wearer's shoulders) and two figures. The larger figure, nearest the top, has its arms stretched toward the mask, while the other is squatting holding its head in its hands. This image is also found on the sleeves but appears abstracted as it is not completely visible. The wide, upturned cuffs are printed with the same pattern as the front of the jacket. It is unlined.",
