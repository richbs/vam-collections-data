The garment is of the usual kimono construction but without the addition of extra material at each side of the front opening. The straight neckband extends to the hem and there is a double-layered overcollar, the bottom layer of dark blue ribbed silk, the top layer of black ribbed silk. The sleeves are open all the way up at the wrist side and closed at the body side. There is a natural-coloured silk lining which stops short of the hem and does not line the sleeves.\nThe design is mostly confined to the waist area (back and front) and consists of resist-dyed patterns. There are horizontal zig-zag bands with small circular motifs between, and larger circles above and below the bands. The patterns extend onto the sleeves and there are also widely-spaced circles across the hem. The motifs were achieved by various combinations of stitching and binding before dyeing the silk a rich brown colour.",
