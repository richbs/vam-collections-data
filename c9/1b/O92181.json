The position of the hands holding the shield is awkward and the presence of gilding, heavily worn on the sides of the shield which would be protected somewhat in its present position points to this being from an earlier piece.  This is borne out by the style of the shield, the outline being closest to 13th century examples such as the tiles in the Chapter House at Westminster Abbey and the drawing of the castle is also consistent with this.\nThe arms are those of Castille and must date from the 13th century, probably an illusion to the marriage of Louis VIII to Blanche of Castille.",
