It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years. Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn\u2019t needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nActor and director Sir John Gielgud made his London debut in 1921 at the Old Vic Theatre as the Herald in Henry V and went on to become one of Britain's greatest actors.  He directed He Was Born Gay with Emlyn Williams and it was first produced at the Queen's Theatre in May 1937 before going on tour. Gielgud directed and acted in many productions in London and at the Stratford Memorial Theatre, including The Cherry Orchard (1954) and The Chalk Garden (1956), and appeared in many films. His autobiography Early Stages was published in 1939 and he was knighted in 1953.",
