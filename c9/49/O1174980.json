Made of nylon, it wasn't made to be worn, but rather to be held up outstretched in the audience so that the band could see your adoration. This fashion came from the British phenomenon of having a scarf in your supported team's colours, and holding it up on the football terraces.\n\nDavid Cassidy was a child actor whose success came from the American TV series The Partridge Family in the early 1970s. The characters from the show released several albums of pop songs, which included solo outings from Cassidy. His stature grew and he became a teen idol, selling out stadium concerts in the UK, Australia and America. He continued to record up until the mid 1980s and still performs concerts today, as well as taking occasional acting roles.",
