He wrote: '\u2026the turnings and windings of the valley, desolate though it was, overlooked by noble mountains wearing their snowy caps, were not wanting in that sterner beauty which is associated with grandeur; and some of my best pictures were obtained in following the course of the river to the glacier at the head of the valley \u2013 a distance of about 50 miles.\u2019",
