            "public_access_description": "Oscar Lewenstein (1917-1997) was one of the most significant producers of the post-war years. He began his theatrical career with the Glasgow Unity Theatre, serving as the theatre's General Manager from 1947-1949, and then in 1952 began his long association with the Royal Court Theatre when he was hired as General Manager. The Court was then known principally for its historical connections with the Harley Granville Barker - John Eugene Vedrenne management in the 1900s,  but Lewenstein believed that its future lay with new writing and suggested the appointment of George Devine as Artistic Director. With the playwright, Ronald Duncan, they founded the English Stage Company, and it was the success of their third production, Look Back in Anger, that established the reputation both of the playwright, John Osborne, and of the Royal Court, and turned the production's opening date, 8 May 1956, into a major land-mark in the development of British theatre. \n\nThis collage is made of leaflets which advertise plays produced by Oscar Lewenstein at the Royal Court Theatre, 1972-1975. The plays are: The Merry-Go-Round by D.H. Lawrence (1973), The City by Yutaka Higashi (1974), Don's Party by David Williamson (1975), The Great Caper by Ken Campbell (1974), The Sea by Edward Bond (1973), Runaway by Peter Ransley (1974), Play Mas by Mustapha Matura (1974), A South African Season (The Island by Athol Fugard, John Kani and Winston Ntshona, Sizwe Banzi is Dead by Athol Fugard, John Kani and Winston Ntshona, and Statements After an Arrest Under the Immorality Act by Athol Fugard (1974)), Entertaining Mr Sloane by Joe Orton (1975), Life Class by David Storey (1974), The Farm by David Storey (1973), A Sense of Detachment by John Osborne (1972), Loot by Joe Orton (1975), Magnificence by Howard Brenton (1973), The Freedom of the City by Brian Friel (1973), Krapp's Last Tape and Not I by Samuel Beckett (1973), What the Butler Saw by Joe Orton (1975), Tooth of Crime by Sam Shepard (1974), Cromwell by David Storey (1973), Savages by Christopher Hampton (1973), Objections to Sex and Violence by Caryl Churchill (1975), Bingo by Edward Bond (1974), The Removalists by David Williamson (1973), and A Pagan Place by Edna O'Brien (1972).",
