            "physical_description": "Board game, with folding game board, plastic pieces, 'chance' cards, wooden dice, plastic dice shaker and order form for limited edition print, in a printed cardboard box with inserts.\n[box base and insert] Cardboard, printed blue on one side, folded and glued to form a box base. With an untreated cardboard insert extending most of the way across the base.\n[box lid] Cardboard, printed and folded. Originally glued, it is now held in place by clear tape, which has dried and is peeling. On the front is a painting of Sir Francis Chichester's yacht, the Gypsy Moth IV, in heavy seas rounding Cape Horn in the distance, a colour photograph of Sir Francis, underneath which is his signature, in the top left corner, the text 'The Sir Francis Chichester Game. Salute to a Great Sailor!' across the top and further text across the bottom and down the right hand side. The title is repeated in black and red text on each of the four sides, along with a silhouette, in red, of the Gypsy Moth IV. On the inside of the lid a short summary of Chichester's circumnavigation is printed in black ink, as well as the rules of the game.\n[order form] A sheet of cream-coloured paper, printed in black text on one side, to be used as an order form for a print of the painting on the lid of the box. A crease runs diagonally left from the top edge to mid-way along the left side.\n[box with game pieces] White and blue cardboard box, with two see-through cellophane windows in the lid, waves, seagulls and clouds depicted in white lines and the text 'Sir Francis Chichester Game' also written in white. Inside are two further blue cardboard inserts. One holds six small plastic yachts, with white hulls and different coloured sails (white, green, yellow, red and light and dark blue), which are slotted into holes in the base of the insert, which has details in white to suggest bow waves coming from each yacht. The other holds; a mottled grey/pink plastic dice shaker; two wooden dice, one red, one blue, both with embossed gold spots; four packs of game cards (consisting of: 10 'foul weather' cards in purple; 10 'fair weather' cards in yellow; 39 'Sydney to Plymouth' cards in blue; 40 'Plymouth to Sydney' in pink), printed in black with the image of a yacht and title on one side and instructions on the other, each pack held together by an elastic band.\n[game board] Printed paper with plastic coating mounted onto three pieces of board covered with blue plastic attached and hinged together using light blue cloth. The playing surface shows a map of the world, with land masses in green and oceans in various blue-greens. Sir Francis Chichester's route from Plymouth to Sydney and back is marked in red, along with arrows denoting wind direction, a compass in the bottom left and right-hand corners, the limit of sea ice, pictures of whales and other sea creatures and icebergs. Also on the map are four rectangles, in pink, yellow, purple and blue, on which the 'chance' cards are placed. The whole is covered by a grid of longitude and latitude, which is marked around the perimeter of the playing surface. Across  the top of the board are images of Chichester's yacht Gypsy Moth IV - from left to right: diagrams and technical specifications; a colour photograph of her on trial in the Solent, and a black and white photograph of her rounding Cape Horn.",

It is a game for 2 to 6 players, and involves moving yachts around the board following Sir Francis' original route from Portsmouth to Sydney and back again, according to the throw of the dice and instructions on 'chance' cards. It was one of several games and toys produced around this time under the Tri-ang trademark which had a sailing theme.",
