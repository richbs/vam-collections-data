The set, which included chairs, couches and a throne, was made by the firm of Jacob-Desmalter, who were to become large-scale suppliers to the new imperial court. They stamped their mark on the underside of the stools. \n\nThe crossed sword motif was particularly appropriate for the new power, which had been founded on military success. The bills for the stools list them as \u2018\u00e0 sabres antiques\u2019. Mameluke sabres of this type were very fashionable in the Empire period. The stools are also marked underneath with inventory marks for the royal Ch\u00e2teau de Saint Cloud, just outside Paris, where they were presumably moved during the 19th century. The elegant silk upholstery was at one time thought to be original but is now believed to have been added during the reign of Napoleon III (1852\u20131871).",
