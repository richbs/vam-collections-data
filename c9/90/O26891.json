Also subject variations occur and some are educational, for example The Counties of England.\n\nThe object of the game is for each player to collect as many complete `families' as possible.  \nOne of the players deals out all the cards.  If more than one round is played, the players take it in turn to deal.  It does not matter if some players have one card more than others.\nEach player looks at his cards and sorts them into families.\nIt is important that players keep their cards hidden from each other.  With young children it is a good idea if they can lay their cards out of view of the other players.\nWhen all the players are ready, the person to the dealer's left asks any player, by name, for a particular card (eg Master Baker).  He must already possess at least one of member of the same family, ie Mrs. Baker.  If the person asked has the card, he must give it to the first player, who may again ask anybody for a card of any family as long as he already has one card belonging to that family.  \nHe continues to do this until he fails to obtain a card.  If the person asked does not have the card requested, it is his turn to ask for cards.\nWhen a player collects all the cards of the same family, he puts them into a pile face down in front of him.\nPlay continues until all the families have been completed\nThe winner is the person who collects the most families.",
