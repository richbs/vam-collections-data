The card is mitred at the top to make a porch roof shape, and the front shows an anthropomorphic cat in a blue dress and mob cap, carrying a yellow umbrella and a large envelope, presumably a card for the kitten inside (partly visible through a cut-out door); the wording reads:\n2   HAPPY BIRTHDAY Dear !\nwith the figure two in gold foil embossed with animals.  Inside is an illustration of a kitten wearing a mob cap, sitting on a doorstep in front of a birthday cake, with another kitten wearing  pink dungarees and a check shirt, and carrying a different umbrella in the rain; the verse reads:\nYou're all of TWO Years Old today,  \nHow very big you are,\nAnd all your little playmates\nBring wishes from near and far !",
