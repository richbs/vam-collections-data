Designs are usually produced singly and it can be hard to visualise how they will appear on a stage crowded with other costumes.  Stone's designs for this production were mostly drawn in pen and ink so this drawing shows the colours and gives an idea of how they should be graded.  The basic outlines and character identifications are reproduced mechanically and the colour then filled in by the designer and probably distributed to the various costume makers.  \nAlthough theatre designs are often considered works of art and are sought after by museums and private collectors, their artistic worth or decorative qualities are secondary to whether they 'work' on stage.  The success of a costume design cannot be judged until it is translated into fabric, texture and decoration by the costume makers and seen as part of the whole stage picture.  Some designers are very knowledgeable about costume making and produce very detailed designs, with notes on fabrics and making techniques, others create an 'atmospheric' drawing, which gives the feeling of the costume, and they then either work closely with the costume maker to realise their concept or have trusted makers who know their work and can create the effects they have in mind.",
