They were brought together by the school's Headteacher, Adrian Percy Bishop. \nCovering the years 1918 to 1924, the exercise books record in detail the daily life of village children, and how they gained knowledge of the wider world through education and activities. They offer a valuable resource for understanding children's experience immediately after the First World War, and how they were trained to think and write about themselves and others.",
