ISBN 1851773088.\nThe Frankfurt Cabinet is a modern example in the long tradition of furniture intended as display object, made of exotic materials and concealing its function beneath its decoration. Its design contrasts with the prevailing functionalism of much twentieth-century furniture collected by the Museum and demonstrates the eclectic use of historical sources typical of postmodernism, the most fashionable design style of the 1980s. The light wood and flat veneered surfaces recall central European Biedermeier furniture of the early nineteenth century, the checkerboard device and simplified geometry echo early-twentieth-century Viennese patterning, and the asymmetrical design and combination of rich materials are reminiscent of\nArt Deco.\n\nLit.
