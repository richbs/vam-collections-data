This diminutive medal holds in its small boudaries a miniaturised world: on the obverse, a jungle of roots falls from a cloud, while on the reverse a mountain stems from these roots. The two-sidedness of the medal is used to play with contrasts, as Cloud Roots reflects on the unlikely union of the incredibly light (the cloud) with the incredibly heavy (the mountain). The theme of nature and the motif of the mountain recur in Ratcliffe's work, reflecting environmental concerns which are often found at the heart of her medal-making.",

            "history_note": "This medal was bought from the artist in 2012, when it was shown at the V&A as part of \"The New Medallists\", a display celebrating the first six years of the New Medallist scheme, an initiative run by the British Art Medal Society. By nurturing a new generation of medallists, the scheme is designed to breathe new life into the tradition of the art medal. The 2005/6 recipient of the New Medallist scheme, Natasha Ratcliffe has since exhibited nationally and internationally and received commissions, notably from the Royal Mint, the Biochemical Society and the Art Fund.\n\nRatcliffe creates medals that are often inspired by nature: moutains (first appearing in her  early medal Les Gardiens de Nuit, 2002, at the British Museum), trees, skys recur in her work.  Cloud Roots \"reflects on the unlikely union of the incredibly heavy with the incredibly light: two-sided, the medal lends itself to carrying two worlds radically opposed to one another. Borne on roots, an enchanted mountain is suspended in thin air while these same roots sprout from a levitating cloud.\" (Vandenbrouck-Przybylski and Leavitt Bourne, 2012, p. 18).  The substancial role granted to lettering and the skillful rendering of a miniaturised world in the confined boundaries of the medal, are evocative of the work of Pisanello, the Italian Renaissance father of medallic art.",
