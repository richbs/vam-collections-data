Colours: white ground, motifs primarily in bright blue and a faded light red. Inscriptions in white on a black ground.\n\nThe canopy is made up of several widths of mill-made cotton fabric. The design is centred on a large floral medallion, surrounded by a fish motif. Quarter-medallions are repeated in each corner. There are several rosette borders, broad and narrow, and the field is covered with an all-over pattern of flowering branches. At regular intervals figures of lions or tigers are superimposed on this background, incorporating bands of Persian script. Many other areas of the cloth also contain bands of the script. Inscriptions include the following: some couplets of indifferent verse, a reference of Jonah and the whole, and the statement that the cloth is a <i>shamiana</i>, made at Jafarganj (near Fatehpur, Uttar Pradesh, between Lucknow and Allahabad) in 1302 A.H. (1884 A.D.) The name of the workshop is given, and there is a reference to Shaikh Amdad Ali, who may have composed the verses or been the patron who commissioned the cloth. (These large canopies were made at Jafarganj to special orders, not carried as stock). Most of the inscriptions are repeated several times, e.g., on all four sides of the cloth. It was probably ordered as a canopy for the tombs of a particular Muslim saint to be used at certain festivals, hence the popular name \"feast cloth\".",
