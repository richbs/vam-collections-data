He also wears a mask with a large nose and appears to be using a noise maker. These latter features would indicate that he may be a performer from a Commedia dell'Arte troupe. The Commedia dell'Arte has a long history, much of which was unrecorded. We know that in the Middle Ages, bands of performers travelled around Europe performing comic and ribald productions at fairs and festivals. Eventually, from these early productions emerged a group of stock characters that we know as 'Commedia dell'Arte figures'. Some of the more well known characters include Harlequin and Scaramouche. Their productions were largely unscripted and were simply farcical sketches with lots of play-violence and jokes about bodily functions.\n\nMany engravings of Commedia performers survive from the 17th century and were used by glass painters and artists in other media as imagery sources. In the 18th century Commedia figures were made by all the newly emergent porcelain factories in Europe. \n\nIn the middle of the sixteenth century, new techniques for producing decorated glass were introduced. Glass paints known as 'enamels' were used to paint directly onto the glass; similar to painting onto a canvas. The colours were produced by adding metallic oxides to a glass frit mixture and the resulting colour range included delicate blues, yellows and reds as you see here.",
