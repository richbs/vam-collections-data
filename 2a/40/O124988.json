Served in the army, retired because of ill-health, and entered RA Schools 1818. Exhibited 171 landscapes at the RA between 1824 and 1870,131 at the BI 1822-55, and 24 at the SBA 1825-37. Subjects mainly views in Devon, but also elsewhere in England, Wales and Scotland; visited, in his yacht, France, Spain and Italy. From 1847 he collaborated regularly with the animal painter T S Cooper and sometimes with Sir Edwin Landseer. Elected ARA 1834, RA 1838. According to Cooper, he saw painting 'more of a pastime than as a business, and he always gave me the impression that he considered the profession beneath him'. Retired from the RA 1871, and died at Vleeson Bank, South Africa, 5 June 1879. \nLIT: \tAthenaeum 12 July 1879, p58 (obit); Art Journal 1879, p184 (obit); T S Cooper My Life 1890, I, pp325-30 \nA Distant View of Windsor from St George's Hill \nFA 108 Neg GA1193 \nMillboard, 25 X 35.2 cm (9 ?

Lee was elected RA in 1838, and submitted paintings from that address between 1824 and 1841. Lee exhibited a large (53 by 77 inches, including frame) painting of the same subject at the BI in 1840 (149). \n\nWooded Glen 1827-1888 Neg 34013 \nCanvas, 74.8 X 105.3 cm (29 \u00bd X 41\u00bd ins) \nSigned and dated 'F R Lee RA/T S Cooper ARA 1860' bl Given by Mrs Charles Rivas 1888 \nThe cattle, and presumably the sheep, were painted by Cooper. The two artists regularly collaborated from 1847; according to Cooper, 'We settled that he should paint the landscape part first, and send the picture up to me in an advanced state, the part where I was to introduce the cattle being only just coloured over (p329)'. The painting does not seem to have been exhibited. \n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
