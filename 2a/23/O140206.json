            "public_access_description": "The 1851 Great Exhibition inspired a series of \u2018London International Exhibitions\u2019 which took place in South Kensington in 1871, 1872, 1873 and 1874. Fine arts and scientific inventions and discoveries remained central display themes but each exhibition presented different aspects of manufacture. In 1872 one emphasis was on jewellery, including \u2018peasant jewellery\u2019. The Exhibition Commissioners arranged with the South Kensington Museum (later V&A) to make a collection of peasant jewellery from \u2018all parts of the world, which should become public property, for exhibition in the Museum after the close of the Exhibition\u2019. A letter was sent by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to British representatives overseas asking for their help in securing pieces of jewellery, particularly examples with \u2018a direct connection with the native instinctive art, which has been handed down by a long tradition\u2019. The outcome was considered to be \u2018most satisfactory \u2026 a collection of characteristic ornaments never before equalled was obtained\u2019. \n\nThis ornament is part of this collection. It is described in the Museum\u2019s accessions register as an \u2018ornament for the top of a fez or tarboosh\u2019 (a round brimless red felt hat) from Egypt. It is formed of a silver disc from which hang seventeen chains and pendants. The pendants appear to represent common domestic objects including a hammer, an axe, a sword, a coffee pot and a frying pan.
