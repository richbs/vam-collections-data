Best known for his designs for posters promoting the London Underground and Shell Petrol, he used strong colours and minimal text to create memorable eye-catching images that turned the poster from an advertising tool into an art form. \n\nIt was not surprising that theatre managements should see the potential in McKnight Kauffer's striking designs. From the 1920s until his death in 1954 he created scenery and costumes for plays, ballets and operas on the London stage. His set designs for Ernest Milton's production of  Othello (St James's Theatre,1932) used the bold blocks of colour of the poster designer. They were realised in three-dimensions with flat cut-out pieces of scenery representing the buildings and arcades of Venice and Cyprus. These enabled the scene changes to be swift whilst creating a setting that did not overwhelm the action.",
