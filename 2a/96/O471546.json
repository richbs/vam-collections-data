The whole surface is painted with a design of ferocious demonic tusked masks set within scrolls in black and red, with lighter borders (possibly the natural wood). The face is reinforced at intervals with horizontal rows of cane and rattan strips and adorned with ten rows of long dark hair tufts forced into narrow slits set in rows in the soft wooden board. Tufts also adorn the top and bottom points of the shield. Traditionally these would have been human hair taken from the heads of slain enemies and highly prized by the Kenyahs.\nThe inside of the shield is furnished with a carved wooden hand grip made from a single wooden timber set inside the concave side of the V. The inside of the shield is also painted with a similar motif of ferocious tusked masks and scrolls.",
