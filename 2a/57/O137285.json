Although Turnbull and Asser offer a full range of menswear products in a huge array of colours, they are best known for their bespoke shirts and ties. These are made in their own factories in England using one of hundreds of different fabrics which have been designed just for Turnbull & Asser. \n\nThis garment was given to the museum by Sir Roy Strong. An author, broadcaster, former Director of the National Portrait Gallery and from 1974-1987, Director and Secretary of the Victoria & Albert Museum; Sir Roy was a high-profile figure renowned for his sartorial flair. This shirt was originally worn under a two-piece lightweight brown wool suit with a fine white woven fleck, designed by John Michael. It was donated as an ensemble, along with a pair of brown leather Moreschi shoes and a brown and cream silk bow tie.",
