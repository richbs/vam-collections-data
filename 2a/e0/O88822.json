It was written in 1848 and first published in 1850 in the Pre-Raphaelite magazine The Germ, although frequently revised thereafter. In 1871 Rossetti was commissioned to create a visual version of the poem. This is the second of two sketches for the painting, which is in a private collection. The model was Alexa Wilding. She is clad like an angel in white but her appearance is nonetheless corporeal and sensuous. It is an excellent example of Rossetti's skill in handling chalks.",
