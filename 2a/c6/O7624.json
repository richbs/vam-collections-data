These are known as \u2018tracery lights\u2019. \n\nThe angel in this panel has a set of four wings instead of two. This identifies him as a cherub. Angels, celestial creatures, figure prominently in many of the world\u2019s religions. Christianity inherited its devotion to angels from the Jewish faith from which it emerged. \n\nFrom early on, the great theologians of the Christian church devoted much effort to identifying and understanding the role of angels in God\u2019s creation. About the year 500, one scholar wrote a treatise called \u2018The Celestial Hierarchy\u2019. He scoured the Old and New Testaments for information relating to angels. From this he compiled a list of different types of angels according to their functions. He claimed that there were nine orders of angels, divided into three hierarchies. Each order had a specific function, such as the Order of the Archangels, who act as messengers between God and mankind. The author of this treatise is known as the \u2018Pseudo-St Denis\u2019 or \u2018Pseudo-Aeropagite\u2019, because he was once thought to be the St Denis (or Dionysus) the Aeropagite who is mentioned in the New Testament Book of Acts. \n\nThe first hierarchy of angels consists of Seraphim, Cherubim and Thrones. They encircle the throne of the Godhead and protect the Ark of the Covenant. According to the Book of Genesis, God sent the Cherubim to drive out Adam and Eve from Paradise, after they had eaten the forbidden fruit. The Cherubim also guard the Tree of Life.\n\nIn medieval art the Cherubim acquired four wings, probably in reference to the vision of the Prophet Ezekiel.",

These are known as 'tracery lights'. \n\nThe angel in this panel has a set of four wings instead of two. This would identify him as a cherub.\n\nAngels, divine creatures, figure prominently in many of the world's religions. The Christian religion inherited its devotion to angels from the Jewish faith, out of which it emerged. \n\nFrom early on in the Christian church its great theologians devoted much effort to identifying and understanding the role of angels in God's creation. Around the year 500, a church scholar wrote a treatise called 'The Celestial Hierarchy'. \n\nThe author of this treatise, known as 'Pseudo-St Denis' because formerly he was thought to be St Denis the Aeropagite who is mentioned in the New Testament Book of Acts, scoured the Old and New Testaments for information relating to angels. From this he compiled a list of different types of angels according to their functions. He claimed that there were nine Orders of angels divided into three hierarchies. Each Order had a specific function such as the Order of the Archangels who act as messengers between God and mankind. \n\nThe first hierarchy of angels consists of Seraphim, Cherubim and Thrones. The Cherubim encircle the throne of the Godhead and protect the Ark of the Covenant. According to the Book of Genesis God sent the Cherubim to drive Adam and Eve out of Paradise after they had eaten the forbidden fruit. The Cherubim are also guarding the Tree of Life.\n\nIn medieval art the Cherubim acquired four wings probably in reference to the vision of the Prophet Ezekiel.",
