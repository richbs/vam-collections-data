This statuette is a reduced copy of the much venerated statue of the Virgin and Child in the church of the Annunziata at Trapani, which seems to derive from a lost prototype by Nino Pisano. The base of this statuette can hardly have been carved before the seventeenth century, and since the material and surface decoration of the figure and the base are uniform, the whole work is likely to be of later date than the 16th century. The stemma, which shows five flowers surmounted by a saw or sickle, is perhaps a debased variant of the arms of Trapani.",
