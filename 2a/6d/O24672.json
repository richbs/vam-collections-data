There is additional inlay of crushed eggshell and mother-of-pearl.\nThe design, in a loosely 'Tang revival' style is of a  central rounded containing a duck with foliage in its mouth, surrounded by stylized petals. The rim is decorated with a simple line of peal dots. \nSEAL: in red on base, 'Shen Fuwen yin'\nDISCUSSION: The inspiration for the design is in the decoration of the Dunhuang caves, an abiding source of artistic models since the 1940s, and the principal alternative source of design ideas to the continuations of 18th century court style dominating many areas e.g. lacquer carving. A note on the RPs in the maker's hand confirms his execution of the piece, despite his age. \nCOMPARE: Other works by Shen Fuwen in the collection are: FE.82-1977(Vase, c. 1945). FE.17-1987(Vase, c.1947). FE.149-1988(Vase, 1955). See these entries for additional information on the artist. (cc 26/09/89)",
