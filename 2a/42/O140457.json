On this chalice, the Latin inscription around the bowl emphasizes this function.  This silver chalice was made in the early 13th century, a time when Iceland had cultural, trade and diplomatic links with northern Europe, especially with Norway and England. In this period Icelandic culture flourished, notably through the work of writers like Snorri Sturluson (1178-1241), the great scholar, poet and historian. The decoration and style of this chalice, particularly the foliate decoration of the knop, reflects a knowledge of Romanesque sculptural forms.",

Paul remarks, 'Is not the cup of thanksgiving for which we give thanks a participation in the blood of Christ?' (1 Corinthians 10:16). This concept is illlustrated textually on this chalice, which is inscribed in Latin: 'From hence is drunk the pure flow of the Divine Blook'. From an early period chalices were made of precious metals, representing the precious nature of the Eucharist, or Communion, that part of a Christian service in which Christians believe that they partake of Christ's sacrifice by means of consecrated bread and wine. This one was probably a chalice used by biships and priests in the Mass. It came from Grund in northern Iceland, and may have belonged to cathedral in nearby Holar. It was probably brought there from England.'\nCampbell, Marian, 'The medieval chalices of Iceland and Norway', in Lilja Arnadottir and Ketil Kiran ed., <u> Church and art: the medieval church in Norway and Iceland </u>, Reykjavik 1997, pp. 102-4, pl. 1",

On the Chalice stand, SUMMITVR HINC NVNDA DIVINI SANGVINIS VNDA\"\n\nBritish Library Sacred Exhibition RF.2006/484\n[Chalice] Historical significance: Although the origins of this chalice are not certain, it seems likely that it was made in Iceland. A similar chalice from Svalbard, also in Northern Iceland, can be found in the National Museum in Copenhagen.\n\nScandinavian silversmiths were noted for their metalworking skills from the earliest times. This chalice belongs to the finest period of Icelandic culture, the age of Snorri Sturluson (1178-1241), the great scholar, poet and historian. During this period Icelanders were in frequent touch with the rest of Europe, especially Scandinavia and England. This piece shows their knowledge of romanesque forms and decoration- seen particularly in the foliate design of the knop.\n\nIceland converted to Christianity during the 11th and 12th centuries, considerably later than the rest of Europe. However, production of ecclesiastical goldsmiths work soon flourished.\n\nThe custom of communicating in two kinds (receiving both bread and wine) was followed in the Roman Catholic Church until around the 13th century when the wine was gradually withdrawn from the laity and received by the priest alone.",
