American patchwork designs showing large central stars have been given various names in the past and, as well as 'Rising Star', 'Star of Bethlehem' and 'Lone Star', these have also been known as 'Blazing Star' and, more regionally, 'Lone Star of Texas'. Although complete, this bed cover does not have an outer border. On other examples this usually takes the form of squares or stripes of plain or patterned fabrics. \n\nDespite their association with America, large star designs are not exclusive to that country as British examples have been traced back as far as the late eighteenth century.",

            "historical_context_note": "The quilt relies on the choice of small patterned printed cottons for the boldness and clarity of its design. Stripes, dots and variations of other simple repeating designs are used. The only floral design in the quilt, a flamboyant navy blue and white 'art nouveau' design, is also the easiest to date and suggests that the quilt was made at the end of the nineteenth century.\n\nAmerican patchwork designs showing large central stars have been given various names in the past and, as well as 'Rising Star', 'Star of Bethlehem' and 'Lone Star', these have also been known as 'Blazing Star' and, more regionally, 'Lone Star of Texas'. Although complete, this bed cover does not have an outer border. On other examples this usually takes the form of squares or stripes of plain or patterned fabrics. Despite their association with America, large star designs are not exclusive to that country as British examples have been traced back as far as the late eighteenth century.",
