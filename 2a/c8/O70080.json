            "public_access_description": "The techniques used in carving in wood and stone were fundamentally the same. First the sculptor carved the rough shape of the piece, a process known as \u2018blocking out\u2019. Then, he would work the surface with knives or chisels and abrasives. The figure was generally held horizontally at a workbench and attached to cylindrical shafts, so the sculptor could turn the piece as he carved. Small-scale pieces were generally carved at a workbench. \n\nThe downward glance of the Infant St John the Baptist implies that this piece was originally intended to be placed above the viewer. The twisting pose and tenderness of expression suggest it is the work of the Granada sculptor Jos\u00e9 Risue\u00f1o. In Spain the surface decoration was further specialised. The work was divided between craftsmen who executed flesh tones, gilding or drapery. This often gave the sculpture an extraordinarily lifelike appearance.",
