The modelling of the flowers and leaves is achieved with loose hatched lines in deeper tones of paint. A red poppy with leaves and a bud dominates the left hand side of the lower  portion of the painting.  On the right  is a yellow tulip shown above a pink water-lily-like flower and bud surrounded by a bunch of leaves of differing shapes and sizes.  Some of these leaves and the edge of the poppy study have been cut off by the applied strips of dark grey paper which form an inner border with black outlines. These are laid on the plain ivory-coloured main border which has strips of pale buff-coloured paper stuck along its margins with two black lines ruled along its inner edges.  The right hand side shows signs of damage where a former paper gutter has probably been removed when the present textile strip was added as a gutter for the present binding of the album.",

It contains 62 leaves on which are Mughal miniature paintings, drawing and flower studies on both sides. The binding is covered with an Indian brocade silk that may have been cut from lengths brought home by the 2nd Lord Clive, who served as Governor of Madras, 1799 to 1803.  The album was sold from Powis Castle at Sotheby's sale, 16 to 18 January 1956, lot 332A.",
