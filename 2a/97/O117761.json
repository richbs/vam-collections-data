(NB: vertical lines of 13.5 cm.) max. of apparently asymmetrical knotting, open to the left, to accommodate extra warp threads across the lower borders.)   75 knots per sq. inch (1276 per sq.dm.)\n\nSIDE FINISH: both sides incomplete with one cord in place and returned wefts.\n\nEND FINISH: lower: incomplete; 1 cm. of plain weave with white cotton weft after one line of plain soumak in dark pink over 3 threads and back under 2.  Evidence of 3 cms. twisted warp loop fringe, some now knotted in pairs.  Upper: incomplete; 0.5 cms. max of plain weave with white cotton weft.\n\nDESIGN: field: cream ground including spandrels; diagonal lattice formed by dark blue stylised leaves outlined in light red and forming a cross at each inter-section.  The lattice frames 9-1/2 bands of four or five floral sprigs with predominantly red flowerheads.  The four-sided angular niche and its lattice contains, on dark blue, an orange vertical bar, hooked towards both ends.  The spandrels each have two lattice frames, side by side, with small floral sprigs below and within.  To either side of the head of the niche are lines in dark brown that could be the date in Arabic numerals.\n\nMAIN BORDER: red ground with large angular elaborate S shapes in most of the colours; each has a cross bar and triangles at the branched terminals.\n\nInner and outer border and the border outlining the niche have dark green (sometimes dark blue) ground with five-petalled flowers and between them narrow, single-angles mostly in green or white.\n\nInnermost border: a reciprocal diamond-headed design in blue and light red.\n\nGuard stripes are small diagonal blocks of cream and black.",
