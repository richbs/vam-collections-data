The relief is inscribed on the back with the name MARY VO(Y)CE and the dates of her birth, 24th August 1651 and her death 31st August 1729. She was undoubtedly related in some way to Gamaliel Voyce who appears in another medallion (A.18-1936), and given their respective dates she could have been his mother.\nIt is made by David Le Marchand in ca. 1712 in Britain. David Le Marchand (1674-1726) was famed for his ivory carvings, particularly his portraits. He was a native of Dieppe, France, and came from a Huguenot, or Protestant, family. With the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, and the consequent persecution of non-Catholics, he had to flee France. He was next recorded in Edinburgh in 1696, where he is documented as receiving official permission to open a shop and take on apprentices. He was in London by 1700, when he started to achieve a reputation for his portraits. Despite his wide circle of important patrons and his evident success, Le Marchand apparently died in poverty, though the exact reasons for this are unknown. He is recognised as the most distinguished ivory carver to have worked in England in the early 18th century, a period when the art enjoyed a popularity unknown since the Middle Ages.",
