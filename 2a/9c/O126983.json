Over 400,000 copies sold to the German public, demonstrating a national thirst for propagandistic images of the F\u00fchrer.\n\nHitler wie ihn keiner Kennt was part of a series designed to show Hitler\u2019s approachable, charismatic edge. As well as being printed as part of Hoffmann\u2019s photographic compilations, photographs were also reproduced in pocket books, on cigarette cards, picture postcards and in the press, reaching a yet wider public. This image of Hitler with his dog, promoting the countryside and dog lover at rest, was reproduced with the startling caption (paraphrased) \u2018When evil people wanted to hurt him [Hitler] inside, at his most vulnerable, they poisoned his favourite dog. This is how evil fights against a good man\u2019.",
