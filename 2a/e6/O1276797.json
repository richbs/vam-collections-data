Alongside his practice as an artist, he is known as an influential writer and teacher, working as Professor in Experimental Photography, University of Kassel, Germany from 1971 until 2009.  Since first exhibiting in the 1960s, he has consistently explored the photogram's numerous technical, conceptual and visual possibilities, resulting in works that range from the figurative to the abstract.    \n\nThis portfolio of fifteen gelatin silver print reproductions of photograms, made by Neus\u00fcss between 1960 and 1970, also includes a self-portrait which documents the photogram technique and two details from an original photogram with photogchemical oxidations.",
