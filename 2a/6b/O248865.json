This was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1840, and is now in the Royal Collection at Windsor Castle. A slightly later replica, of higher quality, was acquired by Sir Robert Peel from Chantrey's studio in 1844, and is now in the National Portrait Gallery. Cheverton\u2019s work was evidently esteemed within the highest levels of society. In 1845, this ivory bust was shown at the Royal Society, at a soir\u00e9e hosted by the President, the Marquis of Northampton, and attended by Prince Albert. \nBenjamin Cheverton (1796-1876) was the son of a farmer and a small landowner. During the 1820s he perfected a machine capable of producing reduced miniature versions, usually in ivory, of full-size sculptures. This had been invented by his mentor, John Isaac Hawkins, and was similar to machines devised by the engineer and inventor James Watt (1736-1819). Cheverton\u2019s machine was up and running by early 1828. He first showed products at exhibitions, and issued items which might have popular appeal, such as busts of Shakespeare or Milton. Later he took commission from owners of busts or other sculptures who desired small copies. His ivories were produced to a high standard, and he maintained that the machine itself was capable of making objects of such quality.",
