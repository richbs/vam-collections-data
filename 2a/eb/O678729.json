Catalogue of the exhibition held at the Victoria and Albert Museum, June-September 1970.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n'[...](a) <b>Pencil sketch for the illustration 'Fagin in the Condemned Cell' to </b><b><i>Oliver Twist</i></b>\nSigned in ink <i>GE Cruikshank </i>and inscribed <i>Fagin in the condemned cell</i>\n5x6<sub>7/8</sub>\n9995.K\n\nCruikshank identified himself to a remarkable degree with the image of Fagin in the condemned cell. His earliest account of the inspiration of this plate was given to Horace Mayhew. One morning after the artist had begun to despair of creating a graphic equivalent of Dickens's gripping 'out and outer', Cruikshank said he sat up in bed with his hand covering his chin, his fingertips between his lips, his whole attitude expressive of disappointment and despair. He saw his face in the cheval glass opposite him and exclaimed 'That's it,  that's just the expression I want'. Though he modified the story later, Cruikshank did not deny that he fixed the peculiarly effective pose of Fagin by studying himself in a mirror.\n\nThis sketch is either a very early idea for the plate 'Fagin in the Condemned Cell' or a drawing for the cover for the issue of <i>Oliver Twist</i> in parts, by Bradbury and Evans in 1846.'\n",
