Clarke left the V&A to become Director of the Metropolitan Museum in New York. \n\nThe medal\u2019s obverse, first exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1848, is a rare example of collaborative work between the medallist Eug\u00e8ne-Andr\u00e9 Oudin\u00e9 (1810-1887) and the architect Henri Labrouste (1801-1875). Labrouste is best-known for the two libraries he designed in Paris between 1843 and 1867. An important medallist, Oudin\u00e9 was notably influential in training a new generation of artists that would establish France as the leading school of medal-making at the end of the nineteenth century.",

The Kagans purchased this medal, together with two others (lot 6468), at Stack's New York Americana Sale on 26 January 2011.\n\nHistorical significance: A polymath, architect and museum administrator, Caspar Purdon Clarke had a lifelong connection to the South Kensington Museum, from his early years as a student of architecture at the National Art training School in 1862, to his directorship of the Museum (1896-1905).\n\nThe medal's obverse was jointly designed by the medallist Eug\u00e8ne-Andr\u00e9 Oudin\u00e9 (1810-1887) and the architect Henri Labrouste (1801-1875) and first exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1848. In the field, the profile bust of the muse of Architecture is coiffed by buildings and monuments, including a Greek temple, Trajan\u2019s Column and the basilica Saint Peter in Rome and Italian Renaissance buildings. Labrouste probably provided the design of these buildings, while the female profile is closely related to that of the Republic on Oudin\u00e9\u2019s French five piece franc, designed in 1850. This is a rare example of their collaborative work.",
