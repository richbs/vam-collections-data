Cast iron was not produced in quantity in the subcontinent, even by the East India Company, until the late 19th century. Until then the EIC relied on imported shot cast in British foundries. \n\nThis is a comparatively rare example of the mundane military technology of the Indian subcontinent. Produced in large quantities and with little intrinsic value or historical importance they have not survived except in a few citadels and arsenals such as Jaigarh in Rajasthan and Sriringapatna in Mysore. Most cannon balls found in the field are melted down and recycled by the local inhabitants.\n\nHammered iron cannon balls were considered of inferior quality for a number of reasons. The excessive windage (the gap between the projectile and the bore) significantly affected range. The irregular shape also had less range and more unpredictable flight. It also had a scouring effect, damaging the bores of bronze cannon barrels which further reduced accuracy. This particular example has a lead core and is roughly comparable to the shot of a 4pr. It may have originally have had a smoothing skin of clay applied to improve its characteristics.",
