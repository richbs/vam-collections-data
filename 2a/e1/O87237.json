The caricatures were drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years.  Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nDick Whittington starred the ebullient singer and actress Hy Hazell (1922-1970) as Dick.  Hyacinth Hazel O'Higgins made her first West End appearance in the chorus of On Your Toes at the Palace Theatre in 1937. She toured with E.N.S.A during the war and first appeared as principal boy at Sheffield at Christmas 1946.  She made her London debut as principal boy at the Prince's Theatre, December 1949, again as Dick Whittington. She performed in revues and West End musicals including Expresso Bongo (1958) and Fiddler on the Roof  (1970) but liked to be known as: 'English pantomime's most distinguished post-war principal boy.'  The Oxford production of Dick Whittington also featured Reg Varney, better known to television viewers of the early 1970s as Stan Butler in the London Weekend Television classic comedy series On The Buses.",
