            "public_access_description": "In 'piecing' or 'patchwork', small pieces of fabric are sewn together to produce a decorative design.The most enduring method in Britain is done by hand, and is known as 'piecing over paper'. The pattern is first drawn onto paper and then accurately cut. Small pieces of fabric are tacked round each of the shapes, and then joined together from the back using overstitch. Geometric shapes can produce some of the most striking patterns, such as this design of small hexagons. Through the careful arrangement of fabrics, the maker has created an innovative pattern of light and dark zig-zags. A bedcover that has been pieced but not wadded is often referred to as a coverlet.\n\nThis coverlet is a rare example of documented patchwork from the early nineteenth century. An accompanying, hand-written note reveals not only the number of patches and datespan of the work, but also the time and resources required to furnish the fashionable middle class bedroom. Although this is the only known surviving piece, the note suggests that this coverlet was part of a much larger set of hangings and furnishings handstitched between October 1801 and March 1816. It lists 11 separate curtains and valances for the bed, and six for the window. The overall total of patches is 102,148. \n\nSuch extensive and compelx sets of hangings were not unusual at this time.  The Workwoman's Guide of 1838 recommends a similar number of curtains when dressing a four-poster bed. The list includes 'a top, a back, two head curtains, two foot curtains', one top outer and one top inner valance, one bottom valance, and sometimes extra drapery laid on the back of the bed.'",
