He lived for many years at Barbizon, near Fontainebleau. He specialised in large historical pictures from English history, with a particular interest in Puritan scenes, and exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1834 to 1873. Lucy received a premium of \u00a3200 for his painting <u>Embarkation of the Pilgrim Fathers in the ship <i>Mayflower</i> </u> in the Westminster Hall competition of 1847. \n\nIn 1868 Lucy was commissioned to paint a series of portraits of eminent figures. The majority were 19th-century English parliamentarians: Joseph Hume, Richard Cobden, John Bright, Gladstone and Disraeli; also depicted were Oliver Cromwell, Horatio Nelson and Giuseppe Garibaldi. The Liberal MP Sir Joshua Walmsley, who commissioned the series, bequeathed it to the V&A in 1872.",
