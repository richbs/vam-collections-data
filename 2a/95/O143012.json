The traditionally polished surface of gold was no longer fashionable, and instead jewellers played with flame and heat to create new textures and surface finishes. Antony Hawksley's collar neckpiece is typical of this period with its abstract sculptural expression. \n\nMinerals and gemstones were integrated in unique and often asymmetrical cuts. Inexpensive materials were combined with precious metals. The value of a piece of jewellery lay in the imagination of the creator rather than the materials used.\n\nAnthony Hawksley (1921-91) was trained at the Maidstone School of Art, and later the Royal College of Art. In 1951 he exhibited at the Festival of Britain for Goldsmiths' Hall. Hawksley taught silversmithing at Birmingham and Oxford. The Oxford colleges, and in particular Wolfson College, commissioned silver pieces from him.",
