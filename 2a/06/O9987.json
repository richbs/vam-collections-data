The child kneeling on the left, who is nearer to the camera, is a boy with short wavy hair cut in a fringe, who is wearing a light-coloured shirt with a plain dark jumper and trousers; the other child, squatting on the right, is a girl with short straight hair cut in a fringe, who is wearing a light-coloured shirt, dark skirt, white socks and V-bar shoes.",
