To the right of her bed are three Apostles, with a processional cross between them. The dominant figure of the donor kneels in the foreground in front of a coffer, at the base of which is a blank shield.  Behind him is a standing Apostle holding a censer. In the right foreground a praying Apostle stands, while another is seated on a chest reading in a book. Beneath is a moulded panel with the inscription: OBIT?S [OBITVS] BEATISSIM\u00c6 / VIRGINIS MARI\u00c6. [the death of the most blessed Virgin Mary]\nThe stone is much pitted, and is chipped at the edges. Two inlaid disks in the upper corners are of grained light brown marble. The mouldings of the panel and the inscription are painted in gold, the letters lined with red. At the time of acquisition the relief was set in a wood frame which has been removed at an unknown date.",

The sculptor has however omitted the stairs in the foreground and replaced the kneeling Apostle holding a tall processional cross seen from the back with the figure of the donor.\n\nThe relief, which probably formed part of an epitaph, was acquired as German, sixteenth- century. It has certain stylistic analogies with the \u0153uvre of Loy Hering, for instance the Wolfstein altarpiece of about 1520 (Reindl 1977, p. 289), but it lacks the quality of the carving and the clearly defined spatial composition of Hering's works. The weakness of the composition, the repetitive head types of the apostles, and with the conventional scheme of the drapery all indicate that the present relief is either a workshop product or a work by a less experienced stone-mason, as proposed by Reindl.",

            "history_note": "Bought from Carl Anton Milani in Frankfurt-am-Main for \u00a318 10s. in 1859.\n\nThe composition is based on the same scene in D\u00fcrer's woodcuts of the Life of the Virgin, published in 1511 (Bartsch, 1980a, no. 93). The sculptor has however omitted the stairs in the foreground and replaced the kneeling Apostle holding a tall processional cross seen from the back with the figure of the donor.\n\nThe relief, which probably formed part of an epitaph, was acquired as German, sixteenth- century. It has certain stylistic analogies with the \u0153uvre of Loy Hering, for instance the Wolfstein altarpiece of about 1520 (Reindl 1977, p. 289), but it lacks the quality of the carving and the clearly defined spatial composition of Hering's works. The weakness of the composition, the repetitive head types of the apostles, and with the conventional scheme of the drapery all indicate that the present relief is either a workshop product or a work by a less experienced stone-mason, as proposed by Reindl. The doubts Reindl expressed about the authenticity of the piece, however, cannot be sustained.\nProvenance: Bought from Carl Anton Milani in Frankfurt-am-Main for \u00a318 10s. in 1859.",
