            "public_access_description": "Designer Oliver Messel\u2019s feel for grand occasions and fantastic, imaginative approach meant that he was in greawt demand as a designer of temporary decorations for balls, marriage receptions and parties.  Prestigious commissions included decorations for royal boxes for gala performances on state occasions at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, and temporary decorations for the exterior of the Dorchester Hotel, London, on the occasion of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth I in 1953.  Typically, he would transform the setting using luxurious fabrics to disguise architectural lines, and then embellish the fabrics with garlands of flowers and introduce special lighting effects.\n\nThis design is for the Royal Box at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, for the premiere of Benjamin Britten\u2019s opera Gloriana at the Royal Opera House, which celebrated the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth I in on 8 June 1953.  Messel hung a tent-like gold canopy over the three bays and lined the box in pale gold silk made by Sekers, the silk manufacturer.  The balconies were also festooned in green garlands and flowers.  The official Royal Box at the Opera House is, in fact, situated one box away from the stage, which means that, although the public has a good view of the Royal party, they have a very odd view, with most of the stage obscured and directly above the brass section of the orchestra.  Therefore, for most galas from the late 1940s on, a Royal Box was created in the centre of the Grand Tier (equivalent of the Dress Circle in most theatres), which gave the Royal party an excellent view of the full stage.  \n\nGreat Britain\u2019s leading theatre designer from the early 1930s to the mid 1950s, Oliver Messel (1904-1978) won international acclaim for his lavish, painterly and poetic designs informed by period styles.  His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.",
