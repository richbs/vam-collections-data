            "public_access_description": "As gold prices rose in the 1970s, jewellers began to look for alternatives to precious metals. Traditionally, they would have turned to base metals, such as bronze, iron and steel. Now, with the continuous search for the 'new', they sought out a wider repertoire of metals and also innovative techniques to create colour through patina. Silver was oxidised, aluminium anodised and painted. \n\nIn the space industry experiments with new materials led to the development of metals such as titanium and niobium. Their iridescent colours, achieved through heat or electrical currents, soon attracted the attention of jewellery designers.\n\nDe Large studied ceramics at the Camberwell School of Art and later silversmithing at the Royal College of Art, London, where he became interested in titanium. In 1975 he was awarded the Sandersons Art in Industry Award to travel in Japan, where he concentrated on the skills of metal inlay and patination. He went on to develop his own sophisticated and exacting method of anodizing titanium allowing him to achieve a remarkably complex and painterly effect. Variations of colour are created by varying the voltage and timing of the electrical current through the metal, while the sense of perspective is enhanced by polishing and sand-blasting. The fine detail he achieves is the reward of applying the current in a  controlled way through the tip of a modified paintbrush.\n\nThe brooch shows de Large's fascination with flight and perspective, and also the inspiration of the artist Ren\u00e9 Escher. De Large has cited the monolith in Stanley Kubrick's 1968 film '2001: A Space Odyssey' as the inspiration for the shadowy rectangular form visible on the surface of the brooch.",
