The work master of Faberge's enamelling workshop in Moscow, Ruckert was known for his skill in cloisonne enamelling, a technique which was unique to the Moscow workshopp.\n\nThe shape of the pot is not unlike a Faberge egg which has sprouted a handle and spout. Like the famous eggs, the ornate decoration of the teapot makes it an ornamental piece rather than a practical object. The busy intricate pattern of a mixture of floral and geometric forms is derived from the Old Russian style, which had its beginnings in the 17th century. Enjoying a revival at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries, this style was linked to Russian nationalism and suited Faberge's more traditional customers.  Ruckert's designs with unusually muted colours had a modern touch to them and some had suggestions of more Art Nouveau influenced forms.",
