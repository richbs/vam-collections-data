The four corners of the case are fashioned as angle-pilasters with female terminal figures; the ends each have a medallion enclosing a figure of Faith, surrounded by cartouche-work. The cover is formed of strapwork, demi-figures and grotesque ornament; a dolphin ornament remains at one corner. The splayed base is decorated with cupids and bunches of fruit. The space around the dials on back and front is occupied by figures of astrologers and emblematic figures, finely engraved, and by two medallions with figures of St. Luke and St. John in relief. The works are of steel. Many parts are wanting including all the hands, parts of the dials, three dolphins from the cover and a figure from the top.",
