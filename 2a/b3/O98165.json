The manufacture of artefacts from imported jade seems to have developed quickly at the court from the beginning of the 17th century, probably as a result of the presence of the Iranian superintendent of the royal goldsmiths' department,  Sa'ida-ye Gilani. He was as renowned for his skill at working hardstones as he was for his goldsmithing and enamelling, and was also a calligrapher and poet.\n\nThe cup was originally part of the extensive collection of Mughal hardstones formed by  Colonel Charles Seton Guthrie (1808-1874). He had served in the Indian Army, in the Bengal Engineers, and returned to Britain in 1857. It is not known whether he formed his collection in India, or after his retirement through agents in India. This piece was bought from Guthrie by the Indian Museum in 1868, and was transferred to the South Kensington Museum (later renamed the Victoria and Albert Museum) in 1879.",
