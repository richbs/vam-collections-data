The  collection, which includes ceramics (S.932-1996 to S.1101-1996), architectual plans, architectual Drawing and watercolours, prints, Drawing, rare books and wax figures, was built up by Robert Eddison following World War II, with acquisitions from well-known London dealers and from country outlets visited while on tour. It was regarded as one of the finest collections of Georgian theatrical material in private hands, a high proportion of the material being rare or unique and of national importance. The collection was acquired by the Theatre Museum from the Executors of Robert Eddison as an Acceptance in lieu of Inheritance Tax.",
