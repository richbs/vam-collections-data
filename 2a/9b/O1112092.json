His first commission after graduating from the Slade School of Fine Art was to design Giselle at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in 1946.  He also created notable settings and costumes for Shakespeare productions, including a 'Victorian' Hamlet at Stratford-upon-Avon in 1948, and an As You Like It on Broadway in 1950 which gave Katharine Hepburn her first Shakespearean role. This design was created for the New York production, directed by British director Michael Benthall: 'a bright, lovely production, with fairy-story settings, exquisite costumes and plenty of music and song', said the New York World-Telegram (27 January 1950).",
