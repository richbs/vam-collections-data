The Temple was built for Charles Fitzroy, 2nd Duke of Grafton, in 1755. By architect and designer William Kent (1685-1748) and John Vardy (1718-1765).\n\nKent visited Rome in 1715 where he met Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington who became his patron. Boyle encouraged Kent\u2019s interest in architecture when they returned to London together and Kent soon started receiving commissions for buildings and furniture in the classical style. His most famous buildings include Holkham Hall, Norfolk, and the Horse Guards, Whitehall.",
