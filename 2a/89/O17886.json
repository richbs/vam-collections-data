Brush-work is evident in parts of the image.\n\nOwnership & Use\nThis photograph formed part of the 19th-century collection of Chauncy Hare Townshend. His photographs adorned the walls of his London home or were kept in portfolios and presses. He bequeathed many of the best items in his collection to the Museum in 1868.\n\nPeople\nPrincess Beatrice, the youngest child of Queen Victoria and Albert, the Prince Consort,  was born in April 1857. Soon after the birth, the Queen and her family went to stay at their retreat, Osborne House, on the Isle of Wight, off the southern coast of England. The family were photographed there in May by the photographer Caldesi who was summoned from London.\n\nMaterials & Making\nImages of the royal family were often retouched by painting directly on to a photographic print. The effect was to enhance tones or colours and to flatter the sitters. The resulting hybrid painted photograph was often re-photographed for wide and popular distribution.",
