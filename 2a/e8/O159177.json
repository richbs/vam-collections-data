It contains a fine meandering stem linking a pink 4-petalled flower with a pair of leaves and a large group of 3 blue leaves. In the centre of the green ground is a large ogee with a pendant above and below.  These have a gold ground and the pendants contain a large silver flower with a pink flower in the centre with a silver flower similar to these in the pendants and to those either side of the pendants. Between the flowers in the ogee are four running hares with pink ears. To either side of the pendants is a large bird in gold metal thread with pink and blue details.  A pair of floral stems emerge from each side of the ogee and from the top and the bottom of it.\nThere is evidence down the right hand side of a red silk backing.\nMetal Thread: silver and silver-gilt, cannot ascertain exact structure.",
