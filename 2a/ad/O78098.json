They have been made to commemorate events such as Frost Fairs, held on the ice when the River Thames froze, to celebrate coronations and christenings, as memorials of the plague in the 17th century and, more recently, as holiday souvenirs. These spoons are an example of the wide range of commemorative objects produced for the Great Exhibition, to cater for all tastes and incomes.\n\nHistorical Associations\nThe spoons are decorated with a view of the Crystal Palace, which housed the Great Exhibition. The Crystal Palace was designed by Sir Joseph Paxton (1801-1865), a horticulturalist, garden designer and architect. Erected in Hyde Park, London,  it covered 18 acres and was built from sheet glass, wood and metal. When opened to the public on 1 May 1851, it received great praise. As one of the most innovative and impressive buildings of its day, it was a fitting subject for commemorative wares.",
