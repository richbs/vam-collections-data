In this textile, however, they have been adapted to the resist- and mordant-dyed technique practiced in South-East India (today's coastal Andhra Pradesh), but also on a cloth for export to South-East Asia - Thailand, in this case. This piece has probably been converted into a wrapper for manuscripts from a cut-down shoulder-cloth, and lined with European fabric. The presence of some holes in the field of the textile suggest that it may have been worn out, but was a highly prized type of cloth that was re-used rather than discarded.",
