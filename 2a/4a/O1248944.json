During conservation work, a new base for the annex was made so it could sit flush against the main house). \nThe main body of the house is a wooden two storey mock Tudor style house. The outside walls have a white painted stippled effect with three front facing pitched roofs two dormer windows in the roof. The house has metal frames windows painted white. The house is assembled on a green painted base board.\n[annex] The annex used to be a part of the complete house until, sometime in its former ownership, it was cut it off, presumably because it took up too much space. The annex now has a replacement base board to match with the rest of the house (made by V&A conservation). The annex itself sits on the left-hand facing side of the house and it is slightly recessed back from the main body of the house to allow for a wooden double garage door to open in the back opening section of the house.\nThe front of the annex has a covered, balustraded walkway around the front of the garage with a green door on the outer edge which leads to a staircase servicing an upstairs room, presumed to be for the chauffeur. \nFrom the back, the annex has a hinged opening that reveals the room above the garage with stairs coming up the right hand facing side and a side aspect window on the left and the right and two in the drop down section interior has been painted pale blue and the floor has a paper printed covering made to resemble parquet flooring.\n[rooms] In the main house there are 8 rooms. When facing the back of the house, the top right hand room is the bathroom, with the kitchen below. Then, right to left along the ground floor follow a dining room, then a main hallway and then a living room.\nOn the first floor the bathroom leads to a bedroom, then a landing and then another master bedroom.",
