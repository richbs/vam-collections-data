The campaign focussed on the work and pastimes of the men who worked at the Glenmorangie Distillery, so artist George Tute (born 1933) was sent to meet the individuals who worked there. Examples from the series are at E.4041-1995 to E.4044-1995. Colour proofs of this example can be seen at E.744-1994 and E.745-1994 respectively.",
