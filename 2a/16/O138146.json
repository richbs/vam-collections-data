The complete outfit consisted of a \u2018Zulu Nation\u2019 baseball cap; the suit; an \u2018African-American Alumni\u2019 cotton sweatshirt; three pendants and \u2018Timberland\u2019 leather boots. The outfit reflected a style of \u2018Afrocentric B-Boy\u2019 dress worn by young men in Britain around 1990.\n\n\u2018Afrocentric\u2019 describes the celebration of African culture by African-Americans in the late 1980s. The movement was popularised by US bands such as Arrested Development, Jungle Brothers and A Tribe Called Quest whose clothes and accessories reflected their African heritage. This outfit includes a pendant in the shape of the African continent, a jacket and trousers with kente-cloth style edging and a string of \u2018trade beads\u2019 (glass beads historically made in Europe for trade in West Africa). \n\n\u2018B-Boy\u2019 was the name given to young, urban African-Americans associated with the Rap and Hip-Hop scene. The term came into usage in Britain through hit singles by Run DMC and the Beastie Boys. It was associated with labelled sports clothes, specific brands of trainers, baseball caps and chunky jewellery.",
