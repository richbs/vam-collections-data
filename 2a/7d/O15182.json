Cobalt-blue pigment was used to paint designs on the white porcelain, then the piece was glazed and finally fired. Underglaze iron oxide was used for creating designs on celadons during the Koryo dynasty (918-1392), but this became especially popular in the 17th century. Underglaze copper-red decoration was first developed in the 12th century, but was virtually unused until  the 18th century.",
