It shows the developing style for radios in the late 1930s, which was moving away from the more crude, industrial-looking radio sets previously available. The upright body with rounded edges has a distinctively Art Deco look, whilst the grid-form grill and near round knobs on the front give it an almost personified appearance.\n\nRadios were prize possessions at this time. Either built-in or in a separate casing, they took a prominent position in the living room on a table, or smaller models on the mantelpiece.\n\nBakelite was the first totally synthetic plastic. Developed in America, it was commercially produced from 1916 and it created the plastics compression moulding industry. In Britain it was used extensively in dark colours, as a cheap substitute for wood in goods such as radio cabinets and pens; in America it was more popularly used in bright colours.",
