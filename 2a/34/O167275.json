The festival was not an annual occurrence, but one of a series of large scale gigs. This particular event, known as Oh No, Not Another Boring Old Knebworth from the poster campaign that accompanied the festival, was one of the smallest concerts ever held in the grounds. Nevertheless, there were still crowds of over 40,000, travelling across the country to see Frank Zappa, The Tubes and Peter Gabriel.\n\nWith t-shirts becoming a staple fashion item for youth and rock 'n' rollers in the 1960s, promotional t-shirts printed to advertise products also became common place. This trend moved from corporate arena to youth movement with the merging of rock 'n' roll, advertising and fashion into creation of the concert t-shirt, of which this is an example. Not only does it advertise a concert the wearer has been to, but concert and band t-shirts can also show the wearer's allegiance to specific musical subcultures or youth movements.",
