In the days before radio and television, comedians were often famous within a fairly restricted area and humour, too, showed many local variations - there were many comedians famous in the north of England who never performed in the south, and vice versa.  \nThis jacket and skirt was worn by Judge as a pantomime dame.  It is made of a patterned cotton that is typical of the late 19th century.  From his costumes, it is clear that Judge's dames were elegant or homely rather than grotesque caricatures.  Most dames had their own costumes and wore them in many different pantomimes.  Such costumes were not 'designed' in the formal sense, but rather evolved in the making and it was probably the work of a member of Judge's family rather than a professional costume maker.",

Although he performed all over the British Isles, occasionally in London, he was best known in East Anglia and the North of England; at this period, before the spread of radio and the invention of television, comedians were often 'local' and humour in the North could be very different from that in the South (for example, Max Miller was never as popular in the North of England, while Jimmy Learmouth was most popular in his native Lancashire).  He played Dame in pantomime and married Gertrude Orchard, who played Principal Boy.  His Dame characters, while obviously exaggerated, inclined towards the 'elegant' or homely rather than the grotesque. Such costumes were not 'designed' in the formal sense, but rather evolved in the making; the making, too, could be domestic rather than professional at a period when most girls were taught to sew.",
