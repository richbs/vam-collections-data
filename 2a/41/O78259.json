They married in 1641. Margaret was stepmother to the six children from Sir William's previous marriage to Lady Katherine Bertie, daughter of the Earl of Lindsey. Lady Katherine died in 1637, shortly after the birth of her sixth child.\n\nLady Paston's dress is simple but fashionable. She is wearing a pearl necklace and earrings, the favoured jewel of the time. The plain bodice of her dress is enhanced by sleeves of rich fabric with jewelled clasps. Her hair is arranged in soft, shoulder-length ringlets, a popular style in fashionable circles.\n\nThis flattering and glamorous portrait of Lady Paston belies the experiences that she and so many men and women of her generation underwent during the English Civil War of 1642-1646. In March 1643 Sir William Paston had crossed over to The Netherlands to join a group of Royalist East Anglian gentlemen. Lady Paston remained in the family home at Oxnead Hall, Norfolk. In June of the same year Parliament confiscated the Paston estates because of Sir William's defection.  This confiscation (or sequestration, as it was called) of Royalist estates and rents left the wives and children of Royalist supporters completely destitute. In August 1643 Parliament passed a decree  for the benefit of these dependants, setting aside a special sum of one- fifth of the sequestered income. Lady Paston received \u00a31,119. Her troubles, however, were not over. In December she gave up some of the family plate (precious metalwork) worth \u00a31,100 to the Parliamentary cause, in return for a certificate of protection for the remainder.",
