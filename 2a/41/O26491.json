From the design it is probable that the game was played in the following manner.\nThe game is a hand coloured etching, 9 panels mounted on linen. \nThe title is across the top and the publisher's details at the bottom.  The game is in three parts.  At the top are numbered medallions, each showing a portrait of sovereign with the name of the European country.  The exception is the German States which are only listed.  Queen Victoria is in the centre, No. 6.  The central part of the game is a map of Europe and Russia; they are numbered but not named to match the sovereigns; major cities are shown.  Around three sides of the game are 40 squares in two layers.  Each square is dated and illustrated and linked by a chain design.  The starting date is 1688 and the finishing one 1844-5.  Some of the squares have recognizable subjects, for example 1834 the abolition of slavery.\n\nThere is no booklet and the rules were probably written in it.  The game is probably played with a teetotum and markers.  The players move from one square to another, must read out the details found in the booklet and match the country, event illustrated and sovereign.\n\nRules placement: booklet",
