It includes the line at the end 'give the scraps and heads to the nearest cat'. Artist Tatyana Kozmina lives with her husband in the village of Staraya Ladoga on the west bank of the River Volkhov, close to the southern shores of Lake Lagoda in Russia in a small wooden house and her subject matter is inspired by village life. \n\nDuring the bleakest years of the Soviet regime many communities survived through extremely careful, ingenious and resourceful use of local materials, whether that be wild animals and plants or carefully tended kitchen gardens. Systems of exchange were commonplace at a time when commercial trade through shops and with hard cash was virtually impossible.",
