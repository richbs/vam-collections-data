It is a fine example of the lustre-painted pottery produced in Egypt under the Fatimid dynasty, who ruled there from 969 to 1171. The jar has a rounded shape and a tall neck with a rim that turns outwards. The low foot-ring is unglazed. \nThe decoration is in yellowish-lustre over an opaque glaze. The design on the main body consists of three wide bands filled with different patterns. The bottom wide band has a lustre ground with interlace decoration in the body colour. The larger middle band is dominated by a row of palmettes. These appear in the body colour in the lustre ground of an inverted heart-shaped cartouche. The wide band at the top features a row of five fishes with details of their bodies scratched through the lustre. The narrower bands decorating the neck include one filled with reciprocating triangles. It has been suggested that the band of five fishes 'swimming' around the shoulder of this vessel is a Christian motif. However, it is more likely that the decorator thought fishes appropriate for an object used to store water or other liquids.",
