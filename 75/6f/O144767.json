            "public_access_description": "Michael Annals (1938-1990) trained at Hornsey College of Art and began his career designing sets and costumes for the Old Vic. In 1963 he went to work for the newly formed National Theatre Company and had his first major success with his designs for Peter Shaffer's historical epic, The Royal Hunt of the Sun (1964). Annals went on to have an international career, designing for the theatre and for ballet, opera and film,  but he is most closely associated with the National Theatre, where he worked until the early 1970s. In 1971 he created a notable setting for the National's production of  Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey into Night, which starred Laurence Olivier and was directed by Michael Blakemore. This began a working relationship with Blakemore which lasted for 12 years. Annals frequently worked in the United States and was Associate Professor of Scenic Design at Yale in 1966-1967. In 1984 he gave up the stage and took up photography and illustration.\n\nAs he demonstrated in The Royal Hunt of the Sun, Annals's designs could be highly imaginative and emblematic but the greater part of his work showed his ability to represent reality in theatrical terms. His set model for Long Day's Journey's into Night shows the 'Living Room of James Tyrone's summer home' in 1912. Eugene O'Neill based the Tyrones on his own family, with James Tyrone, the retired actor who never fulfilled his potential, being a portrait of O'Neill's father.  A naturalist setting was required and, as no scene changes are necessary, the set could be substantial and detailed. Annals found that the stage directions, which specified two sets of doors on each side of the stage, fitted oddly with the action of the play and re-arranged the layout of the room. After the play opened in America, Michael Annals visited the O'Neill family home in Connecticut and discovered that his design faithfully mirrored the real house.",
