The concave recess at the top of the mirror was probably for a watch movement; at the side and the front are two apertures, possibly for a clockwork movement or musical box.\n\nTrading\nTwo of these complex mirror stands are known, and both can be identified with descriptions of important lots included in London auctions of Chelsea porcelain. This one was probably the 'Lady's Toilet' of 1758; the other was probably the 'Lady's Toilet with a Looking Glass and Gold Instruments' mentioned in a newspaper notice of 1763. The Chelsea factory aimed at the top end of the market. It sold its wares from the factory premises, from factory-run warehouses in the West End of London, through London ceramics dealers, and at auctions held in London, Dublin and probably elsewhere.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe mirror was probably designed under the direction of Nicholas Sprimont (1716-1771), the manager of the Chelsea porcelain factory and a skilful draughtsman and designer. Writing before 1752, a Swiss painter noted that Sprimont 'supplies or directs the models of everything made at the factory'.",
