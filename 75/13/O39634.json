He is dressed as an archbishop with a pallium, a chasuble with a highly decorated collar and beaded borders, a long stole with tassels, an alb with splits at the sides and beaded sleeves. From underneath the alb protrudes one foot in a sandal; the other is broken off. On his head is a triangular mitre, which came into fashion after ca. 1150. The face has a smooth surface with a line marking the beard. There are concentric folds on the chasuble. The figure, full of dignity and decorum, projects from a flat background. The reverse of the stone is carved with a shallow cross with splayed arms interlacing with a wheel, this motif has been compared to a motif on the Kelloe reliquary cross.",

He accompanied Christ in his ministry, he lead the Apostles in their teaching of the gospels and went to Rome and established a Christian community and was Crucified by Nero 64AD. His appearance here wearing the vestments of an archbishop is a reference to his position as the first bishop of Rome. When paired with Saint Paul as this figure was at Ivychurch Priory, the two represent the pillars of the church.\n\nThe priory of Ivychurch was founded in the parish of Alderbery, south east of Salisbury in Wiltshire. A small Minster, a dependant chapel of Alderberry church , stood on the site before the foundation of the priory and became the priory church. It was originally an Augustinian Priory of St. Mary. No foundation charter is known and the earliest evidence of the priory comes from the Hundred Rolls for 1274, in which the jurors of Alderbery name King Stephen as the founder. The priory was certainly a royal foundation and the fact that it is mentioned in the first pipe rolls of Henry II seems to confirm the jurors claim. Never receiving great endowments the priory nevertheless enjoyed privileges in the adjacent royal Clarendon Park. After the Dissolution it came into the hands of Henry, Earl of Pembroke, who converted it into a dwelling, which was later occupied by royalists during the civil war. Much of the priory building including the original twelfth century cloisters remained standing until 1888 when it was pulled down. A farm house with many reclaimed sculpted stones now stands on part of the site and it was on the outside of the end wall of this house that the figures of Saints Peter & Paul were positioned.",
