(Hussey) bought it from a house which was being demolished\".\n\nOn Further Inspection Edwards \ndetermined that the arms were apparently of the first Earl of Coventry.  He describes the condition as \"bad\".  \n\"\u2026two wooden battens have been fractured on the inlaid surface; the veneer has disappeared in several places and is damaged in others; the edges are ragged where the floor has been torn out.  There is however no doubt that the defects could be made good, and the condition is no worse than that of several pieces of veneered furniture from Boughton.\n\nRegarding Use\n\"The suggested use is to form a plinth to support examples of contemporary furniture, and the size is suitable for this purpose.  Mr Clifford Smith agrees that it would be a very effective way of displaying some of our early 18th century examples\".\n\n26/4/27 Brackett requests approval for acceptance from the Director\nstating \"This is the floor of a staircase (English; early 18th century) inlaid with shield of arms, stars etc.  It is both interesting and will be an important acquisition\u2026.\"",
