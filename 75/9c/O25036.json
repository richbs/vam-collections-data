The head of the Garuda is turned slightly to the left and wears a turban suggesting the royal status of the Garuda; this is emphasised by the earrings which he also wears. He clasps Queen Kakati to his chest with his talons and since her feet are shown clear of the ground, the group appears to be already in the air. Kakati wears a loose robe with a jewelled belt, necklace, earrings and anklets; her hair is held by a jewelled  fillet.\nThis episode is described in one of the Buddha's previous-life stories, the Jatakas.  The Queen of Varanasi is carried by the mythical bird, only to be returned unharmed after her king (the Boddhisattva in fact) performs an act of selfless kindness.",
