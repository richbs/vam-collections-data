There are three minor initials, one in red ink (E), the others (C and B) in black ink with red and black ink decoration. Above each line of text are four horizontal lines equal distance apart, ruled in red ink.  These lines carry the appropriate musical notation, written in black ink.  Further text, smaller in size and mainly in red ink, occurs at the end of the fifth line of the main body of text and in the lower and left page margins.\n\nThe page has an historiated initial \u2018D' the centre of which shows the Virgin flanked by the Apostles with the Holy Ghost (the Pentecost).\n\nThe initial is enclosed on three sides by a blue painted border encased within a gilded surround.  Both the blue and the gold extend into the margins of the page fusing with a decorated bar-border running along the left, upper and lower margins, each end of which becomes a foliate branch bearing tri-pointed leaves with a bird perched on it (in the case of the lower branch this may be a heron).  The same tri-pointed leaves extend from the stem of the initial \u2018D\u2019 itself into the left margin. \n\nA small female figure dressed in the habit of a Franciscan nun appears in an attitude of prayer in the margin next to the historiated initial \u2018D\u2019. This is Heylwigis von Beechoven, Abbess at the Convent of St Klara at the time the manuscript was produced.  A pair of small hybrid grotesques facing one another are perched on the upper and lower bar borders, a fifth, slightly larger one, occurs beneath the stem of the letter \u2018D\u2019.",

            "public_access_description": "An Antiphonal contains the choral parts sung during the celebration of the Divine Office or Mass celebrated by a monastic or other community. This type of choirbook was usually written in large format so that the whole choir could read the music at once. This example was made at the convent of St Klara in Cologne by one of the nuns, Sister Loppa de Speculo. Another surviving leaf records that Sister Jutta paid for the book while Loppa carried out the writing, lining (putting in the staves for the music), notation and illumination 'in the year 1350, when there was a great plague everywhere'. This was one of a series of books produced in the convent. The Abbess, Heylwigis von Beechoven, who had ruled the convent since 1344, is portrayed kneeling by the historiated initial of the Descent of the Holy Ghost on the Virgin and Apostles associating her prayer with this crucial event, when the Holy Spirit came to earth and the mission of the Apostles to spread the Christian revelation began. The prayer of her convent was thus part of the mission.\n\nIf we take at face value the claim that Sister Loppa did all the illumination (it is always possible that parts of it were contracted out, paid for by Sister Jutta), it appears that grotesques and birds (a heron seems to be shown) were the accepted form of ornament even in this convent environment. The initial looks German, but the three pointed leaves on their swirling stems may show an effort to copy Parisian or other French styles. Other leaves from this manuscript are in Stockholm and in Cologne itself, collected by the founders of the Wallraf-Richartz Museum who wanted to assemble works to show the antiquity of a local school of painting.",

            "history_note": "This manuscript leaf was one of a group of seemingly unrelated leaves purchased from W. H. J. Weale on April 9th 1883.  As a whole, the group cost \u00a326.17.6.  Individually, this leaf cost 2 shillings.\n\nThe entry in the Register of Drawings 1880 to 1884 (museum numbers 8526 to 11002) lists the leaf as:\n\n<i>One leaf with storied versal: D, the Descent of the Holy Ghost, and an abbess of the Order of S. Francis, Sovor Heyl-wigis, kneeling. Netherlandish, xiv cent.</i>\n\nHistorical significance: The Antiphonal this leaf comes from was one of a number of manuscripts produced at the convent of St Klara in Cologne. Another surviving leaf from the same manuscript states that it was paid for by one of the nuns, Sister Jutta, and that another of the nuns, Sister Loppa de Speculo, carried out the writing, \u2018lining\u2019 (putting in the staves for the music), notation and illumination \u2018in the year 1350, when there was a great plague everywhere\u2019.\n\nThe figure kneeling next to the historiated initial \u2018D\u2019 is Heylwigis von Beechoven, the abbess who had ruled the convent since 1344. Rowan Watson suggests that by being portrayed next to this particular initial the abbess associates her prayer with the \u2018crucial event when the Holy Spirit came to earth and the mission of the Apostles to spread the Christian revelation began\u2019 (Pentecost).  In doing so he says \u2018the prayer of her convent was thus part of the mission\u2019.  \n\nSuch layers of meaning and significance through the careful layout of the page were common during the middle ages and would have been readily recognised by a contemporary audience.  It was also not unusual to include portraits of people connected with the manufacture of a specific manuscript on its pages.  However, in this case it is interesting that the kneeling figure is neither the person who paid for the manuscript nor the person who wrote/illuminated it.\n\nAccording to Watson, the historiated initial \u2018looks German, but the three-pointed leaves on their swirling stems may show an effort to copy Parisian or other French styles\u2019.  It is possible that examples of such \u2018foreign\u2019 styles came to the convent through other books given as gifts or by travelling itinerant artists.  It is also possible that Sister Loppa did not undertake all the work on the manuscript herself \u2013 parts of it may have been contracted out.  Either way, it appears that hybrid grotesques and birds (seen in the borders) were an accepted form of ornament even in this convent environment.\n\nOther leaves from the manuscript are in Stockholm and Cologne (Wallraf-Richartz Museum).",

            "historical_context_note": "<b><u>Background to Music and Christian Liturgy</u></b> \n\nMusic was incorporated into the Christian Liturgy early on and had been influenced by the use of music in the synagogue.  Plainchant (unison singing, originally unaccompanied) was the traditional music of the western Church and from about 1000, vocal polyphony (music with two or more melodically independent parts) was being practiced.  Polyphony made certain chants of the Mass longer and more complex.\n\nThe notation of liturgical music initially appears in the form of <i>neumes</i> - graphic symbols written above the text and indicating the rise and fall of melodic movement or repetitions of the same pitch.  From the 11th century they were commonly written on a four-line staff.  Two hundred years later, eastern European music manuscripts adopted <i>Gothic notation</i>, produced with a thick, square-cut nib, with the points and curves of neumes being replaced by broader, more angular forms.  A similar development in the \u00cele de France gave rise to the use of <i>square notation</i> in the late twelfth century, especially in France and Italy.\n\n<b><u>Music Manuscripts</u></b> \n\nThere are many different types of medieval music manuscripts including the Gradual, Kyriale, Sequentiary, Troper, Missal, Antiphonal, Hymnal and Breviary.  \n\nThe <b>Antiphonal</b> (also called an antiphoner or antiphonary) contains the sung portion of the Divine Office (cycle of daily devotions - the prayers of the canonical hours - performed by members of religious orders and the clergy).  Antiphonals were often large in format so that they could be used by a choir. \n \n\nThe above is adapted from <i>Understanding Illuminated Manuscripts: A Guide to Technical Terms</i> by Michelle P.
