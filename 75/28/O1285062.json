Most commonly, it refers to one of the two circus buildings in Moscow, the \u201cCircus Nikulin\u201d (the old circus, featuring animal acts) and the \u201cBolshoi Circus\u201d (the new circus, featuring trapeze and acrobatics), or to traveling shows which may or may not be directly related to Russia.\n\nThe Russian Circus rose to world acclaim during the Soviet period, when acts from many Russian circuses united to tour the United States under the title, \u201cThe Moscow Circus.\u201d During this time, the circus, which was already important became an even more prominent piece of culture, and a point of pride. Russian Circus traditions include clowning, juggling, acrobatics, contortion, and animal acts.\n\nStylistically, the Soviet circuses were different from their Western counterparts. Their acts were more focused on Eastern European culture, and tended to hold more narrative and be more dance oriented than their bespangled, action-packed contemporaries. This narrative style has recently become more popular with shows worldwide, with shows by companies including Cirque Dreams and Cirque Du Soleil.",
