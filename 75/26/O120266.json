This dish probably formed part of an extensive set of matching table-wares, made for Cardinal d'Avalos. Another dish with the same arms was lent to the South Kensington Museum (now V&A) in 1862.\n\nThe typical decoration of this dish, composed of small loosely connected motifs including human figures, animals and fantasy figures is called 'Grotesque'. It was first introduced by the painter Raphael in his decoration of the Vatican Palace in Rome (1518-19). It was derived from ancient Roman decorations from the Golden House of the emperor Nero (ruled 54-68 AD) on the Esquiline hill in Rome, which came to light during this period.\nDuring the second half of the 16th century, the potters of Urbino specialised in a refined style of decoration incorporating elaborate grotesques on a white ground.",

            "historical_context_note": "Cardinal d'Avalos was son of Alfonso, Marquis of Pescara (d. 1546) and his wife Maria d'Aragona, of the Dukes of Montalto; He was made Cardinal in 1561 and died in 1600. This dish probably formed part of an extensive set of matching table-wares, made for Cardinal Inigo. Another dish with the same arms was lent to the South Kensington Museum (now V&A) in 1862 and is now in a private collection. \n\nThe typical decoration of this dish, composed of small loosely connected motifs including human figures, animals and fantasy figures is called 'Grotesque'. It was first introduced by the painter Raphael in his decoration of the Vatican Palace in Rome (1518-19). It was derived from ancient Roman decorations from the Golden House of the emperor Nero (ruled 54-68 AD) on the Esquiline hill in Rome, which came to light during this period.\nDuring the second half of the 16th century, the potters of Urbino specialised in a refined style of decoration incorporating elaborate grotesques on a white ground. Their main pictorial source of inspiration were the etchings by Jacques Androuet I Ducerceau, which were published in 1550, and again in 1562 under the name 'Petites Grotesques'.",
