Many combination weapons combined the growing popularity of firearms with an already proven and familiar weapon design, in this case a spear\n\nIn Europe and Asia from the 1500s there was an explosion of innovative and unusual designs produced to incorporate this new technology, often sponsored by heads of state though  their popularity seems to have been universal.  \n\nThis weapon incorporates an early 19th century percussion mechanism activated by a spring-loaded spear point. The use of a crossbar resembles a Boar spear which may suggest it was intended for hunting. In Europe pistol swords were used for hunting wounded wild boar. Alternatively it resembles Chinese pistol spears and fire lances that were used to repel attackers from ramparts.",
