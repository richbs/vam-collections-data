This is an example of a woman\u2019s gown from the period 1795 to 1800. Open down the front with a narrow overlapping bodice, the gown would have been worn over a petticoat and with neckerchief. The silk dates from a decade earlier, 1780\u201390, although there is no indication of it being refashioned from an older garment. The length of the sleeves is somewhat old-fashioned, a longer sleeve having come into fashion in the 1780s. Such a combination of latest style waistline with an older fabric and sleeve length illustrates an intriguing mix of fashionable and conservative elements. These probably reflect the individual tastes and resources of the original wearer, rather than the fashion of the time.",
