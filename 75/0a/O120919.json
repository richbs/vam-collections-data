It was then that he gave my Father the casket, which contained the miniature Koran which was the \"mascot\" of the old king [IM.18-1912]. Sir Theophilus himself took it from the table beside the king's bed, to the old king's great grief - why it was taken from him I do not know\". \nLetter dated 10.6. 37.\nMiss Cannon had previously offered the casket (with the Koran as a gift) to the museum in February 1912, but it had not been accepted. The provenance is the same whether given in 1912 or 1937, but the association between box and Koran is not necessarily correct: the box was found on the king's table, and the Koran beneath his pillow.",
