Recent researches have attributed it to Mattia di Nanni (1403\u20131433), the most outstanding pupil of Domenico di Niccol\u00f2, Siena\u2019s leading intarsia specialist of his day. After the sudden death in 1402 of Giangaleazzo Visconti, the Milanese tyrant who had tried to impose his rule throughout Northern and Central Italy, Siena adopted a civic form of government, the virtues of which were extolled in a series of decorations carried out in the Palazzo Pubblico between 1415 and 1430. Mattia\u2019s contribution was to execute a large bench decorated with inlaid panels of heroes of the Ancient Roman Republic for the Sala del Mappomundo (Chamber of the map of the world). Judging from style, technique and subject (note that Justice is depicted holding a map of the world as well as a sword), Mattia almost certainly made this panel of Justice for a pulpit or elevated chair, which also belonged to this room at the time.",

Mattia di Nanni (1403\u20131433) almost certaily executed it as part of his decorations of the Palazzo Pubblico of Siena, carried out between 1415 and 1430, in praise of civic government. This was adopted by Siena after the death in 1402 of Giangaleazzo Visconti, the Milanese tyrant who had tried to impose his rule throughout Northern and Central Italy. Both Mattia and his teacher, Domenico di Niccol\u00f2 (c. 1363 - 1450/53) are the only woodworkers known to have used the technique of creating <i>intarsia</i> drappery patterns and flesh tones with laminated woods, and this panel is perhaps the finest example. In addition, Mattia showed himself to be a master of perspective in his representation of the floor with a highly complex geometrical pattern.",

Until the 1430s, the leading centre of inlay or <i>intarsia</i> was Siena, and the style Gothic. The most outstanding exponents of intarsia were Domenico di Niccol\u00f2 (c. 1363 - 1450/53) and his brilliant pupil, Mattia di Nanni  (1403\u20131433), who decorated the Sala del Mappomundo (Chamber of the map of the world) of the Palazzo Pubblico of Siena between 1415 and 1430 with a series of inlaid panels of heroes of the Ancient Roman Republic, and almost certainly the panel of Justice as well.",
