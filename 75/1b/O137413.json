This ewer may have been originally accompanied by a large basin to assist with hand washing.  It is designed in the fashionable R\u00e9gence style which emerged in Paris in the late 17th century and was brought to England by Huguenot goldsmiths.  Typical features of the style included cut-card work (flat sheets of pierced silver applied to plain surfaces) and gadrooning (borders of convex ribs).  Although this ewer is made by the most celebrated of 18th century silversmiths, Paul de Lamerie, it is also a duty `dodger'.  English silver was taxed by weight after 1720.  To avoid paying tax on larger, heavier objects (weighed when the piece was being marked by the assay office), marks were sometimes cut out from smaller, lighter pieces and added to avoid them going through the assay office.  In 1944 the transposed marks for this piece were removed and the ewer was re-marked.\n<i>M.16-1954</i>"

This ewer may have been originally accompanied by a large basin to assist with hand washing.  It is designed in the fashionable R\u00e9gence style which emerged in Paris in the late 17th century and was brought to England by Huguenot goldsmiths.  Typical features of the style included cut-card work work (flat sheets of pierced silver applied to plain surfaces) and gadrooning (borders of convex ribs).  Although this ewer is made by the most celebrated of 18th century silversmiths, Paul de Lamerie, it is also a duty `dodger'.  English silver was taxed by weight after 1720.  To avoid paying tax on larger, heavier objects (weighed when the piece was being marked by the assay office), marks were sometimes cut out from smaller, lighter pieces and added to avoid them going through the assay office.  In 1944 the transposed marks for this piece were removed and the ewer was re-marked.",

Sent in for sale to Christie's by a Mrs Motion and catalogued as Lot 66 in the sale of 09/06/1943.    Withdrawn in consequence of a complaint that the marks were transposed (which they proved to be when the foot was removed).  Put up for sale (without marks) by another auctioneer in 1944 and seized by the Goldsmiths' Company .  Submitted to the Antique Plate Committee on 26/06/1944 and ordered to be marked as a modern piece.  The Company retained the disc showing the original  hallmarks.\n\nThe gilding was probably done since 1944 but before the ewer entered the Museum.",
