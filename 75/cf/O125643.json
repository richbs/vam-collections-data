He experiments with different textures and media, sometimes using rubber stamps made from his drawings.  Old book covers and paper reappear as canvases, with evidence of their former use deliberately exposed.  He told online magazine Pixelsurgeon, 'I began cutting apart and collaging old tearsheets of mine to create new pictures. There was a spontaneous, raw and tactile reaction I had ... The rawer look of the new pictures was very exciting to me.'",
