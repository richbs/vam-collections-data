This print is characteristic of Opie's work from the late 1990s onwards. The deceptively simple imagery is in fact a sophisticated synthesis of visual sources, ranging from computer games and children's book illustrations to advertisements and films. It also reflects his own experience of a road trip he made across Europe in 1993, and the photographs he took along the way. Indeed this version of the subject has the narrow oblong format of a view framed by a windscreen. It also suggests a cinema screen, and by association, the evocative appeal of the road movie as a fantasy of escape and renewal, of driving to a new and better life.",
