            "public_access_description": "The 'Temperantia' Basin is one of the highlights of the V&A's pewter collection. It is a fine example of Edelzinn, literally \u2018precious pewter\u2019, which was produced in France and Germany during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. \n\nThe dish was probably made to decorate the buffet of a prince or of a civic body such as a town guild. Contemporary illustrations show these buffets could be enormous, multi-tiered structures supporting rich displays of gold, silver, mounted exotic shells and colourful stones, and other items from their owners' treasuries. \n\nBy the late 16th century, most fashionable patrons favoured fantastical Mannerist pieces for their displays. Mannerism was a courtly style based around the idea of difficult\u00e0: complex design, virtuoso craftsmanship and decoration infused with intellectual references. The surface of this dish is decorated with cast designs in relief with its central plaque depicting a figure of Temperance holding a wine-cup and ewer. Around the central boss a broad band of ornament contains four plaques with figures representing AER (air), AQUA (water), TERRA (earth), and IGNIS (fire). On the rim there are oval panels depicting the Seven Liberal Arts and their patron Minerva: GRAMMATIC (Grammar), DIALECTICA, RHETORICA (rhetoric), MUSICA (music), ARITHMETIQUA (Arithmetic), GEOMETRIA (Geometry) and ASTROLOGIA (Astrology). Between the plaques the dish is covered with finely cast strapwork, birds, masks, serpents, fruit, flowers and winged horses. As Edelzinn was designed for display it tends to survive in excellent condition.\n\nThe dish is signed \u2018FB\u2019 on the central boss for Francois Briot, the most celebrated member of a French family of medallists and die-cutters. Briot was a model carver, medallist and pattern-maker rather than a pewterer, creating copper moulds in which pewter was cast. The Temperantia dish, is his only known signed work. It would have been extremely costly to produce. The intricate modelling was highly skilled work. Briot's most likely patron was Friedrich I, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg (1557-1608), Count of Montb\u00e9liard (1581-93). Briot moved to Montbeliard in 1579 and by 1585 was appointed seal-engraver to the count and is known to have made medals for Friedrich.\n\nBriot's 'Temperantia' and similar 'Mars' basins have had a widespread influence. The V&A owns an almost identical dish by the early 17th-century Nuremberg modeller, Caspar Enderlein (Mus. No. 5477-1859). The Enderlein versions were not cast from an original but were made from moulds cut as line-for-line copies of the Briot dish. The model was further disseminated by polychrome pottery versions in Palissyware, of which the V&A has an example (Mus. No. C.2316-1910), and this in turn was copied in the 19th century (Mus. No. 1080-1871). Every year the winner of the women\u2019s singles at the Wimbledon Tennis Championships holds a 19th-century Elkington and Company electrotype copy of  Briot's very 'Mars' dish in The Louvre.",

            "history_note": "The 'Temperantia' Basin was one of the Museum's early purchases. Its provenance until the 19th century is not known. It was bought by the Museum from the Bernal Collection in 1855. This was an enormous collection of metalwork, glass, ceramics and miniatures belonging to Ralph Bernal, a lawyer and MP. The sale by Christie, Manson and Woods took 32 days during which 4294 lots fetched nearly \u00a371,000. The Museum bought 730 lots including this basin for which it paid \u00a319.\n\nThis basin be seen as one of those objects which heralded a change in direction in the Museum's collecting activities after the appointment of John Charles Robinson as Curator in 1853. Robinson was a prolific collector and persuaded the Museum's first director, Henry Cole, that historic works of art were as instructive to students as 'modern manufactures'. Under Robinson's guidance, some of the earliest purchases by the Museum included outstanding examples of European pewter.\n\nManchester Art Treasures Exhibition RF.2006/806\n\nHistorical significance: The 'Temperantia' Basin is one of the highlights of the V&A's pewter collection. It is a fine example of <i>Edelzinn</i>, literally \u2018precious pewter\u2019, which was produced in France and Germany during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. Made for display, Edelzinn incorporates intricate relief panels partly designed to emulate embossed silver. An important difference between silver and pewter, however, is that pewter is cast and as such depends on the production of expensive moulds, which in turn means that it was generally produced in multiples rather than as unique pieces. As a result, a number of \u2018Temperantia\u2019 dishes survive and the model, together with the similar 'Mars' dish has long been recognised as one of the great masterpieces of mannerist metalwork. As edelzinn was designed for display it tends to survive in excellent condition.\n\nThe dish is signed \u2018FB\u2019 on the central boss for Francois Briot, the most celebrated member of a French family of medallists and die-cutters. Briot was court engraver to John Frederick of W\u00fcrtemberg from 1586. He has subsequently been described as \"the Raphael or Cellini of pewterers\".  He was in fact a model carver, medallist and pattern-maker rather than a pewterer, creating copper moulds in which pewter was cast. It is for these dishes and for similar ewers, of which there is also one in the V&A\u2019s collection (Mus. No. 4289-1857), that Briot is best known.\n\nBorn in Damblain in Lorraine, Briot was well known during his lifetime as a modeller although the Temperantia dish, is his only known signed work. It would have been extremely costly to produce as the intricate modelling was highly skilled work. Briot's most likely patron is Friedrich I, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg (1557-1608), Count of Montb\u00e9liard (1581-93). Briot moved to Montbeliard in 1579 and by 1580 become a member of the smiths\u2019 guild. In 1585 he was appointed seal-engraver to the count and is known to have made medals for Friedrich.\n\nBriot's Mars and Temperantia dishes are usually dated to around 1585, although it is possible that they were made after Friedrich had moved to Stuttgart in 1593. They certainly date before 1601 when Briot\u2019s moulds for a dish, ewer, vases and a salt were seized for unpaid debts. The duke himself was named in the case as one of Briot\u2019s creditors.\n\nThe source of Briot\u2019s ornament has not been found and it has been suggested that the dish is an amalgamation of designs circulating around Europe from the middle of the 16th century. Designs by Etienne Delaune and Dirk Barendsz have been identified as sources for the Mars dish.\n\nBriot was apparently active as an alchemist at Friedrich\u2019s court in Stuttgart. The subjects of the Temperantia dish, especially the four elements, were central to alchemical speculations\n\nBriot's Temperantia and Mars basins have had a widespread influence. The V&A owns an almost identical dish by the early 17th-century Nuremberg modeller, Caspar Enderlein (Mus. No. 5477-1859). The Enderlein versions were not cast from an original but were made from moulds cut as line-for-line copies of the Briot dish. The model was further disseminated by polychrome pottery versions in Palissyware, of which the V&A has an example (Mus. No. C.2316-1910), and this in turn was copied in the 19th century (Mus. No. 1080-1871). Every year the winner of the women\u2019s singles at the Wimbledon Tennis Championships holds a 19th-century Elkington and Company electrotype copy of  Briot's 'Temperantia' dish in The Louvre.",

            "production_note": "Fran\u00e7ois Briot designed the model and made the mould from which this dish was cast. The signature FB on the central boss of the dish was signed in the mould before casting.\n\nThe pewterer who cast the dish is not known.  The pewterer did not strike a 'touch mark' on the finished dish.", 
            "historical_context_note": "The dish was probably designed to decorate the buffet of a prince or of a civic body such as a town guild. Contemporary illustrations show that buffets could be enormous, multi-tiered structures supporting rich displays of gold, silver, mounted exotic shells and colourful stones, and other items from their treasuries. \n\nBy the late 16th century, most fashionable patrons favoured fantastical Mannerist pieces for their displays. Mannerism was a courtly style based around the idea of <i>difficult\u00e0</i>: complex design, virtuoso craftsmanship and decoration infused with intellectual references. The surface of this dish is decorated with cast designs in relief with its central plaque depicting a figure of Temperance holding a wine-cup and ewer. Around the central boss a broad band of ornament contains four plaques with figures representing AER (air), AQUA (water), TERRA (earth), and IGNIS (fire). On the rim there are oval panels depicting the Seven Liberal Arts and their patron Minerva: GRAMMATIC (Grammar), DIALECTICA, RHETORICA (rhetoric), MUSICA (music), ARITHMETIQUA (Arithmetic), GEOMETRIA (Geometry) and ASTROLOGIA (Astrology). Between the plaques the dish is covered with finely cast strapwork, birds, masks, serpents, fruit, flowers and winged horses. The style was best suited to objects intended for display rather than for use.",
