This recent creation resembles quite closely the locket which the miniature had when it was in the Pierpont Morgan Collection (see below). \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> Notionally (but see below) in the possession of the Earls of Shaftesbury at St Giles near Cranborne, Dorset; sold to Samuel Addington c.1860, and by him to J Heywood Hawkins c.1865; C HT Hawkins, his sale, Christie's 10-17 May 1904,lot 916 (as Duke of Monmouth 'in the manner of Cooper but signed P.c.') , bt Gall, 71 gns, and sold to J Pierpont Morgan. Certainly at his sale, Christie's 24 June 1935,lot 25 (the entry copied from Williamson 1906-8), bt Spink, 735 gns, on behalf of Queen Mary who gave it to George V for the Royal Collection at Windsor; sold 1968 by private treaty with the Museum. \n\n<b>Exhibited:</b> Understood to be South Kensington 1865, no. 1974 (as Duke of Monmouth, with no attribution); RA 1938, no. 81b; RA 1960-1, no. 649; Tokyo 1975, no. 78 (repro. in colour); NPG 1974, no. 126, repro., and intro., p. xiii; New Haven etc. 1981-2, no. 49. \n\n<b>Literature:</b> Williamson 1906-8, vol.I, pp. 93-4, no. 102, pl, xlvi (2) and col. pl. 23 (where the 'original' silver-gilt locket is visible); Williamson 1907, pp. 7-8, repro. no. xxix; Foster 1914-16, vol. n, p. 54, no. 337 and p. 165;Williamson 1921, p. 71, pl, XI (2) (repro. in reverse); Foskett 1974, p. 127, pl. 32; <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 10; Murdoch 1981, p. 111, pl. 23a. \n\nThe problems with this miniature centre on its provenance, which has received little attention owing partly to the confidentiality surrounding its acquisition by the Museum. Since Mrs Foskett has published 1 the immediate source, it is possible to discuss the whole history openly.\n\nThe miniature was acquired by Queen Mary in the belief that it contributed to the royal iconography, and it was sold after Oliver Millar had correctly pointed out that the sitter was not Monmouth. According to the provenance given at Christie's in 1904 and in Williamson's Pierpont Morgan catalogue (1906-8), this identification had arisen only in the late nineteenth century, and was insupportable in the light of other certain images of the Duke. Proceeding, however, on the basis of the same Christie/Williamson provenance which gave an ultimate source in the Shaftesbury heirlooms, Oliver Millar suggested in correspondence with Graham Reynolds that a more plausible sitter would be Anthony Ashley Cooper, who became 2nd Earl of Shaftesbury in January 1682/3. This suggestion was adopted by the Museum and has never been questioned. \n\nThe iconographic evidence is inconclusive. The only other extant portrait of Lord Ashley (as he was styled from 1672) seems to be the Lely (2) This is tentatively dated by Collins Baker to 1677, but by Beckett to 1670.The latter, on the grounds of the sitter's apparent age, seems more likely, and this date places the Lely and the Cooper reasonably close in time. Their resemblance to one another is in fact by no means unmistakable, but, on a kindly construction, there is correspondence in the rather marked cleft chin, pouting lower lip, and in the long, unevenly ridged nose. In the Cooper, the sitter wears his own hair helped out with a periwig: in the Lely he wears a wig. \n\nDocumentary sources on Lord Ashley's appearance are similarly inconclusive.  Dryden's famous phrase 'born a shapeless lump, like Anarchy', (3) if it refers to its subject's physical rather than his intellectual and political heredity, would fit neither the Cooper nor the Lely, but Collins records that 'his external form is said to have been remarkably handsome'.(4) And, with this reputation, confusion of his image with that of Monmouth, Dryden's Absalom, may be understandable. If Lord Ashley had (at least in the nineteenth century) the reputation of a handsome figure, it would help to explain how an image of him could have become identified as the legendarily handsome Monmouth; so also would the close relationship of political interest between the Duke and Ashley's father, the 1st Lord Shaftesbury (Dryden's Achitophel) help to explain the early provenance. \n\nThe question, however, comes back to the reliability of the provenance. The only material factor supporting the identification is the link with the Shaftesbury family, and this must be regarded as deeply uncertain. The Christie catalogue of 1904 gives the first reference to Shaftesbury and Addington. Addington certainly acquired a number of miniatures from the then Earl of Shaftesbury, (5) and CHT Hawkins or perhaps J Heywood Hawkins probably acquired the miniature directly from him. This must have been about 1860, that is before Addington lent miniatures (but not this one) to South Kensington in 1862 (to which exhibition Heywood Hawkins did not lend) and before Hawkins lent his collection to South Kensington for the 1865 show. To the latter Hawkins sent an unattributed portrait of the Duke of Monmouth, and this, on the Christie's provenance, should be the first public showing of this miniature as then identified. \n\nBy 1904, if the Christie's cataloguer was not mistaken, the portrait was still Duke of Monmouth but a PC signature had now been discovered. This must raise serious doubts either as to the cataloguer's accuracy or as to whether the portrait was the same as Gall subsequently sold to Pierpont Morgan. At least one other instance of Morgan buying in good faith a miniature of falsified provenance is known.\" No previous cataloguer had noticed a <i>PC</i> signature on this Duke of Monmouth miniature, and Williamson, who must have seen the portrait in the sale or in the trade before Morgan bought it, does not mention its existence. There is now no mark or other indication that a signature has been removed, and, in any case, on the evidence of the present work, it seems impossible that it could ever have genuinely borne such a signature. The Peter Cross monogram covers work, especially in its early phase, of sometimes bewildering virtuosity, but, as in the Robert Km (Cross, Cat. No. 164), Cross always works in a stipple technique. On the other hand, the miniature has a clear place in Cooper's oeuvre, relating iconographically and stylistically to the <i>Duke of Monmouth</i> of 1667, (7) <i>La Belle Stuart</i> of probably 1666-7,(8) Duke of Lauderdale, 1664, (9) Unknown Man, 1667, (10) the undated <i>Unknown Man</i> at Welbeck Abbey; (11) and Charles Stuart, 3rd Duke of Richmond, (12) all of which are signed. The authorities on Cooper, from the fallible Williamson and the allinclusive Foster to Reynolds and Millar, have had no doubts about the attribution. Presumably, therefore, the 1904 Christie's catalogue, at least as it applies to this miniature, is unreliable and cannot be used to underpin the identification of the sitter as Lord Ashley. \n\nWilliamson's information is no better; it either repeats that of the 1904 cataloguer or is tainted in other ways. He had, as early as 1907, taken the opportunity in his Connoisseur article to embroider the provenance with a story that the miniature had been given by Monmouth to the 3rd Earl of Shaftsbury 'when they were together in Paris'. (13) Williamson, who was Pierpont Morgan's expert advisor, took great pleasure in circumstantial anecdotes and shared his client's preference for the glamour of grand names. He would have been reluctant to abandon the Monmouth identification, but I doubt whether he would have been a party to the fraudulent removal of a signature, and he would not have been able to resist exposing the folly of the 1904 cataloguer had the latter simply made a mistake. \n\nFoster's evidence confirms that, even to the connoisseurs of c.1904-14, the question was as confused as it seems now. In his <i>Alphabetical List</i>(14) he includes this miniature first as by PC (15) but omits it from the resume of Christie's sales under the Carandini/Cleyn heading, (16) then includes it (as Signed '<i>PC</i> but in the manner of <i>SC</i>') in the resume of Cooper sales at Christie's,(17) and lastly includes it again with no reference to the <i>PC</i> signature, (as 'now in the Pierpont Morgan Collection') in his main list for Cooper. Foster was writing simply and disinterestedly from the Christie's catalogue, and his entries that derive from this source therefore do not give independent corroboration of the catalogue's accuracy. The only independent testimony that he offers is the statement (18) that there was nothing at South Kensington in 1865 which bore the <i>PC</i> signature. \n\n1 Foskett NPG 1974. \n2 Collins Baker, vol. 11, 129, no. 172; Beckett 1951, no. 479; engraved in mezzotint, probably by R Tompson.\n3 <i>Absalom and Achitophel</i>, I, line 172. \n4 <i>Peerage of England</i> (1709), ed.
