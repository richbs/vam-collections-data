The edges are marked by a narrow stripe of dark purple and a wider outer stripe of red, also in satin, from which the weft threads bound by the cream ground warp project and double back to form a firm selvedge. The ends are bound by a matching ribbon with the pattern warps of red and dark purple silk forming vertical bands of colour on the firmly woven part, while the weft threads float loose at the lower end to form a silky fringe 2.5 inches long in cream-white with a dyed horizontal band of pink across the centre.\n\nThe decoration is painted and in the neo-classical style. At each end is a medallion containing a small scene in ochre and cream on a grey ground. The composition of these scenes varies though each contains the same element, namely two women, one playing on a pipe and one attending to doves, and a small boy or cupid before a shrine or a tomb. The medallions are surrounded by symmetrical arabesque ornament of the Raphaelesque type, with scrolls, vines, cornucopias, ram's skull, snake and female figure beneath a baldaquin.\n\nIn the middle of the sash is an oblong scene (14 inches x 3.5 inches) with a dark painted background to throw the figure into relief. The scene shows a sacrifice in a classical temple, indicated by four columns before the statue of a god. A priest pour a libation, a man bearing an axe brings a goat to be slaughtered, and women and children carry offerings and garlands.",
