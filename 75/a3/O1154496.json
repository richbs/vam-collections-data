The costume consists of a tight short sleeve scarlet bodice with a low scooped neckline and soft, wide skirt in shade of grey and white. The folds and texture of the skirt are conveyed through bold brushstrokes, the grey strokes finishing in rough scallops to leave a white border at the hem, whilst the bodice top is painted in a smooth red. The figure wears a small grey bow in her hair wears a diamond shaped grey sash round her waist fastening in a large bow.\n\nSophie Fedorovitch (1893-1953) was born in Russia and came to Britain in 1920 where she became one of the most significant and influential designers for the ballet. She had trained as a painter but from 1932 onwards concentrated on designing for the stage. Fedorovitch created 11 ballets for Frederick Ashton, who regarded her as the ideal designer for dance. She liked to work closely with choreographers, attending rehearsals and developing her ideas as the ballet took shape. On paper her designs appear impressionistic, usually no more than a few brush strokes, but capture the mood and the essentials; the practical details came later and could be worked out with the costumier. It is a way of working that many costume makers prefer, allowing them to contribute their own ideas so that the finished costume becomes the result of a collaborative process. \n\nIn 1940 Fedorovitch designed Andr\u00e9e Howard's one-act ballet La F\u00eate \u00c9trange, a haunting dream-like piece based on Alain-Fournier's novel Les Grandes Meaulnes.  By chance a boy comes to a mysterious chateau where a betrothal party is taking place. The boy is captivated by the beautiful bride-to-be and his innocent love causes the estrangement of the girl and her fianc\u00e9.",
