Studied at Sass's art school 1834, and entered the RA Schools 1835; joined the sketching society known as The Clique 1837. Exhibited 28 paintings at the RA between 1838 and 1860, nine at the Bl 1838-47, and also at the SBA from 1837 to 1842. His subjects were taken from literature, particularly Shakespeare, and later, influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites with whom he was closely associated, scenes from everyday modem life, sometimes with a moral theme. Elected ARA 1848, RA 1860. For reasons of bad health, he travelled to Algiers, but died there 26 March 1863. His studio sale was at Christie's 18 May 1863. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Union</i> 1847, p312; <i>Art Journal</i> 1863, p87 (obit); <i>Athenaeum</i> 11 April 1863, pp491-2 (obit) \n\n<b>A Girl with Clasped Hands</b> \n8465-1863 Neg FH1075 \nCanvas, 35.5 x 30.5 cm (14 x 12 ins) \nPurchased 1863 \n\nPresumably a study for a larger composition, which has not been identified, although possibly 'Contemplation' (Forbes Magazine collection). \n\nPROV: The artist's sale, Christie's 18 May 1863 (73, 'A Girl with her Hands Clasped'), bought Burchett (presumably Richard Burchett, for the museum) \u00a311 15s\"",
