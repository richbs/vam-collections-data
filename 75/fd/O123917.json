Watteau then reached Paris, probably around 1702 and may have met Claude Gillot (1673-1722) two or three years later and collaborated with him some years. Watteau was best known for his invention of the 'f\u00eate galante', which was exploited by many followers after his early death in 1721. \n\nThis painting was probably made by a follower of the French painter Antoine Watteau in the 18th century. It reproduces Watteau's most famous formula of the 'f\u00eate galantes', a genre that he created in the 1710s. It depicts elegant figures in a wooded landscape, which conveys a sense of mystery. Watteau had many followers in France and in England in the first half of the 18th century.",

            "history_note": "Historical significance: This painting is very close to the type of 'f\u00eate galante' Watteau developed between 1714 and 1718. \nIt depicts elegant figures in a landscape with a village in the right background. In the central foreground, a young man is holding a white handkerchief to a lady dressed in white. The poor conditions of the work, whose surface has darkened under the effect of the varnish, make its attribution difficult to assert. \nHowever it seems to imitate some of Watteau's scenes, which look quite dark and convey a sense of mystery. The painting was doubtless made by a close follower who probably drew on such paintings as <i>The Perspective</i> in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, which display a similar arrangement of figures bathed in shade with shimmering dresses and, characteristically, a standing lady seen from the back, which is a recurrent Watteau's formula. \nWatteau enjoyed a great success during his life and his works continued to be sought-after by collectors after his death, especially in England. Philippe Mercier, a Huguenot painter working in London from ca. 1716 to 1736, borrowed elements of his style while his art also influenced some artists such as William Hogarth (1697-1764).",

            "historical_context_note": "Pastoral is a genre of painting whose subject is the idealized life of shepherds and shepherdesses set in an ideally beautiful and idyllic landscape. These scenes are reminiscent of the Arcadia, the Antique Golden Age that the Roman author Virgil (1St BC) described in the <i>Eclogues</i> and were at the time illustrated on the Roman wall paintings. The pastoral was reborn during the Renaissance, especially in Venice, in the oeuvre of such painters as Titian (ca. 1488-1576) and Giorgione (1477-1510), and gradually evolved over the centuries. In the 17th century, Arcadian themes were illustrated in the Roman school led by the painter Claude Lorrain (1604-1682) whereas a century later, Antoine Watteau (1684-1721) and his followers forged the new genre of <i>f\u00eates galantes</i>, which appears as a derivation of the pastoral. The pastoral became the hallmark of the Rococo movement in which Fran\u00e7ois Boucher's (1703-1770) elegant eroticism found his true expression. This tradition, which had become an illustration of the carefree aristocratic world, died with the French revolution and was never revived although the celebration of the timeless Mediterranean world in the oeuvre of such painter as Henri Matisse (1869-1954) may be seen as a continuing interest for the theme.",
