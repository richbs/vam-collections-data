They are usually in the shape of a narrow band, like this. Some have loops at the ends, suggesting they were meant to be fastened around something. It seems most likely that they were worn around the wrist, as a bracelet.\n\nA reference in John Donne's early 17th century poem The Relique, suggests that bracelets worked in hair were given and worn as love tokens:\n\nWhen my grave is broke up againe\nSome second ghest to entertaine ...\nAnd he that digs it, spies\nA bracelet of bright haire about the bone,\nWill he not let us alone\nAnd thinke that there a loving couple lies...\n\n[the poem continues]\nWho thought that this device might be some way\nto make their soules, at the last busie day,\nmeet at this grave, and make a little stay ?..",
