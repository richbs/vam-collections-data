Situated by the River Jumna at Agra, this mausoleum was commissioned by Shah Jahan to enshrine the body of his favourite wife, Arjumand Banu Begum, better known as Mumtaz Mahal ('Elect of the Palace'), who died shortly after giving birth to her fourteenth child in 1631. Construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1632 with a workforce of 20,000 men, and was completed in 1653. \n\n'Company paintings' were produced by Indian artists for Europeans living and working in the Indian subcontinent, especially British employees of the East India Company. They represent a fusion of traditional Indian artistic styles with conventions and technical features borrowed from western art. Some Company paintings were specially commissioned, while others were virtually mass-produced and could be purchased in bazaars.",
