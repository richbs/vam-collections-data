The skirt is cartridge pleated to the waist, and the front has a full length wedge-shaped area of Ayrshire embroidery to match that on the bodice front.  The garment fastens at the back.\n\nThe robings run from the back of the neck to the waist front: this may suggest the combining of a bodice and skirt from two different garments, but the embroidery on both matches.",

They were skillfully mended where necessary, and many show beautifully worked darns.  This gown has been mended on the bodice, and the area round the waist has been reinforced and then covered with a carefully applied band of white embroidery.
