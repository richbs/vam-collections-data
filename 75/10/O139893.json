Movin' Out tells the story of a generation of American youth growing up on Long Island, New York, during the 1960s and their experiences with the Vietnam War. The principal characters are drawn from those who appeared in various Billy Joel songs. On Broadway Movin' Out had a run of 1331 performances, but ticket sales in London were disappointing and the production only ran for 16 weeks.  \n\nThis production was one of many in recent years to use already famous pop songs by an individual band or performer, such as Mamma Mia, written around the songs of Abba, and We Will Rock You which uses the songs of Queen. Movin' Out was also promoted as a musical;  the involvement of the contemporary choreographer Twyla Tharp, however, meant that it was actually a dance performance set to the songs of Billy Joel. The vocals were performed by a pianist and band suspended above the stage, whilst the performers acted out the narrative through contemporary dance.",
