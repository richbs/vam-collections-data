Note: lower right 92\" (24 cm) vertical line of warp reduction of approximately 3/4\" (2 cm) in width; although this has been backed, it may not have been damaged but rather worn from where warp threads have been added.\nSIDE FINISH: one cord overcast with white cotton.\nEND FINISH: incomplete but both ends have 2\" (1 cm) plain weave with white cotton and then a fringe: lower 3\" (7.5 cm).  Upper: 2\" (5.5 cm) of 4 threads tied to form a lattice with at least 3 bands of offset knots.\nDESIGN: field: red ground with a narrow, angular light blue and yellow lattice forming a small diamond with dark brown cross at the centre and framing 10 and two half bands of five blue stepped diamonds, extending top and bottom into arrowheads, outlined in white and containing a variety of floral sprigs with some rosettes and florets towards the lower end.\nMain border: dark green ground with white rosettes, each with checkerboard diamond centre, mostly in ground colour or blue and yellow and each lying between white pseudo-Kufic brackets which on both long sides bear an S-motif in the hooked triangular terminals.  On the upper and lower border this is reduced to a small triangle.\nInner and outer borders: dark brown ground with a line of stepped flowers in all other colours divided by intrusive triangles in light blue or dark brown.\nInnermost and outermost borders: light blue ground with \"twisted ribbon\" zigzag pattern in red and either white or yellow.\nCatalogue Date: 4.4.95",
