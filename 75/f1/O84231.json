According to tradition, this ceremonial armour was presented by the duke to the Spanish emperor, Charles V. \n\nOn the exterior, a decoration of vine-leaf tendrils is damascened in gold and silver \u2013 a technique named after metalworkers in Damascus, Syria, who developed this method of decorating metalwork with gold and silver wire. This differs markedly from the interior decoration, which is in an Islamic style with arabesques and half-palmettes. It is possible that the stirrups were decorated by two goldsmiths working in collaboration. This might explain the discrepancy between the initials B.C.F. (Bartolommeo Campi Fecit) on the armour and A.C.F. on the stirrups.\n\nFrom the 16th century, arms and armour were included in antiquarian and aristocratic collections to evoke associations of a medieval chivalric past. In precisely such a collection in the early 19th century, these elaborately decorated stirrups were esteemed by former owner, George Salting, as examples of goldsmiths\u2019 work and were accordingly placed alongside bronzes and porcelains in his collection.",
