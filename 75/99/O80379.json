The house was built between 1722 and 1735, and the State Apartment was furnished by about 1732. The seat furniture is carved naturalistically with lion's masks and legs, and gilded on a ground made gritty with sand. The covers are of green velvet, to match the State Bed designed by William Kent. \n\nAlthough this set of chairs is very different in style from the suite in the Second State Apartment at Houghton (V&A Museum nos W.1-22-2002), it may be by the same maker, possibly Thomas Roberts junior, who is known to have worked for Walpole. The same rather distinctive striped ticking is used for the upholstery foundation.\n\nOn loan to Houghton Hall.",

The burr-walnut and gilt suite has been attributed to Thomas Roberts junior, on the strength of his single surviving bill to Robert Walpole of c. 1729, which mainly relates to furniture supplied for Walpole's London houses (but which includes the supply of caffoy for the Saloon at Houghton). The difference in style is probably explicable in terms of the burr-walnut and gilt suite being made to suit the pre-existing embroidered bed; and in the present state of knowledge it seems reasonable to suppose that both suites were manufactured and upholstered entirely in one workshop, most likely that of Thomas Roberts junior.",
