By the date of this miniature, the leading miniature painters rarely painted small, jewel-like mementoes.  Instead, they painted larger works that were often framed like this one with a prop at the back allowing it to stand on a desk.\n\nHistorical Associations\nIn 1839, a year before this miniature was painted, members of the nobility held a Medieval-style tournament at Eglinton Park, Ayrshire.  With jousting contests and pageants, the organisers hoped to recreate every detail of the age of chivalry.  Unfortunately, after so much time spent procuring props, perfecting costumes and erecting banqueting tents, torrential rain ruined the occasion. With knights on horseback reduced to cowering under umbrellas, the original Eglinton Tournament had to be postponed until a later date.\n\nPeople\nThe Marquis of Waterford was considered one of the most handsome men of his day. In 1841 he married Louisa Stuart, the second daughter of Sir Charles and Lady Stuart.  Both Louisa and her sister, Lady Charlotte Canning, were prolific amateur artists whose work is represented in the V&A.",
