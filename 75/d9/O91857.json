They met the demands of a beer-drinking population grown prosperous through trade. They were often presented as gifts at births, christenings and weddings. Due to the busy trade routes between the countries around the Baltic and North seas, designs for tankards in Scandinavia, north Germany and England were often similar in the 16th and 17th centuries. This tankard is imaginatively embossed (hammered into relief) with fantastical sea creatures and dolphins, as well as botanical ornament popular throughout Europe in the 1660s. The tankard bears an English inscription dated 1856, recording that it was a christening gift from the Duke of Hamilton to Allen Douglas MacDonald.",
