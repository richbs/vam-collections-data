            "bibliography": "Alistair Rowan, 'Robert Adam: Catalogue of Drawings in the Victoria and Albert Museum', V&A publications, 1988, cat. 69 and illustrated in plate 27\nIn 1778 Adam made designs for a lodge and gates at Hyde Park Corner.  The scheme recorded here which is infinitely more ambitious and which bears the fateful inscription 'put aside' presumably pre-dates the 1778 project.  When these grandiose proposals were drawn up is not known.  Drawings in the Soane Museum record three different schemes for the gateway each of which envisages a deep courtyard on the east, or town side, of the archway with colonnaded or arcaded screens flanking side gates leading to Hyde Park and Constitution Hill.  Of these designs the largest accords with the silhouette of the present elevation though the architecture is of the Corinthian Order with coupled columns rising the full height of the main arch block.  This Doric scheme is evidently a variant of the largest design.  Part of the layout plan in the Soane Museum matches this plan exactly and established that Adam intended to place a weigh house in the northern archway and accommodation for the toll gatekeper in the arch to the south, with pedestrian passage ways at either end.  A curiosity of this elaborately architectural fa\u00e7ade is that it would have been wider than the colonnaded blocks that framed the approach to it which overlap the outermost bays of the design by four feet.  The layout plan which records the irregular huddle of small properties near St George's Hospital, which Adam's scheme would have replaced, does not suggest that any constraints inherent in the site dictated this overlapping of the different parts.  On the contrary this must have been a conscious decision of the architetect's to enhance the sense of movement and picturesque effect within the composition. It seems possible that Lord Apsley, Lord Chancellor from January 1771 to June 1778,  and for whom Adam was working at Apsley House immediately adjacent to the Hyde Park corner site, may have been instrumental in securing this public commission.  Apsley succeeded his father as 2nd Earl Bathurst in September 1775 and, as his property is marked on the layout plan as Lord Bathurst's, the Gateway scheme must be dated to that year or later.\n\nThis heroic proposal for Hyde Park Corner demonstrates Adam's ability in formal architecture at its very best.  A design of grandeur and authority, it is marked with much of the distinctive personality of the architect, as apparent in the strictly organised proportional scheme of the entire fa\u00e7ade as in its free and imaginative use of detail.  In this triumphal entrance Adam builds up a system of inter-related arch openings and entablatures as dense and uncompromising as that of any sixteenth century Italian architect: thus the pedestrian entry arches at either end of the screen are related to the relieving arches that flank the central block by the scale of entablature of the aedicule which contains them. This entablature becomes, in the next bay of the design, the impost from which the relieving arch springs and this arch is itself contained within an area that is defined and limited by a second entablature tied by a keystone to the top of the arch.  In the central block of the composition this second entablature (defined by the height of the arch beneath it) becomes the impost of the triumphal arch itself which rises to a third and final entablature to which it too is linked by a scrolled keystone.  Thus the whole design builds up logically from the scale of the outermost pedestrian arches to the climax of the central opening and this climax is sustained in the increasing width of the units of the fa\u00e7ade, read from the outer edges towards the centre as 15ft., 17ft., 15ft., and 22 ft., or, if the whole centre block is taken as one unit, as 15ft., 17ft., and 42ft. In terms of formal analysis by bays the fa\u00e7ade can thus be described as a rhythmic progression of a-b-c-b-a (when the central section is considered as a distinctive whole) or as a-b-ai-d-ai-b-a where the central section is broken down into its constituent elements of piers with aedicule niches that balance the outermost pedestrian arches (ai) and the great central arch itself (d).  Proportional relationships evident in this design are (i) the square used in the central block (c) with the centre of the arc of the arch placed fractionally above the intersection of its diagonals - a deviation from absolute geomery which Adam will have adopted as a visual adjustment occasioned by the entra height of the apex of the pediment - and (ii) the occurrence of golden-section rectangles in the central arch piers (ai) and the outermost bays (a) where the proportion of the height (taken as the base of the underside of the cornice) to the width is  that of 1.618 to 1 or  'phi'.  The occurrence of this proportional relationship has been analysed by Professor David Fensom (1984) as an essential ingredient in the development of Adam elevational schemes.  Golden section or phi rectangles in British eighteenth-century architecture are also discussed in Robertson (1948).  Details which are characteristic of Adam's approach to design are the non-antique fluted entablature of the pediment interrupted, in true Neo-classical taste, by the slab-like, blank central tablet; the massively scaled guttae (almost a foot in diameter) beneath the tablet  and hinting at the doric order; and the frieze of the arch impost and screen wall entablature which is a common Adam invention alternating three vertical flutes and a patera as an unorthodox variation of a triglyph frieze.  Finally the delicate counter point of Adam's use of garlands between the base of the statue niches and the pedestals beneath the lion and the unicorn should be noted as unconscious memory of Michelangelo's Medici chapel tombs.",
