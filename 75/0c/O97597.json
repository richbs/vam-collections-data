It consists of a simple base and on the right of the box frame a yaksini stands front view under a tree, whose branches she is touching with her right hand. The main scene shows part of the Dipamkara  Jataka.  Slightly to the right of the centre, there stands the Buddha Dipamkara, turning to the left and bowing his head to the Bodhisattva Sumati, who is represented twice.  The Buddha is shown clutching the sanghati with his right hand, while his left is raised in abhayamudra.   The Bodhisattva at first appears standing with his right hand ready to throw lotus blossoms; next to him on the ground squats the other Bodhisattva spreading his hair in the path of the Buddha. A standing figure of a girl selling lotus flowers is shown with a large water urn.  A layman with a fly-whisk (cauri) stands on the right of the Dipamkara Buddha.",
