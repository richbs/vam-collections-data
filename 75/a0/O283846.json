The bowl, on the other hand, is not dissimilar in texture and coarseness of style to a steatite oval box, found in Nubia, and dating probably to the 7th or 8th century. This type of object might have been made at almost any time in a Christian community in the Near East, and it seems hardly likely the bowl is of much earlier than from the 7th or 8th century.",
