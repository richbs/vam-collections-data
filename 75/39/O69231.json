This consisted of painting a compound of silver on the back of the glass. After firing in a kiln, the silver compound would turn yellow. Many panels from the 14th and 15th centuries are decorated simply in yellow (silver) stain and highlighted with a brown-black pigment.\n \nThis fragment of decorated glass depicts a spray of stylised leafs picked out from a wash of brown pigment painted over the glass. The leaves are encased in a border of alternating squares of cross-hatching and 'X's stained yellow on the reverse and picked out from a dense coat of brown paint on the front. This fragment most likely was part of a tracery panel of glass which would have originally occupied the very top of a window in a church.\n\nThe religious conflicts that affected the British Isles in the 16th and 17th centuries had a devastating effect upon the decorative arts and furnishings of the Christian church. Much of the medieval stained glass in churches and cathedrals was damaged and only survives in a fragmentary state.",

Much of the stained glass in churches and cathedrals was damaged and only survives in a fragmentary state.\n\nThis fragment of decorated glass depicts a spray of stylised leafs picked out from a wash of brown pigment painted over the glass. The leaves are encased in a border of alternating squares of cross-hatching and 'X's stained yellow on the reverse and picked out from a dense coat of brown paint on the front. This fragment most likely was part of a tracery panel of glass which would have originally occupied the very top of a window in a church.\n\nIn contrast to traditional stained glass, which was coloured with metallic oxides when in a molten state, this fragment was decorated using a new technique introduced in England in the early 14th century. This consisted of painting a compound of silver on the back of the glass. After firing in a kiln, the silver compound turns yellow. Many panels from the 14th and 15th centuries are decorated simply in yellow (silver) stain and highlighted with a brown/black pigment.",
