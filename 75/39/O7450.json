Probably the painting isn't quite so good in the cathedral. I think subsequently the panel was shown at the All Hallows, London Wall....I'm glad it's going to be in a light-box though you may find with artificial light it would be the best thing to reverse the paint-side and put it back-to-front with the glassy side to the viewer - otherwise its apt to look drab and lacklustre when the light is not on.",
