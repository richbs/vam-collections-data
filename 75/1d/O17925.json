They depict a durbar (public reception) at the Murshidabad court, and various Hindu and Muslim festivals and religious scenes. A Murshidabad artist copied it, probably from an original oil painting by George Farington. He had worked in Murshidabad from May 1785 until his death there in 1788. Farington's original is lost, but someone who saw it remarked that the sepoys depicted in it 'appeared too tall', as they are in this copy.",

As William Hickey observed in his racy and scurrilous 'Memoirs', this post was 'considered as the most lucrative office in the Company's service, the whole stipend or salary allocated by Government to the Nawab passing through such Resident's hands, in which channel a considerable portion of it always stuck to his fingers.' It may have been at D'Oyly's suggestion that the historical painter George Farington, on whose lost work this picture is probably based, went to paint at Murshidabad. The Murshidabad artist has interpreted the subject very ably, although in his efforts to render recession the foreground figures have become over-elongated.\n\nPublished: M. Archer [1979] pl.77.",
