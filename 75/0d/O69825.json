They have come in and out of fashion in Europe and North America. Ponchos became popular in the USA during the 1940s, and the interest in ethnic dress in the 1960s sparked another revival. Ponchos were back in vogue in the autumn/winter collections for 2004/5.",

Babies are often given gifts of handmade garments. Elements such as the patchwork poncho and rainbow hat mirror the style of adult travellers.'",
