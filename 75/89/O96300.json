Although there can be no doubt that such figures were made in large numbers but they suffered more than stone sculptures. \nIt has been suggested that  English sculptors worked in Norway and Sweden in the thirteenth century since sculptures such as the Langham Virgin provided the model for a number of groups now preserved in Scandinavia. The importance of English wood sculpture of the first quarter of the thirteenth century for wood sculpture of this period in Lower Saxony has been recently postulated.",
