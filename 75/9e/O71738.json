            "physical_description": "The crowned saint appears in the centre of the panel looking through a window of the prison; she holds her hands raised apart in an attitude of prayer. The window is carved right through the panel. Two angels stand behind St. Catherine in the cell. Above the window is the figure of a dove holding a round wafer in its beak. On the left a crowned figure representing the empress kneels on the ground, her hands joined in prayer. She looks towards the saint, a scroll rising vertically from her hands. In front of her, at the bottom of the panel, kneels a male figure; he is dressed in a short, belted tunic, with a hood on his shoulder; his hands are also held together in prayer. He looks towards the saint and a scroll curves from his hands towards the window of the cell. On the right of the panel stands the Risen Christ with a halo. He is bearded and is shown wearing a torse, a loincloth and the shroud draped over his shoulders. He holds the cross-staff of the Resurrection in his left hand and gives a blessing with his right. The heads and wings of three angels are visible at the top of the panel and an angel stands in each of the top corners, holding a taper.\n\nThe arms and hands of the saint are damaged. Her face is badly worn. Part of Christ's staff is missing at the bottom. The top left-hand corner of the panel has been broken off. The heads of the two angels holding tapers at the top of the panel have been broken off. The face of the male figure is damaged. The top right corner of the panel has been restored with alabaster. 'Scrubbed'-looking darkened green paint remains at the bottom of the panel, with traces of the usual daisy pattern. There is red paint on the inside of Christ's shroud, on his halo, and the male figure's hood and on the angels' wings. The latter are decorated with white flecks in which are black dots. The back of the panel is incised with a number of small circles, three of which are patterned, one bearing the date '1791.' All appear to be of a later date than the panel. There are two original lead-plugged holes. The bottom has been cut away.",
