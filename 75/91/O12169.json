However, in the 1784 catalogue (p. 66) of Horace Walpole's collection at Strawberry Hill, his house at Twickenham, it is described as a 'tooth-pick case of gold, enamelled with cameos; a present from Lady Diana Beauclerc'.\n\nPeople\nLady Diana Beauclerk was an amateur painter of considerable talent and a close friend of Horace Walpole.  She was praised by Sir Joshua Reynolds, and she was the author of designs which were used in ceramics by Wedgwood.  In 1775, Beauclerk executed seven drawings illustrating Walpole's tragedy in blank verse, 'The Mysterious Mother', which pleased him so much that he built an octagonal room for them at Strawberry Hill, which he called the Beauclerk Closet. Walpole expressed his enthusiasm for enamelling in 1759 at the end of a commission for an enamelled watch which he arranged for Sir Horace Mann: 'if anything a quarter so pretty was found in Herculaneum we should admire their enamellers more than their Scipios and Caesars'.\n\nDesign & Designing\nFrom the late 1760s the taste for Neo-classical design favoured enamelling which imitated cameos.  The white heads or figures stand out from the chocolate ground.",
