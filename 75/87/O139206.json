When Calvert Jones photographed the building, it was occupied by  tradesmen: workers in metal and wood and a dealer in ship's stores. The open colonnade provided shelter only for seasoning timber and the deteriorating building would be demolished in 1949.",

The open colonnade provided shelter only for seasoning timber and the deteriorating building would be demolished in 1949.",
