The front of the trunk is decorated with a similar scrolling pattern, and is further enriched with angle-plates pierced with geometrical designs. They are engraved with a floral pattern with an etched decoration in between.\n\nThe trunk is heavily decorated with brass mounts with crowns on the hasps; they bear an engraved floral pattern with a etched decoration similar to that on the angle-plates. \n\nIn the centre is a large lock plate of scrolled outline and in the shape of two dragons\u2019 heads, also engraved with a floral pattern.\n\nThe drop-handles on each side of the trunk are set on circular plates with engraved foliate decoration.\n\n\n<b>Summary of later interventions/changes</b>\n\nA piece of leather is missing on the bottom left hand side of the base of the trunk and the bottom left hand corner at the back, revealing the softwood structure. \nThe end panels that extend on the sides are probably of a later date than the rest of the trunk as they do not appear on similar trunks of the period.",

The leather is nailed to the trunk, which was the traditional method of applying leather. It runs over the top of the lid and sides. The leather cannot be identified due to the  residues of surface treatments, but it may be bovine.\n\nThe bottom of the trunk is made of two wide planks. The interior timber consists of pine with the end panels extending on the sides, and straight at the front to fit the shape of the lid. They cover the whole length of the base of the trunk and the lid. The curved lid is made of angled planks. \n\nThe inside of the trunk is lined with fabric. It is nailed to the trunk on a pink ribbon along the corners / angles and along the upper edge of the base. The lid is also lined with fabric, a pink ribbon is nailed on the inside, forming a repeating diamond-shaped pattern. A white ribbon is sewed on the right hand side of the base to the right hand side of the lid. The internal sides of the lid and the vertically protruding external sides of the base of the trunk are lined with marbled paper. \n\nThe trunk bears a total of twenty four brass mounts and four angle plates. Those would have been made from a stock mould. The engraving on the brass mounts is of good quality and would have been more expensive than the mounts themselves. A significant amount of workmanship went into the mounts and the holes were pierced individually.The engraved decoration would have been quite common and could be found on locks. \n\nThe large escutcheon at the front of the trunk is fixed with three large screws and twelve smaller ones. The keyhole is covered with a hinged plate. The engraved decoration was probably executed by a different hand than that responsible for the engravings on the mounts and is of better quality. The escutcheon appears to be of a later date than the rest of the mounts, probably 20 or 30 years later. It could have been a later replacement, and may have been linked to a change of ownership of the chest. \n\nThere are two sizes of brass studs, each of approximately 4 mm and 8 mm diameter.\n\nThe back mounts have a protective function and prevent damage to the leather on the angles of the trunk.\n\nThe side handles would have been made from a stock mould. Similar handles could be found on wine coolers. \n\n\n",

The tradition of covering trunks with leather and decorating them with nails continued well until the nineteenth century when new methods of productions and materials brought to a close the coffer and trunk-maker\u2019s ancient handicraft.\n\nTrunks of a similar shape and decoration were made by Richard Pigge, coffer-maker to Charles II and William III, and later Edward Smith, trunk-maker to George II. In the seventeenth century, the term \u2018coffer\u2019 was gradually superseded by that of \u2018trunk\u2019, hence the change of appellation from coffer to trunk-maker.",

            "historical_context_note": "<b>Historical Context</b>\nUsed for the storage of clothes, money, arms, food and other personal property, trunks were indispensable pieces to households. They did not go out of fashion even when chests of drawers and other receptacles for storage became widely used. The most lavish trunks were intended to hold the gala dress of courtiers and ladies of fashion, or the valuable presents received by brides.\n\n<b>Historical Significance</b>\nThe function of an object often dictates its design and the choice of its material. The trunk\u2019s domed lid and its leather covering would have made it waterproof. The inclusion of tulips in the decorative scheme was a reflection of contemporary cultural practices: a sought-after luxury item and status symbol, the flower was a favourite decorative motif in the 17th century and could be found adorning a wide range of objects, ranging from ceramics to textiles.\n\nThis trunk appears to have been one of a pair, the other was part of the collections at Holland House, Kensington, and was destroyed during World War II. \n\nSeveral closely comparable trunks are known.\nA related leather trunk can be found at Hardwick Hall: although the gilt nails form a different scrolling pattern to the V&amp;A piece, it has identical lock plate and mounts. (examination of photographs would suggest that the engraved decoration on the mounts is different). The drop-handles on the side of the trunk are also identical, but the metal plates differ. \n\nA similar trunk was at Clandon Park (upstairs landing) in 1996.\n\nTwo other trunks with identical mounts and lock plates but different brass nail decorative patterns were offered for sale at  Hotspur Ltd (c1985?), and Mallet\u2019s (Feb. 1995). The Hotspur trunk was dated c. 1690 and attributed to Richard Pigge, Royal coffer-maker. The Mallet's trunk was dated c1670 and attributed to Richard Pigge 'coffer-maker to Charles II'. The lock plates of both trunks bear a similar engraved pattern to the V&amp;A object.",
