He was responsible for developing the painterly quality of micromosaics by increasing the geometric shapes and fused colours of the tesserae. In 1810 his work was shown in the Campidoglio at the Capitoline exhibition of 'Roman Works of Art and Industry'. From 1834 to 1846 he was professor of mosaics at the Vatican Mosaic Workshop and trained the renowned Michelangelo Barberi.",

This painting gained Caravaggio more recognition than any other of his works during his lifetime. In the seventeenth century the Vatican workshop started to create smaller versions of mosaic altarpieces in St Peter's for use as papal gifts or for sale to a select few.  The original large scale mosaic of the Entombment took ten years to make and was eventually placed in the Chapel of the Sacrament from 1829. In 1896 it was moved to the Sacristy. The mosaic version of this painting was used to establish the background colour of Caravaggio's original which had become too dark to read.",
