The set was probably used in a drawing room or parlour. The frame is veneered with a fine burr walnut on the back and the seat rails, and has shallow carving applied over the veneer. These pieces may have been made in the workshop of Henry Hill, who ran a very diverse business in Marlborough, Wiltshire, encompassing furniture making, coach making, house agency and auctioneering, among other activities. A nearly identical suite was formerly at Burderop House in Wiltshire, where Hill is known to have worked. Hill appears to have employed immigrant craftsmen in his workshop, which might account for the rather Dutch-looking features, particularly the carving.",

M. Calley, Humbert, Flint, Rawlence & Squarey, 20\u201322 May 1974, lot 882. The Calley family were major patrons of Henry Hill, at least in the 1770s, commissioning furniture for Burderop Park and Overtown House, also in Wiltshire. Although no Calley accounts have been found (so far) from before 1769, two points favour the attribution of these chairs to Hill: (a) the use of chestnut (or ash?) in their construction, which is suggestive of non-metropolitan practice; (b) the somewhat Dutch aspect of their carving, in view of the strong (though circumstantial) evidence that Hill employed immigrant craftsmen in his workshop (at least in the latter part of his career, from c. 1770).",
