Versions in various materials were produced subsequently by his casting workshop, established in Paris in 1873. The production of cast terracotta sculpture increased during the 18th century and by the time this object was produced it had reached an industrial scale. \n\nThe marketing of the female form in such small-scale multiple sculptures involved an implicit eroticism characteristic of much French sculpture of this period. These erotic qualities were apparently acceptable in works produced for private or gallery contexts but provoked controversy when presented in large-scale public sculpture.",
