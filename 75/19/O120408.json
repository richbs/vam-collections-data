It was made to commemorate the 100th performance of The Rollicking Girl by W.T. Francis, with music by Sydney Rosenfeld, which opened at the Herald Square Theatre on Broadway on 1 May 1905.  In the 19th century long runs of productions were often commemorated by the gift of special items, sometimes just for cast members, sometimes for those in the expensive seats and sometimes for the whole audience.\n\nThe musical was produced by Charles Frohman, the theatrical entrepreneur who had opened his own theatre, The Empire, in 1893, and who backed the first production of Peter Pan which opened in England, also in 1905. The composer William T. Francis had a large number of Broadway shows to his credit over a period of around ten years, none of which are well-known today. The Rollicking Girl ran for 192 performances till October 15 and enjoyed a short second run at the New York Theatre in April and May 1906.  Despite Francis & Rosenfeld's relatively large output, little can be found other than references to their collective works.",
