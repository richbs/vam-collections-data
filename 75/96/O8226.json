His illustrations to Alexander Pope's translation of Homer's Illiad, 1727, featured fighting eagles perched on a console table.   Such console tables remained fashionable till the 1740s and the fashion  for them was revived again in the early 19th and early 20th centuries. The earliest known illustration of  such a table appeared on the bill head of the Edinburgh maker Francis Brodie,1739. Such a design was particularly appropriate for a pier table - often made in pairs - which could be placed between the windows.  Such pairs usually had eagles facing in the opposite directions (see a pair sold Sotheby's New York 18 October 1997 lot 356)",
