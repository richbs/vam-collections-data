Noone discussed them or seemingly took an interest in them. We wore practical, cheap and comfortable clothes for active campaigning. We wore very little make up and eschewed conventional notions of young women in the 1950s through approroation of loose and comfortable men's clothing. It needs to be remembered that it did not take much then, either in dress or politicial terms, to create a public shock.\"\n\nPurchased. Registered File number 1994/1966.",
