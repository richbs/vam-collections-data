Designs (4), showing both sides of the mug, the handle and inside of the base. Drawn to a scale less than the dimensions of the mug as manufactured. On four sheets cut irregularly and affixed to a larger sheet to provide, with some variants, a detailed design for the entire mug. 1936\n\nSigned Eric Ravilious and inscribed <i>Mug to be black blue and yellow</i> and with other notes.\nPencil and watercolour. Size of sheet 30.7 x 48.2 cm\nGiven by the designer\nE.292-1937\n\nAfter attending art school in Eastbourne Ravilious attended the Design School of hte Royal College of Art, where he was strongly influenced by the teaching of Paul Nash. His contribution to design in Britain, although sadly short-lived, was substantial. He first worked on the design of lettering in relation to his illustrations for fine editions, most notably those for the Golden Cockerel Press and the Nonesuch Press, and also produced not only illustrations but items such as book-jackets and catalogue-covers for the Curwen Press. In 1935 he produced designs for  table-glass for Stuart Crystal Ltd and in 1936 designs for furniture for Duncan Hay Ltd, bu it was principally through his designs for the firm of Wedgwood that his work became best known to the public.\n\nHis association with Wedgwood's began in 1936 and proved to be a very fruitful partnership. the fine traditional shapes still used by the firm, the high quality of their ceramic bodies and their consistently high level of workmanship enabled Ravilious to use to the best advantage his unerring instinct for devising and placing decoration in perfect relationship to the shape of the piece to be decorated. His achievement was possibly the most outstanding of all among those established artists who were employed as designers by the pottery industry in the 1930s. Notable among these were Paul Nash, Vanessa Bell, Duncan Grant and Graham Sutherland who - with others - worked for the Fenton firm of E. Brain &amp; Co. His work was in no literal sense derivative from historicexemplars, but he was clearly deeply aware of the character and quality of early English hand-decorated and transfer-printed wares and was able to re-express in an entirely contemporary indiom a traditional commemorative theme using twentieth century technical resources to achieve his purpose.\n\nMuch of his design work for Wedgwood's achieves its effect through the subtle, varied and always appropriate use as ornament of lettering and numerals, as in this mug design. As may be seen he originally intended the mug to be executed in black, blue and yellow although he indicated the possibility of using pink as a ground and inside the base of the mug. He also showed alternatives for the decoration of the numerals and for the treatment of hte formalized firework busts.' \n<u>Victoria and Albert Museum, Department of Engraving, Illustration and Design and Department of Paintings, Accessions 1937</u>, London: Board of Education, 1938.\nThe full text of the record is as follows:\n\n<b>'RAVILIOUS, Eric.</b>\n\nDesign for a mug intended to commemorate the coronation of King Edward VIII. 4 drawings mounted on 1 sheet.\n<I>Signed </i>Eric Ravilious <i>and inscribed</i> Mug to be black blue and yellow<I> and with other notes.\nPencil and wash.\n</i>E.292-1937\nGiven by the Artist.'",
