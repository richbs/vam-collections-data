Full Citation: \n \n\"<b>57 William, Count of Nassau</b> \n(b.1592 d.1642) \n<b>1635-40</b> \nP35-1933  \n \n<b>Oval 52 x 41 mm (irregular)</b>  \n \nFeatures firmly and systematically hatched in brown and sanguine, with short wiry strokes, the lights in gouache and touches of white in the eyes, on a thick creamy carnation ground; hair in grey-brown wash, lined and heightened in opaque grey; collar in grey modelled in white; armour a dark grey opaque wash with the lights in white and the studs in yellow; background an opaque brown lightened with grey hatching lower right; on vellum put down on a leaf from a table-book, the whole then backed with a playing card (two diamonds). \n\n<b>Condition:</b> A little rubbed and engrimed at the sitter's temple; otherwise good.  \n \n<b>Signed:</b> Not Signed.  \n \n<b>Frame:</b> A silver-gilt oval locket; the convex back set into curved strip sides with a narrow groove just below the bezel, which holds the convex glass by its bevelled edge; the hanger of D-section, grooved down the middle, bifurcating into two diminishing spirals of four turns; made for the miniature in 1934 by F Jennings of Wardour Street.  \n \n<b>Provenance:</b> Sothebys 20 December 1933,lot 154 ('the property of a collector'), bt for the Museum with Cat. No. 58[P.36-1933] as a pair.  \n \n<b>Exhibited:</b> <i>La PeintureAnglaise XVIle -XIXe Siecles</i>, Louvre, Paris 1938 no. 264.  \n \n<b>Literature:</b> <i>Accessions</i> 1933, p. 62; V&A, <i>Review of Principal Acquisitions</i>, 1933, p. 22, pI. 14a; <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 9.  \n \nAt auction Cat. Nos 57 and 58 [[.36-1933] were catalogued as a pair, <i>A Count of Nassau and his Wife</i>, with no attribution. The attribution to Alexander Cooper was by Long, who also specified as the sitter William, Count of Nassau (1592- 1642), son of John II of Nassau-Siegen (156 1-1623). Long noted in the department files that the miniature was based on a portrait of William by Mierevelt engraved (posthumously) by Wilhelm Jacobsz Delft, 1644. (1) The date, from the form of the collar, and from the more deeply rounded scallops of the Flemish bobbin-lace, would be c. 1635-40. (2) \n \nThe attribution is certainly plausible, and it places Alexander Cooper exactly where, according to the documentary evidence, he should have been from the early 1630s, that is in and around The Hague with a patronage extending from the exiled Bohemians to the members of the Netherlands oligarchy. The technical affiliations of the miniature are also exactly what might have been expected - influence from Peter Oliver overlaid by the vigorous sanguine and brown facial modelling which suggests mutual awareness between Alexander and his brother Samuel Cooper. Long did not record the stylistic comparisons he would have made when attributing this miniature to Alexander Cooper, but it is clear that the portrait sits easily with both the Signed examples in the V&A, and also with the group of early Dutch portraits in the collection of the Queen of the Netherlands. (3) It is odd, therefore, that Cat. Nos 57 and 58 have been consistently omitted from the subsequent Alexander Cooper literature.  \n \n1 H van Enck, <i>Oranje-Nassau Galerij</i> 'Nijmegen-Arnhem, 1900', pl. 62. \n2 Clare Browne, personal communication, 1993. \n3 NPG 1974, nos 156-8.\"",
