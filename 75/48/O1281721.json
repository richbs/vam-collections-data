The external and internal appearance of the book show little of this verdant paradise. The imagery is dense, dark and layered, with borders and furrows with almost circuit-board style rigidity. The text inside is deeply inset; a page within a page. The lines of the poem are obscured by blocks of ink, with the odd word or phrase left to read. At some points the text underneath the ink is just about legible, lending a sense of toil about the reading, the unearthing of the poem's meaning. This book leaves the viewer with a sense of unease after experiencing its claustrophobic presence.",
