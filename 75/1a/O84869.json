It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre of Varieties, Hanley. He compiled them in a series of albums.\n\nAlthough younger than the famous performer Dan Leno, Johnny Danvers was Leno\u2019s uncle. As boys they \u2018busked\u2019 together on street corners and outside pubs. Danvers made his first stage appearance as a boy at the Alexandra, Sheffield. He later joined the Moore and Burgess and Mohawk Minstrels, becoming its leading comedian. He was in musical comedy with Seymour Hicks and made his last appearance in London at the Oxford Music Hall. He always began his songs by grinning broadly and running his fingers through his hair. Johnny Danvers appeared with Dan Leno several times in pantomime at Drury Lane in London.",
