It has no decoration.The maker trailed on the handle and tooled a small thumb-rest in the form of a disc. Examples of this type of jug were made in glass, metal and ceramic in the Middle East in the 10th and 11th centuries. It is difficult to identify more precisely where undecorated glassware was made. At one time experts thought that this jug might have been made in Egypt or Iran. The discovery of similar wares in an 11th-century shipwreck found near the Turkish coast has provided new evidence. It suggests that the jug was made in the East Mediterranean. We now think that this jug was possibly made in Egypt in the Fatimid period ( 969-1171).",
