During the 1940s and 50s he produced a number of paintings that depicted the struggles of the Argentinian people. By 1969 he was involved in the Centro de Arte y Comunicaci\u00f3n (CAYC, or the Art and Communication Centre) in Buenos Aires.  CAYC's members were concerned with the link between art and technology, and, in particular, with the use of systems in the production of art work.  Following a coup in Argentina, Berni moved to New York in 1976. He died in Buenos Aires in 1981.\n\nThis untitled screenprint was made from a computer generated drawing, created by the artist or a computer programmer. It was donated to the V&amp;A by the Computer Arts Society, and may have been included in a CAS exhibition entitled Creative Computers, which toured the UK in 1971-2. The exhibition included works by Antonio Berni, Ernesto Deira (or Delva, according to the catalogue), Ango Demarco, Osvaldo Romberg and Miguel Vidal, all of whom were involved in CAYC.\n\nA similar print by Berni was exhibited at the Tendencies 5 exhibition in Zagreb in 1973.",
