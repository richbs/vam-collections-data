The rules are similar to other 19th century moral games. Some, however, seem to be the opposite of what one might expect. For example, forfeits are given for helping people or animals while rewards are given for accepting a lift on a cart. In other games, the forfeit would be paid for this as laziness and the reward, usually counters, for the help. In contrast to the normal six-sided teetotum or spinner, the playing pieces for this game are unusual. They are made of glazed earthenware marked with the letters A to H on the tops.",
