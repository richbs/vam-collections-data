He was on the stage for 50 years, yet just  before he died he claimed modestly that he was \u2018still learning to be an actor\u2019. Both Samuel Pepys and  Alexander Pope hailed him as the best they had ever seen, and Pepys praised the restraint of his performances. Betterton's range of characters was extremely wide. He created about 130 new roles, aside  from playing such leading Shakespearean roles as Hamlet, Macbeth, King Lear and Othello. Colleague and rival Antony Aston admitted, \u2018His voice was low and  grumbling yet he could tune it by an artful climax, which enforced universal attention, even from the fops and orange-girls\u2019. \n\nBetterton was always heavily involved in the politics of theatre management, as well as being a highly regarded actor. He made his debut in 1660, the year the theatres reopened, and in 1661 was hired by  Sir William Davenant for the Duke's Company. The collapse of  rival company, the King's Men, led to a merger of the two companies in 1682. The joint result, with Betterton as the artistic leader, played at Drury Lane until 1695, when the older actors, led by Betterton, left to set up their own company at Lincoln\u2019s Inn Fields.",
