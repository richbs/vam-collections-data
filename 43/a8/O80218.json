It is assembled in four main sections, and each section compromises three sides of die stamped plate soldered together.  The base is filled.\n\nThe candlestick is on a pyramidal base of concave sides and canted corners.  The torus is decorated with a border of water leaf and tongue ornament.  Each corner is hung with a drop  of bell flowers.  The upper part of the base is decorated with a border of reeding bound with a ribbon.  The central section comprises a slender baluster enclosed by three acanthus ornamental volutes.  The baluster rests on and is capped with bands of pearling and this section rests on a circular podium made up of three, paw feet.\n\nThe etiolated capital is ornamented with a spread of overlapping leaves that fan out to create the flat drip pan.  The nozzles are made of plain cylinders.",

Sheffield plate was discovered in about 1742 by Thomas Boulsover , a Sheffield cutler.  He found that copper and silver in unequal amounts, when fused, and subjected to mechanical pressure, expanded together indefinitely at a uniform rate.  The introduction of Sheffield plate revolutionised the plating industry, for it offered an effective, relatively cheap, supremely versatile and durable technique which could convincingly imitate the surface appearance of solid silver.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe design for this candlestick exists as an engraving in a Birmingham pattern book, now in the V&A (museum no. E.2060-1952; design no. 338).  Although untitled, this book is now considered to be a pattern book from Matthew Boulton's Soho Manufactory in Birmingham, and datesable to between 1770 and 1775.  The design may have been supplied by the architect James Wyatt (1746-1813), who is known to have undertaken designs in silver and Sheffield plate for Boulton in 1776.",
