Italian goldsmiths were expert at making a little material go a very long way.  Many pieces seem too large to wear comfortably, but they are usually made of very thin gold, and are much lighter than they appear.  \n\nAll Italian women wore gold earrings.  Their shapes varied widely in different places.  The donor thought that these earrings were 17th century Sicilian.  Sicily was famous for its delicate enamel work in the 17th and 18th centuries, but those earrings were usually made of more substantial material.  These are more likely to be from Venice, or the Venetian colonies of the eastern Mediterranean.  Venice had been famous since the Middle Ages for its fine gold and filigree work.",
