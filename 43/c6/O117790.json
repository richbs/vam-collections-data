Italian (Venetian). About 1550.... The front forms a circular cartouche, with scroll ends curled over. It has a rich garland border of fruit and leaves. The centre has a carving of two dolphins. Their tails end in scrolls, which roll over and terminate in demi-figures of savage men wielding clubs and shields. The arms on the shield of the right hand figure are:-bendy of six, witha lion rampant over all. The left hand bears a double-headed imperial eagle displayed, bearing an inescutcheon, charged with a fesse. A mark is carved above, and a scallp shell below, to fill the space left by the divergence with which the figures accommodate themselves to the space. A squatting female figure is carved on the handle. The back has a cartouche on it, and marks, shells, etc., supporting it. The windpipe is formed by a grotesque quadruped, winged, and having its fore-paws aligned under the throat. The old undressed buff leather is still left on the edges, and is fastened on with rosette-shaped nails of bronze...\nPollen, J. H.
