He believed 'furniture should appear to grow out of the requirements of the room, to represent the finishing touches of a scheme which had its inception when the first stage of the house was laid'.\n\nThe design for this clock is one of over 80 furniture designs by Baillie Scott featured in a catalogue of his work called A Book of Furniture, produced in 1901.  The catalogue was produced by J.P. White, the high class joinery firm of the Pyghtle Works, Bedford, who manufactured much of Baillie Scott\u2019s work.    \n\nAs with many Arts and Crafts clocks, this clock bears text appropriate to the theme of \u2018Time\u2019.  The Latin inscription, \u2018FESTINA LENTE\u2019, translates as \u2018hurry slowly\u2019.",
