Objects were selected to fit into the following themes, In the Home, Fashion, Exploration, Technology and Fantasy.  \n\nTin toys are some of the most sought after toys today.  They cover a huge range of movement mechanisms from friction, clockwork and battery operated.  They also cover a variety of subject matters.  One of the most prominent subjects is space and space travel.  As many of these toys were produced in the era of the Space age 1957 to 1972, the makers we inspired by the optimism of the time and the public demand for all things space.  It also allowed them to create toys that are highly imaginative.  Most of these brightly coloured tin toy were manufactured in Japan.",
