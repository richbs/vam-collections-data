In the \nbackground a circle of figures dance on a  \nround platform beneath the centrally  \nplaced and named harvest moon. In the \nforeground a man and woman recline \nfacing each other, surrounded by \nchildren. The woman rests on an \ninscription (possibly in a book) adapted \nfrom Psalm 136:9. The man rests on a \nmatching inscription from Psalm 65:11. \nThis quotation is the same as that used  \nfor <i>The Valley Thick with Corn</i> (cat.15), \nwhich suggests a connection between the \ntwo designs.'",
