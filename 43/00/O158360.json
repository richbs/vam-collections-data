It is deeply chiselled with animals, real and mythical, and may have been made in one of the Deccan sultanates like Bijapur, where similar motifs may be found on architecture. These would originally have been overlaid with gold, of which traces remain. The European blade has traces of an inscription as well as the 'orb and cross' mark used by the bladesmiths of Solingen in Germany. The sword was acquired by the Indian Museum, London, in 1867 as being possibly from Indore.",
