This particular salt was manufactured for a South American Spanish colony in the first half of the 17th century.  It stands on three ball feet, and comprises three tier sections which can be dismantled to provide two drum-shaped salts and a container for spice.  Its design can be compared to contemporary Spanish architecture.\n\nThis piece is an example of domestic silver plate. Such silver was both functional and ornamental. Objects for dining and drinking took elegant forms and were decorated in the latest styles. Beautifully crafted items intended only for display often adopted functional forms such as cups and dishes. Domestic silver was not confined to the most wealthy. Many people owned silver spoons or mounted vessels, items which often became treasured possessions.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
