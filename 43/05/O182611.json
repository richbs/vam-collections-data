There is an interlining of blue plain weave cotton through which the embroidery is worked.\nYellow ground with an outer border with a green line forming an outward facing rounded arch around a small pink flowerhead.  There is a pair of leaves where the line touches the inner edge of the border.  There is a square panel in each corner quilted with a scale pattern and containing a curving floral stem with 2 flowers, leaves and buds; the stem curves to the left. The same design as the outer border forms an inner border which encloses these squares and the main border between them which is not quilted and contains a very leafy meandering stem which almost encircles 2 blossoms: an outward pointing pink one with blue segmented centre and an inward facing many petalled one in pink and white. The centre panel is quilted with a scale pattern. Two shades of green form a lobed medallion with pink spots; there is a pink, green and blue rosette in the centre.  A green 8-pointed star with small pink and white flowers encircles this and links 4 large pink and white blossoms in profile and 4 round pink blossoms.  A pair of pink serrated leaves outlined in green and a pink trefoil emerge from the top of every blossom. There is a small pink tree on every lobe with a pink and blue bird in between, a pink and white bird on the diagonal trees and a dark blue bird on the trees at the cardinal points.  A quarter of this design is in each corner with a tree and a pair of confronting birds. The ground has bands of offset floral sprigs bending to the right with a pink flower and a curving stem of leaves outlined in dark green alternating with a small pink, white and mauve flower.  All face towards the central horizontal axis. There is evidence of an older backing of gold coloured silk.\nBacking: pieced; light blue ground with white twigs, dark blue leaf and 3 pink flowers and 2 buds.\nFringe: green silk looped fringe from a woven heading.",
