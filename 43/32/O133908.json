            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of British Oil Paintings 1820-1860</i>, Ronald Parkinson, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1990, p. 141\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"LANDSEER, Sir Edwin Henry, RA (1803-1873) \nBorn London 7 March 1803,  fourth of seven children of the engraver John Landseer. Studied with BR Haydon, entered the RA Schools 1817 (at the age of 14); won annual prizes of the Royal Society of Arts 1813-17. A precocious and prodigious talent, as both painter and draughtsman, he exhibited - in a long and distinguished career - 179 works at the RA between 1815 and 1873, 94 at the BI 1818-65, and four at the SBA 1826-32. \nSubjects included portraits, but predominantly dealt with animal and human genre, often based in Scotland. Elected ARA 1826 (at the earliest permitted age), RA 1831. Received the patronage of the Russell family, and - most importantly- that of the Royal family, to whom he was Drawing Master, beginning in 1836 with the Duchess of Kent (Queen Victoria's mother); most significantly, he represented in visual form the Queen and Prince Albert's love for the life and landscape of the Scottish Highlands. Together with George IV's celebrated visit to Edinburgh 1822, and the great popularity of Sir Waiter Scott's Waverley novels, Landseer's contribution to the place of Scotland in European culture in the 19th century was considerable. The artist's own popularity was increased by the great number of reproductive prints after his works (Graves alone lists 434 by 126 engravers, see Lit below); his 'Monarch of the Glen' (exh, RA 1851), commissioned by the House of Lords but the cost refused by the House of Commons, was eventually bought by Sir Thomas Dewar and reproduced on his family firm's whisky bottle labels. Also significant was his anthropomorphic treatment of animals, particularly dogs; the Art Journal obituarist stressed that 'his dogs are not mere portraits only, they are thinking, almost rational, creatures, wanting only the gift of speech to hold converse with us'. Knighted 1850; offered PRA 1865, but refused, almost certainly because of his poor physical and mental health. Died London 1 October 1873; buried in St Paul's Cathedral. His studio sale was at Christie's 8-15 May 1874; a commemorative exhibition was held at the RA 1874/5. After the Royal Collection, the V&A possesses the largest holding of Landseer's works; there are a great many drawings and prints as well as the oils catalogued below, principally from the Sheepshanks Gift, one of the artist's most important patrons. \nLIT: \tF G Stephens The Early Works of Sir Edwin Landseer RA 1869; J Dafforne Pictures by Sir Edwin Landseer ... 1873; Art Journal 1873, p326 (obit); interleaved copy of 1874 RA exhibition catalogue, annotated by C S Mann, with photographs of prints after Landseer, 1874-7,4 vols (National Art Library, V&A); A Graves Catalogue of the Works of the Late Sir Edwin Landseer 1876; C Monkhouse entry in DNB; C Lennie Landseer: Victorian Paragon 1976; R Ormond Sir Edwin Landseer Philadelphia Museum of Art and Tate Gallery exhibition catalogue 1981 (With full bibliography). \n\nThe Dog and the Shadow \nFA89 Neg FH2114 \nPanel, 45.1 X 54.6 cm (17 \u00be X 21 \u00bd ins) Signed and dated 'E L [in monogram] 1822' bl Sheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nExhibited at the BI in 1826. In the Art Journal review of the Sheepshanks Gift, the landscape was described as 'hyper-pre-Raffaelite - valuable and curious as an early work, though less powerful than those of Sir E. Landseer's matured style'. Waagen found the dog 'very true and animated, the colouring clear, and execution careful. The general harmony, however, is somewhat disturbed by the glowing red colour of the piece of meat'. Some 30 years after these comments, English Art in the Public Galleries of London called it 'in truth, a landscape painting, weak, commonplace, and ineffective, and may probably have been undertaken as a study of background'. This strange opinion of the work may be corrected by Stephens's account of the 'official description' : \n\n'A dog with a piece of flesh in his mouth is crossing a brook by means of a fallen tree, and stops to gaze at the treacherous image of himself and his prize as reflected by the stream. A worsted cap, and some shoes on the bank indicate that a butcher's boy, who has loitered to fish or bathe, had been plundered of part of his charge'. \n\nThis is a characteristic device of Landseer, suggesting a human dimension in animal genre by the introduction of a few still-life details {see for example 'Suspense', FA99 p148}. \nEXH:  BI 1826 (182) \n\nENGR: G Cousen for Art Journal 1877, facing p328; James Scott 1885, as pl 50 of Works of Sir Edwin Landseer RA (first series 1881-93) \n\nLIT: \tG Waagen Treasures of Art in Great Britain 1854, II, p302; Art Journal 1857, p240; Stephens p47; Art Journal 1877, p328; T H Ward English Art in the Public Galleries of London nd [1888], II, p161 \n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
