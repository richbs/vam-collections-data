The front shows two children in a room: the girl is wearing a blue and white striped dress, and the boy, in grey shirt and shorts, is climbing a stepladder to hang a picture on the wall.  The picture, of a girl on a swing, shows an optical illusion: the swing appears to move backwards and forwards by means of combining several versions of the image on top of each other.  The wording reads\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY\nThe inside of the card is printed with the words \nJOLLY BIRTHDAY WISHES JUST FOR YOU !\nand the verse reads:\nYOUR BIRTHDAY'S HERE\n      AGAIN AT LAST,\nTODAY'S THE DAY FOR FUN:\nSO MAKE THIS SPECIAL \n      BIRTHDAY\nA TRULY LOVELY ONE;\nYES, SPEND IT IN \n      A JOYFUL WAY, \nFULL OF HAPPY GAMES \n      TO PLAY !",
