The ground is off-white; there is  broad border of eau-de-nil with irregular edges and then a little more off-white ground.  Most of the panel is filled with a printed image giving the effect of an oil painted portrait in a carved and gilded frame.  The 'frame' has an imperial crown in each corner and is decorated with shamrock, thistles, leeks and roses along four sides. The Queen is shown three-quarter length looking slightly to her right.  She wears an off-the-shoulder evening dress with a tightly fitted bodice and full skirt; the fabric is decorated with pale coloured flowers and is trimmed with blue velvet at the neck line.  She wears a blue sash over her left shoulder and a diamond crown, necklace, bracelet on right wrist, brooch on left shoulder, Garter badge on the sash and rings on left hand.  Her earrings are pearl and diamond and there is a silver bangle on left wrist.",
