C. A. Brooks has identified this structure as the New Fen Bridge over the Stour: it no longer exists. The same bridge is to be seen in the left hand edge of No. 109 [134-1888]. The tower of Dedham Church is seen in the distance in this drawing.\n\nNote on Nos. 58-60:\n\nThese drawings may be grouped together as all being executed with a firm underdrawing in pencil or black chalk washed with watercolour in greyish tones of green and blue, perhaps suggested by the example of Girtin. They appear to be more confident in handling than the Derbyshire sketches (Nos. 21-32 [247a-1888, 247e-1888, 247b-1888, 602-1888, 610-1888, 805-1888, 247c-1888, 601-1888, 247-1888, 247d-1888, 247f-1888, 247g-1888] of 1801, which represent the furthest advance made by Constable in this particular manner. The dated drawings nearest in style are No. 35 [239-1888], assignable to 1802, and L. B. 20a in the British Museum, of June 1806. Holmes, p. 240, lists Nos. 58-60 [214-1888, 593-1888, 592-1888] together with No. 56 [599-1888] under the year 1806.",
