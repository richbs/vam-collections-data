He was seeking designs that could be made entirely by machines and in greater volume. 'Sexy Relaxy' chairs were made in various materials including steel and wood and in limited editions as well as unlimited batch production.\nRichard Hutten (1967 Zwollerkerspel) graduated at the Academy Industrial Design Eindhoven in 1991. That same year he started his own design studio. He worked on furniture, product, interior and exhibition designs and developed his 'No sign of design' and 'Table upon table' concepts (W.21-2009). He is one of the most successful contemporary Dutch designers and a key exponent of Droog, a design company he has been involved since it's inception in 1993.",
