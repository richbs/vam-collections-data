During the 1960s most men eschewed handkerchiefs in their breast pockets, but today - as in the 1930s - they are still the choice of the well-dressed gentleman. \n\nThis pocket handkerchief was given to the Museum by Sir Roy Strong, as part of an ensemble of a navy blue three-piece Tommy Nutter suit and a white cotton Dior dress shirt. Sir Roy Strong, author, broadcaster, former Director of the National Portrait Gallery and from 1974 to1987, Director and Secretary of the Victoria and Albert Museum, was a high-profile public figure renowned for his sartorial flair. Sir Roy tended to wear this suit for public and formal occasions in his capacity as Museum Director.",
