The central panel is an indented octagon with 4 decorative corners in a grid of small squares [pulled thread work] with an infill of interlocked silk thread [a]. At the centre of the indented octagon is a regular hexagon composed of small triangles with lateral or longitudinal stitching edged with pulled thread work and reciprocal trefoils surrounded by a large octagon infilled with pattern [a], in turn surrounded with pulled thread work, a wide band on 4 sides, and narrow on the others.  Another frame of reciprocal trefoils leading into the indented octagon decorated with 8-pointed stars in satin stitch.  The central panel itself is bordered with pulled thread hexagons [b] and then by a wider band of pulled thread diagonal netting both fine and more solid, and then a repeat of [b] banding before a final edging decoration of triangles, each composed of 4 triangles.\nThere are bands of needleweaving within this design.\nCotton Thread: white, Z-spun\nEmbroidery Thread: white silk; 2S",
