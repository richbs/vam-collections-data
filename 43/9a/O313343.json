On 2 August 1914 he rejected Emperor Wilhelm II's ultimatum for the free passage of German troops through Belgium, and the German invasion followed two days later, violating Belgium's neutrality. During the course of the war, the King and Queen resided in La Panne, situated in the non-occupied zone in Southern Flanders. Although Queen Elisabeth was a daughter of Duke Karl Theodor of Bavaria (she married Albert in 1900), she remained deeply devoted to Belgium and was active on behalf of charitable institutions. In 1923 Charles Lefebure devoted his book about the Belgian medals of the First World War to her. This medal appeals for solidarity amongst the Belgian people, a theme which was predominant in Belgian war medals.",
