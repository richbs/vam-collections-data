This glass plate negative captures a fancy dress party and includes the photographer's second wife in a Pierrot costume and their son, Raymond, sitting in a group outside in a garden\nRemington's first business was thought to have been in the Greenwich area and he worked as a photographer at the Royal Naval College at Greenwich. The National Maritime Museum also hold some of his photographs in their collection.\nAfter this he moved his studio to the south coast working around the areas of Margate, Broadstairs and Brighton where this photograph, part of a series, is thought to have been taken. \nLater in his career he moved to South Devon and continued his business, Remington's Photo Service (later a limited company) in Torquay and Paignton until the late 1950s.",

He set up a photographic business, Remington's photo service, around the 1920s.\n\nHe trained as a mechanical engineer. After WWI he took up photography, initially working with glass plate cameras. Later he moved on to use a Leica 'reporter' 35mm. His first business was thought to have been in Greenwich area and he worked as a photographer at the Royal Naval college at Greenwich. The National Maritime museum also hold some of his photographs in their collection.\n\nAfter this he began to take seaside photographs in Margate, Broadstairs and Brighton areas where these photographs are all thought to have been taken. Later in his career he moved to South Devon and continued his business, Remington's photo service (later a limited company) in Torquay and Paignton until the late 1950s.",
