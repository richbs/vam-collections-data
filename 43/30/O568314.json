            "public_access_description": "This print is an illustration to a group of print depicting events during the French Revolution. Originally published serially between 1791-4, they were issued as a set of three bound volumes 'Collection compl\u00e8te des tableaux historiques de la r\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise' in 1804. The authors of the work were all actively involved in the early stages of the revolution, as was the artist of this Print, Jean-Louis Prieur.\n\nRioting spread throughout Paris from the 12 July. The people of the city were afraid of an attack by the royal guards as rumours were heard of a royal coup to bring back revolutionary Paris to heel. They were also concerned about the disturbances breaking out amongst Parisians themselves. Militias were set up, made up of ordinary working people, untrained for battle but keen to protect their city. They patrolled the streets, keeping order and readying themselves for attack. At this point, these included both women and men, as can be seen in the print. The militias were formalised on the 15th July as the National Guard was created by the people of Paris, a force made up of and loyal to the people rather than the ruling class. It was soon coped throughout France. The commander-in-chief of the new National Guard was the marquis de LaFayette, a liberal nobleman who had served as a general during the American Revolutionary war.",
