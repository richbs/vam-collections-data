The patron saint of the Abbey from which this crozier comes, Hubert, is shown here standing in the crook. At his feet is a stag crouching, with a crucifix between its antlers. This alludes to a legendary episode in the saint's life, that when hunting in the forest on Good Friday he met a stage with a crucifix between its antlers, and was converted to leading a more godly life. The Abbey owned relics of St. Hubert, and was an important pilgrimage centre. Around the knop of the crozier are cast figures and saints, one of whom is St. Beregisus, founder of the Abbey."
