            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nCandlesticks were essential domestic equipment. Before the 1780s, candles were the chief source of artificial light. Candlesticks and candles were used all over the house and moved from place to place as required. Candles could be made of tallow (animal fat), bees-wax or spermaceti (whale oil). Tallow was the cheapest of these three types. Even in the grandest households the use of candles was limited, unless entertaining. In 1774, Lady Leicester at Holkham Hall in Norfolk was reported to sew every night by the light of a single candle.\n\nMaterial, Manufacture & Design\nCandlesticks could be made of a variety of materials, including silver, Sheffield plate, pewter, brass, ceramics or glass. This candlestick is made from a metal alloy known as paktong, which consisted of copper (45%), nickel (10%) and zinc (45%). It is more hard-wearing and cheaper than silver, more resistant to damage than Sheffield plate, less liable to corrode and will take a high polish. With its close resemblance to silver, paktong provided a suitable substitute for the cost-conscious consumer. Matthew Boulton (1728-1809) of Birmingham was possibly the only manufacturer with the skills base and facilities to manufacturer both Sheffield plate (a widely used alternative to silver ) and paktong. Although, the costs of both were similar and each material had limitations of design and manufacture, Boulton preferred Sheffield plate. In 1772 he wrote that he 'no longer manufactures any quantity of the Chinese [paktong] as our plated wares can be afforded as cheap and look much better'.  This candlestick is made of cast elements which have been assembled and soldered together. The design uses the repertory of classically-inspired ornament, like the fluted column and acanthus capital, to create a candlestick in the Neo-classical style.",
