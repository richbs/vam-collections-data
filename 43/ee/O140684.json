Pieces mounted with Japanese lacquer were particularly fashionable and so strong was the demand that a lively trade in reproductions and even outright fakes soon came into being.  This small set of corner shelves (shown on the left of the image) is one of a pair, collected by the London military outfitter, John Jones. It was almost certainly made in France in the 1780s.  The set shown on the right of the image was probably made in England between about 1860 and 1880, to create a more saleable pair.  The carcase of the 18th-century piece is in oak, whereas the 19th-century set is constructed on a mahogany carcase. The decorative panels, which look like Japanese lacquer, are mainly in a European varnish technique (confusingly known as 'japanning') on both sets, but it is possible that a few of the panels on the present piece are of genuine Japanese lacquer.",
