Instead it had to be acquired through European traders making it a prestigious material, often associated with chiefs and the elite. This solid bronze example (amasongo) was worn around the arm.\n\nMuseum documentation suggests that this arm ring was taken from the body of Mzilikazi (also spelt Mosilikatze, ca.1790\u20131868), a southern African leader who founded the Matabele (Ndebele) kingdom in present-day Zimbabwe. A letter written by the donor to the Museum on 18 January 1898 notes that the arm ring \u2018was taken off the skeleton of Moselekatze [sic] \u2026 when his grave was opened \u2026 I can vouch for the authenticity of the bangle as it was given me when I was at Bulawayo in [18]96 by the man who opened the grave\u2019. Mzilikazi had been given a king\u2019s funeral and his body placed in a cave at Entumbane, on the northern periphery of the Matopo Hills.",

Fortescue.' \nLetter enclosed: \"69 Eaton Terrace, Jan. 18 1898, Dear Mr Clarke, I am sending by the bearer who brings this a small parcel, containing a bangle, the history of which is that it was taken off the skeleton of Moselekatze [name much amended by a second hand] (I think that is how the name is spelt) when his grave was opened. Some buttons which were recently exhibited in the Museum of Bulawayo were found at the same time. The bangle contains a certain percentage of gold and I was told resembled the metal used for ornaments by the Phoenicians; of this you will be a better judge than I am. I can vouch for the authenticity of the bangle as it was given me when I was at Bulawayo in '96 by the man who opened the grave. I shall be very glad to give it to the Museum, if you consider it worthy. Yours truly, (Signed) F.A. Fortescue.\"",
