            "public_access_description": "This piece is part of the Royal College of Art Visiting Artists Collection. Every year from 1987 to 2006, while David Watkins was Professor of Goldsmithing, Silversmithing, Metalwork and Jewellery at the RCA, he invited four jewellers and silversmiths from outside Britain to give a week-long masterclass. The artists brought diverse skills, aesthetics and approaches. The first call on their time was to interact closely with the students. In addition, although concentrating on their teaching and working in an unfamiliar studio, each artist generously made an object for the RCA's collection. The Royal College of Art Visiting Artists Collection, now transferred to the V&A, is a major document of international contemporary jewellery, a tribute both to the artists and to the vibrancy of the RCA as a teaching institution.\n\nArtist jewellers of the 1980s, pushing the boundaries of wearability in jewellery, were quick to recognise the advantages of the synthetic materials developed for industrial purposes. The malleability and colour range of plastics could be put to aesthetic use. \n\nRamon Puig Cuy\u00e0s is a major figure in avant-garde jewellery in Spain. He graduated at the Escola Massana in Barcelona, where he has been teaching since 1977. Initially he found inspiration in the paintings of Joan Mir\u00f3. However, the sea and his Catalan roots, and the mythical world of the Mediterranean form the main themes in his jewellery.  In 1989 he made the following statement: 'The sea has always been present in my life. Many symbolical elements in my work come from this mythical space called the sea. But many other sources have also influenced my work somehow, such as the awareness of being an heir and partaker of a history and a culture, into which my work enters a new element'. (Ramon Puig Cuy\u00e0s, Workshop Drawings, Barcelona 1995, p.70)\n\nDuring this period he was making a series called 'Impressions of Atlantis'.",
