Both the Clowes family and their cousins the Tillers were operating touring marionette shows around Great Britain from the 1860s onwards.\n\nThe figure is an interesting example of the white-faced clown puppets made for the popular marionette pantomimes. It has a moveable mouth and is therefore a 'patter' clown, designed to 'talk'.",

            "bibliography": "Transcript of a broadcast made by Harry Whanslaw at the BBC, 16 October 1936. British Puppet and Model Theatre Guild Collection, ref: D.28 in DB3\n'The other day my brother-in-law came on an old box lying on the ground in Southampton.  He lifted the lid and found that it was full of old marionettes.  Knowing my interest in them, he made enquiries and discovered that they had originally belonged to a troupe called the Clowes Excelsior Marionettes, rnm by Tiller and Clowes, the famous Victoriam fair-ground owners.  Clowes was an extroardinary man.  It is said that for one fortnight he out on a different marionette show every evening - a really remarkable performance.\n\nWhen he died the family lost interet, and the puppets were left lying out in the field - some not even in a box.  We bought them from the owner of the field but it was some while before we discovered all the bits.  The skeleton, for instance, came in three distinct pieces - first the head, then one leg, and a couple of arms.  They are now strung up in their original form, and I hope to show them at exhibition next week.\n\nThe troupe contained all the stock artists - Stiltwalkers, Chinese bell-dancers. extending clowns, elephant, donkey-cart, harlequinade, and Nigger Minstrel troupe. \n\nThis is the first time these puppets will have been shown for years.  Sir Henry Irving once went to one of Clowes' shows, and asked what the average takings were.  Clowes said he thought about five punds, and Sir Henry offered him that sum if he would do a private show at Tenterden.  The audience consisted of Ellen Terry, her daughter, Miss Edith Craig, Sir Henry and the dog.  Ellen Terry was delighted with them, and wrote glowingly of them in her autobiography.'",
