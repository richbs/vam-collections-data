Copper is easily worked and retains its strength. It also conducts heat. Brass handles allow this dish to be carried without risk of burnt fingers. An electroplated liner inside protects the food from being contaminated by the copper.\n\nBenson was a friend of William Morris, who nicknamed him 'Mr Brass Benson' and encouraged him to set up a metal-working business. Benson had a factory in Hammersmith and a showroom in London\u2019s stylish West End. His designs revived the use of copper, and made it a fashionable material for the wealthy classes to own. Unlike some arts and crafts contemporaries Benson used machines, although his style was in keeping with the movement. He designed for Morris & Co. and took over the firm when Morris died.. He was also a member of the Art Workers Guild and a founder of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society in 1888. In 1914, Benson's factory was used to manufacture munitions for the First World War. Having no heirs, Benson decided to close down the works in 1920.",
