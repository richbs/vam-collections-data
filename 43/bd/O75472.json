This is a cast used for the production of the bronze bust of Alfred Stevens by Lanteri acquired by the Tate Gallery, London, in 1911 (inv. no. NO2853), presented by the Alfred Stevens Memorial Committee. Apparently Lanteri used photographs and advice from those who personally knew Stevens to produce this likeness.\n\nLanteri (1848-1917), a sculptor and medallist from Burgundy who had trained in Paris, settled in England in 1872 and was naturalised in 1901. At the age of 23 he became chief assistant to Sir Joseph Edgar Boehm, a position he held until Boehm's death in 1890. In 1874 Lanteri was appointed Master of Modelling at the National Art Training School (now the Royal College of Art, London), and in 1900 became the first Professor of Modelling. In 1905 and 1906 he supervised students working on the figures of Fame, Sculpture and Architecture for the Exhibition Road fa\u00e7ade of the V&A Museum.",
