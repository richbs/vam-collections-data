The hunters' heads are covered by turbans with a strip of material passing under their chins.  The one in the front is slightly bent forwards and holds an object with both hands. The one behind him is walking with his right leg placed behind the left one, and he looks up to the small tree with his head titled backwards.  A dead animal with bound legs hangs down from upper aend of the arch on his left shoulder.  Behind him there appears the turbaned head of a third hunter.",
