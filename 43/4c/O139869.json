The designs were made in about 1859-1862 by Francis Skidmore, (1817-1896), who was a leading Victorian metalworker. Now little known, Skidmore was once famous as the maker of the Albert Memorial (1863-1876) and the Hereford Screen (which was exhibited in London at the International Exhibition of 1862). Sir George Gilbert Scott (1811-1878) designed both the memorial and the screen and employed Skidmore to execute them. Skidmore also produced church plate, light fittings, and furniture but was best known for his innovative architectural ironwork. Based in Coventry, Skidmore worked for some of the leading designers of the Gothic Revival movement, particularly Sir George Gilbert Scott. Skidmore's career peaked in the 1860s when his factory employed over 100 staff but due to ill health and he died in relative poverty.\n\nThese designs are highly finished presentation drawings to be shown to the client. They show semi-precious stones in a metalwork mount of the type on both the Albert Memorial and the Hereford Screen.",
