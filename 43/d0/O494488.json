            "public_access_description": "Manufacture og glazed stoneware ceramics in Cambodia coincided with the rapid expansion of urbanisation under the Khmer empire centred at Angkor. The earliest production center was on Phnom Kulen, the plateau mountain to the north-east of Angkor and the site of the first of the Angkorian-period Khmer capitals, that of Jayavarman II (802-about 830). Kilns have been located on Mount Kulen in the presumed vicinity of his capital. \n\nGlazed ceramics continued to be made in the vicinity of the capital, which was relocated several times during the Angkorian period (from the ninth to the end of the thirteenth century). recent excavations of kiln sites in the region confirm that production was associated with both urban and ritual centers. Roof tiles abound at all sites, as well as functional wares and a number of categories of more specialised forms seemingly associated with temple life and ritual.\n\nVessels incorporating animal forms in their design were particularly popular in the later Angkorian period, as on this piece, which has a handle in the shape of a bird. Many of these vessels with residual animal forms have a wide neck aperture and are often encrusted with traces of lime, indicating that they were containers for the lime associated with betel chewing. This example, however, has a constricted neck and a functioning spout, and was probably a domestic pouring vessel. The vast majority of surviving brown-glazed Khmer ceramics have been excavated, often in the vicinity of temples, in those regions of north-east Thailand that once formed part of the Khmer empire.",
