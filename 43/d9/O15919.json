It shows three different papers - the dado (lower portion), the filling (middle portion) and the frieze (upper portion). The three were printed in a single drop. They were then displayed in a showroom or trade exhibition to demonstrate the effect to potential customers. C. L. Eastlake first described wall decorations divided in this way in his Hints on Household Taste (1868). He recommended such schemes as a way of breaking up the monotony of a single pattern on the wall. They became a popular feature of Aesthetic Movement interiors, printed in muted \u2018art\u2019 colours that owed much to William Morris\u2019s influence. A writer in the Journal of Decorative Art in 1886 set out the rules for designing such papers: \u2018the frieze should be light and lively; richer colours should be employed than in the filling, and it should be as striking to the eye as the dado\u2019. The filling was generally the least assertive pattern of the three. It was the largest area of the wall and thus formed the background to any paintings hung from the picture rail.",
