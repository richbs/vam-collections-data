The sides are wavy indicating uneven warp tension.\n\nWEFT: light brown wool; Z2S; 2 shoots after each row of knots; 8 knots per inch (32 per dm).\n\nPILE: wool; 7 colours: red, dark yellow, yellow, light yellow, blue, dark brown, white; symmetrical knot tied around 2 warp threads; 64 knots per sq. inch (1056 per sq. dm).\n\nSIDE FINISH: one cord oversewn with yellow wool.\n\nEND FINISH:  Lower: 2 cms plainweave with light brown wool; the first weft is a thick cord.  There is twisted warp fringe, max. 5.5 cms. long.  Upper: missing.\n\nDESIGN: Field: blue ground with three vertical rows of off-set stepped octagons, each has the same interior design of a black cross overlaid with motifs with red or dark brown lines tracing pairs of horns.  The two uppermost medallions are entirely geometric and contain a yellow lozenge with 4 angular crescents.  Along both sides of the field are hooked concentric triangles.  Scattered across the ground are birds, rosettes, flowerheads, etc.\n\nMain border: dark brown ground with kufesque brackets in white enclosing the motif found within each octagon from the field, always in white.\n\nInner and outer borders: white ground with serrated 'S' motifs in red, blue, dark brown and 2 shades of yellow.\n\nNB: There have been several rectangular tabs sewn along one side and one end at the back (for display); these seem to have stained the back of the carpet yellow.",
