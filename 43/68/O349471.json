At the top, the Virgin, haloed, lies on a bench, a star above her head a little to the right. Below the Child, haloed, les in an oval crib. Below again two midwives bath the Child in a tub- the Child stands in the tub, the midwife on the righ supports Him while the midwife on the left holds a jug over His head; a third midwife, Salome (?), looks on from the left. \n\nThe crystal, slightly scratched and abraded with a large chip gashing through the Child in the tub is carved in reverse intaglio, masked by a segment of crystal a the back, the two bound by a gold collar chased with a guilloche pattern. The complex is suspended from a ribbed loop on a chain of finely plaited gold wire bearing a sliding round terminal and clasps. Originally, gold foil was probably placed between the two segements of crystal.",
