It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years. Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\n Late Night Final came to Brighton after its London run at the Phoenix Theatre which began in June 1931. Godfrey Tearle originally played Randall, the editor of the rather disreputable tabloid New York newspaper The Evening Gazette. Raymond Massey replaced him in London, and Paul Neville played the part on tour. In Brighton the role of the appalling religious editor was played by Robert Morley.",
