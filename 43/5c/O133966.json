Studied at the life school in St Martin's Lane, and exhibited watercolours at the Society of Arts as early as 1836. Exhibited 164 works at the RA between 1838 and 1902 (and 50 Egyptian studies there in 1869), 33 at the BI 1839-41. His early works were mostly village genre scenes in the manner of Sir David Wilkie (whose works he also copied), but after travelling in Egypt in the late 1850s his work was principally Egyptian and biblical in subject, beginning with the ten-foot long painting 'Arabian Encampment at the Wells of Moses' in 1860. After 1889, he painted some English landscapes and a few portraits. Elected ARA 1852, RA 1863. Travelled in Normandy 1838, 1839 and 1840, Brittany 1841, 1842 and 1845, North Wales 1843, Ireland 1844, Venice 1857, and Egypt 1858-9 and 1870. Died St John's Wood, London, 28 August 1904. Two of his sons, Frederick Trevelyan (see below) and Howard, were also artists. Sales of his collections were at Christie's 25 May 1893 and (in the name of his daughter Ricca) 20 February 1905; there seems also to have been a sale at his house in Avenue Road, because of financial difficulties, in November 1902. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i>1850, p213 (a short 'autobiography'), 1855, ppl09-12; F Goodall Reminiscences 1902; <i>Art Journal</i> 1904, pp301-2 (obit); N G Slarke <i>Frederick Goodall</i>, RA Peterborough 1981\n\n<b>The Irish Piper</b> \n530-1882 Neg 68174/l0 \nPanel, 29.2 x 40.6 cm (11\u00bd x 16 ins) \nSigned and dated 'F Goodall/l847' br \nJones Bequest 1882 \n\nPreviously catalogued as 'The Bagpiper', but exhibited under the above title at the BI in 1848, the size given in the catalogue as '20 by 24 inches'. Goodall mentioned it in his 1850 <i>Art Journal</i> article as one of the results of his 1844 visit to Ireland. The <i>Athenaeum</i> critic thought the flesh tints too red, but the picture was considered the best of Goodall's four 81 exhibits: 'It is full of appropriate incident. The several inmates of the dwelling are discriminated with nice gradation of feeling and interest'. The <i>Art Union</i> described it as 'exquisite in colour, and admirable in execution'. \n\nGoodall stated in 1850 that the picture belonged to W J Broderip; it did not appear in William John Broderip's posthumous sale at Christie's 11 June 1859 (nor in Francis Broderip's sale of 6 February 1872). On the back of the panel is written: 'The Original Picture from which was repeated a larger one for The Art Union of London with the permission of W J Broderip Esqr.'. \n\nLike his other paintings of the 1840s and 1850s, this shows the influence of Sir David Wilkie, particularly in this case 'The Blind Fiddler' of 1806 (Tate Gallery). Redford (<i>Sales</i>) lists two other similar subjects in the saleroom, in 1855 'The Blind Piper' and in 1865 'The Piper'; the latter was 'The Piper: a scene in Brittany' sold at Christie's 8 April 1865 (142, 30.1 x 43.1 cm/12 x 17 ins). \n\nEXH: BI 1848(84)\n \nLIT: <i>Athenaeum</i> 19 February 1848, p194; <i>Art Union</i> 1848, p82; <i>Art Journal</i> 1850, p213\"",
