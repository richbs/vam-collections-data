Their act, billed as 'Romance in Porcelain', was known as an adagio act, in which the petite acrobat Juanita progressed from swinging as the pendulum of an outsize decorative mantel clock to the music of  The Blue Danube to being thrown, spun, twirled and caught by the Ganjou Brothers, also supposedly figures on the clock, dressed in powdered wigs, tights, decorated waistcoats and billowing shirts.\n\nThe Polish brothers Bob and George Ganjou started the original act in the United States, performing with another male dancer, and the female dancer Natacha Natova. When she went solo, her place was taken in 1931 by Juanita Richards, born in Detroit. She was the Juanita who performed at the Royal Variety Show in 1933 but when she left the act she was replaced by the second 'Juanita', Joy Marlow (1912-1980), another dancer who stayed with the act throughout the 1940s and 1950s when they went to Hollywood and regularly appeared on television. They did their last tour in 1956 and in 1958 Joy Marlow married Serge Ganjou who joined his brothers in the act in the 1930s.",
