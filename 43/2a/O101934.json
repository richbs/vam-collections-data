            "public_access_description": "This armchair was part of a range of furniture designed for a north London flat commissioned by Mrs Dora Ventris in advanced modernist style from the Hungarian-born, former Bauhaus teacher Marcel Breuer.  The flat was located in a tall building designed by architect Erno Goldfinger known as \u2018Highpoint\u2019.  Built-in and free-standing furniture was designed by Breuer to organize the space, including a pair of these chairs and a matching sofa.  They were made in Bristol from large, cut-out sheets of plywood for the frame and moulded plywood armrests. Their organic, curvilinear geometry represented a departure from the severe rectilinear geometry of Breuer\u2019s earlier work on the Continent.  The cut-out elements were simple and relatively inexpensive to cut, also representing a departure from Breuer moulded plywood furniture.",
