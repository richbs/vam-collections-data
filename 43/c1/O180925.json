One of the crafts for which Italy was noted was carving, and Luigi Frullini, who carved this panel for the Paris International Exhibition in 1878, was one of the most celebrated carvers in Florence. His skills suited the delicate arabesque decoration that formed an important element in the fashionable Renaissance Revival style. The taste for naturalistic design, common throughout Europe at this time, also allowed him to show off the precision of his carving in the figures of the birds.  This pilaster panel and its pair (691-1878) were bought directly from the 1878 exhibition for the South Kensington Museum (the forerunner of the V&A) as examples of pre-eminent carving skill.",
