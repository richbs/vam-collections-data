Combining historical references (such as the appearance of slashed fabric, a nod to the style of the 16th century) with the large-shouldered silhouette of the decade, it is an over-the-top confection that is perhaps more costume than fashion. \n\nLondon-born Helene Hayes was brought up in New South Wales, Australia. She moved to Paris in the early 1960s to study sculpture. She began working in the fashion business in 1965 as a manager in the house of Jean Louis Scherrer. From the early 1980s, Helene Hayes operated her Parisian couture boutique first at 2 rue de Tournon and then at 42 Avenue Montaigne. Her clients included Mrs Rupert Murdoch, Mrs Henry Ford, Mrs Gordon Getty, Mme Claude Picasso and Mme Juliette May Ray.",
