At that time the Yongle Emperor sent seven expeditions from China to south-east Asia and the Middle East, led by the eunuch admiral Zheng He. Historians believe that large dishes of this type were given as diplomatic gifts.\n\nThe Chinese usually served food in small or medium-sized dishes, but not large ones such as this. Large dishes were made primarily for sale to the countries of central or south-east Asia. A significant quantity of both green-glazed stoneware and blue-and-white porcelain has survived there today.",
