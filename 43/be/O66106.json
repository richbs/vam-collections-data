            "public_access_description": "This is one of many panels in the Victoria & Albert Museum's collection of stained glass from the Abbey of Steinfeld in Germany. It was originally in the fifteenth window in the abbey cloister.\n\nDuring the Revolutionary struggles in France and the subsequent religious upheavals under Napolean, many monastic institutions on the continent were 'secularised' and their buildings destroyed. The abbey of Steinfeld was closed down in 1802 but prior to that in 1785 the stained glass windows of the cloister had been taken down. It is believed that they were purchased, probably at the time of the closure in 1802, by John Christopher Hampp of Norwich. Hampp sold the Steinfeld panels to various churches and to private collections. Many of these were purchased by the collector, Lord Brownlow, who had them installed in his new chapel at Ashridge Park in Hertfordshire between 1811 and 1831.\n\nIn 1928 the contents of Ashridge Park were sold at auction and a private collector purchased the stained glass and gave it to the Victoria & Albert Museum.\n\nThe scheme of cloister glazing at the Praemonstratensian abbey of Steinfeld was commissioned by its abbot, Johann von Ahrweiler (1517-1538).\n\nWe know the layout of the windows of the cloister glazing at Steinfeld from an illustrated manuscript that was made in 1632 and was housed at Trier. \nAnother manuscript showing the arrangement of the windows is in the state archives in Dusseldorf. This dates from 1719.\n\nThe figure depicted here is Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, standing gazing at the Cross on which he was crucified. He is also displaying the wounds he incurred during his crucifixion. This type of devotional image is known as a 'Man of Sorrows'. This imagery developed from the cults devoted to the wounds of Christ and was particularly popular in Germany in the late medieval period.\n\nThe arms depicted in the bottom left-hand corner of this panel are those of Wilhelm Wilne. He was Provost of Heinburg (a provost is a high-ranking church official).\n\n'Blazoning' is the term used to describe the colours and emblems on a coat of arms. The description for these arms would be argent (silver), a chief gules (red), two rosettes or (gold) in escutcheon (small shield) across engrailed gules (red).\n\nAn accompanying panel in this window depicted Wilhelm Wilne and his patron saint St John. The arms were originally part of this panel but are now joined with the 'Man of Sorrows' panel.",

Subsequently given to the museum by the purchaser Mr. E. E. Cook.\n\nThe glazing programme of the cloister at the Premonstratensian abbey of Steinfeld, in the Eifel region between Cologne and Trier, was executed between about 1522 and 1557. The work was carried out consecutively, window by window, starting at the north-west and running around the cloister, taking in twenty-seven windows in all. With a few exceptions, these were three-light windows with tracery lights above. The three-panelled main lights were invariably divided into two parts, with narrative scenes occupying the middle and upper panels, and donor figures mostly filling the \u2018socle\u2019 zone below. The master glazier responsible for the windows up to about 1537-8 appears to be Gerhard Remisch (or Remsich), whose monogram appears in window no. 13, made in 1534 (see C.211-1928).
