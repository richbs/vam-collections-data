It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years.  Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn\u2019t needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nDouble Harness by Edward Poor Montgomery opened at Brighton on 8 May 1933 for a week, as part of the post-London tour.  Advertised in Brighton as: 'direct from the Haymarket and Apollo Theatres', a review praised it as a powerful production 'which speaks quite plainly about the pitfalls of marriage, and although very modern is devoid of cynicism'. It also noted that 'Mr Harold Anstruther is also admirable as Rockingham.' In London Rockingham was played by Owen Nares, with Mary Ellis as Sybil Livingstone, the part played on tour by Dorothy Neave.",
