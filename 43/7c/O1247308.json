The figures were bought in 1937 and are mostly made by the master puppet maker Arthur Quisto (1882-1960).\n\nMr Punch was first recorded in England in 1662 by the famous diarist Samuel Pepys when he saw him as a marionette, operated in Covent Garden by the Italian puppet showman Signor Bologna. Pulchinella, as he was then called, was presented within a tent rather than in the type of booth we know today. Pepys brought his wife to see the show two weeks later and that October the same show was performed at Whitehall for the King. \n\nIn the Punch and Judy show written by Professor Bavister the Doctor is called for by Mr Punch after the crocodile has bitten his nose. Punch tells the Doctor that he's dead, which the Doctor refuses to believe but takes his pulse and then gives him some 'physic' in the form of a beating with a stick. Punch gives the Doctor a taste of his own 'medicine', beating him, knocking him senseless and sweeping him off the stage before the Policeman appears.",
