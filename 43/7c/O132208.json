He exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1863 and 1891. For the first four years his landscape and genre subjects had Middle Eastern settings, suggesting that he had travelled there prior to 1863. <u>Caravan halting at a well in the desert</u> was the first painting he showed at the Royal Academy (1863, no.336). After 1866 Herbert began to specialise in history and genre painting and occasionally exhibited portraits. \n\nThis painting was bequeathed to the V&A by Joshua Dixon (1811-1885), a successful cotton merchant. In addition to oil paintings, watercolours and drawings, his collection also included engravings, Japanese vases and panels, and bronze and marble sculpture. Born in Dalston, north-east London, Dixon died on his estate of Winslade Park in Somerset and left his collection initially to the Bethnal Green Museum, which is part of the V&A, for the 'benefit of the people of East London.'",
