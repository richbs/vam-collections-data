            "physical_description": "Cut silk velvet embroidered with couched metal thread worked through a backing of loosely woven cotton; two pieces joined together.  Evidence of a backing of resist-dyed and block printed cotton. The two pieces may have been the end borders of a larger, rectangular textile. \nThe central panel is dark green velvet and the added border is very worn golden brown velvet, faded from red [the red can be seen in a seam on the reverse]. \nConfronting birds form a diamond lattice containing a floral spray with three flowers and many leaves.  The threads are couched over a padding of silk threads.  The motifs are outlined with 2 metal threads twisted together.\nThe border pattern consists of the same confronting birds but with shorter tails, amid a meandering stem with blossoms.\nMetal thread: silver strip close S-wound on a white silk core and silver-gilt close S-wound on yellow silk.  The silver-gilt can been seen on the reverse in the section of unfaded border velvet. On the back two colours of couching thread can be seen, white and yellow, indicating that both silver and silver-gilt were used throughout.\nThe remains of the backing show a dark brown ground with an off-set pattern of a small floral sprig: yellow stem and leaves and red and white flower.\nSee T.180-1909.",
