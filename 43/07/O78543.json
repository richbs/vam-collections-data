Silver canisters could be sold in pairs for green (unfermented) and black (fermented) tea or in a set of three fitted within a wooden or leather case. The third, and larger, container was for sugar. The cases and even the tea canisters, as here, often have a lock, as tea was initially an expensive luxury confined to the wealthy. A gradual fall in price allowed tea to be drunk more widely during the 18th century, especially after import duties were cut in 1784. Tea was prepared by the lady of the house in front of family and guests in the drawing room, not by servants in the kitchen. Taking tea was an important form of entertainment in society, and this was reflected in the elegance and richness of the tea utensils. Canisters are therefore often highly decorative.\n\nDesign & Cost\nThe simple cube form of this tea canister is based on the wooden chests in which the tea would have been imported from China. This East Asian styling shows that tea had not lost its exotic character, although the influence has been Westernised by adding Neo-classical swags and vase motifs to the richly engraved surface. This shape was known as a tea tub  in the 18th century. A certain Charles Kent purchased a square tea tub from the goldsmiths Parker & Wakelin for \u00a37 7s 5d in 1772.",
