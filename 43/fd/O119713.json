In his hands he holds a pair of gloves and a tall drinking glass.  The name in German for this stoneware vessel type is \"Sturzkrug\".  This means that it is a jug which the drinker is obliged to keep hold of until empty to avoid the contents pouring out - as it can only balance when resting on its mouth.  Such drinking jugs were used for wine or small quantities of strong beer.  The Sturzkrug would have been a more expensive variation of the basic undecorated Trichterhalskrug and would therefore have appealed to social groups such as artisans and merchants.  Other examples of the anthropomorphous Sturzkrug are known, but the type is much rarer than the plain funnel-necked drinking jug or even than jugs decorated with applied relief-moulded medallions.\nThe white stoneware jug was made in Siegburg, an abbey town on the River Sieg about 12km. east of Bonn.  There has been a pottery industry in Siegburg from at least 1150, with exports including stoneware from the mid-13th century and a potters' guild from about 1400.  The local cream-coloured clay was fine and pure and fuel was freely available in the form of timber from local forests.  In the 16th century, there were about fifteen major workshops in Siegburg.  It is not known which workshop produced this particular jug.  In 1632, Siegburg was destroyed by the Swedes during the Thirty Years' War.",

            "history_note": "This jug was made in Siegburg, an abbey town on the River Sieg about 12km. east of Bonn where the river joins the Rhine.  It was one of many objects presented to the Museum by Lieut.-Col. Kenneth Dingwall D.S.O through the Art Fund, but its earlier provenance is not recorded.\n\nHistorical significance: There has been a pottery industry in Siegburg from at least 1150, with exports including stoneware from the mid-13th century and a potters' guild from about 1400.  Most of the workshops were just outside the town walls and by the time this jug was made, there existed about fifteen major workshops consisting of masters from several main potting families, their workmen and the apprentices who served a seven year apprenticeship.  It is not known which workshop produced this particular jug.  Except for the 1580s when wars caused some potters to move away, the Siegburg industry was at its peak between 1550 and 1632 when the town was destroyed by Swedes in the Thirty Years' War.\n   The local cream-coloured clay, dug from shallow pits, was fine and pure and required little added sand to temper it ready for firing to a high temperature to make stoneware.  Fuel was freely available from local forests although in 16th century, stocks of timber gradually became less plentiful.  The jug was thrown on a fast wheel then the handle and  moulded head and arms were separately applied to the jug when leather-hard i.e. partially dried.  Finally the piece was finished off with incised decoration.  Other examples of the anthropomorphous Sturzkrug are known, but the type is much rarer than the undecorated funnel-necked drinking jug or even than those decorated with applied relief-moulded medallions.",

            "historical_context_note": "Stoneware was ideal for drinking vessels as it is non-porous even when  left unglazed and a stronger material than earthenware or glass.  This \"Sturzkrug\" is an amusing variation on the \"Trichterhalskrug\" or funnel-necked drinking jug.   The term \"Sturzkrug\" means that it is a jug which the drinker is obliged to keep hold of until empty or otherwise the contents would pour out - it can only balance when upturned.  Such drinking jugs were used for wine or small quantities of strong beer.  The Sturzkrug would have been a more expensive variation of the basic undecorated Trichterhalskrug and would therefore have appealed to social groups such as artisans and merchants.",
