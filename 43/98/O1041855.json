The edges of the card have been divided into equal distances with the knife, doubtless to assist the engraver. \n\nNo. 401 [341-1888] is the original drawing for an engraving by A. R. Freebairn. A copy of the engraving is mounted with the water-colour: its engraved surface measures 65 x 95 mm. and it is lettered <i>Constable, R.A.... Freebairn</i>; it follows No. 401 [341-1888] with the exception of the fisherman on the bridge, who is standing upright, with a more visible rod, in the print. The original pencil sketch from nature of the scene, measuring about 4 1/2 x 7 ins., is in the collection of Col. J. H. Constable (L. ed. S., p. 11, exhibited at Colchester, 1950, No. 15). Constable himself made an etching of the scene: an example is in the Department of Prints and Drawings (No. 20142). \nThe proof of Freebairn's engraving after No. 401 [341-1888] in the British Museum is inscribed in pencil, presumably by the engraver: <i>Toutched by J. Constable RA 30 April 1836. (first & only time)</i>. Mr. David Gould and Mr. O'Dwyer have shown that it was published in 1837 in the second volume of <i>The Book of Gems</i>, edited by S. C. Hall. It appears on p. 189 as the headpiece to an extract from Thomas Warton's <i>An Ode to Summer</i>, and is given the title 'The English Landscape' in the list of plates. \n\nNo. 401 [341-1888] was, through being confused with No. 123 [342-1888], described as 'Stoke Mill, Ipswich' in the <i>Catalogue of Water-colour Paintings</i>, 1927, p. 113.\"",

He gave four lectures on 'The History of Landscape Painting' at the Royal Institution in May and June of this year and his last lecture, at Hampstead, on 25 July. Constable died on 31 March 1837. His almost completed painting 'Arundel Mill and Castle' (now in the Toledo Museum of Art, Toledo, Ohio; see No. 379 [260-1888]) was exhibited posthumously at the Royal Academy.' \n                                 \t\n[G Reynolds, 1973, p. 233]",
