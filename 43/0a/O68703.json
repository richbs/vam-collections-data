She has her hair tied back neatly, her eyes emphasised and  a bindi on her forehead which indicates her 'traditional' character. She is set against a background scene of a beautiful island setting with sea, palm trees and a boat. Above her in the top left hand corner is the immediately recognisable line-drawn portrait of Rabindranath Tagore with his  long flowing beard and long white hair. The film is based on one of his novels. He is in shades of grey and contrasts with full colour of the rest of the poster. The English title runs across the top right hand corner of the poster with the Hindi title below in a much smaller size. The artist's signature is on the top left hand corner.",
