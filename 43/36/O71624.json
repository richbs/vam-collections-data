He looks to the right at the bearded Judas who stands next to him, embracing him, his left hand resting on Christ's shoulder. A soldier, wearing 14th-century style armour, with a pointed basinet and visor, a tippet of mail, elbow- and knee-guards and a jerkin with a sword hanging from a sword belt, grasps Christ's cloak with his left hand and his sword handle with his right. Four other soldiers, three holding bills and one a battle-axe, and a civilian wearing a hat with a rolled brim, surround them. The tonsured and bearded figure of St. Peter, wearing a girded gown and a cloak, stands on Christ's right, looking up at him, holding a sword in the scabbard. At his feet, lying across the width of the panel is a figure wearing a low-belted doublet and a hat with a rolled brim, his left hand raised and holding a staff in his right. This figure represents Malchus, the high priest's servant, attempting to ward off the blow from St. Peter who has cut off his ear and is shown replacing the sword. \n\nThe top corners of the panel are chipped. An earlier photograph of the panel shows a lantern in the top centre supported by the civilian's hand--both hand and lantern are now missing. Part of the shaft of the battle-axe on the right of the panel is missing. The soldiers and the civilian have darkened faces to show their villainy, although curiously the face of Judas appears to be just as free of paint as the faces of Christ and St. Peter. Green paint and the usual daisy pattern remain on the ground. Traces of red and gilt paint remain on the figures. There appears to be blue (darkened) on Christ's robe. The background is gilt at the top of the panel, with traces of gesso knobs. The back of the panel is incised with a fishbone-shaped mark. There are three lead-plugged holes in the back. The bottom has been cut away.",

Here Judas is shown embracing Christ \u2013 his kiss was the sign for the soldiers to carry out the arrest. The soldiers\u2019 faces have been darkened to show their wickedness. One the left is St Peter, who has just cut off the ear of the fallen soldier.\n\nThere are two sorts of alabaster. Calcite alabaster is very hard and was used in ancient times. This object is made of gypsum alabaster which is a fine-grained, soft and smooth stone. Although at first glance it looks a little like marble, which it was intended to imitate, it was much easier to carve due to its softness, and alabaster objects were therefore significantly cheaper to produce. Marble does not originate in England, so it was imported if needed, whereas in the 15th century there were important alabaster quarries in Nottingham, York, Burton-on-Trent and London. England was a major centre for the production of objects such as this one. During period, they were exported in very large numbers to Europe where they survive, unlike many examples which remained in England and were destroyed or greatly damaged during the Reformation.",
