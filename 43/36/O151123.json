During the Gothic revival, Herbert Minton developed techniques for producing inlaid tiles in medieval style, which went into production at Minton and Co. from the 1830s. \n\nThe same techniques were used to create other works, such as this tray designed around 1850 by renowned Gothic revivalist Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin.\n\t\nMinton created inlaid decoration by impressing a pattern into the soft clay. These impressions were then filled with coloured liquid clays, before the piece was dried and fired. The contrast between the different coloured clays gave a rich finish.",
