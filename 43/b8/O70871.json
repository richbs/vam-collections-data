However, when the V&A acquired the set in 1857, curators thought these pieces were Italian because their shape is more typical of mainland European models. Another reason for this confusion is that, from about 1600 to 1700, European goldsmiths deliberately copied Gujarati mother-of-pearl work in similar shapes. This created problems of identification for scholars that still exist today.",
