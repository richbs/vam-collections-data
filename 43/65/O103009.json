Another figure is identified by a pencilled note on the mount as Parisot; although she is usually shown with one breast uncovered; however she does look very like prints of the plumply pretty Parisot. The figure on the right plinth copies the pose of the Venus de Medici. \nThe satire refers to Bishop Barrington's attack on the French dancers in the House of Lords during the reading of a divorce bill.  He protested they were sent by France to undermine British morality 'by the allurement of the most indecent attitudes, and most wanton theatrical exhibitions \u2026.'  He attributed the increase in divorce to such displays and asked for the King to suppress these 'indecent spectacles.'  Many people criticised the skimpy and diaphanous costumes worn by the French dancers at this time.",

            "history_note": "The figure on the right is clearly Charles Didelot\u2019s wife Mme Rose, whose sharp features figure in several satires of the 1790s.  Another figure may be Mlle Parisot; although she is usually shown with one breast uncovered.  \nThe satire refers to Bishop Barrington\u2019s attack on the French dancers in the House of Lords during the reading of a divorce bill.  He protested they were sent by France to undermine British morality \u2018by the allurement of the most indecent attitudes, and most wanton theatrical exhibitions \u2026.\u2019  He attributed the increase in divorce to such displays and asked for the King to suppress these \u2018indecent spectacles.\u2019  Many people criticised the skimpy and diaphanous costumes worn by the French dancers at this time. \nThe print is part of the collection of dance prints amassed by Marie Rambert and her husband, Ashley Dukes in the first half of the 20th century.  Eventually numbering 145 items, some of which had belonged to the ballerina Anna Pavlova, it was one of the first and most important specialist collections in private hands.  \nRambert bought the first print as a wedding present but could not bear to give it away.  As the collection grew, it was displayed in the bar of the Mercury Theatre, the headquarters of Ballet Rambert, but in 1968, Rambert gave the collection to the Victoria and Albert Museum; seven duplicates were returned to Rambert, but these are catalogued in Ivor Guest's A Gallery of Romantic Ballet, which was published before the collection came to the V&A.  Although often referred to as a collection of Romantic Ballet prints, there are also important engravings of 17th and 18th century performers, as well as lithographs from the later 19th century, by which time the great days of the ballet in London and Paris were over.",
