Despite its archaic appearance, it probably dates back no further than the late eighteenth century.  Heavy silver rings of this type, often with the image of St Anthony of Padua on the bezel, were very common in south Germany and Upper Austria in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, where they were worn by men.  They were probably intended to be used aggressively, as a weapon, rather than for decorative purposes.",
