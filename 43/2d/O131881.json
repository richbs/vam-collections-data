Rotch, 1962.\n\nHistorical Significance: John Opie (1761-1807) was born in Cornwall and apprenticed to a carpenter, following in his father\u2019s trade, before coming to the attention of a local doctor, John Wolcot (1738-1819), who became his mentor. On moving to London, Opie became known as \u2018the Cornish Wonder\u2019 after his work was received with great acclaim, reputedly prompting Sir Joshua Reynolds to liking him to \u2018Caravaggio and Velasquez in one\u2019. His ambition to become a history painter gave rise to his most significant work, although he mostly executed portraits. A trip to the Netherlands during the summer of 1786 was greatly influential in bringing him to experience Rubens and Rembrandt first hand. By c.1800 he began painting large-scale genre scenes and was later elected Professsor of Painting at the Royal Academy, having been elected RA in 1787.\n\nThis portrait of a young boy holding fish exemplifies Opie\u2019s skill as a portrait painter, in which he made use of chiaroscuro, the use of clearly defined areas of contrasting tones of light and dark. The influence of Sir Joshua Reynolds (1723-1792) transformed Georgian portraiture through his use of the \u2018Grand manner\u2019, presenting sitters in spectacular settings which reflected noble qualities and drew on poses from Old Masters. His style had a profound impact on portrait painters of the eighteenth-century, such as Thomas Lawrence (1769-1830), and was greatly admired by Opie, who sought to emulate him, most visibly in his lighting and in the free handling of paint in the backgrounds of some of his works. This painting is in the genre of \u2018fancy pictures\u2019, a term invented by Reynolds to describe the portraits of beggars and peasants produced by Thomas Gainsborough at the end of his career.\n\nOpie\u2019s depiction of a young boy of relatively low social status, also undertaken in his Portrait of a Boy Seeking Alms and The Shepherd Boy, can be seen to reflect the late eighteenth and early nineteenth-century\u2019s renewed interest in depictions of low life, exemplified in the work of David Wilkie (1785-1841) and George Morland (1763-1804). Genre painting, portraying most especially the lower classes of society, depicts scenes from everyday life. Set in domestic interiors or in the countryside, they came to be associated with health and pleasure. The seventeenth-century Dutch tradition of genre painting was especially influential during the new vogue which sought to represent a romanticized and vigorous image of rural life. Although not depicting a scene with figures in the way Opie does in The Peasant\u2019s Family  (Tate Britain, London), the present picture reflects this vogue for representations of low-life, whilst combining it with the defined, dramatic lighting of Opie\u2019s society portraits and history paintings, attempting, as it were, to elevate low life into high art.",
