His designs bridged the old world of haute couture and the new mood in fashion that emerged in the late 1950s, and which was moving towards the youthful and paired down lines of the 1960s.  A disciple of Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga (1895-1972), Givenchy was inspired by his architectural approach to fashion.  Givenchy still refers to Balenciaga as 'the master'.\n\nThis evening dress was designed with shoes of matching green silk.",
