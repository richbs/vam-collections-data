Belly with purfling simulated with inlaid silver twisted wire, and with a heart-shaped soundhole and two inwards-facing C-holes with central points. Ivory fingerboard and pegbox, with the finial in the form of a woman's head with plait at back. On the back of the body is written in Indian ink: <i>370 P.R.</i>\n\nWith the instrument is an ivory bow.\n\nThe tubular, tooled and gilt red leather case is decorated in a manner practised in France during the second half of the seventeenth century. The fleur-de-lis gives no indication of date. The crowned L's are associated with Louis XIII and XIV in the seventeenth century, as well as with earlier and later kings of that name. The crowned dolphin which also appears on it, however, was borne only by the Dauphin; and only the Dauphin of the second half of the century was Louis, le Grand Dauphin (1661-1711), the eldest son of Louis XIV. He is more likely to have had use for a pochette during the earlier part of his life, during the third quarter of the century. The hair-style of the lady on the finial also suggests this date. Thus this kit must presumably be a French royal piece. It is also interesting to note that the inlaid stringing of spiral silver wire, seen on the belly of the instrument itself, occurs on some French gun-stocks. The wire for this purpose was normally straight before and after this period but, during the third quarter of the seventeenth century, it was often spiralled.\n\nThe maker, Drouyn, seems to be otherwise unrecorded.\n\nAnthony Baines, <i>Catalogue of Musical Instruments in the Victoria and Albert Museum: Part II: Non-Keyboard Instruments </i>(London, 1978), pp. 20-21.",

They were known as pochettes in France because they could easily be fitted in the coat-pocket of a dancing master, who would play briefly on this instrument, slip it into his pocket and then demonstrate the appropriate steps. Very little music was composed specifically for the kit so the performer generally played violin pieces or popular tunes. \n\nVirtually nothing is known about Dimanche Drouyn, the maker, but he was clearly important enough to supply musical instruments to the household of the Grand Dauphin Louis (1661-1711), the oldest son of  Louis XIV (reigned 1643-1715). This kit was made of ivory, a costly material, and came in a handsome leather case, stamped with a crowned dolphin, the emblem of the heir to the throne of France. The hair-style of the female head crowning the instrument would have been highly fashionable in about 1670.",
