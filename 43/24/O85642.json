The bed has elaborate legs, and is covered  with cushions and hanging draperies.  The Buddha is wrapped in a long sanghati.  Unfortunately the head is missing.  At the foot of  the couch stands the monk Mahakasyapa who touches the Master's foot with his right hand, while his left hand  holds  a pole with a bud-like top, probably a pilgrim's staff.   Behind him we notice a  straight tree.  Three male figures stand erect behind the death bed with arms raised in lamentation.  (Probably Malla princes who later distributed Buddha's relics).",
