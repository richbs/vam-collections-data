            "public_access_description": "The Hamzanama, or 'Book of Hamza' was commissioned by the great Mughal emperor Akbar in the mid-16th century. The epic story of a character based very loosely on the life of the uncle of the Prophet Muhammad chronicles the fantastic adventures of Hamza as he and his band of heroes fight against the enemies of Islam. The stories, from a long-established oral tradition, were written down in Persian, the language of the court, in multiple volumes. These originally had 1400 illustrations, of which fewer than 200 survive today. No independent, contemporary version of the text is known, making it difficult to follow the complicated stories from the residual text preserved on the back of each folio. Work on the volumes probably began in about 1562 and took 15 years to complete.\nHere, Hamza's faithful servant Umar searches for the missing hero, comes across a house in which Hamza and some of his companions have been detained. He gains entrance by disguising himself as a beggar, beats the guards with an ass's leg and rescues them.",
