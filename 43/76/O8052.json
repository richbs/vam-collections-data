Like all of his production other than tiles, it was made  for show rather than for use.  Although De Morgan returned to this image many times and the dish itself was made in Staffordshire, it is a unique work.  He bought the dish in as a blank and it was decorated and then re-fired at his own workshop. The plain, rimless shape was especially suitable for elaborate pictorial decoration such as this.\n\nPeople\nWilliam Frend De Morgan (1839-1917) was a friend of William Morris, and designed stained glass and tiles for Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co.  De Morgan established his own company, experimenting first with stained glass and then  in the 1860s with ceramic production.  He moved workshops from Chelsea to Merton Abbey in Wandsworth, London, and then to nearby Fulham. He spent many years acquiring the expertise to fire lustre glazes in the manner of 14th- and 15th-century ceramics from the Islamic world and Moorish Spain; blue, green and purple were favoured colours, under the same influence.  From around 1907, owing to ill-health and changes in fashionable taste, he gradually ceased production and, over the last ten years of his life, he became a highly successful novelist.",
