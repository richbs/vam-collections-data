The ground in madder and the all-over pattern consists of step-like linked horizontal motifs in pink bordered in red and white diagonal stripes, and yellow bordered in vermilion, surrounding staggered rows of larger pale blue shapes in each of which is a design consisting of the step shapes and floral motifs in white.\n\nThe gown is knee-length with a six button double-breasted fastening, waist seam and flared skirt with a central back inverted pleat flanked by a narrower one running down each of the side bodice seams. There are two diagonal welt pockets at the front. The collar is turn down and fairly narrow, forming lapels when the garment is not fastened up to the neck. There is another button at the neck and at the waist on the left hand side showing that the garment was usually fastened left to right, though the other was equally possible. The buttons are small, round and self covered. The sleeves are long, slightly gathered at the shoulders and have welted cuffs fastening with four small pink composition buttons which may be a replacement. The back is lined with beige ribbon cotton, and the sides faced back with printed cotton.",
