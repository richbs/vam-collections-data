It was designed by John Bates, one of the most innovative and original designers working during the 1960s.\n\nDuring the mid-60s, Bates's designs were at their most modernistic, as this one-off wedding outfit demonstrates.  His mid-60s work often featured bare midriffs, sheer panels, and very short hemlines. Bates introduced plastic garments into high fashion as early as 1962, and was one of the first to design miniskirts. Allen credited him as the creator of the miniskirt, rather than Mary Quant or Courreg\u00e9s. \n\nMarit Allen (1941-2007) was a leading British fashion journalist who started as an assistant at Queen magazine in 1961. In 1964, she joined British Vogue, where she stayed for ten years. Her 'Young Idea' pages were hugely influential. Many young and innovative designers, such as Bates, received their first significant exposure through Allen, who not only gave them magazine coverage, but happily wore their clothes herself.",

She quickly gained control of the \"About 20\" pages of the magazine, in which she showcased young design talent and innovative photography. When Beatrix Miller, the editor of Queen, went to edit Vogue in 1964, she took Marit with her. For ten years, Marit Allen worked as a fashion editor on the magazine. Her \"Young Idea\" pages, written and captioned by herself, showcased innovative young design and fashion, and had a great influence on 60s fashion. Marit Allen was often photographed for her own stories.\n\nJohn Bates was one of Marit's favourite designers and became a close friend of hers. He was chosen to do her wedding dress. Marit championed Bates, and insisted that he was the true creator of the miniskirt, rather than Mary Quant or Courr\u00e8ges. Bates' 60s designs were very adventurous - he bared the midriff, used vinyls - including transparent vinyl - and raised hemlines. His graphic silver and white wedding ensemble encapsulates much of his work in the mid-1960s.",
