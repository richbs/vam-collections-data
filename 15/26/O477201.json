Designs are embroidered onto evenly woven cotton cloth  (khadi, khaddar) usually dyed terracotta red or indigo blue.  Narrow strips of cloth are often joined  together to make the whole piece. Untwisted soft floss silk (heer, pat) is used, mostly yellow and  white, which reflects the light, lending a lustrous appearance to the finished piece. There are different  types of phulkari work.  Some leave parts of the cloth empty as part of the design. Hindu pieces  usually include images of figures and animals; Muslim and Sikh work have geometric designs. In the  type known as bagh ('garden', 'ground'), almost the whole surface of the cloth is covered with  patterns done in surface darning stitch. Double running stitch was used for other  designs, and a variety of additional stitch types added. Phulkari was made for everyday clothes and  especially for ceremonial wear at weddings and festivals. Each type has a special name, such as  Bagh, Chope, Sainchi, Darshan Dar, Vari da Bagh. Shishadar or sheesh bagh incorporates mirror work.",
