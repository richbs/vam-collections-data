According to the artist Ishwari Prasad, his grandfather, Shiva Lal (c.1817-1887), began to make the designs for these  paintings in 1857. They were commissioned by Dr D. R. Lyall (the personal assistant in charge of opium-making)  for a series of wall paintings in the Gulzarbagh factory. However, Lyall was killed in 1857, during the so-called Indian Mutiny, and the scheme was abandoned. This picture shows the opium being mixed in a large, square wooden vat.",
