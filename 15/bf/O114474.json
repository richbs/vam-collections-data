            "public_access_description": "This is an evening ensemble designed by Gerard Pipart for the House of Nina Ricci in 1969. It consists of a full-length dress made of black silk and a knee-length tunic. The dress is sleeveless and has two narrow straps over the shoulders; the bodice is covered with black sequins reaching down to mid-thigh level. The tunic, which is worn over the dress, is composed of a black veil and has long and tight sleeves. The bottom of the tunic is edged in layered black boa feathers. Pipart designed for the House of Nina Ricci from 1964 onwards, and this outfit was personally worn by Nina Ricci (1883-1970) before her death.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, eveningwear underwent huge transformations. Among new concepts for evening dress, fashion designers introduced trouser suits, mini-dresses and ensembles composed of a blouse and a skirt. In addition to sourcing their inspiration from modern architecture and Pop art, designers also turned to exotic influences and many of their designs were based on traditional dress from North Africa, such as the caftan. This ensemble is a typical example of the immense creativity of the late 1960s. It combines the traditional full-length evening dress with a glamorous interpretation of the caftan as a transparent and lavishly decorated mini-dress.",
