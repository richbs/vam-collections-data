The scene is the public execution at the so-called Tyburn Tree, teeming with crowds of people, with men on horseback holding spears along the left hand side.  There are a range of facial expressions on the faces of the people in the foreground, including two young boys laughing and pointing at a man whose legs are submerged in the mud, a man on crutches straining to see above the crowd, a man holding a puppy by its tail and a group of outraged looking fruit sellers in the right foreground.  The central figure, with her back turned on the scene, has a look of horror on her face, clasping a message on a sheet of paper and holding a baby.  There is a cart carrying a coffin alongside women reading bibles, one of whom proselytises to the crowd.  Raked seating flanks the right hand side of the scene close to the unusual triangular structure serving as the famous gallows.  At the top of the scene is lettered the title, with a proverb from the bible inscribed beneath, alongside two hanging skeletons on either side of the picture.",

London: Published by Trustees of the Victoria and Albert Museum, 1987.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n\"William HOGARTH  (1697-1764)\nThe IDLE PRENTICE Executed at Tyburn 1747  (P178, 3rd state)\nPenultimate plate from a set of 12 entitled <i>Industry and Idleness</i>.\nLettered with a quotation from Proverbs, Chapter 1, Verses 27, 28, <i>Plate 11</i> and <i>Design'd &amp; Engrav'd by Wm Hogarth, Publish'd according to Act of Parliament Sept. 30. 1747</i>\nEtching and engraving coloured by hand. \n28 X 42cm\nE.297-1986\nP=Ronald Paulson, <i>Hogarth's Graphic Works</i>, Revised Edition, London 1970.\n\nTwo recurring concerns of William Hogarth were his desire to widen his markets by the exploration of different genres of art (portraiture, conversation pieces, modern moral subjects, popular imagery, history painting etc.) and his efforts to control the publication of his prints, thereby weakening the power of the printsellers and clamping down on illicit copying of his works.  One does not expect to encounter hand-coloured Hogarths.  The print falls into the last of the four categories detailed in the introduction, being one which neither the artist nor the publisher (who are one and the same here) intended should be hand-coloured.\nThe <i>Industry and Idleness</i>set contrasts the fortunes of two apprentices, who starting from the same station in life followed diametrically opposed careers culminating in the execution of one at Tyburn and the elevation of the other to Lord Mayor of London.  Hogarth's advertisement for the set runs 'This Day is publish'd, Price 12s.  Design'd &amp; engraved by Mr HOGARTH, TWELVE Prints, call'd INDUSTRY and IDLENESS...To be had at the Golden Head in Leicester-Fields, and at the Print-Shops.  N.B. There are some printed on a better Paper for the Curious, at 14s. each Set.  To be had only at the Authors in Leicester-Fields.  Where also may be had his other Works.'<sup>1</sup>\nIn these prints, Hogarth was going out to capture his audience who could only afford to but pirated copies of his expensive high society prints such as the Marriage \u00e0 La Mode series.  His advertisement, however shows that his self-interested regard for the status of monochrome printmaking did not allow his pandering to popular taste to run as far as selling his works hand-coloured.  What is so intriguing about his hand-colouring is that its leaden quality, literally so in the blackened areas, seems to indicate colouring from the third quarter of the eighteenth century.  It can only be assumed that this print was coloured when it was resold by someone less scrupulous that Hogarth's original outlets. \n\n<sup>1</sup>Ronald Paulson, Hogarth:<i> His Life, Art and Times</i>, New Haven, 1971 Vol 2, p61.\"",
