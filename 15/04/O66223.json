She is supported by a tree trunk, around which a serpent is twined. \n\nPatrick MacDowell (1799-1870) was an Irish, Belfast born, sculptor, who was initially apprenticed to a London coachbuilder. Later he trained under the sculptor Peter Francis Chenu. He attended the Royal Academy Schools, but already after two years he had a well merited and established reputation as a sculptor. His most important work is probably the memorial to Frederick Richard Chichester, Earl of Belfast (d. 1853) in Belfast Castle, but he is best known for his group depicting Europe for the Albert Memorial in Kensington Gardens.",
