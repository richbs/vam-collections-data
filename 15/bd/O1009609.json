It contains several alterations from the other designs, particularly at the top and bottom. The shape and size of the decoration make it probable that it was intended for the corner panel in the frieze above the bookcases in the Library of the House of Lords however this design was not executed.\n\nAugustus Welby Northmore Pugin (1812-52) is widely considered as one of the most significant and influential architects, designers and theorists of the 19th century. Following his conversion to Catholicism in 1835, he identified the Gothic style with Christian architecture and his work and writings inspired and framed the Gothic Revival. In 'Contrasts', published in 1836, he condemned classical forms and ardently praised 14th and 15th-century architecture. Pugin is best remembered for his work on the Palace of Westminster.",
