He wrote: '\u2026the turnings and windings of the valley, desolate though it was, overlooked by noble mountains wearing their snowy caps, were not wanting in that sterner beauty which is associated with grandeur; and some of my best pictures were obtained in following the course of the river to the glacier at the head of the valley \u2013 a distance of about 50 miles.\u2019",

Groves of walnut trees clustered thick on each bank of the Buspa, which meandered peacefully through the valley; above these, far up the hillsides, flourished the pine and the sturdy deodar \u2013 the whole shut in by lofty mountains, which on the north side often terminated in sharp \u2013pointed peaks, while those on the south were generally covered with verdure and forest.  There was a delightful freshness and beauty about the whole, after the barren and wild scenes through which I had lately passed. I spent three very pleasant days taking views about the valley, and left Sungla with reluctance'.\n\nBourne, S, A Photographic journey through the Higher Himalayas, The British Journal of Photography, March 4 1870, pg 98.",
