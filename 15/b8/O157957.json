His costume has been dated between 1735 and 1745, while the costume of the woman named as Lady Deane's mother (Loan:Gilbert.284-2008) is dated much earlier. One suggestion is that the figure is in fact Lady Deane's husband, Robert Deane.\n\nBefore he became a miniaturist, Gervase Spencer was employed as a gentleman's servant.  He became a successful miniature painter on the newly fashionable base of ivory and later also produced work in enamel.  \n\nContinental artists first introduced enamel painting to England in the 17th century. But it was in the early 18th century that it became fashionable. The young German Christian Friedrich Zincke dominated the market in London. It was Zincke who trained a number of English artists, including William Prewett. Most artists working in enamel were taught by an experienced enameller. It is not known who trained Gervase Spencer this difficult art, but he later taught Henry Spicer, who in turn taught William Birch. In 1794 Birch successfully established himself in America as an enamel painter.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
