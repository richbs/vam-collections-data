Only two prototypes were ever made and these were displayed in the Museum of Modern Art.  A modern polypropylene version is now available for the first time making it more widely accessible for those it was originally intended for; children. Charles and Ray Eames were fascinated with by elephants and spent time on trips to India and at circus to research them.\n\nThis object was acquired for the 2010 exhibition 'Sit down: Seating for Kids' to show as an example of seats that are made to be played with, and also as an example of how animal shapes are a common inspiration for designers of children's products.
