His mature interests were in the fields of hydrostatics and hydraulics, and he is credited with fundamental work on the theory and construction of pump and water engines. He is said to have invented the drum capstan for weighing anchor at sea, the speaking trumpet and two sorts of arithmetical calculating machines. He was a cryptographer and an architect of military fortifications. He first came to general notice as a controversialist in the Protestant evangelical interest, with his history of the Waldensian sect in southern France and Piedmont. This was published in 1658 and was prefaced by an engraved portrait of Morland by P Lombart after Lely. The latter remains the principal evidence for Morland's appearance, and at 1658 must be close in date to the present miniature. Although certainly not the same image, the likenesses are quite compatible, and the comparison supports the traditional identification of the Cooper miniature as Morland. A miniature in the Buccleuch Collection (1) was formerly thought to be of Morland. \n\nThe attribution has never been in question. In Cooper's oeuvre the portrait relates most closely to the <i>James, Duke of York</i> (Cat. No. 85); the pose and viewpoint are similar, and the handling, which is bright and lively, over an exceptionally rich carnation ground, is characteristic of Cooper's Restoration style. The <i>James</i> is the first official likeness in miniature of the Duke after the Restoration (it is dated 1661; see also Cat. No. 82), and the probability is that the Morland was painted at much the same time, perhaps to mark the sitter's baronetcy and appointment to the Privy Chamber in July 1660. \n\n1 See the exceptionally full biography in the <i>DNB</i>.\n2 BB4; see Kennedy 1917, p. 37, 'artist unknown'.\u201d \n",
