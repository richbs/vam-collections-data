It appears to have been assembled from fabric previously used for something else. There is an ogival lattice with a circle of spiralling metal thread at the junctions.  The compartments contain a stylised floral sprig with a pair of pink leaves, 2 shoots with lots of round buds and a large central motif without any detail but with 3 round buds on  top.  The two patches show the top of this motif with the three buds.\nThere is a bias-cut border with a metal thread ground which is created by a weft of silver strip open S-wound on a yellow silk core; pink silk warp and twill binding. The pattern is rows of a right facing boteh, off-set.  Each boteh is filled with small flower heads in red, blue, white and black held within a band decorated with faint flower heads in red and blue, with an outline of small green buds. The is a pair of leaves at the base and an ornamental motif [a vase?] immediately below.  In between the botehs there are large and small floral sprigs.\nEmbroidery Threads: 2S-plied silk: pink and light pink.\nMetal thread: gilt strip open S-wound around a light yellow silk core couched with pink silk.\nBacking: plain weave light brown cotton. \nFacing: narrow stripes of green, red, yellow and black and blue and red and white chevrons.  The green appears to be silk.",
