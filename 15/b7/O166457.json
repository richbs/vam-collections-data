In doing so, he laid the foundations of modern photography. Calvert Richard Jones learned of these developments in 1839 through a neighbour, who was a cousin of Talbot. Jones made many pictures in the West of England and South Wales, where he lived. He also travelled widely, making photographs on the continent. Jones' work stands out in the early development of photography because he was one of the first to apply a schooled artist's eye to the medium.\n\nThis formal portrait of Talbot was photographed against a plain draped background cloth with a carved pedestal table and chair. It is an unusual arrangement for Jones, whose portraits and groups are normally posed in context, often in doorways or against buildings. It is an artificially composed interior scene, set up outside and lit with sunlight. The three-quarter view of Talbot's face, a small triangle of white shirt and study of his hands, one on a book and the other resting on the table by the vase, are brightly lit elements in a dark image.",
