Cut across the top. There are three borders along the bottom: the central one has a green ground with a spray of 3 white flowers pointing to the upper right alternating with a spray of a pink and red and 2 buds pointing to the lower right.  Above and below is a border with a zigzag of white diagonal blocks [leaves?] between two lines of red and dark blue diamonds.  These 3 borders are edged with small white motifs which could be tiny flowers.\n\nThe main pattern is a series of diagonal lines from lower right to upper left.  These are chevron lines in orange and white either side of a line of red or blue geometric motifs.\n\nThere are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: white ground with a horizontal striped stem pointing to the right with a red flower bending slightly to the lower right alternating with a large U-shaped blossom.\n[2] wider stripes in two designs: [a] red and white striped vase surrounded by white blossoms and a pair of orange and blue flowers extending into a red blossom with 3 pale blossoms at the top alternating with a small blue triangular base, pair of orange leaves outlined in blue, a diamond arrangement of white flowers and ending with a large pointed white blossoms between 2 red ones.\n[b] a group of 3 octagonal pink flowers with red centre alternating with a mass of small white 4-petalled flowers.\n\nThreads: silk; 2S; red, pink, white, blue, orange, light blue, green, dark greed. There may be others but I cannot see the back because of the backing.",
