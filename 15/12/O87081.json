The act was billed as \u2018Kelly and Gilette in the sketch \u201cFun in a Billiard Room\u201d\u2019. This is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian performers drawn by the graphic artist George Cooke and compiled in a series of albums. Woody Kelly is listed as a trampoline artist in a list of the performers in this collection. Although there is little to suggest this from the image, he may well be standing at a bar in the billiard room. Kelly was certainly not a top-billing star on the halls, but trampoline was a circus act by the late 19th century and it sometimes featured as an item in early 20th-century music hall.\n\nThe caricature comes from the second album of caricatures compiled by Cooke in a collection of albums owned by the V&A Theatre Collections. The artist labelled it \u2018Geo Cooke HYS BOOKE\u2019. It features music hall performers working in the 1900s.",

There is little to suggest from this image that Kelly was a trampoline artist and he was certainly not a top-billing star, but trampoline was a circus act by the late 19th century and certainly featured as an item in early 20th century music hall entertainment.The caricature comes from the second album of caricatures in a collection of albums owned by the Theatre Museum compiled by the graphic artist George Cooke.  It is labelled by the artist 'Geo Cooke HYS BOOKE' and features music hall performers working in the early 20th century.",
