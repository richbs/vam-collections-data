This watery scene is appropriate for a ewer and basin, relating as it does to the ewer's function of pouring water.\n\nSources of Design\nThe decoration on the ewer reflects the Renaissance and highly sophisticated, Mannerist styles that were current on the Continent. They were spread throughout Europe primarily by means of engravings. By the mid-16th century goldsmiths in England had access to many such sources, as is clear from the  new and fantastical decoration on their work.\n\nThe crouching lion on the upper part of the handle of this ewer is based on a print of 1531 by the Italian engraver Agostino Veneziano. (This is also displayed in the British Galleries. See museum no. 16842.) Prints of ancient Roman vases were especially influential in promoting classical ornament. Although the designs comprise a mixture of modern and antique motifs, many were inscribed in Latin to exaggerate the supposed antiquity of the vases.  The series of printed vases made in Rome were often aimed at the tourist or foreign markets.",
