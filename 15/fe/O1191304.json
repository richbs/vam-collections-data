Their names, Daphne and Adrian, have been written on the underside of each chair, one on each, as both were originally the same colour scheme as this one. The set originally included a plain table, which had not survived storage when the chairs were in use once again in the late 1960s, by the donor's children. \n\nThe furniture was a Christmas gift to Daphne and Adrian from their grandparents, with whom they spent a great deal of time. The grandfather was a baker in Southend on Sea, and was head of the local Chamber of Commerce. The chairs' style is unusual for the time, more closely resembling shop fittings than children's furniture. It seems likely that these chairs were commissioned from a local trades person, through the grandfather's business links.",
