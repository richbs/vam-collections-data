A double circle surrounds the complex central lake scene representing a pagoda, rock formations with trees and a perched bird, a fishing boat with sail, a pleasure barge and small figures. Both vessels are half-moon shaped in the Persian version. The half-circle motif above the prow of the barge imitates a reed hut. The wide omega-shape at the top reproduces Chinese hills creating depth. The outer flange is decorated with two sets of tufts of grass, two butterflies, two Y-shaped rocks as dividers and four small vegetable clusters.",

Echoes of earlier traditions remained, in particular in the black-under-turquoise colour scheme that dates back in Iran to the end of the 12th century. Towards the end of the 16th century there was a widening of interest that blossomed in the 17th century to a wide range of styles and techniques in which blue and white plays a dominant but not exclusive role.",
