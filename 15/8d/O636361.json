This print by Henri Bonnart, an artist renowned for prints showing fashions, shows Philippe, Duc d\u2019Orleans, the brother of Louis XIV. It is from a series of prints showing figures from the French Court. \n\nMonsieur wears a heavily brocaded waistcoat, under a long coat, with tight stockings - typical of those worn formally and for court. His costume shows other marks of a fashionable courtier include the high peaked wig worn over his shoulders and front, a sword and a cane and heeled shoes with expensive buckles. Gentlemen wore heeled shoes, rather than boots, with lace or buckles. The court of Louis XIV is believed to have originated the wearing of red soled shoes, now a feature of shoes made by Laboutin.   \n\nThe court of Louis XIV was extremely opulent and courtiers were expected to dress to reflect their position. The court of the Sun King was characterised by [excessive] protocol governing behavior, etiquette, precedence and dress \u2013 a policy used by Louis XIV to control and distract his court. He hoped his courtiers\u2019 time and resources were spent on impressing him rather than plotting rebellion. A high-ranking courtier would need a large and expensive wardrobe because rules for clothing, as well as behaviour, were carefully stratified so that only those of higher rank could wear certain fabrics or styles.  \n\nAn English commentator, the Rev John Andrews, noted in 1770 that French court dress is \u2018a piece of state policy to prevent their employing their intellectual faculties\u2019 . Such elaborate fashions were rare in England where high society was less centred around the court.",
