Set in early 16th century Jutland, the story centred on Hilda, who lives in the mountain with the witch Muri and her trolls.  \nAs the story was devised by Bournonville from Thiele's Popular Legends, the figures on the sheet represent characters in the ballet and are a testimony to the popular success of the work.  Bournonville regarded the ballet as his most successful work, because of its Danish atmosphere and the mix of humour and seriousness and range of dances.  Both the ballet and the music were still popular a hundred years later.",
