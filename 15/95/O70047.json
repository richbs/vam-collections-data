He holds a closed book in his left hand and a staff in his right. A purse with three tassels hangs at his left side below his cloak. He is bare-footed. He wears a robe ornamented at the bottom with two whelk shells, and a cloak draped over his shoulders.\n\nA bad horizontal break across the middle of the panel has been repaired and part of the carving restored. The saint's hat, book and staff have been damaged, and his right hand is missing. The top corners of the panel are missing.\n\nThere are traces of gilding on the saint's robe and on his hair and beard. There is some red on the folds of his cloak. The strap of his hat is painted green; the hat itself is green and brown. There are traces of the usual green ground with the daisy pattern at the bottom of the panel. The panel has been completely backed with plaster.",
