His interest in railways led to his election as an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1839, and he was director or chairman of two railway companies between 1843 and 1848.  Much of his time however was spent collecting pictures and works of art.  In his will he offered his collection of mostly German and Dutch schools to the National Gallery (which selected only three works) and to the Department of Science and Art at South Kensington, later the Victoria and Albert Museum.  The South Kensington Museum acquired ninety-two oil paintings and forty-seven watercolours.  A number of engravings were also left to the British Museum.",

            "historical_context_note": "This painting of Dutch men-of-war ships in a storm, was acquired in 1870 as by Ludolf Bakhuizen (died 1708) but was re-attributed to Dominic Serres in 1918 after the discovery of his signature and the date, 1770, on a floating spar in the left corner. At the time <i>The Connoisseur</i> observed, \u2018\u2026 that his venture in the style of Bakhuizen has passed muster all these years as an original by this Dutch master is sufficient testimonial to his skilful imitation\u2019 (<i>The Connoisseur</i>, 1918, p.234). In connection with this painting, it is also interesting to note that Serres exhibited two pictures in the style of the Van de Veldes at the Royal Academy, London, in 1786.\n\nSerres was pre-eminent among marine painters, his works praised for their accurate portrayal of nautical detail. He was the only marine painter among the 36 founder members of the Royal Academy of Art, exhibiting 105 paintings there between 1769-93 and was appointed Marine Painter to George III.",
