He was billed as \u2018The Man who Tamed Electricity! The Human Resistance Coil! The Modern Miracle Worker! Hypnotist! Electrician! Scientist! Performs the Feat of Passing over 10,000 Volts of Electricity Through his Body! The Sensation of the Century! Doctor Amazed! Scientists Puzzled!\u2019. It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke and compiled in a series of albums.\n\nCooke described Hermann as a hypnotist, but on his posters Hermann advertised himself as \u2018The Man Who Tamed Electricity\u2019. A review of his performance reveals that a highlight of his act was performing \u2018shock treatment\u2019 on audience members with paralysis. Hermann was already a celebrity in the world of magic by February 1900, when a portrait of him was published in the magazine Ally Sloper\u2019s Half Holiday.",
