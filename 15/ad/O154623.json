When he was commissioned to design King Lear for the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre Company in 1955, he had little experience of costume.  \n\nThe style that Noguci chose to present his ideas is unusual.  Instead of the usual 2-D figure on paper, he produced little paper dolls, with layers of costumes that could be removed; fixed to each figure was a wire strut so that it could stand upright.\n  \nThis design is for Oswald, steward to Goneril.  The actual information conveyed by the designs is not easy for a costume-maker to interpret.  The use of paper reduces everything to a flat plane, so there is no indication of weight or thickness of materials, save the lines on the hipband which indicate a rounded, padded shape - like a tyre.",

The play was directed by George Devine, with John Gielgud as Lear. The production opened in Brighton on 6 June, then visited festivals in Vienna, Zurich, The Hague, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Berlin and Copenhagen, before playing at London's Palace Theatre, 21 July to 17 September. It then went to Hanover, Bremen, Hamburg, Oslo, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool, and finally came to the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre at Stratford-upon-Avon, 29 November to 17 December.\n\nThe costumes were made by Carl Bonn and Colin Mackenzie.\n\nHistorical significance: This is a most unusual way of presenting a costume design and there is nothing else quite like it in the Museum collections.",
