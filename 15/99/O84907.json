When the museum acquired the original jar in 1876, curators were concerned that it might be a forgery. The museum records note that \"Mr Casper Clarke lately returned from Persia says that about a dozen jars of this design were made in Persia about 30 years ago for a French gentleman\". Casper Purdon-Clarke, a former director of the V&A, had even met the man who made the moulds in which the jars were produced, so the Museum's suspicions were understandable.\n\nWhen this similar but smaller jar came into the Museum in 1884 the curators were more confident that it was genuine, because it was part of the famous Castellani collection. However, it turned out that the first jar was the genuine one, made between 1150 and 1220, and this one was a copy made some time between 1840 and 1875.",
