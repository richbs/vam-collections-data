            "public_access_description": "The most important French porcelain factory was founded in 1740 in the royal chateau of Vincennes. In 1756 it was transferred to S\u00e8vres, the other side of Paris, and shortly after was bought by Louis XV. The support and protection of the king and his mistress, Madame de Pompadour, enabled it to secure the best artists, sculptors, designers and chemists. S\u00e8vres porcelain soon became the most sought after in Europe. \nThe royal manufactory at S\u00e8vres specialised in luxury porcelains, many of which were destined for the French court. Each year it displayed its newest models in the king's apartments at Versailles. The factory was very responsive to changes in fashion and introduced many innovations in design and decoration. Its products were admired throughout Europe and its style was widely imitated. During the French Revolution, which brought about a disastrous drop in sales of luxury porcelain, the factory was nationalised and began producing patriotic wares such as this saucer.\nIn the centre of the saucer a triangular stonemason's or carpenter's level representing Equality and Justice is surrounded by radiating light representing Truth and Knowledge. The central border is painted with myosotis flowers (forget-me-nots) and the outer border with orange nasturtiums (capucine). Laurel wreaths representing Victory enclose three symbols: Fasces (a bundle of bound rods, here with a spearhead, not an axe) the symbol of ancient Roman Power and Jurisdiction, a watering can (Arrosoir) for the10th day of the French Republican Calendar period of  Thermidor (19 July \u2013 17 August) and a harvesting basket (Hotte) for the 20th day of Fructidor (18 August \u2013 16  September).\nIt is possible that this saucer was commissioned as part of a set to celebrate not only the French Revolutionary ideals, but also dates of significance to the owner.",

Several other departments were also beneficiaries of his generosity.\n\nBorn in 1836, Joseph Henry Fitzhenry was a prodigious art collector and dealer. He was a friend of the art collectors Sir Richard Wallace, George Salting and J. Pierpont Morgan, to the latter of whom he provided advice on purchases. According to his obituarist, 'Nothing is certainly known about Mr. Fitzhenry\u2019s origin or early life'. Fitzhenry was a founding member of the V&A\u2019s Advisory Council, attending only one meeting before he died in London on 15 March 1913, aged 77. He was buried in Brompton cemetery.",
