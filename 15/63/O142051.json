It would have been displayed, along with additional luxury items on a dressing table in an elegantly furnished boudoir.\nIt is not known who the makers of such services were as they rarely marked their work in any way. They were usually commissioned and put together by a marchand mercier. A complete set is depicted in the celebrated signboard painted by Antoine Watteau about 1721, for the art dealer Gersaint. (L\u2019Enseigne de  Gersaint).  The graphic source for the imaginary pictorial scene on the lid has not been traced but it may represent Vertumnus and Pomona , a subject described in Ovid\u2019s Metamorphosis where the Roman god Vertumnus, disguised as an old woman, attempts to seduce the wood nymph Pomona by relating a parable of marriage. Only when he revealed himself as a young and beautiful god did Pomona fall in love with him and agree to marry him. A scene such as this would have been appropriate for a toilet service supplied or commissioned as a betrothal or wedding gift",

Such wig boxes would have been supplied with additional matching powder boxes. The interior of this example is possibly too shallow for use as a wig box but is likely to have been supplied as part of a toilet service.",
