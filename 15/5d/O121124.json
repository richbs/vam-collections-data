It was made in 1913 to hang outside the Omega Workshops, located at 33 Fitzroy Square, West London.  \n\nThe Omega Workshop was launched by the art historian, critic and painter Roger Eliot Fry (1866-1934).  It was a venture set up with the hope that the new sense of colour, design and rhythm animating post-impressionism would be taken up in the decorative arts.  Despite the involvement of artists such as Fry, Grant, Vanessa Bell (1879-1961) and, initially, Wyndham Lewis (1882-1957) and Henri Gaudier-Brzeska (1891-1915), the company had difficulty surviving and closed in 1919.",
