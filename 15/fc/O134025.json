As a boy, drew plants for his father's engravings for Loddiges's monthly <i>The Botanical Cabinet</i> (1817-33). Also made preliminary drawings for his father's <i>London and its Vicinity</i> (1820-34) which were used by illustrators such as Stanfield, Prout, Cotman and Callcott, and worked on John Loudon's <i>Encyclopaedia of Plants</i> (1829). Etched his own illustrations for <i>Shipping and Craft</i> (1828-9) and with his father for Views of the Old and the New London Bridges (1833). Evidently made preliminary drawings for Stanfield. Painted in watercolours until 1834, when, after one lesson with James Stark, a family friend, he was inspired to paint in oils. Exhibited mostly marine and coastal subjects; 130 at the RA between 1835 and 1879,115 at the HI 1835-67, and three at the SBA 1835, 1838, 1876. Elected ARA 1851, RA 1863. Travelled extensively in Britain and abroad, most frequently in France from 1833, Holland from 1837, and Venice from 1850; also Italy 1845-6, Spain 1860-61, Egypt 1874. His inherited interest in natural history led to membership of several learned societies, notably FRS 1863, and his publication of <i>Grotesque Animals</i> (1872). Also published <i>Landscapes British and Foreign</i> (1874) and <i>Leaves from my Sketchbooks</i> (1876, 1877). Died Groombridge, Kent, 4 January 1880; his studio sales were at Christie's 22 May 1880 and 11 March 1882. \n\nLIT: Edited transcript of the artist's MS Diary, National Maritime Museum; MS Ledger of paintings completed 1829-78 (referred to below as <i>Ledger</i>), RA Library;<i>Illustrated London News</i> 13 August 1864, pp 173-4 (with engr portrait); <i>Art Journal</i> 1869, pp253-5; J Munday 'E W Cooke, Marine Painter' <i>Mariner's Mirror</i> (Society for Nautical Research) 1967, vol 53, pp99-113); <i>Edward William Cooke</i> Guildhall Art Gallery exhibition catalogue 1970, information also kindly supplied by John Munday\n\n<b>Brighton Sands</b> \nFA41 Neg GAl191 \nCanvas, 54.6 x 76.2 cm (21\u00bd x 30 ins) \nSigned and dated 'E W Cooke 1837' \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nIn the <i>Ledger</i> as 'Hogg-boat [that is, a Hag-boat: for definition, see OED] on the beach at Brighton', painted at Redleaf, finished July 1837, and bought by Sheepshanks for 50 guineas. The diary however records him beginning the painting in August. Exhibited at the BI in 1838, the size given in the catalogue as '32 by 41 inches'. A watercolour sketch is in the V&A collections, also from the Sheepshanks Gift (FA15); it is signed and dated April 1835, and was presumably made during his stay at Hastings (see FA46, p43) along the Sussex coast in the same month. There is a chalk sketch for the painting on the back of 'Mont St Michel, Normandy', (FA43, p42). \n\nWaagen wrote that it is 'very picturesquely conceived and carefully executed in a warm, true, and clear tone ... resembles a Van de Capelle in effect'; the composition and treatment are certainly reminiscent of Dutch 17th-century marine painting. \n\nEXH: BI 1838 (68); <i>Victorian Painting</i> Mitsukoshi Gallery, Tokyo, 1967; <i>Edward William Cooke</i> Guildhall Art Gallery 1970 (20)\n \nLIT: G Waagen <i>Treasures of Art in Great Britain</i> II, p305\"",
