It might be that this bust is one or other of these women.\nBehnes was the son of a Hanoverian pianoforte maker living in London. Behnes commenced studies at the Royal Academy. He probably began work as an independent sculptor around 1819. He was very successful and well respected for the execution of his busts. Behnes exhibited constantly at the Royal Academy between 1815 and 1863, but died almost destitute, having been declared bankrupt in 1861.",
