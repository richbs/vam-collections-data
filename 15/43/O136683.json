The earliest datable figures appear to be ones of Queen Victoria. Few flatbacks were produced after 1905, but in their heyday in the late 19th century they were produced in vast numbers, usually modelled after prints. They represented a wide variety of subjects but those of actors and actresses were especially popular.\n\nMazeppa was an spectular drama, based on a poem by Lord Byron. The play acquired some notoriety when American actress and equestrienne, Adah Isaacs Menken (1835-1868) appeared as the Tartar prince, Mazeppa, at Astley's Amphitheatre in 1864. Tied to the back of a galloping horse, and dressed in a brief tunic and flesh-coloured body tights, Menken was a sensation. The ceramic figure represents her in a blue tunic but Menken's stage costume was intended to suggest nudity, and her apparently nakedness made the play both a shock and a great success.",

When the affair is discovered, the outraged husband has the young man tied to the back of a wild horse which is set loose, the intent being to kill him.  He survives, of course, and Romantic artists and performers picked it up from there, the most notable being the American Adah Isaacs Menken.\n\nBorn in New Orleans in 1835 and dead by 1868, Menken managed to scandalize America with her Lady Godiva-like stage performances in <i>Mazeppa</i>, her multiple marriages (four in seven years), her short cropped hair and her cigarettes.  She converted to Judaism with her short-lived first marriage and remained committed to it throughout her life.  \n\nIn the 1860s she took <i>Mazeppa</i> to Paris and London (and was there feted by Dumas p\u00e9re, Rossetti, Swinburne, Dickens and others).  She died unnoticed in Paris at the age of 33 and was buried in a cemetery in Montparnasse. It has been said that <i>Mazeppa</i> remained the most widely performed drama in the American West from the 1860s until the end of the century.\n\nByron's poem had captured the imagination of French painters: Gericault in 1823 and Delacroix in 1824, both of whom presumably identified with Mazeppa, and, perhaps most famously, Emile Jean Horace Vernet, who all painted images of the hapless Mazeppa tied to the horse.",
