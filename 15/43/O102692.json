From the yoke hang long pointed loose panels, one to the back, one to the front; below the waist, these panels are caught across at the sides; all the panel points are weighted with looped strings of tiny beads ending in pale pink drop pearls.  The seams are accented with very narrow pink satin ribbon.  The coatee fastens at the front yoke with hooks and eyes.",
