            "public_access_description": "The designer Kaffe Fassett used a variety of textured yarns in muted colours to create this magnificent coat. It was hand-knitted by Zoe Hunt. Predominantly worked in stocking stitch, it reveals Fassett\u2019s unorthodox, creative and highly influential approach to design. The shaping of this ankle-length garment with full sleeves draws upon Renaissance and Eastern dress. \n\nKaffe Fassett was born in San Francisco and came to live in England in 1964. An art student, he did not begin knitting until his late twenties.  His early commercial collections were commissioned by Missoni and Bill Gibb. \n\nFassett typically uses geometric patterns in a rich palette of different hues. He summed up his philosophy of colour in an interview in Vogue Knitting International in 2002: 'Why limit yourself to just one shade of red when you can use 17?'",
