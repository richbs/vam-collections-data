It was formerly ascribed to Francesco Bertos and Venice.\nThe Rape of the Sabines is a legend in the early history of Rome. According to that Romulus, the founder of the city, used a trick to secure the future population of Rome. He organised a festival where the neighbouring inhabitants were invited, including the Sabines along with their wives and children. At a certain signal Rome's young men went into the crowd and carried away the unmarried wives. Plutarch has described to this legend the origin of the custom of lifting up a bride and carrying her over the doorstep of her husband's house.",
