The clasp is made from three stylised tulips of open filigree, with a large vertical tulip in the centre, and a smaller horizontal tulip on each side.  The piece on the right, facing the clasp, is soldered to the central piece, and the piece on the left is attached by a pin fastening.  The pin is joined to the clasp by five graduated chains of figure-of-eight links, which hang across the front of the clasp from a ring at the top of the right-hand piece when the pin is in place.  The filigree is decorated with applied domes covered with twisted wire rings, and red, blue and green pastes in closed settings.  There are vertical bars on the back to attach the clasp to a belt.",

These clasps come in a small number of basic shapes.  This one is shaped like stylised tulips, a favourite Ottoman motif.  It was worn with the pointed part facing upwards, and was fastened by a pin, which attached the left-hand piece to the rest of the clasp.  The five chains, which join the pin to the clasp, hung down decoratively over the front of the clasp when it was fastened.  Tulip-shaped filigree clasps were also worn in some of the other Greek islands, and on the west coast of the Balkans, but those are usually smaller and less decorative than Cypriot clasps.\n\nCypriot clasps are part of the general Ottoman tradition, but are often more sophisticated and decorative than those from elsewhere.  The goldsmiths of Cyprus were famous for their filigree although they rarely marked their work.  This clasp was bought in 1888, just after a terrible famine, when many people had to sell their family heirlooms to survive.",
