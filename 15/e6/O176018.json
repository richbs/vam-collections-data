These earrings themselves were probably made later, in imitation of the earlier aristocratic jewellery.  \n\nThey were bought for the V&A as an example of traditional jewellery from Lower Normandy.  Earrings were not part of traditional dress in Normandy, but when they became fashionable in the 19th century, Normandy women wore them in the same way as every other woman in France.  These earrings are not characteristic of the kind usually worn in Normandy.  They were probably imported from southern Italy, where the mix of yellow gold filigree with red gold geometric plaques is very common.\n\nThey were bought for 17 shillings and six pence (the pair) at the International Exhibition in London in 1872.",
