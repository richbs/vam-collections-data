            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of British Oil Paintings 1820-1860</i>, Ronald Parkinson, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1990, pp. 161-62\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"My Uncle Toby and the Widow Wadman\nFAl13\nNeg 51948\nCanvas, 82.5 X 57.1 cm (32\u00bd X 22\u00bd ins)\nSheepshanks Gift 1857\n\nOne of the artist's most celebrated and popular paintings, Taylor (Leslie II, p212) records three versions of the composition: the first, the present work, painted for John Sheepshanks, and replicas for Robert Vernon, and then, in 1842, for Jacob Bell. In 1860 all three were in the National Collection at South Kensington; the later two are now in the Tate Gallery. There are differences in detail; the most notable difference in composition is that in the Vernon picture the map of Dunkirk on the wall is lowered behind the two heads. Either the present work or the Vernon painting was exhibited at the RA in 1831, although the 1907 catalogue for some reason dates the present work to 1832. Taylor (Leslie II, p207) records Leslie working on the present picture in 1830, and the existence of an earlier watercolour (see below) indicates work in the later 1820s.\n \nThe title given in the RA catalogue was 'A Scene from Tristam [sic] Shandy' with the following quotation: \n\n'1 protest, Madam,' said my uncle Toby, '1 can see nothing whatever in your eye'. \n'It is not in the white,' said Mrs Wadman. My uncle Toby looked with might and main into the pupil. \n\nThe lines are from Laurence Sterne's novel <i>The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman</i> first published 1760-9; the last volume mainly deals with the courtship of Toby and the widow. It was one of Taylor's favourite books. \n\nThe <i>Athenaeum</i> found the work 'a delightful scene indeed . . . the colouring is extremely good'. In 1834, <i>Arnold's Magazine of the Fine Arts</i> noted: \n\nExquisite drawing, fine perception of female beauty, and quaint and quiet humour ... The unsophisticated simplicity of Uncle Toby, the earnestness of his gaze ... and the [widow's] assumed innocence, and the fascinating <i>na\u00efvet\u00e9</i>, are most graphically portrayed, and may be considered as fully equalling the humour and richness of Sterne himself. It is altogether a faultless work, a real gem of Art, and for the excellencies pointd out, cannot be equalled by any of the old masters. For it is questionable that if anyone of the Flemish painters had treated of such a subject, but it would have been disfigured by some gross conceit or other; whereas such a blemish can never in the remotest degree be attached to any one work of Leslie's ... \n\nThe <i>Art Journal</i> in 1856 found the widow in the present work 'more refined in character' than in the Vernon picture, and in 1857 in a review of the Sheepshanks collection thought the sentiment of the whole 'less refined, and partakes little of the playful and sparkling manner which prevails in later works'. \n\nThe <i>Art Journal</i> in 1869 recorded that the artist Charles Catton RA (1728-98) had given Leslie the idea for the subject through his illustrations to <i>Tristram Shandy</i>. Tavlor records that the model for Uncle Toby was the actor John (Jack) Bannister (1760-1836), a friend of Leslie; he is described as 'remarkably handsome, even as an old man; his dark eyes, still full of animation', and 'one of the pleasantest of actors, most genial of companions and kindest of men ... it would be hard to find a better model for him'. The resemblance is indubitable; compare for example the profile portrait by John Varley of about 1816, drawn with a graphic telescope (an early form of camera lucida), in the V&A collections. (For a full iconography of Bannister, see R Walker <i>Regency Portraits</i> 1985, I, pp21-3. Interestingly, Bannister had played a character called Uncle Tobv in the play <i>The Devil in the Wine Cellar</i>.)\n\nA watercolour version (26.7 X 19.1 cm / 10\u00bd x 7\u00bd ins) was in the Haldimand collection, apparently formed between 1826 and 1828 (sold Christie's 21 June 1861 and 18 March 1980). A copy in a private collection is recorded in the Departmental files in 1922.\n\nThe widespread fame of Leslie's image is demonstrated by the fact that it was reproduced as a polychrome transfer print on the lid of pots of bear's grease manufactured by F & R Pault & Co Ltd. \n\nEXH: ?RA 1831 (238); <i>Exposition Universelle</i> Paris 1855 (869, lent by Sheepshanks) \n\nENGR: \tM J Danforth 1833 as 'The Sentry Box' (impr in V&A collections); (the Vemon version) L Stocks (impr in British Museum) \n\nLIT: <i>Athenaeum</i> 21 May 1831, p331; <i>Arnold's Magazine of the Fine Arts</i> III, 1834, p546; <i>Art Journal</i> 1856, p74, 1857, p240; <i>Athenaeum</i> 1857, p857; <i>Leslie</i> I, pplviii-lx, II, pp207, 212; <i>Art Journal</i> 1869, p28; <i>A Gallery of British Art</i> 1873, p76 (repr): <i>L'Artiste</i> 1884 (xx), p260; <i>English Art in the Public Galleries of London</i> II, nd [1888], p140; A Dayot <i>La Peinture Anglaise</i> 1908, pl09; FP Brown <i>London Paintings</i> 1933, p101 (repr as by Maclise); O Aubrat <i>La Peinture de Genre en Angleterre</i> ... nd [1934], repr pl xviii\"\n<u>100 Great Paintings in The Victoria & Albert Museum.</u> London: V&A, 1985, p.136\nThe following is the full text of the entry, incorporating corrections to quotations from Sterne's novel (Chapter 4.XLVIII & XLIX):\n\n\"Charles Robert Leslie RA 1794-1859\n<i>British School</i> \nMY UNCLE TOBY AND THE WIDOW WADMAN from Lawrence Sterne, TRISTRAM SHANDY, Book viii, Chapters 24, 25 \nOil on canvas, 81 X 56 cm \nFA.113. <i>Sheepshanks Gift</i>  \n\nLawrence Sterne's (1713-1768), comic masterpiece <i>Tristram Shandy</i> was instantly successful when it was first published in 1760, and has ever since been acclaimed for its sardonic portrayal of the comedy of human life. \n\nThe incident depicted in Sterne's novel shows the old soldier Captain Shandy, normally happily occupied in re-enacting the battle of Malplaquet in the peace of his back garden, under siege from the amorous Widow Wadman: \n\n\"--I am half distracted, captain Shandy, said Mrs. Wadman, holding up her cambrick handkerchief to her left eye, as she approach'd the door of my uncle Toby's sentry-box--a mote--or sand--or something--I know not what, has got into this eye of mine--do look into it--it is not in the white-- In saying which, Mrs Wadman edged herself close in beside my Uncle Toby [...] Do look into it, said she. [...] I protest, Madam, said my Uncle Toby, I can see nothing whatever in your eye.\"\n\nLeslie excelled at literary subjects of this type, much in vogue in the early 19th century. This was his most famous composition, which he repeated several times, the first version of it being shown at the Royal Academy in 1831. The light comic actor John Bannister was the model for Uncle Toby. \nThe picture became for the Victorian public an instantly recognisable symbol of flirtatiousness, and in the 1860s became extremely well known as an advertising image. It was reproduced as a polychrome transfer print on the lids of pots, issued by F and R Pratt, containing Russian Bear's Grease (gentlemen's hair dressing) and it is not too fanciful to imagine a Victorian 'Widow Wadman' giving such a pot to her 'Uncle Toby' during their courtship.\n\nLionel Lambourne\"",
