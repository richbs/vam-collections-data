On the other side are twenty-three single and double courses, hitched to a single rail.'

It is fitted with metal strings on both sides and was widely used in Germany and the Netherlands from about 1650 to 1750. The player would place it on a table, pluck the melody with his right hand and strum the accompaniment with his left, producing a cross between the sound of a harpsichord and a harp. This example was probably made in the Netherlands, and one of the soundboards is decorated with floral motifs, in much the same way as harpsichord soundboards, made in Northern Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries.",
