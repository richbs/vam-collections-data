Murphy RDI (1884-1939) who had been teaching on a part time basis at the Central since 1912, later becoming Head of the Silversmithing Department in 1932 and ultimately Principal of the School in 1936.  Murphy was one of the most important and progressive silversmiths between the two world wars. He had worked briefly and unhappily for Emil Lettr\u00e9, an established German silversmith and jeweller in Berlin in 1912.  This experience and an enquiring mind made Murphy aware of emerging Modernism, particularly in respect to German modern design and it was he along with a few others, most notably Harold Stabler, who were responsible for introducing modernistic values into English contemporary silver and jewellery. \n\nMurphy was a gifted and dedicated teacher and as well as running his own workshop, taught silversmithing and jewellery throughout his career, at first at the Royal College of Art and then at the Central School.  Family history relates that Murphy did have a direct influence on the design and manufacture of Tanner's cigarette box and that it may have either been made in Murphy's Falcon Studio in Weymouth Street or in the workshop of the Central School, Silversmithing and Jewellery Department.  Certainly its design is a competent essay in English Modernism and undoubtedly shows Murphy's influence.  The engraving may have been assisted by Murphy or George T. Friend, the most accomplished engraver in London, who was a friend and associate of Murphy and who taught engraving, part time at the Central School.\n\nThis box was designed and made in 1936 in response to a Goldsmiths' Company competition for commemorative coronation items.  Evidently intended for the forthcoming coronation of Edward VIII which ultimately did not happen, the engraved Royal Crown on the lid is that of George VI.  This box was subsequently exhibited in Paris in 1937 at the Exposition Internationale des Arts et des Techniques where it won a commendation.",
