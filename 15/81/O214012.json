The suite 'White Embossings on Gray' (WEG) are an extension of ideas formulated in 'Embossed Linear Constructions' made in 1969, where, through the total elimination of colour, the line partially de-materializes.\n\nIn WEG he used the same automatic engraving mill to cut the images into the printing plates, but instead of printing blind, the plates were also inked. As the achievement of a clean line under such conditions was difficult, a paper 'Roleaf' was specifically developed for Albers to use for this suite. This is the portfolio case for the suite.",
