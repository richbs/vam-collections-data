            "public_access_description": "This fragment of stained glass depicts a pinnacle with crockets. It probably originally formed part of a canopied structure on a panel with a saint. Saints were often depicted as devotional figures standing within canopied structures in the Middle Ages and were common in churches in medieval England.\n\nIn spite of England's rich tradition of stained glass in the Middle Ages, a great deal was destroyed in the 16th and 17th century religious conflicts and only survives in a fragmentary state. \n\nThis fragment is located on a panel which is composed of many different stained glass fragments. These fragments were originally from a variety of panels made in England and in the Netherlands from the late 15th to the 16th centuries. They were part of the collection of Walter Guthrie. Collectors of stained glass in the 19th and early 20th centuries would often glaze a variety of fragments together and then display them in the windows of their homes or galleries. These are known as 'composite panels'. The current arrangement of fragments in this composite panel was done after they entered the museum's collection.\n\nThis fragments is clear glass with decoration composed of simple brown/black pigment and silver (yellow) stain. In the early part of the 14th century a new technique of decorating glass was developed. This consisted of painting a compound of silver on the back of the glass which, after firing in a kiln, turns yellow. Many panels from the 14th through to the 16th century are decorated simply in yellow (silver) stain and highlighted with a brown/black pigment.",
