The amount of silver allowed to each senior official, most typically for lighting, writing and entertaining, depended on the status of the office. The Speaker of the House of Commons from 1710-13, William Bromley ( 1663-1732 ), who used this cup and cover, was issued with 4,000 ounces of silver, a lot less than Ambassadors, but more than Privy Councillors. He received the silver in 1711. It was difficult to persuade senior Government officers to return the silver and documents reveal that William Bromley had been permitted to keep his plate in recognition of his service to the State. The silver remained in the family until it was allocated to the V&A in lieu of tax.\n\nIn addition to the cup and cover, two candlesticks and inkstand ( M 1, 2, 5-2008 ) were part of this Government silver allocation to the V&A.",

            "history_note": "The silver allocated to William Bromley (1663-1732), in his capacity of Speaker of the House of Commons from 1710-13, was much more extensive than that awarded to the Privy Council. The office of Speaker was entitled to an allocation of 4,000 oz of silver. The Jewel House papers in the National Archives record the silver issued to and received by Speaker Bromley in account, receipt and delivery books. In the delivery book entry for January 22nd 1710 can be found items \u201cdelivered unto the Right Hon. William Bromley Esq Speaker of the Hon. House of Commons by the hand of Mr Moulting For the use of his table to be returned into her Majesties Jewell Office upon demand.\u201d\n\nAmong the items listed are a silver standish and bell ( inkstand), four candlesticks and \u201c To be new made\u201d a cup and cover. The weights of the Speaker Bromley silver matches those listed in the delivery book confirming that they are the same pieces. The entry is later annotated to record that the silver has been discharged or given to Speaker Bromley after his term of office and in recognition of his service. This gifting of Jewel House plate was not unusual at a time when it was very difficult for officials to persuade senior government officers and ambassadors to return any silver issued to them. Documents in the Bromley Davenport family papers deposited at the John Rylands Library, Manchester University record the receipt of the silver in the form of an indenture agreement between William Bromley and John Charlton \u201cmaster treasurer of her majesty\u2019s jewels and plate\u201d dated 2nd Jan 1711. In addition to the standish and bell, candlesticks and cup and cover, the 3,194 ounces of silver included salvers, a teapot and stand for Bohea  (a type of black tea), and an enormous quantity of dining plate for \u201cthe use of his table\u201d such as silver cutlery, 7 dozen plates, dishes, a dish ring and cruets. Later Jewel House entries for March 13th, April 25th and June 28th show that Bromley received a large tea kettle and stand and two dishes bringing the total allocated to 4038 ounces 11 dwt. A further indenture in the family papers for 11th December 1713 records that Bromley received a further 1,051 ounces and 7 dwt of silver from the Jewel House for \u201cthe use of his table\u201d in his new role as Secretary of State. More cutlery, square salts, candlesticks, sconces, swagged dishes and two chamber pots made up this order for silver. He was appointed to the office of Secretary of State in August 1713.\n\nAll government silver was allocated by the authority of the crown and marked as such so that the Speaker Bromley plate is engraved with the Royal Coat of Arms and the initials and cipher of AR for Queen Anne. It is much rarer to find these more commonplace and plainer pieces of government issued silver than the showy, ambassadorial silver. It is extraordinary that a group should survive, with an unbroken family provenance and the support of a number of contemporary documents.",
