The subject is a rehearsal of the oratorio Judith composed by the violin virtuoso William De Fesch, with libretto by William Higgins. Judith was first performed in 1733 at Lincolns' Inn Fields in London. But this relief was made much later. It was probably executed soon after 1831, when the original Judith print by William Hogarth (1697-1764) was copy engraved by George Cruikshank (1792-1878). This view is strengthened by the style of the original frame into which the work is fastened.",
