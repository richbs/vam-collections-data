This plaquette commemorates the two years at the heart of the successful defence of Verdun by the French army. The city of Verdum on the Meuse, with its ring of forts, had been since the eighteenth century as a symbolic fortress on the road to Paris from the east. During 1916 it was at the centre of some of the fiercest fighting of the war between the French and the Germans, and terrible losses were incurred on both sides in the battle for its control. \n\nPrud'Homme, medallist and sculptor, was a pupil of Alexandre Falgui\u00e9re for sculpture and Alphe\u00e9 Dubois for medallic engraving. He was highly successful and much respected by the art establishment, and exhibited for many years at the Paris Salon. He completed his first commission for the Paris Mint in 1898.",
