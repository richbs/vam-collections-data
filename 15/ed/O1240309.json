His lavish, painterly and romantic concepts were perfectly in tune with the times and earned him an international  reputation.  By 1960, however, that style was becoming unfashionable, and Messel gradually abandoned theatre and built a new career designing luxury homes in the Caribbean. \n\nUnder the Sycamore Tree, a satire on human 'progress', was performed at the Aldwych Theatre, London, in 1952 and directed by Peter Glenville, with Alec Guinness and Diana Churchill in the leading roles.  Glenville recalled that the play was meant to be set in a modern hotel, but Messel only agreed to work on the production if, instead of a hotel, the action could take place in an underground ant colony, and if the characters could be dressed as humanised ants. \n\nThe General, played by Peter Bull. represents conservativism in the ant colony, and is opposed to the revolutionary ideas of Alec Guinness's Scientist.",
