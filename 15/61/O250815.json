Chambers has simplified the plan by removing complex side compartments, blocking the doorways with niches borrowed from other areas. In doing this, he is not seeking to improve on the masters but, as the inscription makes clear, to use them as inspiration for future projects he hoped to execute.\n\nChambers moved to London in 1755 and published his influential Treatise on Civil Architecture in 1759.  Chambers demonstrated the breadth of his style in buildings such as Gower (later Carrington) House and Melbourne House, London, in such country houses as Duddingston, Scotland, and in the garden architecture he designed for Wilton House, Wiltshire, and at Kew Gardens. He became head of government building in 1782, and in this capacity built Somerset House, London.",
