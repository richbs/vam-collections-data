This fabric might have been used for curtains or upholstery. In this period it was particularly fashionable for the different furnishings used in a room, including window curtains and upholstery fabric, to match or complement each other.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe 'lapis style' used in the printing of this cotton was invented in England. It was developed by Daniel Koechlin-Schouc in Mulhouse, France, and James Thompson at the Primrose Works, Clitheroe, Lancashire. The technique depends on the use of a  resist-red (coarsely printed here because thickened with pipe-clay) which simultaneously acts as a mordant for madder dye and as a resist to indigo. (Mordants allow certain dyestuffs to release their colours, while resists prevent others from fixing to the cloth.) The style was much used for handkerchiefs, and more rarely for furnishing prints.",
