            "physical_description": "Painting, in opaque watercolour and gold on paper, a garden setting with a pavilion in the background is the scene for a loving couple who embrace surrounded by female attendants and musicians.  The lovers are both female with the turbaned figure in front offering a small gold cup to the lady seated slightly behind her, who, in turn, looks sideways towards her lover, while gently placing her hand on the other's breast.\n      The turbaned figure wears a gauzy <i>peshwaz</i> with a gold paned skirt and golden lappets edging the front opening to the waist.  She wears gold <i>paijama</i> with golden floral motifs and a gold <i>patka</i> ornamented with mauve flower decoration.  The turban on her head is red and gold with a floral gold band edged in pearls and a pendant jewel on the front.  She also wears gold bangles and armbands, and short and long rows of pearl necklaces.\n      Her companion has a long sleeved and high-necked gauzy dress ribbed in gold, over which she wears similar necklaces with the addition of a green-beaded necklace.  She wears bright green <i>paijama</i> with gold-rimmed mauve leaf ornamentation and a floral gold <i>patka</i>.  A gold-edged transparent <i>odhini</i> covers her hair.  She has elaborate pearl earrings and a hair pendant.\n      The standing attendant to the left holds a flask and she is dressed in a <i>peshwaz</i> with a green  hat without a brim with a black aigrette fixed to the front.  The other attendant kneels in front of the couple offering a dish.  She, too wears a transparent <i>peshwaz</i> and a gold-edged, transparent <i>odhini</i>, as do the two further kneeling ladies on the right: one holding a sitar while the other claps her hands.\n       The couple sit on a rug with cushions and a bolster with a variety of vessels spread out in front of them and the musicians.  They are placed within a rectangular space surrounded by a red-latticed balustrade in the middle of a formal garden with trees, shrubs and flowers set in an arrangement of square beds.  In the centre of the foreground a small fountain plays in a square-shaped pool.  This is mirrored by another fountain in a scalloped-edged pool within a white-roofed pavilion with wooden walls and a red canopy decorated with golden arabesque patterns and a green fringe.  An open doorway beyond gives onto a wooded scene and more water.  Tree tops against a blue sky can be glimpsed above a white wall behind the pavilion.\n       The painting is framed with gold lines with black and white rulings either side of an applied strip of cream-coloured paper decorated with a scroll of stylised floral motifs.  The narrow ivory-coloured main border has a decorative row of alternate painted small lilies and poppies outlined in gold.  The margins of the page have applied strips of buff-coloured paper with a white outline on the inner side, and an additional pinkish-buff strip added as an inner margin to create a gutter for the album binding.",

It contains 56 leaves on which are Mughal miniature paintings, drawing and flower studies on both sides. The binding is covered with an Indian brocade silk that may have been cut from lengths brought home by the 2nd Lord Clive, who served as Governor of Madras, 1799 to 1803.  The album was sold from Powis Castle at Sotheby's sale, 16 to 18 January 1956, lot 332A.",
