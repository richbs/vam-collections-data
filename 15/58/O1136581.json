            "bibliography": "<u>100 Great Paintings in The Victoria & Albert Museum.</u>London: V&A, 1985, p.46\nThe following is adapted from the entry: \n\n\"This is one of a remarkable series of fifty-nine paintings on thirty-three sheets of flowers, fruits, butterflies and moths, which were painted by a 16th-century artist whose life, both in the New and the Old World, had in its narrow escapes from death, and dramatic vicissitudes of fortune, the quality of an epic adventure story. \n\nBorn in Dieppe in 1533, Jacques Le Moyne De Morgues was a Hugenot. In 1564 he was selected as cartographer and artist to accompany an expedition to relieve an earlier settlement of French Hugenots in Florida. His account of the ill starred expedition makes gripping reading. It tells of warring tribes of Indians, mutiny amongst the French camp, of famine, and the providential arrival of the English privateer Sir John Hawkins with supplies. His story culminates in an exciting account of his escape from Fort Carolina during the massacre of the garrison by the Spanish fleet. \n\nOn his return to France Le Moyne was commanded by Charles X to lay before him his maps and paintings of the Indians. These pictures (in engraved form) and his story were published after his death by Theodore de Bry in 1591 in <i>Les Grands Voyages</i>. \n\nIn 1572 Le Moyne made his way to London to avoid the growing hostility to the Hugenots which was to culminate in the Massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day. There he was taken into service by Sir Waiter Raleigh, and came to know Sir Philip Sidney, Hakluyt, and the botanist Gervais, author of a famous <i>Herbal.</i> \n\nIt was in London that Le Moyne published in 1586 his own <i>La Clef des Champs</i> illustrated with botanical woodcuts with which the fifty-nine paintings in the Victoria and Albert Museum are closely connected. He died at Blackfriars two years later in 1588. \n\nThe Victoria and Albert Museum's water-colours by Le Moyne are outstanding botanical illustrations, remarkable for their directness and truth to nature. But ironically they were initially acquired in 1856 as one of the first purchases of the Museum, almost by accident, and solely because they were bound up in an extremely fine French late-16th-century brown calf binding. Since the discovery of the importance of the water-colours in 1922, they have been mounted separately, and can be studied in the Print Room.\n\nLionel Lambourne\"\nPaul Hulton, <u>The Work of Jacques Le Moyne de Morgues, A Huguenot Artist in France, Florida and England</u>, vol.
