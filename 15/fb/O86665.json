It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years. Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn\u2019t needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.    \n\nSinger Adelaide Hall, born in New York, began her career as a dancer. She appeared in the 1921 Broadway show Shuffle Along and starred at jazz clubs and in the hit Broadway revue Blackbirds of 1928. She made London her home in the 1940s,  performed with E.N.S.A., and continued as a popular broadcasting and stage singer.",
