Harvey, most famous for his 1993 play Beautiful Thing, which was later turned into a successful film.\n\nCloser to Heaven centres on the character 'Straight' Dave, who is working in a gay nightclub as a barman, with ambitions to be a dancer. The drama revolves around his realisation of his sexuality and his discovery of drug culture, while his girlfriend learns about her estranged father, the owner of the nightclub.\n\nAn innovative topic for a musical at the time, Closer to Heaven was a reasonable success, opening in May 2001 and closing five months later. The combination of writer Jonathan Harvey, whose gay-themed plays had seen him win many writing awards, and new music written by Pet Shop Boys, who have sold over 50 million albums worldwide, should have seen the play go on to further success, as many other West End musicals with music by famous bands have done. Unlike other West End shows, however,  Closer to Heaven featured all original songs and was written by a challenging, yet populist, playwright.",
