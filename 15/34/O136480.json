What they wanted was an attractive illustration of renowned warrior horsemen and their noble animals. It is difficult to understand now, in the age of the internal combustion engine, the sheer pervasiveness of nineteenth century hippomania. Sporting print shops were common, their stock largely consisting of all manner of horse portraits, pictures of jockeys, famous horsemen, hunters, in fact anything to do with horses at all. Alken was an artist and printmaker who first published his prints under the pseudonym `Ben Tally Ho!' and went on to become perhaps the best known maker of sporting prints. Portraits of horses and horsemen were more valued than other more conventional portraits. For example, a coloured engraving after a portrait by Sir Thomas Lawrence sold for about \u00a32; a set of eight sporting prints after Alken by the same printmaker cost \u00a350, an enormous sum in the nineteenth century.",
