When the church was demolished in 1617, the monument was disassembled and never reconstructed.  The other portions which have survived are now preserved in the Cathedral at Montepulciano.  The monument was commissioned by Aragazzi from the joint studio of Donatello and Michelozzo in or shortly before 1427 and was completed in 1438.  All of the surviving sculptures from the tomb are by Michelozzo.",
