The printed note on the cover dedicates it 'To Edgar Bruce Esq.', the manager of the Prince of Wales Theatre who originally produced the play and who transferred it to the Imperial Theatre in 1883 and the new Prince\u2019s Theatre in 1884.\n\nThe aesthetic satire The Colonel opened on 2nd February at the Prince of Wales Theatre. Adapted by F.C. Burnand, it concerned the duplicitous Professor of Aesthetics Lambert Streyke and his supposed painter nephew, Basil Giorgione, who were thinly-disguised caricatures of  the perceived leaders of the 'Aesthetic school' Oscar Wilde and James Whistler. Du Maurier advised Burnand on the design, and the resulting drawing room set, with Morris wallpaper, a dado, blue china, lilies, peacock feathers and Japanese fans, proved so attractive that several critics considered The Colonel a good advertisement for the style it intended to mock. Lilies, a sunflower and a peacock feather also feature in this music sheet cover.",

            "historical_context_note": "<i>The Colonel</i> was first produced at the Prince of Wales\u2019s Theatre on 2nd February 1881, and its initial run  lasted for 550 performances. Simultaneously, a second company was touring the provinces. On 4th October 1881, <i>The Colonel</i> became the first play in twenty years, since the death of Prince Albert in 1861, to receive a Command Performance before Queen Victoria. The theatre\u2019s manager, Edgar Bruce, transferred it to the Imperial Theatre in 1883 and the new Prince\u2019s Theatre in 1884. In July 1887, there was a revival at the Comedy Theatre. \n\nLike many contemporary English theatrical entertainments, the play is based on a French model: Jean Fran\u00e7ois Bayard\u2019s <i>Le mari \u00e0 la campagne</i>, first produced in 1844, and adapted for the English stage in 1849 by Morris Barnett as <i>The Serious Family</i> (there was also a German version, <i>Er mu\u00df auf\u2019s Land</i>, 1846). These comedies are based on a Tartuffe-type plot about a well-situated family infiltrated by a religious impostor who threatens to gain control over the family and its fortune and is thwarted by the intervention of an old friend who comes to the rescue: by a naval officer in the French original; by an Irish army captain in <i>The Serious Family</i>; and by the American colonel after whom the play is named in the later adaptation. In all versions, a young husband uses the pretence of going \u201cto the country\u201d \u2014 hence the title of Bayard\u2019s play \u2014 as a means of escaping his oppressive domestic circumstances. In all versions, too, the family friend restores the husband\u2019s supremacy in his home by pointing out to the misguided wife the dangers inherent in suppressing innocent and fashionable pleasures in the name of an exaggerated devotion. Burnand\u2019s most important modification to this plot consists in substituting aesthetic impostors for the religious hypocrites of the earlier versions.",
