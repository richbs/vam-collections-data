This production first opened at His Majesty's Theatre in April 1908 but was revived on several subsequent occasions.\n\nSir Herbert Beerbohm Tree (1853-1917) was London's leading actor-manager in the Edwardian era. He built His Majesty's Theatre in London's Haymarket which opened in 1897, and his spectacular productions there became famous for their detailed and realistic settings. Tree himself was celebrated for his ability to transform his features for every different role.\n\nThe photograph appears to have been taken by the photographer F.W.Burford. Beneath the image is a dedication to Mr. William Clarkson. \n\nWilliam Clarkson was the owner of Clarkson's Wigs, Wellington Street, London. This business supplied wigs for numerous leading Victorian actors and actresses amongst them Dame Ellen Terry (1848-1928) and Sir Henry Irving (1838-1905). It also acted as a theatrical costumier and property maker. First established as a business in 1833, Willy Clarkson (full name was William Berry Clarkson) took over the business after his father's death in 1878. By 1904 his success was such that he built new premises in Wellington Street. The programme for the 1908 production of The Merchant of Venice states that W.Clarkson provided the wigs.",
