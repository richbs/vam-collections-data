            "physical_description": "Woven silk satin embroidered with couched metal thread and silk in straight stitches faced with woven silk and a backing of woven silk. \nPieced, 'gold' satin central field with an irregular square of silver metal thread in a series of diagonal lines holding an orange and light green 4-petalled rosette. The ground has four rows of four whirling, 4 armed shapes.  Rows 1-3 inclusive have the whirling 4-armed motif in the following colours:\n[1] 4 small tri-lobed sections in silver on light blue, or silver on coral red behind the 4 [clockwise] S-direction arms, in silver on white core or silver on yellow core.\n[2] the central lobed square in either silver on blue or silver on coral red lies on top of the four arms, again silver on white core, or silver on yellow silk.\n[3] as [2] but alternating colours.\n[4] as with [1] with the whirling arms meeting over a black shape, 3 of which are square in outline and one has 4 small tri-lobed sections in alternate silver on light blue or silver on coral red.  However the arms are different from [1] as the arms in two of the 4 motifs are silver on yellow, terminating in silver on white leaf forms, or vica versa.\nIn between the four rows, longitudinally and laterally are a small Z-shaped motif in orange cutting across a bar of two small leaves in silver on light blue.  Row 4 has the Z-form in silver on light blue across a silver on pink leaf-bar. And also a simple lobed 4-petalled rosette in green and coral red over the seams.\nAll the motifs were originally outlined with black silk.\nThe central field is framed by a 7 cm deep border of green silk satin [pieced] with pairs of leaves forming a meander.  These leaves are in silver on a white silk core with two areas, either side in orange, and where the leaf pairs join is an inverted U-form in silver on yellow silk core with two small leaf hapes in silver on coral red.  All are outlined with black silk. It seems that the original colour of the satin was light blue and this was resist-dyed to make a green; the light blue was then embroidered with couching and straight stitches.\nThere are the remains of under-drawing.\nEmbroidery Threads: 2S-plied silk: yellow, green, white, orange.\nMetal thread: silver strip close S-wound around a silk core of various colours: white, coral red, possibly two shades of light blue, golden yellow. Black silk has been used as an outline.\nBacking: mid-blue plain weave silk, pieced, with some green dye stains.\nFacing: black plain weave silk, bias-cut",
