Beer was the most common drink in Britain until tea became cheaper and more freely available in the late 18th century. People also drank German mineral water, which was served in stoneware bottles.\n\nThis jug has an engraved coat of arms impaling another coat of arms added later (around 1751) and may have been a prestigious commission. Simon Pantin, the distinguished Huguenot goldsmith who made it, registered his mark in 1701. The Huguenots were French Protestants who fled to Britain to avoid religious persecution after their freedom to worship (the Edict of Nantes) was revoked in 1685. The skills they brought with them had a marked influence on British silverware.",
