Mascots are used to communicate the Olympic spirit to the general public, especially youth and children. They are usually a character or animal native to the country where the games are being held and showcase the history and culture unique to the host city. In more recent years it has been common to have more than one mascot. This could be to ensure gender equity but has undoubtedly increased the merchandising potential of the Olympic mascot.\n\nMiga the Seabear is one of three mascots used at the 2010 Vancouver Olympic Games. The character is based partly on the Spirit bear, a rare white bear unique to BC, and partly on Pacific Northwest First Nations tales of orca whales that transform into bears when they arrive on land. \n\nThe other two mascots are Quatchi the Sasquatch and Sumi a Chimera. All three were designed from legends of Canadian Aborginal culture but other influences include the Olympic and Paralympic movements, modern animation styles and the culture and wildlife of British Columbia and Canada. The three mascots have been featured in a series of videos in which they are joined by a virtual friend called Mukmuk who is a rare marmot from the mountains of Vancouver Island.",
