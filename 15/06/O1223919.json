Small Shots\u2122 came with their own pieces of track, included in their packaging but were also intended to be compatible to run on Hot Wheels\u2122 track too. Funny Fran, was one of the various collectible characters produced in the series which also included Breezy Bridgit, Nifty Nan and Daredevil Dexter. Small Shots\u2122 were not a huge success and appear to have only been produced for about 3 years.",
