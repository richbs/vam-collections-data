Both tea and coffee drinking were approved and elaborated social rituals. The wealthiest classes demanded a tea equipage in a material, decoration or style that reflected their status, and this imposing silver-gilt tray would have formed part of an elaborate, expensive service. It is engraved with the coronet of the Dukes of Hamilton, the premier dukedom of Scotland. \n\nForm\nThis elliptical tray, with its fluted, scalloped rim is characteristic of the first third of the 18th century, and such examples survive in some quantity. Spoon trays of this date generally do not have feet, and would have been placed directly on the table.",
