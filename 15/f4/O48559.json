As more salt cellars for the use of individual guests appeared on dining tables, it was more polite and elegant for guests to use spoons rather than their fingers or the point of a knife to take salt and put it on their plates.\n\nDesign & Designing\nSalt spoons, especially those made before the 19th century, can be shovel or shell-shaped. This salt spoon, however, is of a miniature ladle style with a wide, deep bowl and curved handle. The ladle style became popular from about 1780.\n\nManufacturer\nThe salt spoon was perhaps made by the manufacturers Samuel  Roberts and Charles Belk of Sheffield, Yorkshire. One of the specialities of the firm was the production of spoons and forks.",
