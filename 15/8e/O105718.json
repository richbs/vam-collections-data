Loss of page area had occurred, particularly at the tail fore edge corner. The binding had become severely deteriorated and was considered unsuitable for reuse.\nThe text block was collated and disbound. The soft, mould-damaged areas were considered too weak to withstand handling in their deteriorated state and so were consolidated with methylcellulose. Torn areas were repaired with the lightest weight Japanese tissue. When the text block was re-sewn each leaf was sewn with a  supporting sheet which is intended to be used to turn the pages, thus preventing unnecessary handling of the weak areas.\nThe sewn text block was given a handmade paper wrapper as a cover, It is hoped that this very specific style of binding will give the pages as flat a page opening as possible ensuring that free corners of the inconveniently attached sketches and drawings will not be creased or folded over as the album is leafed through."
