There are obvious traces of Raphael's influence in the drawing on the &lt;i&gt;recto&lt;/i&gt;. \nThe inscription resembles some that have been noticed on certain Tiepolo drawings. See G. Knox and C. Thiem, catalogue of an exhibition of Tiepolo drawings, Stuttgart, 1970, p. 8. See also pl. 29 there. According to Knox the abbreviation Xrs stands for Kreutzers, coins used in Venice under Austrian rule 1797-1805 and 1815-66.",
