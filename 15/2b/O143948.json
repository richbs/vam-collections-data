Talbot's photographic discoveries of the 1830s through Talbot's friends and relatives who lived near to Jones in South Wales. Subsequently, Jones became on of the few Britons to to produce a substantial body of calotypes in Britain and abroad. His work stands out in the early devopment of photography because of his ability to fuse his technical skill with the influence of his traing as a watercolorist.\n\nIn 1853, Jones moved to Belgium and remained there until the death of his wife in 1856. He took photographs during this period, notably in Bruges and Ghent. This unidentified location was one of that series of photographs.",
