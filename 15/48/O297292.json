Resist-dyeing involves treating certain areas of the cloth with a \u2018resist\u2019 to prevent them absorbing the dye.  In this case starch has been used as the resist; it has been applied through a metal stencil.  The cloth is made out of two lengths of cotton shirting, identically patterned, sewn together to form a shape that is roughly square. They were worn by women as wraparound skirts.\n\nThe pattern centred on a medallion which features a king and queen.  This was a common design on adire cloths and was derived from images of George V and Mary produced on souvenirs and advertisements in 1935 to mark the Silver Jubilee.  The king and queen are generally paired with al buraq, the horse that carried the Islamic prophet Mohammed to heaven.  In this example the horse had been obscured by starch combed in a figure of eight pattern, his legs however remain visible.",
