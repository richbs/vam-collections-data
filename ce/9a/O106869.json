Along the top edge are a dragon, a dog and a hare in the round; the nozzle of the flask is in the form of a dragon's head, at the other end is a human head with ram's horns. The flask is German and dates to about 1690-1700. \nPowder flasks or horns are portable containers of wood, horn, metal, leather or ceramic used to hold the priming powder or gunpowder for firearms. They normally terminated in a metal nozzle which also served as a powder measure, closed by a plug or spring cap, and are often highly decorated.\nGunpowder began to be transported in pouches or more rigid containers at about the same date as the introduction of hand-held firearms in the fifteenth century. Such flask might have a military purpose, or be used for hunting. The very decorative pieces were above all a singn of rank, and at the same time aesthetic objects in their own right, and probably never actually functioned as containers for gunpowder.",

Alexander James Beresford Beresford-Hope Esq. M.P. The ivory is in the tradition of the works of Johann Michael Maucher (1645-after 1690), although the carving is somewhat broad, and the present work probably dates from the end of the seventeenth century. A parallel for the overall form is provided by a powder flask in the Bayrisches Nationalmuseum, Munich (inv. no. 13, 206), although interestingly the Munich example, thought to be eighteenth-century, is inscribed with Russian mottoes, and is therefore believed to be Russian.",
