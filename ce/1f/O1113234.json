Most theatres and some circuses in the 19th century had some made to mark grand openings or milestone performances. By the end of the First World War however the practice had generally died out, only being revived very occasionally, more often at London's opera houses than any other theatres.\n\nThis was produced as a souvenir the performance of Harmston's Circus in Calcutta on the 26th December because of the presence of Lord and Lado Minto in the audience. It was also a Benefit Night, a charity performance when half the profits of the performance were given to Lady Minto's Fete Fund. Lord Minto was Viceroy and Governor-General of India from 1905 to1910.\n\nHarmston's Circus was founded by the equestrian William Batty Harmston (1844-1893), born in Nottingham. After working with Chiarini's circus in India in 1887, he formed his own circus which toured Australia 1890-1891. After his death in Singapore, his widow carried on the circus with the manager Robert Love, who she married and whose surname can be seen on this programme added to her name and that of her children.",
