H. Chirgwin was a talented musician who played a variety of stringed instruments and was well  known for playing the 'Jap fiddle', the one-stringed bowed instrument depicted here, named after its similarity  to the Japanese instrument the koky\u016b. The 'Jap fiddle' was popular with street performers, music hall  performers and vaudevillians in the United Kingdom and the USA in the early 20th century. Chirgwin's characteristic diamond-shaped white eye  make-up is said to have developed from the day he accidentally wiped his face  when made up as a black-face minstrel.",
