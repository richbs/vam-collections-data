He had been a magistrate in his native China and came to Britain with no directly transferable profession. He turned his hand to painting and writing as a means of survival, as well as of self expression. Chiang was educated and well versed in the practical and intellectual traditions of Chinese painting. He drew heavily on this knowledge when he painted British scenes and he often treated his British subjects in a recognisably Chinese manner. His Silent Traveller books are a combination of sensitively observed illustrations, eloquent prose and perceptive humour. They present a unique account of Britain. \nThe Lake District held a particular appeal for Chiang because of its historic association with Britain\u2019s artistic and literary elite. Turner, Constable and Wordsworth all found inspiration in the Lakes. Chiang followed in their footsteps and created his ownunique interpretation of the landscape.\nChiang painted the famous landscapes of the Lake District using the Chinese materials and techniques familiar to him. Although he depicts the scenery in a Chinese manner, the British countryside is still recognisable.",
