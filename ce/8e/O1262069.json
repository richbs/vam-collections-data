            "public_access_description": "This costume was made for Prospect Theatre Company\u2019s 1968 production of Richard II starring 29-year-old Ian McKellen as the King. Its five week tour was such a success that a second tour, starting at the Edinburgh Festival, was followed by a sell-out London run. It established McKellen as a  leading actor. Prospect was a small company with a limited funds. The set for Richard II was basic, and designer Tim Goodchild spent most of his minuscule budget on costume. This golden tabard for King Richard is typically late 1960s in design and making. Based on medieval heraldry, it looks suitably historical but is actually made up of a collage of modern materials. The basic fabric is furnishing brocade highlighted with gold paint. The heraldic lions sit amid a riot of gold  mesh, glass \u2018jewels\u2019, gold raffia, felt and fake leather. Coins and even metal beer-bottle tops enhance the richness. The gold lam\u00e9 lining had to be partially covered with clear polythene to protect it as it dragged across the stage. Reviews pronounced the production an \u2018uncontested triumph\u2019.",
