            "public_access_description": "Grover Cleveland (18 March 1837- 24 June 1908) was the 22nd and 24th President of the United States. This cup was given to him on his seventieth birthday on 18 March 1907 and features the shield and motto of Princeton university.\n\nGrover was not an alumnus of Princeton University himself. In fact he never attended college, but was forced to leave school after his father\u2019s death in 1853. Nonetheless, he was an ardent supporter and friend of Princeton University after a first visit in 1896, and bought property near the campus. His home, Westland Mansion, in Princeton/New Jersey, soon became an important destination of undergraduate processions including an annual birthday parade on 18 March. On Cleveland\u2019s seventieth birthday this cup was given to him by undergraduates, and presented by Professor John Grier Hibben.\n\nTiffany &amp; Co. was an important provider of presentation silver from its very beginning, including a ewer presented to President Abraham Lincoln for his inauguration in 1861 (The Smithsonian Institution, Washington D.C.). This cup is remarkable not only for the choice of gold over silver, but also for its clear, classical design that emphasizes form over decoration.\n\n\nGiving gold or silver cups as symbol of friendship and appreciation has a long-standing tradition, and the Gilbert Collection includes several examples dating from the 17th century onwards. The gold cup for Grover Cleveland is not only the most recent loving cup in the collection, it is also an usually rich and generous example of American university plate.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes. Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
