            "physical_description": "Cover, silk satin embroidered with couched metal thread and coloured silk in satin stitch, faced with patterned cotton and backed with undecorated cotton twill.\nThe central panel 54.4 x 54 cm] has a light green silk satin ground with a radiating design from a small irregular central rosette with silver metal thread couched with red silk forming a spiral in the centre.  There are four pink/beige leaves and four smaller light green and yellow leaves.  From the rosette emerge eight straight stem supporting alternate flowering forms, one larger than the other. [1] pointing to each corner, a stem carrying two tarnished 'gold' and two half leaves in four shades of pink/beige leading into a large exotic tulip-like flower head with alternate petals in beige/brown, 'silver' and 'gold' thread with some details in blue and white; [2] in between, a smaller version of [1] but in a more closed form with a stem cluster rather than leaf design; the same palette of silk embroidery. In places a couched outline of 2-ply black silk twisted with silver thread remains. Between this panel and the border and again between the border and the facing there is a narrow border of 2 lines of black silk thread held in place by silver metal thread. Traces of under-drawing.\nBorder: pieced red silk satin with a light green selvedge and embroidered over the seams. There is an undulating stem with serrated leaves in silver metal thread and 'gold' 5-petalled rosettes with silver coiled centres and blue details and buds in three shades of beige and cream with small blue leaf details. Traces of under-drawing.\nMetal thread: silver strip close S-wound on white silk generally couched with white silk in a twill pattern; silver metal thread close S-wound on yellow Z-twisted silk couched with red silk in twill pattern, creating an effect of gold.\nSilk threads: 2S twist silk: light blue, dark blue, white, cream, light pink, beige, dark beige, brown, grey.\nFacing: bias-cut, dark blue cotton satin woven with a twill pattern of botehs in yellow, white, pink and light green.\nBacking: unpatterned red cotton twill.",
