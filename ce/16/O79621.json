It is more likely that these pieces were made as souvenirs.    \n\nThe V&A had been collecting traditional jewellery of all kinds, then usually called peasant jewellery, throughout the second half of the 19th century, and had already acquired some similar Algerian pieces in 1870.  Despite their appearance these pieces are quite different from true Algerian traditional jewellery, which tends to be larger, heavier, and usually made of silver, rather than silver-plated brass, as here.",
