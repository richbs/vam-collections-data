E.1355-1962\n\nThe cold blooded Gaston Auguste (1830-1909), Marquis de Gallifet, formerly an officer in Napoleon's household, is represented with his blood-letting equipment. His ruthless supervision of the columns of haggard communards on the walk from Paris to Versailles earned him a justified reputation for cruelty. At his temporary headquarters at the Port de la Muette he operated his own sifting system. Any communards with grey hair, who might therefore be old enough to have fought in the 1848 revolution, any prisoners wearing watches which might indicate that they were communard officials, and any who caught his attention by their pluck, exhaustion or for any other reason, were immediately taken into the Bois de Boulogne and shot.'\n<u>Victoria & Albert Museum Department of Prints and Drawings and Department of Paintings, Accessions 1962</u>.
