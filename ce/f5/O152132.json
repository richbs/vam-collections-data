Although his work later became figurative, in the 1970s he was working in a more abstract style, although still with reference to real objects. This print relates very closely to pieces in wood he was making  in the early 1970s which took the form of crates and similar constructions. In some of these pieces Williams seems to be working with a cross-over from two to three dimensions, using the idea of a shadow as a solid part of the sculpture which at the same time remains flat. His screenprints at the time reflect this interest in spatial ambivalence.",
