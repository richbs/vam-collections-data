            "history_note": "This relief was purchased in Florence, and on acquisition was described by Fortnum as being \u201cin the manner of Leonardo da Vinci\u201d. The same composition exists in a second version in the Palazzo Chigi-Saracini in Siena. Both are very close in style and handling to two reliefs in bronze, a Lamentation in the Carmini in Venice, and a Flagellation in the Pinacoteca at Perugia.\n\nIt has been attributed at various points to Leonardo, Andrea del Verrocchio, Antonio Pollaiuolo, Bertoldo di Giovanni, and to Francesco di Giorgio. In favour of the latter artist are: the relation of the architectural features in the relief, the Perugia Flagellation, and to motifs in di Giorgio\u2019s work at Urbino and elsewhere; that the Venice Lamentation was originally in the Oratorio di Santa Croce in Urbino, where di Giorgio is known to have worked; the connection between the figures in the relief to drawings by di Giorgio.\n\nIf the relief, like the Lamentation, was executed in Urbino it can be dated to after the bronze was cast, in 1475-7. The relief in the Palazzo Chigi-Saracini has been somewhat damaged, and seems to be blunter than the V&A\u2019s piece. The main differences between the two are that in the Chigi-Saracini relief the right arm and stave of the central female figure are missing, and the feet of the male nudes standing in the central archway are shown.\n\nIt is possible that the two reliefs are earlier and later casts taken from a wax model, or alternatively that they are modified casts from a bronze relief, however the evidence is inconclusive.\n\nOn acquisition, the relief was described as \u201cthe Genius of Discord and the results of her influence\u201d. As a narrative, the main features are: that it represents a conflict in which a number of unarmed women are slaughtered by men; all the figures apart from the fleeing female figure in the centre and one ambiguous figure by the throne, are nude; the dominant figures are the fleeing woman in the centre and the male nude on the right whose gesture seems to be one of pleading but who conceals a sword behind his back; that all the male figures on the left are spectators of, not participants in, the scene. Various interpretations have been ascribed to the scene, including the slaughter of the Maenads by Lycurgus, or that it is an Amazon scene. However they have been rejected for want of conclusive representations within the scene of attributes associated with these legends.\n\nHistorical significance: This relief represents the use of linear perspective in representing the buildings and figures in the distance. The key principle of this technique was that there should be one vanishing point within the work, and this can be seen in the centre where the buildings recede. This technique was particularly useful for relief sculpture of complicated scenes, as it gave the sculptor a way of depicting naturalistic backgrounds as well as introduce many more figures and motifs into the scene in the middle- and back-ground.",

            "historical_context_note": "Francesco di Giorgio was one of the earliest artists in Siena to use detailed and logical perspective within his relief work, and his figures vary from faint profiles to fully modelled statuettes. His work moved on from that of his master, Lorenzo Vecchietta, in stylistic, if not iconographic, ways. Di Giorgio\u2019s style added to the relief style a logical representational technique, a grasp of movement, and a sense of atmosphere. He had been in contact with Leonardo da Vinci when he was in Milan, which can be seen in the style of this relief.",
