The wings are two pieces of felt sewn together and then sewn onto the main body either side. The legs and beak are also stitched on in an orange coloured felt. The beak has a small bit of padding and the legs have a metal structure within to allow the toy to stand. The duck has a blue head scarf tied around its neck, which has an orange felt heart sewn onto the left side. Its eyes are glued on with a larger white circle and a small black circle together. There is a red plastic triangular label tied around its front with purple thread. The label is the mark from the manufacturer and reads the same on both sides, 'Clemens Spieltiere Made in W-Germany'.",

This is a trademark of the Clemens bear and the tag has changed very little since the companies inception in 1952. They initially started off as a metal tag but during 1963 and 1968, a red plastic tag was used, which is the type on this toy. In 1989, the company went back to using metal tags, hung on a blue ribbon to symbolise reliability and a unique design.\n\nClemens was established by Hans Clemens in Germany, shortly after the Second World War. He had lost everything due to the war so opened a retail business specialising in glass porcelain and gifts. However, due to the demand from customers for teddy bears, he began making bears from old army blankets. His son, Peter Clemens took over the business but retired in 2002. The company, however, are still producing new bears today.",
