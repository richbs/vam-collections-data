The designer has to be very sensitive to these qualities, but not be over-specific in interpreting a meaning in the costumes and sets.  \n\tRequiem was Kenneth MacMillan's response to the death of his friend and colleague, choreographer John Cranko.  His designer, Yolanda Sonnabend, was also a well-known portrait painter, expert at suggesting hidden depths below an obvious surface.  The set was a series of square columns, reminiscent of a huge cathedral, but lit from within, so that the source of light seemed withheld.  The costumes echoed a sense of revealed emotion, the lines running down the bodies suggesting a body reduced to raw  arteries and emotion.  There is no indication of the back of the costume; Sonnabend knew that the costume painters would understand how the design should be continued on the back.",
