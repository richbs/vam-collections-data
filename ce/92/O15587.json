These garments were an ideal canvas for her bright, painterly patterns. This coat was originally worn over a screen-printed chiffon hooded dress in matching colours, with a pair of yellow patent shoes by Charles Jourdan. It was worn by Irene Worth in the Royal Shakespeare Company's production of Edward Albee's play Tiny Alice staged at the Aldwych Theatre, London, in 1970. \n\nThe coat forms part of the Cecil Beaton Collection.This Collection was brought together by the society photographer Sir Cecil Beaton (1904-1980). With great energy and determination, Beaton contacted the well-dressed elite of Europe and North America to help create this lasting monument to the art of dress. The Collection was exhibited in 1971, accompanied by a catalogue that detailed its enormous range.",
