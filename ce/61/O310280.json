A sword and cloak carved of wood are lying on the rectangular wood base.  One of the figures has a wood sword in his belt, which is separately added. The other holds a goblet of wood in his left hand, which is also separate. The faces and hands are of ivory, and ivory pieces are ingeniously set into the wood folds of the drapery, imitating portions of revealed flesh, as if their clothes were in rags. The pupils of the glass eyes are black. They are mounted on a base.",

In style it prefigures the work of the Munich sculptor Simon Troger, whose ivory and wood figures became popular in South Germany and elsewhere in the mid-eighteenth century. The present subjects are also reminiscent of commedia dell'arte groups. Similar figures are to be seen in Dresden, Munich, and Nuremberg, as noted by Longhurst. A series of wood and ivory groups associated with the Passion now in the Museo degli Argenti in Florence are closely analogous. These were brought to Florence by Ferdinand III de' Medici from W\u00fcrzburg in 1814, and are thought to date from the early eighteenth century (Aschengreen Piacenti 2011).",
