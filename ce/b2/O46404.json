The poster was overprinted with the names of the tour venues.\n\nHistorical significance: Foe is a re-telling of Daniel Defoe's classic novel Robinson Crusoe.  In this re-telling a woman called Susan Barton is shipwrecked on a remote island with a white man, Cruso (this is Coetzee's spelling of the name) and his black slave, Friday.  She is rescued and returns to London with Friday, Cruso having died on the voyage.  There she dreams of becoming famous and searches out Daniel Foe (Defoe's real name) to write her story.",
