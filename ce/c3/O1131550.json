A hand embroidered design, in white satin stitch, of flowers within semi-circular motifs, is stitched around the neck and the tops of the shoulders.  The garment fastens at the back with hooks and eyes.\n[short trousers] (original 1967 record) The trousers are of matching material, and knee-length.  They taper slightly towards the knees.  They fasten at the sides with pearl buttons.  A pocket is inserted at the right.  Two bone buttons are stitched at the back, and four at the front, to attach to the bodice.\n[bodice] (original 1967 record) The bodice is of white cotton, sleeveless, with high round neck, and [is] waist length.  The front is faced with white linen.  There are four vertical button holes at the bottom front and two rows of two (one above the other) at the back.  A tear between the two on the right hand side suggests that the second row was added as the child grew.  The bodice closes with linen-covered buttons.",
