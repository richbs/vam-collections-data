            "public_access_description": "Fukami's achievement lies in his mastery not so much of hand-building techniques as of slip-casting in large plaster moulds. Consisting of components as heavy as can be moved about the workshop, these moulds can weigh 150-200kg (330-440lb) when assembled. They are used to produce limited editions, not usually exceeding eight casts, from an original hand-modelled ceramic form. Liquid porcelain is forced into the moulds under high pressure, compaction of the clay particles preventing the wraping that would otherwise occur during firing. Once a cast is dry enough to be removed from its moulds, scrapers and other implements are used to smooth and sharpen it into final form. Firing is carried out, one piece at a time in the case of large works such as the one illustrated here, in an electric kiln. The reducing atmosphere needed to produce the pale blue colour of the glaze is achieved by the burning of liquid propane gas during the latter part of the gloss firing. \nFukami was born into an established Kyoto pottery making family specializing in high quality tablewares. This is reflected in the elegant wheel-thrown vessels he produces in parallel with his slip-cast sculptural works. Fashioned from porcelain covered in pale blue glaze, they make indirect but unmistakable reference to the sharply pottered forms of Chinese Song period qingbai wares from the Jingdezhen kilns in Jiangxi Province.",
