It was revived at London's Regent Theatre on 24th May 1924, with John Gielgud as Romeo. \n\nAnother painting in the museum's collection shows Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies in the same role, painted by Laura Knight who depicted her in her dressing room at the Regent Theatre. Years later Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies recalled that the Juliet underdress was corn-yellow satin as can be glimpsed in this painting, and not pink which was how it was depicted by Laura Knight.",
