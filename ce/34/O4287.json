It is an example of Apsley Pellatt's so-called 'Anglo-Venetian' glass.\n\nPeople\nApsley Pellatt IV (1791-1863) of the Falcon Glassworks, Blackfriars, London, was one of the chief innovators of the mid-19th century British glass industry.  He learned about the historical techniques of glass-making by travelling about Europe viewing continental methods at first hand, and by rigorous experimentation.  His Curiosities of Glass Making (1849) became an invaluable manual for his glass-making contemporaries.\n\nHistorical Associations\nPellatt won a prize medal at the Great Exhibition, where he displayed cut glass services, 'Anglo-Venetian' gilt and frosted glass, 'cameo-incrustations' (now called sulphides) and even lanterns and medical bottles.  His two main exhibition pieces were a 24 foot high cut glass chandelier for 80 lights and an 'Alhambra-style' red, white and blue chandelier.  John Tallis in his History and Description of the Crystal Palace (1852) declared Pellatt's work 'second to none in excellence or beauty'.",
