The two central ones, wearing helmets, engage with swords; on the left a third wields a big club in both hands; on the right a fourth lifts his helmet. The two on the right bear shields charged with (a) four pales (for Aragon?) (b) six bezants. On the rim are four monsters (one broken away) giving the whole a rectangular form.

Although Paris was the main centre of production, other workshops emerged in Italy and Germany. Some of the craftsmen may have been trained in Paris as their work often combines French and local styles. They produced mirror-cases, combs and gravoirs (hair parters), often selling them as sets in leather dressing cases. Subjects from romance literature appeared frequently, as did the allegorical Siege of the Castle of Love.\nIvory combs, together with mirror cases and gravoirs for parting the hair, formed an essential part of the trousse de toilette or  \u00e9tui (dressing case) of the typical wealthy lady or gentleman in the Gothic period.",
