These scenes are repeated across the lid. The lower part of the casket shows assorted scenes of beasts and the hunt; a man sitting astride a lion, a gentleman hawking, a knight on foot and another on horseback both confronting dragons and a woman with a dragon on a leash. The sheet brass has been roughly cut and is damaged in many places. The casket's lock and handle are 19th century additions. There is also evidence of restoration and repair. One of the hinges has been reinforced.  The metal from one side of the lid is missing.\n\nM.71-1873 is a more heavily restored example, which matches exactly the iconography of the scenes upon the lid of this casket.",

Motifs such as the man hawking and a woman crowning her lover are common scenes of romance found on all types of artistic media including ivory mirror cases and caskets. The lady knighting a man and pointing an arrow (of love?) towards a man are less common. Other scenes, such as knights fighting dragons are more closely associated with themes of chivalry.",
