            "public_access_description": "The term \u2018Macaroni\u2019 arose in the middle of the 18th century. It referred to wealthy young men who wore the elaborate style of dress that they had seen during their \u2018Grand Tour\u2019 of Europe. In the 18th century many noblemen and gentlemen went on the Grand Tour to complete their education. The aim was to see the great sights of Europe, especially those in Italy.\n\nThe name \u2018Macaroni\u2019 was probably taken from the Macaroni Club, a fashionable dining society that specialised in foreign foods such as macaroni. This watercolour may also be connected with the second use of the Italian word \u2018maccherone\u2019, meaning a fool. It is possible that the principal figure is Charles Douglas, 3rd Duke of Queensbury (1698-1778).",
