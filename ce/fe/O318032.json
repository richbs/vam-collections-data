The flowers are a variant of the rose/cross icon which has four heart-shaped petal, with the pointed ends towards each other, separated with a short cross - although in this case there is no cross but animals instead.  This panel is bordered with two lines. The upside down U panel had five groups of figures. Along the top are three groups - two figures riding marine monsters and in between these are two centaurs, with a raised hand, and a standing figure with a raised hand. At the bottom of the upside down U there is a repeat of the two centaurs and standing figure. The upside down U is bordered with a form of crenelated decoration that extends along the sides of the top, horizontal band.  The piece is stained with some holes.",
