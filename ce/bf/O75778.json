The wallpaper was produced to coincide with an exhibition held at the Museum . 'Liberty's 1875-1975' celebrated the centenary of Liberty's, the department store in Regent Street, London. Liberty's had originally sold William Morris's fabrics and wallpapers. Osborne & Little, who made this pattern, set up their wallpaper firm in 1968. Their range of wallpapers and fabrics has always included adaptations of Victorian patterns, as well as their own original designs. They have often used the collections at the V&A as a source of ideas.",
