He specialised in small genre painting under the influence of Jos\u00e9 Bernardo Fortuny y Marsal (1838-1874) he met in Rome and from 1881 to 1890 he lived in Paris where he achieved notable success. He died in Seville in 1903.\n\nThis painting is a fine example of Aranda's small genre paintings or tableautin, a category in which he specialised quite early and improve over the years.

Educated at Leeds Grammar School, and was deputy chairman of the London, Chatham and Dover Railway Company 1869-70.  Died Winslade, near Exeter, 7 December 1885.  Bequeathed all his collection of drawings, watercolours and oil paintings to the Bethnal Green Museum; they have since been transferred to the V&A.  He also collected engravings, Japanese vases and panels, and bronze and marble sculpture.\n\nHistorical significance: In this typically ironic painting of 1871 a group of washerwomen argue in a courtyard, while a dog and a child play together on the ground. The irony here lies in the contrast between the activity of the women, which implies cleanliness, and the untidiness of the courtyard, as well as the discrepancy between their humble status and theatrical attitudes. Similar small realistic pictures of the 1870s include <i>By the Cradle</i> and <i>The Bullring</i>, 1870, both private collection. His earthen palette is enlivened by touches of red.",

            "historical_context_note": "Jos\u00e9 Jim\u00e9nez Aranda (1837-1903) was born in Seville, where he trained under Manuel Cabral Aguado Bejarano (1828-1891) and Eduardo Cano de la Pe\u00f1a (1823-1897). From 1881 to 1890 lived in Paris, where he achieved notable success. He died at Seville.\n\nAranda's small paintings called <i>tableautin</i> belong to a genre which he appropriated from the Spanish painter Mariano Jos\u00e9 Bernardo Fortuny y Marsal (1838-1874) whom he met in Rome. Aranda adapted Fortuny y Marsal's style, known as <i>Fortunismo</i>, or 'preciosity', in which realistic subjects are treated with frivolity and irony. Aranda was Fortuny y Marsal's most representative follower in Spain, but his detailed execution and fine brushwork is closer to the style of Ernest Meissonier (1815-1891).\n\nPaintings of everyday life were popular from the 17th century in Spain, where Francisco Pacheco in his <i>Arte de la pintura</i> (1649) called the naturalistic genre scenes of Diego Vel\u00e1zquez (1599-1660) 'bodegones', from the name of a rough public eating-place ('bodegon' in modern Spanish means 'still-life'). The genre was further developed by Francisco de Goya (1746-1828). During the 19th century genre paintings emphasised social concerns, combined with a growing interest for the direct observation of nature and the rendering of light.",
