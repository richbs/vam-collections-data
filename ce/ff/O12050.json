The benefits of wokring out three dimensional objects on screen, however, were quickly appreciated and soon led to the wide use of three-dimensional CAD.\n\nFrom the early 1980s, Tom Dixon had been working with scrap metal in an ad hoc manner, welding 'ready-made' objects into furniture which had overtones of the Post-industrial look. The 'Pylon' chair challenges preconceptions of furniture materials and structure, making overt references to industrial engineering, and is an example of unusual, high-designed furniture.",
