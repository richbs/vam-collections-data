As she describes it: 'The threat of chemical attack on the tube haunts commuters as anti-terrorist squads rehearse their response in case of emergency. Headlines warn that terrorists may be plotting an attack, but most Londoners have no choice but to use the tube to get to work and take a philosophical \u201clife must go on\u201d approach... Major Gorman, the head of the anti-terrorist unit on the London Underground (owner of the original), requested that his name and rank be inscribed on the briefcase in the image.'\n\n'Marf' drew daily topical cartoons for the Evening Standard between March 2002 and August 2005, moving to the Londoner's Diary page in August 2003. The drawings cover key political and social issues of the period, providing a vivid and often hilarious response to the main news of the day. The Evening Standard is London's only evening newspaper, publishing up to five editions a day. In Marf's own words: 'The cartoonist needs to keep up with the rapid pace of event.'",
