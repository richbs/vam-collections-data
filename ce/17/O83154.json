Invented by William Henry Fox Talbot during the 1830, it was the beginning of the negative positive process still in use today. The photographer, Calvert Jones, was introduced to the process by a cousin of Talbot and by close friends who lived near to Jones in South Wales.\n\n.The huge wooden hulls of the ships dominate this scene at the old Bristol harbour. The stern of one ship and the prow of the other are visually fused together, linked by the dark taut lines of rigging and a brightly lit bowsprit, which protrudes almost into the hull of the adjacent ship.",

F Talbot's photographic discoveries in the late 1830s through Talbot's friends and relations who lived near to Jones in South Wales. Jones subsequently became one of the few Britons to produce a substantial body of calotypes in Britain and abroad. His work stands out in the early development of photography because of his ability to fuse his technical skill with the influence of his training as a watercolorist. \n\nJones understood the importance of textures and surfaces and the use of light. In this image a medley of taut ropes and timber, shadow and silhouette create a dynamic fusion between the prow and stern of two sailing vessels. This quay side scene of Bristol's medieval harbour captures a moment from a previous era.",
