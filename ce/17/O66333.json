While he worked in many media and genres, his portraits have enjoyed particular critical acclaim since Vasari first praised them. \nVittoria popularised the genre of the portrait bust in Venice during the second half of the sixteenth century, transforming it into the dominant mode of sculptured portraiture, and exerted a near monopoly on its production. \nThe culture promulgated by an avant-garde of artists, patrons and intellectuals in RenaissanceVenice allowed Vittoria's gift as a portraitist to flourish. \nThe demand for portraits busts coincides with the introduction of the classicizing busts in Venice, a genre in which Vittoria specialized. A portrait all'antica not only showed a devotion to the classical past, ever a status symbol among the Renaissance \u00e9lite, it also marked another stage in Venice's quest during the sixteenth century to invest itself with antique auctoritas.",
