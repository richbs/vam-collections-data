            "public_access_description": "Simon Benninck never travelled to England, but his daughter was one of a small band of manuscript illuminators (illustrators) who moved from the Low Countries to London in order to work for King Henry VIII. As the invention of printing gradually made both the manuscript and its illumination redundant, illuminators drew on the tradition of secular naturalism to produce equally exquisite small portraits. Thus the techniques used by Benninck in his illuminations are no different from those used in this self-portrait. A sloping easel was used for painting both portraits and more traditional subjects, such as the Madonna and Christ Child. Both illuminators and miniaturists worked by natural light and without magnification, although Benninck\u2019s glasses hint at the strain of such intricate work.",

Both are autographed and signed and technical examination side by side would be the only way of establishing which was the <i>ad vivum</i> portrait and which the repetition.  Technical examination of the V&A\u2019s version does not include the Gothic spandrels and thus must be identical with that included in a still-life painting by Frans Francken, dated 1619, now in the Rubenshuis, Antwerp (see S. Speth-Holterhoff, <i>Les Peintres Flamandes de Cabinet d\u2019Amateurs au XVIIe Si\u00e8cle,</i> Brussels, 1957, p. 69, pl. 9, 10).\n\n30 <i>Limner\u2019s tools and Materials</i>\n\nAs the woodcut gradually replaced the illuminated book, illuminators had to develop other lines, of which the portrait miniature was a logical development.  Benninck\u2019s self-portrait is important evidence of this phase and he was working producing detailed portrait miniatures in the 1520\u2019s.  Paul Wescher in 1946 published a portrait of a monk sitting in a room holding his prayer book and what very reasonably is an earlier self-portrait dated 1525, in the Louvre.\n\nBenninck has depicted himself, at the age of 75, tense, tired and hermetic-like seated at his work easel onto which is pinned the beginnings of a miniature of the Virgin and Child.  A window gives onto a view of a house and garden.  The form of the easel is of interest.  Set up on a table, it is slanted at the usual angle but has a series of racks built into it at the left for holding colours and brushes.\n\nAlthough this miniature belongs to the history of portrait miniatures of in the Low Countries, it is crucial evidence of the work of Levinia Teerlinc\u2019s father.  A comparison with Teerlinc\u2019s Catherine Grey (no. 38) reveals the same thing washing technique.  His daughter never inherited her father\u2019s powers as a draughtsman but she must be the vital link that binds Nicholas Hilliard in a line of descent from the Ghent-Bruges School.\n\nINSCRIBED: <i>Below</i><i>: SIM\u00d5 .
