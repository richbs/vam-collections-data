            "public_access_description": "During the early 17th century when katabori netsuke were first made, Chinese influence on Japanese culture was strong. As a result, many Chinese illustrated books reached Japan, often in the form of encyclopaedia. One of the most important was the profusely illustrated Sancai tuhui (Tripartite picture assembly), published around 1610. Such works presented an exotic mixture of fact and fiction that was highly appealing. Of particular interest were the illustrations of mythical people and fabulous beasts, such as the creature from yumin guo (land of winged-men) that hatches from an egg. This resembles what later became known as the Japanese tengu. By the Edo period (1615-1868), tengu were always represented as either long-nosed tengu or crow-tengu, such as this example.\n\nThe bird-like Karasu Tengu (a crow tengu, a mythical creature) is seen here emerging fully formed from its egg. It wears the cap of a 'Yamabushi', an esoteric mountain priest, whose human form it sometimes assumes in order to play tricks on people. It already has a facial expression that indicates both its mischievous and malicious nature.",
