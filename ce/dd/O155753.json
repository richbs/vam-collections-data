There are two raw edges.\nThere is a delicate outer border of long-stemmed diamonds; this is incomplete along the right hand side. There is a band of needleweaving either side of a broader band of embroidered diamons [each made of 8 triangles] on a pulled thread ground.  In each corner is a square containing an embroidered lozenge and 4 small squares.  There is a pointed triangular corner unit worked into an open mesh of needlewoven bars, some holes have a stitched infill.  Although it is irregular, there was an attempt to alternate a hole with an infill. Mid-way along each side is a squat, thick-trunked tree-like motif in pulled thread with overcast bars.  In the centre is an octagon of needlewoven bars in the same pattern as the  corner units.  It contains a small octagon bordered with reciprocal trefoils, a pulled thread ground and an odd embroidered design of leaves, star-like flowers and a lily [?]. the field between the corner units and the central octagon is embroidered with small 8-pointed stars edged with an inward-facing fine band of long-stemmed diamonds. The large octagon and the inside edge of the corner units have a narrow border in which embroidered reciprocal triangles alternate with sections of needleweaving.\n\nCotton thread: Z-spun\nEmbroidery Thread: white silk; 2S",
