As a boy, drew plants for his father's engravings for Loddiges's monthly <i>The Botanical Cabinet</i> (1817-33). Also made preliminary drawings for his father's <i>London and its Vicinity</i> (1820-34) which were used by illustrators such as Stanfield, Prout, Cotman and Callcott, and worked on John Loudon's <i>Encyclopaedia of Plants</i> (1829). Etched his own illustrations for <i>Shipping and Craft</i> (1828-9) and with his father for Views of the Old and the New London Bridges (1833). Evidently made preliminary drawings for Stanfield. Painted in watercolours until 1834, when, after one lesson with James Stark, a family friend, he was inspired to paint in oils. Exhibited mostly marine and coastal subjects; 130 at the RA between 1835 and 1879,115 at the HI 1835-67, and three at the SBA 1835, 1838, 1876. Elected ARA 1851, RA 1863. Travelled extensively in Britain and abroad, most frequently in France from 1833, Holland from 1837, and Venice from 1850; also Italy 1845-6, Spain 1860-61, Egypt 1874. His inherited interest in natural history led to membership of several learned societies, notably FRS 1863, and his publication of <i>Grotesque Animals</i> (1872). Also published <i>Landscapes British and Foreign</i> (1874) and <i>Leaves from my Sketchbooks</i> (1876, 1877). Died Groombridge, Kent, 4 January 1880; his studio sales were at Christie's 22 May 1880 and 11 March 1882. \n\nLIT: Edited transcript of the artist's MS Diary, National Maritime Museum; MS Ledger of paintings completed 1829-78 (referred to below as <i>Ledger</i>), RA Library;<i>Illustrated London News</i> 13 August 1864, pp 173-4 (with engr portrait); <i>Art Journal</i> 1869, pp253-5; J Munday 'E W Cooke, Marine Painter' <i>Mariner's Mirror</i> (Society for Nautical Research) 1967, vol 53, pp99-113); <i>Edward William Cooke</i> Guildhall Art Gallery exhibition catalogue 1970, information also kindly supplied by John Munday \n\n<b>The Cleopatra Cylinder Vessel</b> \n1294-1886 Neg 71022 \nCanvas, 87.6 x 137.2 cm (34\u00bd x 54 ins) \nSigned and dated 'E W Cooke/1878 br \nBequeathed by Sir Erasmus Wilson FRS 1886\n \nIn the <i>Ledger</i> under 1878, as painted at his home in Glen Aldred, Groombridge, Kent; no 'possessor' is listed. The diary records work beginning on the design on 14 January 1878, and on the painting itself on 7 February; on 2 April he was painting 'till dark' to complete it for the RA exhibition. Exhibited at the RA in 1878 with the full title 'The \"Cleopatra\" in the Bay of Biscay, on the 14th October, 1877, signalling the \"Olga\" to cast off the tow-rope', together with a quotation from Longfellow's <i>The Building of the Ship</i> (1849): \n\nStaunch and strong, a goodly vessel, \nThat can laugh at all disaster, \nAnd with wave and whirlwind wrestle. \n\nThe donor, Sir William James Erasmus Wilson (1809-84), an eminent surgeon, was an amateur Egyptologist who defrayed the expenses - about \u00a310,000 - of transporting the obelisk known as Cleopatra's Needle to London. The obelisk, which dates from about 1500 BC, the reign of Thutmose Ill, was sent as a gift by the Egyptian government, and is now on the Embankment of the Thames. The journey of the 180-ton obelisk from Alexandria proved hazardous; Sir James Sexton wrote in his autobiography: \n\nWe were homeward bound in the tramp steamer <i>Fitzmaurice</i> when we sighted, in the Bay of Biscay, what appeared to be some strange derelict, or possibly the carcass of a huge whale ... we found the derelict was really a huge steel case, ship-shaped, with the name 'Cleopatra' painted on it ... We took the thing in tow, two of my mates and myself remaining on it as a kind of prize crew, and got it into a Spanish port, where we left it for whoever could establish ownership rights ... We learned, afterwards, that the ocean tug <i>Olga</i> had been compelled to abandon the relic, which she was towing from Alexandria, after she had lost several men (<i>Sir James Sexton, Agitator</i> 1936, pp64-5). \n\nCooke shared Sir Erasmus Wilson's interest in Egyptian artefacts. Sir Erasmus is supposed to have commissioned the artist to paint the picture; however, he is not listed in the <i>Ledger</i>, and the painting was for sale in Liverpool (for \u00a3630) in 1878 (see <i>Exh</i>: below). What is presumably the same picture, with the title 'The \"Cleopatra\" Cylinder Vessel in a hurricane in the Bay of Biscay, on the 14th October, 1877, signalling the steamship \"Olga\" to cast off the tow-rope', was sold by the artist's executors at Christie's 11 March 1882 for \u00a3162 15s. The sale catalogue, like the <i>Ledger</i>, records that the painting had been exhibited in Sydney, Australia, in 1879. Cooke was awarded a bronze medal at this International Exhibition for this picture, and two others\n\nPROV: \tChristie's 11 March 1882 (150), bought Vokins for \u00a3162 15s; presumably bought from the dealer Vokins by Sir Erasmus Wilson, and bequeathed to the museum 1886 \n\nEXH: \tRA 1878 (330); <i>Autumn Exhibition of Modern Pictures</i> Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, 1878 (332); Sydney, Australia, 1879; <i>Edward William Cooke</i> Guildhall Art Gallery 1970 (13)\"\n<u>Vikutoria & Arub?to Bijutsukan-z? : eikoku romanshugi kaigaten = The Romantic tradition in British painting, 1800-1950 : masterpieces from the Victoria and Albert Museum / selected by Mark Evans</u> [Japan : Brain Trust], 2002. 185 p. : ill.
