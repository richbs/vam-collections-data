The combination was exploited by Albert Moore in paintings such as Pomegranates (c.1886) and by Julia Margaret Cameron in her photograph Enid (1874). Several of Lady Hawarden's photographs also use this pa1r1ng device, depicting her daughters beside Indian cabinets which she may have been given by her uncle Mountstuart Elphinstone or by her cousin John, 13th Lord Elphinstone, both of whom served as Governor of Bombay. This cabinet has been identified as a large travelling cabinet of about 1700, produced in the Deccan under European patronage, though probably not specifically for export. The materials are probably rosewood, inlaid with incised, lac-filled ivory, the decoration being derived from Indo-Persian (Mughal) sources.
