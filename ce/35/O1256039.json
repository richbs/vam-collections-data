From the beginning, the design of Steiff dolls leaned towards the comic and they were described as cartoon character dolls. In 1907 the company began to make a different type of doll. These were more hard wearing being made primarily of felt and soft stuffed. They had childish faces and, instead of having removable clothes, had bodies that represented clothes.\nDuring the years just prior to the First World War Steiff produced large quantities of soldier dolls most of whom were designed in a comic way. There were over 120 different types of soldier doll dressed in a variety of national uniform and representing all ranks. As the war progressed the comic and friendly look of Steiff soldiers became less and less popular and, with a decrease in the availability of materials, the company reduced production significantly.",
