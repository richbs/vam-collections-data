Instead of sewing each button and its corresponding loop in place, a length of orange silk cord was threaded through the metal loop at the base of shiny hollow brass or solid lead button (both types are used on this dress). Once the buttons had been strung onto the cord, it would have been easy to stitch the cord along one edge of the front opening, spacing the buttons at regular intervals. A corresponding cord was stitched to the other edge, forming a loop opposite each button. \n\nThe colour of these cords has faded but was originally bright orange and because the silk is floss (untwisted) silk, it was originally glossy and added to the shine and glitter of this dress.",
