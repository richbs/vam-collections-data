This dress is a ball dress for Act III and was worn by a member of the chorus.\n\nHistorical significance: Visconti's famous black and white production of Verdi's opera La Traviata, premiered by the Royal Opera in 1968 translated the action to the 1890s, taking as its inspiration the illustrations of Aubrey Beardsley.  The costume is an excellent example of period costume making where the costume clearly shows the period in which it was designed in its cut and fabrics, particularly the brocade and the sunray permanently pleated inserts.",
