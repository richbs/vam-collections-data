The amateur sculptor H. C. Hatfield Senior was praised in a Competition report for his skillful 'chasing', which is the modelling or patterning of metal surfaces. No information has been found on Hatfield. He may have been a member of the Hatfield's firm of bronze workers active from the 1840s, founded by John  Ayres Hatfield.\n\nDesiderio da Settignano (Desiderio de Bartolomeo di Francesco detto Ferro (c. 1428 or 1430 \u2013 1464) was an Italian sculptor active during the Renaissance. He came from a family of stone carvers and stonemasons. His work is influenced by Donatello, but very likely he was trained in the large Florentine workshop run by Bernardo and Antonio Rossellino.",
