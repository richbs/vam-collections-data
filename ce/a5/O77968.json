Glass urn-shapes and swags are framed by an oval mirror surrounded by coloured glass pastes, offering excellent lighting characteristics as well as the elegance of the 'Adam' style. No doubt it was destined  for one of the great houses of Ireland.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThis object represents the sucessful combination of Irish glass-making, British design and probably German glass-cutting, the contribution of John D. Ayckbowm. A rather similar signed example (in the Cecil Higgins Art Gallery & Museum, Bedford) bears his name. Ayckbowm was a glass-cutter of German extraction whose family had been established in London as early as the 1740s, later continuing as cutters and glass retailers in Dublin from 1783 to 1820.",
