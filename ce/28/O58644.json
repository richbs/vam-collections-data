By 1600, ceramic bowls in maiolica became increasingly popular for this purpose, and so woodworkers and turners produced wooden bowls in imitation, in order to keep up with the fashion. These shallow wooden painted bowls were known as tafferie di parto and were decorated with birth scenes. Some were based on Nativity scenes and others on scenes from ancient Greek myths, like the birth of Hercules, used to decorate this example. Like its maiolica counterparts, the outside of this bowl has been painted with a large arabesque pattern and decorated with 'grotesque' ornament based on ancient Roman decoration.",

Nevertheless the  choice of Hercules, the hero who overcame all adversities including strangling two predatory snakes in his cradle, as subject, would have been perfectly suitable. This picture depicts an interior, with a bed and carved wooden cradle that would have been found in a prosperous Florentine house in the early 16th century. These items help illustrate and bring to life surviving inventories, although precious few examples of such furniture survive today. The outside of the bowl shows the extent to which grottesque decoration was applied to domestic objects, as well as palatial ceilings and walls.",

When this work was acquired in 1875, it was described as being in the manner of Pordennone or Battista Franco. Birth dishes and Birth Bowls were mostly made in Florence, and this could date from Battista's years in that city.", 
            "historical_context_note": "In the 15th century, it was the custom in Florence to bring mothers who had just given birth various refreshments laid out on <i>deschi di parto </i> or birth trays, specially painted for the occasion. By about 1500,  painted maiolica bowls were becoming more popular: these were often painted on the inside with biblical births and flamboyant moresque patterns on the outside. So as to keep up with the latest fashions, woodworkers and turners produced wooden bowls, known as <i>tafferie di parto</i>, decorated in a similar manner. Most surviving examples, like this one, date from the 1530s.  They were originally often supplied with special cloth covers and sometimes proudly fixed to the walls of a bedchamber, as in the case of a certain Antonio di Nicolaio of Florence, whose inventory was taken in 1570.",
