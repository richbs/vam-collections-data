            "public_access_description": "This game was owned and played with by Samantha Lawson, b. 08/01/1978, and her brother Thomas b. 30/11/1974. Solomon's Key is a 1986 computer puzzle game developed by Tecmo and distributed in Europe by U.S. Gold. It is generally recognized as one of the most difficult games to appear on the NES. The player must overcome unlimited enemy spawning, challenging level designs, a countdown timer, Dana's fragility, and limited ways to dispatch enemies. In addition, it's easy for players to unintentionally make levels impossible to clear while playing them. Solomon's Key has many hidden items and secret levels that are hard to find which enhances the reward for playing. The ending slightly changes depending on which secret levels, if any, the player finds and completes. Tecmo was a Japanese video computer game corporation founded in 1967. In 2009, it merged with Koei to form the holding company Tecmo Koei, and was operated as a subsidiary and brandname until its disbandment in early 2010.",
