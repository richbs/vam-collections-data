In the late 1960s, they created psychedelic posters for many of the English bands of the time, and decorated and advertised Nigel Waymouth's King's Road boutique, Granny Takes a Trip. They also designed for concerts held at the UFO club and Saville Theatre, and for underground magazine Oz. Their influences came from the decorative and eroticised designs of Art Nouveau, combined with the melting rainbow colours of LSD visions and pop art inspirations from the post-war media; traces of Disney, horror movie monsters and comic book characters and can often be seen  hiding amongst the images.\n\nThis particular UFO club poster was designed for a relaunch after house band, Pink Floyd, became too popular to continue playing there at a price the owners could afford. Having played the first few Friday nights, since December 1966, they were replaced by Soft Machine as the regular band, with further names attracted by the reputation of the club.",
