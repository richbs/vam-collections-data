The artwork is similar in colour and design to the album cover, but adjusts the wording so that 'Here's the Sex Pistols' is replaced by 'We Stock Sex Pistols'. The title caused trouble on release, with many papers refusing to print the word 'bollocks', and the owner of one record shop in Nottingham was prosecuted for indecent advertisement under an 1889 Act.\n\nJamie Reid's (b. 1947) cut-and-paste aesthetic developed from his interest in radical politics. His artistic style developed while at art college in Croydon, where he was influenced by the ideas of the avant-garde political group, the Situationist International. The political slant to his art was aroused by the May 1968 Paris student riots, which inspired fraternal protests organised by Reid at the Croydon College of Art. These were directed with fellow student Malcolm McLaren (1946-2010), later to become the manager of the Sex Pistols.",
