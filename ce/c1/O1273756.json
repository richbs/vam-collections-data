Robson performed as Jem Bags at the Olympic Theatre in May 1856.\n\nFrederick Robson was the stage name of  Thomas Robson Brownhill, an actor and ballad-singer who first appeared in London at the Grecian Theatre in 1844 and went on to become the mainstay of the Olympic Theatre after 1850. As well as being its star performer, Robson took over the management of the Olympic in 1857 in association with William Emden, and ran it until his death in 1864.",
