Its floor-show was written by the club's owner, Helen O'Brien, taking ideas from a wide range of sources, from popular song to Shakespeare; while based on the traditional showgirls, all leg and, at that time, topless, the references and wit of the designs of Ronald Cobb combined into a sophisticated entertainment.  \nThis design was part of a sequence accompanying the song \"On the Wrong Side of the Tracks\", and represented various symbols of success - in this case jewellery.  The design is interesting in that, when the arms are down, the white cloak hides the nude body but when outstretched, the front and back are revealed as transparent panels, while the large ovals of the necklace emphasise the bare breasts.",
