They were used in the 17th century as part of the elaborate 'passementerie', or trimmings, put on to bed hangings and chair covers by upholsterers. This tassel was made in matching larger and smaller versions.\n\nMaterials & Making\nSince the purpose of tassels like these was to enhance the visual effect of furniture and hangings they were usually made in eye-catching materials, such as gold and silver thread or brightly-coloured silks. Contrasts in pattern and texture were achieved by building up layers, sometimes on a wooden core, and sometimes with an elaborate wire structure, as here. The significant value of such tassels as costly items in their own right meant that they were often specified in inventory descriptions of furniture.",
