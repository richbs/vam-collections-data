The black outlines and solid blocks of colour of this design suggest a study of Greek vase painting. A slightly amended version of this design was produced as a wallpaper two years later by Jeffrey & Co.\n\nPeople\nWalter Crane (1845-1915) was the first President of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society. He excelled in flat pattern design and worked for many different manufacturers. He began designing wallpapers in 1874, after his name was suggested to Metford Warner, the director of Jeffrey & Co., by the designer, Bruce Talbert. He subsequently became one of Jeffrey & Co.'s most important designers.\n\nDesign & Designing\nWalter Crane developed his figurative style through illustrating books, for which he was most famous. In his illustrated children's books of the 1870s, the clever drawings and brilliant colour sense made his work popular with children and adults alike, and they are still in print 130 years later. Typically, Crane's wallpaper designs were figurative, and often narrative, drawing on Greek myth, fairy tales and nursery rhymes. This design has a formality based on heraldic design combined with a naturalistic and pictorial theme. It is typical of Crane's style in the 1870s.",
