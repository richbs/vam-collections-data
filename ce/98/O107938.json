Here, the viewer\u2019s eye is drawn to sunlit snow-covered mountains in the distance. Bourne writes about the difficulty of photographing this landscape: 'In taking views of snow, unless you get broad masses of it well lit up by the sun, it does not \"come out\" in the photograph with that purity which conveys the impression of snow.\u2019",
