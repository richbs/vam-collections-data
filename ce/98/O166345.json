The full title of the journal, Repository of arts, literature, commerce, manufactures, fashions, and politics, indicates the scope of its articles and illustrations.\n\nThis aquatint shows the front elevation of the brand new Covent Garden Theatre from Bow Street. The previous Covent Garden Theatre had burned down on the night of 30 September 1808, with 23 firemen losing their lives. The splendid new theatre, designed by the architect Robert Smirke, was rebuilt in only eight months and opened on 18 September 1809. The publication of this image in Ackermann's Repository in the October issue was clearly very topical.",
