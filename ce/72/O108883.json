Shah Jahan called it the Masjid-i Jahannuma, or the World displaying Mosque. \n\nVisible in this photograph are the steep high steps leading to the gateway and into the central courtyard of the mosque. The steps are on this, the southern side, as well as the east and north sides. The most impressive part of the mosque is the prayer hall, on the western side. The minarets and domes of this prayer hall can be seen on the left hand side of this photograph.",

The most impressive part of the mosque is the prayer hall on the western side. Its minarets and domes can be seen on the left-hand side of this photograph. \n\nThe Italian-born British photographer Felice Beato travelled through India documenting the aftermath of the so-called \u2018Mutiny' or 1857 uprising of the Indian army. He took photographs of the sites associated with it. The Masjid was probably the most conspicuous landmark in Delhi. After its capture by the British, it remained as an unused mosque until 1862. There was even a suggestion that the mosque be demolished and a cathedral built in it place.",
