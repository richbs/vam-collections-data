Philip II of Spain wore a ring set with a stone to protect him against haemorrhages whilst Elizabeth I owned a ring having the virtue 'to expel infectious airs' (Scarisbrick, p.55). Amongst the substances held to have curative values are toadstones, particularly popular in England in the Renaissance and whose use persisted into the eighteenth century. \n\n\n'Serpents' eye' , ie. the fossilised tooth of a Sargus (white sea bream) fish.  This gem has been catalogued as 'toadstone' (fossilised tooth of Lepidote fish), but toadstone has a characteristic brown/grey colour.  This particular specimen is orange, though having a similar growth structure to the toadstones in the V&A's collection (ie. semi-opaque, granular growth structure radiating from the centre of the form and graduating to a wavy pattern around the edges [viewed under high magnification]).  The refractive index measures approx. 1.58 (distant vision).  A second opinion from a specialist at the Natural History Museum would be useful.\n\nThe serpents' eye is commonly mistaken for toadstone.\n\nThe following is an extract from the Natural History Museum Website, taken on the 09/11/06\n(www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/earth/fossils/fossil-folklore/fossil_types/fish_teeth.htm)\n\nSerpents' eyes\nMiocene fossil teeth of another bony fish - 'Sargus', the white sea bream, and its relatives - were known as serpents' eyes in Malta. The palatal teeth of Sargus resemble Lepidotes teeth. They often have a pale yellow or orange-coloured centre called the acrodin cap, surrounded by a darker ring, coloured brown, giving them an eye-like appearance. Along with tonguestones (sharks' teeth), serpents' eyes were given as gifts in Malta during medieval times (Zammit-Maempel 1989). For instance, papal delegates to Malta were presented with gold-mounted serpents' eyes and fossil sharks' teeth to be used as protective amulets. \nTheir importance and value also extended to royalty - serpents' eyes were listed among the jewels owned by King Henry V of England (Thompson 1932). \nThe idea that Sargus teeth were the petrified eyes of serpents is connected with the story of St Paul. The snakes cursed by the shipwrecked apostle are said to have lost their eyes, which then became embedded in the island's rocks. \nThe use of serpents' eyes as a sympathetic medicine against snakebites involved either boiling the fossil fish teeth in water, or adding the teeth in powdered form to water or wine (Worm 1686). \n\nReferences\nThompson, C.
