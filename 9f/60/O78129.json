Cut-paper work was a common pastime from the late 17th century, practised by the grandest in the country, from Queen Anne to Queen Victoria, while also being a folk art.  Cut-paper work required time, patience and skill in the use of small scissors, knives and even pins.  Devotional pieces such as this were popular, as were landscapes and flower arrangements.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThis example is made up of two pieces of cut-paper work. One is the oval piece of paper out of which the Prayer has been cut, probably using a small knife.  The oval has been ruled in order to guide the artist in the size of the letters.  The artist probably mis-cut the 'K' in 'Kingdom come', for a single cut letter 'K' has been stuck in from behind.  Once the cutting of the letters was perfect, the oval was glued to the decorative border, which had been cut separately.\n\nPeople\nThe work has been signed along the bottom in brown ink, 'cutt by T Hunter 1786', who was almost certainly a child.  The cutting of 'The Lord's Prayer' would have been considered an appropriate occupation for a child, concentrating a young mind on a fundamental Christian text.",
