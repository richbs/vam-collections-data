Prints such as this are sometimes called ukiyo-e, which means 'pictures of the floating world\u2019. This world was one of transient delights and changing fashions centred on the licensed pleasure districts and popular theatres found in the major cities of Japan.\n\nThis print is taken from a series examining 'forty-eight techniques of the Floating World'. The two women seem to be sharing a secret; perhaps the woman in the foreground (whose blackened teeth and shaved eyebrows indicate that she is married) has told the woman in the background that her lover is waiting for her in a tea shop. Images of beautiful women like this served as guides to and souvenirs of the faces and changing hair- and dress-styles of the women who worked in the pleasure quarters.",
