Kilns appeared in all parts of China, each kiln with its own specialized products. Centuries later they were much sought after by collectors. A systematic classification of the different wares was already well established in the 1400s, whereby ceramics were named after the town in which the kilns operated. The best known wares are Ru, Ding, Jun, Yaozhou, Cizhou, Yue, Guan, Longquan, Jian, Jizhou and Qingbai. This piece is a Jizhou ware.",
