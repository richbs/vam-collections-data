            "physical_description": "[Drop-in seat] The oak side rails are tenoned to the front and back rails.\n[Armchair] Made of mahogany throughout. The seat rails are tenoned to the front legs and back stiles, the side rails secured with single small round pegs to the front legs and with square pegs to the back stiles. The back and front rails are not pegged. The back corner joints are reinforced with triangular mahogany blocks fixed with hand-cut(?) nails; the front corner joints with ogee-shaped mahogany blocks just glued in place.\nThe back stiles are tenoned to the top rail, and the splat is joined by a back-level bare-faced tenon to the top rail and by a front-level bare-faced tenon to the back rail. The back rail is shaped as though with a shoe on top, but in one piece.\nThe front legs have ears glued in place and nailed to the front/side rail above; they are chiselled quite fussily on the back face.\nThe arm-supports are tenoned to the arm-rests, and are rebated to sit over the seat rails to which they are screwed twice, the screws plugged on the outer face. The arm-rests are housed in the back stile (and may also be rebated, insde the housing) and secured by a single screw driven in from the stile and screwed on its inner/back face.\n\nThe front left corner block in the seat is missing, and only part of the front right block is still there; it must have been made in two bits, since the surface exposed by the loss is clean and not sheared.\n\nThis armchair appears to be a 19th-century reproduction, rather than an eighteenth-century piece inspired by Chippendale's design. The wood is extremely clean, and very pale where not stained; and there is very little wear. \nThe back of the chair is also extremely close to the engraving, with every detail of the design replicated.\nOther grounds for suspicion include the use of pegs to secure the side rails but not for the front rail (implying a wish to avoid visible pegs on the front face of the chair, which is not an 18th-century sort of preoccupation); the very small and circular pegs (at the front); and the ogee-shaped front glue-blocks (which are not apparently replacements for earlier blocks). The use of hand-cut nails in the triangular back corner blocks is overtly in the chairs' favour, but not conclusive evidence of an 18th-century date.\n\nThe relationship between the arms and the rest of the frame is ill-resolved, and the arms are rather short (from front to back).",
