Wallpaper designs were usually closely related to the styles of contemporary architecture and other furnishings. This wallpaper was made in the 1750s, and has a pattern of flowers around a framework of scrollwork motifs and vases -  typical features of the Rococo style at this date.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe pattern has been printed by hand, using wood blocks on high-quality paper made from cotton rags. Some of the colours were then painted on, using stencils. This is why some of the colours do not register exactly within the outlines of the design. There is a section of a border paper attached at the lower edge. This was made to match the design of the wallpaper. At this date borders were commonly used to give a neat finish to the rough edges of the handmade paper sheets, or to hide the tacks if the paper had been nailed to wooden battens on the wall.\n\nDesign & Designing\nSince wallpaper was first invented it has usually been designed to imitate some other kind of wallcovering. Printed paper was used as a cheaper substitute for materials such as tapestry velvet or silk. The pattern of this paper was designed to look like a silk damask fabric of around the same date.",
