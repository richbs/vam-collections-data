            "physical_description": "[Wrapping gown] Open fronted wrapping gown for a baby.  The waistless gown is made of cream coloured linen embroidered with cream coloured silk in scrolling and geometric patterns, and is edged throughout with buff coloured linen tape.  The upper part of the garment (except for the sleeves) is lined with a buff coloured fabric in a loose weave. The neckline is rounded at the back, with a bound slit at the true right side; it is angled at the front, with a self fabric shoulder piece at each side, ending in a round ended tab to pin to the front, adjusting the set and fit of the neck and sleeves.  The sleeves are cut wide, with deep-turn  back cuffs of self fabric: when the cuffs are unfolded, the curve of the sleeve and cuff together suggests that the cuffs were cut from the lower part of the sleeves and reattached.  The bodice effect is formed by a series of vertical tucks stitched down as far as waist level across the upper back and fronts.  The shaping and fullness of the lower part is achieved by the insertion of a triangular godet (constructed from two pieces of fabric) in each of the side seams.  The gown is open the length of the front, with no fastenings.\n[First shirt] Baby's first shirt, of white cambric trimmed with Valenciennes bobbin lace in an abstract scrolling pattern, matching that on the cap (Circ.210B-1923).  The shirt has a rounded lace-edged neck; each of the wrist length sleeves is gussetted at the armpit, gathered into the shoulder and self fabric cuff, and finished with a flounce of self fabric.  Each sleeve is open to just below the elbow, with the lace edging extending around the hem of the flounce and up the opening.  The shirt is open the length of the centre front, and would have fastened with removable pins; each cuff has a pair of buttonholes which could take a variety of fastenings including strings, pins, or linked buttons.\n[Cap] Baby's round-eared cap of white cambric edged with Valenciennes bobbin lace in an abstract scrolling pattern, matching that on the shirt (Circ.210A-1923).  The cap has a brim of double thickness fabric, and a back shaped with darts at the crown.  There is a drawstring for adjusting the fit running all round the edgeof the cap, the ends emerging on the inside just below the centre back seam.",

It was quite normal at this date to use pins instead - one reason why a pincushion was such a popular present to a new mother.  Using sharp pins to fasten baby clothes made it much easier to adjust garments to fit the growing child, but even then there were those who considered it dangerous.  The first printed reference in English to the closable safety pin (based on the ancient fibula form of brooch), is in 1857, but safety pins were not widely available until the late 1870s.",
