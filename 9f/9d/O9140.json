The personifications of Temperance, Minerva and the Liberal Arts reveal a familiarity with classical iconography and the use of such figures, on both metalwork and ceramics, can frequently be traced to contemporary paintings and engravings. In contrast to the more naturalistic 'rustic' ceramics, it is likely that in this instance Palissy used a mould taken directly from a metal proto-type. It is known that Palissy first used such techniques early in his career, in the production of 'm\u00e9dailles' moulded after bronze originals. This method was later applied to a wide variety of objects including candlesticks, plates, dishes and plateaux.\nPalissy-ware became extremely fashionable in the nineteenth century and craftsmen, such as Edouard Avisseau, produced extremely competent imitations, along with objects of their own design.\nObjects of this type were customarily commissioned for display purposes rather than use. This dish was inspired by Francois Briot's pewter 'Temperance' dish of ca. 1585-90 and   shows the close relationship between metalwork and ceramic design during the sixteenth century.",
