Thus the fabrics, cut and style of a theatre costume are at once recognisable as historical period and yet bear the signs of the age in which the production is being staged.  If the play was produced twenty years before or twenty years later, the costumes would be treated quite differently.  \nThis recreation of 18th century male dress was designed by Russell Craig for the Major-Domo in Richard Strauss's opera Ariadne auf Naxos for the English National Opera in 1983.  The costume reflects the formal nature of the character.  \nThe silhouette may perfectly recreate 18th century costume, but making it in D ralon clearly identifies the period in which it was made.  Dralon was a plush furnishing fabric much used in the 1970s and 1980s.  Theatre costume makers have always made use of furnishing fabrics which hang better and are more durable than dressmaking fabrics.",
