Full Citation:\n\n\u201c<b>105 A Girl</b> \n<b>c.1660-5</b>\nEvans 53 \n\n<b>Oval 64.5 x 52 mm</b> \n\nFeatures in brown and sanguine, hatched diagonally in blue-grey, with some white, and heavily impasted; black in the eyes (slightly gummed) with white lights; all on a pale carnation ground; hair in brown wash, hatched with darker colour and with gouache lights, also over the carnation; dress in blue wash, modelled with darker colour and with white lights; bodice in pale grey wash, modelled and with the lights in white; background a brown wash sparsely hatched with darker colour; on vellum put down on card (see below). \n\n<b>Condition:</b> Minor scratches, particularly in the upper part; the vellum removed from original support and put down onto modern card, which is heavily marked with laid lines, ironed through and defacing the surface of the miniature.\n \n<b>Signed:</b> Not Signed. \n\n<b>Frame:</b> A recent copy in copper-gilt, based on the original locket which is preserved in an altered state on Cat. No. 104 [Evans 52]; convex back, torus moulded sides; the hanger of D-section wire, channelled, and bifurcating into diminishing spirals off our turns. \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> As for Cat. No. 104 [Evans 52]. \n\n<b>Exhibited:</b> RA 1938, no. 842. \n\n<b>Literature:</b> As for Cat. No. 104 [Evans 52]. \n\nOriginally enclosed in the same locket as Cat. No. 104. The attribution of the two miniatures to Richard Gibson was by Long and has never been questioned. Stylistically and technically they are characteristic of Gibson in the early 1660s. \n\nAn unsigned note on the departmental record photographs suggests that the sitters were Gibson himself and his wife Anne Sheppard. This would have been on the basis of comparison with the Lely double portrait.(1) a photograph of which, taken when it was at Christie's, (2) is annotated in the same hand. The resemblance is considerable, but the identification is obviously impossible. Even dated as early as c.1655 (as at RA 1938), the miniatures would have to show Gibson aged forty and his wife aged thirty. But the sitters are clearly children and, on the evidence of the girl's dress and her hairstyle, which is suggestive of Braganza curls, the date is c.1660-5. \n\nAt this date, and if there is really a family resemblance rather than a formulaic childishness in the images, they could be two of the younger Gibson children. The sense of a family resemblance is perhaps reinforced by the similarity between the girl and the subjects of chalk drawings by Gibson, such as that in the British Museum, Signed and dated 1669. (3) Susannah - Penelope was born c. 1655, so would have been five to ten years old at the date of this miniature; she could therefore be the sitter. Her sister Anne, born c.1659, would have been ten at the date of the BM drawing. William, possibly born in 1644, would have been too old to be the youth in Cat. No. 104, but one of the younger brothers, perhaps the mysterious John, could have been the right age. \n\n1 Formerly Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth, Texas; Beckett 1951, no. 208. \n2 16 July 1943, lot 76. \n3 Croft-Murray and Hulton 1960, vol.I, p. 338; vol II, pl. 140.\u201d\n",
