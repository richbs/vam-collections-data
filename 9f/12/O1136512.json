It was only in production for two years, 1937 and 1938. It was one of Merrythought's novelty bears, highly distinctive and the most posable toy produced to date. Because it was only made for a short period of time, the Teddy Doofings bear is quite rare.\nAs the name implies, this bear could do a lot of things and was advertised with the following rhyme - \nHe can laugh, he can cry\nHe can sing, he can sigh\nHe can sweep, he can sleep\nHe can box and darn socks\nHe can play any way\nThis is an exaggeration but the malleability of this bear did mean that most parts of the body could be moved, including opening and shutting its eyes. It was made in a variety of colours, brown, blue, pink and green, with brown being the most popular.",
