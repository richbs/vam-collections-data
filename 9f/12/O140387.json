The carving is set within a raised fillet frame, approximately 1.2 cm. wide and does not extend beyond the depth of the fillet. The ornament consists of a ram's head at the base, above which is a horizontal tablet, supporting a gadrooned urn with handles with pendant rectangles, a narrow neck and everted, gadrooned lip with curling 'handles' to either side. From this issues a smaller, squared urn, supporting leafy scrolls and a further tablet.  The back of the panel is faced on the PR half with black, glossy paper.  Nail holes at the top and bottom of the panel indicate old display fixings. The panel is neither varnished nor polished.",

A great variety of renaissance designs was used all over northern Europe often in conjunction with traditional linenfold ornament.\n\nTo make a panel, usually a single split (or riven) oak board was used, and the shallow carved ornament created using chisels and sometimes a plane. The back of the panel would be left undecorated, and the edges worked all round to form a uniform narrow tongue. These thin edges of the panels were held in grooves cut into the edges of an oak framework jointed together. This method, known as panelling, was relatively lightweight, but also durable since the panels, not needing to be fixed with nails, were unlikely to warp or split.\n\nThis panel was formerly in the collection of Emile Peyre (1824-1904), a notable Parisian collector of French medieval and renaissance artefacts. In 1895 the South Kensington Museum (renamed the V&A in 1900), bought over 300 pieces of furniture and woodwork from him, (as well as sculpture and metalwork), at a cost of \u00a311,878. 16s. 9d.",

Peyre, it is recorded that in March 1895 C.P.Clarke negotiated with Peyre to exchange certain items of 'no educational value' for others more desirable. Peyre had resisted the Museum's wishes to pick and choose from the list. Once an agreement had been reached on the items M Peyre presented in addition two carved panels, 895 and 896-1895.",
