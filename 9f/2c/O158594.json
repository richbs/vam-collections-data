The whole is backed with plain weave cotton.\nThe main ground is pieced.  It is white cotton woven with widely spaced bands in red silk with a diagonal floral spray with flowers, buds or fruit. This leans to the right in one row and to the left in alternate rows.  In between each is a small upright stylized plant motif also in red.  The ground is quilted in a diamond lattice.\nThe border is down the left hand side and across the bottom.  Pieced.  It is white 2/2 cotton twill embroidered with red silk with slightly overlapping parallel wavy stems forming an ogival lattice in which the sides of the ogees overlap.  Along their length they are patterned in stripes: one contains a small pointed red blossom with green base leaves on a red stem which comes from the outline of the ogee and the other is divided into a small diamond lattice with a small disc where the lines of the lattice cross.\nA red plaited silk cord has been attached where the border is seamed to the main panel.\nBacking: pieced white cotton. The quilting is worked through this.  An unquilted piece of this fabric forms a band 13 cm deep across the top of the panel.",
