This shield combines the royal arms of England (three lions walking with their heads turned towards the observer) with those of France ancient (a field of fleurs-de-lis). This heraldic union, embellished with a label of three points ermine in the upper right-hand quarter, identifies the arms as those of John of Gaunt (1340-99), Duke of Lancaster and third son of Edward III.\n\nIn 1371 John of Gaunt married Constance, daughter and co-heiress of Peter I, King of Castile and Leon. In 1372 a great council in England recognised his right to the crown of Leon/Castile and granted him the right to bear these arms. John of Gaunt's arms are impaled with those of Castile (castles) and Leon (lions). \n\nThe complex political allegiances represented in this stained-glass panel required equally intricate painting and leadwork. Close examination reveals that no attempt was made to cut the glass round such details as the gold lions. Instead their outlines were painted in black enamel on roughly shaped pieces of yellow glass with the spaces between the legs blacked out. \n\nThis panel was possibly acquired from Strawberry Hill (Twickenham, Middlesex), home of Horace Walpole (1717-1797). Walpole, who pioneered England's 18th-century Gothic revival, transformed the property into a pseudo-Gothic 'castle' in which to hoard his celebrated collection of antiquities, prints and curiosities. His particular interest in heraldry was reflected in the Medieval stained glass with which he decorated his residence.",

Blanche died in 1369 and in 1371 Gaunt remarried to Constance, co-heiress to the Kingdom of Leon and Castile.\nEarly in 1372, Edward III and a Great Council recognised Gaunt's right to bear the arms of the Kingdom of Leon and Castile (by right of his wife). The crown was disputed and Gaunt was never able to realise his ambitions to actually possess the throne. In 1388 he relinguished his claim in exchange for a substantial sum of money and an annual pension.",
