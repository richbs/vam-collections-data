Above, two angels bear a small nude figure, hands held together, in a mandorla, representing the soul of the saint. Below is Christ, the Man of Sorrows, left hand raised, his head inclined to the left, standing in the tomb, his right hand held against his body under the wound pierced by the soldier's spear at the Crucifixion. On the left stands the bearded and tonsured figure of St. Peter, wearing a girded gown and a cloak and looking right; he holds a closed book with a clasp in his left hand and a key in his right. On the right stands the mitred figure of an archbishop, probably St. Thomas Becket, dressed in a girded gown and cloak, looking left; he holds a closed book in his right hand and a cross-staff in his left.\n\nThe cross-staff is damaged. The panel has been cracked diagonally across the middle and repaired. \n\nTraces of gilding are on the Baptist's hair and beard and round the edge of the mandorla. There is also black on the Baptist's hair and beard. Black paint is on Christ's torse, hair and beard and on the hair and beard of St. Peter and on the hair of St. Thomas. The centre of the mandorla is also black. The angels' wings are red and there is red on the folds of the garments of the two standing saints and on Christ's wound.\n\nThere are two lead-plugged holes in the back of the panel with the remains of latten wires. The bottom has been cut away.",

Above, two angels bear a small nude figure, hands held together, in a mandorla, representing the soul of the saint. Below is Christ, the Man of Sorrows, his right hand raised, his head inclined to the left, standing on the tomb, his right hand held against his body under the wound pierced by the soldier's spear at the Crucifixion. On the left stands the bearded and tonsured figure of St. Peter, wearing a girded gown and a cloak and looking right; he holds a closed book with a clasp in his left hand and a key in his right. On the right stands the mitred figure of an archbishop, probably St. Thomas Becket, dressed in a girded gown and cloak, looking left; he holds a closed book in his right hand and a cross-staff in his left.",
