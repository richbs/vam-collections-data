No. 189 [George Salting; according to a note by Long in the department files, Salting recorded in his notebook  (now lost) that the set was from the collection of the Duke of Leeds (presumably George, 10th Duke, b.1862);  bequeathed by Salting to the Museum, 1910].\n\n<b>Literature:</b> As for Cat. No. 189 [Long 1930, p. 93 (Anon.); Summary Catalogue , 1981, p. 70 (Anon., English?].\n\nThe Salting identification of this sitter as Henrietta Anne (1644-1670) (1) was not impossible on grounds of costume and date, but with the obvious unreliability on those grounds of the other identifications within the set, there seemed to Long little reason to take this one seriously. Accordingly, at least since 1924, this image has been labelled in the Museum as' alleged to be', or, 'supposed portrait of Princess Henrietta'. \n\nLong's formula - 'Probably by a French artist' - would have been based on the stipple technique of the face-painting, which was much more current in French practice than in English during the 1650s. But against Long's suggestion is the use of the table- book leaf to support the vellum, still a predominantly English practice at this time, as distinct from the French preference for copper discs as a secondary support. Furthermore, there is evidence that English miniaturists, particularly the Coopers, were responding at this time to the general influence of Franco-Swiss enamel painting (2) reducing the size of their ovals, brightening their palettes, and developing a gentle and minute touch, a variety of stipple, to create a relatively jewel-like and unpainterly effect. There seems therefore little technical reason to separate off this miniature into a different school from the rest of the set. \n\n1 For her image and a note on her portraiture see Cooper, Cat. No. 84 [P.110-1910]. \n2 See on this point Murdoch 1981, pp. 128-9.\" \n",
