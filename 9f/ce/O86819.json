            "public_access_description": "This caricature shows Frankie Howerd (1917-1992) as Lord Fancourt Babberley in Charley's Aunt by Brandon Thomas, at the Oxford New Theatre in April 1956. It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976),  a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years. Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nComedian Frankie Howerd became a regular on the popular radio show Variety Bandbox, first broadcast 1941, and in 1950 appeared in the Royal Variety Show, but he is perhaps most widely remembered as the hapless slave Lurcio in the 1969 BBC comedy television series Up Pompeii.",
