The altar is vested and set with a candlestick and candle. To the right two tonsured figures are in close and animated discussion beneath a rounded arch. On the back is shown a prostrate monk, stretched out horizontally but his legs still resting on the kneeler. He is connected to another figure on the right, who is gesturing with his right hand to the former. This is before a small building with steps in front and there is a square tower between the figures. Behind the standing figure is a heavy curtain gathered up to reveal a large chalice standing on an arcaded dais. There is a simple roll-moulding at the top of the box, but at the bottom the same moulding only extends across the back of the box. The lid is missing.\nThe box is carved in one without the need for a separate base plate. There is a square hole in the base perhaps to secure a later metal mount.",

They were probably used as containers for the host (the consecrated bread) and the material reflects their important function. \nThe unique narrative images at the box have challenged an acceptable interpretation of the subject matter. The narrative appears to represent a relatively obscure story. The narrative may most plausibly be interpreted as showing the use of a grand chalice by an abbot, the discovery of its theft, and the confession and prostration of the guilty monk before the abbot, with the hidden chalice finally revealed behind the latter.",
