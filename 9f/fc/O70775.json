He was the second son of Mian Kishora Singh Dogra, and the middle one of three brothers from Jammu who served the maharaja. He became chamberlain of the royal household in 1818, took part in military campaigns and was awarded many honours and grants of land. \n\nAfter Ranjit Singh\u2019s death, Dhian Singh became caught up in intrigues at court over the acquisition of power and influence. He assassinated Chet Singh, the most trusted courtier of Ranjit Singh\u2019s son and successor, Kharak Singh, who was then slowly poisoned. On the day of Kharak Singh\u2019s death the following year, his son and heir was also killed, leaving Sher Singh, Ranjit Singh\u2019s second son, to rule with Dhian Singh\u2019s support. Sher Singh was likewise assassinated, by another court faction, in September 1843, and soon afterwards Dhian Singh was also murdered.",
