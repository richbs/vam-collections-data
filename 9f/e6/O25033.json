It is one of the most complete replica models of the classic Gandharan monumental stupa (dome-shaped shrine), none of which have survived in a complete state.\n\nContainers for sacred relics were often concealed within stupas, and contemporary inscriptions confirm that devotees believed they contained authentic Buddha relics. Model stupas were also commissioned as reliquaries for the remains of eminent monks or Buddhist devotees. This example contained a small gold-leaf casket (Museum no. IS.299B-1951) which held bone fragments and stone beads.\n\nIt is constructed in three parts, comprising a square base, with a dome, surrounded by three umbrellas. Each of the four sides of the base depicts a seated Buddha being venerated. Each scene is flanked by pilasters with Hellenistic Corinthian capitals and an acanthus-leaf design border above. \n\nThe drum has two friezes. One has a stepped square design, the other a lattice-work pattern. The dome of the drum is decorated with an overlapping lotus-leaf pattern. A spectacular triple-umbrella, compete with a square section railing with crenelation detailing, completes the ensemble.",
