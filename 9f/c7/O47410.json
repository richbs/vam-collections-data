With stitch-work and applique of coloured textiles (partly painted) and sequins. The appliqu\u00e9 embroidery is in coloured felt. With cotton, braids and sequins, and wide a band of green cloth with brass rings along the top.\n\nThe central design has framed broad borders and the smaller panels consisting of scrolling vegetation, eight panels containing male dancers on hobby horses, and acheik textile patterns. \n\nFrom the left a lone male figure, in a long floral robe, standing on a rocky outcrop, watches a prince and princess who are attended by an umbrella bearer. They are dressed in sequined ein-gyi and acheik patterned hta-mein and pah-soe. The central panel shows a horseman, armed with a bow, approaching the gates of a city. Within, an official, in hat and long floral robe, waits to greet him. Behind him is a palace scene. In a pavilion, richly decorated with chandeliers and crystal drops, a prince seated on a raised throne and flanked by a pair of folded umbrellas is in conversation with a court minister, distinguished by his tall hat, and lady-in-waiting. \n\nThe figures are dressed in the fashions worn at the Mandalay Court ca. 1880.\n\nThe subject matter (unidentified) is from a Jataka story or taken from Burmese legend.",

Britain's control of Burma extended as the 19th century progressed, and the country was  annexed in 1885. \n\nA kalaga would have been used either as a decorative wall hanging, a room partition, or as a screen hung outside the house on festive occasions. The extravagant style of kalagas appealed to Burmese and Europeans alike and their popularity soared in the middle of the 19th century. This one shows scenes from either a Jataka story (a series of tales about the Buddhas former lives) or a Burmese legend. The costumes of the figures are depicted in the stylised tradition of Burmese theatre relate to the fashions worn in the Mandalay Court of about 1880.",
