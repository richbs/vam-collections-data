It is annoted Doubrovska? Pastorale.\n\nPastorale was an up-to-date ballet about making a film choreographed by George Balanchine to a libretto by Boris Kochno and music by Georges Auric. It was first performed at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Sarah Bernhardt, Paris, on 29 May 1926 Diaghilev had hoped to repeat the success of Les Matelots created the previous year and L\u00e9onide Massine choreographer of Les Matelots would probably have been a more appropriate choreographer of the over-elaborate narrative than Balanchine. Nevertheless Balanchine\u2019s inventive pas de deux for the tall Felia Doubrovska and rising star Serge Lifar \n\nThe subsequent design for the Film Star showing the final fringed dress is reproduced in the souvenir programme for the 1926 season at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Sarah Bernhardt, Paris, An alternative \u2018Henri IV\u2019 dress is reproduced in Boris Kochno Diaghilev and the Ballets Russes (1970) p.239\n\nThe costume is in the collection of the Dance Museum Stockholm",
