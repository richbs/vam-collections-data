This suggests that the silk embroidery was done and then the metal thread was added. The motifs are outlined with black blocks.\nBlue ground with a rigid pattern of large, multi-pointed 'gold' stars with a central light blue cross, alternating with smaller silver stars with a light green diamond. Between these two motifs are diagonal pointed cartouches with light green ground, a central lozenge and a tiny S- or Z-motif.\nThere are no end borders.  The border along the sides  has a red ground with a line of 'gold' stars and silver pointed cartouches with green 'leaves'.\nEmbroidery threads: 2S silk; blue, light blue, faded red, green, light green, dark green, black, pink.\nMetal thread: silver strip close S-wound on a white silk core couched with white silk and silver strip close S-wound on an orange silk core couched with orange silk.",
