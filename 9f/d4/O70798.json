Central panel of red silk decorated with couched two straw stalks plaits of various thicknesses, metal spangles (possibly originally gold-gilted) and metal wire in a design of a shield containing a crowned eagle with wings outstretched surrounded by strapwork and an outer border of scrolling floral stems. The straw decorated border is made up from three pieces quite unsuccessfully joined, with the joint hidden by a thick straw plait. This border is similar to the border of T.387-1921, two straw stalks plaits couched with yellow silk thread to ribbed red silk, and double-backed with natural linen and glazed red linen, strongly suggesting that the border has been cut from T.387-1921 in the late 17th century.\nThe panel is edged by a more recent border of peasant embroidery (satin stitch) - probably of 18th century date - with a design of scrolling and leaf flower stems embroidered in white silk on a red velvet ground. As the inner straw decorated border, the outer border is made up of several pieces assembled from another piece.\nAll the different pieces making up the cover have been handsewn together with red silk thread.\nThe cover is backed with natural linen and reinforced around the inner border with glazed red linen. \nSeveral areas stained with candle vax and parts of the straw work have been re-applied.",
