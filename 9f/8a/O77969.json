            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nThis sauce boat is one from a pair. The other is museum number C.665A-1935. Sauce boats became an essential item on the British dinner table around 1720, when French-style sauces became popular. English ceramic factories often copied silver sauce boats. Mid-18th-century sauce boats were open boat-shaped vessels with one or two pouring lips, but later ones were often tureen-shaped with a central foot. Both types could require an underdish to prevent spillage.\n\nUse\nThe five main sauces introduced by the French were b\u00e9chamel, brune/espagnol, tomate, mayonnaise and velout\u201a. Gravies made from roasted meat flavoured with wine and other ingredients were also popular in 18th-century Britain. Other sauces had a 'roux' base, made by combining butter or lard with flour and broth or milk.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe body of this sauce boat was formed in a two-piece mould. These moulds were made from a master model of the shape supplied by a freelance modeller, in this case probably Aaron Wood (1717-1785). Freelance modellers like Wood first modelled the shape of the vessel in clay and then cast a set of hollow plaster moulds from their originals. They used these moulds to make fired stoneware versions of their designs, and sold these to pottery and porcelain factories.",
