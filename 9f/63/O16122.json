            "public_access_description": "A writing box such as this would have been fitted with various implements utilised for writing from an ink stick, water dropper, ink stone and brushes. To prepare the ink some water would have been applied to the well at the end of ink stone by the water dropper. The ink stick would then be carefully dipped in the water and then slowly but firmly ground against the rough edge of the ink stone. Seen as a careful and meditative process, ink preparation took a while and was finished only when the consistency of the ink reached the desired thickness. This left ample time for the individual to admire the box. \nThe interior of the box depicts Ebisu with a large sea bream ontop of his Eboshi hat. As the God of Good Fortune and Fishermen this imagery works well with the exterior design of  varying molluscs. To mimic the various forms, patternation and colouration of shells each molluscs is made of either in ceramic, horn or coral. The red woven patternation of the background is striking and draws the eye to the dramatic hues of the shells. Its woven appearance is also suggestive of a fishing basket.  \nThis type of lacquerware with a painted bamboo weave pattern had its origins during the Nara period (710-784) and examples can be found in the Shosoin Treasury of the Todaiji Temple. Due to the red lacquer coating of the weave appears vibrant and visibly highlights the geometric pattern of the design.     \nThe artist Ogawa Haritsu (1663-1747) was a devout Buddhist, great poet and famous artist. Born into a samurai family based in Kyoto Haritsu would study Kano School painting, literature and the tea ceremony. He was also a trained potter and would use pottery inlays, as seen on this box, within his works. His lacquer work was innovative in style and would combine numerous techniques and materials to mimic the textures and colours of objects, animals or, as exemplified on this item, fish.",
