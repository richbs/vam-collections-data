A production which was first produced at the Lyceum (English Opera House) on the 2nd July 1827. \n\nThis is the second violin part. The musical notation has been written in pen and ink and additional annotation in both pen and ink and pencil indicate the action which the pieces were intended to accompany.\n\nThis music comes from a collection of manuscript music relating to the 'Cooper Family', one of whom, Alfred Edward Cooper (1840-1901) worked as a 'Chef d'Orchestre'/Master of Music at the City of London Theatre and playhouses in South East England. Throughout his career Cooper collected and composed 'melos' to provide incidental music for Melodramas. \n\nMelodramas were a form of drama which was popular in the nineteenth century. They often featured a limited number of 'stock' characters: the hero, the villain, the heroine, an aged parent and a comic man engaged in a sensational plot featuring themes of love and murder. \nIn the melodramas produced in Paris, London music supplanted dialogue or, more often, augmented stage language, actors' gestures, and dramatic action, to evoke an emotional response or provide an aural signal of the true nature of a character.",
