In 1879  he played Dick Deadeye in the original production of Gilbert &amp; Sullivan's H.M.S. Pinafore at New York's Standard Theatre.\n\nHis son, William Thomas Davidge (1847-1899), born in Manchester but taken to America aged three, also remained in America where he was also a comic actor and was married to the actress Maggie Harold (1852-1907). This drawing depicts Davidge as Pistol in Shakespeare's Henry V. A collection of phoographs of the Davidge family and associated personalities is in the Harvard Theatre Collection, known as the William Pleater Davidge collection of photographs.",
