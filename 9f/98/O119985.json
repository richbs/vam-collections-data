They protected their wearers from bands of robbers. Swords were also used by the Tibetan army against the British invading force in 1904.\n\n This sword was found after fighting at the Karo La, a narrow pass in southern Tibet lying at 16,000 feet. The Tibetans had defended the pass by building a six- foot- high wall across it from which they fired on the British. It was only after Sikh and Gurkha troops had climbed even higher at each side to outflank the Tibetans that they fled, leaving the way open to the British advance.",
