It's one of those oriental designs that went on so late in Finland - dated 1814 and looking rather like an old Anatolian rug only rougher. It's a fine design and colour but alas there's a moth eaten patch wh wld have to be restored...' A response of 29 august from A.F. Kendrick to Eric Maclagan: 'I feel sure we should be glad to have the rug. We have one - got a few years ago with the help of an architect at Helsevgfors at a modest price. Recently efforts have been made to find a market at extravagant prices. Dr Sirelius of Helsingfors University is writing a book on the subject which will be illustrated in colours, so I don't suppose there is much need to extend our collection to any great degrees. Ours is dated 1799 and no doubt Fry's, of 1814, shows a different pattern. Why don't you go and see it? We will accept your verdict. Ours is shown getween the windows on the landing next to the Salting galleries.' (1924/5646)\n\nWhen accepted, it was noted by Kendrick on 5 September 1924 that 'I may safely assume that the donor will not expect us to give it a permanent place in the Galleries, since it is in holes and considerably injured by moth, but it will be useful for reference by students and designers.'",
