Barbadillo  wrote a computer program that enabled him to rotate the U- shaped forms within a grid, to produce a large number of  different formations. The set of figures in the top left corner of  each design, labelled 'Cuadro Numero' (meaning 'Picture  Number'), demonstrates how Barbadillo altered the numerical  values in the computer program to explore the relationship of  one U-shaped motif to another.  Barbadillo would then compare  the different outcomes in a larger sequence to decide which  image was the most successful, and should be developed  further.  By using the computer as a tool, Barbadillo was able to  process much larger quantities of information than would  otherwise have been possible.\n\nThese works were produced using a line printer, which was an  early form of impact printer. Like a type writer, impact printers  use force to literally stamp the ink onto the paper.  Print-outs  were restricted to black and white, and darker areas or shading,  could only be achieved by overwriting one character on top of  another.",
