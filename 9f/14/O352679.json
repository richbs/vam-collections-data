In September 2012 Jennifer Wearden, ex Senior Curator Textiles (FTF) saw a number of similar covers in museums in South West Greenland.  She saw three or four similar examples in a museum in Nanortalik.  They were rectangular with the maximum measurement being only about 24 inches.  The information on the labels stated that they were made by named local women in the middle of the 20th century.  A larger example, more like the size of the V&A example, was displayed as a wall hanging in a 1930s room setting of a well to do Danish family in a museum in the capital Nuuk. Greenland had been a Danish province.  Jennifer questioned the only available member of staff who said he assumed they'd originally have been made as warm covers, but in his experience they'd always been hung on the walls as decoration.",
