The severely plain form was usually complemented by a crabstock handle (shaped like a twig or tree branch) and spout.\n\nMaterials & Making\n18th-century Staffordshire teapots stood a better chance of surviving regular doses of boiling water when made of stoneware rather than earthenware. Salt-glazed stoneware, as here, was the ideal material, but after about 1750 unglazed red stoneware was much favoured, and later Black Basalt and various types of white porcellaneous stoneware became the favourites.\n\nTime\nBritain became the ally of Frederick the Great of Prussia, during the Seven Years War (1756-1763), during which Frederick achieved unexpected victories over the French and Austrians in 1757. This so endeared him to the British public that he immediately became a hero of the people. The Worcester porcelain factory made teawares with an overglaze black print of Frederick in 1757 and 1758, while at the same time Staffordshire potters mass-produced salt-glazed plates with moulded borders inscribed 'Success to the King of Prussia', as well as patriotic teapots painted with his bust in bright enamels. Teapots with similar busts of George II, and even of the defeated and exiled Charles Edward Stuart, were also produced at this time, probably by the same enamelling studio.",
