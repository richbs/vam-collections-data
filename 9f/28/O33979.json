This kimono is woven with yarns of indigo blue, yellow derived from eulalia, brown from onion skins and green produced by dyeing with eulalia over indigo. The name of the kimono, 'Ise', is inspired by the 10th century Tales of Ise, one of the most famous works of Japanese literature. In 1990 Shimura was awarded the title of Living National Treasure, Japan's highest accolade for those working in the field of traditional crafts.",

Indigo was dyed over the yellow for the green colour. All the plants except indigo, which comes from a specialist supplier, are cultivated by the artist on a plot of land near her house.\n\nThis kimono was shown in the 1988 Traditional Crafts Exhibition (<i>Dento Kogeiten</i>), an exhibition to which the artist has contributed regularly since 1957. The title 'Ise' alludes to a scroll painting by the artist Tawaraya Sotatsu (fl. 17th century) characterised by vibrant hues of blue and green.",

            "historical_context_note": "The <i>tsumugi</i> textiles of Shimura Fukumi (b.1924) speak of traditions of much humbler origins. <i>Tsumugi</i> is a general term for the sturdy plain-weave cloth that peasants throughout Japan used to weave for personal use from silk obtained from wild cocoons or from the spoiled leftovers of cultivated silk production. Designs were executed in the form of stripes, checks or <i>kasuri</i> and the cloth had a distinctively nubbled texture resulting from irregularities in the hand-spun floss silk yarns. Indigo blue was the predominant colour.\n\nWidely recognised as one of Japan's leading textile artists, Shimura Fukumi was appointed a Living National Treasure in January 1990.",
