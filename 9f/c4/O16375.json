Although his starting point might be a natural object or an aspect of the landscape, he developed the symbolic imagery of his subject almost to abstraction. This watercolour, a version of an oil painting of the same title, is one of a series inspired by a poem by William Blake which begins: \n\nAh, Sunflower! Weary of Time\nThat countest the steps of the Sun; \nSeeking after that sweet golden clime \nWhere the traveller's journey is done\u2026\n \nThe poem explores the relationship between the summer sun and the flower that turns to follow it, and later compares the Sun to an ideal object of human desire. Nash here uses the black centre of the flower, a mass of dark seeds, to represent the Sun's eclipse.",

Nash wrote of this painting ' ... a shaft of sunlight breaking through the cloud falls across the form of a giant sunflower bowed by the wind ... the drama of the event, which implies the mystical association of the sunflower and sun, is heightened by the two opposing eclipses ... ' He also compared the composition to that of <i>Pillar and Moon</i>, a painting completed in the same year, now in the Tate Gallery.\n\n<i>The Eclipse of the Sunflower</i> and <i>Solstice of the Sunflower</i> followed in 1945, and a water-colour <i>The Sunflower Rises</i>, in 1946, but Nash did not live to paint the oil for which the last was a study, or to complete the final statement of his theme, which was to have been <i>The Sunflower Sets</i>. \n\nThe sun and moon symbolism, and the death of the gods during an eclipse is linked to the prehistoric ritual of the temples of Stonehenge and Avebury, and the presence of those giant megaliths in the Wiltshire landscape which fascinated the artist and inspired the dominant motifs of many of his works.\n\nJean Hamilton\"\n<u>Vikutoria & Arub?to Bijutsukan-z? : eikoku romanshugi kaigaten = The Romantic tradition in British painting, 1800-1950 : masterpieces from the Victoria and Albert Museum / selected by Mark Evans</u> [Japan : Brain Trust], 2002. 185 p. : ill.
