Since private workshops in Suzhou, Yangzhou and other centres carried out commissions for the court it is likely that the fashion for Moghul carving became more widespread.  The fashion continued into the nineteenth century.  \nThe decoration on this bottle is strikingly similar to that seen on ceramic 'medallion' bowls dating from the Daoguang period (1821-1850).  In shape and layout it is similar to the porcelain bottle from Captain Colvile's watercolour album of items sent back to England from China between 1857 and 1860. The coincidence of these features suggests that it was made during the Daoguang period.",
