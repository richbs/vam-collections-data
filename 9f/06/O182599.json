Traces of an older backing of plain weave resist and block printed cotton.\nYellow ground with a main border on 4 sides containing a light green meander bearing large spiky full red blossoms and lobed buds in crimson, with serrated green leaves.  This is edged with an inner and outer border of a double green meander bearing alternate round or slightly pointed red blossoms. The central section has a lobed roundel in the centre formed by a green and red striped band.  There is a red flower in the centre enclosed with an 8-pointed star which links 8 large red flowers with green details: a full flower alternating with one in profile.  A pair of serrated green leaves and a small trefoil flower emerge from the top of each of these red flowers. A quarter of this roundel appears in each corner of the central field.  On each of the central roundel lobes and at the corner units a pair of red birds between a stylized red leaf form, all with green details. The ground is decorated with irregular offset rows of red floral sprigs, a large and small one alternating.  These all bend to the left in the lower half and in the upper half the pattern is reversed so that the flowers point to the central lateral axis. The whole ground has been quilted with yellow silk in a small square pattern.\nNote: the floral motifs were embroidered before the quilting was done. \nBacking: pieced; broad stripes in dark pink or beige patterned with isolated poppy motifs in dark pink, green and blue separated by a linked longitudinal row of elaborate medallions alternating with squares and lozenges, predominantly in browns, green and pink. There is evidence of an older backing which is light pink cotton with small red pomegranates and green leaves.\nFringe: green silk looped fringe from a woven heading.",
