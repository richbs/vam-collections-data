Design for an altar with an arched frame decorated with four niches containing saints Inscribed below the niches in a late 15th century hand 'Storia di Sco pieto (top left). Storia di Sco Johans (top right). Storia di sco (bottom left). Storia di ... ' (bottom right) Pen and ink and wash over pencil 19 X 13t (483 X 333) 4904 PROVENANCE Giorgio Vasari (?); Dr H. Wellesley (sale, Sotheby, 3 July 1866, 8th day, lot 1439, bought by J. C. Robinson for the Museum) LITERATURE Reitlinger, p .\u2022 6 (where it is incorrectly referred to as no. 4902, instead of 4904); Otto Kurz, 'Giorgio Vasari's Libro de' Disegni' in OMD, 11, 1937, pl. 4; the same, 'A Group of Florentine Drawings for an Altar' in <i>Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes</i>, 18, 1955, pp. 35-43; Gigetta Dalli Regoli, 'Problemi di grafica crediana' in <i>Critica d'Arte</i>, 12, 1965, no. 76, pp. 25-45 See no. 2 above for a discussion of the problem of classifying this and a group of related drawings. This is 'Design B' in Dr Kurz's account of the drawings. The saints represented are St Peter and St John the Baptist (above); and a bishop, probably St Zenobius, and St Francis (below). Parts of the drawing have been torn away on the right side, and it has been repaired by laying it down on another sheet of paper and drawing in the missing lines. There is a horizontal crease from folding halfway up, and the paper is a good deal stained and foxed all over.",
