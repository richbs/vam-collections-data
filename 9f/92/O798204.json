It is part of a group of ten sheets of preliminary designs and working drawings for the ceiling of the House of Lords Chamber within the V&A collections. The drawing must have been made when working out the colouring of the ceiling of the House of Lords which was painted by J.G. Crace's men. It seems probable that the complicated series of patterns for the mouldings depicted in this drawing were not all executed. Certainly they did not survive on the ceiling in 1981.\n\nAugustus Welby Northmore Pugin (1812-52) is widely considered as one of the most significant and influential architects, designers and theorists of the 19th century. Following his conversion to Catholicism in 1835, he identified the Gothic style with Christian architecture and his work and writings inspired and framed the Gothic Revival. In 'Contrasts', published in 1836, he condemned classical forms and ardently praised 14th and 15th-century architecture. Pugin is best remembered for his work on the Palace of Westminster.",
