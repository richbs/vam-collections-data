The measurements are die-stamped on the diameter and circumference, along with details of patents (a government grant of exclusive privilege for the making or selling of a new invention).\n\nPeople\nThe polygraph was an American invention patented by the Polygraph Company, Philadelphia, USA, on 8 December 1885. A licence was granted  the following year to George Delgado for the manufacturing of the polygraph in Europe.\n\nOwnership & Use\nThe polygraph was advertised by the manufacturers as 'A Revolution in Drawing' and was aimed at designers, decorators, draughtsmen, architects, engineers and artisans. It was also described as an invention by which schoolchildren and even 'a child of few years' could 'produce drawings, which formerly required long months of study and preparation'. The polygraph offers an element of surprise in the unpredictable patterns it creates. It also helps to produce an evenness and regularity when producing the pattern that would be difficult to achieve freehand. The circular metal template was accompanied by a set of instructions and a sheet of examples showing the type of designs that could be produced with the instrument.",
