It is here that we start to see the boundaries blur between adult and child, as both children and adults share the same products and social networking sites.   \n\nResearch by Child Net International shows, that 60% of secondary school children and 20% of primary school children own a mobile phone.  There has been a lot of public debate about children using mobile phones, due to heath risk as well as the potential for miss-use.  The market has responded to the demand for mobile phones for children and there is now a range available.  The phones aimed at younger children are designed to limit risk, such as Teddyfone.  It does not have a screen and has 4 numbers programmed into it, this reduces the risk of miss use, from text, or image messaging, downloading unsuitable content.  It also makes it less attractive and unlikely to be stolen.",
