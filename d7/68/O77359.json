This involves roughening the surface of a metal plate and then selectively smoothing it down to create the highlights on the print. The plate is then inked and the ink held in the indentations transferred onto a sheet of paper.\n\nPeople\nChauncey Hare Townshend (1798-1868) was a wealthy gentleman and an avid traveller, and was keenly interested in the arts. He was described by The Times on his death as 'a collector of rare judgement and exquisite taste'. During his lifetime he built up a  large and varied collection which included paintings, prints, photographs, drawings, books, gemstones, cameos and intaglios.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThis print is a portrait of the sculptor John Flaxman (1755-1826), the most famous English Neo-classical sculptor of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. He specialised in producing monumental sculpture and became noted for the piety and humanity of his church monuments.",
