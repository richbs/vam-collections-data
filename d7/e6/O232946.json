            "public_access_description": "The inro is a container made up of tiers. From the late 16th century, Japanese men wore an inro suspended from their sash by a silk cord and a netsuke (toggle) because the traditional Japanese garment, the kimono, had no pockets. They were originally used to hold their owner's seal and ink or a supply of medicines. However, inro rapidly became costly fashion accessories of little or no practical use. Most inro are rectangular with gently curving sides. \n\nFrom the 1700s onwards, many artists signed the inro they made and this example is signed Shiomi Masanari. Although Shiomi Masanari (1647-ca 1722) was a talented painterof the Kano school, he is better known for his lacquerwork and the important family of lacquerers that he founded. Whether or not he was a pupil of Yamamoto Shunsho (1610-82) as is widely believed, the Shiomi family also specialised in togidashi-e ('brought out by rubbing') lacquer of extremely high quality. Successive generations mostly used the name Shiomi Masanari and this example was undoubtedly made by a later member in a different lacquer technique.",
