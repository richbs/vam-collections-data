Since 1969, he has been working as an independent photographer based in Vilnius, Lithunania. He was one of the co-founders and President of the Photography Art Society of Lithuania (PASL), which championed photography as an art form and is credited with gaining recognition for Lithuanian photographers on the national and international scene. Sutkus's main subject is man in all situations and moods. Amongst his most important work is his series 'People of Lithuania', a continuing project begun in 1976 which documents the changing life of Sutkus's homeland. His aim, he has written, is 'to make an attempt at drawing a psychological portrait of contemporary man\u2026.because future generations will judge our way of life, our culture and our inner world on the basis of photographs'.",
