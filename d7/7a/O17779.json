Vol. 4: Wiltshire, Somerset, Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Hampshire, Sussex, Kent. p.123.\n'The Admiralty, the War Office, and the Air Ministry composed their rivalries and, like the linked figures in an outfitter's advertisement, stood in united and non-cultural guardianship against recording in Hampshire.  They did not bar the whole county, and forty-seven paintings were eventually completed - a respectable total in the circumstances.  But from beginning to end there were areas - anyone can guess where they lay - in which the work of recording was impossible, as well as others where it was only just, or only sometimes, possible.\n\nThough, in fact, the group includes drawings made in all parts of the county except the vicinities of Southampton, Portsmouth, and Aldershot, most of the work took place inside a central and almost equilateral triangle, Petersfield - Odiham - Andover. It is a large triangle and, whatever the reader may feel, the artists suffered little from a sense of restriction as they worked their way through the lovely, unexploited villages so rich in character and tradition.'\n\n[excerpt from <i>Hampshire</i> introduction]\nPalmer, Arnold, ed. <u>Recording Britain</u>. London: Oxford University Press, 1946-49. Vol. 4: Wiltshire, Somerset, Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Hampshire, Sussex, Kent. pp.132-133, illus.\n'On 7 October 1941 there appeared in <i>The Times</i> a letter in which Sir George D. Jeffreys, writing from the House of Commons, drew the attention of the editor and the public to the siting of an aerodrome and the consequent threat to a famous avenue of trees.  \"The Ministry\", he complained, \"no doubt anticipating local opposition, kept their project secret until their plans were complete, and now say that neither an alternative site nor a change of lay-out is possible.\"\n\nThe same considerations of national security which had influenced the Ministry restrained Sir George from identifying aerodrome or avenue; but by the middle of the morning a number of people seemed to know that Lasham was the scene, and by the afternoon post a letter was on its way to the artist.  Before his answer came, he and his hard-working bicycle were well on their way to Hampshire.'\nMellor, David, Gill Saunders and Patrick Wright. <u>Recording Britain: A Pictorial Domesday of Pre-War Britain</u>.

On 7 October 1941 a letter in <i>The Times</i> from Sir George Jeffreys MP drew attention to the proposed siting of an aerodrome and the consequent danger to a famous avenue of trees. Hennell was offered the commission to record the site almost immediately.\n\nThe avenue followed the boundary of the constituencies of Basingstoke and Petersfield and the parishes of Lasham and Herriard. It was planted by George Purefoy Jervoise of Herriard Park in 1809, a premature celebration of the Jubilee of George III, due the following year. Though the trees of the mature avenue were remarkable for their beauty and uniformity, four-fifths were felled, leaving only two short lengths totalling a quarter of a mile.'\n<u>Catalogue of Drawings in the 'Recording Britain' Collection given by the Pilgrim Trust to the Victoria and Albert Museum</u> published by the Victoria and Albert Museum, Prints, Drawings and Paintings Department, 1951.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows: \n \n<u>'HAMPSHIRE</u>. \n\n[\u2026]  \n \nHENNELL, Thomas R.W.S. \n \nBeech Avenue, Lasham. \n<u>Signed</u> T.Hennell.\n<u>Water-colour</u> (17 \u00bc x 22 1/4)\n(Reproduced Vol.IV)  Neg.No.A.142.\n\nE.1532-1949'\nAnne Anderson, Tim Craven, Della Hooke.

            "history_note": "This work is from the 'Recording Britain' collection of topographical watercolours and drawings made in the early 1940s during the Second World War. In 1940 the Committee for the Employment of Artists in Wartime, part of the Ministry of Labour and National Service, launched a scheme to employ artists to record the home front in Britain, funded by a grant from the Pilgrim Trust. It ran until 1943 and some of the country's finest watercolour painters, such as John Piper, Sir William Russell Flint and Rowland Hilder, were commissioned to make paintings and drawings of buildings, scenes, and places which captured a sense of national identity. Their subjects were typically English: market towns and villages, churches and country estates, rural landscapes and industries, rivers and wild places, monuments and ruins. Northern Ireland was not covered, only four Welsh counties were included, and a separate scheme ran in Scotland.\n\nThe scheme was known as 'Recording the changing face of Britain' and was established by Sir Kenneth Clark, then the director of the National Gallery. It ran alongside the official War Artists' Scheme, which he also initiated. Clark was inspired by several motives: at the outbreak of war in 1939, there was a concern to document the British landscape in the face of the imminent threat of bomb damage, invasion, and loss caused by the operations of war. This was allied to an anxiety about changes to the landscape already underway, such as the rapid growth of cities, road building and housing developments, the decline of rural ways of life and industries, and new agricultural practices, which together contributed to the idea of a 'vanishing Britain'. Clark also wanted to help artists, and the traditional forms of British art such as watercolour painting, to survive during the uncertain conditions of wartime. He in turn was inspired by America's Federal Arts Project which was designed to give artists employment during the Great Depression of the 1930s.\n\nOver 1500 works were eventually produced by 97 artists, of whom 63 were specially commissioned. At the time the collection had a propaganda role, intended to boost national morale by celebrating Britain's landscapes and heritage. Three exhibitions were held during the war at the National Gallery, and pictures from the collection were sent on touring exhibitions and to galleries all around the country. After the war, the whole collection was given to the V&A by the Pilgrim Trust in 1949, and it was documented in a four volume catalogue published between 1946 and 1949. For many years the majority of the collection was on loan to councils and record offices in each county, until recalled by the V&A around 1990. The pictures now form a memorial to the war effort, and a unique record of their time.",
