            "physical_description": "Cut silk velvet backed with block printed plain weave cotton, faced with silk double cloth and trimmed with cord braid.\nThe velvet has been woven from the top of the design. There are two selvedges in twill and a narrow band of plain weave along the top and bottom indicating that the velvet was woven as a panel.  It is decorated with two bands of figures, repeated to give a total of six rows.\n[1] two seated musicians [flautists] wearing red robes and light green turbans are on either side of a small light green cypress tree which contains red flowers. This group is separated by a yellow tree in which there are two white birds.\n[2] a standing male figure in a red robe and yellow kulah cap with outstretched hands each holding a red fruit or flower. Between these is a naked figure [probably female?] on a slightly larger scale; it seems to be cross-legged but the feet are oddly drawn.\nAll the motifs are outlined in grey.\nFoundation warp: white silk; Z-twist.\nPile warp: white, grey, red, green, yellow silk\nWeft: white silk\nBacking: pieced; resist-dyed and block printed plain weave cotton.  Blue ground with two variations of a small flower and leaves in white and two shades of light brown.\nFacing: The backing is turned over towards the front and the facing is on the front.  It is made from many pieces.  It is a fine silk double cloth in plain weave. For a similar piece see Textile Museum, Washington DC Inv. No. 3.216 published in 'Woven from the Soul, Spun from the Heart' 1987,  cat. No. 70 p.267; thought to be 16th or 17th century.\nDiagonal stripes: there is a narrow stripe with a white ground and a small purple floral sprig and a wider stripe with a purple ground and two floral motifs: a sprig with three 5-petalled flowers on a stem alternating with a sprig with one flower and two buds.\nA twisted cord braid has been added on all four sides: it is made from white silk and silver-gilt strip.",
