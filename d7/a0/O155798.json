The inner and outer borders contain a green leafy meander with a red trefoil flower.  The main border has isolated inward facing floral sprigs with a red triangular base and 2 red buds and a large red carnation.  There is a pair of small floral sprigs, one above the other, between the large ones.  This border has a quilted ground with a scale pattern. The quilting is worked with white silk except in the lower right hand corner where it is a yellow-green.\nIn the centre is a lobed medallion formed by a green band with red dots; there is a red and green rosette in the centre.  A green 8-pointed star encircles this and links 4 large red blossoms in profile at the diagonals and 4, unattached, round red blossoms at the cardinal points.  A pair of green serrated leaves and a red trefoil emerges from the top of every blossom. On the outer edge of the lobed medallion there is a small red tree at every angle and there are four red birds around the medallion. A quarter of this design is in each corner.  The ground if filled with small sprigs with upright stems and 3 red flowers; these sprigs point towards the central horizontal axis.  The ground is quilted with the scale pattern.\nSome underdrawing is visible.\nBacking: pieced down left hand side.  White ground divided into diamond lattice by straight stems bearing small flowers.  Each lozenge contains one of about 6 different floral sprays, each with three flowers.  There is a single flower within an ogee of leaves at each angle of the lozenge. The colours are red, purple, green, light blue and yellow.\nFringe: looped green silk from a woven heading.",
