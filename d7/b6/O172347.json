            "public_access_description": "This silvered bronze medal depicts a steam engine and machinery, and dates from 1900. The medallist, H. Kautsch, was trained by his father, who was a goldsmith. He continued his studies in Prague, under Professors Popp, Mentzel and Schultz, winning prizes in 1876 and 1878. Afterwards he became a pupil at the School of Industrial Art in Vienna under Professors Schwartz and Koenig. He left Vienna to go to major art centres in Italy, France and Germany. He returned to Prague in 1882 and accepted a professorship at the Imperial School of Decorative Arts there. In 1888 he was called to Budweis to reorganise the Museum of Decorative Arts. There he wrote his work 'Goldschmiede Arbeiten des XV bis XIX Jahrhunderts' and founded a school for drawing and sculpture. In 1889 he settled at Paris. In 1893 he was a member of the Jury of Fine Arts at the Chicago World's Fair, and acted as the official reporter for Austria on the fine and decorative Arts.",
