            "public_access_description": "Miniature painting originally referred to the art of painting in watercolour on vellum (fine animal skin). It developed in the early 16th century out of the tradition of illuminating manuscripts (hand-written books). In England, miniature was predominantly a portrait art. It was practised by specialist miniature painters, such as Nicholas Hilliard (1547-1619). On the Continent, miniature painting as a portrait art had a few great practitioners, such as the French painter Jean Clouet (1516?-1572). But not even Clouet was a specialist. Like Hans Holbein, he worked both in miniature and in large in oil.\n\nThis miniature is by Andreas von Behn, who was born in Christianopel in Sweden in 1650. Behn was a specialist, known mainly for his miniatures in watercolour on vellum and in enamel on metal. He worked in Sweden from 1677 to 1710-11. In 1693 he was appointed Court Portrait Painter to the Swedish monarchy. We last hear of him in Vienna about 1713, when he was drawing a pension from the Dowager Queen of Sweden. He died in 1715.\n\nThe miniature is dated 1704 and depicts Robert Benson, 1st Baron Bingley. Benson became Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1711, and was Queen Anne's Ambassador Extraordinary to the Spanish court in 1713. The queen created him Baron Bingley of Bingley on 21 July 1713. He married Elizabeth, daughter of Heneage Finch, 1st Earl of Aylesford, on 21 December 1703. Behn may have painted this portrait when Benson was travelling on the Continent.",
