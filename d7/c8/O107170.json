To avoid persecution, many went to the new colonies in North America.  \n\nIn formal terms, Nonconformity began with the 1662 Act of Uniformity, which required priests to use the Book of Common Prayer and declare allegiance to Anglican bishops. Radical clergy and congregations refused to comply. Church leaders faced imprisonment, transportation or death.  \n\nBy 1700, there was greater tolerance so Nonconformism became more widespread. Its organisation differed from the Anglican church. Instead of bishops, Congregationalists were governed democratically by their members, whereas Presbyterians had elected elders. Methodism, which emerged in the 1730s, established authority in a conference of church members. Although Methodists accepted many Anglican teachings, some groups such as Baptists, Presbyterians and Independents pursued a very personal approach to religion, emphasising freedom of conscience.  \n\nPractising Nonconformity \nIn many Nonconformist churches, preaching the word of God took precedence over formal worship. Churches were centred around charismatic preachers like John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, or the Baptist leader Charles Spurgeon. However, dissenters did celebrate communion regularly. Some, like Congregationalists, took communion seated around a table. Others stood to receive it, or remained seated while church officials (deacons) distributed the bread and wine.  \n\nNonconformist communion plate was simple in design and often made from inexpensive materials, such as pewter, glass and ceramics. The earliest pieces date from the 1640s, and cups with two handles were a standard design.",
