They were probably mostly used for serving drink, though similar jugs in contemporary miniatures hold flowers like those painted on the jug itself. The jug betrays, through details in its shape, that it is copied from a metal object, probably one in gilded brass with engraved decoration. The 'torus moulding' bulge at the constriction of the neck is unnecessary in ceramics, but would hide a join in sheet-metal work. The sharply angled foot is also characteristic of metalwork. \n\nSubjects Depicted\nDesigns of tulips and other flowers became dominant in Iznik ware in the second half of the 16th century. They are also found in a wide range of other objects: metalwares, leather goods, book illumination, and woven and embroidered textiles. This reflects the Ottoman passion for gardens and horticultural pursuits at all levels of society. \n\nCollecting\nIznik wares, thanks to their brilliant colours and inventive decoration, became a passion among European collectors from the mid 19th century. At first they were believed to be Iranian in origin. This stemmed from the idea that the Iranians were the only 'artistic' race in the Middle East and that Arabs and Turks, whatever their other qualities, were essentially 'art less'. As evidence grew that these objects were not from Iran, more fanciful stories were invented to support an Iranian origin. Iznik pots found on the island of Rhodes in the Mediterranean, for example, were explained as having been made by 'shipwrecked Persian [Iranian] sailors'. It was only finally accepted that these pots were made by Turks in Ottoman Anatolia at the beginning of the 20th century.",
