What is An American? takes the form of a parfleche (literally \u2018parry arrow\u2019). This traditional Native American \u2018carry-all\u2019 is made from buffalo hide soaked in lye, dried, decoratively painted, then folded and tied. It also, symbolically, carries messages about origins, history and identity. \n\nIn this print Smith has brought together symbols of white America with those of Native Americans, alluding to the mixing of these two very different cultures. Made in the wake of the September 11 attacks on the USA, the work questions the patriotism exhibited by many Americans at this time. Claiming the right not to be violated by invaders and aggressors, they had apparently forgotten past violations of Native America.",
