            "public_access_description": "George Cruikshank was the son of Isaac Cruikshank, a maker of satirical prints, in whose workshop George was producing signed work by the age of seven. He went on to become a prolific producer of caricatures, political and social satires and literary illustrations.\n\nThe \u2018golden age\u2019 of satirical printmaking, dominated by James Gillray (1756-1815), Thomas Rowlandson (1756-1827) and Cruikshank (1792-1878), was between 1780 and 1830. This period coincided with the founding and development of the mass movements for the abolition of the slave trade and subsequent abolition of slavery within Britain\u2019s West Indies colonies. Unsurprisingly, then, slavery and abolitionism were themes addressed by many print satirists whose work featured black people in a number of social and political contexts.\n\nIn Cruikshank\u2019s early images black people are portrayed with some naturalism and sensitivity but increasingly, as the 19th century progressed, he turned to stereotype and caricature. This print responds to contemporary concerns about the threat of miscegenation in showing a group of perplexed-looking white men confronted by a group of leering black women with over-emphasised \u2018black\u2019 physical features. Their strangeness and \u2018African-ness\u2019 is further emphasised through their accessories which include ear and lip plugs.",
