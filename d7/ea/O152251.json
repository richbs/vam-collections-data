Curving blue stems form an inner circle of eight white ground heart-shaped segments each containing two red and 1 mauve flower and an outer circle of larger but similar segments with a light yellow ground. Sections of these outer  patterns are repeated in each corner of the central panel.  The central decoration is printed on top of a blue stemmed meander repeated one and half times on a white ground.  It bears exotic blossoms and  carnations and pomegranates and  pod-like leaves.\nThere is a series of borders:\n[a] narrow yellow ground with a blue meander and red and mauve flowers;\n[b] wide white ground patterned with a blue leafy meander bearing similar but larger exotic blossoms as in the main field;\n[c] a [a]\n[d] wide reciprocal white/yellow trefoil with blue stems, each bearing three predominantly red flowers;\n[e] as [a].\n\nThe backing is roller printed on a white ground with a repeating pattern of 2 different small boteh shaped floral sprays and one upright spray; light blue with red details arranged in off-set rows.  \nThe facing is bias-cut roller printed plain weave cotton with stripes: white ground with blue meander and light brown flowers alternating with a blue stripe with white and brown flowers and a red stripe with white and blue flowers.",
