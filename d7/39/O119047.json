            "public_access_description": "William Morris designed a number of wallpapers all with repeating patterns based on natural forms. This wallpaper was printed for Morris's company by the London firm Jeffrey & Co., who specialised in high quality 'Art' wallpapers. It required thirty wood blocks to print the full repeat, and used fifteen subtly different colours (more than any previous design by Morris). 'Acanthus' was issued in two colour combinations - one in shades of green and the other in predominantly reddish-brown tones.\n\n 'Acanthus' is a large-scale repeat which would appear to be most appropriate for large rooms. However Morris believed that a large pattern actually worked well in a small room. He explained that if it was well designed, a large pattern was more restful to look at than a small one. By the 1880s Morris wallpapers had become fashionable. When the wealthy Mander family furnished their newly built house, Wightwick Manor near Wolverhampton, they used Morris wallpapers in 13 of the rooms. 'Acanthus' was hung in one of the bedrooms.",

Veining and the use of fifteen subtly different colours (more than in any previous design) emphasise the vigour of the acanthus scrolls. A very similar conjunction of tiny background motif and scrolling leaves also appear in Morris\u2019s calligraphic and illuminated manuscripts. \n\nThe design in largely worked in watercolour and the printer would have had to interpret this in distemper \u2013 hence the colour notes on the front \u2013 including \u2018get Mr. Morris to paint in front leaves.\u2019 Notes on the back include \u2018The property of Mr. Morris 15/12/74.\u2019 \nAnother version of the design is in Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery. \n\n<i>Acanthus</i> was the first of a group of large-scale, heavily patterned and deep coloured paper: the others were <i>Pimpernel</i> (1876), <i>Wreath</i> (1876), <i>Rose</i> (1877) and <i>Chrysanthemum</i> (1877). The large size of this design requires thirty blocks to complete the pattern, making it an expensive paper costing 16s. a roll.'",
