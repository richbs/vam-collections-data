Their maker, Michel-Victor Cruchet, was a celebrated carver, who supplied many pieces of furniture to the households of both King Louis-Philippe and Emperor Napoleon III. \n\nCarving was extremely fashionable throughout Europe from about 1840 to 1870. The curators of the newly formed South Kensington Museum, which later became the V&A, bought many pieces from the various international exhibitions of the period. Their declared intention was to show these as examples of excellent craftsmanship, with the aim of improving the skills of British woodcarvers. At the time, woodcarving was practised as a craft by both men and women, though most carvers in commercial workshops were men. This pilaster, shown on the left of the image, is carved with the date of the exhibition and the painted cartouche shows a figure of Minerva, goddess of the arts.",
