Coaches were always a highly important emblem of the wealth and power of monarchs and in this case George I took the opportunity to add a strong statement about his intentions as king.  He came to the throne in 1714, after the death of Queen Anne, and by 1718 had already had to face an uprising of the Jacobites, British supporters of the Stuart dynasty.\n\nThe panel shows Brittania (the figure who represents Britain) enthroned in the centre, with a lion at her feet. On the left are figures of Concord (standing) and Learning (seated).  On the right stands a male figure representing Religion overcoming Vice. The nine female figures in the background may be the Muses, the goddesses of creative inspiration in the arts.\n\nThornhill was appointed History Painter to George I in 1718 and Sergeant Painter (a more lucrative post) in 1720.  He turned his decorative talents to ceilings, walls and theatrical scenery, as well as to coach panels.",
