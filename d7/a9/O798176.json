It shows an outline plan of the ceiling, not in Pugin's hand, and sketch designs added in pencil by Pugin showing shields in shaped quatrefoils and the frieze. The ceiling of the Prince's Chamber, formerly called Victoria Hall, was painted by the time the House of Lords was opened. It has been redecorated but the design remains unaltered with arms of England, Scotland and Ireland given on shields within shaped quatrefoils. \n\nAugustus Welby Northmore Pugin (1812-52) is widely considered as one of the most significant and influential architects, designers and theorists of the 19th century. Following his conversion to Catholicism in 1835, he identified the Gothic style with Christian architecture and his work and writings inspired and framed the Gothic Revival. In 'Contrasts', published in 1836, he condemned classical forms and ardently praised 14th and 15th-century architecture. Pugin is best remembered for his work on the Palace of Westminster.",
