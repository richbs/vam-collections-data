His work usually displays one or more of several decorative features;  polished silver forms, peened textured surfaces (called Bennellation!), and enamelled areas.  This server illustrates the first and last of these.  The style follows early eighteenth century tradition.  It is a highly functional implement of classic beauty, line and style, whose clean look harmonizes both function and decoration.  It is timeless in its crisp simplicity and elegance of proportion.  The woven effect on the handle, created by engraving and then floating enamel over the surface, is remiscent of eighteenth century wares whose handles were wickered to prevent the transmission of heat.  The rich decoration of the handle is set off by the cool, polished geometry of the handle.  The server stands firmly on the table, its handle raised to invite its grasp.",
