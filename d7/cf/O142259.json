After winning the Rome prize in 1895 and joining Wagner's office, he established his own office in 1898 and taught at the Vienna Kunstgewerbeschule from 1899 to 1936.  He was a founding member of the Vienna Secession, an avant-garde group of artists and architects.  In 1903 he founded the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte with Koloman Moser.  Hoffman's earliest works reflect the Vienna Secession's variant of Art Nouveau and his later work shows a pioneering use of geometric and abstract design.  His most famous building, the Palais Stoclet in Brussels, built 1905-1911, exemplifies the ideal of the 'Gesamtkunstwerk' or 'total work of art'.",
