The mount is signed by the artist who painted the image, James Pryde (1869-1941).\n\nPainted in a very restriced pallete of greys, whites and blacks it shows Henry Irving in the role of Dubosc in The Lyons Mail a play in which the plot centres upon a resemblance between the two characters Dubosc (a criminal who heads a gang of thieves) and Lesurques (a French Gentleman) who is accused of Dubosc's crimes. Irving played both parts in his production of the play which was written by Charles Reade and performed in circa 1883.  \n\nAs Ellen Terry records in her autobiography The Story of My Life Irving did not rely on make up to distinguish between the two roles but instead used body language and facial expression.",
