            "physical_description": "An octagonal, vertical sided box with flat top on a high foot, decorated in gold on black lacquer. \nFORM: The box consists of a base on a raised foot, a baseless central tier with removable tray and a lid. The raised foot, 2.5 cms high * 0.4 cms thick, has a slightly out-curving profile. Each facet of the base above this has an S-curve profile joined with an external ridge to a vertical section, which has another ridge of equal size at its lip. An internal riser, 0.8 cms high * 0.4 cms thick, stands slightly proud of the base on the inside. \nThe baseless middle tier is vertaical, with strenghthening ridge at top and bottom, and an internal riser 0.8 cms high * 0.4 cms thick. The top repeats the profile of the bottom, with vertical section topped by S-curve section with a strengthening ridge between them. The flat octagonal top is raised. The removable tray, which is divided into five compartments by ridges, fits into either the base or the middle tier. There is a tight fit between the sections.\nCORE: The core of wood or bamboo covered with a layer of composition.\nSURFACE:The interior of the box and upper surface of the tray are lacquered red, the undersides of the base and of the tray being plain black. All external surfaces are of black lacquer with 'incised gold' ('qiangjin') decoration, the solid seeming areas of decoration being achieved by fine hatching.\nDECORATIVE MOTIFS: The three bands of facets on the base, one on the central section and two on the top share a common arrangement: each consists of eight rectangular panels of diaper, outlined with a thicker line, this diaper being broken by a round-lobed cartouche containing a figurative subject. The loosely- executed diaper is probably a variant of the 'cash' pattern, omitting curves as not suited to the technique. It appears as squares with filled diagonals. The alignment of this diaper is not regular, even between different sides of the same panel, but the small size of the constituent elements makes for a dense texture in which the poor workmanship is not immediately apparent.\nThe subjects of the bands of cartouches, counting upwards from the foot are as follows: 1) Rocks and foliage. 2) Large single blooms. 3), 4) & 5) pairs of bitds (possibly indicating nuptial/erotic association). 6) Single real and mythical animals. On the top an eight-pointed lobed cartouche is framed by the same diaper as appears on the sides. Within this is a woodblock-derived scene of three adult male horsemen in official dress approaching a building through a landscape of rocks and pines. No-one appears to receive them, they are accompanied by four boy servants, two carring 'qin', one carrying a fan, one carrying books(?). There is no indication of the time of day.\nPROVENANCE: Formerly in the collection of Sir John Figgess.\nBOX: Modern Japanese wood box, no inscription, various paper labels. Wadded cotton wrapper.\nCONSERVATION:8/1973 ''All loose lacquer fixed down with hot resin and wax, colour retouched as required ''.\nDISCUSSION:The arrangement of the tray, and the persistence in Japan of the term 'jikiro' to describe boxes of this form, would suggest that they were indeed use for serving food. This example belongs to a rare if well -defined group of such tiered boxes decorated in the 'qiangjin' technique on either  a red or a black groud. It shares with other published examples the eight-pointed cartouche enclosing a figure subject, the diaper, and the round-ended cartouches on the sides. Compare the box illustrated as no 10 in George Kuwayama, Far Eastern Lacquer Los Angeles County Museum of Art (Los Angeles 1982), there dated 'Yuan' but arguable a late 'Ming' piece. Compare also the tiered boxes illustrated as nos 22-25 in Hirokazu Arakawa, ''Ch'iang-Chin, Chinkin and Zonsei Lacquerwares'' , Tokyo National Museum (Tokyo, 1974), particularly no 22 which has lost the middle tier, or else never had one. Two more examples of the group, grossly misdated are nos 49 and 61 in Lee Yukuan, ''Oriental Lacquer Art'' (New York/Tokyo, 1970).(cc 7/2/1985)",
