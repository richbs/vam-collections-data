            "public_access_description": "This plate is one of 72 that were comissioned with views of Egypt as part of the S\u00e8vres Egyptian Service 1810-12, one of the greatest examples of French porcelain to survive from the Empire period. Comprising of elaborate dinnerwares and architectural centrepieces, the service was commissioned by the Empress Josephine, partly as a divorce present from  Napoleon, but rejected as too severe. The service, then valued at 36,300  francs, remained at the factory until 1818 when it was given by Louis XVIII to Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington (1769-1852) for his assistance in helping to restore the Bourbon monarchy. The remaining service today is displayed at Apsley House, London.\n\nThe plates' views are from illustrations by Vivant Denon (1747-1825) for the published description of his journey to Egypt during Bonaparte's 1798 campaign,  Voyage dans la Basse et la Haute Egypte (1802). Denon was an artist, curator and author who worked in Italy and France and was Napoleon's Minister of Arts and first director of the Mus\u00e9e Napol\u00e9on (Louvre) (1802-15).  In 1786 Denon had sold a number of classical and Etruscan vases from his private collection to Louis XVI which were added to the S\u00e8vres factory reference collection. These vases and Denon's publication provided the inspiration for two editions of this S\u00e8vres service. The first Egyptian service was given by Napoleon to Alexander I of  Russia in 1808 (today housed in the The State Museum of Ceramics, Kuscovo, Russia).\n\nThis plate entitled \"Statues dites de Memnon\" has a central scene of the statue  of Amenhotep III at Luxor, taken from Denon's published prints. The scene was painted by J.-F.-J. Swebach Desfontaines (1769-1823) at S\u00e8vres, his signature painted on the lower left of the image. The gilding was by Micaud fils and the borders designed by Alexandre-Th\u00e9odore Brongniart (1739-1813), architect and father of Alexandre Brongniart (1770-1847) Director of the S\u00e8vres factory when the service was produced.",

Josephine was involved with the commission but eventually lost patience with the time taken to produce the set and though delivered to Ch\u00e2teau Malmaison on 1 April 1812 the service was rejected as the design was considered too severe. On return to the S\u00e8vres factory the service included 72 plates with Egyptian scenes  but when the service was given by Louis XVIII to Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington  (1769-1852) in 1818 for his assistance in helping to restore the  Bourbon monarchy, only 66 of these plates were accounted for. Ten plates in total (including four extras) had therefore been dispersed or lost (Mus\u00e9e national d C\u00e9ramique, S\u00e8vres MNC.1800 and 21630 - one of the extra plates, MNC.26308 - one of the missing plates from the service, also BM M&amp;ME 1993,6-10,1 - possibly a trial plate). \nUntil 1979 the surviving service remained with the Dukes of Wellington when it was acquired by the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum. Today one plate C.124:34-1979 is displayed at the V&amp;A, the remaining service is on loan to English Heritage and displayed at Apsley House, London.",
