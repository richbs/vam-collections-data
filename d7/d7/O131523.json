Sparkling synthetic mesh dotted with pom-poms makes a drop-waisted sleeveless dress with flared miniskirt. In the 1960s, long-established couturiers struggled to attract younger clients who wanted outrageous clothes from Carnaby Street or Chelsea's King's Road boutiques. It was a losing battle, as trendy young people often declined to shop where their mothers did.\n\nJacques Heim launched his couture business in the 1920s. In the 1940s he was one of the first couturiers to sell ready-to-wear clothing in boutiques. In 1957, Heim struck a deal with the London manufacturer R.L.Salmon Ltd. They bought the exclusive rights to reproduce Jacques Heim's Paris collections for a British audience. Twice a year, the couture house sent them sketches and materials for Spring or Autumn collections. The final results were approved by Heim before the clothes were sold by high end London boutiques.",

Twice a year, the couture house sent them sketches and materials for Spring or Autumn collections. The final results were approved by Heim before the clothes went to high end London boutiques.",

The original design shows a V neck, pocket flaps and short sleeves, and trimming around the hem, none of which are present in the actual object. A higher neck has been sketched in on the sketch, and an annotation says \"No sleeves. pocket flaps\"\n\nThis dress is rather more like the preceding sketch, \"Izmir\", which is virtually identical to the \"Malaga\" sketch, apart from the untrimmed hem, and is sketched as being made from an all-over dotted fabric, which suggests the net fabric with pom-poms used here. However, Izmir's swatch of fabric is a sorbet-pink linen with metallic threads.",
