Here he is disguised as a hunter to test the prowess of Arjuna.  A standing male figure holding in the right hand the hilt of a long dagger and in the left a bow.  He is bearded and dressed in a kind of leaf-skirt with sash, channavira-type harness, waistband and heavy type of sacred cord.   On his head he wears a kind of coronet apparently made of leaves and fronted with a broad fillet which extends to the shoulders on each side.  He stands on a double-lotus pedestal which is cast in one piece with a square base, the latter with uprights for the support of an arched-surround or torana, now missing.",

The style seems to have something in common with Vijayanagar murals at Lepakshi.   Nagaswamy mentions a \"similar representation found at the Padmanabhaswami temple at Trivandrum\".  A striking feature of the technique is the almost total absence of chiselling.",
