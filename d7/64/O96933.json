It is also intended as a kind of object of desire, covetable and collectible.  It is the ideal kind of object for a Kunstkammer in that it is small and light enough to be held in the hand and passed from person to person, and that it is attractive to the eye.  A famous sitter would also increase its attractiveness.\nWax is used as a sculpting material for preliminary models and for works in their own right. It is quick and easy to shape, yet also cheap. Once softened, it is modelled in a similar way to clay, with the composition built up gradually. To enhance the wax, pigment can be added before moulding and pearls or other jewels can be embedded in the surface afterwards. Wax was first used to make works of art, as opposed to models, in Italy around 1510. Later, Abondio became the first artist to make portrait medallions in wax.",
