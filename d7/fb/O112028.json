The tradition probably began in Turkey or Persia in 1100. By the 1600s France and the Netherlands in particular were known for producing high-quality marbled papers. \n\nThe main use for marbled papers has traditionally been as endpapers in books. The papers are produced by suspending colours on a liquid surface, manipulating them into patterns \u2013 either physically or with the help of chemicals \u2013 and then absorbing the pattern into paper. Historically, marbling was passed down from generation to generation, trade secrets kept within marbling families.",
