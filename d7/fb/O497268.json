            "physical_description": "Vase. This is a garlic-headed vessel, possibly dated to the 13th century A.D. (R.K.). The metal is pitted quite seriously, and the patina is damaged and worn, with greyish metal appearing in places. The vessel is damaged further, and there is a crude repair near the base. The abraded base plate looks yellowish, and seems to have been inset with solder. The base ring has some bare yellow metal exposed. General body patina colour is chocolate brown, and it seems to be paint or lacquer, which is very braded.\nMetal analyses were carried out, using non-intrusive EDXRF methods. The body, its repair, and the base plate were all investigated. Qualitative results for the repair showed that it was predominantly made with lead and tin, indicating that the material was a solder. The body metal was different from that of the base plate, although both alloys were mainly zinc and copper, which would account for the yellow  colour of the abraded metals. Each metal also contained small amounts of lead and tin. Neither of the alloys had zinc above 28%, so it could not be determined how the metal had been made. It would have been relatively easy to make them using the cementation process, but equally they could have been made by mixing the metallic elements.\nThe possible lacquer from the base plate was sampled on 18th November 1987. A small circle of silicon carbide paper was very gently rubbed against it , in order to remove a tiny amount for FTIR work. This was carried out by Gretchen Shearer. This sample was of the brown coating from the exterior, and it was possibly the same as that which coated the repair to the main body. The spectrum for this sample is reproduced in this report, but no certain identification could be made of the material in question.",
