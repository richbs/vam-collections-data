            "public_access_description": "In the medieval period, the bones and body parts of saints, as well as fragments of their possessions, were all known as relics. They were kept in a shrine, or in special containers called reliquaries. Both shrines and reliquaries were lavishly decorated with gold, silver, enamels and precious stones.\n\nThis is an exact copy of the medieval shrine in Zadar, Croatia, with scenes from the life of St Simeon. The original shrine was made to contain the mummified body of Simeon, who first recognised and blessed the newborn Jesus in the Temple at Jerusalem. This episode, described in the Gospel of St Luke, is shown on the front, in the centre. On the lid there is a full-size image of the saint\u2019s body.\n\nThe shrine was commissioned by Elizabeth, wife of Louis of Anjou, King of Hungary and Croatia.  The royal arms of Anjou appear at one end and another scene on the front shows Louis\u2019s visit to Zadar in 1358. Further scenes show the shrine itself being made, a process that took three years, and a goldsmith finishing off a column.\n\nAn inscription at the back states that the original shrine was made in 1380 by Francesco di Antonio, of Sesto near Milan. In 1497 Toma Martinov of Zadar did additional work to the interior. The V&A version shown here is an electrotype copy made by Royal Hungarian Museum of Industrial Art, Budapest in 1893.",
