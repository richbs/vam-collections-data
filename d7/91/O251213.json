            "public_access_description": "The relationship between artists and fashion designers is often very close. In the late 1960s and early 1970s the Scottish-Italian artist Eduardo Paolozzi created a series of prints called 'Moonstrips Empire News'. These captured the attention of  Jules-Fran\u00e7ois Crahay, head designer for Lanvin from 1964 to 1984. He commissioned special fabrics based on Paolozzi's designs which were exclusive only to Lanvin's Spring-Summer collection of 1971. This two-piece dress, called 'Djerba', was presented as an informal evening dress to wear in the countryside. This was typical of high end design, where outfits were presented for wearing in very specific circumstances. However, the wearer had the option of wearing the blouse and skirt separately.\n\nPaolozzi requested that Lanvin donate an example of this ensemble to the V&A in lieu of his royalties. Another Lanvin/Paolozzi ensemble, 'Malaga', was also donated (see T.303, A to D-1971). The 'Moonstrips Empire News' prints also inspired a series of Wedgwood ceramics, samples of which are held by the Ceramics Collection, (see CIRC.512-1972)",

It was exclusive to Lanvin, and was printed and made by the Italian company Bombyx and the French company Ducharne. Rather than accept royalties from the sales, Paolozzi requested that Lanvin donate the ensemble to the V&A in lieu of his royalties. Another Lanvin/Paolozzi ensemble was also donated (see T.303, A to D-1971)\n\nSome Wedgwood ceramics were also produced bearing a design inspired by the same print series.
