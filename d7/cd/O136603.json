            "public_access_description": "Spirit of the Carnival offers a political commentary on the ever-increasing police presence at London\u2019s annual Notting Hill Carnival. A solo masquerader in masked raffia costume performs at the centre of the scene. On every side he is penned in by an advancing line of police officers in identikit uniform. A wall of riot shields forms a circle around him, through which a snarling dog has broken through. However, rather than being intimidated, the masquerader continues his energetic dance. The dazzling colours of his costume and his outstretched hands seem to suggest a form of resistance. Some writers have read Joseph\u2019s image as a celebration of Black cultural and political resistance and resilience. It may also serve as a commentary on the way in which Carnival \u2013 and by extension the Black community \u2013 have become associated with criminality by the mainstream media.\n\nTam Joseph was born in Dominica in the Caribbean. He moved to London when a child and later studied at the Central School of Art and Slade School of Art. Joseph works as a painter, sculptor and graphic designer. This print reproduces an acrylic on canvas painting made by Joseph in 1984. The print was commissioned by the Paddington Print Shop for a portfolio of prints entitled 'Jouvert' by a variety of artists to celebrate the spirit of Carnival.",
