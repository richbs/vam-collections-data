His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean. \n\nThe rise of new forms of drama from the mid 1950s onward lessened demand for Messel\u2019s extravagant and traditional style of theatre design.  Chronic arthritis also contributed to his decision to move permanently to Barbados in 1966.  He carved out a new career as an architect, designing villas for private clients and some public buildings in the West Indies, including the Islands of Barbados, Dominica and Mustique.  \n\nHe defined a style of architecture and design on the hitherto undeveloped Island of Mustique, which he described as \u2018French Provincial\u2019.  The homes acknowledge characteristics of traditional French seventeenth century plantation houses on the island, such as stairs built on the outside of homes.  He disliked using rulers and set squares, so the elevations and plans are drawn free hand on squared tracing paper.",

Oliver Messel\u2019s production was first performed by the Glyndebourne Festival Society at Glyndebourne on 18 June 1952; directed by Carl Ebert and featuring  Juan Oncina as Don Ramiro and Sesto Bruscantini as Dandini.   It was revived in 1953 (Edinburgh Festival), 1954 (Berlin), 1956 (Liverpool), 1959 and 1960 (Glyndebourne).\nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's theatre designs and other designs and artefacts.  The designs were briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being housed at the V&A from 1981 on indefinite loan.  The V&A Theatre Museum purchased the Oliver Messel collection from Lord Snowdon in 2005.\n\nHistorical significance: Messel worked for Glyndebourne from 1951 to 1959, when he was at the height of his popularity as a designer for the stage.  His work for Glyndebourne in this period is regarded as some of his best designs.",
