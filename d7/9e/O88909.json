He was a Knight of the Order of the Elephant and wears the Order round his neck in this portrait. The artist, Jean Cavalier, was itinerant and specialised in ivory. He worked in Denmark, Bavaria, Brunswick, Stockholm and London; he probably died in Persia (Iran). This medallion is signed IC and dated 1693, and was almost certainly executed when Cavalier was in Copenhagen. Jean Cavalier (1650/60-1698/9), a Hugenot, was a native of France, and perhaps a Protestant. He travelled extensively, working as a wax modeller and ivory sculptor, and specialising in portrait medallions. Cavalier was the most accomplished ivory-carver working in late Stuart England until the arrival of David Le Marchand around 1700.",
