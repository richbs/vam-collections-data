Here, the heaviness\nof the ceramic donkey-head contrasts with the\napparent softness of the body, appearing to weigh\nit down. The sleeping donkey-child appears as\nsomething encountered in a dream, yet also\nsuggests the burden of expectation placed\nupon children.\n\nMade in London\nGlazed stoneware, steel, plaster and clothing\nMuseum no. C.22:1 to 3-2008\nAcquired through the generosity of Gerard and Sarah Griffin",
