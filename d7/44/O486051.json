In the lower right hand corner of the hanging is an old bearded man holding a crutch and possibly a flask. He is seated on a rock in a mountainous wooded landscape. He is looking toward a horned dragon which is hovering against the sun. The ground is a faded blue tabby silk ground, with pattern in pale blue silk and silver thread bound in tabby by a creamy white silk wrap. The ground is embroidered in a variety of materials and textures. Mainly embroidered in long and short and satin stitches (partly raised) with laid and couched work, in silver-gilt thread and twisted cord. The hanging is edged with two borders. The tan outer border is a satin in tabby by a cream warp. the inner border is of silk and possibly wool tissue with a pattern in blue and brown wool, cream silk and silvered paper strip. The hanging is lined with dark green striped cotton. Along the upper edge three silk cord loops, presumably for hanging.",
