English ceramics factories often copied sauce boats from examples made in silver. Early sauce boats were open boat-shaped vessels with one or two pouring lips, but late-18th-century ones were often tureen-shaped with a central foot. Both types could require an underdish to prevent spillage.\n\nUse\nThe five main sauces introduced by the French were b\u00e9chamel, brune/espagnol, tomate, mayonnaise, and velout\u201a. Gravies made from roasted meat flavoured with wine, citrus juice, capers, herbs and spices were also popular in 18th-century Britain. Other sauces had a 'roux' base, made by combining butter or lard with flour and broth or milk, and flavoured with parsley, onions, celery, anchovies, oysters, cockles or eggs. Butter sauces, served in smaller sauce boats or butter boats, frequently accompanied vegetables. A hot sauce of wine, butter and sugar was the most common one for puddings.\n\nPeople\nThe Derby factory appears to have been founded by Andrew Planch\u201a (died 1805), a second-generation Huguenot who had been apprenticed to a London jeweller. Planch\u201a may have employed London sculptors to supply models to be put into production at Derby.",
