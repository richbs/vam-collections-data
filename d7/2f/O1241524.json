            "public_access_description": "Paul Scott is a pivotal figure in the emergence of print-decorated ceramics as a major force within contemporary studio pottery. His own work, which often has political or social charge, draws upon the visual language of 19th century blue and white transfer-printed wares. This casserole is part of a series in which Scott has offered a commentary on the closure of the Spode factory in Stoke-on-Trent, utilising discarded wares found during a visit to the decommissioned works. This casserole is a kiln waster, damaged during the final firing of its manufacture.  Scott has emphasised this damage by gilding, added a new logo to the printed decoration bearing the words \"Spode Closed\", and preserved a layer of dust that had accumulated on the object by firing it into its glazed surface. In doing so, Scott has created a poetically charged and elegiac object that memorialises the once-great manufactory.",
