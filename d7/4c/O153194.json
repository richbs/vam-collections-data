Four pairs of feathery leaves come from the cardinal points on the penultimate ring of white points with a single curving green frond emerging from the alternate points. This central arrangement is surrounded by delicate tracery forming 8 points, each ending with either a small white  rosette or a larger iris like flower.  Three of the four irises have noticeable quantities of white silk; one doesn't.  Beyond this the tracery divides and curls back to form sprays of blue or blue and white flower heads.  Again, there is an absence of white in one section.  there is a narrow border formed  by an undulating line with trefoils.\nEmbroidery thread: dark green, red, blue, light brown, brown, white and light green.\nMetal thread: silver strip close S-wound on white silk; silver-gilt strip close S-wound on white silk.\nFacing: bias cut blue silk satin.\nBacking: pieced; dark blue plain weave cotton ground roller printed with densely packed lines of a small floral motif in yellow, green, light blue and red.",
