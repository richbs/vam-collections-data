It is possible that the chimney-piece was commissioned to commemorate the deaths of Giovanni Boni (1427-66) and his wife, Camilla Marsuppini, whose portraits, surrounded by winged shells, are included on the frieze. The use of the shell motif to represent salvation appears to derive from Roman funerary monuments where it signified the shell in which the soul was carried to the other world. \nThe chimney-piece is closely related in style to the work of Desiderio da Settignano and was previously associated with the marriage of Giovanni Boni and Camilla Marsuppini in 1463.

It is possible that the chimney-piece was commissioned to commemorate the deaths of Giovanni Boni (1427-66) and his wife, Camilla Marsuppini, whose portraits, surrounded by winged shells, are included on the frieze.\nBrought from a villa at San Miniato, near Florence.\n\nThe use of the shell motif to represent salvation appears to derive from Roman funerary monuments where it signified the shell in which the soul was carried to the other world.",
