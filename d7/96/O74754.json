Dior offered the glamour and romance of full skirts and nipped-in waists to women who were tired of utilitarian clothes with boxy silhouettes, mannish square shoulders and practical short skirts. This intricately cut afternoon dress of black wool, named 'Maxim's',  was worn with a black tulle cartwheel hat, long black gloves and simple black court shoes. To emphasise the bust, a large silk velvet bow was set into the low, square neckline and the waist was compressed by a cummerbund-style lower bodice. A heavy ribbed silk petticoat supports and defines the skirt. The dress fastens with a zip down the back .",

His voluptuous collection was the antithesis of lean, boxy wartime fashions. Instead, feminine designs featured rounded shoulders, a womanly bust and a hand-span waist above enormous skirts. It was christened on the spot by Carmel Snow, editor of American Harper\u2019s Bazaar, as the \u2018New Look\u2019. \n\nThe amount of fabric required to create a New Look garment \u2013 typically 15 metres in a woollen day dress, 25 metres in a short taffeta evening gown \u2013 caused outrage, for rationing was still in place. The collection was shown in secret to Princess Margaret at the French Embassy in London. But despite attempts by the Board of Trade to suppress it, the New Look was unstoppable.\" \n\n\u201cEvangeline (Bruce) performed her job with such panache and aplomb that she became the country\u2019s standard bearer as far as diplomacy went. \u2026 She had become the State Department\u2019s last word on good taste\u201d  writes C.
