An enthusiastic and skilled amateur, he   was elected to the Photographic Society of  London in 1869 and later contributed to  photographic exhibitions.   Rupert assisted the  artist Sir John Everett Millais (1829- 1896), a  close friend, by photographing backgrounds for  paintings and sitters for portraits. His favourite  subject, however, was Beatrix herself and his  prolific legacy of several hundred photographs  forms a broad pictorial account of her life from  infancy to marriage.\n\n\tBoth Rupert and Helen Potter were from  wealthy north-west England Unitarian families  who made their money in cotton manufacturing.  Beatrix's maternal grandparents, Jane and John  Leech, built their mansion, Gorse Hall, in  Stalybridge and were the principal benefactors  of Stalybridge Unitarian Church which opened in  1870. The first minister of the church was the  Reverend William Gaskell (1805-1884), husband  of the novelist and biographer Elizabeth Gaskell.  Gaskell became a close family friend of Rupert  Potter who shared not only his Unitarian faith  but also his Liberal politics.  In the 1870s the  Potter family rented Dalguise House near  Dunkeld in Perthshire for the summer months  and enjoyed frequent visits from Gaskell.   Beatrix Potter was particularly fond of him; she  recorded his death in her journal, 'Dear old man,  he has had a very peaceful end. If ever any one  led a blameless peaceful life, it was he. Another  old friend gone to rest. How few are left.'  At the  age of eight Beatrix knitted Gaskell a comforter  for a Christmas present; Gaskell replied with an  affectionate letter of thanks, 'Big as I am I know  I could not have done it one-tenth as well.  Every time I put it round my neck - which during  this weather will be every day - I shall be sure  to think of you.'",
