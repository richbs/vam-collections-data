Considering only the dated oil sketches in the Museum, the style of this is closest to that of No.100 [326-1888] of 1811.  While the sketch may well have been painted around that year, it may be dated less rigidly <i>c.</i>1810-15.\n\nNote on Nos. 109-113 [134-1888, 166-1888, 161-1888, 130-1888, 145-1888]\n\nNos. 109-113 form a miscellaneous and somewhat unhomogeneous group.  Most of them have either been assigned to a date near 1811 or may be compared with another oil sketch assigned to that date.  Accordingly, though their general character hardly warrants a dating more exact than <i>c.</i>1810-15 or within even wider limits, they are grouped together here.  Their relationship to Nos. 100 [326-1888] and 101 [128-1888], the earliest oil sketches in the Museum to show the full effect of the revolution in Constable's style, helps to justify this grouping.\"",
