Soundboard spruce, sides pine, naturals stained hardwood and sharps stained pearwood topped with ivory plaques. The inside of the lid is decorated with a hunting scene. The instrument's range is sixty-five notes, FF -a3. \n \nMuseum No.: 339-1882 \nKeyboard Catalogue No.: 26 \n \nThe clavichord was particularly popular in Germany and Sweden, where large-scale instruments continued to be made well into the 1840s. Barthold Fritz (1697 - 1766) is said to have produced \"more than 500\" clavichords that were exported as far afield as Archangel, Russia. He was a highly versatile mechanic, constructing devices that ranged from musical clocks to mechanical looms. In 1755 he published a treatise on mechanically harmonizing keyboard instruments, which he dedicated to C.P.E.Bach."

Barthold Fritz of Brunswick (1697\u20131766) was a highly prolific and inventive builder, who is reputed to have produced over 500 clavichords in his lifetime, as well as constructing musical clocks and mechanical looms. Clavichords made in Germany after about 1740 tended to be larger and slightly louder than earlier versions.",
