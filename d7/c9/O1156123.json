His scarlet hose match the red sash or chain he wears around his neck. He also wearing a blue and gold sash around his waist, a red and gold cap trimmed with feathers and purple boots with metallic gold decoration at the top. he is standing in front of a white cityscape.\n\nThe fact that both Edmund Kean (1787-1833) and his son, Charles Kean (1811-1868) were on the stage during the 1830s makes it difficult to determine which 'Kean' is depicted in this print. The firm which printed this image, J.Webb, was active in the 1830s so it could be either father or son as both played Iago at various points in their careers. It seems slightly more probable that it is Charles rather than Edmund Kean, as Charles Kean is known to have played Iago, to his father's Othello in Edmund's last performance in 1833. \n\nTinsel prints were created from etched portraits of theatrical stars in popular roles they played on the London stage. They were hand-painted in watercolour and decorated with scraps of material and tinsel additions. They were popular during the first half of the 19th century and were considered an adult, rather than a child's hobby. By the 1830s it was possible to buy the tinsel, leather and feather ornaments to go with each image.",
