This pattern itself is a mixture of naturalistic vine leaves and grapes and rather stylised floral and leaf forms. Other motifs include acorn, berry and beehive forms. The large central motif, which only appears once in full on this piece, is an elongated, pineapple shaped form at the base of which is a star like motif from which springs a stem with a formally arranged pattern of flowers, berries and leaves.\n\nDown the edge of the piece runs a continuous row of roundels containing leaf and flower forms. Every alternate compartment has within it a small, feathery pattern. The brocading is used for a background effect, whole motifs or part motifs. Despite the presence of individual motifs and long, curling stems running through the pattern, the whole pattern appears static and formal. This is accentuated by the stripe effect indicated by the series of roundels at the sides.",
