At the same time, the donor gave a version of the woman's outfit to the Textiles and Fashion collection (T.22-24-2012) which includes a skirt and blouse identical to those on the poster. This extremely rare poster was intended to be used on the London Underground to promote the new designer market-cum-collective Hyper Hyper which opened on Kensington High Street. Sarah Whitworth's boutique New Masters (renamed \"Deadlier than the Male\" in 1984) was one of the founder-members of the collective, specialising in seductive corset-based designs with a strong Gothic influence.\n- Daniel Milford-Cottam (May 2013)",
