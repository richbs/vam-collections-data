Inspired by and comparable to Alvar Aalto's bent plywood chairs from the same decade, Summers' chair achieved an integration of design and manufacture similar to Aalto's designs. The production process required no heat or steam, but relied on the veneers being glued together and held in place in a mould for eight hours.\n\nThe SF/SC dining chair was designed and manufactured in 1938 and proved to be one of Summer's last designs to go into production. The outbreak of war in 1939 meant that supplies of plywood became scarce, and in July 1940 Makers of Simple Furniture went bankrupt. Summers went onto establish Gerald Summers Ltd, a distributor of ball-and roller-bearings and the business continues to this day. Summers' wife later poignantly recalled that 'we had a family by this time and it was neccessary to make a start in something we felt was useful to the war effort. He [Gerald] had regrets about this change - his great love was designing furniture that was simple and functional'.",
