            "public_access_description": "This plaque is moulded with decoration showing a French Polichinelle or Punch show taking place in a booth or castelet, similar to booths used for British Punch and Judy shows since the early 19th century. Glove puppets, or marionnettes \u00e0 gainesare used in booths like this, the puppeteer being colcealed below the opening. Polichinelle is seen in the proscenium opening hitting his adversary with the type of stick that is also associated with Mr. Punch. Polichinelle is also seen as a rod puppet however, hanging in front of the booth suspended by a rod from his head. His hump is hollowed out, possibly as a receptacle for wax tapers or spills.\n\n\nThe French Polichinelle developed from the Italian character Pulcinella in the knockabout Italian comedy known as 'commedia dell'arte' after troupes of Italian commedia performers travelled to France in the early 17th century. The tradition of marionette shows featuring the character Polichinelle was established in Paris at the great fairs of Saint-Laurent and Saint-Germain by about 1650, by the puppet showman Pierre Datelin, known as Jean Brioch\u00e9. The diarists Samuel Pepys and John Evelyn who noted seeing this type of performance in London in the 1660s and 1670s may well have been seeing Italian performers who had come to London via France, and we know that Signor Bologna, the performer whom Pepys saw London, was in Paris with his marionettes in 1678 at the Saint-Laurent Fair.",
