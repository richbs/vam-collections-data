Traditionally, they would have turned to base metals, such as bronze, iron and steel. Now, with the continuous search for the \u2018new\u2019, they sought out a wider repertoire of metals and also innovative techniques to create colour through patina. Silver was oxidised, aluminium anodised and painted. The vivid shimmering colours of titanium jewellery are achieved by submerging the metal in an anodic bath and passing an electric current through it. It is an effect that was particularly popular during the 1980s, but was a relatively new technique when Reema Pachachi was experimenting with it while a student at the Royal College of Art in the late 1970s. \n\nReema Pachachi works today as a designer-jeweller, mainly in precious metals. When she made these earrings - she used non-precious metals and PVC for her work. The design was more important than the value of the materials applied. This pair of earrings was made just after she graduated in 1979 and mark the start of her successful career both as a jeweller and as a teacher.\n\nIn 1998 she stated: \u201cAlthough I now make precious jewellery, I\u2019m still aware of the fashion system and that helps to keep my work fresh.\u201d",
