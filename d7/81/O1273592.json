The body of the cup is divided horizontally in three sections, the upper section is decorated with an applied foliate Vitruvian scroll frieze; the central section has a pendant medallion on each side with a tied ribbon bow above adorned with foliate swags. The handles are modelled in wax over a wire armature as twinned twisted serpents, their heads aligned on either side of the handle with the rim of the cup. The spreading fluted cover has a foliate and beaded rim and collar and rises to a bell-shaped support to the pine-cone finial. The outer plaster surface of the vase and cover are coated in clay-coloured paint. The wax is tinted a dark reddish brown.",

            "public_access_description": "A silversmith's model in plaster and wax of a two-handled cup and cover, with serpent handles, pendant miniatures and pine-cone finial. Such silver two handled cups were made from 1760-1800 as trophies for horse-racing. particularly associated with the  race meetings in Doncaster and Richmond, both in the county of Yorkshire, in the north of England.  The decoration on this model may have been intended to celebrate a marriage as tied ribbon-bows and the twin medallion frames (although empty) are linked by foliate festoons symbolic of such life-events. The pine-cone is a symbol of fertility and associated with Bacchus, Classical god of wine. The elegant proportions indicate that the model was probably based on an architect's designs. The Scottish architect Robert Adam's designs for the gold Richmond Race Cup, 1759-60, and his brother James Adam's, 1764 design for a vase for Lieutenant General Lascelles, demonstrate that such celebratory vessels were often specially made to commission. This is a rare survival illustrating the process of modelling a vessel from a two-dimensionsal source, a print or drawing, and demonstrates and important stage in the design and production of a silver vase and cover.",
