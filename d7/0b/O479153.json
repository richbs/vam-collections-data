He is flanked by two smaller attendant figures standing on small plinths. The figures are set in relief against a  back slab with a simple decorated beaded surround.  The deity has a halo outlined in relief with a double row of beading which delineates the rounded top of the sculpture, although now most of the right hand part has been lost. The halo is further embellished with incised lines of radiating petals or rays.",
