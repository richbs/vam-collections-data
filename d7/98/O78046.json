Roller printing on textiles was introduced in the late 18th century and at first used mainly for small-patterned dress fabrics. By the 1830s it had become a highly mechanised process, and had largely replaced block printing in the production of fashionable furnishings.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe development of roller printing coincided with a radical transformation in the dyestuffs available for printing on cotton. Until the beginning of the 19th century printing had been based on the use of vegetable dyes. In Britain, France and Germany new chemical processes were developed and mineral colours produced that transformed the palette of colours available to the printer and made combinations such as the shades of pink and orange seen here possible.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe false trails of lace and bouquets of flowers in this design are inspired fairly closely by the patterns of woven silks from nearly a century earlier. Changing taste made such a design, printed on to cotton, suitable for furnishing a room in the 1830s, while the 18th-century silk that was its inspiration would have been intended for a woman's gown.",
