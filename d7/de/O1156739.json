Harry Beard Collection.\nThe words refer to Fleet Prison ca. 1740. \n\nFleet Prison was situated off Faringdon Road and is now occupied by Caronne House. The prison was named after a river that flowed outside the prison walls. Originally built in 1197 the prison was destroyed three times: Peasants' Revolt (1381), the Great Fire (1666) and the Gordon Riots (1780). In the 1750s Fleet Prison was mainly used for debtors and bankrupts. It usually contained some 300 prisoners and their families. Some inmates were forced to beg from their cells that overlooked the street, in order to pay for their keep. Fleet Prison is described by Charles Dickens in his novel The Pickwick Papers and was featured in The Rake's Progress by William Hogarth. Fleet Prison was demolished in 1846.",
