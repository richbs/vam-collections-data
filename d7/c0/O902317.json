The text is as follows: MANOCCHI, GIUSEPPE (c.1731-82) 1050 Drawing of a candelabrum in the antique Roman taste Inscribed in ink by C.H. Tatham \u2018Executed in marble standing 8 ft. 9 in. high. Perfect as represented. Price \u00a380. Rome Jan. 7. 1795\u2019 Black ink and dark brown wash 16 7/8 x 7 7/8 (428 x 199) D.1495-1898 PROVENANCE C.H. Tatham; Henry Holland; Sir J. Soane (included in an album containing letters and drawings sent by Tatham and others in Rome to Holland in London. Soane\u2019s book-plate is on the fly-leaf) The drawing is mentioned in a letter from Tatham to Holland, dated Rome 15 Febuary 1795, included in the same album. \u2018You will receive\u2019, writes Tatham, \u2018a sketch of a candelabra which the Proprietor calls antique, but I myself do not think so\u2026however, be it as it will, you will readily admire the grandeur and taste of the composition\u2026and is not over-rated at \u00a380\u2019. The proprietor was the sculptor Vincenzo Paccetti (c.1746-1820) who states in his diary on 10 Febuary 1795 that he has seen \u2018il Signor Tetam\u2019 and given him a drawing of his candelabrum to send to England, the price beign 400 scudi (the equivalent of \u00a380, according to a rate of exchange given by Tatham in a letter dated 10 July 1795 in the same album). This information was kindly given to us in a letter by mr Hugh Honour, who suggested that Paccetti was the author of the drawing. The handling, however, is exactly that of Manocchi, who might easily have been employed to make a drawing of the type in which he was a specialist.",
