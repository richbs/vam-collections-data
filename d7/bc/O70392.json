This paper is one of several block-printed sheets with pictorial patterns, which were made in the late 17th century and were designed to imitate tapestries or printed cloth wallhangings. Examples have been found in various locations, either as lining papers or, in one instance, as a wallpaper (in a first floor front room in a house in Epsom, Surrey). This paper was found on an early 17th-century box now in the Museum's collection.",
