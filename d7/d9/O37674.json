The garment is printed with a pirated design showing the character Bart Simpson, from the cartoon series 'The Simpsons'.  Bart is shown in purple T-shirt, with green shorts and shoes and a red mask, riding his skateboard with a speech \nbubble coming from his mouth containing the phrase \"I'M MR. BURT SON.  WHO THE HELL ARE YOU ?\" .  This should read \"I'M BART SIMPSON.  WHO THE HELL ARE YOU ?\" and in the UK  \"I'M BART SIMPSON.  WHO THE HECK ARE YOU ?\" - see B.167-1993.   The title  \"TEENAGE BOSS\" is printed above in white and red, and the phrase \"WATCH IT DADE\" (which should read \"WATCH IT, DUDE\") in purple and green.\n'The Simpsons' cartoon series, initially shown in the UK on cable television, is the creation of Matt Groening, and a wide variety of  Simpsons-related merchandise has been made for children.  Like the 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' and 'South Park', their appeal to children is supposed to lie in adult disapproval of them, and in the eccentric use of various words and phrases supposedly unintelligible to adults.",
