On this example the front has been enlivened with panels of stylised flower inlay, and applied mouldings in a style associated with Dutch furniture, thus creating a more imposing piece than a plain, panelled chest. It is built with a single large drawer below the main compartment, panelled to look like two smaller drawers, providing storage space for smaller objects that might otherwise be difficult to retrieve from the bottom of a chest. By the period when this chest was made, the form now known as a chest of drawers were becoming popular, but simple chests remained in wide use too. (The terms 'mule chest' and 'dower chest', sometimes used today for pieces of this hybrid form, were not used in the 17th century.)\n\nOn loan to the Elizabethan House, Plymouth.",
