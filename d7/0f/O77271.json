In this scene, the merchant Kitely, whose \u2018humour\u2019 is jealousy for his young and pretty wife, and his sister, suspects Wellbred, who lives with them, and other young men; he believes his wife has overheard him talking of these suspicions. \nThe Art Union critic commented: \nIt is a small picture, in which the presumed Kitely is seated looking downwards, and in the expression of his features doing full justice to his aching head. The figure is dressed in blue and is truly one of the most solid and substantial we have ever seen. On his right appears the dame addressing to him the above invitation; she is painted in reflected light, with features of much beauty. It is upon the whole a very remarkable picture, eminently distinguished by powerful and decided execution. \nThe Athenaeum simply thought it \u2018both in colour and effect, more complete\u2019 than another of Maclise's 1848 exhibits, \u2018Chivalry in the Time of Henry VIII\u2019. \nMaclise met Forster in 1830, and they became firm friends: for more details of Forster's life, see P35-1935 p184. Forster's participation in amateur theatricals with Dickens and Bulwer Lytron was well-known between 1845 and 1855. The first of these was 20 September 1845 at Miss Fanny Kelly's small theatre at 73 Dean Street, Soho; Dickens produced Every Man in His Humour, himself playing Captain Bobadil and Forster playing Kitely. Other parts were taken by the writer Douglas William Jerrold (Stephen) and the humorous artist John Leech (Matthew). Maclise himself was also invited to take part, but was too shy of performing in front of an audience. Forster scored a great success in his role; it has been suggested that the part of the obstinate Kitely admirably suited Forster's own personality. \nRichard Renton (John Forster and His Friendships 1912, p117) quotes a manuscript note, collected with the playbills for further performances on 15 and 17 May 1848 (Stratford Birthplace Library): \u2018The acting was generally good, C. Dickens and J. Forster in particular, but the costumes were awfully bad: Kitely and Cob were the only characters correctly dressed. Very poor audiences on both nights. Expenses heavy\u2019. Renton also quotes (pp134-5) two letters from Dickens to his friend Wilmott, who had been stage manager at Drury Lane and the Lyceum, one about the costumes on 7 August 1845: \u2018 ... I and some others want our dresses made at once, in order we may be easy in them, as well as in the words ... nobody can tell us so well as you where we can get them well, and not ruinously made\u2019. \nAs Ormond points out, the painting is similar in style and composition to Maclise's earlier cabinet pictures, such as \u2018Gil Blas Dressed as a Cavalier\u2019 (1839, NGI), and shows the influence of 17th-century Dutch art. This influence is evident particularly in the device of opening up views into other rooms; see Nicolaes Maes A Sleeping Maid and Her Servant (1655, NG) for example. \nOrmond also comments that: \n\nThe foreground figures are framed by the rectangular shapes of the doorways. The divergent diagonals of the two interior scenes are the one disturbing element in the design. Some measure of unity is restored by the consistently light tonality and the crisply defined quality of the paint surface. The picture as a whole, however, suffers from its genre derivation, and it is facile in comparison with the nearly contemporary \u2018Macready as Werner\u2019 [see F21 below]. Only when Maclise's imagination was challenged by a large theme could he produce a memorable image. \nA preliminary sketch for the painting is in the V&A collections. In the Forster collection in the V&A Library, there are two editions of the play containing production notes by Forster. A painting by C R Leslie of Dickens as Captain Bobadil in the same production was exhibited at the RA in 1846, and was recorded in a USA private collection in 1972. \nEXH: \tRA 1848 (111); Winter exhibition of old masters RA 1875 (255, as \u2018Kitely and Dame Kitely\u2019, and dated 1846, lent by Forster): Charles Dickens V&A 1970 (G15); Daniel Maclise Arts Council, National Portrait Gallery, 1972 (84) \nLIT: \tThe Times 2 May 1848, p6; Athenaeum 6 May 1848, p464; Art Union 1848, p167; O'Driscoll, p97; Ormond 1972, p76.\n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
