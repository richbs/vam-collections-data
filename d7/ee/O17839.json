Hilliard was attempting to challenge his former pupil and rival Isaac Oliver. Unfortunately, it reveals Hilliard's ignorance of Renaissance laws of perspective since the lines of the table and window go impossibly in opposite directions to and from the vanishing point.  Hilliard seems as uncomfortable with this format as Hatton does, the whole effect being unfortunately cramped and squat.  It was clearly an unsuccessful format and was quickly abandoned.\n\nPeople\nSir Christopher Hatton, Lord Chancellor, rose rapidly in the Queen's favour, having first been Captain of the Guard in 1572. In this miniature  he is shown wearing his robes of state and, as a Knight of the Order of the Garter, both its collar and on his left leg the garter itself.  His ceremonial mace and seal bag are on the table to his right.\n\nOwnership & Use\nThe dog at Hatton's feet was probably intended as a symbol of loyalty and it is possible that this miniature was intended for the Queen.  Hatton in his youth was famed for his good looks and was one of the Queen's favourites.  In old age she remained as devoted to her servant as he was to her.",

Full Citation:\n\n\u201cNICHOLAS HILLIARD\n\n<b>89 Sir Christopher Hatton</b>, 1588-91\n\n<i>Victoria & Albert Museum (p.138-1910)</i>\nVellum stuck to a playing card with four clubs showing at the reverse, oval, 56 x 43 mm, 2 3/16 x 1 11/16 in.\n\nSir Christopher Hatton (1540-91), Lord Chancellor, rose rapidly in the Queen\u2019s favour, became Captain of the Guard, 1572, vice-Chamberlain, 1578, High Steward of Cambridge University, 1588, and Lord Chancellor, 1587-91.\n\nHilliard\u2019s miniature of Hatton must have been painted between 1588, the year he was made K. G., the collar which he wears, and his death.  He wears the robes of Lord Chancellor which he became in 1587 and on the table to the left is the Chancellor\u2019s mace and seal bag.  Hatton was famed for his good looks and Naunton refers to him as being \u201ctall and proportionable\u201d (<i>Fragmenta Regalia</i>, 1808 ed., p. 248).  There is an important reference to Hatton in Hilliard\u2019s <i>Treatise</i> which should relate to this sitting.  It occurs in his discussion of \u00fcrer\u2019s theory of proportion in relation to the face:\n\n\u201cTherefore I will be bold to remember me of one, namely Sir Christopher Hatton, sometime Lord Chancellor of England, a man generally known and respected of all men amongst the best favours, and held to be one of the goodliest personages of England: yet had he a very low forehead, not answerable to that good proportion of a third part of his face\u2026\u201d\n\n(<i>A Treatise Concerning Arte of Limning</i>, ed. R. K. R. Thornton and T. G. S. Cain, Carcanet New Press, 1981, p. 81).\n\nThe dating of this experiment with a full-length miniature on a minute scale as after 1588 makes it follow in date Oliver\u2019s earliest experiment of this type of scale dated 1587 (no. 137).  As usual there it no grasp of the rules of scientific perspective, the lines of the table and window going impossibly in opposite directions to and from the vanishing point.  Hilliard abandoned this format almost immediately.\n\nThis version is the <i>ad vivum</i> while at Bevloir there is a replica (V&A, 1947 (51)).  In the latter the sun is shining through the window and there is a fireplace to the right.  The overall height of the figure in the Belvoir version is just under two inches.  In the case of the V&A\u2019s version, 2 3/16 inches, also the areas of green have flaked badly and been restored and the areas using lakes have faded.  Recently a head and shoulders version related to the same sitting has come to light (Private Collection).\n\nCOLLECTIONS: Either this or the version at Belvoir, Stowe sale March 15th 1849 (lot 87); J. L.
