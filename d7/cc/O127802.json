She went on to study tapestry at the Royal College of Art under the tutelege of the prestigious weaver Marta Rogoyska.  Collins' work shows a similar use of colour, shape and the same liveliness in its execution as her mentor.  Her imagery, however, is unique and 'Incantations' is a superb example of her eccentric colour schemes and inventive composition.  Collins uses traditional weaving techniques to create her tapestries, which in contrast are often rather innovative in their outcome.  She looks to nature as an unending source of inspiration for her work and her creative eye is stimulated both by the traditional English garden, inhabited with flora and fauna, but also by the night sky when it is 'populated with moonbeams, sand surf and shooting stars', as can be seen in Incantations.",
