            "public_access_description": "The Italian comic theatre, or Commedia dell'Arte, became all the rage in Europe in the 18th century thanks to the performances of Italian travelling troupes of actors. The cast of stock characters would have been familiar to everyone, the most notorious being the mischievous and outrageously hilarious servant Harlequin.  Columbine was the flirtatious lady's maid of Isabella, and was often paired with Harlequin, or portrayed playing the hurdy-gurdy or the mandolin.  However, when dancing as in this model, she was usually grouped with a different partner, Scaramouche, a Neapolitan valet.  Her mask symbolises the 'hide and seek' element of courtship and love as played out on the stage and indeed on occasion, in real life.\n\nColumbine is one of sixteen 'pantomime figures' modelled by the great modeller at the Nymphenburg factory, Franz Anton Bustelli.  The different models were mentioned on a factory document dated 1760, however their playful elegance and artistry have given them a lasting popularity.  They were still being produced in the 19th century and are being made again at the factory today.",
