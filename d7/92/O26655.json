Series III has 83 cards of ten monarchs from Charles II to Victoria. Each monarch card has an illustration of the king or queen, the name of the line, e.g. Tudor, a list of the title of other cards needed to make a set and the number of cards in that set.

This is similar to Counties of England which was also produced as a series of three.\n\nThe aim of the game is for the players to attempt to collect the additional cards that accompany the main picture card to create sets or tricks.  The player with the most tricks wins the game.  The main picture cards name important events and people associated with the lives of the monarchs, and these are listed individually on the additional cartds.  Some groups are larger than others, with the largest consisting of a total of 7 (Henry VIII for example)`",
