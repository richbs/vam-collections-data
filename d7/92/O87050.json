The flowers have five purple petals with yellow centres.  The modelling of the plant is achieved with loose hatchings and brush strokes in darker tones. The painting is framed with a simple inner border of pale yellow paper collaged in strips with black outlines.  It is mounted on a plain ivory-coloured page which has strips of greenish-grey paper and black outlines on the inner sides pasted along its edges.  The inner edge has a strip of woven textile applied to it acting as a gutter for the album binding.",

It contains 56 leaves on which are Mughal miniature paintings, drawing and flower studies on both sides. The binding is covered with an Indian brocade silk that may have been cut from lengths brought home by the 2nd Lord Clive, who served as Governor of Madras, 1799 to 1803.  The album was sold from Powis Castle at Sotheby's sale, 16 to 18 January 1956, lot 332A.",
