            "public_access_description": "The art of engraving gemstones can be traced back to ancient Greece in the 8th century BC and earlier.  Techniques passed down to the Egyptians and then to the Romans.  There were major revivals of interest in engraved gems in Europe during the Byantine era, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and again in the 18th and 19th centuries.  At each stage cameos and intaglios, these skillful carvings on a minute scale, were much prized and collected, sometimes as symbols of power mounted in jewelled settings, sometimes as small objects for private devotion or enjoyment.  This intaglio probably originally formed the flat face of an engraved gem in the form of a scarab beetle.  The scarab is an ancient symbol dating back to around 8,000 BC.   For the ancient Egyptians, the scarab beetle pushing the ball of dung containing its eggs was a metaphor for the daily passage of the sun across the sky, and thus for the concept of  rebirth. Carved scarabs exist from giants 15 metres long and 9 metres high, to tiny amulets used as charms or in burials, and seal stones or ornaments for personal use.  Materials used vary according to perceived properties of the stone, or intended use. The popularity of scarabs as charms and ornaments persisted, and they continued to be made, the skill passing from Egypt to Greece, and thence to Italy.  The style of the carving of this intaglio places it in Etruria (today Northern Italy) between 400 and 300 BC.  The subject is taken from Greek mythology.  Argos (or Argus) the ship-builder, stands next to his ship the Argo, which carried Jason and the Argonauts on their perilous voyage from Greece to capture the Golden Fleece.",
