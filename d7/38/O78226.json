Her youth and charm made her a monarch of unparalleled popularity. The formal state procession of the Coronation was therefore reintroduced, even at the extra cost of \u00a326,000, so that the maximum number of people could see her. 400,000 people were said to have slept on the streets of the processional route the night before the Coronation. On the day itself, Queen Victoria wrote 'many as there were the day I went to the City, it was nothing - nothing, to the multitudes, the millions, of my loyal subjects who were assembled in every spot to witness the Procession. Their good-humour and excessive loyalty was beyond everything and I really cannot say how proud I feel to be the Queen of such a Nation.'\n\nSubjects Depicted\nOn the outer cloth boards there is a gilt embossed image of 'The Queen's New Crown'. The young female monarch required a lighter crown than had been used by earlier monarchs. Its design, and incorporation of many of the most famous crown jewels, meant that it became the object of great public interest. This was further enhanced by its display in the shop window of the jewellers Rundell, Bridge & Rundell, in Ludgate Hill, London, where, free of charge, large crowds came to view it.",
