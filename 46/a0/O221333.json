Robbins, who was one of the exhibitors at Cybernetic Serendipity, a major exhibition held at London's Institute of Contemporary Arts in 1968. \n\nThe Cybernetic Serendipity exhibition catalogue contains a number of computer-generated designs by Robbins, plus an image of the painting by Steele. (p.80). In the accompanying text, Robbins explains how he created a computer program to generate images inspired by the work of artists such as Steele.\n\nThe reproductions were donated to the Museum by the Computer Arts Society, which organised a number of exhibitions in the late 1960s and early 1970s.",
