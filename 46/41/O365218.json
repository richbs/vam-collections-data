The panel is woven with a pink textured ground and has a design of lace meanders which are intertwined with furry meanders, simulating leopard skin in black and cream silk. There are two repeats in the width of the material. The panel once formed part of a dress which had been altered later. \n\nThe ground has an additional flushing warp, forming a ribbed effect. Each flushing warp floats over 11 threads and is bound by the next three. The pattern is entirely brocaded. The ground of the lace meander is brocaded with red silk and the flowers in white silk and white silk fris\u00e9. The furry meander is carried out in several shades of buff silk and black. The brocaded wefts on the furry meander only are bound in 3/1 twill. Selvage is 0.375 inch wide, 0.19 inch plain pink tabby and 0.19 inch composed of 8 yellow silk cordonnets.",
