Several different Toby jugs and figurines of Liston as Pry were produced, based on contemporary engravings, after Liston's huge success as the interfering busybody in John Poole's play which opened at London's Haymarket Theatre on 13 September 1825. The play was enormously popular throughout the 19th century; Paul Pry's catch-phrases 'I hope I don't intrude', 'Just dropped in' and 'It's nothing to me' were quoted everywhere, and the name Paul Pry became a well-known term for a busybody.\n\nListon achieved his greatest successes in farce, particularly as Paul Pry, but was also well known for several other roles depicted in drawings, painting, engravings and figurines. An expert dancer, Liston became the highest paid comedian on the stage, earning  between sixty and a hundred pounds a week at the Olympic Theatre, a huge salary for his day. He retired in 1837 after a career that spanned over thirty years.",
