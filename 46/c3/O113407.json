            "physical_description": "Notes from NT study day 2003, NH\nOak table with single drawer and carved decoration. Acquired as mid 17th century with a modern replacement stretcher.\n\nInteresting features to note:\n*The detachable top is quite usual for such  tables. This is formed by two planks butt-jointed and held at the ends with what is sometimes known as bread-board construction.\n*The squared and chamfered legs are much more 18th c than 17th c in style. *A massive dowel hole on the PL front leg suggests that it has been reused, (perhaps from a bed-stock), though a farmhouse table might well be made up using older timber. \n*The colour of legs and the carved aprons does not match. The carved apron appears on one side and below the drawer. That it appears on one side only is not unusual as customarily the long-side of the table might stand against a wall. But each apron has a long mortice hole incompatible with this table, also suggesting reuse of timber.\n*Drawer: Attention, boards are loose, handle with care!\n17c tables did not customarily have a drawer in this position. Drawer knob of fruitwood. Drawer of simple nailed construction. \n*Drawer supports of walnut (note worm damage) are unusual - are they self-consciously rustic, as if made in the later 19c as an exercise in traditional  country craft furniture?\n\nPTO\n The chisel-carved lunette motif on the apron remained in use long after the 17c and does not by itself indicate a 17c date. The shape of the legs and drawer however rule out this table as a 17c example. Rurally produced furniture often tended to be conservative in design and ornament. The interesting question here is whether the table is an 'honest' example of about 1800, or made later (1860-1940) to look deliberately old fashioned.",
