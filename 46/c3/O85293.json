            "public_access_description": "Although tobacco was introduced to Europe in the sixteenth century, the way in which it was used differed greatly from modern habits.  A fine tobacco powder known as snuff was inhaled from the back of the hand or the fingertips.  Dried tobacco leaves were generally sold in tightly bound bundles, and, although commercially produced snuff was available, many snuffers preferred to make their own. Snuff rasps like this one were developed to be conveniently carried in a pocket so that a portion of snuff could be prepared at any time by grinding a bundle of dried tobacco leaves on the metal grater or rasp.  Many snuff rasps incorporate a snuff-box to hold any excess produced, although this example does not.  \n\nSnuff-taking was an expensive habit and could only be afforded by the well-to-do, with the result that snuff-related objects, like rasps and boxes are often made from precious materials like ivory, and are beautifully decorated with carving or inlay.  This boxwood example from France was made some time between 1680 and 1720 and has lost its metal rasp.  The carving to the reverse includes a coat of arms, now defaced, supported by two lions rampant and surmounted by a ducal coronet.  The finial resembles a cockle shell from one side, but becomes a skull when the rasp is turned over.",
