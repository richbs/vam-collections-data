If so, it would probably have been used to serve up cakes or bread and butter, as can be seen in 18th-century paintings of tea parties. The gap between breakfast and dinner increased during the second half of the 18th century (dinner was pushed from early afternoon to around five o'clock), so a snack of bread and butter or cakes would have been a welcome addition to afternoon tea. The tea itself was usually prepared by the lady of the house.\n\nMaterials & Making\nAlthough the Bow factory concentrated on utilitarian pieces, it made comparatively few transfer-printed wares, possibly because the printed image all too easily sank into the soft-lead glaze. The printing here is unusually crisp. Sets of 'printed teas' are mentioned in a factory document of 1756.",
