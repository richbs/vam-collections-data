This view includes the village of Sungla. He wrote: 'The Buspa Valley is celebrated for its beauty and its shooting grounds; my interest lay only in the former, and the part about Sungla was certainly very fine. Groves of walnut trees clustered thick on each bank of the Buspa, which meandered peacefully through the valley: above these, far up the hillsides, flourished the pine and the sturdy deodar \u2013 the whole shut in by lofty mountains\u2026.
