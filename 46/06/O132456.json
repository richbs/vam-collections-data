            "public_access_description": "Oliver Messel (1904-1978) was Britain's leading theatre designer from the early 1930s to the mid 1950s, working in every aspect of entertainment - ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue - as well as in interior decoration and textile design.  He descended from a well-off banking family, and was very much a part of  high society, appearing regularly in the illustrated magazines at various events.  A popular part of society entertainment in the pre and even post-war years was the fancy dress and costume balls; Messel himself attended many, often making his own costumes, and would have carried out commissions, especially for accessories, for his friends or wealthy clients.  This headdress, which is too subtly made for theatre or film, which requires a bolder approach, is probably for a costume ball and may have been made for the famous society beauty, Lady Diana Duff-Cooper.  \n \nMessel's lavish, painterly and romantic designs informed by period styles, were perfectly in tune with his times and earned him an international reputation.  By 1960, however, Messel's style had become unfashionable, having no sympathy with the new 'kitchen sink' school of theatre.  He increasingly concentrated on non-theatrical painting and designing and eventually retired to the Caribbean, where he began a new career designing and building highly idiosyncratic luxury villas.",

Fancy dress balls were extremely popular in the mid-20th century; Messel himself attended many and would have carried out commissions, especially for accessories, as well.  The headdress is finely made, and is certainly too subtle for theatre or even film.   \nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's remaining designs and artefacts (many designs were sold or given away during the artist's lifetime).  The collection was briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being placed on indefinite loan to the V&A Theatre Museum from 1981.  The Oliver Messel Collection was purchased from Lord Snowdon in 2005 with the aid of the Heritage Lottery Fund, The Art Fund and the Friends of the V&A.",
