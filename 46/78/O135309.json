He is a printmaker of long standing, and his most recent work has focused on the integration of computer technology into fine art practice. His own work involves layering and integrating different techniques, using the computer to manipulate imagery, which is then printed using a mix of traditional and digital methods.\n\nThis print is one of four from the series 'Chairs', made in 1993, and comes from a larger group of prints by the artist in the V&A collection representing key phases in his exploration of fine art printmaking. The prints from the 'Chairs' suite are elegant and accomplished amalgamations of personal and domestic motifs relating to issues of identity, as indicated by the use of the fingerprint-like linear motifs which overlay or surround the central chair motif.",
