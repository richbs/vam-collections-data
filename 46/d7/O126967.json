This type of bag is known as a 'khalechi' and is made and used by the Banjara people of Central India. Originally transporters of goods for the Mughal armies, the Banjara have maintained an itinerant life-style, and are to be found in several parts of central and southern India. The Banjara women are easily identifiable by their flamboyant dress and heavy jewellery. Household items like this bag were embroidered by them in distinctively striking designs, often covering the whole surface of the piece with colourful, geometric designs. The stitches used are variations of western Florentine stitch, tent-stitch and satin-stitch, and the pieces are also often decorated with pompoms, cowrie-shells and mirrors.",
