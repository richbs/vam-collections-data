Mary Hurry used the signature of \"P Hurry\" and was known by her friends and associates as Polly Hurry or Mrs John Farmer. Her earliest years were spent at the family home \"South Lodge\" in Donnithorne Street, Kyneton. She attended Ruyton Girl's School, Kew. Her interest in art began at the Kyneton School of Mines, where she took lessons in drawing and wood-carving. Later she learnt water-colour painting from the Scottish born artist, John Mather (1848-1916). \n\tAfter a camping holiday where she met several artists, she then decided to take art seriously and started drawing from life, at the old Temple Court studios in Melbourne. Shortly after this period (c.1914) she was induced to interview Max Meldrum, and she looked back upon that meeting, as her first and most important lesson, and her real introduction to art. Max Meldrum started a painting class soon after and she was with Harry McClelland one of Max Meldrum's earliest pupils. This period was the start of the Meldrum School of Painting which attracted many pupils including her future husband, the noted artist John MacCormack Farmer.\n\tThey married on the 13th of August, 1921 and set off to China and Japan where they visited and painted many localities including the Great Wall of China and the Temples of Nikko in Japan. It is recognised that Polly Hurry and John Farmer were the first Australian born artists to paint in China. On her return to Australia the following year she moved to Olinda in the Dandenongs. Her home and studio called \"Miyako\" meaning grand view, was the venue for many artists' gatherings. \n\tIn late 1923 she set out, with her husband, for Europe arriving firstly at Paris, where she painted two copies after Velasquez at the Musee National du Louvre (February - May, 1924). From Paris she travelled south to the French Riviera painting the coastal city of Nice. Further time was spent in Holland and England where two portraits were exhibited at the Royal Society of Portrait Painters in London. \n\tReturning from Melbourne in 1926 she exhibited, jointly with John Farmer, fifty seven works mostly of scenes in England and France. At this time she was elected as a member of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors, exhibiting from 1927 onwards to 1962. \n\tA second trip was made to Europe in early 1932 working and exhibiting in London and Paris. John Farmer had established a studio and school in Mont Parnasse, Paris. It was in 1933 that Polly Hurry had several portraits hung in prominent positions in the French salons. In 1935 she returned to Australia. She had kept a studio in Melbourne at Number 9 Collins Street (Studio 2) where many of her artist friends gathered including J. Cumbrae Stewart, Norah Gurdon, Dora L. Wilson, Jessie Traill, Norah Wilkie and Margaret Pestell. Her nickname among this group of women artists was \"Hurrums\". This studio was used by her for painting many noted portrait commissions during the 1930s and 40s. Polly Hurry's studio was also made available once a week during the war years, for artists and students to work in to raise money by selling paintings and craft objects for the war effort. She was a leading member of the Women Artists' National Service Group which was formed in October 1939. \n\tPolly Hurry continued to work and exhibit with the Twenty Melbourne Painters Society and the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors until late in life. For health reasons she moved from Olinda to Frankston in 1954 and died there on the 5th of August, 1963.'\n<u>Twenty Melbourne Painters; Catalogue; 11th Annual Exhibition</u>, Athenaeum Hall, Melbourne, 24 September to 5 October 1929, 10am till 5pm (Phoenix Press, Melbourne, 1919), no. 76 (illustrated)\nThe artist annotated a copy of the 1929 exhibition catalogue as follows: 'Colour scheme: Pale primrose dress, black shawl with orange, blue, and green fringe - black screen with dull gold background, black hair gold shoes - My first full length large picture.'\n<u>Twenty-fifth annual exhibition of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters</u>, Athenaeum Gallery, Melbourne, Australia, 1932, cat.63.",
