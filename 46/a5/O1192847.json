In the 1960's they one of the largest toy manufacturers in the world, and owned many subsidiary companies, including Pedigree Dolls Limited, which was formed on the 1st January 1964. This catalogue is the first to be produced by the this company. Previously, the range had been produced by International Model Aircraft Limited, another Lines Bros. subsidiary (although in effect it was only the name of the company that changed, as the range was produced in the same factory as before). This 40-page catalogue contains photographs and descriptive text on the whole Pedigree range of dolls, soft toys and playthings for 1964. It was sent to toy retailers, rather than the general public, to advertise the range, which includes dolls, jointed teddy bears, washable soft toys, wheeled soft toys and chassis toys for children to ride on, pull-alongs, vinyl squeakers, bath toys and novelty toys.",
