After school in Yorkshire, worked in turn for a fishmonger, attorney, housepainter, and bookseller. Trained first as a miniature painter; acquaintance with John Bell (see FA253, p31) and his nephew Edward Bell led him to produce mezzotints; also made coloured copies from prints after George Morland and others. First oil painting was a portrait of his wife, which resulted in an introduction to Sir William Beechey RA. Exhibited 99 works at the RA between 1802 and 1845, nine at the BI 1815-42, and 15 at the SBA 1831-47. Almost all were portraits, and after 1816 many were of actors and theatrical scenes in the tradition of Zoffany and Samuel de Wilde. His studio in Gower Street became a rendezvous for the leading actors and actresses of the day. Elected ARA 1821; repeated failure to be elected RA resulted in his resignation 1836. Died Kensington, London, 10 May 1854.\n \nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1854, pp212-3 (obit by his pupil R W Buss) \n\n<b>La Palermitana</b> \nFA22 Neg 75948 \nCanvas, 76.2 x 62.2 cm (30 x 24\u00bd ins) \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nA woman from Palermo in local costume. Exhibited at the RA in 1834. A unique type of subject in the artist's \u0153uvre but the motif of a woman leaning from a window or balcony is traditional, particularly in Dutch 17th-century painting. There is no evidence that Clint travelled abroad. \n\nEXH: RA 1834 (231)\"",
