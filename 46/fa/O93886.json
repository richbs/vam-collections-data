It has a metal fitting for holding umbrellas or walking sticks at the side, a compartment for hymn-books at the back, and a hook on which to hang a kneeler. The solid seat is shaped for comfort in the manner of a Windsor chair. The stretchers joining the legs are given extra strength by diagonal members, running back from the high front rail, which allows space for the feet of the person kneeling in front. Church chairs were made purely as functional pieces, an alternative to fitted wooden pews. They needed to be cheap, simple and stong enough to withstand constant use. Most were based on country chair designs, with turned legs and solid or rush seats.",
