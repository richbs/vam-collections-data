The earliest datable Staffordshire figures appear to be those of Queen Victoria, who was crowned in 1837.  Images of royalty proved lucrative and during the 1840s Staffordshire pottery firms issued countless other royal figures. Although some appeared after Victoria's death in 1901, few were made after 1905.  During their heyday however they were produced in vast numbers, usually modelled after prints. As well as the royal family they represented a wide variety of subjects, including military heroes, political figures, actors and actresses and famous poets and playwrights.  This figurine of William Shakespeare (1564-161) is one of several versions of him produced by various Staffordshire firms. Moulded figurines like this were relatively cheap and extremely popular; the possession of a figurine of Shakespeare would have been considered a mark of taste in many a Victorian household.",
