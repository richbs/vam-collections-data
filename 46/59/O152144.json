Although his work later became figurative, in the 1970s he was working in a more abstract style, although still with reference to real objects. This print relates to three-dimensional pieces he was making  in the early 1970s where panels of wood, some with parts cut away, were stacked, twisted or overlaid. In some of these pieces Williams seems to be working with a cross-over from two to three dimensions, using the idea of a shadow as a solid part of the sculpture which at the same time remains flat. His screenprints at the time reflect this interest in spatial ambivalence.",
