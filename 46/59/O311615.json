The figure, like its pendant (Museum no.  A.17-1954) is fully carved at the back, the clothes being doubled up behind her. These pieces have been convincingly attributed to Johann Christoph Ludwig L\u00fccke. They relate most closely to his partly painted ivory figure of Prince Frederick of Denmark (1753-1805), who is shown as a baby in swaddling clothes, wearing the Order of the Elephant, and to an ivory swaddled baby mounted in ormolu formerly in a private English collection, and now lost, as well as to a Vienna porcelain box in the form of a swaddled baby.  \n\nThis ivory and its pendant have been seen as a playful doll-like parody of representations of the Laughing and Weeping Philosophers, Democritus and Heraclitus. L\u00fccke executed pairs of these in a different materials, including steatite. However this girl is not laughing, but pensive; even the fact that she is female seems to contradict the idea of a direct parallel with the ancient philosophers. Her finger at her mouth suggests she is requesting silence, and since she is paired with the yelling baby (probably a little boy), Museum no. A.17-1954, it seems likely that the meaning of this piece is a representation of restraint and temperance, as opposed to uncontrolled anger and frustration. It is notable that she lies unswaddled, whereas her partner is tightly bound to prevent him misbehaving.",

Said to have been formerly in the collection of Earl Fitzwilliam, presumably William Henry Lawrence Peter Wentworth-FitzWilliam, 8th Earl FitzWilliam (1910-1948) of Wentworth Woodhouse in Yorkshire.\nThese pieces have been convincingly attributed to Johann Christoph Ludwig L\u00fccke. They relate most closely to his partly painted ivory figure of Prince Frederick of Denmark (1753-1805), who is shown as a baby in swaddling clothes, wearing the Order of the Elephant (Hein 2000, cat. no. 58 on pp. 88-9), and to an ivory swaddled baby mounted in ormolu formerly in a private English collection, and now lost, as well as to a Vienna porcelain box in the form of a swaddled baby (Theuerkauff 1982, p. 23, figs. 7, 8 and 11).  A pair of comparable silhouetted ivory reliefs against a black background also showing a crying boy and a small girl is in the Gr\u00fcnes Gew\u00f6lbe in Dresden.",

            "historical_context_note": "This ivory and its pendant have been seen as a playful doll-like parody of representations of the Laughing and Weeping Philosophers, Democritus and Heraclitus. L\u00fccke executed pairs of these in a different materials, including steatite (see Trusted 2007, pp. 102-3, pl. 179; see also Theuerkauff 1982, figs. 22-5). However this girl is not laughing, but pensive, and even the fact that she is female seems to contradict a direct parallel with the subject of the ancient philosophers. Her finger at her mouth suggests she is requesting silence, and since she is paired with the yelling baby (probably a little boy), cat. no.  A.17-1954, it seems likely that the meaning of this piece is  a representation of restraint and temperance, as opposed to uncontrolled anger and frustration. It is notable that she lies unswaddled, whereas her partner is tightly bound to prevent him misbehaving. \n\nRasmussen also suggested these representations are secular versions of the Christ child; however this does not sufficiently explain why they were produced as a pair. He proposed in addition that they were made while L\u00fccke was in London (from 1757-60).  There is no strong evidence to support this, and it seems more probable that they are roughly contemporary with the ivory Prince Frederick as a baby, which is likely to date from 1753-5. The cap the little girl wears can be compared with that worn by the young woman in the Bode Museum, Berlin (Theuerkauff 1986, cat. no. 53 on pp. 199-200).",
