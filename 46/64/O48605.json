            "public_access_description": "This chair, designed by the architects Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown, has been celebrated for re-introducing decoration and historic form into contemporary furniture. The name of the chair refers to the designs of  Thomas Chippendale, the most famous British furniture designer of the 18th century.  Venturi used Chippendale's designs for chairbacks as an inspiration for this model but the materials, techniques and design of the chair differ radically from that of the 18th century designer.  \n\nThe chair is constructed of plywood, with a simple cut-out detailing on the back rest of the chair.  The laminate used to coat the plywood is decorated with floral emblems and what has been described by the design team as, an 'ant pattern'.",
