The whole costume, with the upright headdress and bold colours indicates the dominant Sister, danced by Andr\u00e9e Howard.   \nTwo additional designs, for the Prince (S.204-2000) and Cinderella (S.203-2000) in the ballroom scene are in the Cyril Beaumont Bequest.\n\nHistorical significance: An example of ballet design from the 1930s for the significant company Ballet Rambert.
