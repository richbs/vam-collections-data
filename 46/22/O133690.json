Studied art with the landscape painter John Vincent Barber in Birmingham, and settled in London 1828. Exhibited 139 works at the RA between 1828 and 1870, 80 at the BI 1828-55, and 46 at the SBA 1829-38. Early landscapes were principally in Wales, Yorkshire and Cornwall, then Ireland (after a visit in 1837), and coastal scenes after 1848. An early member of the Etching Club, many of his works were engraved. Commissioned 1851 to paint an extensive series of views in north Wales. Elected ARA 1842, RA 1851. Admired particularly in the later 1840s and 1850s for his truth to nature and the charm of his compositions; later works were criticised for being too dark and brown in tone. Occasionally worked in collaboration with other artists such as Richard Ansdell and W P Frith. Died Bayswater, London, 28 December 1869; his studio sale was at Christie's 6-7 May 1870. The <i>Illustrated London News</i> obituarist wrote that his life and work were 'comparatively monotonous and devoid of incident'. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1856, pp141-4, 1870, p53 (obit); <i>The Graphic</i> 8 January 1870, pp121-2 (obit with engr portrait); <i>Illustrated London News</i> 8 January 1870, p53 (obit with engr portrait); C Collins Baker 'Thomas Creswick RA and Mid-Victorian Landscape Painters' <i>Art Journal</i> 1908, pp104-7  \n\n<b>Mount Tom, Massachusetts, USA</b> \n580-1882 Neg GX2521 \nPanel, 17.8 x 25.4 cm (7 x 10 ins) \nJones Bequest 1882 \n\nAn engraving by J T Willmore in N P Willis's <i>American Scenery</i> ... (1840, II, facing p27) exactly reproduces this painting, and the lettering states that Creswick based it on a sketch by W H Bartlett. Most of the other illustrations in the two volumes were by Bartlett himself but a few were by Creswick after Bartlett. Mount Tom is situated at Easthampton, Hampshire County, West Central Massachusetts. \n\nThere is no evidence that Creswick ever visited the USA. In the present case the painting presumably was based on Bartlett's sketch; there are two slightly larger pictures in the Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, USA: 'Figures on a Balcony, Westpoint' (which also seems to relate in some way to the engraving after a drawing by Bartlett for <i>American Scenery</i> ... , and 'View on the Hudson River' (which was presumably the painting exhibited at the 1873 London International Exhibition (1268,23 x 30.5 cm/9 x 12 ins, undated)). Another oil, the same size, relating to a plate in <i>American Scenery</i>, is in the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool.\"\nVictoria and Albert Museum <u>Charles Dickens: An exhibition to celebrate the centenary of his death</u> London: HMSO, 1970. P.34. Catalogue of the exhibition held at the Victoria and Albert Museum, June-September 1970.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n'E11 [34] \n\nThomas Creswick, R A (1811-69) \n<b>Mount Tom, and the Connecticut River</b>\nOil on Panel. 7 x 10\n580-1882 (Jones Bequest) \n\nAfter leaving Worcester, Dickens joined the Connecticut River ad Springfield, just below the point seen in this painting. 'The Connecticut River is a fine stream; and the banks in summer-time are, I have no doubt, beautiful.'  So far, as is known, Creswick was never in America. He elaborated this oil painting from a sketch by W.H. Bartlett: it was then engraved as an illustration to <i>American Scenery; of Land, Lake and River </i>by N.P.Willis, vol. II, London, 1840, facing p.27 (see E13, 14).'",
