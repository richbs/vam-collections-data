            "public_access_description": "This is the offical jubilee medal, made by L.C.Wyon after models by Sir J.E. Boehm and Sir F. Leighton, in 1887.\nAlthough it was the official jubilee medal of which over 4,000 were struck in bronze between 1887 and 1889, this was very poorly received. The portrait of the Queen after a model from the life by Boehm, was generally disliked. Wyon used the same portrait for the obverse of the gold and silver jubilee coinage, but it was so unpopular that a new portrait was incorporated from 1893 onwards - also engraved by Wyon but after a portrait by Thomas Brock, R.A.\nThe medals housed in red leather cases were issued at the following prices: fine gold \u00a313.13.0d; fine silver \u00a32.2.0d; bronze 10/6d.\n\nThe jubilee was celebrated throughout the country. The festivities took many forms including local F\u00eates, a yacht race round the island from Southend to Dover, bonfires, illuminations and a service of thanksgiving attended by the Queen at Westminster Abbey. The Queen also received 88,000 volunteers, the navy consisting of 135 vessels and 20,000 men. In Hyde Park a large number of poor school children gathered to watch balloons ascending and to receive gifts of bun, milk and a jubilee mug.\n\nThe original owner of these medals, Captain Fowke of the Royal Engineers, became a distinguished official architect in the middle of the Victorian era, and published a number of related papers. In 1857 he became an inspector in the Science and Art Department in London; in 1860 was added the office of architect and engineer; while in 1862 he was appointed Superintendent of the construction of the South Kensington (now Victoria and Albert) Museum. He designed the new Museum of Science and Art (now the Royal Scottish Museum) Edinburgh, as well as extensions at the National Gallery, Dublin. He planned the buildings for the International Exhibition of 1862. Shortly before his death he designed the Royal Albert Hall.",

Formerly owned by Captain Francis Fowke, R.E.\nThis medal was one of seven of the collection (A.11 to A.17-1976) charting the career of Captain Fowke.\n\nHistorical significance: Although it was the official jubilee medal of which over 4000 were struck in bronze between 1887 and 1889, this was very poorly received. The portrait of the Queen after a model from the life by Boehm, was generally disliked. Wyon used the same portrait for the obverse of the gold and silver jubilee coinage, but it was so unpopular that a new portrait was incorporated from 1893 onwards - also engraved by Wyon but after a portrait by Thomas Brock, R.A.\nThe medals housed in red leather cases were issued at the following prices: fine gold \u00a313.13.0d; fine silver \u00a32.2.0d; bronze 10/6d.",

The Queen also received 88,000 volunteers, the navy consisting of 135 vessels and 20,000 men. In Hyde Park a large number of poor school children gathered to watch balloons ascending and to receive gifts of bun, milk and a jubilee mug.",
