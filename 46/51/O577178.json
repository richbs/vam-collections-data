On one level, it works as a straightforward fashion drawing, showing off the tailored skirt suit in striped wool and the striking turban hat which extends into a draped scarf about the shoulders. The face of the sitter however, appears to be more of a portrait as it shows more personality than is usually seen in fashion drawings, where generic pretty or stylized faces are usual. As this drawing was found in the combined archives of the couture houses of Worth and Paquin, the sitter is almost certainly wearing one of Worth's or Paquin's tailleurs. While the sitter could be someone associated with the business, such as a model or designer, it is possible that she is a French theatre or film actress who would have been well-known at the time.",
