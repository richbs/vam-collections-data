One-piece jumpsuits with wide trouser legs were very popular in the 1960s for informal evening occasions, such as at-home entertaining. More extrovert young women followed the glamorous example of Emma Peel in the hit television show The Avengers. Portrayed by actress Diana Rigg, Mrs Peel wore jumpsuits while going about her day-to-day business.\n\nJacques Heim launched his couture business in the 1920s. In the 1940s he was one of the first couturiers to sell ready-to-wear clothing in boutiques. In 1957, Heim struck a deal with the London manufacturer R. L. Salmon Ltd. They bought the exclusive rights to reproduce Jacques Heim's Paris collections for a British audience. Twice a year, the couture house sent them sketches and materials for Spring or Autumn collections. The final results were approved by Heim before the clothes went to high-end London boutiques.",

Salmon Ltd. This was a London dress manufacturer who acquired exclusive rights to make and sell the couturier Jacques Heim's designs in London from 1957. In most instances, R.L. Salmon Ltd used the French fabrics that Heim recommended, and Heim always approved the end product.\n\nThis design could not be found in any of the five pattern books available, which were Spring and Autumn 1966, Spring and Autumn 1967, and Autumn 1968. It is most likely from Spring 1968, or it could post-date 1968. It is unlikely to pre-date 1966.",
