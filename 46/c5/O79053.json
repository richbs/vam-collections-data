In the 18th century, in fashionable circles, breakfast was usually eaten in the bedroom. From the 1730s, such tables were designed to include storage for the breakfast things, so they could also be used for writing and reading.\n\nDesign\nThe table has two hinged flaps to provide an extended surface for the breakfast tray and a drawer to accommodate paper and writing equipment. The lower shelf is recessed to accommodate the legs of the sitter. It is enclosed in wooden fretwork which creates a decorative effect, although Thomas Chippendale (1718-1779) suggested the use of brass wirework as an alternative. The servant could thus see the used breakfast things and remember to clear them away later in the day. The legs are on castors so that the table can be easily moved and stored against the wall when not in use.\n\nOwnership & Use\nThe breakfast table which Chippendale supplied in 1759 for John Stuart, Earl of Dumfries (died 1814) has a drawer fitted out with a sliding writing surface and with divisions for pen, paper and ink.",
