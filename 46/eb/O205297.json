They were often as decorative and valuable as the rest of the owner's jewellery, and were worn visibly in the same way.   \n\nThe scissors in this filigree case were intended for sewing or embroidery.  The case is made of filigree, which was so widely used in Europe in the 19th century that it was considered synonymous with traditional jewellery of all kinds.  The owner would have worn it hanging from her belt by a cord running through the loops at each side.  The lid is not attached to the case in any way, and the cord would also have prevented that from becoming detached and lost.  Although this case was acquired as an example of traditional Italian peasant jewellery, it would have been equally acceptable to any fashionable Victorian woman in England.  European filigree work was very popular in the 19th century.\n\nIt comes from Romagna, and was bought as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
