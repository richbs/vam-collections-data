The reason for the name is unclear - it may simply be to celebrate the hops grown widely in the region.\n\nThe design is clearly related to aristocratic necklaces of the 18th century.  By the mid-19th century this specific shape, with an additional loop at the front separated by a filigree crown, with a bow and pendant pearl below it, had become fixed as part of the traditional costume worn in the Nuremberg region.  The short lengths of chain, and the loops at each end, which would have been fastened by a velvet ribbon, made it suitable for any size of neck. \n\nIt was bought for \u00a31 15s 5d at the International Exhibition, London, 1872.",
