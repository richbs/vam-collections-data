After retired from Malayan Civil Service in 1935 he was appointed lecturer and then reader in Malay at the School of Oriental and African Studies, London.\n\nHe started as a Cadet in the Federated Malay States civil service in 1902 and was posted to Perak where he studied Malay language and culture.  He spent 10 years in Perak and wrote four books in a government-published series called \u201cPapers on Malay Subjects\u201d.\n\nIn 1909 he wrote about Malay Industries: Arts and Crafts with a chapter on Malay gold and silver.  It was during his time in Perak that he met fellow colleague, R.J. Wilkinson, a distinguished Malay scholar, also a collector of Malay silverware.\n\nIn 1912, due to ill health he took home leave and returned back to London.  On 11 June 1912 Winstedt lent his collection of 68 examples of Malay silversmiths\u2019 work and weapons that he collected in Perak in 1902-12, for exhibition at the V&amp;A for a period of 12 months.  The loan had then been extended and finally Winstedt offered his whole collection to the Museum as gifts in 1958\n(museum numbers, IS.28 to 81-1958).",
