English travellers often purchased their lace abroad, and Brussels lace was also readily available in London, at considerable expense. Lace for cravats could be purchased either by length or by the piece, made to shape, as this one has been. A matching pair of cravat ends would have been attached to a length of fine linen, or muslin.",

            "historical_context_note": "At the beginning of the eighteenth century lace industries across Europe experienced a severe slump, particularly those producing heavy needle laces. The grand and elaborate dress of the French court began to be simplified, the high headdress known as the frelange disappeared, and lace cravats, ruffles and flounces were to a large extent abandoned. Such fashionable accessories were now of plain muslin. The gradual revival was led by the Flemish industry, which perfected a bobbin lace with the softness and draping qualities of muslin combined with rich patterns based on contemporary woven silk design, as can be seen in this cravat end. It left behind mesh grounds, and was now worked with patterned motifs closely juxtaposed, and open areas excluded. Its success was based on a combination of dense and complex design and exceptionally fine thread. \n\nTwo new technical characteristics were developed in Brussels lace in the early eighteenth century,  the working of raised edges along some of the pattern parts, and the adoption of a distinctive delicate hexagonal mesh ground, known as drochel (although Brussels lace grounded with bars continued to be made). \n\nAmong the items of fashionable dress for which lace was used by men in the eighteenth century, cravats were a focus for the display of wealth and good taste. The bib-fronted cravat was a feature of formal dress until the middle of the century, and was also worn by women as part of riding dress. Designs for cravats were  influenced by woven silk designs, but their size allowed enough space for pictorial motifs, which often included chinoiserie. The other important costume accessory often made of lace was the sleeve ruffle, part of both male and female dress.",
