Socketed candlesticks made their appearance in the late 13th century and gradually replaced the earlier pricket form, at least for domestic use. The earliest sockets were polygonal in cross-section; by the 15th century they were round. \n\nThe form of the stem and base of candlesticks at this time is the result of a complicated interplay between two typological currents. The first type naturally evolved from the simple European pricket candlestick, where the shaft is supported on three legs. The second type originated in the Near East and had a high cylindrical or slightly conical base surmounted by a flat circular wax pan and a short circular stem. These candlesticks were introduced into Europe by the Muslim community in Venice from the 14th century. \n\nBy around 1650, the wax pan was becoming increasingly distant from the foot. The unmistakable trumpet-shaped candlestick, cast in two sections with its wax pan appearing halfway up the column, is an example of this. The body is hollow cast and thus the corrugations serve to strengthen the shaft.",
