After the first obligatory prayer he drank coffee in the company of some choice friends, and next sat in his 'darbar' at 7am to transact the affairs of the State. . . After two hours he retired into a closet with some of his favourite friends and his nephews, Shahamat Jang and Saulat Jang, and his grandson Siraj-ud-daulah. For one full hour he amused himself by listening to verses and stories. . . ' (Sarkar [1973] II, pp.447-8). None of 'Alivardi's companions were of his own calibre. Saulat Jang had been for a short time a hopelessly unsuccessful Deputy Governor of Orissa. Shahamat Jang, 'a sickly imbecile', was Governor of Dacca until his death in 1755. Siraj ud-daula, 'Alivardi's favourite grandson, was even by the most favourable account an utterly depraved character. He is usually remembered in the annals of British India as instigator of the Black Hole of Calcutta, although it is unlikely that he was personally responsible for this over-publicized event.\nPublished: Skelton [1956] fig.3, pp.12-13",

The city of Murshidabad assumed a new importance and a new name early in the eightenth century, when Murshid Quli Khan was appointed Mughal governor of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa, and made Murshidabad the administrative capital of the province in sucession to Dacca. A most able administrator in that time of disintegrating central government, he was also a devout Muslim whose austere and frugal disposition made him an unpromising patron of the arts. Robert Skelton has, however, demonstrated that under this nawab and by about 1720 Murshidabad may already have attracted some of the court painters displaced by the decline of Mughal patronage at Delhi, and become the centre of a new school of provincial Mughal painting which was to achieve its definitive state under Nawab Alivardi Khan some thirty years later. Robert Skelton notes the influence of late Aurangzeb period court paintings on the formal style and sombre colour scheme of early Murshidabad work, anticipating the 'grey precision' which characterises Murshidabad painting of the mid-eighteenth century.",
