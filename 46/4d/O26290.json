Each player is to be furnished with one pyramid or marker and four round counters of the same colour.\n\nTo learn addition:\nUse but one teetotum, spin it and whatever number it turns up, move your traveller to the space so numbered.  Let the other players do the same.  When you spin it again, add your fresh number to your former one:  thus if your former place was six and your fresh number 5, they together make 11, move there, spinning thus by turns, till one person gets 100.  If a player's last spin carries him beyond 100, he does not win, but is to return as many on this side as he had got beyond; thus if his number would carry him to 108, that being 8 too many, he must return to 92, continuing so backwards and forwards, till someone hits the game exactly.  Whenever a player comes to a picture, he must look at the list, to see how to proceed.  When told to stop 1, 2, or 3 turns, he must put down so many counters, and when his turn comes, instead of spinning, he must take one up.\n\nTo learn subtraction:\nThe general rules of the game are as before, only both teetotums are to be spun.  Two numbers will then arise, take the least from the greatest, and move with the remainder.  If for instance, the numbers 7 and 4, subtract 4 from 7 and 3 remains, to number 3 you must go; if the next 9 and 5 arise, subtract and 4 remains, which added to you former place brings you to 7.\n\nTo learn multiplication:\nMultiply the two numbers which arise, move with the last figure of their product, neglecting the other: thus if 5 and 9 appear, multiplied they make 45 - use the 5 and neglect the 4.\n\nTo learn division:\nDivide the greatest number which come us by the least, observe how many times the latter is contained in the former and how many remain, add these together and move with their sum.  Five and eight are contained one and 3 over; 3 and 1 is 4, move there.\n\nThe compartments containing pictures, such as a cake, tiger, sentry, peacock, are not numbered although they fit into the numerical sequence.  The sheet of rules has a list of the penalties or benefits to be gained by a player who lands on a picture.\n\nRules placement: to the left side",
