This consisted of painting a compound of silver on the back of the glass. After firing in a kiln, the silver compound would turn yellow. Parts of many church windows in the Middle Ages were painted with just this simple silver stain and brown-black pigment. This highly popular method of decoration carried on well into the 16th century.\n\nThis fragment of decorated glass depicts a spray of stylised five-petalled flowers on a stem. The yellow petals are stained on the reverse of the glass and the details painted on the front in brown pigment. This fragment most likely was part of a trefoil-shaped (three-leaved) tracery panel of glass, which would have originally occupied the very top of a window in a church.\n\nThe religious conflicts that affected the British Isles in the 16th and 17th centuries had a devastating effect upon the decorative arts and furnishings of the Christian church. Much of the medieval stained glass in churches and cathedrals was damaged and only survives in a fragmentary state.",
