The design was executed for a production of Massenet's opera \"Manon\" performed by the English National Opera at the London Coliseum, January 24th 1974.  The opera was translated by Edmund Tracey, and the production was directed by John Copley.  The scenery was designed by Henry Bardon; the lighting was designed by Robert Bryan; and the choreographer was Pauline Grant. The production was subsequently revived at the Coliseum in September 1974, and extensively toured various English provincial theatres during the springs of 1974 and 1975.  \n\nThe production was later revised with some new costume designs by Alix Stone at the London Coliseum on April 12th 1979.  This revised version was subsequently revived at the Coliseum in February 1980, February 1982, and October 1984.",
