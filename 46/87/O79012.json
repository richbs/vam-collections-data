One of the panels includes the arms of Sir William and Lady Kingston.\n\nHistorical Associations\nSir William Kingston (died 1540) was a Knight of the Garter and the Comptroller of the Royal Household. In 1524 he was appointed Constable of the Tower of London. He received Anne Boleyn, second wife of Henry VIII, into custody at the Tower in 1536, just before her execution.\n\nTime\nBy the 1530s, classical ornaments were widely used in decoration. They were derived from Italian ornament and would have been described then as 'Romayne' or 'Antique'.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe background of this oak panel has gouged out and filled with chalk and verdigris (a greenish blue substance that forms on copper and brass). This practice was well known in north-east Italy from about 1400, but a novelty in England.",
