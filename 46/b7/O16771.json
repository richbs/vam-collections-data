            "public_access_description": "The glass of this splendid presentation beaker has a wheel-engraved decoration attributed to the Nuremberg glass engraver Hermann Schwinger. This has been achieved by holding the glass against small and fast rotating copper wheels, fed with water and an abrasive powder. Wheels of different sizes are used to cut a pattern into the glass surface. It takes great skill to engrave the flowing lines of the calligraphic inscription on the beaker. The engraver has cut and polished a small lens in the opposite side of the beaker, through which the inscription can also be viewed.\n\nIt is not quite clear when the silver-gilt foot and final in the shape of a god have been added. The foot, which replaces the original glass foot which was of a similar shape and size, has a Nuremberg hallmark. The dog bears an engraved monogram 'I.A.V.' and the year '1656' on its collar. As this date is slightly earlier than the date of the glass and its engraving it is likely that the year is commemorative of an earlier date or that the dog was originally made for an other objects and later re-used as a finial on this beaker.\n\nThe splendid mounts as well as the fine wheel-engraving elevate the status of this object to a special presentation glass, used at very special occasions.",
