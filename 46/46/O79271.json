The hinged attachment of the (missing) wire, and the circular design, with a ring of hollow beads round the edge, are common in some kinds of Balkan earring.  The use of filigree and the comma-shaped pendants hanging from the lower edge are both typical of all kinds of Turkish jewellery.\n\nIt was bought for 6 shillings and 6 pence at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
