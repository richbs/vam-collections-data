This is an early style tractor as it does not have a cab and so the driver would have been exposed to the elements. Some detail has been added to the toy tractor but it has not been that closely modelled on the original. The main difference is that the toy tractor is depicted as white and red, whereas the original tractor was red, silver and black. The original tractor by Massey Ferguson also had a tall exhaust sitting on the bonnet that was vertical and would have stood quite high above the bonnet. The toy tractor does not have this addition. This is a build it yourself kit with a battery in the centre. Paper instructions are included.",
