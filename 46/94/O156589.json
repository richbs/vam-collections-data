Salvers this size were also used to carry gloves and, later, visiting cards. The maker, Paul de Lamerie, was the son of French Huguenot parents and came to London in the 1690s as a small child, before going on to become the most successful Huguenot smith in the city.\n\nWhen the Catholic King Louis XIV revoked the religiously tolerant Edict of Nantes in 1685, Huguenots (French Protestants) were forced to leave the country. Many were craftsmen who settled in London.  Their technical skills and fashionable French style ensured the luxury silver, furniture, watches and jewellery they made were highly sought after.  Huguenot specialists transformed English silver by introducing higher standards of craftsmanship. They promoted new forms, such as the soup tureen and sauceboat, and introduced a new repertoire of ornament, with cast sculptural details and exquisite engraving.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver,  mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",

Congreve inherited the estate of Aldermaston from his wife in 1762.  The arms on the dexter side - 'Gules, a chevron between three battle axes' - have presumably been engraved in error for 'sable'. A similarly engraved salver of 1744 by the same maker is illustrated by Phillips (1935, pl. CXLIV)  Another pair of waiters with the identical border, hallmarked for 1747, was in the Anson collection (see cat. no. 71, p. 276) and was sold at Christie's in 1965 (June 16, lot 30). The pair differed from this waiter only in having a flat-chased band of scrolls and leaves within the border. Another pair of 1745 is in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, and an enlarged version of the same design was used for a pair of salvers of the same year from the Mountrath collection (sold Sotheby's, New York, June 6, 1980, lot 27) (Schroder, 1988, p. 222).\n\nProvenance: Ralph Congreve.
