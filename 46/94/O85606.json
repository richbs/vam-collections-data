His hands are raised  in abhayamudra.   He is wearing a dhoti and  a dupatta passing over the left shoulder.   The face and nearly the entire surface of the fragment are badly damaged.  On the head one can still recognise a very high usnisa and on the right shoulder the remnants of a necklace. Judging by the princely garb, it could be the representation of Bodhisattva Siddhartha.  Two kneeling worshippers on either side are damaged.  In the spandrels above the caitya arch, on each volute, stands a warrior with a shield on his left arm and a lance in his right  hand.",
