Hope at the Oxford New Theatre in December 1962. It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years. Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn\u2019t needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nPeter Butterworth came to show business relatively late after a career in the forces when he appeared in a concert in a prisoner-of-war cam during the Second World War. He appeared in many children\u2019s television programmes in the 1960s and 1970s, becoming popular as a shy, bumbling and endearing comic character.",
