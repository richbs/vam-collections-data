The tea service was made by the French royal porcelain manufactory at S\u00e8vres. The fluted design is called 'cannel\u00e9', and was used on a range of S\u00e8vres teaware shapes from 1754. The fluted sugar bowl was first introduced in 1764, so represents the latest fashion.\n\nThe set was probably put together by a luxury goods merchant, or marchand-mercier. The merchant would have ordered the veneered box, lined with watered silk, and probably bought the porcelain directly from S\u00e8vres. The slop bowl, which would have been used for the dregs from cups, is very unusual in a French tea service of this date, and suggests the set may have been put together with its English client in mind.",
