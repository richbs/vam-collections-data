It would originally have had a cross or Saint-Esprit hanging from the end of the pendant at the front.         \n\nCrosses are the most distinctive element in French traditional jewellery.  Every French woman had one.  They usually wore them on a black velvet ribbon, fastened tightly round the neck like a choker, with a slide at the front.  The ribbon passes through the bale of the cross, and is then threaded through a hole or loop at the base of the slide, and out at either side, leaving a long strip of ribbon hanging down between the choker and the cross.  This necklace imitates the appearance of such a ribbon, but is a much more decorative and ostentatious object.  Although it is unmarked, marks on similar pieces show that they were usually made in Paris.",
