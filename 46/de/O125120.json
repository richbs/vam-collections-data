On the occasion of Queen Victoria laying the foundation stone for this new building in 1899 it was renamed the Victoria and Albert Museum to commemorate the support given to its foundation by the Prince Consort. \n\nA pen and ink drawing of the Brompton Road frontage in 1906 by Louis Weirter in the collection (D.655-1906) shows scaffolding covering the whole of the front of the museum, including the dome, whereas in this painting the dome appears to be free from scaffolding.",
