The jewellery worn in towns, which is often Ottoman in style, is frequently very different from that worn by the nomadic Bedouin, whose characteristic silver jewellery is much better known today.  \n\nThis pendant was described as a \u2018hirz\u2019 when it was acquired by the Museum.  The word \u2018hirz\u2019 means an amulet case, and refers to the triangular plaque at the top which is shaped like the most common type of traditional amulet case.  Although there is no possibility that this piece could have contained an amulet, the shape alone was considered sufficient to act as a defence against evil powers.  It was bought for two shillings and six pence at the International Exhibition, London, in 1872, as an example of traditional Syrian jewellery.",
