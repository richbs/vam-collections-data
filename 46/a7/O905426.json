No date, but several water marks, one a design of a horn with 1797 below it ; also the name J. Corbett.   In original mottled cover and leather back.\nE.10-36--1898.\n\n<b>Summary of Contents.</b>--Nut crackers, button hooks, dog couples, huntsman's swivels, saw sets, pliers, hand vices, pinking iron, bed wrenchers (<i>sic</i>), bodkins, tweezers, toast forks, key swivels, skates, carpenter's tools, garden tool sets, sadler's tools, hammers, compasses, sugar cutters and the like.\n\n<b>Comments.</b>--This catalogue is singularly like M. 63. m. (<i>q</i>.<i>v</i>.) but the numbers are different, and as will be seen some different articles are illustrated.   It is particularly interesting because there is what appears to be a private discount mark on the front cover (Lr/x), and, throughout, prices are written in against the illustrations, in a private mark, the cyphers being represented by letters.   Thus on one plate it is recorded that \" A compleat sett of Sadler's Tools ax/x.   Do., if in a Oak Chest t/s/x/x.\"   A Matthew Ross, a tool forger, was in business in Church Street, Birmingham, in 1770, and others of that name are to be traced in 1808, when Ross &amp; Co. traded in steel toys in the same city.   There were tool makers of the same name in other parts of Birmingham about this time, which fact suggests that Matthew Ross had sons who followed his trade.\"\n",
