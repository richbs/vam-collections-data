In earlier dynasties (7th - 13th centuries), ivory was mainly carved into small personal accessories and ornaments. Later, it was also thought that ivory was suitable for Buddhist images as it was associated with 'the west' (South and Southeast Asia) where Buddhism came from to China. Carvings of non-religious figures appear to have more recent origins, and are made purely for decorative purposes.\n\nThis figure of a lady is carved into the natural shape of the elephant's tusk. Cracks appear in some places, which is typical of the deterioration ivory is vulnerable to.",
