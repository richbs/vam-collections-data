The Tale of Peter Rabbit (Frederick Warne, 1902) is her most famous and best-loved tale.  \n\nThis is a detailed illustration of the garden of Buckle Yeat in Near Sawrey, Cumbria (Linder 1987, p.169). Beatrix placed her character, the dog Duchess, on the path reading a newly received letter, when the illustration appeared in The Tale of the Pie and the Patty Pan (1905). Her love of the village of Near Sawrey can be seen in the energetic depiction of details within the village: the carts, the shop fronts and the local lady passing by on the road in front.",
