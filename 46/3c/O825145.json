Volume I. 14th-16th century</u>, London, 1979, p. 20 The following is the full text of the entry: <i>after</i> PERUGINO, PIETRO (c. 1445-1523) 15 St Anthony of Padua standing and reading a book, with a bishop or abbot at his side Inscribed on the back in pencil in Bernard Webb's hand 'Wellesley and Knowles Collection. Perugino' Pen and ink and wash, the outlines in the figure of St Anthony strengthened by a later hand in black chalk 10 \u00bc x 5 1/4 (260 x 133) E.4023-1919 PROVENANCE Dr H. Wellesley: (sale, Sotheby, 25 June 1866, lot 1096, as by Timoteo Viti, 'a monk, full length, a book in his hand, a bishop apparently listening to him,6 x 10 1/2 in', bought by Salting); Salting (presumably George Salting); Sir J. Knowles (sale, Christie, 27 May 1908, lot 158, as Perugino, from Wellesley Collection, bought by Webb for \u00a33); Bernard H. Webb Bequest 1919 The figure of St Anthony corresponds with the figure of the same saint in a drawing in the Uffizi (no. 108; O. Fischel, 'Die Zeichnungen der Umbrer' in <i>Prussian Jahrbuch</i>, 1917, p. 22, pl. 6, and <i>ibid</i>, Beiheft no. 1, p. 28, no. 27). Another drawing in the Uffizi, a copy after Perugino, shows the same figure again (illustrated in Fischc1, <i>lac. cit</i>., p. 22, fig. 23). Neither of these drawings shows the second figure of a bishop or abbot. The inference is that our drawing was probably copied from another drawing, or possibly from a lost painting.",
