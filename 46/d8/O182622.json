The main border has a large red flower and 4 red buds bending to the left with 4 green leaves hanging from below the flowerhead. This motif alternates with a small red flower on a rooted green stem with 2 leaves.  The large motif is sometimes too big for the border and the head of the flower is cut off by the inner border [see the lower right hand corner].  The main border is quilted with a diamond pattern. The centre panel is quilted with a diamond pattern. A green band forms a lobed medallion with red spots; there is a rosette in the centre.  A green 8-pointed star with small green leaves encircles this and links 4 large red blossoms in profile and 4 round red blossoms.  A pair of green serrated leaves and a red trefoil outlined with green emerge from the top of every blossom. There is a small red tree at the cardinal points with a pair of red birds.  A quarter of this design is in each corner. The ground has bands of offset floral sprigs with a red flower and 2 buds and a stem of red leaves curving over to the left alternating with a small red pointed flower on a stem curving to the left. All face towards the central horizontal axis. \nBacking: pieced, seamed down the centre; There is a piece-end marked by a white line between 2 brown ones. Yellow ground with offset rows of a floral stem with 2 buds and 2 leaves.  There are interesting inconsistencies in the placing of the block which seems to have measured 11 cm in width, and inconsistencies in the colours.\nFringe: green silk looped fringe from a woven heading. Two types have been used - one section is lighter in colour.",
