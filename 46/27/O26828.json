Each set shows four members of a family, such as the Bellows family or the Plank family.  The object of the game is to collect as many complete families as possible\n\nRules:\nHOW TO PLAY:\nThe cards are shuffled and the whole pack is dealt.  The players pick up their cards and look at them.  If a player has a set of four characters from the same family he lays these cards face upwards in front of him.  Then play begins.\nThe player on the left of the dealer plays first.  He decides which cards he needs to complete any sets he has in his hand.  If, for instance, he needs Miss Plank to complete a set of the Plank Family, he asks one of the other players whether they have Miss Plank.   If that player has the card, he must give it up.  Otherwise he replies, \"Sorry, not at home\".  A player who is successful in obtainingthe card he wants continues to ask for cards from any player until he receives the reply \"Not at home\".  It is then the turn of the player who has said \"Not at home\" to ask any other player for a card.  Play continues until all the cards have been collected into families.  The player who has collected the largest number of families is the winner.",
