The garments were worn by Edwin Hollis Perks (birth registered 4th quarter of 1862) (according to the donor's mother 1864) and Bernard Perks (birth registered 2nd quarter of 1866).  They were the sons of Samuel H Perks, proprietor of an edge tool manufacturing firm in Wolverhampton, and his wife Emma: the elder son seems to have been known as Hollis when he was a child and as Edwin when he was older.  There are copy photograps of the boys showing Bernard wearing T.221-1968 and Hollis wearing T.222-1968).",
