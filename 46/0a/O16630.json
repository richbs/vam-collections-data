Four of the lobes, in the positions North, South, East and West, are set with human heads. Another four (at the lesser points of the compass) are set with bosses. In between each boss and human head is a lobe that would have held a gem (now missing).\n\nAbove each of the gem settings is a design of a passant lion. In between the lions are small niches outlined with corded wire. Two of the niches contain animal masks, perhaps of a lion, which protrude in the style of a gargoyle. The other six niches contain hollow circular stems. These may have once contained similar animal masks, or perhaps more gems.\n\nThe upper half of the ornament displays four more beasts in a similar fashion to the lions below. There are two griffins of different design, a dog and a leopard. Niches, which contain animal masks similar to those below, separate these beasts.\n\nThe boss is decorated with an openwork arcade of corded wire. A roundel at the top of the ornament shows a smith sitting in front of an anvil holding a hammer and forging a bar of metal which curves outwards at the end.\n\nOn the back of the ornament, each lobe carries a spiraled design. There are also two hoops of different shapes for hanging the ornament.",

Decorated as it is with male heads, lions and griffins, it is likely to have been owned by a man of considerable status.The empty sockets must once have held gemstones. Both lions and griffins were linked with valour and prowess, and their images often decorated medieval princely objects.",

Described on acquisition as the 'cover of a goblet'.\n\nHistorical significance: This object is unique of its kind. The smith may be Wayland the Smith; the motif has no known parallel in 12th or 13th century goldsmith's work.\n\nEvans considers this piece as an example of the changing styles in Germany and Scandanavia in the tenth and eleventh centuries. The brooch 'keeps the traditional round form, bossed like a shield, but elaborates it into a composition of real beauty. The lobes and bosses, though they keep something of the traditional arrangement of the earlier brooches with knobs of bone and garnet, are all treated in pure goldwork.'",

There are no traces of wear or solder such as would have been created by a hinged pin and it must therefore either have been worn suspended from a lace or sewn into position. The prominence of the lion suggests that it was a man's ornament.",
