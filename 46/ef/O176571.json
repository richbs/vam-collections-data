Charles Tracy noted that this bench end and W.94-1911 correspond in style with those at Stowlangtoft and Barningham in Suffolk, and must be of the same workshop. Given the proximity of both parishes to Bury St Edmonds, and the date given to the Stowlangtoft benches (1450-1500), an attribution to an unidentified Bury workshop seems reasonable.",
