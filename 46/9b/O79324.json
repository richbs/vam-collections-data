It was described as a modern Egyptian hair pin.\n\nIt may have been acquired in Egypt, but hair pins like this were not worn with any traditional costume in Egypt at that time.  It is more likely that it was put together for western visitors.  It may have been made in the Yemen, as the filigree disc which forms the head rests on a Yemeni tut bead, and was probably a pendant in a Yemeni necklace itself.",
