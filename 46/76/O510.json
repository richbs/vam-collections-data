They used soft enamel colours and operated in their own homes. Once painted, the wares were taken to a glass factory or larger central workshop, where the colours would be fired onto the surface in special kilns. The most popular enamel colours were black and red, based on lead oxide and iron oxide respectively. \n\nThe painters used contemporary prints as source of inspiration for their work. The elaborate ornament on this beer tankard has the C- and S-shaped scrolls typical of the Rococo style.",
