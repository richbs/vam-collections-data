At the end of the 19th and beginning of the early 20th century, Orvieto was undergoing  a great deal of construction. The newly centralised Italian government was investing in the re-development of long-term economically deprived areas in the country. Orvieto, and the Umbrian region in which it is located, had been in economic decline since the plagues of the 14th century. The government authorised the removal of  the old water systems in Orvieto in preparation for bringing in piped water. Many wells were demolished and a great deal of ceramic material, such as this dish, was coming out of them.\n\nSuch early tin-glaze was little known at the time and, as Orvieto was one of the first areas in which such material was being discovered, the term 'Orvieto ware' became applied to this simple green and brown painted dull tin-glazed ware. Also, as the ceramics were coming out of unstratified contexts, dating of this material was quite arbitrary. No other early Italian tin glazed ceramics had been studied so it was considered by the first scholars of this material that it must be late but obviously pre -Renaisance as it was not as brightly-coloured nor on a brilliant white ground as the material known from the latter part of the 15th and early 16th centuries. Many scholars just assigned an arbitrary 15th century date to this material.",
