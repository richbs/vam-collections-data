The legs are separately attached and under the belly is a plate covering the clockwork\nmechanism. The movement of the horse consists of small forward leaps; rather like the mechanical pig. The winding key is integral. Riding the horse is a comic figure of a man in a tailed coat with top hat and an umbrella. The head and legs are loosely joined so when the horse moves they flop about. The figure rather resembles a Spanish horseman with grey hat; coat and spats; black trousers and boots and a red umbrella; the face has a black beard. Some of the paintwork is damaged. \n\n*It may be that the horse was made in the 1900-14 period; however; the design continued into the 1920s. The painting rather than the use of a\nlithographed surface suggests an earlier date.",
