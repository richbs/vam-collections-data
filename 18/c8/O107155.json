The costumes for Journey to Avalon, which took its theme from the Arthurian legends, were brilliantly conceived.  Although the action of the ballet was narrative rather than imaginative, her costumes eschewed realism and gave it the timelessness that such a theme needed.  Dressing the men in basic body tights, subtly coloured and dyed, she added tattered panels of metallic knitting, which, when stretched over the body, suggested worn and battered armour and hinted at the gradual disintegration of the Camelot ideal.",
