            "public_access_description": "This stand or gu\u00e9ridon was made as a fake in about 1860-80, imitating the porcelain-mounted furniture that was so fashionable in France a hundred years earlier.  The stand itself is of poor quality, but the porcelain plaque on the top is interesting because it has been made from a raised porcelain stand or soucoupe \u00e0 pied, originally used to hold ice-cream cups or arragements of dried fruits on a dinner table. This has had its foot cut and ground off to make it into a flat plaque. A French scholar has recognized the pattern of gilded sprigs of redcurrant, as the decoration for a service that was made at the S\u00e8vres porcelain factory in France from 1763, for use by the King at the Chateau de Fontainebleau.  Only one service of this pattern was made, so the identification is certain. Pieces were provided over a number of years. Soucoupes \u00e0 pied were only listed in the records of the factory in 1768, when two were provided.  Presumably, it is one of these that has ended up on this piece, although the marks that would identify it for certain have been cut off in turning it into a furniture mount.",
