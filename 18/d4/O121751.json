Such papers had emerged in the late 18th century but the fashion lasted into the 1830s. \u2018Drapery\u2019 papers are so-called because they were designed to produce a trompe l\u2019oeil effect: when hung they appear to be swagged and pleated fabrics rather than printed paper. The design of this deep border would have been modelled on the design of contemporary pelmets, and it would have been intended to complement panels of wallpaper designed to imitate draped or pleated fabric held in place with gold braid or tie-backs. This design includes imitation moulded gilt borders which frame the white satin fabric. The grey background has been printed to imitate watered silk. The manufacturer of this paper has not yet been established but it is in the style of the papers manufactured in Paris by Dufour.",
