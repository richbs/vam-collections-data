            "public_access_description": "Charles M'Gee was born in Jamaica in 1744. He was a sailor in the British navy, and after his discharge he settled in London, working as a crossing-sweeper at Ludgate Hill near St Paul's Cathedral. Crossing-sweepers kept areas of the streets clear of rubbish and horse manure. They earned their living from the tips given by those pedestrians who depended on the crossings to keep their shoes and clothes clean. \n\nThis print was published in Vagabondiana (1817), a collection of prints of well-known London beggars and street traders first published as a folio of prints in 1815-1817. The author and artist John Thomas Smith was particularly interested in life in London. Another of his works is The Cries of London, published in 1839, after his death. The 'Cries' were originally the calls of street traders and hawkers selling their wares. They became a rich source of inspiration for British musicians and artists, particularly in the 18th and 19th centuries.Vagabondiana fits into this tradition, and the inclusion of real-life black personalities such as M'Gee reflects the historical presence of many black men among the London poor, and the fact that this was recognised in mainstream publications of the time.",
