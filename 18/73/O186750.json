Just like other British artists abroad, Soane found it much easier to cultivate the acquaintance of wealthy British Grand Tourists as potential future clients. Soane claimed to have established such a friendly connection with Henry Bankes. According to Soane it was Bankes who suggested to the architect the idea of transforming a Doric temple into casino 'retaining the general character of the exterior of the ancient edifice'.\n\nThe origins of the commission suggest that it was set as a mathematical problem for Soane to solve. This is borne out by a series of variants of later date in which architect tried vainly to retain the peripteral character of the ancient temple, while carving the interior space into rooms on several levels.   \n\nThis charming perspective view by Charles James Richardson, Soane's assistant from 1824 to 1837, displays tighter than usual draughtsmanship and bestows an unwarranted credibility upon a little dream structure.",
