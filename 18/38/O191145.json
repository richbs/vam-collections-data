The slogan is a critique of the ineffective economic policy of the communist era. It proclaims the party\u2019s stance against the curtailment of private enterprise.  \n\nThe Social Democratic Party had a respectable past, but had disappeared from the political scene in 1948 (after merging with the Communist Party).  In 1990 it had no leaders of any real authority had difficulty in redefining itself. There are three formulas on this poster representing the party: the full name of the party, the carefully designed abbreviation SZDP and the old nickname \u2019szocdemek\u2019. The main line of the text imitates graffitti, suggesting that the poster is speaking on behalf of the ordinary people on the street and a broad circle of the population.\n\nThe full text on the poster reads: 'We have had enough of the new and the new burden. The tax on interest is unlawful. Hungarian Social Democratic Party'.",
