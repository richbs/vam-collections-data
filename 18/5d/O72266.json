            "public_access_description": "Jamal Shah was born in 1956 in Quetta, Balochistan, Pakistan. The artist established the Fine Arts Department at the University of Balochistan and headed the department for three years. In 1985 he formed the Artists Association of Balochistan and became the first Chairman of Artists Association of Pakistan. He later obtained a Masters in Fine Arts from the Slade School of Art, London. \n\nIn the centre of the print a male figure performs a Paktun (Khatak) dance in the rain. Rain did not appear in Jamal Shah\u2019s work before his visit to London in 1988, but he uses it here as a sign of hopefulness rather than depression. A group of children in the foreground and a feeding chicken are recurring images in his prints. They may be seen as a symbol of the street life of Pakistan. The section of design and piece of printed text taken from a Sotheby\u2019s auction catalogue may refer to modern western perceptions of Islamic art.",
