The fabric has either been patched or was torn and has been re-stitched near the seam.  The design for the border was drawn in black ink on the reverse; the original design was more complex than the one that was embroidered.\nA circular or curved octagonal cover. Light yellow ground, a central 8-rayed star form in blue infilled with either a light pink cartouche or a composite geometric motif, around a white, brown and pink lozenge.  From alternative star points a large light blue cartouche joined to a part octagonal form in blue containing an octagonal pink star around a white centre. Stylized leaves, rosettes and S-forms infill all these motifs.\nThe border is light blue containing S-shaped motifs in pink and greenish-brown.  All the motifs were originally outlined in black silk.\nThis piece does not lie flat.\nEmbroidery threads: 2S silk; yellow, white, very light blue, light blue, blue, black, greenish-brown, green, light green, two faded shades of pink.",
