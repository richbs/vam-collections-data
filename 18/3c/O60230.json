            "public_access_description": "The church of San Giorgio dei Greci is a Greek-orthodox church begun at the end of the XVth century by the architects Mauro Codussi (1440-1504) and Sante Lombardo (1504-1560). It was completed in 1561 after a design by Giannantonio Chiona. The drawing depicts the  three-level fa\u00e7ade. The first level has a front door decorated by an arched low-relief surmounted by a pediment resting on four columns. On each side, there is a bow window surmounted by a pediment. The second level is decorated with three tondi with a bust of figure and above a large circular window flanked by two niches. The last level looks like a large broken pediment with a small compartmented window flanked by two niches. This third level half hides the cupola located right behind.  \nAntonio Visentini (Venice, 21 Nov 1688 \u2013 Venice, 26 June 1782) was an Italian painter, engraver, architect and theorist. He was first known as a painter and trained with the Venetian history painter Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini (1675-1741). He became known as an engraver by the end of the 1720s when he was commissioned by Joseph Smith to produce engravings of Canaletto\u2019s views of Venice. Visentini started working as an architect in 1731, and his first theoretical work, Libro di Architettura, which included Rococo-influenced drawings by Pier Antonio Morelli after Visentini\u2019s ideas, was published in 1733. \n\nHis ideas on contemporary architecture derived from Antiquity and the work of Andrea Palladio (1508-80). Later however, Visentini developed neo-Palladian and anti-Baroque ideas. Visentini and his pupils executed numerous drawings of ancient and contemporary buildings intended to disseminate exemplary architecture. He participated to the foundation of the Venetian Academy in 1755, where he became a teacher of architectural perspective in 1772.",
