The goddess first appears in sculptural form relatively late, around the sixth century, only after the tenth century in multiarmed tantric forms.  She seems to have been adapted from a Hindu goddess of the same name.\nThe sculpture bears a striking resemblance to reliefs of yakshis, including Ambika, at the Navamuni caves at Khandagiri, near Bhuvaneshwar, Orissa, datable to the eleventh or twelfth centuries (Tiwari 1989, pl.58).  Local inscriptions from the mid-eleventh century refer to new images being set up at this time, which suggests a renewed interest in Jainism in Orissa in the twelfth century.\n\n<u>Dehejia, Vidya (ed.)
