The upper section of the interior is fitted for sliding trays, which no longer survive, and a later hanging rail has been inserted. Underneath are two short and two long drawers.",

The original sliding trays have been replaced by a hanging rail, below which there are sets of drawers.\n\nPlace\nTwo Norman Revival style castles designed by the same architect were built  in the 1820s. Gosford Castle, County Armagh, Northern Ireland, was built in granite in 1819-1820, for Archibald Acheson, 2nd Earl of Gosford (1776-1849), whose wife was an heiress. Penrhyn Castle, Bangor, North Wales, was built in stone, 1821-1841, for George Dawkins Pennant (1764-1840), who made his fortune from slate quarries. While Penrhyn survives, with much of the original furnishings intact, the contents of Gosford were sold in 1921. This wardrobe was probably made for Gosford, since it does not resemble any of the Penrhyn furniture.\n\nPeople\nThomas Hopper (1776-1856) trained as a surveyor, and his first major commission was the Gothic Conservatory he added to Carlton House, London, 1807, for the Prince Regent. He established himself as a country house architect, working in various styles, including the fashionable Greek Revival at Leigh Court, Somerset, in 1814. Admired for his Norman-style castles of Gosford and Penryhn, he may also have designed the large amount of furniture required, which probably included this wardrobe.",

However the style of the wardrobe is quite different to that of the surviving furniture at Penrhyn and it may have been made for one of the Norman Revival castles built in Ireland. One possibility is Gosford Castle, Co. Armagh, Northern  Ireland, designed by Hopper for the 2nd Earl of Gosford and built 1819-20. A later commission, Glenstal Castle, Moroe, Co. Limerick, originally designed by William Bardwell for Matthew Barrington, was built from 1838 but not completed until after 1849. No records have been found so far to confirm the orginal provenance of the wardrobe.\n\nPurchased from Mount Street Galleries, London.\n\nThe wardrobe was owned by the dealer, Christopher Gibbs, who bought it in about 1958 from another dealer, Terence Morse. Gibbs had the wardrobe in his flat at 100 Cheyne Walk, London, before selling it to Mick Jagger for his house, Stargroves, East End, Newbury.",
