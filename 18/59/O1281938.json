A tiny compass is inlaid into a perspex window, behind which a recessed front compartment contains a series of miniature found objects including a hand holding a swinging pendulum and a pair of die. The themes of life as a journey and the chances we take are implied even before the box is opened. The book it contains opens to reveal a kind of pocket prayer book for the soul. The pages unfold in a complex, map-like structure and contain map imagery and a sequentially numbered text that helps us to navigate around the 'twists and turns of the human heart'.",
