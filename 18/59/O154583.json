            "public_access_description": "This portrait group of a mother with her two children is an intriguing painting, with no information now available apart from the contents of the image itself. Judging by the female dresses, it is an Ottoman subject and the family might be wealthy Greeks, Feneriotes, who lived in the Fener district of Istanbul. Others have suggested that the rather bulbous turbans worn by the mother and daughter might be Armenian instead. The problem is that so few paintings of this period and type of subject survive, so it is difficult to make comparisons. The painter\u2019s style is fairly similar to that of Raphael the Armenian, Court Painter to the Sultans Mahmud I, Osman II, and Mustafa III, and our painter was possibly a member of his circle. \n\nCloser inspection of the picture reveals more details of their lives. The walls of the room are lined with what is probably a French silk and the table is a fashionable rococo marble-topped side table, imported from France. The sofa is Ottoman in design but the silk covering it is probably imported as well. Children of the wealthy were often dressed in miniature versions of their parent\u2019s outfits. The boy is wearing an outfit normally worn by a terjuman, a dragoman or interpreter at the court of the Sultan, with a very distinctive fur-trimmed hat and robes. As this was a kind of uniform at court, there is therefore no clue as to which community his father the interpreter actually belonged. He must have been a rich man, to afford the expensive imports of French furnishings. This image reminds the viewer that trade and the exchange of fashionable ideas in design between the Ottomans and France and Britain went on virtually uninterrupted from the sixteenth century until 1914 and the final days of the Empire.",
