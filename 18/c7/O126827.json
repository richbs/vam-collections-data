Cat. no. 100, p.175, illus.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows: \n \n\u2018100 \n<i>Tintern Abbey</i>, 1835  \n \nWatercolour, gouache, brown ink \nand black chalk on white laid paper, \n36.8 x 48.6 cm (14 \u00bd x 19 1/8 in) \n \nLit: Lister 233; Woof and Hebron 1998, \nno. 112  \n \nLondon, Victoria and Albert Museum,  \n1902-1919 \n \nPalmer\u2019s 1835 letter from Tintern  \n(<i>Letters</i>, pp.71-3) includes a rapturous  \ndescription of the local landmark: \u2018such  \nan Abbey! the highest Gothic;  trellised  \nwith ivy, and rising from a wilderness of  \norchards, and set like a gem amongst the  \nfolding of woody hills\u2019 (<i>Letters</i>, p.71).  \nPalmer made four studies of the late  \nthirteenth-century Cistercian ruin (Lister  \n233-6), three of which are known. The  \npresent drawing shows the south-west  \nview, the tracery of the west front\u2019s  \ncentral window framed by ivy, and the  \nWye river (out of sight) behind. As with  \nother studies from about this time,  \nPalmer enriched central areas of the  \nsheet while leaving outer portions unem- \nbellished. The sketch at the base remains  \nundeveloped, but the middle and upper  \nportions of the design have been progres- \nsively worked: washes of pink and green  \ndistinguish roofs and foliage, lines of  \nbrown ink elaborate architectural details,  \nand a pale grey tone designates the sky.  \n \nIn 1783 William Gilpin had teasingly  \nproposed the \u2018judicious\u2019 use of a mallet  \nto remove the \u2018disagreeable\u2019 gable-ends  \nthat \u2018confound the perspective\u2019 in the  \nabbey\u2019s cross aisles (Gilpin 1783,  \npp.32-3). But Palmer took a nostalgic  \nview, more in the spirit of Wordsworth\u2019s  \n\u2018Lines composed a few miles above  \nTintern Abbey\u2019 (Woof and Hebron 1998,  \np. 103-7). Palmer revelled in the unclas- \nsical architecture, lingering over the  \nslight asymmetry of the tracery as if to  \nemphasize its Gothic craftsmanship and  \nthe passage of time. He expressed his  \nfondness for such qualities in his letter:  \n\u2018I feel here a most grateful relaxation  \nand become once more a pure  \nquaint crinkle-crankle goth \u2013 If you are  \na Goth come hither, if you\u2019re a pure  \nGreek take a cab and make a sketch  \nof St. Paul\u2019s Covent Garden before  \nBreakfast (<i>Letters</i>, p.71).'\nLister, Raymond. <u>Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9 of the Works of Samuel Palmer</u>.
