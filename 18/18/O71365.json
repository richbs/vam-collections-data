            "public_access_description": "Works by the Conceptual artist Joseph Beuys (1921-1986) take many forms. A number of them involve the use of felt and fat, a reference to a traumatic experience in his youth. In 1943, while serving in the German Air Force, his aircraft crashed in the Crimea in winter. He was rescued by nomadic Tatars, who treated his wounds with fat and wrapped him in felt to keep him alive. In this print and its pair in the V&A (E.945-1981), he pays tribute to his rescuers with the symbolic image of the felt suit (which was an actual garment made by Beuys and which reappears in other works) and a cross that recalls both selflessness and survival kits.",

            "bibliography": "Timmers, Margaret (ed), <i>Impressions of the Twentieth Century: Fine Art Prints from the V&A's Collection</i>, London, V&A Publications, 2001\nThe full text of the entry is as follows: \n\n\"<b>Joseph Beuys (1921-86)</b> \n\n<i>Druck I</i> (Print I), 1971 \n\nBeuys' art stemmed partly from his desire to achieve political and social revolution through creative discourse.  This led him to produce a body of work, including large print editions and three-dimensional objects, as part of this process.  When asked in an interview with J\u00f6rg Schellmann and Bernd Kl\u00fcser in 1970 why he produced multiples, Beuys spoke of the need to reach a larger number of people than he might by producing unique works or none at all.  He also used them as a means of staying in touch and prompting further enquiry and debate.  Beuys' multiples included many types of objects (prints on paper were just one form), and he incorporated materials as diverse as felt, fish bones and enamelled tin. \nThis print, one of a pair paying tribute to the people of Eurasia, recalls the profound significance for Beuys of a region where he perceived materialism as kept in check by more spiritual values, arising from a particular life style and a close relationship with nature.  As with so much of his work, the image reproduces objects that both commemorated and grew out of his experiences in the Second World War.  The cross brings to mind both survival kits and religious belief.  The felt suit, which had itself been made up as a multiple by Beuys, symbolized the protective qualities of the original felt and fat in which he had been wrapped and kept alive by the (Eurasian) Tartars of the Russian Steppes after his place had crashed in their territory in 1941. \nDuring his potentially controversial visit to the USA in the late 1970s Beuys scattered sulphur over his installation <i>Aus Berlin</i>.  As Robert Morgan explained in <i>Who Was Joseph Beuys</i>, 'In alchemy, sulphur is considered to have remarkable transformative powers that could heal and reconstitute matter and give it new depth and substance.  <i>Aus Berlin</i> was an installation, but it was also a process and a performance, a statement about potential unity and reconciliation.'  The second print, the image of which duplicates that of the first, is printed with glue and powdered sulphur to imply the same kind of 'transformation' from one state (signified here by conventional letterpress) to something more.  From his considerable scientific knowledge Beuys would have been aware that sulphur's inflammable quality and its capacity to generate heat - the production and channelling of energy was for Beuys a lifelong concern.  It is also intriguing to note the existence of large deposits of sulphur round Dagheston - close to the region where Beuys was cared for by the supposed enemy.\"",
