Whall taught his pupils glass-cutting, painting and leading. They included many women who went on to establish themselves as highly respected stained-glass artists. Veronica was one of them.\n\nAs early as the age of 13, Veronica contributed a design for a window depicting St Catherine for the Lady Chapel of Gloucester Cathedral. This was her father\u2019s most important commission, begun in 1897. The windows are his acknowledged masterpiece.\n\nDuring the First World War (1914\u201318) Veronica worked as a designer in her father\u2019s studio. In 1922 she became co-director in the new stained-glass firm of Whall & Whall Ltd. She carried on the business with her brother after their father\u2019s death in 1924. Their commissions included windows for Carlisle and Leicester cathedrals and works for churches in New Zealand and Australia.\n\nVeronica Whall described the making of stained glass: \u2018The three things technically essential to the making of a stained glass window are glass, lead and light . . . for light is our medium, and light is our colour\u2019.\n\nThis panel of a trumpeting angel was made about 1925. The scroll contains a passage from the Gospel of St Matthew recounting Jesus Christ\u2019s words at his Ascension: \u2018[I am with you] even unto the end of time\u2019.",

            "historical_context_note": "Veronica Whall (1887-1967) was the daughter of the influential Arts & Crafts stained glass artist Christopher Whall who was also a teacher in the progressive art schools of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Whall taught his skills in glass-cutting, painting and leading to his pupils who included many women who went on to establish themselves as highly respected stained glass artists. Veronica was one of these women artists.\n\nAs early as the age of 13, Veronica contributed a design for a window depicting St. Catherine for the Lady Chapel of Gloucester Cathedral. This was her father's most important commission (begun in 1897) and the windows are his acknowledged masterpiece.\n\nVeronica was working with her father in his studio during the First World War as a designer. In 1922 she became co-director with her father in the new stained glass firm of Whall & Whall Ltd. She carried on the business with her brother after the death of their father in 1924. Their commissions included windows for Carlisle and Leicester Cathedrals and works for churches in New Zealand and Australia.\n\nVeronica Whall described the making of stained glass as:\nThe three things technically essential to the making of a stained glass window are glass, lead and light\u2026for light is our medium, and light is our colour.\n\nThis panel of a trumpeting angel was made in about 1925. The scroll contains a passage from the Gospel of St. Matthew recounting Jesus Christ's words at His Ascension:\n\t(I am with you) even unto the end of time",
