London: The Stationery Office, 1997.\nCat.96, pp.176-177. Full Citation:\n\n\u201c<b>96 Unknown Man </b>\n<b>c.1650 </b>\nP47-1941 \n\n<b>Oval 59 x 48.5 mm </b>\n\nFeatures in brown and sanguine, hatched diagonally with blue-grey, heavily impasted with gouache, and with black and touches of white and ochre in the eyes, on a thin, warm carnation ground; hair in dark brown washes with grey gouache in the curls and highlights, also over the carnation; costume in black, modelled and with the lights in grey gouache; background a plain greenish wash, hatched with darker colour to right, and apparently darkened in the margins; on vellum relaid on pasteboard (see below). \n\n<b>Condition:</b> The original support for the vellum, which would have been pasteboard or table-book leaf, is missing. This has resulted in flaking, especially in the hair, which thus misleadingly appears to have many small lights, an effect deliberately increased by a 'restorer' scratching out more paint in order to even out the distribution of lights; many unretouched losses in the face, costume and background. Vellum laid on to pasteboard and the surface stabilised, December 1975. \n\n<b>Signed:</b> Not signed. \n\n<b>Frame:</b> Nineteenth-century gilt-brass rim of narrow half-round section, with a toothed copper closure strip soldered to the back, bent over the miniature which is inscribed: <i>NO.II / French period / of Louis 13th / unknown</i>, with the printed label of the Magniac Collection, numbered 312. \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> H Hollingworth Magniac, his sale ('the Colworth Collection'), Christie's 5 July 1892, lot 312; Samuel S Joseph; given to the Museum by his widow, Mrs Emma Joseph, May 1941. \n\n<b>Literature:</b> <i>Accessions</i> 1941, p. 60 ('possibly English of the school of D Gibson\"): Summary Catalogue, 1981, p. 24. \n\nThe miniature was not referred to by J C Robinson in his review of the star pieces in the Magniac Collection. The description given in the Christie's sale catalogue probably derived from Magniac himself - 'a Gentleman, of the court of Louis XIII' , and this was adapted by the Josephs into 'French School, 17th century'. Carl Winter followed this without comment in his cataloguing of the Joseph miniatures, adding the date c.1660. Reynolds and Mayne would have been responsible for the entry in Accessions 1941, suggesting correctly the association with the artist known as 'D Gibson'. \n\nThe appearance of the miniature, owing to damage and creative restoration, is somewhat misleading. From what can be seen with certainty of the basic technique, however, the hand is certainly English and seems to be Gibson's, comparable with work somewhat earlier than the main corpus of \u2018Carnarvon' miniatures in the late 1650s, such as the <i>Unknown Man</i> signed <i>DG</i>, datable on costume and hair c.1650.1 The latter appears to represent Gibson's style near the beginning of his career as a miniaturist. \n\nThis miniature is technically close to this, but since the sitter is in 'undress' the miniature is harder to date on costume and hairstyle. The hair is the sitter's own, worn at cavalier length; he has a waxed moustache and a minimal tuft of beard below the lower lip; he wears no linen collar, but there seems to be a small section of shirt visible, open-necked, beneath the cloak. This is not conventional costume for English portraiture, but there seems no reason to suppose that the sitter is French. Magniac opted for a date c.1640, Wnter for c.1660, but both, in detecting a hint of Gascon swagger in the image, evidently sought to place the miniature within an ethos of antipuritanical informality. Perhaps Gibson's association with Pembroke and Carnarvon from the late 1640s into the 1650s, which provided the context for Lely's Arcadian image of Gibson and his wife, provide also a context for this sitter, c.1650. To my eye this is easier to accept than a date in the 1660s, when Gibson's style was less austere and when this image would have seemed old-fashioned and colourless. \n\n1 Sotheby's 29 March 1976, lot 21, repro. My technical notes on this read: 'The features in firm brown and sanguine, hatched diagonally, and with the usual blue-grey gouache impasto, on top of a warm, pale pinkish carnation: hair in brown wash, hatched over with darker brown and with rough, rather blotchy gouache lights: background a pale greeny brown wash, hatched with darker colour.'\"\n<u>Victoria and Albert Museum, Department of Engraving, Illustration and Design and Department of Paintings, Accessions 1941</u>, London: HMSO, 1954.\nThe full text of the record is as follows:\n\n<b>'ANONYMOUS: 17th century\n</b>\n\nMiniature portrait of a man wearing a black cloak. Mid-17th century.<i>\nOn parchment on card. Oval.</i>\nP.47-1941\nGiven by Mrs. Samuel S. Joseph.\n<i>Note:</i> This miniature is possibly English, of the school of D. Gibson.'",
