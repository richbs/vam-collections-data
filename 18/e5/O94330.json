The stylistic and iconographic relationship of ivories and manuscripts illustrates well the close connection between works produced in different media in one place. A second comb, in the Mus\u00e9e de la Princerie in Verdun, was probably executed in the same workshop but by a different hand.\nThe unusual prominence of the scenes of the Massacre of the Innocents, the Adoration and Dream of the Magi and the Last Supper is striking, and was probably the result of a directive of the patron.\nLiturgical combs were used by priests or bishops for liturgical functions. Its use symbolises the concentration of thoughts towards the liturgy.",

On loan to the City Museum, Gloucester, after the second World War; again on loan to the V&A, 1967-77; accepted from H.M. Treasury in lieu of capital transfer tax after the death of Miss Lloyd Baker, in 1977.\n\nHistorical significance: The crowded compositions with rather stiff figures, mainly seen in profile, are related to the St Albans Psalter, executed c. 1120-30 at St. Alban Abbey, now in the Dombibliothek in Hildesheim. The stylistic and iconographic relationship of ivories and manuscripts illustrates well the close connection between works produced in different media in one place. A second comb, in the Mus\u00e9e de la Princerie in Verdun, was probably executed in the same workshop but by a different hand.\nThe unusual prominence of the scenes of the Massacre of the Innocents, the Adoration and Dream of the Magi and the Last Supper is striking, and was probably the result of a directive of the patron.",
