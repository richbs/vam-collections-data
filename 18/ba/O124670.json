Essentially, Hill posed and arranged the individual sitters or groups while Adamson attended to the technical aspects of the exposure, processing, and printing.\n\nSome of their most powerful images, however, were made in Scottish seashore villages and depict fishermen and women. They also photographed  the architecture and monument of Scotland  and made calotypes of their friends posed in medieval armour or costumes.",
