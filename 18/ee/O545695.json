Van Somer in fec et ex Londini (or variations thereof) M and numbered 3, 2 and 4.\nThree plates bear traces of the address of J. Nicholls.\nVAM (E.1451-1983)\n\nThe most complete recorded copy of this work (Winterthur, NK 1530. B78) consists of this title and plates, with one addition, and 4 more suites, each with a title. They are made up of 27 plates by Van Some, J.L. Durant, C. de Moelder, Mersonau after Berain (including Berlin 1939, 344 (1), 753, 838). All the titles but two, and all the plates, are reissues of continental baroque plates, in most cases previously published in London by J. Nicholls. Two of the title-pages are made up by Bowles from elements taken from various suites by Toro. The present Toro plates are reversed copies of plates in Cartouches Nouvellement Inventez par J.B. Toro (Berlin 1939, 369 (12); Dimier 1928, 92.7). This title appears in John Bowles\u2019 Catalogue of Maps, Prints, Books and Books of Maps, 1728, p.34\nMS\"\n",
