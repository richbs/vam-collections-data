It is not possible to tell whether this print was based on a real person, or is an imaginary scene. However, there were significant numbers of black people in many British towns, particularly London and other ports, such as Liverpool and Bristol, by the end of the 18th century, so a scene like this would not have been uncommon. This man is shown earning his living from selling flowers. His wooden (peg) legs suggest that he may previously have been a sailor. The loss of one's legs was then an occupational hazard in the navy, when sea fights were mostly duels between cannon-laden, timber-built warships. Many black men served in the British navy in the 18th century.",
