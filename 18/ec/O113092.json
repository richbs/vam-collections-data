Born in Somerset as John Henry Brodribb, Irving began his professional acting career  at the age of eighteen despite parental disapproval.  In 1866, after working for ten years in the provinces, he came to the St James's Theatre in London as actor and stage manager.  He joined the Lyceum Theatre company in 1871, and that November his triumphant performance as Mathias in The Bells won him universal acclaim.  He assumed management of the Lyceum Theatre in 1878, beginning an association with the theatre that lasted for over twenty years.\n\nIrving's productions at the Lyceum were famous for their scenic effects, visual spectacle and the care and expense lavished on the set and the costumes.  This neck chain is surprisingly light, being carved from Irish bog oak, according to Raymond Mander and Joe Mitchenson, the great theatrical collectors who gave it to the donor who in turn presented it to the Theatre Museum.",
