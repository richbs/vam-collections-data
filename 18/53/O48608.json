They were placed on the tea table when tea was served and were decorated in a variety of fashionable styles.  Tea caddies traditionally had locks because tea had originally been very expensive. This particularly elaborate caddy was given to the Museum by the makers and has never been used.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe caddy is made of papier m\u0192ch\u201a, a substance made by either gluing paper sheets over a mould, or pressing paper pulp in a mould.  The article would then be dried in a kiln, hand-painted and varnished.\n\nPeople\nJennens & Bettridge  were the leading Birmingham firm of japanners, or makers of painted and varnished furniture and other objects.  By 1851 they were the leading manufacturers of papier m\u0192ch\u201a in England, with premises in Birmingham, London and, between 1851 and 1852, in New York City, USA. The firm made items for Queen Victoria and exhibited at the Great Exhibition of 1851, held in London. Their stand at the Exhibition included a tea caddy but we do not know if this is the same one.",
