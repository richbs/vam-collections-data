Early in his career he produced social and political caricatures of English life for popular publications such as The Comic Almanack and Omnibus. He went on to become a leading exponent in the art of book illustration and is generally accredited as heralding the golden age of children's book illustration. Among his most popular illustrated works are the first English translation of Grimm's fairy tales, German Popular Stories, published in two volumes by Charles Baldwyn from 1823-6, Sir Walter Scott's Waverley Novels (1836-8) and Charles Dickens' novels, Sketches by Boz (1836) and Oliver Twist (1838).  Most of Cruikshank's illustrative work was produced on copper, etched by himself. \n\nHis illustrative style went out of fashion in the 1840s but, inspired by the temperance movement, he continued to illustrate temperance tracts and folios of moralising prints, such as 'The Bottle' (1847) and its sequel, 'The Drunkard's Children' (1848). He remained an ardent social reformer throughout his life.",
