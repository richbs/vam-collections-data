After studying at the Royal Academy schools, (though failing his exams) he managed to exhibit with the Sark group of artists. On the strength of this he was offered a job at the Westminster School of Art. There he taught life drawing from 1935 until 1939. This study was produced as an example for students, and shows how he experimented with various textures in the thick gouache, and thinner watercolour washes. The image shows little hint of how his dark imagination was to develop in the illustrations he produced during and after the Second World War.",
