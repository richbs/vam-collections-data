The wording reads\nTODAY YOU'RE 7 \nwith the enlarged figure seven printed in a textured gilt pattern.   The inside of the card shows a camping scene with four boys and two tents: two of the boys are frying sausages over the fire, one is inside the pop-out tent in the middle and the fourth is bringing logs for the fire; the verse reads:\nWHAT'S COOKING FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY ?\nWHY, SURELY YOU CAN GUESS\nALL SORTS OF JOYS,\nWITH GAMES AND TOYS\nTO BRING YOU HAPPINESS.",
