Although described as 'printed chintz', by the 19th century this term was commonly used to describe any block printed cotton textile. Chintz actually involved many processes, involving drawing and dyeing rather than printing. The designs on this example were either stamped or stencilled. Many pieces similar to this were purchased from the 1851 Exhibition. At Sanganer, near Jaipur, Rajasthan, block printing was encouraged by the patronage of the Jaipur royal family. Printed cottons were also exported by the East India Company. Block printing is still practiced in Sanganer, using traditional seasoned teak wood blocks, known as chhapas or buntis.",
