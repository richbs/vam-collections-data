The front shows a pixie in a red cap and tunic and yellow leggings, with two children outside a house in a tree: the boy wears a blue and white buster suit, and the girl a yellow coat with red accessories; the wording reads \nHappy BIRTHDAY !\nwith the large figure three embossed and printed in gold coloured ink visible through a cut-out space in the tree trunk.  Inside is a vignette of a pixie carrying a plate with a cake, and the figure three with the words 'YOU ARE' above and 'TO-DAY DEAR' below; the verse reads:\nI hope you'll be glad, dear, the whole of the day, \nWith frolic and romping and friends in to play,\nAnd when it is tea-time, still wide, wide awake,\nperhaps you'll have candles and nice birthday cake !",
