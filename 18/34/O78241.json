The pattern was sold to G.P.& J. Baker, and was printed as a textile on a white ground in 1896.\n\nPeople\nLindsey Butterfield (1869-1948) was one of the most successful freelance designers of patterns who worked in the Arts and Crafts style. This design is in the Arts and Crafts style. Butterfield later went on to work for the Silver Studio, an influential design firm which produced many patterns for wallpapers and textiles up to the 1950s.\n\nDesign & Designing\nButterfield trained at the National Art Training School at South Kensington from 1889 to 1891 where he studied the underlying geometry of plants. This training resulted in a close attention to the detail of plant forms in his designs. He was also a keen gardener with a firsthand knowledge of plants, as this design shows.  Butterfield's early  designs were based on plant forms that were recognisable but subtly stylised, deriving their influence ultimately from designers William Morris (1834-1896) and C.F.A. Voysey (1857-1941).",
