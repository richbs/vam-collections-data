The central roundel and footrim are of lacquer on a wood or bamboo core, being lacquered black on the underside and vermilion on the outer surfaces. The petals, which were probably formed in a mould, are composed of greyish-black lacquer and ash composition, visible where the rim has broken off. This composition is covered with a layer of vermilion lacquer, as is the upper surface of the central roundel. \nIllustrated in: John Da Silva, 'A Small Group of Eighteenth-century Chinese Court Lacquers' TOCS 44 1979-1980, pp.67-72, plate 3.\nCompare the porcelain dish dated in accordance with 1774 illustrated in J.
