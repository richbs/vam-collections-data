It  is a curved  panel made of ivory silk, with multicoloured silk appliqu\u00e9s in the shape of flowers and foliage. It could have been made by Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 artist Natalia Goncharova, who worked for the House of Myrbor between 1922 and 1926. Goncharova (1881-1962) had a long career with Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, producing astonishing costumes which were inspired by her Russian background and her work as an avant-garde artist. Like many Russian refugees in Paris, she also designed dresses. These strongly reflected her work for Diaghilev. The House of Myrbor was an exclusive shop owned by the Italian Marie Cuttoli. It sold fashion, rugs and curtains designed by the international avant-garde.",

She established a salon which was frequented by writers and the military. She was considered to be one of the great international beauties, with extremely pale, almost transparent skin and golden hair. She was frequently the subject of articles in the New York Times during the early 20th century. Her clothes were purchased from couturiers in London, Paris, and New York, and demonstrated an elegantly avant-garde approach to style.",
