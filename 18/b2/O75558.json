The traditional Japanese garment, the kimono, had no pockets, and men first used inro to carry daily necessities. From the late 1500s onwards, men wore them suspended from their sashes by a silk cord and netsuke (toggle). However the inro rapidly became a costly fashion accessory of little or no practical use.\nMost inro are rectangular, with gently curving sides. From the 1750s onwards, craftsmen tried to find interesting and inventive ways to decorate the small surface. This example has an unusual hexagonal (six-sided) form. \nMany inro were made of lacquer because it was highly suitable for storing medicines. Lacquer is the sap from the tree Rhus verniciflua that grows mainly in East Asia. The sap was processed, and the lacquer worker would then apply it in many thin layers to the base material. The craft of lacquering, as well as making inro bodies, is highly complex, time-consuming and expensive. In this example, the maker has used the togidashie (brought out by polishing) technique. The lacquer decoration is completely flush with the ground.",
