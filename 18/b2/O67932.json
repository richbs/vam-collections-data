            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nThis is an 18th-century picture frame made for a print. The framer who made it used pinewood shaped into what is called a reverse section. This means that the most prominent section of moulding is closest to the print and the frame sweeps away downwards to the outer edge of the frame.\n\nThere is a special technical vocabulary for describing the separate parts which make up a complex frame moulding such as this. From the back edge (the outer edge of the frame, furthest from the picture) the mouldings are ovolo, bead, caveto, bead, caveto, sight edge (the inner edge of the frame nearest the picture). A bead moulding is a small half-round convex moulding like the profile of a bead on a necklace. A caveto is a concave quarter-round moulding, and an ovolo is a convex quarter-round moulding with narrow horizontal bands top and bottom. These mouldings are taken from elements of Classical architecture and would have been made using special woodworkers' tools called moulding planes. After shaping, the pinewood was then painted black.\n\nOwnership & Use\nThe 18th-century owners of prints presumably displayed them in frames in their home or workplace for the same reasons that we do today, because they admired the print, or the subject was especially meaningful to them. A glazed frame with a wooden backboard protects a print from damage by dirt, damp and insect attack. It also saves the print from the risk of getting torn due to rough handling.",
