During the 18th century, tea was made in front of family and guests in well-off households, not in the kitchen. Like other tea utensils, canisters were therefore often highly decorative. Initially an expensive luxury confined to the wealthy, tea became more widely drunk as prices fell during the 18th century. The gradual fall in price (before import duties were radically reduced in 1784) was reflected in the size of these containers. Worcester's canisters of this oval type, for example, became more bulbous and capacious.\n\nSubject Depicted\nTea was usually prepared by the lady of the house, with the help of a servant. The inclusion of a black servant in this scene was not only a touch of realism, but also an emblem of luxury, emphasising the cost and exotic associations of tea.\n\nMaterials & Making\nWorcester's raw materials included soaprock, which resulted in a type of porcelain that was resistant to the thermal shock of boiling water. Worcester's recipe was therefore suitable for tea and coffee wares.\n\nTrading\nWorcester sold much of its output through wholesale warehouses in London. However, it also disposed of some wares, including 'jet enamelled' wares of this type, through auctions attended by private buyers and merchants. In 1769 a 43-piece 'jet enamelled' tea service realized \u00a31 16s at auction.",
