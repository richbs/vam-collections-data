The field is decorated with  animals in combat against a background of trees.   The wide main border has a U-shaped meander dividing it into yellow/green nearest the field and pink towards the edges.  Along the upper and lower edges is a band of plainweave turned under and secured.  The pile is wool, the warp is green and the weft is pink; the backing is cotton. \nThe 16th century Persian carpet being copied was formerly in the Bardini Collection in Florence.\nChenille Axminsters cost about \u00a31-10/- per sq.yd in 1937, so this carpet would have cost about \u00a323. They were woven in batches of 36 with perhaps four or six batches woven per year.",
