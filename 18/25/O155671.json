Architectural motifs (pillars, chaitya windows and railings) are used to frame the figures appearing on the right pillar. Caparisoned elephants encircle the tops of each pillar. The brick stupa, covered with vegetation, appears behind the gateway, surrounded by a stone railing (vedika).\n\nOn the right side photograph, the two pillars have been photographed from the right. This shows the detail of a standing door guardian appearing in the bottom frame of the left pillar and a design of lotus flowers and vegetal scrolls appearing on the right pillar.",

Markings on the top of the buff-coloured mount indicate the way in which the object was categorised.\n\nHistorical significance: The hilltop site of Sanchi comprises the remains of stupas, temples and monastic buildings. Abandoned from the 14th century, Sanchi was 'rediscovered' by a British officer, General Taylor, in 1818. However, it was not until 1881 that restoration work was initiated. Between 1912 and 1919 the structures were restored to their present condition under the supervision of Sir John Marshall, Director General of Archaeology in India.\n\nThe Great Stupa (known as Stupa 1) at Sanchi is the most important and complete surviving monument of the Shunga era (circa 185-175 BCE). The original mound was a brick structure built by King Asoka during the 3rd century BCE. During the late 1st century BCE it was enlarged to twice its original size, the dome was encased in sandstone slabs and a walkway was constructed on the ground level and marked with a stone railing (vedika). A square structure (harmika) was constructed on top of the mound which contained a three tiered umbrella (chattravali), representing the three jewels of Buddhism - the Buddha, the dharma (ethical precepts of Buddhism) and the sangha (community of Buddhist monks). Four stone gateways (toranas) were built around the stupa, one in each cardinal direction. Each gateway comprises two upright stone pillars with three architraves, elaborately carved in relief with scenes from the Buddha's life and stories from his previous existences (jatakas).\n\nThe stupa form developed out of hemispherical funerary mounds, the earliest being used to enshrine the remains of the Buddha himself. Over time, stupas came to commemorate the Buddha's spiritual achievement, his enlightenment and teachings. Smaller stupas were built as votive objects at Buddhist holy sites, often clustered around larger stupas.",
