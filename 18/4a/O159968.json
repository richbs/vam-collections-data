There are cylindrical tankards with decoration on a speckled manganese ground which are like the one here but have what appears to be the letter 'F' painted on the bottom. This 'F' has been taken to stand for 'Funcke' but has not been supported by documentary evidence as yet.\nThe Order of the Black Eagle was founded in 1701 by Friedrich I, King of Prussia. The badge of the Order depicts a crowned eagle with one talon on a cross-enveloped globe and bearing the letters 'FR' (for Fredericus Rex) in monogram on its chest.",
