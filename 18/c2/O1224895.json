            "public_access_description": "Kyoung Soon Park was born in 1953 and graduated from Seoul National University of Technology. He is professor in the Department of Ceramics at Kookmin University, Seoul. He has exhibited in several exhibitions in Korea and abroad including \"Seoul Arts Fair\", and \"From the Fire: Contemporary Korean Ceramics\", 2004-2007, in the U.S.\n\nThe form was built up using both coils and slabs of clay. In this sculpture, the artist has covered the entire form with a first coat of dark coloured glaze and then applied, on some localised parts, other bright coloured glazes (yellow, green, purple). The contours of the motifs have been deeply incised using engraving tools. (a technique known as sgraffito).  This decorative technique has been used in the past in Korean ceramic tradition on one particular type of the Punch\u2019ong wares, from the Jeolla Province ca. fifteenth century. This piece is an example of how Korean contemporary artists reinterpret the old pun\u2019chong tradition and combine it with their own research and contemporary vision. The form draws its inspiration from, sotdae, the wooden pillar with a bird carved on the top, traditionally found at the entrance of Korean villages to bring luck and ward off evil spirits.\n\nThe piece was shown as part of the  exhibition Tradition Transformed  (  from 20 May to 3 October 2011 at the  V&amp;A ). Tradition Transformed   showcases the work of contemporary  Korean ceramic artists who combine  traditional methods with modern  ingenuity and innovative techniques.",
