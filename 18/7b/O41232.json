She received critical acclaim for an early series in which she captured the curtained proscenium arches of old fashioned cinemas (1994) on large scale, colour saturated prints. \n\n Glamour Studio (Bathroom Suite) was presented to the museum by BMW Financial Services Group in return for professional advice in 1998-1999.  It depicts a purpose-built bathroom suite set in a studio.  Part of a entitled Making Your Dreams Come True  the work results from a commission awarded by BMW Financial Services Group.  Of the work, Smith states 'I have chosen to photograph sets from the world of glamour photography, as play-acting seems such an integral part of dreaming.  Each set offers the potential of the viewer to enter a new role and to act out their own fantasies'.",
