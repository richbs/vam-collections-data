Frustrated by a lack of communication from Queen Victoria's government, back in 1864 Tewodros had taken a number of Europeans captive, including the British consul, Captain Cameron. The British response was a military expedition of huge complexity and expense led by General Sir Robert Napier. The expedition marched to Tewodros's fortress at Maqdala where a brief battle took place. Britain won the conflict, but not before the captives were released and Tewodros himself had committed suicide.\n\nThe expedition - and the characters associated with it - caught the imagination of the British public. In particular the figure of the Ethiopian emperor, variously described as a 'barbarian potentate', 'tyrant' and 'mad, wild king', was a popular focus. Yet Tewodros could also be portrayed admiringly as a noble warrior - an attitude which this image seems to reflect. The authenticity of the image is supported by its provenance; handwritten text on its reverse notes that it was 'taken from a sketch by one of the captives'.",
