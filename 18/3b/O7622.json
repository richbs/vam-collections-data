These are known as \u2018tracery lights\u2019. \n\nAngels, celestial creatures, figure prominently in many of the world\u2019s religions. Christianity inherited its devotion to angels from the Jewish faith from which it emerged. The angel in this panel has a set of six wings instead of two. This would identify him as a Seraph.\n\nFrom early on, the great theologians of the Christian church devoted much effort to identifying and understanding the role of angels in God\u2019s creation. About the year 500, one scholar wrote a treatise called \u2018The Celestial Hierarchy\u2019. He scoured the Old and New Testaments for information relating to angels. From this he compiled a list of different types of angels according to their functions. He claimed that there were nine orders of angels, divided into three hierarchies. Each order had a specific function, such as the Order of the Archangels, who act as messengers between God and mankind. The author of this treatise is known as the \u2018Pseudo-St Denis\u2019 or \u2018Pseudo-Aeropagite\u2019, because he was once thought to be the St Denis (or Dionysus) the Aeropagite who is mentioned in the New Testament Book of Acts.\n\nSeraphim encircle the throne of the Godhead and protect the Ark of the Covenant. They belong to the first hierarchy of angels, together with the Cherubim and Thrones. In medieval art the Seraphim acquired six wings in reference to the vision of the Prophet Isaiah (6: 2\u20137): \u2018I also saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up . . . Above it stood the seraphim: each one had six wings, with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. And one called to the other and said: Holy, Holy, Holy\u2019.",

These are known as 'tracery lights'. \n\nThe angel in this panel has a set of six wings instead of two. This would identify him as a Seraph.\n\nAngels, divine creatures, figure prominently in many of the world's religions. The Christian religion inherited its devotion to angels from the Jewish faith, out of which it emerged. \n\nFrom early on in the Christian church its great theologians devoted much effort to identifying and understanding the role of angels in God's creation. Around the year 500, a church scholar wrote a treatise called 'The Celestial Hierarchy'. \n\nThe author of this treatise, known as 'Pseudo-St Denis' because formerly he was thought to be St Denis the Aeropagite who is mentioned in the New Testament Book of Acts, scoured the Old and New Testaments for information relating to angels. From this he compiled a list of different types of angels according to their functions. He claimed that there were nine Orders of angels divided into three hierarchies. Each Order had a specific function such as the Order of the Archangels who act as messengers between God and mankind. \n\nThe first hierarchy of angels consists of Seraphim, Cherubim and Thrones. The Seraphim encircle the throne of the Godhead and protect the Ark of the Covenant. \n\nIn medieval art the Seraphim acquired six wings in reference to the vision of the Prophet Isaiah (6:2-7):\n\nI also saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up...Above it stood the seraphim: each one had six wings, with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. And one called to the other and said: Holy, Holy, Holy\u2026",
