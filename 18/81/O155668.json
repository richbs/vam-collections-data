Loosely woven cotton. There is a border on four sides with offset lozenges, each made-up from 8 triangles, so there is one or two half lozenges in the borders.  There is an openwork border around the whole lozenges.  To either side of the border is a narrow band with offset rows of straight stitches forming a pattern. The four corner units are formed of five parts: a small triangle with foliate motifs, band of pulled thread work, band worked into a pattern of holes, band of pulled thread work, band of reciprocal triangles.  The remaining sides of the central panel have a stepped pattern in straight stitches. In the middle is a square edged on 2 sides with this stepped pattern; the main border is reciprocal triangles and the centre contains an X-motif in pulled thread work creating 4 inward pointing triangles with a foliate pattern in straight stitches.  The field is covered with linked stairs forming a circular lattice.\nCotton Thread: white, Z-spun\nEmbroidery Thread: white silk; 2S",
