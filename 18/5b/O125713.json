An offer of marriage (Savoy). By Adrian Kunkler. In frame. Signed. Swiss. Dated 1855'; bequeathed by Rev. Chauncey Hare Townshend, 1868.\n\nHistorical significance: This painting was bequeathed by the Rev. Townshend who owned a large collection of 19th-century landscape and genre paintings. It is not unlikely that Townshend, who resided part of the year in Lausanne, acquired this painting directly from the artist.\nThe museum of Freiburg owns several of his works.",
