It is believed to have been a wedding favour for a bridesmaid at a 1887 ceremony. Measuring under 22 cm when opened, it is the right size for a young girl to carry.\n\nMany of the Museum's adult fans are luxury objects, with unique hand-painted designs and finely carved sticks. They would have been preserved for their beauty and workmanship. This child's fan, which is in fine condition, is a rare survival. It would have been mass- produced, with simply painted wooden sticks and a commercially printed paper leaf. The leaf is further accented with gilding and tiny metal sequins. The romantic scene depicting a shepherdess being politely courted by a well-dressed gentleman would have been appropriate for a bridesmaid's fan.",
