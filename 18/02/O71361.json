Since this Cornish family had numerous branches, and favoured the name Thomasine for its daughters, it has not proved possible to identify the exact owners of these plates with certainty. However, the apparent link between the Willeys of Cornwall and the Staffordshire Potteries may be explained by the fact that after 1816, Cornish cobalt (the blue needed for transfer-printing) was being supplied to the Spode factory and others. It is therefore likely that the Willeys were involved in the trade - perhaps mining cobalt or Cornish china stone - and either commissioned this plate or received it as a present.",
