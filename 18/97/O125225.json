            "history_note": "Bequeathed by Miss Agnes G. Simpson, 1974\n\nHistorical significance: Hawes Craven (1837-1910), the son of a comedian and an actress, became interested in theatrical scene painting at a young age. He attended the Government School of Design at the South Kensington Museum (later the V&A) from 1851-1853, where he won a number of prizes. On leaving the School of Design he was apprenticed to John Gray, scene-painter of the Britannia Theatre, Hoxton and later of the Olympic Theatre on Wych Street. \n\nFrom 1871 to 1901 Craven was the principal scene-painter at the Lyceum Theatre in London, working for the great actor-manager Sir Henry Irving. Their collaboration on grand productions resulted in some of the most spectacular and thoroughly researched scenery on the London stage. \n\nAs the inscription attests, this small landscape painting was painted for Alice Simpson, a friend of the artist, in July 1892. It was bequeathed to the V&A by her daughter, Miss Agnes Simpson.",
