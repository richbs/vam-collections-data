Most examples of this type of textile in museum collections are the decorative parts only, and we have to conjecture what type of garment or cloth the fragments might have belonged to. \n\nThese double bands are tapestry-woven in purple wool and undyed linen thread on a linen ground. The design of the bands features running animals including hares and lions in curvilinear compartments. Some of the animals' tongues are made in red wool.",
