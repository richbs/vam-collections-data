            "public_access_description": "Louis-Simon Boizot (d. 1809), sculpteur du roi, became Director of Sculpture at S\u00e8vres in 1773. This model was made in 1794, the year following the execution of Louis XVI and the subsequent transfer of the S\u00e8vres factory from royal to state ownership. It was also the year in which the National Convention voted in favour of the abolition of slavery, prompting numerous engravings celebrating the themes of civil rights and benevolence to all men and all nations. Nature is depicted nursing two children of European and African origin. The practice of breast feeding, although revived latterly by the aristocracy during the Ancien R\u00e9gime, came to symbolise the Republican values of equality and duty. This group is based on an anonymous engraving, entitled 'La Nature' attributed to Boizot, an example of which has survived in the Mus\u00e9e Carnavalet in Paris.  It was made at a particularly uncertain time for the factory, following the upheavals of the Revolution and preceding the new Empire, and is arguably one of S\u00e8vres' most important and accomplished productions of the period. \n\nAll the references to this shape in the S\u00e8vres archives date from 1794, 'an II' (year 2), in the Revolutionary calendar.  Three examples came out of the kiln on 2 messidor an II (20 June), with the comment that they needed to be refired. Three were in the 22 messidor firing (10 July, possibly the same ones), a further four were fired on 22 thermidor an II (9th August), and three on 21 fructidor an II (7th September). This means that either 10 or 13 were produced. This piece is thought to be the only surviving example and its clear political significance continues to resonate in the 21st century.",

Exhibition at the mus\u00e9e Lambinet de Versailles, 23 October 2001 - 24th February 2002. See catalogue entry no. 80, p. 232 for an anonymous engraving in the mus\u00e9e Carnavlet, entitled 'La Nature' on which this group is based. The attribution to Boizot is based on the similarity of the details of this figure found also in other engravings on the same theme, which also recur in the biscuit model. The iconography is linked to contemporary events and also to literature of the time (<i><u>Paul et Virginie</u></i> by Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre was published in 1788 and 1789). The S\u00e8vres clientele were apparently not very taken with the model as it is only to be found once in the sales records: 8 messidor, an III (27 June 1795) purchased by <i>citoyen</i> Le Couleloc Conteleu for 660 <i>assignats</i>.\nInternational Ceramics Fair &amp; Seminar 2009 handbook. pp 88-89. Advertisement for John Whitehead depicting the print source and this biscuit model, C.361-2009. Caption reads:'S\u00e8vres hard-paste biscuit group La Nature incised S, 1794, Height 9 1/2 inches (24cm). Once the Convention had voted to abolish slavery in 1794, a number of popular engravings were produced in celebration. Boizot turned some of these into biscuit groups. This one deals with the themes of equality and fecundity, and also incorporates symbols of the elements, a serpent for the earth, water-lilies for water, birds for air and smoke for fire.' This appears to be the only known surviving example.'",

            "history_note": "Louis-Simon Boizot held the title of Sculptor to the King and became Director of Sculpture at S\u00e8vres in 1773. This model was made in 1794, the year following the execution of Louis XVI and the consequent transfer of S\u00e8vres from royal to state ownership. It was also the year in which the National Convention voted in favour of the abolition of slavery, prompting numerous engravings celebrating the themes of civil rights and benevolence to all men and all nations. The source for the group is an engraving attributed to Boizot, entitled 'La Nature' depicted an allegorical figure of a woman nursing two children, one of European, the other of African origin. The practice of breast feeding, although revived by the aristocracy during the Ancien R\u00e9gime, came to symbolise the Republican values of equality and duty.  Another engraving with the same title, signed by Boizot (engraved by Jean Baptiste Gautier) is in the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale.  This depicts a different allegorical female figure, shown standing with multiple breasts, based on antique models of Diana (Artemis) of Ephesus.\n\nThis biscuit group was arguably one of S\u00e8vres' most important and accomplished productions of the period. It was made at a time when the manufacture's production was in decline, following the upheavals of the Revolution and preceding the new Empire.\n\nAll the references to this shape in the S\u00e8vres archives date from 1794.  Three examples came out of the kiln on 2 messidor an II (20 June), with the comment that they needed to be refired. Three were in the 22 messidor firing (10 July, possibly the same ones), a further four were fired on 22 Thermidor an II (9th August), and three on 21 Fructidor an II (7th September). This means that either 10 or 13 were produced. This piece is thought to be the only surviving example and its clear political significance continues to resonate in the 21st century.",
