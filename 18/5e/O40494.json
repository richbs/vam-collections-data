While she produced portraits and cityscapes she mainly worked as a landscape artist.\n\nThis drawing in pen and ink and watercolour is titled \"Roma\". Rome is the capital city of Italy. Acording to legend, it was founded over two and a half thousand years ago by the fathers of the Roman Empire, Romulus and Remus. From the first century AD until the 5th Century AD Rome was the capitol and centre of Roman Empire, which was until that time the largest empire the world had known.  In the right foreground of this watercolour Wilczynski has placed an antique urn full of red and blue flowers. To the left are two antique statues of women. These objects are set against an architectural background of ornate Corinthian columns and arches. This combination of architectural and sculptural elements along with a richly coloured bouquet of flowers the rich variety of sites and history encountered by the artist in the capital city of Italy.",
