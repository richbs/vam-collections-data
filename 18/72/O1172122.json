This was a combined album of two earlier ones, Little Feat and Dixie Chicken. It would have been designed to display on record shop counters or walls, where tickets could be bought for the tour. \n\nLittle Feat formed in 1969, a rock and roll funk band out of step with other Californian rock bands of the early 1970s. They were signed to Warner Brothers Records in 1970, but with little promotional push did not receive any recognition until their fourth album, 1974's Feats Don't Fail Me Now. They toured Europe as part of the Warner Bros Music Show, along with Graham Central Station, Bonaroo, Tower of Power,  Montrose and the Doobie Brothers. Critically acclaimed, they were considered to have blown every other band off the stage, and were eagerly awaited when they returned to Europe in 1976.",
