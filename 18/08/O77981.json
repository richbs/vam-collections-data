On this pot, only the crabstock knop (a decorative swelling) and the applied bunch of grapes hark back to a period when potters were inspired by East Asian porcelain.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe use of contrasting stained and white clays was not new, but seemed to enjoy a revival at this period. For example, salt-glazed stoneware teapots with drab-coloured bodies were also made in the 1760s, perhaps in an effort to compete with the new creamware. On this pot, the highly skilled potting, perfectly formed and proportioned handle and spout, and crisp decoration applied directly to the unfired pot in  brass moulds, together with the apparently careless brushed oxide colour, have produced a successful balance between high quality and low cost.",
