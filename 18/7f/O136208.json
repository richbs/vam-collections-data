His paintings of subjects from medieval legend and Classical mythology and his designs for stained glass, tapestry and many other media played an important part in the Aesthetic Movement and the history of international Symbolism.\n\nThis painting was removed from one of the walls in the Burne-Jones\u2019s country residence, North End House in Rottingdean. This mural decoration was one part of a larger decorative scheme conceived and executed by Burne-Jones for the nursery, which was in an attic room at the top of the house. According to Margaret Mackail (n\u00e9e Burne-Jones, the daughter of Edward Burne-Jones) they were painted in July 1891 for her daughter Angela who had been born in January 1890. Angela Thirkell (Burne-Jones\u2019 granddaughter) became a well known author and included an account of this painting in her book Three Houses which was published in 1931. She describes how on the one sloping wall \u2018my grandfather had painted a picture for my pleasure, a water-mill with its large wheel, reflected in a smooth mill pond\u2019 and on the opposite wall \u2018he had painted a peacock, perched on a tree, with its long tail hanging down.\u2019(1) When Queen Mary was shown this painting in 1932 she recognised it from this description, having read Thirkell\u2019s book.\n\nThirkell describes the paintings as inspiring her childish imagination; for example when writing about the mill she recalls that \u2018there was no story about it, but a child could invent an infinite number of stories for itself.\u2019(2) She records that they were also a source of comfort. As a punishment her nanny would often send her to \u2018the fatal corner,\u2019 a place bereft of any art, and Burne-Jones, on witnessing this lonely penitence, added a painting of \u2018a cat, a kitten playing with its mother\u2019s tail, and a flight of birds\u2019 to the wall in this corner to provide company to his granddaughter.(3) The earlier painting of the peacock with the harmonious palette of greens and blues, the easy positioning of the peacock in the tree and its contented expression give an idea of the happy mood Burne-Jones desired to set in the nursery. \n\n<u>\nBibliographic References\n</u>\n1) Thirkell, Angela, Three Houses, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1931), pp.60 and 61. \n2) Ibid., p.60. \n3) Ibid., p.61.",
