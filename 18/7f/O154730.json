It became a film in 1975, making a star of Tim Curry who created the role of the outrageous bisexual Dr Frank N. Furter, and has been staged on Broadway and in theatres throughout Britain. This costume design for the Oldham Coliseum production was made by Robert Jones, who was then the theatre's trainee designer on an Arts Council bursary. Jones, who had trained at Central School of Art, went on to work at the major British regional theatres, design for West End productions and for the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre, and create sets and costumes for theatres and opera houses in Europe and America. His design for Jeffrey Longmore as Frank N. Furter plays on the idea of The Rocky Horror Show as a film: the design is mounted on a backing of glossy black card and the edges of both paper and card are spray painted to suggest a film strip. The design is an amusing object in its own right, contrasting Dr Frank N. Furter's bulging muscles with the short skirt of the nurse's uniform, and uses a variety of media to indicate the desired effect of the costume, with a plastic mesh placed across the figure's legs becoming his fish-net stockings.",
