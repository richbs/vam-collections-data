The Prince Leopold was sold in 1905 to the Colwyn Bay and Liverpool Steamship Co. and renamed Rhos Neigr. She was sold again to the Mersey Trading Company and was wrecked on 20 July 1908. As the plans show the Prince Leopold was built of iron (represented by blue wash) and had elaborate wooden fittings (represented by brown wash).  The National Martime Museum holds three plans of the same ship (Rig, profile and lines)",
