Philippi was a city in eastern Macedonia and was established by King Philip II. \nThe depicted Heracles (Roman name Hercules) is one of the most important heroes in Greek mythology and represents the characteristics of masculinity, strength, courage and sexual prowess. He was the son of Jupiter and Alcmena, a Theban princess. He is regarded as the embodiment of physical strength and courage.\nHis two main attributes are the club and the lion's skin, which he won at his first labour. He had to undertake 12 labours as a penance for slaying his own children in an act of madness.",
