The spiralled foot bars recall the roped border decoration of contemporary German armour. Their pierced sides made them lighter and more manoeuvrable.\n\nIn medieval warfare, which was dominated by cavalry, stirrups played a vital role. They gave stability to a horse rider and made him more difficult to unseat. They allowed a rider to travel more quickly and safely and to keep tighter control over his horse. This extra stability allowed the rider to fight more aggressively without falling off, using the horse's momentum to deliver wide swinging blows with a sword or battleaxe and charge with a lance.",

This extra stability allowed the rider to fight more aggressively without falling off, using the horse's momentum to deliver wide swinging blows with a sword or battleaxe and charge with a lance.",
