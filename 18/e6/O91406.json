In the 17th century, they were often presented as gifts at family events, such as christenings or marriages. They also appear in contemporary paintings and prints of domestic interiors, gracing the sideboard. Through trade with the north west coast of England, such designs for tankards were copied in the workshops of York and Newcastle.\n\nThis tankard is simply decorated with a wide border of engraved flowers and leaves on the lid. The body is left plain, except for moulded panels applied above each foot, themselves cast in the shape of a ball of flowers and leaves. The motif of embracing figures on these panels are taken from ornament prints by the Italian designer, Steffano della Bella, published in Paris around 1640. Prints were the chief means by which designs circulated between European goldsmiths' workshops.",
