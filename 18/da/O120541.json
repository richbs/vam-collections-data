It was conceived in the tradition of luxurious objets de virtu and was also inspired by ancient sculpture from the Greek Cyclade islands. The small, luxurious wooden object is a rarity in recent times although it has a long tradition in the history of woodworking.  The choice of rich macassar ebony for an evening bag is both unusual and a clear attempt to call attention to the object. Although functional, it is equally a conversation piece intended for adornment.\n\nThe museum also acquired Pantanella's sketchbooks with drawings of Cycladic sculptures, illustrating the process of design. Of his work, Pantanella says 'My interest now is to propose a new type of Italian workman, as in the Renaissance. Because the sons of craftsmen don't wish to pursue similar (common) work, it is up to the privileged class who can work and teach about beauty'.",
