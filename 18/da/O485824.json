The textile has three continuous pattern wefts: green and blue silk, and a gilt paper strip. The panel is rectangular with a long band attached to one edge, sewn to the main part of the textile with green silk and decorated with white silk braid.\n\nThe design of the material consists of formalised waves rendered in blue, green, gold and buff concentric arcs. In the waves are growing clumps of sea-weed (on 1 pattern weft, as required by the design), tan in one repeat of the design and purple in the next. Between each row of seaweed are groups of three jewels or shells. The design thus resembles the lower border of a Chinese dragon robe. The repeat is 10.25 x 5.25 inches (26 x 13.3 cm) wide. The pattern is bound in 2/1 twill.\n\nThe panel is lined with red silk damask which has a pattern of tree peonies. On two corners are paper labels on which are Japanese characters. Two small tabs are attached to two of the corners and a large red silk loop is attached to one side.",
