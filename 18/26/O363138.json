These labels have a printed warp in mid-green, white, black, orange-yellow and a bright blue, together with the bright vermilion, which is the main warp and chief colour of the shawl. These colours are all found in the body of the shawl. The red is woven with black to make a deeper red, and with the yellow to make an orange. \n\nAmong the other decorative fillings, are scattered small blue flowers which lighten the design. \n\nThere is a warp fringe, with about 17 knots at each corner. The selvedge is green. There is a uniform twill binding.",
