The name of the next town \u201cKyung-p\u2019o\u201d can be read on the signal behind the attendant. The Pyongna line is the main Southwest-Northeast rail line running between the capital Pyongyang and Rajin, a town near the Russian border. The round logo of the Chos\u014fn Minjujuui Inmin Konghwaguk Ch\u2019\u014fldos\u014fng (North Korean State Railways) can be found on the trolley next to the attendant.\nThe smiling attendant is wearing a green blouse and a red skirt, with a white cap, apron and shoes. Her uniform is completed by a yellow flower brooch and a pink ribbon. She is checking the time on her wristwatch next to her trolley brimming with food and drinks. Pickled herrings, mandarins, apples and peaches in cans, strawberry juice and water bottles are found on the trolley along with a bag full of mandarins. Crabs and apples, probably all local products from Hongwon, are piled in wooden boxes on the floor together with three liquid containers.\nThe vibrant colours of the attendant and the profusion of local produce contrast against the bare, monochromatic background of the station platform. The painting vehiculates thereby the image of a young, punctual and modern North Korean State Railways in a land where food abounds.\nThe painting is dated to 1989, signed Yi Chong-Ch\u2019\u014fl and sealed.",
