As a young artist he was based in Siena, where his work on a group of choir-books for the cathedral demonstrates his originality as an illuminator; in or soon after 1476 he returned to Verona, where he established himself as one of the city\u2019s major painters. In his Sienese works Liberale adopted the delicate blond figure types of Francesco di Giorgio and Neroccio, often giving them elaborate hairdo's including the almost helmet-like frizzy coiffure sported by the youths in the two panels in the Metropolitan Museum of ca. 1475 and the bathing youths in 5792-1860.  This or wedding chest appropriately depicts the Story of Penelope and Odysseus (Ulysses), the king of Ithaca.  In Homer's Odyssey, Penelope keeps her suitors at bay during Odysseus' twenty year absence by devising a trick, claiming she will only choose one of them upon completion of a burial shroud for Odysseus's father Laertes, she secretly undoes part of the shroud every night. Here Penelope is shown spinning in her house on the left while her husband's ship is finally arriving. Traditionally associated with faithfulness and chastity, Penelope is often evoked in furniture commissioned on the occasion of a wedding or for a woman's bedchamber as a model of feminine virtue.",

London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, p. 265, cat. no. 328.\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\nSienese School, c. 1475 \n328 \nCASSONE PANEL: THE RETURN OF ULYSSES \nTempera on poplar \nwhole panel: 22 X 70 (56 X 177.8) \nPainted surface 15 \u00bc  X 45 (38.7 X 114.3) \n5792-1860 \n\nPenelope is shown spinning in her house on the left while Ulysses' ship is arriving. A comparable scene occurs on a cassone attributed to Matteo di Giovanni (Schubring, 1915, no. 470, pl. cix). \n\nFormerly called Florentine, it was, strangely enough, paired by Schubring with a totally different and much earlier panel (5791-1860; no. 120). Both the style of the painting, in particular the figure of Penelope, and the architectural structure of the panel, with its gilt stucco columns and figures, indicate a Sienese origin. The style of the painting would suggest a date in the first half of the 15th century, but, as the stucco figures are comparable with those, for example, on cassoni of the Francesco di Giorgio workshop (W.68-1925; no. 127) produced in about 1470-75, the painting must also be placed in this period. Such archaism of style is a common feature of cassone paintings in Florence as well as in Siena (see entry on Apollonio di Giovanni). \n\nCondition. The panel has been damaged by worm and the painted surface much rubbed. \nProv. Bought by the Museum in 1860. \nLit. J. H. Pollen, <i>Ancient and modern furniture</i>, 1874, p. 127; P.

            "historical_context_note": "<i>'Cassone'</i> is the Italian term generally used for large, lavishly decorated chests such as this made in Italy from the 14th through the 16th centuries. Wealthy households needed many chests, but the ornate <i>cassoni,</i> (pl.) painted and often combined with pastiglia decoration, were usually commissioned in pairs when a house was renovated for a newly married couple and were ordered, together with other furnishings, by the groom. Florence was the main centre of production, though cassoni were also produced in Siena and occasionally in the Veneto and elsewhere. <i>Cassoni</i> were generally decorated with colorful paintings on three sides and, sometimes, the underside of the lid. The bride used the chests to store her trousseau; items of linen, underclothes, purses, combs, belts, towels, and devotional books. Until about 1460, it was customary, particularly in Florence, to parade these chests through public streets, after this time however, strict sumptuary laws encouraged families to restrict their wedding celebrations to palace courtyards or loggias. The depiction of triumphal processions in the later half of the fifteenth century may be imaginative re-creations of abandoned practices and traditions. By the 19th century, many wedding chests had been dismantled and sold to tourists, especially British and Americans who developped a particular fondness for Florence.\n\nThe Pastiglia decoration on the sides\nPastiglia\n\nItalian term used to describe a form of decoration applied to furniture such as cassone and, in particular, small caskets. Pastiglia decoration was made from white powder formed when ground lead was exposed to vinegar vapour in a sealed jar. It was then mixed with egg white to make a malleable paste; and lead matrices (moulds) were used to stamp out relief figures or decorative motifs, which were applied with rabbit-skin glue to the gilding.",
