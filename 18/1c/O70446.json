Benito in Valladolid in Spain, where it was placed on the banco, the lower part. The remainder of the altarpiece, which was dismantled in the 19th century, is in the National Museum of Sculpture in Valladolid. Alonso Berruguete was one of the most important sculptors active in Castile in the first half of the sixteenth century. He spent time in Italy before returning to his native Spain, and the influence of Italian renaissance sculpture is evident in this figure.",

The figure probably stood originally in the niche immediately to the right of the tabernacle in the bottom register of the altarpiece.\n\nHistorical significance: The son of the painter Pedro Berruguete (d. 1494), who worked at the court of Urbino, Alonso Berruguete was one of the foremost Spanish artists of the sixteenth century. Berruguete  spent some years in Italy (mainly Rome and Florence), from about 1506 onwards, and returned to Spain by 1517.
