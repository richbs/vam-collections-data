His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nMessel\u2019s first work on Broadway was Peter Glenville\u2019s production of Shakespeare\u2019s Romeo and Juliet at the Broadhurst Theatre, New York, 1951.   His costumes and sets were inspired by Italian Renaissance painting and were faithful to the conventions of an Elizabethan stage.   The New York critics found the designs colourful and atmospheric, but the direction received  mixed reviews.   The production ran for forty-nine performances.\n\nThe film actress Olivia de Havilland (1916-) made her debut on Broadway in the role of Juliet.  The New York critics found her charming to look at but thought that her verse-speaking was not sensitive enough for a Shakespearean drama.",

It was directed by Peter Glenville and featured Olivia de Havilland as Juliet and Douglas Watson as Romeo.  \nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's theatre designs and other designs and artefacts.  The designs were briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being housed at the V&A from 1981 on indefinite loan.  The V&A Theatre Museum purchased the Oliver Messel collection from Lord Snowdon in 2005.\n\nHistorical significance: This was Messel's first work to be initiated on Broadway.",
