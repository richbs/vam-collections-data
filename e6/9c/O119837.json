            "physical_description": "The chair back is convex at the front and concave at the back.  The front of the back is veneered with ten segments of mahogany.  These have cracked with the effect of creating a mini decagon shape in the centre of the back.  Around the outside of the front face of the chair back is a flower-and-ribbon moulding that is more characteristic of the late eighteenth century than 1740, which is the date the chair purports to be.  There is a metal eye fixed into the back of the chair back, roughly level with the scrolls at the bottom of the medallion on the front.  Behind the chair back is a concave moulded block that helps to cantilever the back.  This is perhaps not original.\n  \nThe lion-head arm-ends are very worn \u2013 is this from handling or could it be fakery?  The carving of the shells at the bottom of the arm supports seems more accomplished than the carving of the vetruvian scroll around the seat.  At the back, both armrests have been repaired and are held to the chair back with metal straps - it is not immediately clear how these were secured originally.  The arm supports have a very shallow rebate on the inside face which sits on the seat but are otherwise fixed by two plugged screws from the outside.  They are presumably tenoned up into the armrests.  The right arm support seems to have been heavily damaged at one time and subsequently repaired.\n\nThe flat chair seat is just over one and a quarter inches thick but underneath has only been planed at the sides leaving a large section in the middle, tapering toward the back, which is very roughly chiselled and consequently thicker (approx. one and a half inches thick).  There are three screw holes visible in the chiselled area, which could mean the wood had a previous use.  The flat top is glued down to the sides, which have vetruvian mouldings that are chamfered underneath.  Metal straps are screwed into the inside of the front right leg and right side and left side.  A metal strap is also screwed to the underside of the seat at the back in the middle \u2013 it is not clear what the one under the seat is doing.\n\nThe front legs are most likely tenoned up into the sides but the blocks behind the ears and legs conceal all evidence for this.  The side seat-rails appear to be tenoned into the back legs.  The back seat-rail of beech with a mahogany facing is also tenoned into the back legs.  In front of the back seat-rail are two blocks of [?]softwood.  The smaller of these blocks is flush with the front of the back legs, while the larger block, which lies in front of the smaller block and the back legs and is screwed up to the seat and back into the legs and/or the smaller block, lies more or less level with the side ears to the back legs.  Two new blocks between them conceal where the chair back is tenoned down through the seat.",
