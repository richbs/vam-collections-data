It is one of a number of illustrated letters which Beatrix Potter (1866-1943) wrote to children which she eventually converted into one of her 'little books'. The island that the squirrels sail out to on their self-constructed rafts, is known as \u2018Owl Island\u2019 in Beatrix\u2019s letter to Norah, one of the children of her former governess, and also within the following book. The island can actually be identified as St Herberts Island in the middle of Derwentwater. \n\nBetween 1885 and 1903 Potter spent six of her long family summer breaks, first at Lingholm and then Fawe Park, both country estates near Derwentwater. Beatrix\u2019s picture letters are often highly influenced by the places in which they were written. Red squirrels are known to find their homes in the woods near Lingholm and it was here the idea for 'Nutkin' was sown.\n\nBeatrix Potter (1866-1943) is one of the world's best-loved children's authors and illustrators. She wrote the majority of the twenty-three original Peter Rabbit books between 1901 and 1913. The Tale of Peter Rabbit (Frederick Warne, 1902) is her most famous and best-loved tale.",
