            "public_access_description": "The parasol was a popular accessory during the 19th and early 20th century, a period when sun tanned skin was highly undesirable. It functioned both as a sunshade and a fashionable accompaniment to dress, distinguishing itself from the umbrella through its infinite and luxurious forms and essentially feminine status. Like the earlier trend for fans parasols displayed an individual's style and could be used in a coquettish ritual to hide the modest bearer from unwanted glances\n\nSmall parasols such as this example were designed for open carriage rides which were hugely popular in the middle of the nineteenth century. A folding hinge, held upright by a sliding metal tube when open, meant the parasol could be reduced to half its size when not in use. Carriage parasols were often elaborate in design as their small size meant manufacturers could display their very best in labour and materials. They were also key in the display of wealth and taste, the very possession of one implying ownership of a carriage. In this example the typically thin ivory stick with intricate carving appears too delicate to support the heavy double fringing of the cover. Fringing reached the height of its popularity in the mid 19th century. The Ladies Gazette of Fashion in July 1847 reported on parasols such as this with two rows of fringing, '[the] first row is that of the colour of the parasol, the second that of the lining, the effect is equally pretty and pleasing.' The peach fringing in this example reflects the peach silk lining which would have been displayed when the shade was held over the shoulder.",
