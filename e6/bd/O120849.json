The left hand figure (St Matthew) holds a double-lined, gilded scroll in his right hand, reading downwards: 'ECCE VIRGO CONCIPIET ET PARI', and a green and yellow halo.  His robe is green and yellow enamel, with a blue and white cloak.  The right hand figure (Isaiah) holds a vertical scroll in both hands, reading: 'HIC ES ENIM DEUS NOSTER', and his halo is green and yellow, and blue and white.  His robe is white and yellow enamel, with a green and yellow cloak.  The faces, feet and hands of both figures are reserved in the copper-gilt.\n\nThe upper part of the background has vermiculated decoration, while the lower part has a diagonal hatching engraved pattern.  Around the edge of the central panel is an enamelled border onto which the feet of the figures protrude: the upper and lower sides are reddish brown, while the left and right sides are green and yellow.\n\n<font -u>Frame:</font -u> \nThe border frame on either side has engraved foliage decoration.  The top edge has a stylised, upside-down dragon, with its head to the left, while the bottom edge has a similar beast (the right way up) with its head to the right.  The background of the frame has been engraved with a cross-hatching pattern.  There are eight holes around the edge, presumably originally intended for pinning the plaque against a wooden core.\n\n<font -u>Reverse:</font -u> \nThe reverse is plain copper, with hammering marks visible.  There is a V scratched towards the upper left, and the painted figures 4845.",

St Matthew's text - 'Behold a Virgin shall conceive and bear [a son]' - is in itself a quote from Isaiah, and this would be have been a deliberate link between the two.\n\nThe original function of this plaque is not known, but it must have been part of a larger set decorating perhaps an altarpiece or shrine. Another very similar plaque showing Sts Simeon and Peter, survives in the Louvre in Paris.  Like the V&A plaque, the Paris plaque shows two full-length figures with inscriptions, set within an angled frame with dragons and foliage - it is also of similar dimensions.",
