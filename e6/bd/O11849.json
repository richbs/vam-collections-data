Large areas of verditer were discovered behind pier glasses in 1999 when the room was being treated for dry rot. The current wallcovering is a 19th century silk, applied over the verditer paper. The former is to be re-instated.\n\nBlue and green verditer (also known as Bremen blue and Bremen green) are pigments derived from copper carbonate which were developed in the 18th century and were widely used in the late 18th, and 19th centuries for wallpapers. Both are impermanent and toxic.",
