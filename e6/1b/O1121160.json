Although by this date attendance was mandatory for those up to age 13, children often opted to go to work or stay at home instead. These heavy, prestigious prizes recognised the commitment of those who were on time for registration every single day.\n\nAlthough up to four half-days per year could be missed for religious events like funerals, the school had to be notified two days in advance. Concerns were raised at various times about pupils coming to school with scarlet fever as they were so desperate to achieve full attendance.\n\nHenry Howett managed seven consecutive years of full attendance, spanning the reign of two monarchs. He proceeded through the ranks of white metal medals, to bronze and finally gilded bronze medals as his achievements mounted.",
