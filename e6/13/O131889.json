Studied at Sass's Academy from 1835; entered RA Schools. In a long, prolific, and highly successful career, exhibited 107 works at the RA between 1840 and 1906, 13 at the BI 1838-1857, and 12 at the Society of British Artists 1838-1883. Subjects predominantly literary, historical, and - most notably - scenes of contemporary life, with which he achieved his greatest popular fame, amplified by many engraved reproductions, beginning with <i>Ramsgate Sands</i> (exh RA 1854 and bought by Queen Victoria). In 1875 his <i>Dinner at Boswell's</i> ... of 1869 sold at Christie's for \u00a34567, the highest price ever achieved by a living artist. Member of 'The Clique' in the 1840s; elected ARA 1845, RA 1852. Died Sr John's Wood, London, 2 November 1909; there had been a studio sale at Christie's 14 June 1884. The <i>Art Journal</i> obituarist wrote: 'the artist will be missed: he was an institution'. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1856, pp237-40 (for other references to Frith in the <i>Art Union</i> and <i>Art Journal</i>, see the entry in C Wood <i>Dictionary of Victorian Painters</i> 1971); W P Frith <i>My Autobiography and Reminiscences</i> 3 vols 1887-8; <i>Times</i> 4 November 1909 (obit); <i>Art Journal</i>191O, p14 (obit); Mrs J Panton <i>Leaves from a Life</i> 1909, <i>More Leaves from a Life</i> 1911; W P <i>Frith</i> Whitechapel Art Gallery exhibition catalogue 1951; N Wallis <i>A Victorian Canvas</i> 1957; J Mass <i>Gambart: Prince of the Victorian art world</i> 1975; A Noakes <i>William Frith: Extraordinary Victorian Painter</i> 1978. \n\n<b>Mr Honeywood Introduces the Bailiffs to Miss Richland as his Friends</b> \nFAH Neg 31848 \nCanvas, 71.1 x 104.2 cm (28 x 41 ins) \nSigned and dated 'W P Frith 1850' \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nCommissioned by John Sheepshanks in 1850, and, according to the artist, the last picture he was to commission; Frith quotes Sheepshanks as saying: 'Never sold a picture, and I never will; and if what I hear of the prices that you gentlemen are getting now is true, I can't pay them, so my picture-buying days are over'. The painting was exhibited at the RA in 1850, with the following lines quoted in the catalogue: \n\n<i>Honeywood</i>: Two of my very good friends, Mr Twitch and Mr Flanigan. Pray, gentlemen, sit without ceremony. \n\n<i>Miss Richland</i>: Who can these odd-looking men be? I fear it is as I was informed. It must be so (aside). \n\nThe subject is from Oliver Goldsmith's play <i>The Good-natur'd Man</i>, first produced in 1768. In act 3 scene 1, Honeywood, the 'good-natur'd man', has been taught a lesson in the foolishness of generosity by his uncle, who has him arrested for debt. When the bailiffs arrive to take possession, Honeywood bribes them to pretend to be his friends in front of his beloved Miss Richland, who nevertheless guesses their identity. As G S Rousseau (<i>Goldsmith: the Critical Heritage</i>1974, p7) comments, the author's reputation reached its zenith in the 1820s - that is, in Frith's childhood - and then slowly declined; however, the simple pathos, humour, and wealth of incident (particularly in 'The Vicar of Wakefield',) ensured his continuing appeal to painters. \n\nThe <i>Art Journal</i> critic in 1850 thought 'the point of the work is the contrast between Honeywood and his friends, who are the veriest off-scourings of the lowest spunging-house in Chancery Lane ... The drawing and colouring are both masterly'. \n\nIn the 1857 review of the Sheepshanks Gift, the <i>Art Journal</i> found that 'the bailiffs are slightly caricatured, and have, perhaps, too much of that of which Honeywood has too little - that is, spirit'. The <i>Athenaeum</i> critic noted 'a spirit in the touch that contributes to the look of vivacity where this quality is essential'. The popularity of the work with patrons is confirmed by the existence of perhaps as many as six other versions of the subject (see <i>Versions</i> below). \n\nJohn Woodward has pointed out that the figure of Miss Richland is very similar in pose and costume to Sir Joshua Reynolds' portrait of Miss Keppel (about 1782, engraved 1820, now Ashmolean Museum, Oxford). The clock on the mantelpiece (which also appears in William Holman Hunt's 'The Awakening Conscience', 1853, now Tate Gallery) belonged to Augustus Egg, a friend of Frith.\n \nThe 'original sketch for the picture at the South Kensington Museum' was sold at Christie's 22 June 1865 (150, bought Grundy \u00a3147), presumably the sale listed in Redford <i>Sales</i> as the property of Hinde, the lot as bought in at \u00a3147. \n\nEXH: RA 1850 (534); <i>Exposition Universelle</i> Paris 1855 (799, lent by Sheepshanks); <i>Victorian Narrative Painting</i> V&A circulating exhibition 1961 \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1850, p176; <i>Athenaeum</i> 25 May 1850, p559; G Waagen <i>Treasures of Art in Great Britain</i> II, p302; <i>Art Journal</i> 1856, p240, 1857, p240; <i>London Society</i> XI, 1867, pp247-52; <i>Autobiography</i> I, pp205-6 \n\n<i>Versions</i>: 1 Sold Christie's (W F Bolckow sale) 5 May 1888 (42, 71.1 x 104.1 cm (28 x 41 ins), as exhibited RA 1850), bought Vokins \u00a3462; Christie's (Lady Lampson sale) 8 June 1901 (19,69 x 101.6 cm (27 x  40 ins), as ex-Bolckow collection, dated 1866), bought Lister \u00a3194 5s \n\n2 Redford <i>Sales</i> lists a 1864 sale, property of Fitzpatrick, bought in \u00a3472 \n\n3 Sold Christie's 1 April 1881 (256), bought Agnew \u00a3420; private collection; bought University of Kentucky Art Museum (as 'School for Scandal') 1984 [28 x 40.6 cm (11 x 16 ins)] \n\n4 Sold Christie's (S G Holland sale) 25 June 1908 (34, 44.4 x 66 cm (17\u00bd x 26 ins), signed and dated 1886), bought Gooden \u00a3168; sold Sotheby's Belgravia 10 July 1973 (58, 44.5 x 65 cm (17\u00bd x 25\u00bd ins), signed and dated 1886, repr) \n\n5 Small version, signed and dated, recorded in private collection 1933; possibly identical with version 4 or 6 \n\n6 Exhibited <i>W P Frith</i> RA Whitechapel Art Gallery 1951 (16, panel, 28 x 40.6 cm (11 x 16 ins), signed and dated 1850), lent by Sir Ernest Makins\"",
