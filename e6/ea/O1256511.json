The nose is purple and the eyebrows a deeper purple. The paw pads, inner ears and muzzle use a shorter and smoother material. The mouth is open and has a lighter pink tongue. The eyes are brown and black plastic with a white surround that gives them a staring effect. There is stitching on the paw pads to indicate fingers and toes. The bear has a small tail and there is an opening in its back with a battery and voicebox inside.\n[box] Rectangular box coloured predominantly pink with a large heart shaped cellophane window at the front and a smaller double heart shaped one on top. There are hears and stars all over the box and two illustrations of the bear, one on each side. The back has a photographic image of the bear with instructions on how to use it. There is a quantity of writing on the back and front of the box. There are two perforations on the front to enable the interactivity to be accessed. One is a heart shape in the cellophane and one a circle within a blue heart at the proper left hand corner.\nInside the box is a removable lining that goes around three sides leaving the front open. This is blue with white spotlight effects and has a flat moulded piece of clear cellophane attached to the back.",

He is a plush, pink teddy bear with a big plum nose, a sweet strawberry scent and a southern accent. As the leader of the toys at the Sunnyside Daycare Center, he initially acts like a kind-hearted and wise caretaker, but is later revealed to be more of a ruthless warden, although his backstory makes him more of a tragic villain.\nUnlike a lot of Toy Story characters who are based on real old toys such as Mr Potato Head, Lotso was invented just for this film. For advertising purposes some fake 1980s television advertisements were made by Pixar, the company behind the film, in order to try and convince people that Lotso was an old bear.",
