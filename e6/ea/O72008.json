When executed for the court, the finest hat badges became superb small-scale works of art.  They displayed both the taste and interests of the wearer and the virtuosity of the goldsmith.  This badge was probably made in an English workshop, because a number of other jewels resembling it in type have inscriptions in English.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe badge shows an ancient Roman warrior, possibly an emperor, wearing armour and a lionskin, one of the attributes of the legendary hero Hercules who slew the Nemean lion.  The head  gazes out from a roundel, similar to those found on Roman triumphal arches.  The subject shows the appeal of ancient Rome and Greece to the Renaissance mind.\n\nHistory of Collecting\nThis jewel was purchased by the Museum for \u015368 from the collection of Alessandro Castellani (1823-1883), the famous Italian jeweller and dealer in antiquities. His collection was sold in Rome in 1884.  At the time the object was thought to be 'Ancient Roman', and was attached by chains to two small female heads and a winged putto (cherub).",
