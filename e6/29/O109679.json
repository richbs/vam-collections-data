            "physical_description": "This vase was made in Yaozhou, north of the divide separating northern and southern China (see p.24). It has a grey stoneware body, covered with an olive-green glaze. Modern scholars in the West traditionally refer to this type as celadon, the Chinese equivalent for this term being simply 'greenware'.\n\nThe first greenwares were made in southern China. Eventually the technology spread to the north and for a brief period in the eleventh century the Yaozhou products outshone their southern competitors, due partly to the fact that the capital city, Kaifeng, was situated much closer to the northern kilns. The geographical proximity of the Yaozhou and Ding kilns (see p.36) led to these two wares sharing many stylistic features. The decoration on Yaozhou ware, however, tends to be deeply carved, rather than incised or moulded. The olive-green glaze pools in the carved areas, intensifying in colour and making the design - in this case a peony - much more apparent. \n\nThe Yaozhou kiln site was excavated by the Chinese authorities in the twentieth century, but there is currently no evidence that the wares were exported in the Song dynasty. China's neighbour Korea produced a similar green-glazed stoneware in the twelfth century, but Yaozhou ware is not thought to have been its source of inspiration.",

While the wares produced at the Yaozhou kiln complex enjoyed popularity from the end of the Tang dynasty (618-906) through to the beginning of the Yuan dynasty (1279-1368), this bottle exhibits the olive green glaze and carved floral designs common to the Yaozhou wares of the Northern Song period. \n\nThe beautifully complex design of this bottle began with a smooth body, partially dried (or \u2018leather hard\u2019). Using an angled tool, the floral pattern was carved out of the surface in sloping grooves. The celadon glaze was then applied to this uneven surface, pooling in the crevices and laying thinly on raised areas. Through firing, the pooled areas grew darker in colour, and the thinly glazed areas more transparent, creating illusion of light and shadows on the surface of this bottle.",
