The style of the costume worn by Gaby Deslys on the poster reflects some of the elegant costumes designed for the production by the French Art Nouveau painter and theatre designer Georges de Feure (1868-1943).\n\nBy 1915 the French actress, singer and dancer Gaby Deslys (1881-1920) was already a star on Broadway where the dance The Gaby Glide was created in her honour. She made her London debut in 1906 as The Charm of Paris in the musical comedy The New Aladdinat the Gaiety Theatre, and had appeared at the Alhambra in March 1910 as Suzette in Les Caprices de Suzette. Andre Charlot wanted to include her in his 1915 revue, named after the box office telephone number of the Alhambra Theatre, but from 29 March 1915 she appeared at the Duke of York's Theatre and then on tour in J.M. Barrie's revue Rosy Rapture, the Pride of the Beauty Chorus. When 5064 Gerrard opened in March 1915 audiences had to be content with an impersonation of her by the comedian Robert Hale, dancing with Jack Morrison as J.M. Barrie in a kilt, but to Charlot's delight Deslys joined the cast in June.",
