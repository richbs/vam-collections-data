            "public_access_description": "The designs of domestic embroideries like this one are clearly based on the more expensive woven silks popular at the Ottoman court. The embroideries have the same flowers, serrated leaves and other motifs as the woven silks, but their shapes are often less well-defined. \n\nThe embroideries required less costly materials (mainly linen and silk thread) and women could make them in their own homes. Large panels served as quilt-covers and hangings. Smaller pieces were used as napkins, sashes and towels, and for wrapping one\u2019s possessions on the way to the public bath. \n\nMost of the embroidery is done in simple stitches, such as darning stitch, couching and running stitch.",
