            "physical_description": "Silk satin embroidered with couched metal thread and couched silk and metal threads.  The silk threads have been plied with metal thread to create a 2-ply Z-twisted thread; the colours are thus muted in shade.\nRed satin ground with a central rosette surrounded by a narrow 8-pointed border with a small star-like flowers between the points and 2 types of blossoms: a stylised elongated one alternating with a more elaborate form with a silver thread infill couched to form small feathers. Beyond this is a complex line of split leaves, trefoils and palmettes.  On each diagonal ie. Pointing into each corner, is a larger version of the feather-filled blossom already described, from which emerge two snaking stems with blossoms and leaves - these extend to bracket the corner motifs [see below].  At the cardinal points the split leaf border forms a compartment with a trefoil at its base, a pointed flower at the top and containing an iris flower.  The corner motif consists of two rosettes, a tulip like flower and a pointed leaf with a carnation and leaves curving from the tulip.\nTwo lines of black silk and metal thread edge the central panel and the wide border.  The border design has an inward facing pointed composite blossom has an inward facing pointed composite blossom in each corner linked by a curving meander with star-like flower, a rosette and smaller carnations.\nEmbroidery threads: light blue, pink, purple, green, dark blue.\nMetal threads: silver strip close S-wound on Z-twist silk and silver-gilt strip close S-wound on Z-twist silk.\nFacing: bias cut wove silk; stripes.  Satin ground.\n[1] wide dark blue ground with densely packed small indistinct floral pattern in light blue outlined in red\n[2] wider faded red ground with an oval shaped floral arrangement in indistinct colours.  There is an individual floral sprig off-set and to either side\n[3] separating [1] and [2]: narrow yellow ground with 2 types of isolated curving floral sprig separated by a small upright tulip like sprig.\nBacking: woven silk, possibly brocaded, probably Russian.  Light brown satin ground with weft pattern in yellow silk.  There are traces of silver metal trip around this weft. Narrow undulating stems with blossoms including carnations and bunches of grapes.  Two pieces joined together.",
