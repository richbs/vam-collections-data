The interior and exterior are covered in a thick red glaze which shows black where it breaks at the shoulder and mouth-rim. Over this are scattered the dancing L-shaped motifs from which the work derives its title. These were applied by means of a resist technique and vary in colour from greenish-grey to bluish-black.\n[Storage box] Wooden box, comprising box and lid, inscribed on the outside: 'Kokutetsu Henko / Gunbu (black iron [glazed] flattened jar / 'Dancing Crowd'), and on the inside 'Dai Junanaki Nitten Schuchin (?) saku / Hiroaki' + seal (Exhibited at the 17th Nitten exhibition / (made by) Hiroaki) and Hiroaki T.

While Morino's vessels are imbued with an elegance and sophistication that one might associate with traditional Kyoto culture, his interest in abstraction and the vocabulary of symbols he uses are the products of his exposure to modern western art.\nThis work was shown at the 1985 Nitten exhibition, an event to which Morino has contributed since 1957. He taught ceramics at the University of Chicago in 1962-63 and 1966-68, and has been a regular participant in exhibitions in Europe, the U.S.A. and other overseas venues.",
