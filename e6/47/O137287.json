The company's main focus has been on the craftsmanship of a high-quality product and all processes, from the design to cutting and sewing of leather components to packaging and shipping, take place within the company.  Moreschi's expert shoemakers create each individual pair of shoes through a complex series of stages involving work by hand and the use of modern machinery, marrying old world shoemaking with modern technology. \n\nThese shoes were worn with a two-piece lightweight brown wool suit with a fine white woven fleck, designed by John Michael.
