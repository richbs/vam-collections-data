It depicts a laurel wreath with inscription.\nJohn Edward Gray (1800-1875) studied medicine. He had first interests in botany, later zoology. He worked at the British Museum in the zoology department from 1824 till 1874 and become keeper of the department there in 1840. His wife Maria Emma (1787-1876) was a conchologist and algologist and assisted her husband in his studies. \n\nGeorge Gammon Adams (b. 1821-1898) was a portrait sculptor and medallist. He designed and exhibited prize medals for the Great Exhibition. In 1852 he was chosen to model the death mask of Wellington. One of his public monuments is the 'Napier' statue in Trafalgar square.\n\nThe roundel was among the items given to the Museum by I. D. Adams, the daughter of  George Gammon Adams, in 1980. In total, 196 items were included in the Adams gift, which consisted of many models for medals as well as the busts and figurative sculpture. In most instances it is not possible to date conclusively the many models included in this gift.",
