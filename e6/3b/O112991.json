The group's appearance was radically altered in 1960, when it was cleaned and it was discovered that the right hand and wrist of the Virgin, the left arm of the Christ-Child and two finials on the front of the Virgin's crown were restorations. Extensive traces of pigmentation still survive, although this is not original in most places: on the Virgin's mantle and gown there are remains of blue paint, the swaddling cloth of the Child is red and the faces retain flesh tones, with red on the lips. The figure is carved in the round. \nFollowing the lines of both arms to their logical conclusion , it seems likely that they would have com extremely close and were probably touching. This intimate relationship of Mother and Child is shown in a number of other Virgin and Child groups from Lorraine.",

This figure is closely related to the earliest group of Lorraine Virgins such as the one in the cloister of the cathedral in Saint Di\u00e9, another Virgin in Saint Di\u00e9, the Virgin and Child from Ch\u00e2tenois now preserved in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and another in the Parish church of Le Grand Thon. All of these figures are either still preserved in Vosges area of Lorraine or come from there.The iconographic type of the Maria lactans, the Virgin suckling the Child, emphasizes the intimate relation of the Virgin and the Child.",
