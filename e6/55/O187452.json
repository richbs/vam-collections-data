He was a poet, humanist and epigrammist, based in Naples. He is most famous for his masterwork 'Arcadia', which he wrote in 1480 (not published before 1503) and which first institutes the theme of Arcadia in European literature. Arcadia refers to a utopian vision of a pastoral life and its harmony with nature, its idyllic vision of unspoiled wilderness.\nIt was the first pastoral romance in Renaissance Europe to gain international success.",
