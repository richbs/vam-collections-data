The base is made of thick card and the building stands flush with two of the base edges, but inset. The remaining perimeter consists of wooden fencing painted white which has one gateway. The outside base area is covered with green felt upon which sawdust has been sprinkled. Between the gateway and the door is a rectangular paved path made by sticking irregular shapes of paper onto the card base. Within the fencing stands a notice board of wood, card and paper.\nThe inside of the building is hollow with a floor of plywood. The outside is painted cream with brown edging pieces. The door and window frames and sills are all painted white. There is a doorstep, a lantern with blue cellophane and a large sign saying Police with an illustration of handcuffs, all at the front of the building. There are five windows, three are latticed, two on the ground floor, one on the first. The other two are multi-paned, the ground floor one has shutters and the first floor is a gabled window. The roof is sharply pitched and has a red tile effect made by a regular pattern of small rectangles of paper. There is a chimney made of card painted cream with extra rectangles of card stuck on to give a brick effect.",
