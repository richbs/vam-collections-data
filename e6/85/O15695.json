            "public_access_description": "Zandra Rhodes is first and foremost a textile artist whose clothes are designed to showcase her fabrics. Her designs are unconventional, creative, and always beautifully detailed. The detail shows a plain seam on a blue chiffon evening dress. Rhodes has deliberately reversed the seam, and hand-rolled the exposed chiffon edges. Gold beads make the exposed seam even more of a design feature, and help the fabric hang gracefully.\n\nThe textile print is very simple and free. Swirling lines, sweeping curves, and dashed crosses enhance the flowing nature of the silk chiffon. The stylised woman's face, boldly drawn with a few simple lines, has become a Rhodes signature.\n\nIn 1979, this dress was part of a group of twenty-five fully accessorised ensembles donated to the Museum to represent the fashions for Winter 1979. It was worn with a pleated satin short cape, also by Rhodes, a brooch by Andrew Logan worn as a hair ornament and a pair of strappy gold high-heeled shoes by La Garonda.",
