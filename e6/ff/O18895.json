            "physical_description": "Chinese Imperial throne of carved polychrome lacquer on wood core.\nAdditional note: The 'Nan-Haidze' of the Spink's advertisement is to be identified with the 'nan yuan' (southern park), an area of 210 km\u00b2, situated 10km outside the 'Yongding' Gate, 10 km south of Beijing. The colloquial name 'nan hai zi' (southern lakes) is attested by 'chen yuan zhi lue' of 1788 (p.216), where it may refer to the whole complex, or simply to its southern part around the 'Nan hong men' (Southern Red Gate). The park is referred to as 'Nan yuan hai zi' on the 1907 German Staff map of Beijing, issued by the War Office, 1908 (V&A FED Library Box 2.2A).\nThe park was used in the Qing period principally for troop reviews, but also for some hunting. It contained four major travelling palaces ('xing gong'), in 1777. The site was occupied and seriously damaged by foreign troops during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900.\nThere is no firm evidence as to which of the Nan Yuan 'travelling palaces' the throne and its attendant screen were taken from. It can be assumed that some form of 'throne' was present in the main halls of all four. If it was taken from the Tuan He Travelling Palace, as being the most desirable object of looting, then that would suggest a date of 1775-1780, which is acceptable stylistically. \nThe companion screen is 71.233 in the Museum Fur Volkerkunde, Vienna. The main subject there is the Pan Tao Feast, birthday of Xi Wang Mu, which runs across all three leaves. The screen was in the Austrian embassy, Beijing by October 1900, and relatively full documentation survives concerning its acquisition by the Museum. \nSources: Wu Changyuan, ''Chen Yuan Zhi lue'' (1788), Beijing, Guji chubanshe ed.

ISBN 1851773088.\nArtefacts from the Chinese imperial court, including this grand and ornate throne (and cats. 106-107), enthralled many \nnineteenth-century collectors and consequently figure prominently in the Museum\u2019s collection. The throne was almost certainly commissioned in the late 1780s for the Tuanhe Travelling Palace, one of several temporary abodes of the emperors of the Qing dynasty in the Nan Haizi (\u201csouthern ponds\u201d) hunting park immediately south of Beijing. This park formed the setting for a number of military reviews celebrating the apogee of Man-chu power in Asia, but was neglected in the nineteenth century and gradually fell into decay. The Nan Haizi park was looted by Russian troops in 1900-01, in the aftermath of the occupation of Beijing by troops of the eight allied powers (including the United States and Great Britain) that invaded China, ostensibly to suppress the so-called Boxer Uprising. The czarist Russian ambassador Mikhail N. Girs acquired the throne in China and brought it to Britain following the Soviet revolution of 1917.\n\tThe throne was displayed by the dealer Spink & Son at its St. James\u2019s premises and bought from the firm on behalf of the Museum by George Swift, a major figure in the wholesale potato industry in Britain and, during World War I, a colleague of Edward Fairbrother Strange, the V&A\u2019s furniture curator.\n\tNeither Spink nor the Museum has ever attempted to conceal the origins of the throne, which is valued as much for its imperial associations as for its craftsmanship. It has been on continuous display since its acquisition, labelled until the 1980s as \u201cThrone of Emperor Ch\u2019ien-lung\u201d (Qianlong). Until 1952 the throne had pride of place in the displays of Oriental furniture and woodwork (see fig. 105), and since then has been prominent in the Far Eastern Primary Gallery and the T. T. Tsui Gallery of Chinese Art.\n\tIn his 1925 Catalogue of Chinese Lacquer, Strange made the first serious attempt in a European language to provide an overview of lacquer, concentrating on itemising the medium\u2019s most common decorative motifs and their symbolic significance, a style of scholarship derived from the study of Chinese ceramics. More recently, attention has shifted away from the throne\u2019s glamourous lacquer medium and towards the object\u2019s provenance, with an attempt to provide a more precise date and place of manufacture and to understand its role as symbolic of British hegemony in Asia in the popular and institutional imagination.\n\nLit.

This park formed the setting for a number of military reviews celebrating the apogee of Man-chu power in Asia, but was neglected in the nineteenth century and gradually fell into decay. The Nan Haizi park was looted by Russian troops in 1900-01, in the aftermath of the occupation of Beijing by troops of the eight allied powers (including the United States and Great Britain) that invaded China, ostensibly to suppress the so-called Boxer Uprising. The czarist Russian ambassador Mikhail N. Girs acquired the throne in China and brought it to Britain following the Soviet revolution of 1917.\n\tThe throne was displayed by the dealer Spink & Son at its St. James's premises and bought from the firm on behalf of the Museum by George Swift, a major figure in the wholesale potato industry in Britain and, during World War I, a colleague of Edward Fairbrother Strange, the V&A's furniture curator.",
