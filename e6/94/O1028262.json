Following his conversion  to  Catholicism in 1835, he identified the Gothic style with Christian architecture and his work and   writings inspired and framed the Gothic Revival. In 'Contrasts', published in 1836, he condemned   classical forms and ardently praised 14th and 15th-century architecture. Pugin is best   remembered for his work on the Palace of Westminster, in which he was responsible for much of  the interior decoration. The Palace, commonly known as the Houses of Parliament, was  reconstructed in the Gothic style from 1840 following a devastating fire.\n\n\tExotic fruits such as pineapples and pomegranites have a long history as popular artistic motifs,  symbolising opulence, power and hospitality.",
