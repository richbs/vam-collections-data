These meanders lie on top of a floral meander bearing botehs.  These stripes are separated by sets of narrow stripes.\nBorders from the inside:\n(1) white ground with a dark blue meander bearing red and orange flowers\n(2) narrow stripe with white ground with a green meander with red and orange flowers\n(3) Main Border: orange ground with a dark yellow meander outlined in dark blue with predominantly red naturalistic flowers with branching stems\n(4)  as (2)\n(5)  as (1)\nCatalogue Date:  9.2.2000",
