            "public_access_description": "This marble bust representing Nicol\u00f2 Paganini - the violin virtuoso (1782-1840) - is made by the sculptor Henry Westmacott, in 1832, in Edinburgh.\nPaganini's only visit to England and Scotland took place in the years 1831-2 and this bust probably commemorates this occasion.\n\nHenry Westmacott (1784-1961) was the son of Richard Westmacott the Elder (1747-1808). The Westmacott was a prominent family of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century English sculptors. Henry is particularly known for the prodigious quantity of chimneypieces he produced.",
