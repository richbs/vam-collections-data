He moved to Paris in about 1851 as overseer for the Dumas stove and tile firm and in 1855 opened his own studio and, later his own retail shop, with his brother Xavier. In 1887, only three years before his death, Deck became Director of the National Manufactory at S\u00e8vres.\n\nAlbert Anker arrived in Paris from Switzerland to further his painting studies in 1858, shortly after Deck began his workshop.  The two were introduced by a mutual acquaintance and the first known commision for Anker was in 1866. Anker specialised in rural and domestic scenes in his own painting and was able to use many of these subjects, painting in a remarkably free and natural manner, on Deck's ceramics.  In some contrast, he also specialised in portraits, particularly of historical characters, painted in an elaborately theatrical style.",

The two were introduced by a mutual acquaintance and the first known commission for Anker was in 1866. Anker specialised in rural and domestic scenes in his own painting and was able to use many of these subjects, painting in a remarkably free and natural manner, on Deck's ceramics. In some contrast, he also specialised in portraits, particularly of historical characters, painted in an elaborately theatrical style.",
