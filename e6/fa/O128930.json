All three crosses feature the crucified Christ in half relief. The Muster cross is the best preserved: restored in the nineteenth-century, it has a small coffer as a base. The front of the London cross very closely resembles the Munster cross. The arrangement of various details such as St Peter below Christ, an angel above Christ,  Christ's posture and the two small crosses situated above his arms, link these two objects. The Virgin and St John are present on the arms of the Munster cross but have been lost from the present example.\n\nOn the London cross, the hand of God descends and is accompanied by an enamelled nimbus. The nimbus is absent from the Munster cross but does appear on the cross in Dijon. Although the musculature and sinews on the boy of Christ are similar on both the Dijon and London crosses, the treatment of the heads is quite different, with that on the Dijon cross wearing a crown. Some of the panels on the front of the Dijon cross have been replaced with panels from the back.\n\nA champlev\u00e9 enamel chasse depicting the Crucifixion and Christ in Majesty in the Louvre (OA 6183) (dated 1190-1200) also features a half-relief Christ, on which the ribs and sinews are emphasised;  suggesting a sinuous movement of the body perceptible. This treatment is considered by Abrams to be a Gothic flourish to what is otherwise a Romanesque object. The back of the chasse is decorated as with the present cross - with simple rosettes.\n\nSouchal (1967) suggested Byzantine influence for certain iconographic motifs on enamels of Limoges, such as situating the crucifix itself inside the boundaries of a cross form.  However Abrams in Enamels of Limoges (1996) points out that the design was already manifest in glazing at Potiers by the mid-twelfth century as were other elements such as the articulation of the ribs and the sinews of the arms, which he considers to obviate the need to cite Byzantine sources.",
