            "public_access_description": "Eric Ravilious (1903-1942) was already well known as a watercolourist, mural painter, designer and printmaker before his untimely death, and it was through wood-engraving that he first became recognised as an artist. He studied under Paul Nash but also found inspiration in earlier practitioners, including Thomas Bewick (1753-1828) and 15th-century German and Flemish masters. This particular image is an alternative version of a plate illustrating April in The Twelve Moneths (sic) commissioned  by Robert Gibbings for the Golden Cockerel Press. As it was not for the book, Ravilious enlarged the plate and made small variations to the composition. His strong sense of pattern and design made him one of the most successful and best-loved illustrators of his generation.",

            "bibliography": "Timmers, Margaret (ed), <i>Impressions of the Twentieth Century: Fine Art Prints from the V&A's Collection</i>, London, V&A Publications, 2001\nThe full text of the entry is as follows: \n\n\"<b>Eric William Ravilious (1903-1942)</b> \n\n<i>Boy Birdnesting</i>, 1927 \n\nAlthough Ravilious's career was cut short by the Second World War, his reputation as a watercolourist and mural painter, designer and printmaker was by then already established.  He was a prolific artist, who first became known for his wood engravings.  At the Royal College of Art he had enrolled in the School of Design, but under the tuition of the artist Paul Nash, who worked in both art and design, he was inspired in particular to learn wood engraving.  While admiring his tutor's work, Eric Ravilious also looked at the work of other engravers, such as Thomas Bewick and the fifteenth-century German and Flemish masters, who influenced him in their use of a variety of tool marks to create tones.  Their work was accessible to Ravilious through the Victoria and Albert Museum.  In 1925, after Ravilious had been working in the medium for only a year, Paul Nash proposed him as a member of the Society of Wood Engravers.  There he met Robert Gibbings, owner of the famous Golden Cockerel Press, and was soon undertaking commissions for illustration. \nThe second book Ravilious illustrated was <i>The Twelve Moneths (sic)</i> by Nicholas Breton, published in 1927; it was for this book that <i>Boy Birdnesting</i> was first designed.  <i>The Twelve Moneths</i> consisted of pages of text containing a countryman's thought on each month, facing a calendar with wood engravings above and below illustrating the text.  Within this strict format and small space Ravilious designed scenes reflecting his passionate observation of the English countryside and his skill in design and wood engraving, as well as his characteristic sense of humour.  The print shown here is, however, an alternative version to the book illustration.  Liberated from the constraints of book design, it is larger in scale, with slight variations in composition and printed in reverse. \nRavilious travelled widely around Britain sketching and painting landscapes, which he depicted from his own individual, almost eccentric viewpoint.  It is in his wood engravings that his extraordinary enthusiasm and exuberance for life is particularly apparent.  His skill in creating pattern and his strong sense of design result in a seemingly effortless lightness of touch.  His prints were then given further richness by a great variety of tonal effects - a technique that he was to develop still further in his later wood engravings.  <i>Boy Birdnesting</i> thus becomes an unforgettable image in 'praise of a perpetual English April'.\"",
