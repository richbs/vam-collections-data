The roundels worn by the Crown Prince would not bear the shou character, nor the symbols of the sun and moon, but will have the clouds of five colours. These elements are absent from the roundels in this bufu, but the four roundels of front-facing dragons indicate that the robe would have been worn by one of the other imperial princes.",
