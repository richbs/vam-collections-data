It is a subsidiary of the successful Lines Brothers and was registered in 1931 as a doll-making company. It was the year of much success for the Lines Brothers, having also bought the London toy store, Hamleys.\n\nThis particular doll, 'Baby Party' was manufactured shortly after Mattel's American version called 'Baby Fun' in 1968, which also came with party accessories such as balloons, a noise maker, horn and bubble pipe. The English version of the doll does much the same party tricks but wears a pale pink dress with matching accessories.",
