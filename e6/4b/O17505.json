The subject was a Maratha chief, the great-nephew and adopted son of Madhoji Sindhia, whom he succeeded to the Raj of Gwalior in March 1794. He was one of the main instigators of the Second Maratha War and was defeated by the British at Assaye in 1803. He reigned for 33 years and was succeeded by Jhanko Rao Sindhia.\n\n'Company paintings' were produced by Indian artists for Europeans living and working in the Indian subcontinent, especially British employees of the East India Company. They represent a fusion of traditional Indian artistic styles with conventions and technical features borrowed from western art. Some Company paintings were specially commissioned, while others were virtually mass-produced and could be purchased in bazaars.",
