Dior used firm underpinnings such as girdles, under-wired bustiers, and tulle and horsehair petticoats to achieve this. As the 1950s progressed, foundation and support garments became increasingly sophisticated. Lightweight materials such as nylon and new stretch fabrics, seen here, ensured greater comfort.\n\nThis is a ready-to-wear corset, created by Dior.  It was given to the museum when a London lingerie shop closed and gave the V&A its stock.  The original hand-written price-tag is still on the corset and gives the name of the design as \u2018Colette\u2019.  It also gives the price as \u00a38, which was just over an average week\u2019s wages in the middle of the 1950s.",
