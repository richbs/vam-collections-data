This design was awarded the Gran Premio at the Tenth Milan Triennale in 1954, in conjunction with three other designs by Day: \u2018Spectators\u2019, \u2018Linear\u2019 and \u2018Ticker-tape\u2019. Day continued to design for Heal\u2019s through the 1950s, while also producing patterns for textile firms, including Liberty and Edinburgh Weavers, as well as other furnishing companies. This design is more graphic (as the name suggests) then Day\u2019s other work, which became recognisable for its playful and energetic patterns.",
