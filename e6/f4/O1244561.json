It is child-sized, a replica of what the team members were wearing during the period of 1989-1993 on the pitch. By wearing this t-shirt, the owner would show their allegiance to a particular football team. The claret and sky-blue colouring is indicative of the team who permanently adopted these colours from their founding company, the Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding company, in 1899. The company also gave rise to the symbol of two crossed hammers which can be seen here in the jacquard and on the crest. Although, due to a funding dispute, the original name of the Thames Ironworks Football Club was dropped in 1900, once renamed West Ham the club kept the hammers insignia and this was adopted as a nickname, both for the team and for the supporters.",
