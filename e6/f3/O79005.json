The arms were used  by both the Plantagenet and the Tudor dynasties of English monarchs. It may have been made in France or England.\n\nTime\nThe style of the piece is late Gothic, and there are parallels in Northern France, Germany and The Netherlands. As yet, there are no signs of the classical influence that would have prevailed at the time in central Italy. Closer to home, there is a similarity between the massive angular folds of the angels' draperies and those of the angels on the tomb of Sir Edmund Gorges in All Saints, Wraxall, Somerset (about 1520). The poses of the angels, in an S-curve, are similar to those of angels on the tomb of Sir Richard Knightley (died 1534) in St Mary's, Fawsley, Northamptonshire.",
