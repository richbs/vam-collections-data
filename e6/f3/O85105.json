It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre of Varieties, Hanley. He compiled them in a series of albums. This shows Stratton in his opening number, \u2018My Little Octoroon\u2019. He performed it sitting on a gate and whittling a stick while waiting for his Lucy, when he heard a white man serenading her instead.\n\nStratton was born Eugene Augustus Ruhlmann in Buffalo, New York, in 1861. He appeared in the USA and Canada as a black-faced performer. He made his first appearance in Great Britain with Haveley\u2019s Minstrels at Her Majesty\u2019s Theatre in London in 1881, and then at the Piccadilly Theatre with the Moore and Burgess Minstrels, as a comedian, singer, dancer and principal tambourine man. His first success was as \u2018The Whistling Coon\u2019, an act that he bought from the veteran minstrel Sam Raeburn, and his music hall debut was in 1892 at the Royal Holborn, where he performed a soft-shoe and song and dance routine. He made his name with songs that included \u2018Lily of Laguna\u2019. He was a member of the Grand Order of Water Rats from 1893 and became its King Rat in 1896. He gave his last appearance at the Queen\u2019s Theatre, Poplar, in 1914, and died in 1918.",

            "history_note": "This caricature is of the music hall performer, minstrel, singer and dancer Eugene Stratton (1861-1918).  Born Eugene Augustus Ruhlmann in Buffalo, New York, he appeared in the States and Canada as a black-faced performer, making his first appearance in England with Haveley's Minstrels at Her Majesty's Theatre in 1881.  When they returned to the States, Stratton joined the Moore and Burgess Minstrels in Piccadilly where he worked as a comedian, singer, dancer and principal tambourine man. His first success was as 'The Whistling Coon', an act he bought from the veteran minstrel Sam Raeburn.  He made his music hall debut in 1892 at the Royal Holborn with a soft-shoe and song and dance routine and made his name with songs including 'Lily of Laguna'.  He was a member of the Grand Order of Water Rats from 1893 and its King Rat in 1896.  He gave his last appearance at the Queen's Poplar in 1914. This caricature comes from the second album of caricatures in a collection of albums owned by the Theatre Museum compiled by the graphic artist George Cooke.  It is labelled by the artist 'Geo Cooke HYS BOOKE' and features music hall performers working in the early 20th century.",
