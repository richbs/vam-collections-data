This chair was bought by the V & A as an example of Dixon's furniture in mass production, as opposed to the hand finished products from his own workshop (see W.6-1993).  In 1998 Dixon was appointed Head of Design at Habitat, the furniture store chain started by Terence Conran in 1964.\n\nDixon had no formal training except lessons in welding.  Hand crafting furniture from welded steel was central to Tom Dixon's work.  This chair was originally designed as part of a small, made to order series.  Working alongside the manufacturer, Dixon adapted this design for a wider market.\n\nThe hand-made ethos of Dixon's furniture remains in the continued use of rush upholstery.  On this model, the rush work is produced by machine, rather than by hand as can be seen on his \u2018S-Chair\u2019.",
