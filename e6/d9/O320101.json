It is single breasted and buttons up to the neck; the neck can be buttoned high to protect the neck from the elements. The large buttons are sewn to a placket and both the left and right side of the jacket have button holes for each button which means that when fasted the front is protected by triple layer. Two deep pockets have a tab button flap fastening and the sleeves have a tab fastening with two positions. Lined throughout in a red and yellow cotton twill. \n[Ski cap] Cap is made up of six segments. It has a shallow curved turned down peak at the front and leather straps with a buckle fastening for fitting the cap closely to the head. It has a soft lining of red and yellow cotton twill.\n[Ski trousers] Long trousers in black worsted twill are wide cut and gathered into cuffs (with gussets to allow the feet through) at the ankles which fasten with long ties of woollen braid. The tops are darted into a deep waist band which fastens at each side with rows of buttons. The trousers have concealed side pockets which have button fastenings. The knees and posterior are lined with waterproofed cotton. The trouser tops are part lined with a pale grey rayon and cotton twill. This material also is used for the pockets.",
