It depicts the party's two leading figures Gregor Gysi [holding the reins], the party's recently elected reformist chairman, and Hans Modrow, Prime Minister since November 1989. The date of the general election originally fixed for 6 May 1990, was brought forward to 18 March 1990 when the communist regime collapsed and an all party caretaker government was agreed on 28 January 1990.",
