The scrolled handles have acanthus leaf finials; one finial is restored. The feet are of moulded scrolls rising to acanthus leaves. The tureen is marked with the monogram 'C' over 'S' painted in black.\n\nThe lid, also with a fluted, wavy edge, has a naturalistic moulded finial of oak leaves, acorns, a lemon, a floral sprig and a caterpillar. The lobed oval stand is edged by a band of the moulded ribbon decoration as on the tureen. The handles are moulded with a stylised eagle around a rococo cartouche.",

However in 1748 he established a new porcelain and fa\u00efence factory there under the aegis of the duchesse de Maine, Louise-B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte de Bourbon-Cond\u00e9, wife of Louis-Auguste de Bourbon, duc de Maine and legitimised son of Louis XIV and Mme. de Montespan.  This royal couple had been forced to retire from court and repair to their chateau at Sceaux after having been implicated in a plot against the Regent during the minority of Louis XV.  Following the example of the Prince de Cond\u00e9 at Chantilly and the duc de Villeroy at Mennecy, they gave their protection to their local porcelain manufactory under control of de Bey.  The potter Jaccques Chapelle was de Bey's main collaborator at Sceaux.  He had learnt his trade as a  fa\u00efencier in the Paris region and then spent a significant period at the Strasbourg porcelain and fa\u00efence factory.  At Sceaux he was able to attract experienced painters, turners, mould makers, modellers and sculptors from many different factories and thus played an important part in the factory's development.  In 1754 the painter Joseph Jullien arrived.  He was to become head of the painters' workshop and finally joint Director in 1763 together with the sculptor Symphorien Jacques.\n\nIn the mid 18th century the production of French porcelain manufactories was restricted by the exclusive monopoly or privil\u00e8ge granted to the royal Vincennes (later S\u00e8vres) porcelain factory by King Louis XV in 1745.  Sceaux had initially intended to make soft-paste porcelain in Meissen style similar to Vincennes, but were forced instead to continue making fa\u00efence and porcelain often with more restrained decoration to avoid enfringing the ban on competing with Vincennes.  By the 1760s the law dictating the kinds of things factories were allowed to make was no longer so strictly enforced and the decoration at Sceaux became more varied, imitating the fashions set by S\u00e8vres.\n\nThis tureen is fa\u00efence.  Large covered serving dishes of this type were used for serving meaty stews or soups and would have provided a focus on the dining table flanked by other dishes of vegetables and salads.  This tureen with its curvaceous profile and naturalistic decoration and modelling, embodies the rococo style, which continued to be the major stylistic influence in fa\u00efence production well into the final quarter of the 18th century.",

This royal couple was forced to retire from court and repair to their chateau at Sceaux after having been implicated in a plot against the Regent during the minority of Louis XV.  Following the example of the Prince de Cond\u00e9 at Chantilly and the duc de Villeroy at Mennecy, they gave their protection to their local porcelain manufactory under the control of Louis-Fran\u00e7ois Bey.  Fortuitously he installed Jacques Chapelle as his Director.  Chapelle had learnt his trade as a fa\u00efencier in the Paris region and then spent a significant period at Strasbourg.  He was able to attract experienced painters, turners, mould makers, modellers and sculptors from many different factories and thus played an important part in the Sceaux's rise to prominence.  In 1754 the painter Joseph Jullien arrived.  He was to become head of the decoraters' workshop and finally director in 1763, jointly with the sculptor Symphorien Jacques.\nIn 1753 the duchesse de Maine died and her son, Louis-Charles de Bourbon, comte d'Eu and duc d'Aumale succeeded her as the factory's protector.  In 1759 Bey also died, leaving Chapelle as the factory's sole owner.  In 1763 Chapelle in turn took a step back from involvement at Sceaux, returning to Paris to pursue other ventures.  However, he leased the factory for nine years to Jullien and Jacques who jointly formed a company '<i>pour la fabrique et le commerce de porcelaines et de fayences</i>'.  \nThe restrictions placed on manufactories by the exclusive<i> privil\u00e8ge</i> bestowed on the royal Vincennes/S\u00e8vres porcelain factory by King Louis XV had an impact on what Sceaux was legally able to produce.  Initially the factory had intended to make soft-paste porcelain in Meissen style, but they instead made fa\u00efence and porcelain with no gilding or figure decoration, concentrating on floral decoration.  by the 1760s the law dictating what factories were allowed to make was no longer so strictly enforced and the decoration became more varied, imitating the fashions set by S\u00e8vres.",
