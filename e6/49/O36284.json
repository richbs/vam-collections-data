The wheel axles were held in place by nails, some of which still exist. \n1. craft, carved wood painted a mid blue. It has an open well divided by a central bar, lights at the front and a hatch lid; at the back is a raised `hatch' covered with canvas which has also been painted. ACTION MAN TRANSPORT COMMAND decals have been placed at the back and a printed control panel where the driver would stand. \n2. steering wheel, black plastic. It was stuck in the centre below the control panel. \n3,4. side wings for the windscreen, wood painted the same blue; these were stuck on \n5. windscreen, wood painted the same blue; it was stuck on. \n6. Fibreglass craft, painted the same blue. Although very similar it shows some refinements to the original wooden model. Two further `hatches' have been added to the front, the lamp tops cut down, extra fuel tanks and a fully designed hatch top added to the back, and rough walkways, extra seating and rope grips have also been cast into the product. It was also designed to require only three pairs of wheels, one at the front and two sets at the back. Loop attachments have been added to the front and rear.",
