            "public_access_description": "This is a folio from a manuscript of the Uttaradhyayanasutra, a Jain text. Jainism is one of the oldest living religions in the world and had emerged in India by around the 6th century BC. Its best-known ideal is non-violence. Jains revere 24 Jinas (spiritual victors) or Tirthankaras (fordmakers), who showed the way to achieve liberation from the ocean of birth and rebirth. \n\nThe Uttaradhyayanasutra is believed by members of the Shvetambara sect of Jains to contain the last teachings of Mahavira, the 24th and last Jina, considered to be the historical founder of Jainism. This canonical text is concerned with the rules of behaviour that govern monastic life. The Uttaradhyayanasutra is classified as a \u2018Mula\u2019 or \u2018fundamental\u2019 work of Jain scripture.\n\nThis Uttaradhyayanasutra manuscript is one of the earliest known illustrated versions. It lacks the lavish use of gold and ultramarine blue seen in many contemporary and later manuscripts but its fine illustrations are notable for the quality of line, harmonious colour balances and the often lively and unusual compositions.\n\nThe painting illustrates beautifully the strength of will that a monk must exert to honour his vows of chastity. Here, a Shvetambara monk, clad in white, diaphanous robes, stares out of the picture impassively. Two beautiful young women, dressed in rich garments and jewels, attempt to engage his attention. Female musicians and a dancer add to the distractions. \n\nThe monk is depicted frontally, with the cool passivity of a sculpture. The women are enlivened by the daring combination of a three-quarter view for head and torso and full profile for the feet. The fluttering of sari ends, breast shawl, and long, plaited hair all add to the sense of animation.",

This canonical text set out the rules of behaviour for the monastic community.\n\nJain monks have traditionally been supported by a much larger lay community, who gained spiritual merit by commissioning manuscripts, which were preserved in temple libraries. Jainism has two sects, Shvetambara and Digambara, and the illustrated manuscript to which this folio belongs was painted for Jains of the Shvetambara sect. Surviving Jain manuscripts show that a distinctive Western Indian painting style had developed by the 12th century. \n\nThe earliest Jain manuscripts were written on palm leaf with painted wooden covers but during the 14th century paper came into general use for illustrated manuscripts. One feature that can be seen in this manuscript is the interruption of the text with a lozenge-shaped blank space to allow for the perforation of a binding cord. In fact, no such hole has been made. This is a reminder that medieval paper manuscripts in this format were still following in some respects the conventions of the long narrow strips of the palm-leaf manuscript.\n\nThis manuscript bears a later colophon stating that it was produced at Stambhatirtha in Cambay on the Gujarat coast, which was a major port and hub of Jain mercantile activity.",
