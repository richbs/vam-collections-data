            "bibliography": "W. Graham Robertson, <i>Time Was: the reminiscences of W. Graham Robertson</i>, London: Hamish Hamilton, 1931, p.278\n'Another magnificent canvas of colossal size, <i>The Car of Love</i> never reached completion, but was luckily left at a moment when the whole design had been painted in and modelled in monochrome, the colour as yet hardly suggested. In this state, though unfinished, the picture can be seen as a whole and reveals itself as one fo the painter's very grandest conceptions...\n   Above us towered the great picture, reaching from floor to roof.\n   High aloft, fast bound to his own triumphal car, stood the figure of blind Love, himself at once the god and the sacrifice; behind him swirled splendid masses of wind-blown drapery, leaving the white body naked.\n   The car, mounted on hugh wheels, swept down a narrow street leaving no space on either side and before it, drawing it along by cords, ran a crowd of naked men and women, some laughing and shouting as they sped along, others looking back with growing terror as they realised that the great car was now moving by its own impetus and that they must run on and on or be crushed  beneath its weight.'\nGeorgiana Burne-Jones, <i>Memorials of Edward Burne-Jones</i>, London and New York: the Macmillan Company, 1904, vol. 2, pp. 191-2\n'Carefully and deliberately as Edward chose his subjects, he would occasionally seek advice about carrying out a particular one, listening thoughtfully to anything for or against it. <i>Love's Wayfaring</i> was an instance of this, which seems curious when one remembers it was a design that came to him suddenly, as a whole, and was never greatly altered. Still, there was some hesitation in his mind as to the subject, and the large scale on which it was planned made it important that he should not be likely for any reason to tire of it - \"for the time is shortening and I must do my best now, and waste no days that can be helped.\" So in 1890 he wrote to Mrs. George Lewis, a friend whose sincerity he trusted: \n   \"I've been wanting to ask you a thing - a piece of advice. I have been wondering whether a certain design I made many years ago and liked then, is really good enough to begin now and carry through. The design of it used to be in my studio, a black rough charcoal thing done in a heat in one evening, very rough and coarse to look at. I have long since put it out of sight - I daresay you never saw it, so I send a little photograph of it. \n   \"It's the old story with me - Love and his overdriven steeds. If you think that there is a little degradation in the driven creatures I won't do it, but if you think it shews one side of the truth that it right to give I will presently begin it. I know you have my work at heart a little and will tell me the truth to my face just as you would say it to any one else. That's the sea at the back and there will be a rocky gorge of cliffs to make the road narrow for them - alternate men and women, some laughing and some very much not - and in the picture they would be harnessed together with carefully designed thongs. Sometimes I have thought it would do, and sometimes it has terrified me and seemed a little degraded. I want to use my time very carefully and do only my very best. Will you think it over from many sides and tell me by and bye, and you will find great novelty in a friend who will really follow your advice..\"\n   The picture was gone on with and a world of work spent upon it, but it remains unfinished. The background alone was changed, for a steep, narrow street in an ancient city has been substituted for the sea and cliffs. The figure of Love is exactly as he saw it first, expressing might only, and no pity.'\nPhilip Burne-Jones, 'Notes on some unfinished works of Sir Edward Burne-Jones', <i>Magazine of Art</i>, vol. XXIV, 1900, pp.159-167 (p.166)\n'The large unfinished painting at the end of the room [in a photograph of E B-J's studio after his death], <i>Love's Wayfaring</i>, was a work which my father had much at heart to finish; and he would probably have turned to it as soon as <i>Arthur in Avalon</i> had been completed. But this was not to be. Though the design for the picture was begun so long ago as 1871 (there is a note in the diary in 1872 mentioning it as one of four subjects \"which above all others I desire to paint, and count my chief designs for some years to come\"), it was only comparatively recently (1895) that the picture itself was started upon its present scale.'\nJohn Christian and Stephen Wildman, <i>Edward Burne-Jones, Victorian artist-dreamer</i>, New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1998, pp.143, 145, 148, 266",

            "history_note": "<i>The Car of Love</i> was given to the V&A by Lady Burne-Jones in 1909.\n\nHistorical significance: Edward Burne-Jones was the leading figure in the second phase of the Pre-Raphaelite movement. His paintings of subjects from medieval legend and Classical mythology and his designs for stained glass, tapestry and many other media played an important part in the Aesthetic Movement and the history of international Symbolism. \n\nThe triumphal procession of Love was a common theme in Medieval and Renaissance literature and art. However, the specific basis of Burne-Jones's composition in <i>The Car of Love</i>is a long allegorical poem by the 14th-century Italian poet Petrarch, the <i>Trionfi</i>or Triumphs. The poet has a vision of a number of victorious pageants or triumphal processions, in which historical, Biblical or mythological figures take part. The first triumph is that of Love over the human heart; the next is Chastity, which triumphs over Love; followed in turn by Death, Fame, Time, and finally Eternity, which triumphs over all. \n\nIn this unfinished painting Burne-Jones shows Cupid, the god of love, being pulled on a great chariot down a narrow city street by a crowd of men and women. Some laugh, others appear anguished. The architectural background is based on the narrow streets of Medieval Siena.\n\nBurne-Jones first conceived the idea for <i>The Car of Love</i>in 1871 or 1872, but work on the large painting in the V&A did not begin until the early 1890s. It was left incomplete at Burne-Jones's death in 1898.  \n\nOne large design (339.1 x 211.2 cm) in pastel and charcoal for <i>The Car of Love</i>is in the Auckland Art Gallery, New Zealand (museum number 1924/5/1; see exhibition catalogue: Auckland City Art Gallery, <i>British Taste in the Nineteenth Century,</i>May 1962, no.10, p.9). This design was presented to Auckland Art Gallery in 1924 by Viscount Leverhulme. There are also three black chalk figure studies for the painting in Auckland (museum numbers 1956/22/1; 1956/22/2; 1956/22/3). \n \nAn earlier design, probably the sketch referred to in <i>Memorials,</i>pp. 191-2, as 'a black rough charcoal thing done in a heat one evening', is in Falmouth Art Gallery (charcoal on paper stuck to canvas, 162 x 89cm, FAMAG: 1923.19; see image in object file). This design shows Burne-Jones's original concept of the composition, in which the procession takes place in a narrow gorge, with towering rocks on either side and a glimpse of the sea in the background. The streets of medieval Siena replaced this setting in the final composition. \n\nTwo head studies for <i>The Car of Love</i>are in Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery (1898P48 (1880) and 1898P49 (1875)). \n\nAnother head study, signed 'E.B.J.', dated 1895, and inscribed (apparently by the artist) 'for the CAR of LOVE' was offered for sale at TEFAF Maastricht and the Salon du Dessin in Paris in 2013.
