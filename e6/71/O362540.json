Full length and made with a double collar gathered onto a narrow upstanding band. Semi-circular shoulder yolk to which the body of the cloak is attached. At the centre back there is a double box pleat.  There are further double box pleats at either side of the front opening while at the shoulders there are additional deep double pleats moving from front to back. The shoulders are supported inside with semi-circular pads made from lining fabric and held with strips of elastic in a lining casing. The cloak is lined with matching silk tussore.  It fastens with alternating gold hooks with silk worked metal eyes. Inside the cloak, at the right of the front, there is a band of lining to hold the cloak and there are traces of one on the left. At the neck there is a hanging loop.",
