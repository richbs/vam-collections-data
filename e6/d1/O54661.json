It is jointed at the neck, shoulders, elbows, wrists and hips. The joints are all metal. There are small metal attachments for the strings on the head, back, upper arms, stomach, thighs and back left leg, with holes in the hands for similar attachment. There are several pieces of black stringing remaining in a very tangled state. The upper part of the figure is human , the lower deerlike with hooves. The body is painted with the lower part marked denoting green skin. There are two wooden musical pipes, one still attached to the left hand. They can be pulled and held to the mouth by means of white thread. The hands are out of proportion to the rest of the figure and are painted a different colour. The facial features are boldly carved and painted with green lips and closed black eyes. The ears are pointed. The hair is of white thread glued into close curls. The figure wears a necklace of green felt leaves and white pearl beads.",
