A promoter of democracy, The National Peasants' Party was re-established in Romania in 1990 by former party members such as Corneliu Coposu and Ion Diaconescu under the name The National Peasants'-Christian Democrat Party (PNT-CD). Between 1992 and 1996 the PNT-CD was the main opposition party in Romania. Between 1996 and 2000 it was the governing party. In the November 2000 elections the PNT-CD failed to gain any seats in Parliament. This poster from the 1990 election campaign reproduces a painting by the well-known artist Nicolae Grigorescu (1838-1907). He was a forerunner of Romanian modern painting, whose art is defined by his interest in the rural world. The portrait of the peasant woman with the wool spindle is one of his iconic paintings. The 1990 election was the first democratic election in Romania after the overthrow of communism.",
