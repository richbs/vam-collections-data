By the beginning of the 7th century large quantities of silver pieces with exotic shapes and styles were imported along the Silk Road from Iran and Central Asia to China. During the same period Chinese craftsmen also acquired new manufacturing techniques from Central Asian silversmiths who had settled in Chinese urban centres beginning in the mid 7th century.\n\nThis censer consists of two hemispherical shells which are locked together by a bayonet fitting to form a sphere. A series of rings inside one another were attached to one half to ensure that the central saucer remained upright even when the incense burner was rolled around. This device was invented by the Chinese in about the 2nd century and probably derived from the armillary spheres used by astronomers.",
