Such locks were often carried by their owners when travelling and used in different residences.\n\nHistorical Association\nThe lock bears the arms of Cosimo III de' Medici.  He visited London in 1669, the year before he became Grand Duke of Tuscany, and possibly ordered this lock on that occasion.  The maker, Richard Bickford, was the most famous locksmith in London and a visit to his shop would have been on the itinerary of an important visitor.\n\nMaker\nThe lock is signed on the rim by Richard Bickford.  He was one of a family of locksmiths who worked for wealthy patrons.  A few years earlier the Bickfords had made a jewel casket for Queen Mary, also displayed in the British Galleries.\n\nDesign & Materials\nThe ornament on this lock is similar to other fine metalwork by the Bickfords. It consists of finely chiselled, pierced and engraved gilt brass, mounted above panels of blued steel which provide a vivid and brilliant colour contrast.",
