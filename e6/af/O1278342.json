Under the leadership of Etienne Lescroart in 1967 a Paris office was opened named Dentelle Sophie after his niece. Lescroart\u2019s son Bruno later joined the company and grew the export business considerably taking over fully in the year 2000. Sophie Hallette now employs over 400 people and supplies lace for many couture houses, they specialise in fine machine made lace made on English leavers and bobbin looms, imported in the 19thcentury , and  woven to both traditional and modern designs.\n\nThe seemingly random trails of flowers and foliage in this length of lace, features shamrocks, roses and lilies. The pattern, which was archived for 20 years, was originally conceived in 1958 and named \"Pattern 953070\".  In 2012 the design, was selected for the lace used in the wedding dress of the Duchess of Cambridge designed by Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen, it has now been re-christened \"Kate's lace\" in the Duchess's honour.",
