            "bibliography": "Parkinson, R., Victoria and Albert Museum, <u>Catalogue of British Oil Paintings 1820-1860</u>, London: HMSO, 1990, p. 105\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\"FRITH, William Powell, RA (1819-1909)\n\nBorn Aldfield, near Ripon, Yorkshire, 9 January 1819, son of a butler (an amateur artist) and a cook. Studied at Sass's Academy from 1835; entered RA Schools. In a long, prolific, and highly successful career, exhibited 107 works at the RA between 1840 and 1906, 13 at the BI 1838-1857, and 12 at the Society of British Artists 1838-1883. Subjects predominantly literary, historical, and - most notably - scenes of contemporary life, with which he achieved his greatest popular fame, amplified by many engraved reproductions, beginning with <i>Ramsgate Sands</i> (exh RA 1854 and bought by Queen Victoria). In 1875 his <i>Dinner at Boswell's</i> ... of 1869 sold at Christie's for \u00a34567, the highest price ever achieved by a living artist. Member of 'The Clique' in the 1840s; elected ARA 1845, RA 1852. Died Sr John's Wood, London, 2 November 1909; there had been a studio sale at Christie's 14 June 1884. The <i>Art Journal</i> obituarist wrote: 'the artist will be missed: he was an institution'. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1856, pp237-40 (for other references to Frith in the <i>Art Union</i> and <i>Art Journal</i>, see the entry in C Wood <i>Dictionary of Victorian Painters</i> 1971); W P Frith <i>My Autobiography and Reminiscences</i> 3 vols 1887-8; <i>Times</i> 4 November 1909 (obit); <i>Art Journal</i>191O, p14 (obit); Mrs J Panton <i>Leaves from a Life</i> 1909, <i>More Leaves from a Life</i> 1911; W P <i>Frith</i> Whitechapel Art Gallery exhibition catalogue 1951; N Wallis <i>A Victorian Canvas</i> 1957; J Mass <i>Gambart: Prince of the Victorian art world</i> 1975; A Noakes <i>William Frith: Extraordinary Victorian Painter</i> 1978.\n\n<b>Scene from 'Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme': Madame jourdain finds her Husband Entertaining Dorim\u00e8ne and Dorante</b> \n538-1882 Neg L811 \nCanvas, 44.5 x 57.2 cm (17\u00bd x 22\u00bd ins) \nJones Bequest 1882 \n\nA reduced replica of the painting exhibited at the RA in 1846 (496); its present whereabouts are unknown (but see below) and what is presumably the oil sketch (18. 4 x 23.8 cm (7\u00bc x 9 ins, not inscribed) is in the City Art Gallery, Manchester. The RA picture was commissioned by the Birmingham banker John Gibbons, who had also commissioned the 'Village Pastor' exhibited at the RA in 1845. Frith records that an 'eccentric gentleman' paid Gibbons three times the price soon after, from which Gibbons gave Frith 50 guineas. \n\nFrith was working on the painting for Gibbons when he was elected ARA in 1845, and wrote: 'I think neither of these pictures [the other was 'The Return from Labour', also exhibited at the RA in 1846] fulfilled the expectations raised by the 'Village Pastor', either in my friends or myself; and I felt the imperative necessity of immediately embarking on some subject of such importance as should justify my election, by the manner in which I should execute the work'. That subject seems to have been 'An English Merry-making' (see 510-1882 p99.) \n\nIn the RA catalogue the title and accompanying quotation is given as follows: \n\nMadame Jourdain discovers her husband at the dinner which he gave to the Belle Marquise and the Count Dorante. \n\n<i>Mme Jourdain</i>: Ah, ah! Je trouve ici bonne compagnie, et je vois bien qu'on ne m'y attendait pas. C'est done pour cette belle affaire-ci, monsieur mon mari, que vous avez en tant d'empressment \u00e0 m'envoyer diner chez ma soeur? Voila comme vous d\u00e9pensez votre bien; et c'est ainsi que vous festiniez les dames en mon absence. \n\nThe lines are from act 4 scene 2 of Moli\u00e8re's play <i>Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme</i>. For comment on Frith's Moli\u00e8re subjects see 537-1882 p103. \n\nThe <i>Athenaeum</i> critic thought of the RA work: 'The story is well represented, for those who know it ... to others this picture does not tell its tale'. This remark bears out that Moli\u00e8re's plays were not popular in the 19th-century London theatre (see the comments on 537-1882 p103). The <i>Art Union</i> was more enthusiastic: 'The characters are admirably made out, are sustained most efficiently, and the scene has the great merit of rather representing real life than dramatic superficialities . . . This picture is assuredly one of the best of the dramatic series that was for years hung upon these walls'. \n\nIt seems certain that this replica and the 'Scene from The Bourgeois Gentilhomme' (537-1882 p103) were painted as pendants; they are almost the same size, and correspond in details such as costume (except that Jourdain seems to have lost his moustache between the entrance hall and the dining-room). It is tempting to suggest that the characters are portraits of actors, but as Moli\u00e8re was so rarely performed, and Frith only mentioned in his autobiography the model for Dorim\u00e8ne, it seems unlikely. \n\nENGR: Lithograph J H Maguire \n\nLIT: (RA picture) <i>Athenaeum</i> 16 May 1846, p503; <i>Art Union</i> 1846, p182; <i>A Picture Gallery of British Art</i> 1873, p69; <i>Autobiography</i> I, pp113-4, 117, 122, 213 \n\n<i>Version</i>: Exhibited RA 1846 (496); Phillip's 25 July 1983 (182, 79 x 100 cm (31? x 38? ins), signed and dated 1846, repr in colour), bought \u00a35200.
