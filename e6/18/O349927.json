The style and the facial type however, recapitulate formulae of Upper Rheinisch sculpture of the early 16th century.\n\nIt is suggested that the Virgin was made by a follower of the sculptor Hans Wydyz, a sculptor of whom not much is known about. Wydyz was active in Freiburg/Breisgau, where he was recorded from 1497 to 1510, and probably later in Strasbourg.",
