The main ground of the tile is cobalt blue with the outer edge defined by a turquoise outline. At the centre of the tile is a small 6-pointed star in turquoise, which interlocks with a slightly larger 6-pointed star left in reserve (white). From each of the points of the white star a branch extends which divides into two back-to-back split palmettes. These all join up to form an 8-pointed star, which combines geometric and vegetal forms. Smaller flowers fill each of the points of the 12-pointed star, whose outlines are left in reserve, but details are added in red and turquoise pigments. Lotus-style flowers fill the gap between the interlocking 6-pointed stars at the centre of the tile, and the biomorphic 8-pointed star; these are outlined in red and infilled with gold leaf. A small round flower at the very centre of the tile is also outlined in red and infilled with gold leaf.",
