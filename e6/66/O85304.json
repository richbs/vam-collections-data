This was an old Italian card game, the basis for two very popular 18th-century games, hombre and quadrille.  Card playing was a necessary accomplishment for those hoping to take their place in polite society and all manner of people played at many levels of society. Such counter boxes would have been a luxurious and fashionable accessory for a card player of either sex. The outer box lid also features characters from the Commedia dell'arte; a singular Pierrot (the sad clown, pining for Columbine) at the bottom of the lid, with two sets of diametrically placed images of the lovers Harlequin and Columbine towards the centre. Centrally on the large box, and on either side of the ivory dial on each smaller box, are two central busts which may represent the Dauphin Louis Ferdinand and his second Dauphine Marie Josephe de Saxe.\n\nThe boxes and counters were colour coded to relate to the suits of a pack of cards.  Green was for clubs, red for spades, yellow for diamonds and white for hearts. These boxes may have been made by, or in the workshop of, Mariaval. We know little about him, except that he obviously had a large trade in such items, as many sets survive.  He may have been the son of the engraver to the king.",

Such boxes are traditionally attributed to a <i>tabletier</i>, a maker of small boxes, of this name, who worked in Paris and, possibly, Rouen. A notarial deed dated 1727 records the name of a Claude-Fran\u00e7ois Mariaval who was engraver to the king (<i>graveur du roi</i>).  This could be the maker of the boxes, or more likely, it was his son who made them. \n\nSets of boxes decorated in the same technique appear regularly at auction and others are held by museums, including the Mus\u00e9es des Arts D\u00e9coratifs in Paris, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge and the Lady Lever Art Gallery, Port Sunlight. One or more of the boxes in most of these sets is signed by Mariaval. \n\nThe boxes must have been made in the years around the middle of the 18th century, although in a rather old-fashioned style of decoration.  They show portrait profiles of Louis Ferdinand, Dauphin of France (1729-1765) and his second wife, Marie Josephe de Saxe (1731-1767) who did not marry until 1747.",
