Several Staffordshire factories specialised in moulded earthenware portrait figurines which were based on prints, decorated by hand and sold cheaply. It has been suggested that this figurine represents the famous 19th century comedian John Liston as Ali Baba at Covent Garden Theatre in 1818.  However, in The Forty Thieves first produced at Covent Garden on 27 September 1818, Ali Baba was played by William Blanchard (1769-1835).  Blanchard was an English comedian who worked as an actor in the provinces from 1875 and made his first appearance in London at Covent Garden Theatre in 1800 as Bob Acres in Sheridan's play The Rivals. Apart from a short appearance in New York in 1831, Blanchard remained at Covent Garden until his death.\n\nA companion to this figurine was issued representing the character Morgiana, played in the 1818 production by Maria Foote (1797-1867). She was also portrayed in other Staffordshire figurines, notably as the jockey Arinette.",
