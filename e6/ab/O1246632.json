One adult would play the face and upper body, and placed their hands into the boots to look like legs. Another adult, standing behind, would put their arms through the armpits of the one in front. Then curtains would be drawn across to hide this device from the audience.\nThere was a table in front of the curtains with a stool on it, and the 'prince' sat cross legged on the stool. During the performance, a member of the audience would be asked to remove the stool, leaving the prince apparently suspended in mid-air.",
