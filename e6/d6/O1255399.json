It is a loom width, with a seam near the lower edge attaching an addition small section of silk that allows the pattern repeat to be seen complete. There is a narrow line of silk with a cut edge stitched to the top, suggesting another panel was joined previously, and has been cut off. A short length of linen tape is attached to the reverse.\n\nThe silk is  cream in plain weave brocaded in four shades of brown, with self-coloured ground weft floats creating delicate floral sprays in the background. In the foreground the brown brocading creates floral swags across the width of the silk.",

The technique of  brocading allowed different colours to be introduced into the pattern of a fabric in specific, sometimes very small areas. It was a more laborious process for the weaver than using patterning wefts running from selvedge to selvedge, but the  resulting effect could be much more varied and lively.",
