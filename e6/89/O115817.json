U-shaped body , on low foot, with high, short down-curving pouring spout and the following separately carved or turned parts; strap handle (secured by metal pin); and low domed cover with detachable button-shaped knob. The body is hollow, and the cover sits on a separately turned and applied ring. Made from fine white dental plaster, the components turned on a lathe (body, cover, knob, and internal ring) or carved by hand (spout and handle). The resin only penetrates 2-3cm and greatly strengthens the model making it possible to achieve thinner dimensions, a method suggested by ceramics conservation treatments that Queensberry Hunt witnessed at the V&A Museum.",

            "public_access_description": "Queensberry Hunt is one of the few ceramic design groups to make design models today (2005) and still have the skills to do so (most of their competitors use Computer Aided Design software). They do so because they believe a model creates a better sense of what the finished product will be like. Martin Hunt makes full-size models in resin impregnated plaster for the major pieces of any tableware range commissioned from the partnership. He makes these to the finished 'fired size' of the article (the intended size after the clay has shrunk during firing). These are used to create scaled drawings of object at 'clay size' (before firing and shrinkage), and the dimensions may also be adjusted to meet the required capacity for hollow-ware at this stage. These drawings are then sent to the manufacturing pottery, who prepare a larger, working model (in which allowance for shrinkage has been made). These working models are used to make sets of plaster moulds in which the finished table-wares are made.",
