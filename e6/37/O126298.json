It seems, in fact, to combine  some of the bold texturing effects found in Palmer\u2019s \u2018visionary\u2019 work with the more careful features of his nature studies. The drawing is presumably a study of a house on the slopes rising above Shoreham. It shows Palmer using the motif of view into a valley cut off by a foreground slope that recurs in several  of his early Shoreham works, notably the <i>Holy Family</i> (cat. 28). Another view of a \u2018primitive cottage\u2019 \u2013 possibly the same building from another angle \u2013 is in the Yale Center for British Art (Lister 98).\u2019\nRobert Hoozee, ed. <u> British Vision.
