It is veneered in amboyna wood, which has rich markings and sets off well the large-scale gilt-bronze mounts. The mounts, which show different figures of Venus, may have been made by the gilt-bronze specialist Pierre-Philippe Thomire. A close friend and business associate of one of the Jacob brothers, Thomire was famous for making large-scale mounts of high quality such as this.\n\nLittle is known of the history of this cabinet, but it belonged in 1969 to the Ruspoli Talleyrand Collection in the Villa Imperiale in Florence. It may originally have come from the collection of Napoleon I's minister, the Duc de Talleyrand. The high quality of both design and materials would be appropriate for such a client, but it is also possible that the cabinet was simply purchased by his descendants at some time in the 19th century.",
