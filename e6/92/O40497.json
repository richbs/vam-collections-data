While she produced portraits and cityscapes she mainly worked as a landscape artist.\n\nThis drawing in India ink shows figure studies of Apollo and the metamorphosis of the nymph Daphne in to a laurel tree. The story from Greek Mythology tells of how to take revenge for Apollo criticising him for carrying weapons of war, Eros shot a golden arrow at Apollo to incite love for Daphne but shot a lead arrow at the nymph so that she would in turn hate the God. These sketches represent the climax of the story where, as he catches up with Daphne she calls her father Peneus to help change her form and just as Apollo grasps her in his arms the nymph turns in to a laurel tree. Fine lines have been used to create the figure of Apollo and that of Daphne, who is cropped by the edge of the page. There is a feeling of movement from the curving lines of the robes that fall over the God's limbs as he runs after the nymph. The long nose, wide eyes and curled locks of hair follow antique sculpture conveying a feeling of the period of this story from Greek Mythology.",
