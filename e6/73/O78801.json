There was then  a need for numerous furnishings for the country houses being built at the time. Such hangings were at the top end of the  luxury market, however, and far less common than  embroidered ones made of less expensive materials, such as linen canvas and wool.\n\nOwnership & Use\nIt is probable that a donation by a wealthy nobleman or woman of this rich embroidered hanging to a church resulted in its survival, since it was subsequently made into a chasuble (the liturgical garment that a  priest wore for Mass). Donations or bequests of this kind were often made either by a genuinely pious donor or patron or by  one who sought to influence the church, or  gain favour in it.\n\nMakers & Making\nThe richness of the materials, the workmanship and the combination of  black  and red,  two of the most favoured colours (and expensive ones in terms of dyeing),  with gold thread make this a most luxurious embroidery. It would have been produced in a  professional workshop, possibly in London.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe design includes  favoured elements from English sources. The Tudor rose is the symbol most immediately associated with the Tudor dynasty.  The acorn with oak leaf is also an archetypal English motif.",
