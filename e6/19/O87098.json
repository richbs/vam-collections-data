He and Marie Motramo were billed as \u2018musical and comedy artistes\u2019. It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre. He compiled them in a series of albums.\n\nWhen the act appeared at Hanley in September 1904, it was billed as Algie and Marie Motramo. A local review described the duo as \u2018eccentric musicians, but pre-eminently humorous dialoguists\u2019. Whenever they performed the act at Hanley, it was with \u2018Do You Reverse?\u2019. This was a comedy musical act, possibly about a couple of dancers. Tom Motramo is seen here as a rather gormless \u2018toff\u2019, presumably his stage character for the act. He added the inscription \u2018Do you reverse?\u2019 to the caricature, along with his signature and date.",
