This example is very finely knit by hand in plain silk yarn and silk partially wrapped in silver thread, in contrasting colours of blue and yellow.  Characteristic of this style of jacket, it has a border of basket weave stitch and an abstract floral design worked in stocking and reverse stocking stitches.  The pattern imitates the designs seen in woven silk textiles.  The jacket is finely finished with the sleeves lined in silk and completed with knitted cuffs.  Along each centre front, a narrow strip of linen covered in blue silk has been added, with button holes and passementerie buttons, worked in silver thread.  The provenance of the jacket indicates that it is probably Italian.",
