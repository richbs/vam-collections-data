            "historical_context_note": "Friedrich the Wise of Saxony (1463-1525) was a powerful Catholic potentate who inherited a massive collection of reliquaries in the church of All Saints in Wittenberg but late in life converted to the Lutheran cause. To D\u00fcrer's relief, the Elector ensured the safe protection of Luther in his castle at the Wartburg when the reformer's life was endangered following his excommunication in 1521. Friedrich the Wise was D\u00fcrer's earliest significant patron, and his commission of a painted portrait in 1496 was a major work that stimulated others to patronzie the young artist. Friedrich's later commissions included D\u00fcrer's magnificent 'Adoration of the Magi' of 1504 and the 'Martyrdom of the Ten Thousand' in 1508 as well as other altarpieces.\n\nThis engraving shows an elderly Friedrich the year before his death. It is based on a silverpoint drawing in Paris (Ecole des Beaux-Arts; Strauss 1524/I). As with his portrait of Ulrich Varnb\u00fcler, D\u00fcrer has taken the unusual step of signing the print in full, [as well as including his monogram AD above the left shoulder of the sitter.]\n\nFrom 'Albrecht D\u00fcrer and His Legacy - The Graphic Work of a Renaissance Artist', Giulia Bartrum with contributions by G\u00fcnter Grass, Joseph L. Koerner and Ute Kuhlemann; British Museum Press; 2002\n\nFrom 'The Illustrated Bartsch'\n\n'In contrast to the strict profile of [Durer's] portrait of Cardinal Albrecht of Brandenburg, Durer pictures Frederick the Wise almost full-face. The engraving is based on a prepartory drawing (SD.1524/1), presumably drawn during Frederick's stay in Nuremberg between November 1522 and February 1523. As in most of his later portraits, Durer shows the reflection of a window in the pupils of his sitter, perhaps symbolizing the eye as the window of the soul.'",
