Originally designed by the Jacques company in 1851 with caricature illustrations by John Tenniel, it has been produced by numerous publishers ever since. This version, from the Pepys company, dates from the 1950s. Although the illustrations have moved away from linking stereotypes of facial features with professions, this pack instead uses the traditional dress of different countries, with a remit to educate children about the different cultures of the world.\n\nPepys were a British card game manufacturer between 1938 and 1978, whose hallmark was the high quality of the artwork they produced. They made many variations on themes, on only a few differing children's card games.",
