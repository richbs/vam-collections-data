The dresses are ballerina length, with full skirts and low cut bodices. The lady in the left, in Worth, has a ruched bodice with a narrow decorative halter-neck strap applied to the sides of the bodice and going up and round the back of her neck, and is holding a large fur stole behind her back. The lady on the right is wearing a black faille Stiebel dress with off-the-shoulder neckline and short sleeves, held up with shoulder straps, and decorated with large applied velvet flowers accented with diamant\u00e9s. She carries a small clutch bag and wears a pleated wrap and black elbow gloves.\n\nPencil notes give designer, fabric and colour notes. Although partially cut away, enough remains of the Stiebel notes to identify the designer and fabrics:\n\n<i>Stei</i>[bel, (sic)]\n<i>black fa</i>[ille]\n<i>and vel</i>[vet]\n<i>and dia</i>[mant\u00e9]",

            "public_access_description": "This is an original artwork for a fashion illustration by Marcel Fromenti for The Lady, a weekly magazine for women published since 1885. At the time it was made, Fromenti was the main artist for The Lady's fashion articles. The glamorous women in his drawings modelled both couture and high-end ready-to-wear garments with equal panache and elegance. Couture dresses and suits by leading Paris and London couturiers such as Christian Dior, Pierre Balmain and Norman Hartnell were drawn with the same flair as designs from British ready-to-wear labels such as Susan Small, Roecliff & Chapman, and Marcus. The articles described the fashion developments of their day in simple, accessible terms that contributed greatly to The Lady's popularity with its readers. Pencil notes record the designers, fabric and colour details, alongside technical instructions to the printers as to how these images should be incorporated into the printed page and at what scale.",
