In the days before radio and television, comedians were often famous within a fairly restricted area and humour, too, showed many local variations - there were many comedians famous in the north of England who never performed in the south, and vice versa.  \nJudge developed several characters for his act.  This exaggerated ly country suit, of bold tweeds, with jodhpurs and gaiters was clearly for a 'crusty'  farmer or country gentleman character, which would have been in keeping with Judge's reputation as 'The Norfolk Comedian.'  Such costumes are rare because, once they had evolved, the performer would wear them until they fell apart.  The jacket has the label of a tailor in Beccles; while it may have been made for Judge, it is more likely that he acquired it second hand as the ideal costume for that particular character.",

Although he performed all over the British Isles, occasionally in London, he was best known in East Anglia and the North of England; at this period, before the spread of radio and the invention of television, comedians were often 'local' and humour in the North could be very different from that in the South (for example, Max Miller was never as popular in the North of England, while Jimmy Learmouth was most popular in his native Lancashire).  He played Dame in pantomime and married Gertrude Orchard, who played Principal Boy.  His Dame characters, while obviously exaggerated, inclined towards the 'elegant' or homely rather than the grotesque.  This costume is one of many 'characters' that formed part of his act;   photographs of him wearing it show an old, presumably 'crusty' country character.",
