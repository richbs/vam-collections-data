Pentagram described the new packaging design solution by John McConnell, as 'simple boxes printed in one colour thereby avoiding a glossy mass-manufactured image' to 'reflect the \"homegrown\" quality of the product whilst making it appear as appetising as possible'. This wood engraved illustration of the product, by George Tute (born 1933) , was intended 'to be both appealing and technically accurate'.",
