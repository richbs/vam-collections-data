It is a copy of part of a chimneypiece in grey sandstone acquired by the Museum in 1859 (inv.no. 5896-1859). The chimneypiece is now attributed to the workshop in Florence of Desiderio da Settignano, an important sculptor in mid-fifteenth-century Italy. Nothing is known concerning the amateur British sculptor George T. Sherborne who made this copy.\n\nDesiderio da Settignano, (Desiderio de Bartolomeo di Francesco detto Ferro - c. 1428 or 1430 \u2013 1464) was an Italian sculptor active during the Renaissance. He came from a family of stone carvers and stonemasons. His work is influenced by Donatello, but very likley he was trained in the large Florentine workshop run by Bernardo and Antonio Rossellino.",
