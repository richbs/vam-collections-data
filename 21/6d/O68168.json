Towering over them on a much larger scale is a  female figure in a dance pose and dance costume. She is surrounded  by a bold orange outline which contrasts with the purple background of the rest of the poster. The titles are at the bottom of the poster in yellow. The famous Gemini film logo of two boys in loin cloths blowing trumpets in-cased in a circle is in a prominent position by the titles and reflects the importance attached to the studio.
