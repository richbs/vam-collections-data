Possibly a record of a painting seen by Kent during his residence in Italy. Similar sketches occur in Kent's travel diary, kept, during his journey in Northern Italy from June to October 1714, which is now in the Bodelian Library, Oxford. Kent visited Rome in 1715 where he met Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington who became his patron. Boyle encouraged Kent's interest in architecture when they returned to London together and Kent soon started receiving commissions for buildings and furniture in the classical style. His most famous buildings include Holkham Hall, Norfolk, and the Horse Guards, Whitehall.",
