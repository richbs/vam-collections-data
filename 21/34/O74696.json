The tongue and latchets (straps) have small holes, through which to draw a ribbon to tie the shoe, or to fasten with a buckle.  \n\nThe narrow red silk braid decorating this shoe has been used to spectacular effect.  By applying it in rows set closely together, the braid accentuates the elegant, curvilinear shape of the shoe.  The white rand, the narrow band of white kid around the edge of the sole, is characteristic of the late 17th century.\n\nThe shoes are 'straights', that is, each one was made for either the left or the right foot, although the distortion of shoe T.107:A-1917 indicates that it was worn on the right foot.",
