Some were imported from Flanders (now in The Netherlands and Belgium) and other European weaving centres, while those now thought to be English might have been made at the Sheldon workshop. Although based on the design of a Flemish cushion cover (museum no. T.278-1913 in the British Galleries), the na\u00efvet\u00e9 and startling colours of this cushion cover distinguish it as English.\n\nUse\n16th- and early 17th-century houses  were very sparsely furnished by modern standards. Chairs were usually reserved for the master and mistress of the house, and cushions were vital in making benches and stools less uncomfortable. Some were tapestry woven and some embroidered.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nOther English cushion covers with scenes from the Parable of the Prodigal  Son, from the New Testament, survive in private collections, revealing the popularity of the subject, no doubt because of its moral value. The narrative could easily be divided into separate scenes, each  of which could  be used on a separate cushion cover. With such a  well-known story, the scenes could be used on their own or as a  complete set.",
