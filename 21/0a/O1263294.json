The dress comes with a belt made from the same material and features a plastic gold buckle at the front. This buckle is decorative as the belt does up using a series of poppers located at the back of the belt. The dress has a single pleat down the left hand side, from shoulder to hem, featuring a different, spotted pattern but using the same colours. This pleat has four decorative gold buttons sewn onto it, but unlike the buckle, these are made of metal. The collared dress does up using a metal zip, and a hook and eye, located at the back. It also has a lining made of cream, synthetic fabric.",
