Such busts would have been used to display their owners' patriotic support for the monarch.\n\nTime\nGeorge II (reigned 1727-1760) is shown in his later years. This, and the patriotic and victorious elements on the bracket made to accompany the bust, suggest that it was made at a time of victories, such as those of 1757-59 - Clive at Plassey in India; Wolfe at Quebec - during the Seven Years War against France.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe bust was probably copied from one cast in plaster. Such commercially-produced plasters were occasionally used at British porcelain factories as prototypes for production, especially for figures and busts. Some plaster-makers knew that their production lines were being reproduced by the ceramics factories (and they charged them accordingly), but others were on their guard against plagiarists.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe bust is one of a group of sculptural porcelains that have been chemically tested and found to contain soaprock. This mineral was mined under licence in Cornwall. From documents we know that Richard Chaffers (1731-1765) of Liverpool was among those who used it as an ingredient in making porcelain, and he currently seems the most likely manufacturer of the several versions of this bust.",
