Pieces mounted with Japanese lacquer were particularly fashionable, and so strong was the demand that a lively trade in reproductions and even outright fakes soon came into being. This small set of corner shelves (shown on the right of the image) is one of a pair, collected by the London military outfitter, John Jones. Although the other set from the pair was probably made in France in the 1780s, this set was almost certainly made in England between about 1860 and 1880.  The carcase of this piece is in mahogany, whereas the older set is constructed on an oak carcase. The panels of the older piece seem to be partly in Janapese lacquer and partly in a European varnish technique, imitating lacquer (confusingly known as 'japanning'), but on the present piece all the panels are in the European technique, which suggests that Japanese lacquer was no longer readily available.",
