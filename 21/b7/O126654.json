The buckle consists of a D-shaped frame attached by a hinge to a shallow square hollow plate, open at the opposite end.  The edges of the opening are trefoiled on the front and scalloped on the back, with five holes to allow the buckle to be riveted to the end of the belt.  The tongue is made from a strip of sheet silver, broad at the base and folded over to form the point.  The front of the plate is decorated with a winged figure in a wide-brimmed plumed hat holding a sword in one hand, and the head of a bearded man in the other, with a background of applied rings of twisted wire and granules.  The crescent of the frame has the same applied filigree decoration interspersed with sheet silver flowers.\n[Belt-end] Silver-gilt belt end.  The belt end is shaped like a shallow flat tongue-shaped box, open at the top where it would have been fastened to the belt.  There are two holes in the opening for attachment to the belt, and the edges are trimmed decoratively at the front, and scalloped at the back.  On the front is a repousse image of a seated woman with two other figures, with a background of applied rings of twisted wire and granules.  There is an engraved floral design on the back.  At the bottom are three loops, each holding a silver lozenge pendant, gilded on the front.",

They were described as 16th century Norwegian when given to the Museum in 1949.  \n\nMarriage belts of late medieval or renaissance design continued in use with traditional costume in Norway long after they had gone out of fashionable use.  The elements of these traditional marriage belts are often mistaken for their earlier prototypes, but over time they became increasingly standardised, and by the 19th century the design of the buckle usually consisted of a cast angel\u2019s head among scrolls. The allegorical scenes on these pieces and the use of applied filigree circles suggest that they may well be as early as claimed.  Although similar, there are differences of detail between the two parts, and they may not have been made by the same maker, although it is quite probable that they were worn together.",
