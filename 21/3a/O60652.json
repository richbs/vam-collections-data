The top is veneered with padouk and cross-banded with partridge wood. Both these woods were rare and expensive. Padouk came from the Andaman Islands in the Indian Ocean and partridge wood from Brazil. The maker of this table highlighted the veneers with inlay of engraved brass. The fashion for brass-inlaid furniture developed in the 1730s and lasted for only about 25 years. Only a few workshops in London produced furniture with this luxurious form of decoration. But for most pieces there is nothing to identify the maker.\n\nCurrently on loan to Valentines Mansion, Redbridge.",
