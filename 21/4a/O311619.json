They were once thought to be early projects by Filippo della Valle for his altarpiece of the same subject in  Sant'Ignacio, Rome, but their style and handling do not correspond with that of della Valle, and they are composed in the reverse sense to the altarpiece. The handling is strikingly similar to that in a sketch model now in San Francisco (De Young Memorial Museum) for the statue of Pope Alexander VIII by the Genoese sculptor Angelo de' Rossi's, and the relief style compares closely with that of de' Rossi's marble relief on the tomb of Alexander VIII in Saint Peter's Rome.

They were once thought to be early projects by Filippo della Valle for his altarpiece of the same subject in  Sant'Ignacio, Rome, but their style and handling do not correspond with that of della Valle, and they are composed in the reverse sense to the altarpiece. The handling is strikingly similar to that in a sketch model now in San Francisco (De Young Memorial Museum) for the statue of Pope Alexander VIII by the Genoese sculptor Angelo de' Rossi's, and the relief style compares closely with that of de' Rossi's marble relief on the tomb of Alexander VIII in Saint Peter's Rome.
