Hermansen and from 1885 to 1889 attended the Tegne-og Industriskolen for Kvinder (School of Drawing and Industry for Women) in Copenhagen.  In 1888 on the recommendation of August Saabye she was admitted to the Academy, where she studied under Th. Stein and became the first woman sculptor to have passed through the Academy.  In 1894 she was awarded a travelling scholarship, and from that year until 1905 lived mostly in Paris.  here she executed for parisian firms the works in silver decorated with <font -i>japonoiserie</font> ornament and stylised floral sprays of which this bowl is an example.  The floral sprays are typical of Art Nouveau (see 1615-1900).  Later Miss Hoffmann became interested in textiles.  In 1912 she studied the technique of dyeing wollen yarn at Mora in Sweden, and later set up a yarn dyeing establishment at Birkerod, where she died on 26 February 1917.",
