Their name \u2018calabaza\u2019 means gourd, and refers to their shape.  Although the design appears very old, there is no record of earrings of this type before the 18th century, although the little pendant doves hanging from the bottom have been used on jewellery from the region for many centuries.  Unlike other kinds of Spanish jewellery, these gourd-shaped earrings are usually highlighted in red, rather than green.  The red cloth traditionally placed inside them may have been used for perfume, or may simply have been intended to show off the filigree design.\n\nThey were bought in Astorga, \u2018which is at the junction of trains from Leon, and where the Maragatos live\u2019, in 1925, and bequeathed to the V&amp;A at the death of the donor in 1976.",
