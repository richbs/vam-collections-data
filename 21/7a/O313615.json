            "public_access_description": "The Medici were a powerful and influential Florentine family, with great influence in Florence from the 14th to the 18th century. There were three Popes among the family and many rulers of Florence, like of example Lorenzo de'Medici or Lorenzo the Magnificent (1449-1492), who was patron of some of the most important artists of the Renaissance.\n\nCosimo I de\u2019 Medici (b.  1519-d. 1574) was Grand Duke of Florence from \n1569\u201374. He was the nephew of  Ottaviano de\u2019 Medici. His mother, Maria Salviati (d. 1543), was a granddaughter of  Lorenzo the Magnificent and his father, the professional soldier Giovanni delle Bande Nere (1498\u20131526), was killed when Cosimo was seven. When, in 1537, Lorenzino de\u2019 Medici murdered Alessandro de\u2019 Medici, the tyrannical Duke of Florence, Cosimo was the only available successor. Initially his power was limited, but he became Duke of Florence in 1537, after his victory at the Battle of Montemurlo, and Grand Duke of Tuscany in 1569.\n\nDespite the many portraits of Alessandro de' Medici his African heritage is rarely mentioned. He was born in 1510 to an African servant to the Medici household (referred to as Simonetta da Collavechio). Historians are without doubt that he was fathered by the 17 year old Cardinal Giulio de Medici, nephew of Lorenzo the Magnificent and later to become Pope Clement VII.\nHe was thus the first black head of state in the modern western world.\n\nHe is one of the two Medici princes buried in the famous Medici tomb of Michelangelo.",
