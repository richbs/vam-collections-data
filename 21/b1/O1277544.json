It was given to Carrington by a fan of his work.\n\nThe Fourth Wall, also known as The Perfect Alibi, is a detective drama by the author A.A.Milne. It was also adapted as film in 1930 under the title Birds of Prey. The play was first staged at the Haymarket Theatre in 1928 but Carrington performed in a production which opened at the King's Theatre in June of 1929. The entire action of the play takes in a room with three walls, 'the fourth wall' being that through which the audience witnesses the crime. Carrington performed the role of Edward Carter, one of the men who planned the murder.",
