Small, portable hand drums (tsutsumi), such as this piece, were utilised by musicians, seated at the back of the stage, to direct and maintain the rhythm of a play. In Noh theatre the poetic text would be chanted with the drum beats heightening a stylised performance of dance, songs and mime. This small group of drummers would also be accompanied by a flutist creating a sound that was both refined and at times dramatic.\n\nThis drum's simplistic design in plain wood contrasts with the grander pieces of the Edo period (1615-1868) which were decorated with colourful lacquer compositions (as exemplified by the piece FE.126-2002). By the Edo period Noh theatre had transformed into a traditional ritual reserved for the entertainment of the upper elite. This drum's lack of decoration may have been due to its fine wooden patina and simple, uncomplicated form, all qualities that could have been deemed suitable for a ritualistic performance.",
