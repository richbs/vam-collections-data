Each loom width comprises one band of the background colour. The damask was always thought to be Chinese and the bedcover was purchased on this basis.  However, it now seems likely to be European (perhaps northern European) because the technical features of the damask seem to mark it out as such.  The key to understanding why it was originally thought to be Chinese is in a seminal article by George Wingfield Digby in The Burlington Magazine, LXXVII, 1940, 52-63 and the reason why there are now doubts as to its Chinese provenance lie in the textile analysis work of Milton Sonday, see his article in the Abegg Foundation publication, Riggisberger Berichte, volume 7, ' Linen Damasks: Centres of Production and Collections'. On present evidence, the damask seems to be seventeenth century or later and the lining, passementerie and tassles, twentieth-century.",
