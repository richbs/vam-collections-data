The design is not signed or dated but was probably created by Comelli in circa 1912. It shows a full length image of a woman in a blue and white dress. The dress is white pattern with small blue scallops lines and is worn under a white apron (which is gathered up around her hips) and a tight, front lacing blue bodice. She wears a white scarf around the top of her shoulders and this fastens in a bow at the centre of her bodice. She is also wearing a wide brimmed hat, the brim outlined in a thick band of blue and the lining white with blue spots. The long blue ribbon attached to the centre of the hat hangs down over her shoulders.",
