The workshops employed young artists to produce decorative objects for the home between 1913 and 1919. Influenced by French Post-Impressionist painting such as Fauvism and Cubism, the workshops produced printed and woven textiles, ceramics and painted furniture. Some of the objects were made by the artists, themselves while other designs were handed over to skilled craftsmen.\n\nIt is likely that this tray was made by the cabinet-maker Joseph Kallenborn. He was also responsible for turning Henri Gaudier-Brzeska's design of two wrestlers into a tray (Museum no. W.30-1978). Duncan Grant grew up in Burma and probably drew inspiration from his time there when he designed the woman riding a small elephant depicted on this tray. The tray proved popular and was copied several times. One version was bought by the playwright George Bernard Shaw, who had invested money in the workshops.",
