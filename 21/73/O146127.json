The decorative centre is delineated by a line of adjoining white circles.  There are two vertical lines of lobed compartments, each 22 cm wide; there are 4 compartments per line and they are linked vertically by a narrow white and blue oval line.  The floral decoration within each compartment is dominated by a pair of green horizontal scrolling frames and by dark red stems and a pair of vertical green V-shapes.\nThe spaces between these compartments ie. a central vertical line and a half line down both sides, are filled with floral motifs on dark red stems.  Vertical dark red stems echo the V-shapes previously mentioned and green scrolling lines edged with white circles echo elements from the compartments.\nThere is a seam across the lower edge 5.5 cm from the bottom.  The embroidery was worked over it.\nEmbroidery threads: 2S silk; very dark red, red, dark pink, pink, dark yellow, yellow, purple, blue, light blue, white, black, dark orange.\nInset wool: red, orange, dark blue, purple, dark pink, turquoise, white, dark green.\nSome black under drawing or printing is visible.\n\nSee also: 846-1877 for identical design and 842-1877 for similar piece.",
