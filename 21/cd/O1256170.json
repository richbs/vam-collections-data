The background is plain black. The style is quite loose over the surface of the fabric, with impasto used to pick up highlights on the lace on the hat and around her neck. The face is painted with smaller brush strokes, with subtle highlights in the eyes and on the nose.\nThe support is canvas, across a dark wood stretcher with keys placed in each corner. The glass and gold-coloured frame are much later than the painting, which is seen through an oval aperture in a dark brown mount.",
