            "public_access_description": "This scene depicts two women harvesting grapes. On their right, a figure seated under a vine arbour is playing the lute. Other figures can be seen in the background next to a farm building in front of a range of hills merging with the blue sky. This simple composition does not resemble one exact model, though the seated figure with a lute is taken from the figure of Orpheus in Poussin's Landscape with Orpheus and Eurydice in the Louvre.\n\nSeveral characteristics of the mosaic are typical of works created in the early 19th century. The sky is composed of square-shaped tesserae that have the comparatively large size of 0.5 by 0.5 millimetres. In addition, there is no graduation whatsoever in the blue of the sky; it is separated from the blue hills with a zone of white tesserae. The interstices are comparatively small and have generally been left white. Only where skin is depicted is the grout coloured in, and at times is closer to the natural colour than the actual, slightly greyish tesserae.\n\nMany comparable micromosaic plaques were also mounted in gold boxes that were made during the first and second decades of the 19th century. One other example in the Gilbert Collection is particularly comparable in subject-matter and technical characteristics. This other plaque is mounted in a gold box bearing Prague hallmarks for 1807, which gives us a terminus ante quem for its creation that can also a guideline for dating the mosaic of this piece.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes. Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",

The first micromosaics were created in the 18th century, but it was not until Arthur Gilbert himself became interested in collecting them and invented the term 'micromosaics' that they became known as such. The tesserae are minute pieces cut from thin pieces of glass known as smalti filati, and some of the finest micomosaics can consist of as many as 5,000 tesserae per square inch (ca. 3 by 3cm). By the late 18th century Rome had become central to the production of micromosaics and sold them as souvenirs to wealthy foreigners visiting the city. From small elegant snuffboxes to large monumental tabletops, micromosaics could be used to decorate objects of all shapes and sizes. They could even be made to resemble full-sized canvas paintings, and indeed Arthur Gilbert himself mistook his very first micromosaic for a painting. When he brought it home to show his wife, he had to convince her that it was not in fact a cracked painting, as she supposed, but a mosaic.",
