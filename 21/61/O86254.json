ISBN 1851773088.\nDecorated with the cypher of King Henri II and the arms of France, this elaborate candlestick is one of about seventy surviving pieces in a mannerist style characteristic of French court fashion around 1550. Although known as Saint-Porchaire ware, these pieces were manufactured probably in or near Paris rather than at the village of Saint-Porchaire. The way in which they combine different components in several tiers is more typical of contemporaneous metalwork and architectural design than of pottery. By 1842 these pieces were described as \"fa\u00efence de Henri II\" because the emblems of the French king and his wife, Catherine de' Medici, together with those, as was then thought, of his mistress Diane de Poitiers, appear on more than one example. Because of its presumed royal connection, its style, its technical complexity, and its rarity, Saint-Porchaire ware became the type of ceramic most sought after by collectors, along with so-called Medici porcelain (see cat. 75). The prominence given to it at South Kensington enhanced its reputation still further.\n\tFrom the late 1860s onward the Saint-Porchaire ware was displayed in a special case in the Ceramics Gallery. The name of Fran\u00e7ois Charpentier of Orion, at that time thought to be the maker, was included among the ten most important potters whose names appeared on the ceramic columns made by Minton & Co. that lined the gallery. Several nineteenth-century manufacturers, notably Minton, produced copies of Saint-Porchaire ware. In 1871 Minton & Co. of Stoke-on-Trent showed a candlestick modelled on this piece at the international exhibition in London.\n\nLit.

However, the chemical composition of the clay rendered it extremely vulnerable during firing, which resulted in the need for small-scale decoration. Such labour-intensive and exquisite work was available only to the most wealthy patrons. Although a certain amount of mystery surrounds the origin of these pieces, it is thought they would have had a market in only the most noble and courtly circles; an association confirmed by the armorial device of Henri II on this candlestick. This  suggests that Paris, and possibly the atelier of Bernard Palissy, was their most likely source, not the village of Saint-Porchaire.",
