In the Syrian region, which incorporated much of Palestine, Jordan and Lebanon as well as Syria itself in the 19th century, they were worn by all sections of society, from townswomen to the nomadic Bedouin of the desert.  The designs vary by sector and show influences from a wide area, reflecting Syria\u2019s strong trading traditions and central location.\n\nHinged bracelets, like this one, were more common among the settled urban and rural population.  The use of a red and green piece of glass and applied rings of twisted wire are both characteristic of Syrian traditional jewellery.\n\nThis bracelet was described as from the Lebanon when it was acquired by the Museum in 1873.",
