            "public_access_description": "This altarpiece is by Andrea Della Robbia, made in Florence in the early 16th century.\n\nThe composition is related to that of a number of Umbrian paintings of the Adoration of the Magi, of which the most important is an altarpiece by Perugino in the Pinacoteca Nazionale at Perugia (about 1475). The arms are those of Albizzi, and the altarpiece may have been commissioned for S Michele or S Andrea at Rovezzano, both of which were under Albizzi patronage at the end of the 15th century.\n\nThe Della Robbia family was an Italian family of sculptors and potters. They were active in Florence from the early 15th century and elsewhere in Italy and France well into the 16th. Family members were traditionally employed in the textile industry, and their name derives from rubia tinctorum, a red dye. \nLuca della Robbia founded the family sculpture workshop in Florence and was regarded by contemporaries as a leading artistic innovator, comparable to Donatello and Masaccio. The influence of antique art and his characteristic liveliness and charm are evident in such works as the marble singing-gallery for Florence Cathedral. He is credited with the invention of the tin-glazed terracotta sculpture for which the family became well known. \nHis nephew Andrea della Robbia, who inherited the workshop, tended to use more complex compositions and polychrome glazing rather than the simple blue-and-white schemes favoured by his uncle.",
