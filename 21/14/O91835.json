This chalice would have been originally accompanied by a paten (dish) for the consecrated bread. According to Catholic belief the wine and bread are miraculously transformed into the blood and body of Christ during the Mass. The bowls of silver chalices are usually gilded inside, to emphasize the precious nature of their contents and to protect the metal. This late medieval example is decorated with depictions of St John the Baptist, St James, the instruments of the Passion (tools associated with Christ's Crucifixion), and heraldic insignia.\n\nBefore coming to the Museum this chalice was in the private collection of J.C. Robinson, the first curator of art at the V&A, who shifted the focus of the Museum collections away from its original enthusiasm for good examples of modern design, towards historic works of art which should inspire modern manufactures. In his 15 years at the Museum, Robinson created the first public collection of medieval and Renaissance decorative art in Britain.",
