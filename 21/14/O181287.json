This pen and ink drawing by Pilotell illustrates several leading actors in the original production of Gillbert and Sullivan's comic opera The Mikado which opened at London's Savoy Theatre in March 1885. The fan-like shapes which act as frames for each vignette echo the Japanese theme of the opera, and the costumes worn by the characters are those designed by Wilhelm for the original production.\n\nPilotell was a French artist living in London who was probably a personal contact of Richard D'Oyly Carte. His artwork appears in various printed items relating to Gilbert and Sullivan operas produced by D'Oyly Carte, including an April 1878 programme printed during the original run of 'The Sorcerer when it was produced with a revival of Trial By Jury at London's Opera Comique, April 1878.",
