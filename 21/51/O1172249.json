Originally from Turkey, she works with film, photography and print to explore what she describes as \"the bewildering experience of displacement.\"  She also engages with the potential of pattern and motif within Islamic art, and likes to use as her settings lavish or dramatic architectural spaces, which offer cover or exposure, and allude to the theatrical. She aims for a disruptive blurring of cultural perceptions. The idea of 'the veil' is a core theme in her practice and is explored through performance and site-responsive activities that merge Eastern and Western sensibilities.\n\nThis print is one of a series she made after filming and photographing the Grand Staircase in the Henry Cole Wing at the V&A. In each image a female figures, veiled in brightly coloured and voluminous layers of fabric is seen descending the stairs or processing along a landing, as part of a mysterious unexplained narrative or performance.",
