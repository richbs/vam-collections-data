This roundel depicts The Oath of the Victors, De Bours, De Roeck and De Liedekerke. Between 4\u20136 November 1576 mercenaries in the Spanish service launched a full-scale attack on Antwerp (see inv.no. A.38-1975). Over 2500 citizens were murdered and 100 houses burned down, including the magnificent Town Hall. In August 1577, however, the Netherlandish coalition overthrew the Spanish troops in the Citadel, as depicted in the medal A.34-1975. They then negotiated with the German mercenaries to withdraw (see inv.no. A.36-1975).\nFive of the compositions are derived from a set of seven engravings by the Wierix brothers, after designs by Marten de Vos. That showing the Spanish Fury, a separate event, has no direct prototype and is unique. The translation of the engravings into low-reliefs is highly competent and bespeaks the hand of a master, as does their technical excellence. The minuteness of detail and the style of the figures points towards the medallist and bronze-sculptor, Jacques Jongheling, who was Master at the Mint at that time.\nJongheling worked in the Mannerist style that was common to all media in Antwerp in the last third of the sixteenth century.",
