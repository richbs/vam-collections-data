The coloured drawing acts as a foundation. When the acetate film is laid on top of the foundation drawing then the figures look complete.  The Czechoslovakian, Jacqueline Groag, emigrated to England where she worked as a textile designer.  Her use of outline drawings on acetate film over a coloured drawing as a foundation creates a layered effect in this design for a printed textile. The layers simulate textile printing using a sequence of  impressions.  There is a similar design for a textile entitled  'Dolls Galore' which is in the collection at the Victoria and Albert Museum.",
