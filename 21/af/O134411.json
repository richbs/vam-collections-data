A woman in coat and hat, with flower motif, is shaking her hand, smiling adoringly; and a love heart metaphorically rises up from her. A man in coat and cap stands next to her smiling . A little girl, also smiling, and wearing a coat and striped scarf hands a bouquet of flowers to Prince Charles. She has a bow in her hair. Prince Charles wears a suit jacket, with Prince of Wales feathers attached to the lapel, a shirt and tie, and a kilt. Behind the group are trees.\n\nSome lines have been blocked out with liquid paper, and faint underdrawing can be seen.",

As she describes it: 'This cartoon was an irreverent take on Camilla's first walkabout following her marriage to Prince Charles. Pictures of the walkabout appeared \u2013 with her remarkable hat \u2013 on all the front pages this morning. She seemed less than enthusiastic, although the tone on Fleet Street was generally respectful.'\n\n'Marf' drew daily topical cartoons for the Evening Standard between March 2002 and August 2005, moving to the Londoner's Diary page in August 2003. The drawings cover key political and social issues of the period, providing a vivid and often hilarious response to the main news of the day. The Evening Standard is London's only evening newspaper, publishing up to five editions a day. In Marf's own words: 'The cartoonist needs to keep up with the rapid pace of event.'",
