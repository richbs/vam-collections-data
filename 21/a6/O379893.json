They originally kept them in place with laces, but by the 19th century they had switched to silver chains.  They wore these in pairs, one on each side of the body.  These chains linked the lower outside corners of the collar, at the front and back, by passing under the arm.  At each end there was a decorative hook, which was attached to the corners of the collar, and a filigree pendant like this, called a Gollermasche, was used to weigh the collar down.\n\nThis was described as 17th century when it was acquired in 1926, but there is no evidence that pendants of this kind were worn that early in Germany.  Traditional jewellery was often mistaken for older work, because of its archaic appearance.",
