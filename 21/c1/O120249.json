            "public_access_description": "Stars of the 19th century theatre were often celebrated in paintings, prints and drawings, and in ceramic figurines. Several Staffordshire factories specialised in moulded earthenware portrait figurines which were decorated by hand and sold cheaply. This represents Charlotte Vandenhoff (1818-1860) and is based on an engraving published in Tallis's Shakespeare Gallery, 1852-1853, entitled 'Miss Vandenhoff as Juliet' with a quote from Act 3, scene ii.  The pose is not exact, since the left hand is held across her chest and in the engraving it is outstretched, but this is a modification that a potter might make. At least seven earthenware portrait figurines are known to have been copied from this source and are known as Tallis figures.  They were made in many sizes, probably by by the Burslem potters Thomas Parr (who was working from 1852 until 1870), John Parr, (working from 1870 to 1879), or the Kent & Parr firm, (working from1880 until 1894). These manufacturers passed the moulds to each other and the figures were produced throughout the Victorian period.\n\nThe Liverpool-born actress Charlotte Vandenhoff, the daughter of the actor John Vandenhoff,  made her first appearance on stage as Juliet at Drury Lane in 1836. She played the role again at Covent Garden in 1840 and also in the provinces and America where she performed in 1839 and 1858.",
