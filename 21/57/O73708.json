            "physical_description": "A stand for basin and towels, consisting of six circular-section legs arranged as the points of a hexagon. These are linked by two sets of interlocking stretchers at the foot, and at 61.5 cm, forming a platform for a wash basin. \n\nThe main frame is decorated with two phoenix head finials, one at either side of the top rail. Carved open work spandrels of naturalistic form are attached on either side of the main frame and a four piece carved open work frame on the inside to create a square border, between the two horizontal stretchers, the uppermost of which forms the towel rail. The front four legs terminate in carvings of lotus buds. \n\nThe stand is made of huali wood. It is a hard wood that is naturally rich in colour. This piece of furniture has been stained and polished.\n\nThe main frame of the structure is formed by two vertical members, carved into a circular section form, which run the full height of the stand functioning as the two back legs and the vertical side sections of the towel rail. \n\nThese vertical members are linked horizontally by one flat bar, and two circular section stretchers, and by the horizontal circular section top rail. They are all joined to the vertical members using blind mortise and tenon joints. This gives three rectangular openings. The bottom one contains a one-piece curvilinear apron with beaded edge. The central one contains a four-piece frame in openwork carving of archaistic style. The top one contains a three-piece curvilinear apron with beaded edge, and is flanked by spandrels of carved openwork in the style of foliage. These are held in place with small pegs which feed into corresponding holes on the vertical members. The top rail terminates in phoenix-headed finials, curved inwards to confront each other. \n\nEach of the circular section legs is hand carved rather than turned on a lathe. The use of a lathe to make circular section components was common practice in the furniture making traditions of many other countries at this time, but hand carving was the preferred technique in China.\n\nThe platform on which the wash basin stands is formed by six interlocking stretchers, each joined to a leg using a blind mortise and tenon joint. The same structure is repeated at the foot of the structure giving two sets of interlocking stretchers at different heights. \n\nWood pins are visible where the upper interlocking stretchers meets the vertical members of the main frame. There is evidence of minor repair and fills in this area and other small areas on the legs.",
