(8 \u00be x 11 1/8 ins.), which was used by the artist on his summer visit to George Constable at Arundel concurrently with the intact sketch-book No. 382 [316-1888], and again when he went to Worcester to lecture in October. For the reasons given in the entries on those drawings, Nos. 378 [272-1888], 379 [260-1888] and 384 [836-1888] are probably from the same book. Holmes, p. 252, notes in the Sir J. C. Robinson sale of 21 April 1902 a drawing 'Landscape with Cottages' dated 15 July 1835 and measuring 8 \u00be x 11 ins. This was made during the visit to Arundel and may have been from the same sketch-book.\u201d",
