The junction of the neck and body was decorated with a band of palm leaves:  to the incurving neck are applied eight rosettes.  The rim, which overhangs, is decorated with ribbing.  The spout terminates in a lion's head, resembling that of the hot eater urn (M.3-c,-1973) and is decorated at the foot and beneath the lion head with palm leaves in relief.  The ebony handle fits at the top into a socket composed of an anthemion (above) and a palm leaf (below) rising from a circle of palm leaves and curving outwards into a rosette.  At the bottomit fits into a socket of palm leaf and acanthus.  The base is encircled round the neck with a rope girdle:  its moulded edge is decorated with palm leaves.  The flat lid, with two bayonet clips, is topped by a moulded ebony knob.",
