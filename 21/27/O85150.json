The first full band from the bottom has a large ragged yellow blossom in the centre with a floral palmette within; to either side an indented lozenge-shaped blossom and within a red rosette lying diagonally and from its 2 points extend pairs of pink lilies. The second band has at the centre a dark green blossom and within a red rosette and outside a white frill. On either side lies a larger yellow indented blossom enclosing a large dark green rosette. These 2 bands are repeated upwards and create 3 rows of large floral emblems of similar shapes and outlines but with different colours. The whole field is heavily filled with blossoms. Along both sides are diagonal items with outward facing buds and also with animal and tiny floral motifs which appear in other places on the field.\nMain border: red ground with a white angular meander linking elaborate blossoms that are basically either rosettes or palmettes. From the palmettes extend a pair of green or blue lilies.On the white stem between the blossoms is a pronounced arrowhead and beside it is a large bud, usually red.\nInner and Outer border: white ground with double meander in red and dark brown linking small flowers in these colours.",
