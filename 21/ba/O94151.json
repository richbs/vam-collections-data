This extensive series is made up of small and subtle black and white photographs showing the construction of new housing in the American West.  Int he 1970s, Lewis Baltz's photography was linked to other contemporary photographers working in America such as Robert Adams for their redefining of American landscape photography, often labelled as the New Topographics photographers.  On onelevel, it is clear from Park City that Baltz's photographs deal directly with the impact of urbanisation and commodification on a landscape as well as being able to find forms of great visual intrigue in the construction sites.",
