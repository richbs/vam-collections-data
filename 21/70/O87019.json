The Bedford Master took his name from two outstanding manuscripts made for John of Lancaster, Duke of Bedford and brother of Henry V, victor at Agincourt in 1415. The Bedford Master's style was widely practised in Paris. The Dunois Master appears to have adopted most closely the painting style and models of the Bedford Master. \n\nThe miniature on the leaf shows scenes from the life of St Giles, who was born in Athens but made his way to Rome before retiring into a forest between Arles and N\u00eemes in southern France. St Giles lived there as a hermit, surviving on milk from a tame doe. One day the king wounded both the deer and St Giles while he was out hunting. In repentence for this action, he built a monastery of which Giles became the abbot. This is the famous monastery of St Gilles, near Arles, which was to become an important place of pilgrimage in the Middle Ages.",
