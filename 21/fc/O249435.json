The vase is of a calyx-crater form and similar in design to the Medici Vase, but with the body decorated with acanthus scrolls. It is placed on a well-head decorated in relief with figures of the twelves gods.\n\nChambers moved to London in 1755 and published his influential Treatise on Civil Architecture in 1759.  Chambers demonstrated the breadth of his style in buildings such as Gower (later Carrington) House and Melbourne House, London, in such country houses as Duddingston, Scotland, and in the garden architecture he designed for Wilton House, Wiltshire, and at Kew Gardens. He became head of government building in 1782, and in this capacity built Somerset House, London.",
