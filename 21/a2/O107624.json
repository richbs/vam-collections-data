The goldsmith has soldered together (fused using molten silver) pieces of raised (hammered) sheet silver, then gilded elements such as the hem of her dress, her hair and crown. Seams can be seen down the centre of the back, down the back of the arm holding the infant and down the front of the drapery. \n\nThe Virgin is crowned in reference to her role in much Christian imagery as the Queen of Heaven. Veneration of the Holy Mother has always been a central part of Catholic worship and was particularly encouraged by the Roman Catholic Church after the Counter Reformation from the mid 16th century.",

Internal dissent was undermining its authority and whole nations were going over to the new Protestant faiths. To clarify its role, the church held the Council of Trent from 1545 to 1563. It addressed concerns about religious education, abuses of wealth and the relief of the poor. The Society of Jesus (the Jesuits) became the champion of the reformed Catholic church and promoted the faith worldwide. At the heart of this Counter Reformation was the need to restore the Eucharist to the centre of worship. In Catholic belief, the Eucharist enshrines the moment when bread and wine, consecrated at the altar, are transformed into the body and blood of Christ. A priest holding up a monstrance Detail from The Adoration of the Holy Eucharist, by Claudio Coello, 1685-90 Monasterio del Escorial, Madrid.\n\nArt and Faith \nThe image and message of the reinvigorated Roman Catholic church were actively promoted through dramatic architecture and furnishings. Throughout the 17th century new churches were built in the grand Baroque style. Their sumptuous interiors were complemented by elaborate monstrances, candelabra, sanctuary lamps and censers. Awe-inspiring altar silver drew the eyes of the faithful towards the Eucharist.",
