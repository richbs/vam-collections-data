There would only be one or two of these chairs in the house; other household members would sit on benches, stools or simpler chairs. This chair is made entirely of oak, with decoration in the form of relief carving and turning.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe construction of the chair is extremely robust. Oak is a strong and hard-wearing wood native to Britain. The chair frame is constructed with strong mortise and tenon joints and the plain panels of the chair back are held within a sturdy frame. The legs are connected and strengthened by rectangular stretchers.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe plain outline is enlivened by simple features such as the rounded front legs, which were turned on a lathe before construction. The top rail of the chair-back is ornamented with shallow relief carving  of stylised flowers within circles and diamond shapes. The arms have a slight downward sweep for comfort.",
