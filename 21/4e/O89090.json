This design may have been inspired by Henri de Toulouse Lautrec's famous 1899 lithographic poster of the dancer Jane Avril wearing a black and red dress with a vibrant snake coiling around it in much the same manner as the snake coils round this design. However, the silhouette and cut of Stiebel's dress, a simple tubular line with an assymetrical hem and wide shoulder straps, are thoroughly up to date for 1927. The woman as portrayed appears to represent a popular archetype of the period, the \"vamp\" or \"femme fatale\", a predatory, sexually confident woman with heavy make-up and jewelry and a sharply cut hairstyle.\n\n- Daniel Milford-Cottam, February 2012",
