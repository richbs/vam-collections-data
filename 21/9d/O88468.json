Thence forward, it is easier to date accurately and positively attribute national origins by comparison with fully marked silver examples. Technical improvements in the casting of both base and precious metal candlesticks also substantially altered their form.\n\nThroughout the 18th century the most popular method of production was to cast the entire socket, stem and base in two halves and solder the two together.  On brass candlesticks which have been vigorously cleaned the two stems running vertically down the \u2018stick\u2019 can be seen quite distinctly.  This construction method made possible elaborately stepped bases and octagonal faceted stems. By the middle of the century, the base had been simplified;  it was often octagonal with a depressed centr, but now the corners were concave and the stem of tall proportions.",
