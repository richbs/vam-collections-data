In the middle we see Buddha standing in the centre slightly towards the monk  on the right.  On the other side there is Vajrapani, the Buddha's faithful body guard, seen from the rear.  The Buddha is completely wrapped up in his sanghati which encases his body in folds.  The face is mostly broken off but his usnisa is just visible.  The monk is shown with anjalimudra pointing to the Buddha.   Vajrapani, seen from the rear, forms a bold figure matching that of the monk on the left.  His right hand is raised to his chest  holding the thunderbolt.  A large part of this is broken off.   On the two lateral units appear two tree nymphs (yaksinis), in perfectly identical postures as if mirrored, with the exception of the posture of the heads.",
