            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of British Oil Paintings 1820-1860</i>, Ronald Parkinson, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1990, p. 304-5\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"WITHERINGTON, William Frederick, RA (17851865) \nBorn London 26 May 1785. Entered RA Schools 1805. Exhibited 138 works at the RA between 1811 and 1863, 62 at the BI 1808-65, and one at the SBA in 1831; also at the Birmingham Society of Artists. Elected ARA 1830, RA 1840, and Honorary retired Academician 1863. Early works mainly landscapes, then genre; influenced by the work of Morland and Wheatley. Died London 10 April 1865. \nLIT: \tThe Times 15 April 1865 (obit); Athenaeum 22 April 1865, p55 (obit); Art Joumal1865, p191 (obit) \n\nThe Hop Garland FA233 Neg 69196 \nPanel, 43.2 X 33.7 cm (17 X 131/4 ins) Signed and dated 'Witherington/1834' bl \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \nProbably the painting of the same title exhibited at the BI in 1835, the size given in the catalogue as 28 by 24 inches, presumably including the frame. One of his best known works, its subject seems to have appealed greatly to the artist. Another version, differing in details and with the younger girl turned more towards the spectator, is in the Tate Gallery (from the 1847 Vernon Gift, also panel, 44.5 X 35.1 cm/17 \u00bd X 13 ? ins); it was engraved by H Bourne for the Art Journal in 1851 (facing p7). The Art Journal (1859, p74) discussed a third version, painted for Mr Wells of Redleaf and exhibited in 1843 at the RA, different in composition from the Tate painting which does not seem to have been exhibited; that version appeared in the Wells sale at Christie's 27 April 1860 as 'Hop-pickers' and was sold to Agnew for \u00a3117 12s. A version was also recorded in a London private collection some 30 years ago. What appears to be a similar subject, 'The Hop Garden', was exhibited at the RA in 1828 (274) and again at the BI in 1829 (see the Gentleman's Magazine 98, 1828, part 1, pp539-40, and 99, 1829, part 1, p155). The matter is confused by the fact that the present work was received under the title 'The Hop Garden'. \nThe 1851 Art Journal commented on the annual phenomenon of hop-picking in Kent and Sussex, which presented 'features of picturesque attraction which are nowhere else to be met with ... to this country what the vineyards are to the southern districts of France'. \nAt the proper season, men, women, and children are employed in picking the hops, and preparing them for the market. Mr Witherington has selected for his picture [that is, the Tate version] a little episode in the day's work, when the younger labourers are resting awhile from their tasks: a girl, who, from her superior style of dress, we should rather suppose to be a visitor to the garden than a 'picker', is decorating a younger child with a chaplet of the golden flowers. The idea is excellent; so also is the manner in which it has been carried out. The faces of the group are highly expressive, especially that of the little girl, so full of self-complacency at the honours bestowed upon her ... this group, in all its parts, is admirably painted, and finished with great care; it is brilliantly coloured, yet with perfect harmony of tones ... the picture is unquestionably one of the best ever painted by Mr Witherington ... \nAn unidentified newspaper cutting is stuck on the back of the painting, and reads as follows: \n51. [which was the catalogue number at the 1835 BI exhibition] The Hop Garland ... This ingenious artist has contributed three pieces - a vigour beyond his usual law, for not painting more than he does is his single and singular fault. The complaint is so rare, that what the public regret he may justly consider as a compliment. The Hop Garden presents an incident true to nature, in a little girl standing full of pride and delight, while an older one is decking her head with a crown of hops, and a lad sits in his basket laughing at the sport. The expression of the child's face is not quite so pretty or rustically joyous as we could have wished, but it is arch and good. The boy and his drapery are perfect, both in the painting and character; the back-ground is well managed and the whole rich in harmony of colour and truth of effect. \nThe sitter for one of the girls was identified some years ago by a descendant as her great-grandmother, either Mrs Sarah Ancketill or Lady Selina Ker. \nA watercolour by Witherington of a similar subject but different composition, 'A Hop-Garden', is also in the V&A collections (328-1895); another was in the W H Behrens collection, reproduced in colour in the Connoisseur 70, 1924, p107. \nThere are several paintings of the subject recorded by other artists, for example Charles Landseer's 'Girl in a Hop Garden' exhibited at the RA in 1850. \nEXH: ?BI 1835 (51) \nLIT: \tArt Journal 1851, p7, 1859, p74; C Collins Baker British Painting 1933, repr pl 161; G Reynolds Painters of the Victorian Scene 1953, p5n, repr fig 7 \n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
