He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1876, displaying two works, <i>Woodcock Shooting</i> and<i> A Passing Shower</i>. He exhibited four times at the Royal Academy, in 1876, 1878, 1880 and 1885. In 1876 he was recorded as living in Gracechurch Street in London and by 1885 he was residing in Epping, Essex. <i>Still Waters</i> (titled <i>Still Water</i> in the Royal Academy catalogue) was exhibited in 1880 along with <i>The Cover Side </i>and <i>An Essex Waste</i>. For this work Trappes collaborated with Basil Bradley who executed the figures.  It is known that the pair worked together on more than one occasion and Bradley also supplied the figures for the hunting scene titled <i>The Cover Side</i>. Trappes\u2019 technique is meticulous and he appears to have revelled in the subject of <i>Still Waters</i>, the mirror like surface of which affords him an added opportunity to display his artistic dexterity in depicting foliage and hue.",
