The films captured their imagination and paved the way for the merchandising that accompanies many films today. A whole host of toy figures, spacecrafts and toy guns were available, as well as costumes, stationery, bedroom accessories and slippers.\n\nThe electronic CommTalk reader is used as an additional object to the Star Wars figures, which come with a talk chip to connect with this particular device in order to make the figures talk. These were all made for Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace, released in May 1999.",
