They were often hung at the side of the fireplace or rested on the mantlepiece above. Free standing fire screens or pole screens were also used. \n\nThis screen, with its turned handle, would probably have been acquired readymade as would the gilt paper decoration. However the painted scene, fixed to the centre, may well have been made by the maker of this screen, probably an amateur artist. 'Cage' handwork of this type was very popular in the 1820s and 1830s where the paper was hand painted and then the 'cage' painstakingly cut to reveal another image when the central thread was lifted.",
