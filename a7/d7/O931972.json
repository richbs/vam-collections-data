London: Published by Trustees of the Victoria and Albert Museum, 1987.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n\"Claude DU BOSC (worked first half of the 18th century)\nafter Pieter Andreas RYSBRACK (1690-1748)\nA prospect of the Cascade and part of Lord BURLINGTON's House at CHISWICK. From a set of four.\nLettered with the title and <i>Rysbrack pinx, retouch\u00e9 par Chatelain 1748/ C. Du Bosc fecit\n</i>43 X 66.7cm\nEtching and engraving coloured by hand.\nE.1643-1889\n\nPieter Andreas Rysbrack, brother of the sculptor Michael, was a painter in oils of topographical landscapes, and still lifes of fish and game.  The engraver Du Bosc came to Britain from France to assist Nicholas Dorigny with engraving the Raphael Cartoons.  This set of four prints, all hand-coloured, depict features of one of the most important gardens in the history of garden design in Britain, surrounding one of England's most important Palladian buildings.  They are based on four paintings from a set of eight of c. 1730, formerly in the Paston Bedingfield collection at Oxburgh Hall.<sup>1</sup>\nThe painting<sup>2</sup> corresponding to this print differs from it in a number of ways.<sup>3</sup>  William Kent's cascade, a prominent feature in the print was not completed until 1738, and had not therefore been built at the time the painting was done.\nIn each of the four prints opaque colours have been used for the sky, as if intended to obliterate the net of lines the engraver was obliged to use to suggest clouds.  In other areas, more transparent colours allowing the design underneath to show through, have been used.  This use of opaque colours in the sky only, occurs frequently in hand-coloured British topographical prints until the last few decades of the eighteenth century, when colouring methods came to rely increasingly on the transparent colours of watercolour painting.  In <i>The</i> <i>Art of Drawing and Painting in Watercolours</i>, 1731<sup>4</sup> the anonymous author asserts:\n'While I am speaking of white for illuminating of Prints, as I have already observ'd, that the clear white of the Paper is proper to be left uncolour'd;'\nIn the National Art Library's copy of this work a past owner who, judging from references to other works on paintings was writing in c.1760, annotated this passage with the comment:\n'This is not the most masterly manner.  The best way to give the print the air of a painting is to load the light parts with a good body of colour, but this requires a hand of great judgement and of abilities equal to a superior kind of painting.'\nNot only are the signs of oxidisation of the white pigment in the sky visible before conservation but also the very crudeness of the colouring seems to be in favour of the view that the colouring is contemporary with the print.  The catalogues of early- and mid-eighteenth century print publishers show that views of the houses and gardens of the nobility, offers plain or hand-coloured, made up a significant part of their stock.  Interestingly, the impressions of this set of prints in King George III's Topographical Collection in the Map Room at the British Library are uncoloured, as are the majority of similar prints in that collection.\n\n1.
