They were both interested in the dress reform movement and conceived the dress in accordance with the movement's principles so it did not restrict the waist and arms.  \n\nIt fits a natural, uncorsetted figure and is cut fairly full, with smocking at the back and front. The sleeves are elbow-length puffs, smocked and gathered, to reflect historical styles. The skirts consist of an overskirt, draped with tapes and gathered up, and an underskirt, mounted on a white cotton lining and tied back.\n\nThe sewing is not professional and the dress has been altered.  The Liberty's material is a thin, probably Indian, washing silk of a type that seldom survives.",

The box from Liberty caused me a great deal of surprise and delight at your kindness in sending me such a lovely present.  The stuff is beautiful and it has often been my ambition to have a dress of it but I cannot help reproaching you at the same time for indulging me to such an extent.  I am just delighted with the gift itself, but, as you say, coming from you its value is greatly enhanced and I only wish that I might thank you for it properly.  The question that arises is, how can I get it made into a wearable form?  I am afraid the genius of the Tonbridge dressmakers is not sufficiently great to induce me to let them try their hands on it.  But I cannot yet make up my mind on such a weighty and important subject.  You see women are all alike; just as vain as one another!  I have been considering already the design of the dress but I think you must help me with that. It requires great consideration -\n\n\n/63\n\n\n\nMarlfield House\n\nJan. 8 84\n\nI am going to get my dress made by a dress maker here, the only one think who can carry out instructions at all near the mark.  I shall keep her well under my eye which will be possible if she comes here to work.  I think conclusions we came to very satisfactory with regard to the dress the other night.  I have a good idea of what it should be like.  It was sweet of you to make so much trouble about it.\n\n\n/68\n\n21 Jan\n\nHow sweet and thoughtful of you to send the lace and mittens, thoughtful because it was just what I wanted and was thinking of investing in the letter.  The lace is lovely and will suit the Liberty gown.",
