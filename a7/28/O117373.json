Such windows were used in the Middle East for centuries to adorn a variety of buildings, including palaces, mosques, houses, and tombs.\n\nThis window consists of small pieces of glass of different colours arranged within a plaster framework to form a depiction of carnations springing from a vase. It was probably made in nineteenth-century Cairo. During this period the increasing influence of European fashions led to a decline in the production of such windows.",
