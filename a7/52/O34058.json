Cottingham, was an authority on medieval architecture. He collected Gothic carvings, casts and drawings. In 1830 Lord Brougham asked him to provide major Gothic additions to an earlier house.\n\nThe style of the chair is typical of the heavy Gothic Revival of the 1830s and 1840s. Its fanciful outline, however, distinguishes it from the more purist Gothic furniture designed by A. W. N. Pugin (1812\u201352). Pugin\u2019s furniture was more closely based on real medieval models.",

Much of the furniture for Brougham Hall was made by the firm of Samuel Pratt, including the hall table and a large set of chairs which were delivered in August 1844, according to the diary of William Brougham, brother of Lord Brougham (Brougham Papers, University College Library, London). Although a pair of similar chairs are shown in a watercolour of The Armour Hall, c. 1850, by C.V. Richardson (V&A, Department of Word and Image, 3304:28), these had low backs composed of two large Gothic roundels with a rail below. It is possible that the Museum's  chair was part of a set supplied for the dining room which was decorated with linenfold panelling and a richly carved ceiling.",

As Lord Chancellor of England, he needed a country house sufficiently grand for his political and social entertaining. L.N. Cottingham was involved at Brougham Hall from 1830-1847 and created a castellated mansion built around a courtyard. The interiors, designed by Cottingham, included a cloistered passage, the walls painted with a copy of the Bayeux Tapestry, and a Norman bedroom, with richly decorated walls and a timber roof.",
