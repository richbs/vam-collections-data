They were issued by the 'Lusitania Souvenir Medal Commitee' of 32 Duke Street, London.\n\nThe British blockade of Germany led to increased German U-boot attacks on civilian as well as armed vessels. On 7 may 1915 the Lusitania was hit by two German torpedoes and sunk with the loss of 1,198 lives.\nKarl Goetz then struck this satirical medal, depicting Death as skeleton, selling tickets.",
