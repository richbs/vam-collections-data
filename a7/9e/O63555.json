Originally conceived by Roberto Pezzetta, Director of the Zanussi Design Centre, the concept for the shape was initially developed on 2D CAD, which could only create a simple surface model. The form itself was based on a fertile, pregnant shape which was preferred by the majority of people polled in market research. Through this study, the team also found that many people liked the 'duck egg' blue colour for a fridge as it conveyed the idea of freshness. Once it was passed by the Zanussi marketing department, the flat design was taken further into the detailing using a 3D CAD-CAM (Computer Aided Manufacture) package which was able to map out all the complex contours of the surface modelling. This sheet shows a variety of elevations where each coloured track corresponds to the same line in each example, and gives an accurate visual description, without the surface, of how all the internal components relate to each other. OZ is part of a range of kitchen products that are being developed by Electrolux-Zanussi at the Design Centre in Italy, including the 'TEO' oven and the 'ZEO' washing-machine. Zanussi have given names to their products as they believe there is a market for household products with characters. The relationship between these product types and their owners is such that many people treat their machines almost like pets and often give them names. As part of the move away from fitted kitchens at the end of the 1990s, the OZ fridge was not intended to be fitted into a linear rigid plan of cupboards and continuous work surfaces. To take this flexibility further, it is also thought by the designer and manufacturer to be able to sit comfortably in any room in the house, such as in the living room or a bedroom. This, like the Azumi Table=Chest (Plate 27) is part of the culture for unfixed furniture that is non-room specific. And so it fits easily into the multi-functional living areas in both space-restricted homes and in spacious loft-living in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. \nThese 3-dimensional CAD (Computer Aided Design) drawings were produced during the design engineering process of the OZ fridge.

As part of the move away from fitted kitchens at the end of the 1990s, the OZ fridge was not intended to be fitted into a linear rigid plan of cupboards and continuous work surfaces. To take this flexibility further, it is also thought by the designer and manufacturer to be able to sit comfortably in any room in the house, such as in the living room or a bedroom. This, like the Azumi Table=Chest (Plate 27) is part of the culture for unfixed furniture that is non-room specific. And so it fits easily into the multi-functional living areas in both space-restricted homes and in spacious loft-living in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. \nThese 3-dimensional CAD (Computer Aided Design) drawings were produced during the design engineering process of the OZ fridge. Originally conceived by Roberto Pezzetta, Director of the Zanussi Design Centre, the concept for the shape was initially developed on 2D CAD, which could only create a simple surface model. The form itself was based on a fertile, pregnant shape which was preferred by the majority of people polled in market research. Through this study, the team also found that many people liked the 'duck egg' blue colour for a fridge as it conveyed the idea of freshness. Once it was passed by the Zanussi marketing department, the flat design was taken further into the detailing using a 3D CAD-CAM (Computer Aided Manufacture) package which was able to map out all the complex contours of the surface modelling. This sheet shows a variety of elevations where each coloured track corresponds to the same line in each example, and gives an accurate visual description, without the surface, of how all the internal components relate to each other. OZ is part of a range of kitchen products that are being developed by Electrolux-Zanussi at the Design Centre in Italy, including the 'TEO' oven and the 'ZEO' washing-machine. Zanussi have given names to their products as they believe there is a market for household products with characters. The relationship between these product types and their owners is such that many people treat their machines almost like pets and often give them names.
