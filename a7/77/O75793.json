Both were bought by the Museum directly from the Paris International Exhibition of 1878, where the Koransha company were awarded a gold medal for their ceramics.  It is interesting to note that the Kogei Shiryo, published in the same year as the Paris Exhibition, mentions that of the 1500 labourers employed by the ceramic factories of Arita, as many as 450 worked for Koransha, making it one of the largest ceramic producers in Japan at that time.",
