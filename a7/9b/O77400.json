It resembles wattle work (rods on stakes interwoven with twigs or tree branches). Ironwork of this kind was often used in churches. This particular piece may have formed part of a confessional, an enclosure in which members of the congregation confessed their sins to a priest.\n\nTechnique\nThe technique of creating wrought iron to look like wattle was not well known in England. Examples of a similar style and date can be seen at the H\u201ctel de Ville, Louvain, Belgium, and at the Great Church, Breda, The Netherlands.\n\nPeople & Places\nThis grille may be from St George's Chapel, Windsor, Berkshire.  The chapel was built by Edward IV (ruled 1461-1470, 1471-1483)  in the last years of his reign. The coat of arms on the grille includes the cross of St George, patron saint of England. Several stylistic details are also close to surviving ironwork at Windsor. The gates of Edward IV's chantry chapel (a chapel endowed for the saying of masses for the founder's soul) form one of the most impressive pieces of 15th-century ironwork in Europe. There are also several examples of quality ironwork from the chapel. Several of these are thought to have been made either by John Tresilian of London or by a blacksmith from, or trained in, The Netherlands.",
