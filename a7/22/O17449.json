By the late 19th century wallpapers were widely used by all classes, in homes and also in public buildings.\n\nHistorical Associations\nPictorial wallpapers that commemorated historic events were popular novelties between 1850 and the 1890s. This example shows the Crystal Palace in Hyde Park, London, the site of the Great Exhibition of 1851. Many wallpapers of this kind were included in the displays of British design and manufacture in the Exhibition.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThis wallpaper was one of several pictorial patterns chosen by Henry Cole (1808-1882) for a display illustrating 'False Principles of Design' at the Museum of Ornamental Art in 1853. Cole was a leading critic of contemporary design in the decorative arts. He hoped to educate the taste of the public and of manufacturers by showing some of the worst examples and explaining their faults. However, papers of this kind continued to be produced for many years.",

The correct principles for paper-hangings were said to be:\n\n'1 The decoration of paper-hangings bears the same relation to the objects in a room, that a background does to the objects in a picture.\n 2 It should not, therefore, be such as to invite attention to itself - but be subdued in effect, and without strong contrasts either of form, colour or light and dark.\n 3 Nothing should be introduced which disturbs the sense of flatness.\n 4 All natural objects, therefore, when used as ornament for these manufactures, should be rendered conventionally flat and in simple tints.\n 5 While the decorative details should be arranged on symmetrical bases, these should be so resolved into the minor forms as not to be intrusively prominent.\n 6 Colour should be broken over the whole surface so as to give a general negative hue - rather than masses of positive colour.'\n\nHow the wallpaper exhibited here departed from these principles was explained in the catalogue entries, quoted in the descriptions given above.\n\nOther objects submitted to this derisive treatment included a pair of scissors in imitation of a stork with the beak opening the reverse way, 'glass tortured out of its true quality to make it into a cup of a lily or an anemone' and a gas burner with 'Gas flaming from the petal of a convolvulus'. <sup>9</sup>\n\n<sup>9</sup> <sup>Quotations from a Department of Science and Art, <i>A Catalogue of the Museum of Ornamental Art, at Marlborough House, Pall Mall, For the use of Students and Manufacturers, and the Public</i>, 1853.</sup>'\n<u>Victoria & Albert Museum Department of Engraving, Illustration and Design & Department of Paintings Accessions 1934</u> London: Published under the Authority of the Board of Education, 1935\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n<b>ANONYMOUS</b> (Wall-papers, English).\nPanel of wall-paper, showing the Crystal Palace seen through a garden archway, Probably printed by Heywood, Higginbottom and Smith, Manchester.     c. 1853-55\n     <i>Machine-printed.</i>     (39 1/8 x 21)                                                                                  E. 158-1934",

It is described in the catalogue to the collection, issued by the Department of Science and Art, as 'Perspective representation of the Crystal Palace and Serpentine; with flights of steps and architectural framework'.\nIt was included as an example of poor design because it falsified the perspective. This paper was, however,  seen by manufacturers as a demonstration of their technical skill. It was printed in eight colours with great accuracy and complexity.",
