A luxurious and costly object, it incorporates cut and polished agate (a type of quartz). Agate was commonly found in Germany, and the material requires a skilled worker to manipulate the hard surface to produce such a delicate object.",

They include pieces made for use in private chapels, such as plate and shrines, as well as personal objects like reliquaries and jewels used in private devotions. It was mainly the great houses, like Chatsworth, Hatfield and Arundel Castle, that had a private chapel. They held services for the family, their guests and servants and had their own altar plate. Many of the objects made for private chapels were similar to those made for parish churches. \n\nJewelled religious objects are used as an aid to prayer and were found in a much wider social context. Reliquary pendants act as a focus for devotion through the relics or images of saints they contain, while the rosary provides a discipline and structure for private prayer. Such pieces are often treasured personal possessions, passed down through generations.",
