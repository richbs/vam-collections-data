Width,</i> 10 5/12 <i>inches.</i>'\nDavid Solkin, <u>Richard Wilson: The Landscape of Reaction</u> (London: Tate Gallery, 1982): 'In both subject and technique this drawing relates closely to the works fo Giambattista Piazzetta (1683-1754), a Venetian history-painter whose chalk studies of heads were well known throughout eighteenth-century Europe. Wilson probably sketches this local \"type\" in or around 1752, when he produced his only paintings in Piazzetta's manner, the \"Old Man\" and the \"Capuchin\" [. . . ] acquired by Ralph Howard. If such a dating is correct, this would make the V&amp;A \"Italian\" one of the earliest known Wilson drawings in black and white chalk on middle-tint paper; that Piazzetta may have been one important source for this technique has not been previously suggested.'
