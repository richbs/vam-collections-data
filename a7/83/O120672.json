The stone is polished but retains its natural, uneven surface, and has been backed with green foil to enhance its colour. The hoop and bezel of the ring are enamelled in translucent green and opaque rose-pink painted over white. Pink enamelling is thought to have been introduced to the Indian subcontinent from Kabul by a craftsman called Kaiser Agha. He worked for Asaf ad-Daula, Nawab of Oudh, from 1775-1797, and had reputedly learned his craft in Iran. The palette become popular in Lucknow and Faizabad, the main cities of the kingdom, and from there it spread to Benares (Varanasi). Indian pink enamelling is therefore traditionally known as \"Benares enamel\", even though the style was also found in Delhi and Lucknow. \nThe ring was acquired by the Indian Museum in London in 1855, probably from an exhbition, and was described as being from \"Bengal\". At the time, this denoted Bengal Presidency, which included both Benares and Delhi. The ring was transferred to the South Kensington Museum with other parts of the Indian Museum's collection in 1879.",
