            "public_access_description": "This shield is known as 'The Italian Poets' Shield. It was decorated by the celebrated French metalworker Antoine Vechte with portraits of medieval poets and scenes from their works. The Museum bought it from Le Page Moutier of Paris for \u00a3220 at the Great Exhibition of 1851.\n\nDuring the nineteenth century the art of fine metal chasing was extolled as true to Renaissance craftsmanship. Vechte was its master. Lauded as the new Cellini, his vases, candelabra and shields were highlights of the metals manufacturers' stands at a number of international exhibitions. \n\nThis shield recalls a sixteenth-century tradition in which armour and weapons made for parade and display were as much the products of the goldsmith as the armourer. On it Vechte has chased portraits of poets and scenes from their works including Ariosto (1474-1533), Tasso (1544-95), Dante (1265-1321) and Petrarch (1304-74). The quality of the workmanship is extraordinary.",

Vechte established his reputation in Paris, but worked in London from about 1849 to 1862.\n\nHistorical significance: Vechte worked in London during the 1850s for the major firm of Hunt and Roskell. His work was to have a profound influence on contemporary English designers.\n\nIn 1854 the Museum employed Elkington and Company to make electrotype reproductions of this shield for use by design students and to sell commercially. Silvered and oxidised copies cost \u00a34. 15s. Three electrotypes of the shield remain in the Museum's collection: REPRO.1854-44, REPRO.1854C-44, REPRO.1854D-44.",

            "historical_context_note": "During the nineteenth century the art of fine metal chasing was extolled as true to Renaissance craftsmanship. Antoine Vechte was its master. Lauded as the new Cellini, his vases, candelabra and shields were highlights of the metals manufacturers' stands at international exhibitions. \n\nThis shield recalls a sixteenth-century tradition in which armour and weapons made for parade and display were as much the products of the goldsmith as the armourer. On it Vechte has chased portraits of poets and scenes from their works including Ariosto (1474-1533), Tasso (1544-95), Dante (1265-1321) and Petrarch (1304-74). The quality of the workmanship is extraordinary.\n\nThe V&A bought the shield for \u00a3220 from Le Page Moutier of Paris at the 1851 Exhibition. Vechte's work was resisted by A.W.N. Pugin, the great champion of Christian Gothic, as 'pagan' although he acknowledged what was, 'in the abstract, an exceedingly clever piece of chasing'. Elkingtons made electrotype copies of the shield for the Department of Science and Art which sold for \u00a34.15s.",
