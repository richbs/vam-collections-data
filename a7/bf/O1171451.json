This example features a portrait of  Debbie Harry, lead singer of the American new wave/punk group, Blondie.\n\nThe picture features a rendering of her signature in the top left corner. It uses her full name, Deborah Harry, unusually. She was mostly known as Debbie until the release of her 1989 solo album, Def, Dumb & Blonde. Although she saw some success as a solo artist, with this album being certified silver in the UK, her solo career never reached the heights of her Blondie days. She was still considered a global sex symbol, popular with both women and men; this picture would most likely have been produced for a teenager's bedroom.",
