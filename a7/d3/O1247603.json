The dress is made from a cream cotton printed with a repeating floral pattern, with white lines for flower stems and stylised grey coloured flowers, resembling daisies. From a distance, the printed pattern gives the effect of the broderie anglaise technique. The dress has a high round neckline and fastens at the back using a metal zip. The sleeves are full length with an elasticised cuff sewn  2cms in to create a ruffled sleeve end. The dress bodice is fitted with two tucks at the front and at the back. At the waist the dress flares to a full skirt. The dress is short and would  fall at about mid thigh length on a baby.",
