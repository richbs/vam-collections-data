            "public_access_description": "At the end of the twelfth century, Cyprus was conquered by Crusaders, whose descendants ruled for almost 400 years, from 1191 to 1571. During that time, Cyprus became the most important commercial centre in the east Mediterranean, acting as the principal trading hub between Western Europe and the countries of the Levant, orchestrated through Italian-dominated maritime traders. During this period, production of ceramics flourished, supplying local demand, but international markets, as the Cypriot wares are frequently found in excavations throughout the Mediterranean region.\n\nThis bowl depicts a couple sharing or adopting a garment, a custom which is associated with Armenian traditions, particularly as part of wedding ceremonies. Similar depictions are widespread on sgrafito (sgrafiato) wares made in Medieval Cyprus, based on a tradition introduced from Armenian Cilicia. There are often called \"wedding bowls\".\n\nThe two principal production centres were at Lemba, near Paphos, in the south west of the island, and at Lapithos, in the district of Kyrenia on the north coast. In addition, there was probably a production centre at Kato Paphos and at Enkomi, near Famgusta, but the evidence for these centres is not as well preserved as at Lemba and Lapithos. The medieval glazed pottery of Cyprus is a local variation of late- and post-Byzantine pottery and shares the same basic features as ceramics produced in the rest of the Byzantine world. It also has affinities with the so-called \"crusader\" pottery of Syria and Palestine and shows evidence of considerable western influence, particularly in the decorative subject matter.",

A somewhat similar dish is illustrated in the Los Angeles Medieval Ceramics exhibition catalogue (see ref.) p. 26, where it is attributed to Cyprus, 13th century.\n\nCyprus was conquered during the Third Crusade in 1191 and remained in Western hands until 1572, when it fell to the Ottomans. Pottery was made on the island during the early centuries of the Byzantine Empire but glazed pottery does not appear until the early years of the 13th century, according to archeological finds. Until the late 13th century, Cypriot ware seems to have been decorated with only a single coloured glaze. At the end of the century we find objects with yellowish brown and green streaks, following the outlines of the incised decoration. The glazing and style of decoration is close to that produced at al-Mina, also known as Port Saint Symeon (Port St. Simeon) ware. Cypriot pottery was exported in large numbers to the Latin settlements in the Holy Land. It is the most common import found in excavations in Jerusalem.",
