The ground is covered with fairly small flowers on angular stems, with a depiction of a vase at each corner.\n\n\nWarp:  white cotton; (Z5S) 3Z; 34-37 threads per inch (146 per dm); depressed.\n\nWeft: white cotton and blue cotton in irregular bands but most of the field is blue and the borders at the top and bottom are blue; (white) Z3S, (blue) Z6S and often used as 2 parallel threads per shoot; 2 shoots after each row of knots; 17-20 knots per sq. inch (68-80 per dm).\n\nPile: wool; 11 colours, some faded: red, orange, yellow, green (faded), light green, dark blue, blue, light blue, light purple (faded), black, white; asymmetrical knot, open to the left and tied around 2 threads; 289-370 knots per sq. inch (4964-5840 per sq. dm).\n\nSide finish: one cord oversewn with purple silk.\n\nEnd finish: Lower: 2.5 cm. plainweave with white cotton and with one thick weft cord through which warp loops are twined.  Upper; evidence of weft twining in orange/green wool.\n\nDesign: field: light green ground with stems bearing sprays of flowers and leaves.  In each corner is a part medallion with a red ground containing a stylised vase and similar flowers.  In the centre is a red ground irregular medallion which extends to all four edges and contains similar flowers.  In the centre of this is a light blue medallion with two pendants.  The stems of the sprays in this area are white and they are black elsewhere.  In the centre is a white 'star' with four pendants which in turn contains a blue and red star-like flower.\n\nMain border: light green ground with a stylised meander on a red stem with squarish flowers.  This pattern, on a blue ground, borders the red medallion in the field.  \n(2) yellow ground with a floral meander on a red stem with blue leaves and rosettes.\nOuter border: (2) and (1)\n\nOutermost border: reciprocal diamond heads in blue/light green.",
