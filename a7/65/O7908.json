There is a smaller peach on each shoulder and a band of pink overlay around neckrim.\nThe glass has a waxy quality in appearance; the partial nature of the carving and incising suggests that it may be unfinished. The lack of attention applied to the carving suggests a date during the period of disruption in China between 1850 and 1870, or slightly later.\nThe bottle has a faceted foot formed by overlay with a solid underneath.",
