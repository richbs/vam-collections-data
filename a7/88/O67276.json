This yellow and red design was popular for over a century.  It was worked from drawings and so its proportions could be easily changed by selecting which part of the repeating design was to be woven. There is horizontal repair across most of the upper part of this carpet.  If you look at the left hand end (just inside the red field) you will see that the lines of knots above and below the repair are not parallel. This part of the carpet was badly woven and a ridge would have formed when it was on the floor. Someone later cut the carpet and rejoined it to make it lie flat.",

The name 'Lotto', after the painter Lorenzo Lotto (c.1480-1556) who depicted some in his work, is used as a convenient label for carpets with this type of endless, angular arabesque pattern - most often yellow on red.\n\nThere is a seam in this carpet which runs almost across the entire width; it begins at the top, towards the left hand side.  It suggests that the carpet did not lie flat when it was cut from the loom and that a narrow ridge was formed - uneven tension on the warp threads would have caused this.  This ridge would have worn quickly into a long tear, which has subsequently been repaired.\"",
