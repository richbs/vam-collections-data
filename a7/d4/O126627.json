His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean. \n\nRing Round the Moon, a translation of Jean Anouilh's play L'Invitation au Ch\u00e2teau by Christopher Fry, was first performed at the Globe  Theatre (now the Gielgud Theatre), in 1950.  It enjoyed a substantial run in the West End before moving to New York. \n\nPeter Brook, the director, suggested that the setting should be a winter garden or conservatory with plants and trees.  According to Carl Toms, Messel's assistant, Messel took his inspiration from a Portuguese railway station.  To give the set a light, weightless quality, he insisted that it should be made from metal rather than wood, which was then the standard material used for theatre set building. Although untypical of Messel's style, the set is one of his most memorable designs, and complemented the elegance and fantasy of the poetic drama.",
