He is shown seated in a shell throne in the midst of an ocean filled with strange fish and a distant cave. \n\nThe print is lavishly decorated green/gold metallic foil. This has been used to create the fish scale armour of 'the ocean king' and also the scales of the sea horse that sits at the base of his throne. The King is also dressed in a white silk tunic decorated with motifs of sea shells and star fish and a crimson cape which billows out behind him. He carries a gold trident in his left hand.\n\nTinsel prints were created from etched portraits of theatrical stars in popular roles they played on the London stage. They were hand-painted in watercolour and decorated with scraps of material and tinsel additions. They were popular during the first half of the 19th century and were considered an adult, rather than a child's hobby. By the 1830s it was possible to buy the tinsel, leather and feather ornaments to go with each image.",
