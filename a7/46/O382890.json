Sk\u00e5ne province, in the extreme south of Sweden, has the richest tradition, and more jewellery was worn there than in any other district.   Almost all the Swedish traditional jewellery at the V&A comes from Sk\u00e5ne.  \n\nThe most popular necklace was a choker, made of several chains fastened at the front with a large decorative snap-clasp.  This is the clasp from such a necklace.  The five loops at the sides show that the necklace would originally have had five chains.  These clasps are often decorated with filigree and coloured pastes.  Swedish traditional jewellers made lavish use of coloured glass.  Red was the most popular colour, as everywhere in Europe, often mixed with green or blue.  The small loop on the lower edge would have held a small pendant heart.\n\nIt is marked twice with the maker\u2019s mark SN.  Stephan Noblin was a silversmith who worked in Ystad, the main centre for Sk\u00e5ne traditional jewellery, from 1795 until his death in 1839.  After his death, his widow continued in business for a few years more, using the same mark.",
