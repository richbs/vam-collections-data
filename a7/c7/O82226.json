The latter is engraved: <i>22 / L.Crosse /Eliz.th Greville/  L.dy Guildford</i>. \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> Among the heirlooms of the Barons North de Kirtling at Wroxton Abbey, near Banbury, Oxfordshire; acquired by the Hon F H A Wallop in 1922 and lent to the V&A 1927-49; the ownership transferred to Alan Evans, probably in 1933, and by him bequeathed to the National Gallery, 1974; placed on indeterminate loan at the V&A. (See Appendix 3.) \n\n<b>Exhibited:</b> New Haven etc. 1981-2, no. 60. \n\n<b>Literature: </b>Long 1929, p. 108; Murdoch 1978, p. 288, figs. 33-4; <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 13; Murdoch 1981, p. 162, repro. in col. pl. 24f; Reynolds 1988, p. 84, fig. 47. \n\nThe discovery of the autograph inscription on the back of this miniature, in conjunction with the monogram on the front, was one of the factors which compelled reappraisal in 1977-8 of the then conventional account of Peter Cross and 'Lawrence Crosse'. \n\nThe identification of the sitter as Lady Elizabeth Greville, engraved on the backplate, stands as a warning against the credibility of such later inscriptions. It can be explained by the provenance of the miniature. Elizabeth Greville was the first wife of Lord Guildford; she was born c.1675 and the marriage took place in 1695. Lord Guildford was the 2nd Baron of this (the second) creation; his father, the Hon. Francis North, lawyer and politician ('Lord Keeper Guildford'), had been created Baron Guildford in 1683, having married in 1671/2 Frances (illegitimate daughter of the 3rd Earl of Downe), by whom he acquired Wroxton Abbey. Elizabeth, Baroness Guildford, died however in childbirth in 1699, and her husband then married Alice Brownlow, one of the daughters and co-heirs of Sir John Brownlow, Bart, of Humby, Lincolnshire. The assumption is that the descendants of the North family, trying to assign names to unidentified portraits among the heirlooms, searched the genealogies for a suitable candidate of the right period, and came up with Elizabeth, the first wife. \n\nLady Katherine seems to have had no relationship of blood or matrimony with the Norths but was perhaps a friend of the family. She was the eldest daughter and heiress of the 6th Earl of Thanet (1644-1729) and was born on 24 April 1690; on 22 April 1708 she married Edward Watson, styled Viscount Sondes, the heir to the earldom of Rockingham. Katherine died on 13 February 1733/4 (according to Burke and Debrett; Cokayne (1887) gives 24 April 1693 for her birth and 23 January 1708 for the marriage). Katherine was named after her mother, Lady Catherine Cavendish, the fourth daughter of the 2nd Duke of Newcastle. When Lord Thanet asked for Lady Catherine's hand in marriage, her father 'answered that he would prefer his elder daughter Margaret to be married first, and as she would be the greater heiress, perhaps Lord Thanet might think proper <i>to change his mind from Kate for her</i>. He added, however, <i>when hee sees them hee shall take his choyse.'</i> (1) Thanet commissioned Cross to paint Catherine's portrait in May 1685, possibly on the prompting again of the Duke, whose connection seems to have provided rich patronage for Cross.(2) \n\nIt is interesting that the Brownlows, too, were Cross patrons, so perhaps Alice Brownlow was the friend of Lady Katherine Tufton and kept her portrait at Wroxton. \n\n1 Quoted from Goulding 1914-5, p.134. \n2 Ibid., <i>passim.\"</i>",
