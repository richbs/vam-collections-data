Such bowls were used by barber surgeons, barbers who would also perform basic medical procedures, to shave clients and possibly also to collect blood during the bloodletting process. Some have a small hollow receptacle in the rim which could be used for shaving soap.\nTwo holes, pierced trough the rim, can fit a piece of string for suspension.\nAn early eighteenth-century English delftware barber's bowl is decorated with the tools of the barber's trade (V&amp;A Museum number 297-1869) inside the well of the bowl: scissors, a knife, soap and a comb. On the rim is an inscription implying that this particular bowl was for professional use at a barber's shop rather than for domestic use. Similar basins were also made in brass and pewter. Famously, in Cervantes' Don Quixote, published in two volumes in 1605 and 1615 respectively, Quixote wears an old pewter shaving basin on his head which he believes to be a old magic helmet.",
