The artist provides a compelling view of life on these small islands in his various photographs of 1954, which include many portraits as well as landscapes.  Here, there are several buildings visible in the distance, including one at the centre of the composition.  However, the vast sky and seascape as well as the wild horses on the beach in the foreground provide the focus of the photograph.",
