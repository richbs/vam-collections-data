A ballet first performed by the Ballets Russes in 1912 on the 13th of May at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet, Paris. They first performed this ballet in London on the 27th of February 1913 at the Royal Opera House.\n\nThe costume consists of a lavishly decorated bodice appliqu\u00e9d with diamonds of yellow, blue, green, and white, silk and bands of metallic gold braid. Small peach and white circles of a material (possibly plasitc or resin) have been stitched across the entire surface of this bodice and, when new, both this and the metallic braid would have sparked under the stage lights. The bodice was worn with a pair of loose black silk trousers (gathered at the waist and ankle), the surface of which has been painted/dyed with a series of pale orange circles.\n\nThe term 'negro' has been used here to reflect the name originally given to this character in 1912.  This term was used historically to describe people of black (sub-Saharan) African heritage but, since the 1960s, has fallen from usage and, increasingly, is considered offensive. The term is therefore repeated here in its original historical context.",
