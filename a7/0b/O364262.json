During the nineteenth century wealthy woman from urban areas in Tunisia used them to cover their face and head while they were out in public.  In the centre is a black rectangle that has been woven so finely it is transparent, this would hide the woman\u2019s face while at the same time allowing her to see out. Around the black panel are elaborately decorated woven borders.  The motifs show both Turkish and Andalusian influences and an Arabic inscription has been incorporated into the pattern.  \n\nThis ajar was one of seventeen textiles purchased by the V&A from the Tunis stand at the Great Exhibition of 1851, and is therefore one of the first textiles from Africa to have been acquired by the V&A.",
