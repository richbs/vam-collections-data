Signed in facsimile <i>Bertall</i>. Lettered with details of the paper's publication and within the design <i>Arbre De La Libert\u00e9</i> and the titles of many Parisian newspapers. Gillotage, coloured by hand. 17\u00be x 11\u00bc in. (45 x 28.5 cm.), E.2224-1962\n\nRaoul Rigault (1846-71) sits on a ladder clipping <i>feuilles</i> (either \u2018leaves\u2019 or \u2018newspapers\u2019) from a tree sarcastically labelled <i>Arbre de la Libert\u00e9</i>. Between 5 and 18 May this dictatorial State Prosecutor ordered the suppression of 23 newspapers hostile to the Commune including <i>L' Etoile, Le Soir, La Cloche, Le Moniteur du Peuple, Echo du Soir, La Nation Souveraine</i> and <i>L'Opinion National</i>. Rochefort's <i>Mot d'Ordre</i> was not suppressed although it ceased publication voluntarily on 20 May. To the right of Rigault, Delescluze surveys the scene, Paschel Grousset encourages him and Pyat, who had agreed to the suppression of the papers in the H\u00f4tel de Ville and criticized it in his <i>Le Vengeur</i>, throws a tantrum. To the Prosecutor's left two figures applaud him: the personification of <i>Le P\u00e8re Duch\u00eane</i>, the Commune's most scurrilous paper, and Jules Vall\u00e8s of <i>Le Cri du Peuple.
