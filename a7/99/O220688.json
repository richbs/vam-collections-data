Italian goldsmiths were expert at making a little material go a very long way.  Many pieces seem too large to wear comfortably, but they are usually made of very thin gold, and are much lighter than they appear.\n\nThe dominant colours in Italian traditional jewellery are red and gold.  In the south the jewellers often used coral, but garnets were more common in the north.  The garnets in this necklace almost certainly have metallic foil behind them, to improve their colour.  \n\nIt was bought as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
