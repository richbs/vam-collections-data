            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nCovered cups have always been the staple of the goldsmith's trade, but but their design and function has evolved. In the 18th century, as the two-handled cup developed into a ceremonial object, rather than a functional one, the form became fossilised. \n\nDesign &  Making\nThe shape of this cup, a simple inverted bell, is typical of cups from the 1720s until as late as the 1780s. The leading London goldsmith, Paul de Lamerie, is most famous for producing silver in the exuberant Rococo style, which became popular in the capital from the 1730s. The technique used here of decorative mouldings applied to a plain body and lid is characteristic of the earlier and plainer R\u00e9gence style (which originated in France during the regency, 1715-1723, of Philippe, duc d'Orl\u00e9ans). However, the elaborate cast mouldings reveal how some London goldsmiths were moving away from the simple pierced decoration favoured by earlier generations towards a more ornate style.\n\nOwnership & Use\nCovered cups were the ideal grand gift, and a popular choice of prize for sports. In particular, they were presented to and used by male societies, such as colleges or trade and craft associations. It was customary, for example, for a new member of a livery company to receive a gift of inscribed silver. As a result of their status as heirlooms, a disproportionately large number of cups have survived, compared to other categories of silver plate.",
