This was due in part to religious revivals in Britain, and partly to the increasing accessibility of Palestine and Egypt for artists and other visitors.\n\nSubject Depicted\nEgypt as a source of subjects for painters provided both the stupendous ruins of the Egypt of the Pharaohs and the splendid buildings of medieval Cairo. The district of Grand Cairo depicted here is Bab Zuwayla, one of the three main gates of Cairo, built in 1092 AD.  This was also known locally as Bab Mutwalli (hence Roberts's title). The twin minarets above the gate are those of the Mosque of Sultan Mu'ayyad Shaykh, built just inside the gate between 1415 and 1421.\n\nPeople\nDavid Roberts spent one and half months working in Cairo, intending to balance his covering of Egypt's ancient temples with paintings of the country's Islamic architecture. His skill in dramatically rendering both the architecture and the lively street scene owes a lot to his early work for the theatre and opera. He first made his name in London in the 1820s as both a designer and painter of stage sets and panoramic backdrops at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, and at Covent Garden.",

Apprenticed to a house painter from about 1808-15, and also worked as a theatrical scenery painter. Moved to London 1822; worked at Theatre Royal and Covent Garden. Achieved a high reputation as a painter in oils and watercolours, mainly of architectural views. Exhibited 101 works at the RA between 1826 and 1864, 32 at the BI 1825-59, and 50 at the SBA 1824-36 (elected Member 1825, President 1830). Elected ARA 1838, RA 1841. Travelled frequently and extensively; from his first visit to France 1824, he toured in Belgium, Holland, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the Near East. Published lithographic reproductions of his drawings, notably 'Picturesque Sketches in Spain' (1837) and 'The Holy Land, Syria, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt and Nubia' (1842-9). Died 25 November 1864; his studio sale was at Christie's 13-20 May 1865, and that of his son-in-law Henry Bicknell 7-9 April 1881. \n\t\nLIT:  J Ballantine <u>The Life of David Roberts</u>, RA 1866; H Guiterman (et al) <u>David Roberts</u>; Artist Adventurer Scottish Arts Council exhibition catalogue 1981; H Guiterman and B Llewellyn David Roberts Barbican Art Gallery exhibition catalogue 1986 \n\n<b>The Gate of Metwaley, Cairo </b>\nFA176 Neg31858 \nPanel, 76.1 X 62.8 cm (30 X 24 \u00be3/4 ins) Signed and dated 'David Roberts, RA 1843' bl \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nExhibited at the RA in 1843 as 'Gate of the Mosque of Metwalis, Grand Cairo' and sold to John Sheepshanks for \u00a3105. \nThe southern gate of the old city, now in the centre of modern Cairo, was built in 1092, the minarets above of the Mosque and Tomb of Sultan Muayyad Shaykh were added 1415-20. The view is from Shavia Darb-alAhmar (Red Street). A watercolour of the same view, but omitting the left-hand building, is dated 1838 (private collection; exh Barbican Art Gallery 1986 (138), repr <u>Guiterman and Llewellyn</u> p 115). Roberts toured the Near East between September 1838 and May 1839, and was in Cairo in December and January. While he was impressed by the Picturesque qualities of the architecture, he found working difficult: 'I have stood in the crowded streets of Cairo jostled and stared at until I came home quite sick no one in looking over my sketches will ever think of the pain and trouble I have had to contend with in collecting them' (MS <u>Eastern Journal</u>, 1 January 1839). \nThe Art Union critic found that 'The pencil of this celebrated artist descends to the nicest <i>minutiae</i>, where necessary, an example of which is here offered. The street is crowded with figures, camels, ete., in perfect keeping with the Mauresque architecture'. \n\nEXH: RA 1843 (210); <i>David Roberts</i> Barbican Art Gallery 1986 (146) \n\nLIT: <u>Art Union</u> 1843, p166 \n\n\nRonald Parkinson.\"",
