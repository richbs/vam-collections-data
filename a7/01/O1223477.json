He came to prominence designing information posters for the War Office during World War II; later important clients included London Transport, BOAC and British Railways. Games' iconic symbol of the Festival of Britain was used throughout the Festival, on posters, guides, leaflets, souvenirs, on the side of the Festival Ship Campania, and at events all over the country. It combined the essential elements of what would become known as the Festival Style: it was romantic, patriotic, but also jaunty and modern. \n\nIn this poster the emblem is combined with an evocative image of the British Isles, underlining the nationwide reach of the Festival of Britain. It was described by William Feaver as: 'Britannia resurgent stuck like a golf tee into the map of England, pinpointing and pirouetting with a subliminal suggestion of St Paul's looming through the war clouds, the phoenix arising and taking it on the chin.'",
