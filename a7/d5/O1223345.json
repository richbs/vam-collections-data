James of Bow Street, London, during his second London period when he lived in Bow Street, Covent Garden, from 1795 to 1800. \n\nIt advertises animals in Pidcock's menagerie at Exeter Change, an exhibition hall in London's Strand. The menagerie was divided into three rooms and included African lions, tigers, beavers, emus and ostriches. According to The Morning Chronicle in 1808, the animals could be viewed for a shilling a room, or all three rooms for two shillings and sixpence. Gilbert Pidcock began with a small travelling menagerie, but in 1793 bought the stock of Thomas Clark, a dealer in wild birds and animals who had the lease of Exeter Change and the Lyceum Thetre. Pidcock kept his animals there but toured them to London fairs and the provinces during the summer. Gilbert Pidcock died in 1810 aged 67, and was succeeded by Polito and then Cross. All the animals were removed to the Surrey Zoological Gardens in about 1828, after which Exeter Change was demolished.",
