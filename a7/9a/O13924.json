The fullness at the hip is evenly gathered to the front of the waistband. This pair is made of cotton with a printed double 'zigzag' pattern above the ankles.\n\nCossack trousers were introduced to Britain in 1814. In this year Tsar Aleksandr I travelled to London from Russia for the peace celebrations that followed the abdication of the French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte in April of that year. The Cossack soldiers in Aleksandr's entourage wore a similar style of trousers, which soon became fashionable in Europe.",
