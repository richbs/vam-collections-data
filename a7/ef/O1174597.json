In 1848, the year slavery was abolished in France, he caught visitors' attention at the Salon by exhibiting a bust of a Sudanese. He was a member of Society of Anthropology and brought back busts and medallions of his encounters during ethnographic missions (for the French Government) in Algeria, Greece and Egypt. He challenged notions of beauty believing strongly that: 'The most beautiful negro is not the one who looks most like us'.\n\nThis is an electrotype (an exact copy in metal of another object, made in a replication mould) of a medallion by Cordier of 1861 which itself reproduced, in relief, an etching (of about 1856) by his contemporary Henri Valentin. In this etching, entitled Trois Types de la Race Humaine, Valentin juxtaposed three busts by Cordier, referred to at the time as a Negro of the Sudan, an Arab of El Aghouat, and a Chinese Man. These busts were donated by Cordier to the Anthropological Society, Paris, in 1862.  Valentin identified these respectively on his work as Japhet, Sem and Cham, the sons of Noah from whom, according to biblical tradition, we are all descended.",

According to the catalogue, the Galerie Elseneur in Paris had the medallion at that time, though they have not responded to an emailed request for information about its current whereabouts.  \n\nThe medallion reproduces in relief an etching (one ref says engraving) by Henri Valentin (1822-1886) of <u>Trois Types de la Race Humaine</u> (1856?) now at the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay. This work by Valentin was reproduced as the frontispiece to an album of 19 photographs taken by Charles Marville of Cordier's sculptures (<u>Sculptures Ethnographiques, Marbres et Bronzes d'apr\u00e8s divers types de races humaines</u>). The album was Cordier's initiative. Valentin and Cordier would have known each other; both studied under the sculptor Fran\u00e7ois Rude (1784-1855). \n\nValentin's etching in turn juxtaposes three busts by Cordier, of a Negro of the Sudan, an Arab of El Aghouat, and a Chinese Man, which were donated by Cordier to the Anthropological Society, Paris, in 1862.

Appropriating an ethnographic science then only in its beginnings, he was also remarkable for his use of polychromy in sculpture, in particular of the onyx-marble of Algeria. From his ethnographic missions in Algeria, Greece and Egypt, he brought back busts and medallions, portraits born of his encounters with the local inhabitants.\n\nCordier has several links with the history of the V&A. He exhibited at the Great Exhibition in 1851 (from which Queen Victoria bought his 'Sa\u00efd Abdallah' and another bust) and at the International Exhibition of 1862 (and widely especially in Paris and London 1848-1906). He invited Rodin to work with him in Nice in 1879 on the balcony of the Villa Neptune, for which Cordier paid Rodin 3 francs/hour.",
