            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nA suitable ceramic bowl was soon devised for the consumption at many social levels of the new hot drink known as punch, which had first appeared in England around 1680.  At first delftware (tin-glazed earthenware) was used, later white or brown stoneware, and finally creamware and Pearlware (types of light-coloured pottery). Heavy cut glass was occasionally used, despite its unsuitability for hot drinks and use by rowdy revellers. But the ideal material for punch bowls was Chinese porcelain, and many such bowls were regularly being imported by the end of the 17th century.\n\nThis huge creamware bowl is one of the largest earthenware examples to survive. Though unmarked, it may reasonably be attributed to the Herculaneum factory at Liverpool,  which made large punch bowls in both crearmware and stoneware.\n\nTime\nBy the late 18th century the old warring Whig and Tory political  clubs, together with the semi-secret Jacobite clubs (for supporters of the exiled Stuart pretenders to the throne), had dwindled away. There were, however, still many gentlemen's drinking clubs that catered for various tastes, professions and social classes. As this splendidly decorated bowl testifies, some still remain secret. Apart from the enigma of the patriotic English and Latin inscriptions, a further puzzle is that Lady Charlotte Schreiber (1813-1895) acquired the bowl in Sweden. Perhaps it served some group of gentlemen involved in the Baltic sea trade, but if so, what is the significance of the cat?",
