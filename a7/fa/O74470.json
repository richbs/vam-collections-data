Both his wife, Maria, and his closest friend, John Fisher, had died, and his two eldest sons had left home. He is perhaps expressing his personal unhappiness in the watercolour, for the image is certainly a melancholy one. The painting was exhibited in the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition of 1836. Some of the lines that accompanied this painting in the catalogue describe 'The mysterious monument of Stonehenge, standing remote on a bare and boundless heath...'. Constable himself probably wrote them.",

The sheet of paper on which most of the water-colour is painted is irregularly torn at the left and top edges, and has been extended by the artist by about 30 mm. (11 ins.) in width at the left and 12 mm. (1/2 in.) at the top, by being laid on another piece of paper; the drawing is carried over these extensions. The hare in the lower left-hand corner is on a separate piece of paper which has been stuck on to the drawing; the left leg of the hare is flaking off: \n\nNo. 395 [1629-1888] is the water-colour exhibited by Constable at the Royal Academy (No. 581) in 1836. It is laid down on what may be presumed to be the original mount (see also No. 359 [1628-1888]), with a gilt line round the drawing. The mount bears the inscription written in ink in a careful script <i>Stonehenge\" The mysterious monument of Stonehenge, standing remote on a bare and boundless heath, as much unconnected with the events of past ages as it is with the uses of the present, carries you back beyond all historical records into the obscurity of a totally unknown period\"</i>. This quotation was printed with the title of the drawing in the Royal Academy catalogue of 1836. The drawing was finished by 14 September 1835, when Constable wrote to Leslie (L. ed. S., p. 332) \"I have made a beautifull drawing of Stonehenge; I venture to use such an expression to you\". \nFor the preliminary sketches see Nos. 186 [309-1888] and 396 [800-1888].\"\nEvans, M., with N.
