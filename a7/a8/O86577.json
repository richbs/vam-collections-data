It was made in Sicily or southern Italy. For its base, however, the maker reused an earlier piece of woodwork with ivory inlay. This woodwork is an extremely rare example of a technique used in Cairo in the Fatimid period (969\u20131171).\n\nIn the medieval period, luxury goods from the Islamic Middle East found a ready market in Christian-ruled Europe. These imports enjoyed such enormous prestige that luxury goods made in Europe were often decorated in Islamic styles.",
