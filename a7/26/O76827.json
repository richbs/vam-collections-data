Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. Above all they had to have the means of attaching the cord. Although netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated is the katabori (shape carving). This is a three-dimensional carving, such as this one. From around 1750, the designs of katabori netsuke became more realistic. This was probably due to the influence of European painting as seen in Dutch works (rangaku), as the Japanese had very little direct contact with Europeans. As a result, craftsmen began to draw from nature and use perspective, light and shade. They paid great attention to detail, such as animal fur. As a result, carvers in Kyoto made a whole group of classic animal netsuke. This tiger netsuke is one example. The carver was Tomotada (active 1781), who was one of the great Kyoto netsukeshi (netsuke craftsmen). He specialised in oxen and tigers, either on their own or in pairs of a mother and young.",
