H.Chirgwin (1854-1922) who was presented with a ' Testimonial' to fifty years in the business. Otherwise known as 'the white-eyed Kaffir', George Chirgwin  started as a black-face minstrel but accidentally developed his trademark appearance of one eye painted white in a diamond shape.  He would wear a very tall hat and long white coat over a tight-fitting dark jersey and tights. His act consisted of comic patter, playing various instruments, and singing songs, his favourite being 'My fiddle is a sweetheart'.  Despite his exotic appearance however, much of his act relied on Cockney humour and references.\n\nThere was a crowded house at the Oxford in the event.  Chirgwin began the evening performing some of his best-known songs, after which he appeared on stage surrounded by the committee who had awarded him the honour. The Testimonial - a large, framed illuminated address - was at the back of the stage and there were speeches, a presentation of a 'generous sum' which Chirgwin donated to the Variety Artistes' Benevolent Fund, and gifts of a specially-made instrument, a 'phono-fiddle', and a silver cigarette case.",
