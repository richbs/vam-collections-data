David often collects images for his paintings from magazines, and this print has the look of a collage, with a posing torso combined with other elements such as black circles and legs that are drawn in. This print takes elements from mainstream image-making and creates something unexpected and intriguing.\n\nThis print is included in a limited-edition box set of prints and photographs, published by SHOWstudio in 2001. The set consists of a range of works by a variety of people from the creative industries, from photographers to pop stars, and the works \u2013 a collection of art, artefacts and fashion ephemera \u2013 are exclusive to this set. The mix of media and creative practitioners involved in this portfolio reflects the interests of the SHOWstudio project, concerned with contemporary image-making, fashion and multimedia. It could be described as a time capsule or a modern archive.",
