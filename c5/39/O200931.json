When finished such fans would have been aimed at the cheaper end of the market and probably sold on the street. This fan leaf is uncut and it is possible to see quite clearly the brush strokes of the wash as it extends beyond the shape of the leaf. This fan shows signs of having been given a wash all over of silver 'dust' in solution, which has now oxidized to dirty grey, done by English fan makers to simulate Japanese mica papers, i.e. papers containing glittering specs of mica.",
