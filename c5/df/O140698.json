To explore ideas about mapping and route-finding, the artist used the colours of the lines from the classic tube map devised by Henry Beck (See E.816-1979). Gary Hume made an abstract grid pattern overlapped by circles in each of the colours representing the Underground lines.\n\nPlatform for Art, London Underground's art programme, commissions artists to create work for the travel network. This continues London Transport's tradition of commissioning artists to create publicity material. As part of this programme, some artists were invited to create covers for the London Underground pocket map.",
