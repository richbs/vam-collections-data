The stylized curves of this pattern were inspired by the Islamic architecture he studied on his journeys to Spain and Istanbul and Egypt. Jones regarded such geometrical Islamic designs, which combined a sense of flatness with interesting pattern, as particularly useful for wallpaper. This is typical Jones design, flat, formal and austere, but given a textural interest by the liberal use of light-reflecting gold paint.\n[Gill Saunders, 'British Design at Home', p.52]",
