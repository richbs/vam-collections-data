This interest in the exotic contributed to the development of the design style known as Art Deco. Art Deco artists and designers were also influenced by the African objects which had begun to appear in European homes and exhibitions. They attempted to replicate aspects of African design through using bold colour palettes and strong abstract or geometric patterns.\n\nThe Art Deco style was picked up by artists and designers in Britain where this sand-blasted glass panel was produced. In its bold design of a silhouetted African woman in profile, alongside a simplified strand of foliage, the panel typifies many of the features associated with Art Deco. Modern manufacturing techniques, such as those pioneered by Pilkington Glass, the maker of this piece, made the design style accessible to a broader range of people.",
