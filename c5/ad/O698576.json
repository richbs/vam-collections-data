            "bibliography": "<u>Victoria and Albert Museum Department of Prints and Drawings and Department of Paintings, Accessions 1963 </u>. London: HMSO, 1964.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:  \n  \n\"<b>PALMA, Jacopo (called Il Giovane) (1544-1628), and FRANCO (Giovanni) Battista (called Il Semolei) (c.1510-1580)</b> \n \n<i>De Excellentia et Nobilitate Delineationis Libri Duo</i>, first published by Giacomo Franco, Venice, 1611.  The first book, with studies of parts of the human figure, consists of etchings (14, including 1 on title-page) by Jacopo Palma, and engravings (13) by an anonymous artist after Jacopo Palma.  The second book, with various subjects mainly from Roman wall-paintings, reliefs and cameos. Consists of an etched frontispiece by Jacopo Palma and etchings and engravings (36) by Battista Franco, some which were probably re-worked by Giacomo Franco.  64 plates on 55 sheets, 4 pages of letterpress, with 2 initial letters, comprising a dedication to J. B. Duval, a discourse by Giacomo Franco and an epigram, quarter-bound in brown calf parchment boards. \n<i>The small plate appended to the etching on the title page lettered</i> Jacobus Palma fecit.  <i>The plates in the first book lettered (with variations)</i> Jacobus Franco Formis con Privilegio.  <i>The plates in the second book mostly lettered</i> Batista Franco fecit <i>and some</i> Franco Forma.  <i>Inscribed in ink inside the front and back covers with numbers. \nEtchings and engravings.  Various sizes. \nSize of volume</i> 35.9 x 25.4 cm.              E.901-964-1963 \n \n<i>Note:</i> Variations in the editions of this work are discussed by E. A. Cigogna in <i>Delle Inscrizione Veneziane</i>, 1842, Vol.5, pp.432-4.  Bartsch (B.2-27) lists 26 plates by Jacopo Palma from the edition of 1636, <i>Regole per imparar a disegnar i corpi humani\u2026</i> published by Marco Sadeler, including the two states of the frontispiece to the second book; he lists plates by Battista Franco, which appear in the second book of the present edition but does not associate them with the work.  Walther Heil in 'Palma Giovane als Zeichner', in <i>Jahrbuch der Preussischen Kunstsammlungen</i>, Vol.47, 1926, p.62, points out that Nagler and Bartsch were ignorant of the 1611 edition and states that some of the Palma plates were executed by Palma himself and others by another hand after his drawings.  \n \nH. Tietze and E. Tietze-Conrat in <i>The Drawings of the Venetian Painters</i>, New York, 1944, pp.197-8, relate the Jacopo Palma plates to a group of his drawings probably made about the year of the publication of the first edition, and assume that Giacomo Franco etched the plates.  They point out that Fialetti's <i>Il vero modo et ordine per Dissegnar tutte le Parti et Membra del Corpo Humano</i>, Venice, 1608, might have been a model for the work.  Most of the Battista Franco plates of animals and cameos appear to be related to engravings by Enea Vico in Lafreri's <i>Speculum Romanae magnificentiae</i>, an example of which is in the Department of  Prints and Drawings, E.3578-3706-1906.  The cameos depicted by Vico are reversed in the Franco plates. \n \nA copy of the present edition, in the Library of the Print Room at the Uffizi, Florence, was included in the exhibition of drawings of Jacopo Palma held at the Uffizi in 1958 (No.67 in the catalogue). \n \nEtchings by Jacopo Palma: \n \nTitle-page: A male and a female figure emblematic of Sculpture and Painting.  (B.17) \nE.901-1963\"",
