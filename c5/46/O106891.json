He advised on valuations and acted as agent on behalf of the Museum.  From the 1850s until the late 1870s he sold numbers of highly important objects to the Museum, many of which are now among the 'star' objects of the collections.  In 1867 he lent the Museum a large number of objects, including the present one (Loan no. 106), from his stock, charging a rental of 5% of their estimated value.  Most of these objects had been purchased by the Museum by 1873, and 11 were gem-engravings acquired for what is now the Sculpture collection.  On his death Webb left money to the Museum in the form of a trust fund to be used for the purchase of objects.Ex Webb Collection",
