Organic, amoebic shapes like this were very popular during the 1950s, particularly in the USA, and can be found on textiles, in architecture, and as corporate logos as well as in furniture design. The boomerang shape suggests speed and modernity, and may have been inspired by the delta wings of contemporary fighter aircraft.  The three tiers of this table, each one a different shape, together form an oval and seem to radiate around an invisible centre point. It was manufactured by the Brown-Saltman company in South Gate in Los Angeles, California, and was one of several boomerang-inspired tables designed for them by John Keal.",
