He produced propaganda material for almost every ministry, and his gossiping cartoon characters injected welcome humour into propaganda posters in February 1940. Their popularity set a new tone for official mass communication. Despite an extended and illustrious career as a cartoonist, illustrator and commercial poster designer, it is probably for his 'Careless Talk Costs Lives' posters, issued by the Ministry of Information for display in public transport, that he is best known. Repetition was a characteristic feature of Fougasse's earlier cartoon style. In most of his 'Careless Talk' posters, multiple imagery plays ironically against the captions as a device to warn against the fundamental dangers of gossip.",
