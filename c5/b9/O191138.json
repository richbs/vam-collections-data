It was issued during the first free elections in Hungary following the collapse of communism. The poster displays two elements of the party\u2019s graphic identity designed by B\u00e9la Aba: the letters MDF (an abbreviation of the party\u2019s name) and the party logo, a stylized plant form derived from an ancient palmette motif. Aba kept this motif as a flat form in pure green, but later versions added red and white colours and developed the emblem into a tulip. Here it appears as a white negative on green background.  Both the palmette motif and the tulip appealed to the conservative voters because they are associated with old Hungarian cultural traditions. Stylized plant motives decorated the robes and arms of the Hungarian tribes that conquered the Carpathian Basin in the 9th century. The tulip is a characteristic motive of Hungarian folk art. The popularity of the logo was enhanced by rumour that it was invented by Levente Sz\u00f6r\u00e9nyi, a popular pop singer and composer. Aba did indeed use a sketch by Sz\u00f6r\u00e9nyi with whom he was friendly. However, the original drawing was profoundly modified by the designer. \n\nThe quote \u2018I would like to be your candidate\u2019 printed below the candidate\u2019s portrait, as if spoken by Dr. K\u00e1tay, is an unusual strategy. This informal gesture is as emotional as the text written in the green square: \u2018For the prosperity of our 11th district, for our city, for our country, for the Hungarian future.\u2019",
