As son of a ship\u2019s carver he began his career as a modeller in wax. He spent seven years in John Flaxman\u2019s studio, acknowledged as his favourite and most devoted pupil. He attended the Royal Academy Schools. He is the sculptor of the Nelson on Nelson's Column, of ca. half the sculpture for Marble Arch, some of the exterior work on Buckingham Palace, and a number of monuments in St Paul's and Westminster Abbey, just to name a few. The work that brought him fame was Eve at the Fountain first shown 1818 at the Royal Academy. From 1809 he worked for Rundell, Bridge and Rundell, goldmsiths to the royal family becoming their Chief Modeller and Designer following Flaxman's death in 1826.",
