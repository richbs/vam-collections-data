London: Published by Trustees of the Victoria and Albert Museum, 1987.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n\"ANONYMOUS\nThe Royal Procession, 1872\nLettered with captions and <i>THE ROYAL PROCESSION OF THE QUEEN TO St Paul's Cathedral on  TUESDAY FEBRUARY 27, 1872.  THE DAY APPOINTED FOR A GENERAL  THANKSGIVING OF H.R.H THE PRINCE OF WALES./London: G: INGRAM  41 Old Street, St Luke's</i>\nInscribed <i>Bought for 1d as an illustration of the procession 27/2/72 printed from  old woodblocks intended to represent the Lord Mayor's show RHSS</i>\nWoodcut coloured by hand.\n55.3 X 86cm\n13190.\n\nWoodcut is a technique quite often employed in popular prints, broadsheets etc. including the depiction of public spectacles.  Cheaply produced prints for sale on the street are a type of print likely to be encountered hand-coloured.  If the finest hand-coloured Gillrays, David Roberts lithographs, sporting and topographical aquatints are amongst the high points of hand-colouring, this print, for all its naive charm, is something of a nadir.  Four colours have been daubed on randomly with little effort even being made to follow the lines of the design.\nThe opportunism on the part of the publisher of this print is demonstrated not only by the hastily applied colouring but, as the staff member responsible for its inclusion in the collection has noted, by the fact that the blocks actually depict the Lord Mayor's Show.\"",
