He holds a BA from Brown University and an MFA in photography from Yale University.  A Natural Order  (Nazraeli Press, 2012) is his first book.\n\nThis compelling work is from A Natural Order, a series of photographs of people living \u2018off the grid\u2019 in communities that strive to be self-sufficient. Valarie and the Shadow is a representative image from the series: it is carefully composed and demonstrates the photographer\u2019s eye for light and colour.  Like the series as a whole, the photograph provides a glimpse into a lifestyle unfamiliar to most viewers, yet does so in a sensitive, non-voyeuristic manner.  The shadow in the foreground is somewhat ominous, yet the photograph suggests no clear narrative.  On a formal level, the image is a study of the universal photographic themes of light and shadow.",
