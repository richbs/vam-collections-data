This game is a computerized version of the popular board game, Cluedo, in which players take on a variety of characters and have to guess who murdered the victim, Dr. Black, where the murder took place and what weapon used. Cluedo was published by Virgin Games Ltd, a British video game publisher, for the Amstrad colour personal computer. The computer was one of three market leading home computers in the 1980s along with the Spectrum ZX and the Commodore 64. Virgin Games Ltd was formed in 1981 and became much larger after purchasing the budget label, Mastertronic in 1987. In 1994 it was renamed Virgin Interactive and is now part of the larger Virgin Group.",
