It is a strapless sheath of horizontally gathered taffeta.  There is a rear overskirt extended to form a drape or 'flying panel' from sides to waist.  This gives the impression of movement and volume whilst also retaining a sleek and elegant line.  The bodice is lined with crepe, padded and boned and fastens with a side metal zip. \n\nBlack was of enormous significance to Christian Dior.  He described it as 'the most popular and the most convenient and the most elegant of all colours.  And I say colour on purpose, because black may be sometimes just as striking as colour' (Christian Dior's Little Dictionary of Fashion, 1954).  Black was rarely absent from his collections, and he used it frequently to create the defining statements for his famous lines.",
