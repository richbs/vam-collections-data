Overlaid with two tabard-style peplums stemming from the waist with embroidered net with chenille and twisted thread and pearl beads, and an overskirt of chiffon caught up at the sides to reveal the satin underneath. The bodice is draped with net and chiffon, also embroidered as with the peplums, and with a deep square neckline filled in with pleated chiffon. The embroidery consists of five-petalled flowers, buds and leaves in the same colour as the ground. The flowers are connected by criss-cross bands of thick satinised thread and three lozenge-shaped panels at the hem.\n\nThe overskirt is caught up from the hem at each side by chiffon roses. The bodice is covered with net, including the short sleeves which are lined. The waist, bodice and sleeves are trimmed with embroidery. The bodice is closed at the centre back from the low neck to hip level with a series of press-studs and hooks and eyes. The neck line is square-shaped in front finishing in a shallow 'V' at the back. There is a small inserted vest back and front of fine pleated chiffon. The under bodice is made of silk and boned with three stays at the front and six at the back. There is a silk ribbon inside the waistline. The bodice is finished with a chiffon rosette at the centre back.",
