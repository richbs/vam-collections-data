One of the main features of this type of dress is the intricate knot and loop fastenings. In its earlier form, the modern <i>qipao</i> was relatively loose and comfortable, a symbol of simplicity and frugality. By the 1940s, under the influence of Western tailoring, the dress had become tailored to be much more form-fitting (and fashionable).",
