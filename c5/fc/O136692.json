Their traditional jewellery retains many medieval characteristics lost elsewhere.\n\nWomen throughout the Nordic region usually used clasps to fasten their traditional clothing, not buttons.  These clasps vary considerably by region.\n\nThis clasp is typical of the jewellery worn by Sami women in Lapland.  In the past, the Sami were nomadic herders, moving their flocks of deer seasonally across the extreme north of Norway, Sweden, Finland and parts of Russia.  Although many have now settled in villages, they often retain their traditional costume.  The women\u2019s costume included a decorative yoke, or collar, which was covered with small pieces of silver jewellery like this clasp. \n\nThe leaf shape of the clasp, and its pendants, are typical of jewellery from the northern Nordic region.  You can see it used on pendants from Iceland, as well as Sami jewellery. This clasp was bought by the donor in northern Norway, but it could equally well have been made in Sweden, or even Finland.",
