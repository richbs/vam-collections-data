The cover is decorated with a dolphin and a ship sailing the flag of France. It has been suggested that the box commemorates the birth of the 'dauphin' Louis in 1729, heir to the throne. \n\nThe miniatures of the king and queen may have been painted by Jean-Baptiste Mass\u00e9. He is recorded as supplying miniatures of the king for boxes intended as diplomatic gifts from 1720-26. However, by 1729-32, when this box was made, only Jean-Baptiste Ducanel, his lesser known contemporary is mentioned. \n\nThe gift of a gold box was a means for the monarch to reward an ambassador or courtier. The recipient might then return the box to the goldsmith in exchange for cash. The custom of giving boxes was common in the French, Prussian and Austrian courts at this date.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world\u2019s great decorative art collections, including silver,  mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
