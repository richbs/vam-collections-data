The frame is in solid mahogany, the seat rails veneered over beech.  The legs are of rectangular section,the back legs raked, the front legs continuing as arm supports, tapering outwards in width and terminating in a waisted socle and arched top.  The front faces of the front legs are carved with a recessed panel, with incurved scrolls top and bottom, and with hanging anthemion heads below each arm terminal.  The front legs terminate on small pad feet.  The square back is raked, the uprights a continuation of the back legs.  The arms are oval in section, tapering towards the back, the front edges carved with a scalloped collar just behind the junction with the front uprights, the junctions with the back carved with formalised lotus leaf.  All other members are of plain rectangular section, the front of the seats bowed in plan.  The returns of the back frame, seen from the back, show an inner section (2/3 of the depth) which appears to be veneer, held by several dowels.  The chairs are close upholstered in white taffeta woven with red satin stripes of varying widths, the back similarly lined, the fixing tacks covered with gimp ('basket weave' on a, lezarde on b).\n\nThe upholstery matches the covering of W.11A&B-1987.",

            "history_note": "One of a large number of pieces of French furniture, ceramics, metalwork, books and other decorative arts, from the Empire period and earlier, acquired in Paris by Charles Stuart (from 1828 1st Lord Stuart de Rothesay) (1779--1845). The Empire furnishings were probably purchased during his first period as ambassador to Paris (1815--1824), the earlier furnishings during his second embassy (1828--30). The Empire furnishings may have been intended for a London house. He acquired 4 Carlton House Terrace, where improvements were carried out from 1827 to 1831, and he moved in in 1834. Older furnishings were more probably purchased for his country house, Highcliffe Castle, Hampshire (now Dorset), which was remodelled and enlarged in the most ambitious Gothic style from 1830 to 1834, with some work continuing throughout the 1830s. In 1841 the house in Carlton House Terrace was let, and the family moved their London residence to Whitehall Yard. It was possibly at that time -- or in 1845, the date of Lord Stuart de Rothesay's death --  that the Empire furnishings were moved to Highcliffe. \nLord Stuart de Rothesay's collections were inherited in 1867 by his younger daughter Louisa, Lady Waterford (1818--1891), who maintained Highcliffe Castle. She left the house and its collections to her distant cousin Major-General Edward Stuart Wortley (1857--1934). When his younger daughter Elizabeth ('Bettine') married Montagu Bertie, 8th Earl of Abingdon, in 1928, he bought the castle and its contents from his father-in-law. The Abingdons sold Highcliffe and most of its contents in 1949, but retained the present group of furniture and some other pieces. After her husband's death in 1963, Lady Abingdon lived for much of the time with her close friends Mr and Mrs Tahu Hole, to whom she bequeathed all her personal possessions on her death in 1978. Tahu Hole died in 1985, and a year later his widow Joyce approached the Museum and offered the collection as a bequest. She died in December 1986, and in accordance with her will the Museum chose those items that it wished to add to its collections. Other items from the collection were sold to benefit the Museum, and the proceeds added to the funds bequeathed.\n\nHistorical significance: This chair and its pair (W.6A-1987) are strong in design though without gilt-bronze mounts, in the manner often deployed by Demay. A fauteuil in the Louvre with exactly the same design of front uprights in one piece (the legs rising through the seat to form the arm-supports), based on the design of antique swords, is stamped by Jacob-Desmalter and labelled for the Tuileries. (See Serge Grandjean, <I>Empire Furniture</I> (1966), pl. 32.) \nA matching chair, also stamped by Demay, from the estate of Lady Abingdon, was sold at Christie's, London, 10 December 1987, lot 95.",
