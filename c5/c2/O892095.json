Dimsdale and E. Durand (according to a note in the departmental registry; but there are no collector's marks); Dalton Bequest 1900 LITERATURE &lt;i&gt;Dalton Catalogue&lt;/i&gt;, p. 22 (as anonymous) The theme and the handling are somewhat reminiscent of Mola. The drawing may be a copy after him. There is some writing on the back, partly in French, partly in Italian, in different hands. The sentences are strung together as though at random, and have no connection with the drawing.",
