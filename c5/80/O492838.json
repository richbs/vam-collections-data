            "public_access_description": "The netsuke is a toggle. Japanese men used netsuke to suspend various pouches and containers from their sashes by a silk cord. Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. Above all they had to have the means of attaching the cord. In this example, there are a pair of holes (himotoshi) on the bottom of the sandal.  Although netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated is the katabori (shape carving). This is a three- dimensional carving, such as this netsuke.\n\nFrom the 18th century onwards, many more makers signed their netsukes. This example is signed Masatoshi. Masatoshi was an artist from the Nagoya school who carved both netsuke and inro. This netsuke is an imaginative piece with the octopus sat within a broken jar covered with barnacles. The rounded forms of both the octopus and the vase assisted in the functionality of the netsuke by preventing it from catching on clothing. The brightness of the eyes also draws the attention of the wearer to the creature's pursed mouth and alert expression.",
