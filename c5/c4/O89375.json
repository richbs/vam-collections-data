It was registered during the period when he was preoccupied with designing 'Kidderminster' type flat-woven carpets, also made for him by the Heckmondwike Manufacturing Company in Yorkshire. In the twentieth century 'Tulip and Rose' was available as powerloom-woven silk and linen, and silk and cotton mixed fabrics, and recommended for seat upholstery in wool.\n\nIn 1875 Morris founded his company Morris & Co.,  producing textiles commercially for sale in two London shops. Morris was the artist and designer who was the greatest single influence on the Arts and Crafts Movement and the most successful textile designer and manufacturer of his day. Morris revived the craft of block printing and vegetable dyeing and in his own home he set up looms for tapestry weaving and the hand knotting of carpets. He was highly influenced by historical patterns and was one of the most knowledgeable textile historians of the late 19th century.",
