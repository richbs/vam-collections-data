His design for a recruitment poster was initially rejected by the War Office as too explicitly horrific, but it drew huge numbers of recruits and was reprieved. (He was later commissioned by the US Government to design a recruiting poster when America entered the war in 1917.) The design for Put Strength in the Final Blow . . ., commissioned toward the end of the conflict by the National War Savings Committee, invited the viewer's contribution to the fight by placing him in the position of the British soldier, and thereby expressed very powerfully how the money from War Bonds could assist toward the final victory. Such was the impact of the poster that the German emperor, Wilhelm II, is said to have a put a price on Brangwyn's head.",
