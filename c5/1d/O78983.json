It was probably made from an illustration of the Wells chair rather than as a measured copy because there are numerous small differences in the turnings and construction.  When it was made, probably in the 1830s, there was a growing market for furniture from earlier centuries, both genuine and copies.  This one appears to have been a copy, rather than a fake intended to deceive.\n\nTime\nIn 1913, when this chair was given to the V&A, it was thought to be a genuine 17th-century example.  It was not until the 1970s, when it was closely examined, that curators found drill holes which could only have been made with a 19th-century drill, and realised that the chair must date from about 1830-1840.\n\nPeople\nThe chair may have been made for sale by Mr Kensett, a London furniture broker, because he is mentioned by name in a book published in 1833, the Encyclopaedia of Cottage, Farm and Villa Architecture and Furniture by John Claudius Loudon (1783-1843). Mentioning the celebrated chair at the Bishop's Palace at Wells, Loudon reports that 'correct copies ... are manufactured by Mr Kensett for sale'.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe chair is in the tradition of three-legged chairs made from turned parts dowelled together, which were made in Northern Europe from the 1500s.  Turning (shaping wood with a chisel while turning it on a lathe) is an ancient technique.",

They are usually accepted as being a rustic survival of the traditional mediaeval chair seen in illuminated manuscripts, in which a memory of the Byzantine form of furniture obscurely persisted.
