            "public_access_description": "Mieke Groot has been one of the leading glass makers in the Netherlands for several decades. She uses complicated multi-layered enamel techniques on simple blown vase forms.\nHelmut Ricke, former Director of the Kunstmuseum, D\u00fcsseldorf, has characterised her work:\n'Mieke Groot is concerned with the vase as a timeless, \"classical\" carrier of expression and meaning.... The artist has placed all of her emphasis on the exterior, the shell of the undefined inner life. The enamel, applied in layers and fired in several stages, develops the cracked and torn structure that makes the objects so fascinating\". (in: The Glass Skin, Corning, Hokkaido, D\u00fcsseldorf, 1998, p.60)\nIn most of Mieke's works of the first decade of the 21st century, the shiny transparent glass surface is almost completely covered with an enamel skin. The V&amp;A has an example of this period in the collection, dating from 2002 (C.37-2002).\nIn her latest work Mieke has allowed larger areas of the glass to remain transparent. With its simple shapes and strong, geometrical decorations this work harks back to Dutch design from the early 20th century, such as Leerdam glass from the 1920s and 30s and the aesthetics of the 'de Stijl' movement around Gerrit Rietveld and Theo van Doesburg.",
