Each of the four corners of the filigree settings have a circular-cut paste 'diamond'.  Attached to lower links joining the central trefoil to the rectangular shapes on either sides, is 1 circular white metal 'flower' set with a central paste 'diamond', from which hangs a square cut pendant paste 'diamond'.  To the right and left of the rectangular filigree settings are more links attaching a smaller oval white metal setting set with 1 square-cut paste 'diamond', in turn attached to a plain-set paste 'diamond' without a filigree surround.  From this, on either side is a row of paste 'diamonds', originally 20 on the left side (as worn), and 20 on the right side (as worn).",
