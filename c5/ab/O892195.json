Volume II. 17th-18th century</u>, London, 1979, p. 98 The following is the full text of the entry: Christ and four disciples on a hill with a view of a town in the distance Inscribed on the back, in ink in an 18th century hand 'Lapi' (?) and 'Franceschi'; and again on the back of the mount in pencil in a more recent hand 'Franceschi, From the Coil. of Mr. Charles Jourdeuil' Pen and ink and wash 8 \u00be x 6 \u00be (222 x 171) D.992-1900 PROVENANCE C. Jourdeuil (Lugt 528); Dalton Bequest 1900 LITERATURE &lt;i&gt;Dalton Catalogue&lt;/i&gt;, p. 11 (as by Paolo Franceschi) Formerly ascribed to Paolo dei Franceschi (Pauwels Franck), doubtless on account of the inscription on the back. It is not certain, however, that the inscription refers to this rare artist; nor does the drawing bear any resemblance in style to the few drawings which have been convincingly attributed to him (Tietze and Tietze-Conrat no. 693, pI. 129; H. G. Franz, &lt;i&gt;Niederldndische Landschaftsmalerei im zeitalter des Manierismus&lt;/i&gt;, Graz, 1969, 1,300-03 and 2, pIs. 445, 446). The drawing is more Roman than Venetian. For another drawing unconvincingly ascribed to Paolo dei Franceschi, see no. 855.",
