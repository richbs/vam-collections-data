The edges of the wide, deep neckline, the rounded half collar, the front skirt opening and the cuffs of the long, curving sleeves are trimmed with narrow, pleated cream silk ribbon. It has a closed stomacher bodice with a low wide square neck with a triangular collar behind, and also long tight sleeves fastening at the wrist with 3 buttons. The wide stomacher, curving to a shallow point, has been reversed to form the bodice front. The bodice was formerly boned, and has a centre back seam with closely spaced side back seams. The skirt is open fronted with a round waist and flat pleating over the bodice. The bodice is lined with white linen. It was pointed at the back, but the skirt, which is pleasted from the side to an inverted pleat at the centre, was raised tio a higher waist level, completely covering this point. The neck, cuffs and the sides of the skirt are trimmed with gathered cream silk ribbon. The bodice is lined with linen and the back of the hem is faced in silk. It is possible that in 1793 the waist was shortened, with the skirt repleated over the bodice and the sleeves being let out under the arms.",

            "historical_context_note": "The vendor had inherited this item from a Welsh branch of the family called Nannan, and it was traditionally said to have belonged to a lady in waiting to Queen Anne. It had been packed away wth a petticoat and apron which had always been thought to have belonged to it. This apron is remembered to have been of thick taffeta, about 3 yds around the hem, gathered into a waist band and fastened with small buttons. This was about 3 yards in circumference around the hem, was primrose yellow and had a small design of Prince of Wales feathers about 1/4' 2\" apart in all directions. The apron was probably called an 'abigail' though unfortunately both apron and petticoat were destroyed.",
