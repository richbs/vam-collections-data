The horse looks like it is a shire instead of a thoroughbred and the humour appears to stem from this. It has large feet and both the horse's and the rider's faces have comic expressions. The whole is cast in two halves along the length and held by tongue and slot joints. The whole is mounted on a base by a metal support under the chest with one hind leg attached to the base. The base is orange metal and is iteself mounted on a red metal block supported by the clockwork mechanism; two large grey metal wheels and a small front wheel. The front wheel swivels allowing some erratic movement when operated. The winding key is integral; attached to the mechanism at the rear and extending beyond the end of the horse. \n*The mark GERMANY is on the rear left leg and there are no other marks.",
