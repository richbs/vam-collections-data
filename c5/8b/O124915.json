            "public_access_description": "Great Britain\u2019s leading theatre designer from the early 1930s to the mid 1950s, Oliver Messel (1904-1978) won international acclaim for his lavish, painterly and poetic designs informed by period styles.  His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nHomage to the Queen, a Sadler's Wells Ballet production choreographed by Frederick Ashton (1904-1988), celebrated the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II on 2 June, 1953. The ballet featured a procession of the four elements, earth, water, fire and air and an apotheosis.    The formal, courtly theme inspired Messel to produce lavish, fantastical designs inspired by Jacobean court ballets or masques, in the manner of Inigo Jones (1573-1672). \n\nMessel\u2019s debt to Inigo Jones (1573-1652), the architect and designer of court entertainments and masques in seventeenth century England, is most evident in the male ballet costumes.   The ballet critic Richard Buckle called Messel \u2018an artist in the great tradition of Inigo Jones, adept at producing effects of splendour, fantasy and romance.\u2019  ( Observer, 7 June 1953).",
