A garage is attached to the left of the house, with a green door painted to simulate a slatted effect. The back of the house is painted white. On the bottom of the inside of the door a paper cut out of a black cat drinking milk from a blue bowl, set against a yellow background. The basic colour of the house is cream with decorative lines painted around the windows, door and gable. The door is green and has a pattern of three vertical lines on the lower half which is characteristic of a Wagner house. The windows are of pressed card and have square mullions and the original cream lace curtains. The grey mottled effect on the base, porch and gable is also characteristic of a Wagner house. Green shrubbery has been stencilled or painted on the front and each side of the house. There is a bay window to the right and three rooms inside; two small rooms on the upper level and a long one on the lower level. The floor and wall coverings appear to be original with brown tile effect flooring on both levels and floral motif on the walls on the lower floor. The roof is fixed.",

It has a garage which was an exciting modern addition to the house because people were only just beginning to buy cars. Few examples have survived in good condition as they were played with a great deal. This one was acquired by Mrs Marcia Gore who looked after it for many years. It was given to the museum by her husband after she died.",
