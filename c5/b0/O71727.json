            "public_access_description": "This ring belonged to William Wytlesey who was consecrated Bishop of Rochester in 1362, was transferred to the Bishopric of Worcester in 1364, and was Archbishop of Canterbury between 1368 and his death in 1374. It is said to have been found in his tomb.  It seems that bishops frequently chose sapphires for their rings.  Of 20 rings found in the graves of English medieval bishops, twelve are sapphires.  A bishop receives a ring at his consecration and wears a ring as a symbol of his office.  We do not know whether this ring was William Wytlesey's consecration ring, or one of a number of rings which he owned.\nSapphires were believed to be particularly suited to bishops because of their heavenly colour. They were thought to expel envy, comfort the heart, detect fraud and witchcraft and obtain esteem from the wearer's lord. The hole drilled through the sapphire was believed to increased its power or 'virtue'.",
