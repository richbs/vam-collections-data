For him, truth to nature consisted of accurately recreating the depth and density of space and atmosphere. Most of his pictures were taken in East Anglia in the 1880's, and his studies of landscapes, people at work, and scenes from daily life survive in the form of seven illustrated books, including 'Life and Landscape of the Norfolk Broads' and 'On English Lagoons'.",
