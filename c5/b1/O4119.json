Unlike the later 'sweetmeat' glasses, these early prototype examples are extremely rare.\n\nOwnership & Use\nBy the 1680s English lead glass was freely available in London. Heavy glass was still very expensive, although lightweight objects like this piece would have been relatively cheap. However, the ownership of dessert glasses at this period implies an interest in sophisticated dining and a certain degree of wealth. As glass, particularly cut-glass, became  increasingly popular on the dining table towards the end of the 18th century, so pyramids of salvers, loaded with jelly or ice-cream glasses and topped with a heavier version of this glass, became a common sight.",
