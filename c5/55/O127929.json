            "public_access_description": "This unusual sculpture stands out, firstly as a Chinese depiction of an Indian figure, and secondly because of its large size and bright colours. The figure is Bodhidharma, a Buddhist monk who is believed to have travelled from India to China in 520, bringing meditational Buddhism with him. From his furrowed brow and closed eyes, we can tell that he is deep in meditation. He sits on a pedestal integral to the sculpture, with apertures for easy handling on either side and an inscription that records the date and donors, 'faithful Dang Yan and Madam Mai'.",

London: V&A Publishing, 2008, pp. 62-63.\nMasterpieces entry\nThis life-size temple sculpture represents Bodhidharma, an Indian Buddhist monk who came to China in AD 520 and founded the Chan (Zen) sect of Buddhism.\n\nCeramic religious figures have the advantage over their wooden counterparts, though making and successfully firing this exceptional large one must have posed formidable technical challenges to the potter. Such sculptures were offered by faithful Buddhist, who paid for their manufacture, and these specially commissioned pieces often bear an inscription to commemorate the occasion. On this figure the inscription is incised on the right-hand side of the pedestal, giving a date equivalent to 1484: \"Chenghua 20th year, faithful Dang Yan and Madam Mai. Priest Dao Ji. Craftsman Liu Zhen\".\n\nBy a historical coincidence, three other Buddhist figures with similar inscriptions dated 1484 survived in the UK. This suggests that in this year the Buddhist priest Dao Ji persuaded several families to donate money towards the production of ceramic sculptures, the occasion probably being the completion of a new temple. Unlike other ceramics, religious figures of this size seldom changed hands and, once installed in a temple, under normal circumstances they would remain there. During the 1930s, however, when China was experiencing political turmoil, these four figures were shipped to the UK for sale on the art market. Bodhidharma was given to the V&A by the London dealer John Sparks in 1937 because the figure had been damaged in transit, thus difficult to sell. The other three are now in the British Museum, the Burrell Collection, Glasgow, and the Lady Lever Art Gallery, Liverpool.",
