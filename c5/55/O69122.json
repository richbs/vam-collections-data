            "public_access_description": "This scene of carpet weavers was sketched by the English artist John Lockwood Kipling (1837-1911) in 1870, probably in the jail at Amritsar, in the Panjab. Kipling was a potter in Staffordshire before studying art in the Schools at South Kensington. In 1865 he went to India to become Architectural Sculptor at the Bombay School of Art. From 1875 to 1893 he lived in Lahore, and was Principal of the Mayo School of Art, and Curator of the Central Museum, in the city. He was fascinated by the vast range of skills to be seen in India and made a large number of detailed drawings documenting them. The jail at Amritsar, about 30 km from Lahore, was a major centre of carpet weaving in the region in the late 19th century, when the commercial carpet-weaving industry was in decline. Kipling has included tools such as the beater for compacting the wefts (on the left of the left-hand weaver), a short knife with a curled blade for cutting off the excess wool when the knots are tied on the warps, and the large scissors used to trim the pile when the rug is complete (both behind the right-hand weaver). \nThe drawing was acquired by the Indian Museum in London and was transferred with other parts of the museum's collections to the South Kensington Museum (later renamed the Victoria and Albert Museum) in 1879.\nJohn Lockwood Kipling (1837-1911) was born in Yorkshire but as his career developed became an established artist and scholar, and in 1865 settled in India with his family. He became professor of architectural sculpture at the JeeJeebhay School of Art in Bombay and in 1882 curator of the Lahore Museum. During his career JL Kipling was a member of the Department of Art and Science at the Victoria and Albert Museum and was also involved in the museum's decoration. John Lockwood Kipling was the father of Rudyard Kipling.",
