            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nBack-to-back writing tables became fashionable during the reign (1727-1760) of George II. Together they formed a large centre-table for a library.  The elaborate profile and mounts indicate that these tables were also a fashion statement. As such they could be used separately in bedrooms or dressing rooms for storing personal belongings as well as writing equipment.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThis table has a long well-fitted desk drawer with a writing slide which pulls forward on corner-truss supports. This concept was developed by Thomas Chippendale in 1760 and published in the third edition of The Gentleman and Cabinet Maker's Director (1762) as plate 82. The elaborate curved front of the table is also close to a 1761 design for a cabinet published by Chippendale in 1762 as plate 122.\n\nPlace\nA description of 'Two Library tables ... of the most elegant construction and exquisitie workmanship' sold at Fonthill Splendens in 1801 has been linked with the V&A table and its pair, which was sold at auction in New York in 2000. The huge Palladian mansion of Fonthill Splendens in Wiltshire was built for Alderman William Beckford (1709-1770), father of the wealthy collector William Beckford (1760-1844). The elder Beckford was also known for his extravagant taste, and is likely to have expressly commissioned such elaborate furniture as this writing table. (The younger Beckford was later to sell off some of Fonthill Splendens's contents - apparently including this table - prior to demolishing the house in 1807 and replacing it with the neo-Gothic Fonthill 'Abbey'.)",

ISBN 1851773088.\nThis bombastic piece is linked, though without firm documentary evidence, with the famous Fonthill Splendens, Wiltshire, the sumptuous Palladian mansion built by Alderman William Beckford (1709-1770) between 1757 and 1770. Beckford's son William (1760-1844), one of the most significant of early-nineteenth-century collectors, demolished his father's house in 1805, and in 1796-1807 built on the family property the Gothic Revival extravaganza he called Fonthill Abbey, designed by James Wyatt. Family tradition, a description in Gentleman's Magazine (1801) of \"Two library tables . . . of the most elegant construction and exquisite workmanship\" sold in the 1801 Fonthill sale, and furniture mentioned in John Britton's account of an unnamed Wiltshire house identifiable as Fonthill Splendens all lead to an association between Beckford and these extravagant pieces of furniture.\nThe V&A's commode was probably sold with its mate at the first Fonthill sale in 1801, though the pair, it was reported, \"hardly brought one half of what was expected of them.\" By the 1950s, such richly decorated objects were even more unfashionable than they had been in 1801. The commode was first associated with the cabinetmaker John Channon in 1966 when his signed brass-inlaid bookcases from Powderham Castle, Devon, 1740, became the key to the attribution of a group of mid-eighteenth-century English brass-inlaid furniture. Like the Powderham bookcases, the V&A commode is embellished with dolphin mounts; as a dolphin forms part of the crest of the Courtenay family, this led to speculation that the commode was made for the same patron as the bookcases, Sir William Courtenay (1709-1762). The dolphin link became tenuous, however, when the carved dolphin mounts on the Powderham bookcase plinths were recently found to be nineteenth-century additions.\nThe design of the commode is more sophisticated than the Powderham bookcases. Research undertaken for the recent exhibition \"John Channon and Brass-Inlaid Furniture\" uncovered seven other cabinetmakers whose workshops were producing brass-inlaid furniture in the mid-eighteenth century. Still, in the absence of more complete documentation, the authorship of this commode and related pieces remains uncertain.\n\nLit.
