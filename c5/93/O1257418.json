David Kirkness established it as the most popular Orkney type in the 1890s. His workshop in Kirkwall, Orkney, made frames from pine or oak ordered from Aberdeen rather than local driftwood. He sent finished frames to skilled locals who wove the straw directly onto them. \n\nThis Orkney chair, which has belonged to the University of St Andrew's for over a century, appears in a photograph of the Dining Room at University Hall in Kennedy Gardens taken between 1896 and 1910. Of the many thousands of chairs made in Kirkness's workshop, it is one of very few that still retains its original label.",
