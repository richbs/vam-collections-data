Catalogue of the exhibition held at the Victoria and Albert Museum, June-September 1970.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n'Sir Henry Cole KCB (1808-82)\n<b>Drawing of a parcel of records in the Old Record Office showing the state in which  historical records were being preserved in about 1827</b>\nWatercolour\nE.5883-1910\n\nAt the end of the Jarndyce Chancery suit, the estate is entirely absorbed in legal  costs. All that is left is paper. From the court 'great bundles of paper began to be  carried out - bundles in bags, bundles too large to be got into any bags, immense  masses of papers of all shapes and no shapes. The Lord Chancellor is balanced in  the novel by a parody Lord Chancellor: Krook, the rubbish merchant, whose shop is  full of ancient documents that he cannot read. It was evidently Dickens's conviction  that the country's legal system was clogged with waste paper. Curiously, the legal  and other public records of the country were treated almost as waste paper. Sir  Henry Cole conducted a vigourous campaign to improve the condition of the Public  Records, pointing out in an article in the Westminster Review (1849) that the  Chancery records were dumped in the Tower of London along with gunpowder and  ordnance stores, while the Common Law records were kept in the stables of Carlton  House. These and other equally strange depositories were replaced, as a result of Cole's efforts, by a new fireproof repository in 1851.'",
