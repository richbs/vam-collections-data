There are no doors on the front or back of the house. The interior is divided up into four rooms - a bedroom, a living room, a dinning room and a kitchen. There is a veranda on both sides of the house with open railings to provide extra ventilation. Windows in house are also positioned to throughout the house to provide maximum ventilation.
