Short is holding a figure of Mr. Punch while Codlin carries the pan pipes that he plays in the book.\n\nCharles Dickens was fond of Punch and Judy. Today Punch and Judy shows are a feature of British seaside entertainment whose history in Great Britain stretches back to the puppet show that Samuel Pepys first noted seeing in Covent Garden on 9 May 1662 performed by the Italian puppeteer Signor Bologna.",
