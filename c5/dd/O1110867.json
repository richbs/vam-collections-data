He described Duncan at the Thalia Theatre. 'At Breslau where she danced more perfectly than ever with more care more freedom more love there they [the audience] sat still & stupid....An ugly little theatre full of ugly & foolish people & on the darkened stage a figure growing at each movement more perfect - lavishing beauty on each side of her as a sower sows rich corn in a brown & ugly field - poems glitter and shimmer all round her, floating in the air with her waiting to be flung out into the air never to return - all there waiting.'\nThe German listing of the prints in the Insel-Verlag portfolio in which this image is reproduced as No.5 indicates Isadora was performing a dance to music by Strauss but in the English version listing (which probably corrects the German) indicates this was a dance to music by Beethoven.",
