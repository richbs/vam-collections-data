Within the foot are six vertical strips added during repairs. The hexagonal shaft terminates in hexagonal punched wires; the knop is melon shaped and chased with segments, three of which are engraved with flower heads. The base of the bowl is clasped by a shaped calyx, with alternate petals, cross hatched. A contemporary inscription under the foot- ring reads ' COK ME FIERI FECIT ANNO DOMINI 1590' there is also a later inscription 'The Mount Keefe Chalice - reconsecrated Burton Park AD 1916'. This chalice was made by an Irish goldsmith for mass use according to the Roman Catholic rite. In common with most contemporary Irish liturgical plate, it bears no goldsmith's marks but there is a dedicatory inscription recording that it was made to the order of C.O.K, probably a member of the O'Keefe family, in 1590.",

The ceremony took place in the private chapel at Burton.\n\nHistorical significance: The prominence given to the shamrock leaf, an ancient religious symbol in Ireland, is unusual. By 1600 the association of the shamrock with St. Patrick had widened from its purely religious associations and the shamrock had become a national emblem for Ireland. Irish chalices are distinct from  contemporary chalices made in England for recusant use which are normally quite plain, rarely bear any inscriptions or date and are often constructed in three parts for concealment and convenience when travelling.",

Catholics who refused to attend Church of England services were known as recusants and until the late 17th century they had to worship in secret. However, the Dukes of Norfolk and aristocratic families such as the Arundells at Wardour Castle encouraged Catholic communities to use their private chapels and so kept the faith alive.\n\nThe Catholic plate that survives from before the 1660s is mainly limited to chalices, paxes and pyxes. These earlier pieces are rarely marked. After 1688, Catholic plate was more often hallmarked and the range of forms expanded to include sanctuary lamps, cruets and incense boats. \n\nIn London, Catholics could worship openly in foreign embassy chapels. The silver from the Sardinian Embassy chapel can be seen in the case to the right. During the reign of Charles II, Catholic courtiers could also attend the queen's private chapel and that of the Queen Mother, Henrietta Maria.",
