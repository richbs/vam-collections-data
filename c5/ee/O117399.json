The axe is extremely heavy, and the weight is greater towards the end to made the downward thrust more effective, meaning that the sacrifice could more easily be performed in one movement. \nIt may have been made in Ranaghat in Nadia District, Bengal. The neighbourhood of ironsmiths (Kamarpara) in Ranaghat at one time housed prosperous smithies and forges as cottage industries. The axe was bought from the Annual International Exhibition of 1872 in London by the Indian Museum. It was transferred with much of the museum's collections to the South Kensington Museum, later renamed the Victoria and Albert Museum, in 1879.",

The axes in the exhibition would probably have been similar to the ones seen by Fanny Parks. They are both extremely heavy, the weight being greater towards the end so that the downward thrust would be easier and the sacrifice could be performed in one movement. Examples of axes can be seen on some of the paintings in the exhibition items 109, 115 and an animal sacrifice is shown on the Manasa 'pat' no.57.\nPublished: Egerton [1896] p.102, no.350 and pl.IX (line drawing), Rawson [1967] pl.43.
