The names of the artists appear alongside references to their works with a food theme. They are not necessarily the actual titles of these works, as Davies recounts them with irreverent humour. While Martha Rosler is known for her performative piece Semiotics of the Kitchen, John Latham's act of eating a book by the famous art critic Clement Greenberg at a dinner party is referred to as stupid fucker ate some book. With this lithograph, Davies pays ironic homage to the works of other artists. This print was a part of a set published by the Space Studios in London in 2002. The book Space Cooks included works by 103 leading contemporary artists, all inspired by food.",
