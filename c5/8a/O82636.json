This development allowed every part of the wick to be equally exposed to the air, letting the wick burn evenly and more brightly.  With a conventional wick, the thicker it became, the more difficult it became for it to burn at the centre.\n\nTrading\nMatthew Boulton (1728-1809) was introduced to Argand in 1784 by William Packer, a Birmingham merchant.  Argand had only provisionally patented his design through not having sufficient funds to take out a full patent.  Boulton, a natural entrepreneur, was fascinated by the ingenuity of Argand's invention and put into production lamps made in Sheffield plate incorporating Argand's design for the wick.  But Boulton failed to finance a full patent application and his relationship with Argand ended acrimoniously.\n\nPeople\nThe stem of this lamp is engraved with the Arms of Charles William Stewart, 1st Baron Stewart, later 3rd Marquess of Londonderry (died 1854) encircled with the collar of the Order of the Bath.  It is most unusual to be able to date closely any piece of Sheffield plate, but since Stewart became Baron Stewart in 1814 and was created Viscount Seeham in 1823, this lamp must have been made between these dates.",
