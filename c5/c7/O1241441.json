Beatrix and her family first holidayed at Wray Castle (built 1845), Windermere, in the summer of 1882 after previously taking holidays in Scotland. This was Potter's first proper introduction to the Lake District. \n\nBeatrix\u2019s skilful and sensitive sketching of the castle and its surrounding landscape drew the attention of Canon Hardwicke Drummond Rawnsley, whose family owned Wray Castle. He had clear views about campaigning to preserve the unspoilt landscape and heritage of the region and was instrumental in setting up the National Trust in 1895. Rawnsley's conversations with Beatrix influenced her later conservational pursuits.\n\nBeatrix Potter (1866-1943) is one of the world's best-loved children's authors and illustrators. She wrote the majority of the twenty-three original Peter Rabbit books between 1901 and 1913. The Tale of Peter Rabbit (Frederick Warne, 1902) is her most famous and best-loved tale.",
