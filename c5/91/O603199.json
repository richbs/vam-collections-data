Launched in 1798, she served during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, mostly on blockades or convoy escort duties. She fought only one fleet action, the Battle of Trafalgar, but became so well known for her actions and her subsequent depictions in art and literature that she has been remembered as \"The Fighting Temeraire\". Her last action was against the French off Toulon, when she came under fire from shore batteries. The ship returned to Britain in 1813 for repairs, but was laid up. She was converted to a prison ship and moored in the River Tamar until 1819. Further service brought her to Sheerness as a receiving ship, then a victualling depot, and finally a guard ship. The Admiralty ordered her to be sold in 1838, and she was towed up the Thames to be broken up. This final voyage was depicted in an oil painting of the same year by J. M. W. Turner and was greeted with critical acclaim. Entitled <i>The Fighting Temeraire tugged to her last Berth to be broken u</i><i>p</i>, the painting continues to be held in high regard, voted Britain's favourite painting in 2005 by listeners of BBC Radio 4.",
