They had a plain collar buttoned at the neck and usually had slits up the side that were often reinforced with gussets to allow the wearer to move easily. They were generally made of cotton or linen.\n\nUntil the middle of the 19th century nightshirts were often worn together with a nightcap. By the 1860s these had gone out of fashion for the younger generation.\n\nDuring the 1880s pyjamas began to replace the nightshirt. Pyjamas originated in India. The outfit consisted of a jacket and trousers made of wool or silk in various colours. By the 1890s the nightshirt was totally out of fashion. The Tailor and Cutter of 1897 reported: 'The doom of the sleeping shirt is written. Those possessed of any ought to preserve them carefully so that they can show to succeeding generations the wonderfully and fearfully made garments their forefathers slept in.... The pyjama sleeping suit is to take its place\u2026of oriental origin, of silks, etc, generally striped.'",
