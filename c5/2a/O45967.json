The strip is embroidered with narrow bands of geometrical patterns and conventional animals and birds, mainly in dark blue cotton; occasional bands are in mauve cotton, magenta silk, yellow silk and the last three alternately.\n\n1975 Description: Huipil panel.  The bird motifs on this panel are upside down on the upper half, but if worn as a 'poncho' with the shoulder fold across the middle then all the motifs are upright.  It is one panel of a two-panelled, or perhaps three- panelled Indian blouse (huipil) from the town of Quetaltenango. The white ground cloth is basket weave, loosely woven.  Double-faced brocade weaving patterns almost cover the ground in the middle section (this technique is also called onlay, laid-in, loom embroidery etc).  The pattern threads are magenta and yellow floss silk in three areas and mauve and dark blue cotton in the other areas. Pattern yarns are used with several strands together in each pick so the pattern stands out thickly from the ground cloth.  This piece has three selvedges and was woven on a backstrap loom (on the end selvedge one can see where the warp threads were leashed on to the loom's end stick).",

Huipils are hand-woven by the women themselves, usually on a portable 'back-strap' or 'belt' loom, which is secured around the waist of the weaver, enabling her to continue weaving when opportunity and time permit. Huipils are very simply constructed; they consist of a woven cotton or wool rectangle with an opening left at the top for the head, much like a tunic. The weave is either plain or brocaded, which can then be embroidered or appliqu\u00e9d if further decoration is desired. Patterns are often particular to the weaver's village or region and are therefore a useful clue to the huipil's origins.",
