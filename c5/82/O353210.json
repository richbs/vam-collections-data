Very fine, buff, silk warp with wefts of red, light blue, dark blue, light green, dark green silks and undyed linen (z-spun). The fabric has continuous colourful stripes across it. The brown leather strips are 2mm wide and some sign of gilding remains. The leather sits along the middle of a stripe of dark blue silk. The linen lining is plain weave; undyed; approx. 23 x 23 tpc. Some bad staining is present with some holes. There is a separate small square of plain, roughly woven, stained linen attached to the side of the cap.\n\nThe construction is much like 1099-1900 but only half the cap remains. The cover has been  hemmed onto a thin band/strip of undyed linen (approx. 7mm wide). On the outer side, a running stitch, in undyed, linen thread, can be seen to run through the middle of this band, all the way around.  On the inner side the band has been sewn onto the lining with a whip stitch using blue, linen thread. The undyed linen thread of the outer, running stitch can be seen. Two parallel lines of  running stitch go around the edge of the cap (in blue, linen thread). Along  the centre of the lining are four, parallel  lines of stitching in blue linen thread in a running  stitch. Two one  either side of the centre, 3mm  between each line. These lines end approx. 20mm  before the edge of  the cap. It is possible that  these threads could be  pulled to tighten the cap for  a closer fit? A small portion of what would have been a linen tie remains on one side. It is sewn to the cap with blue, linen thread.",

            "public_access_description": "Half a child's skull cap in silk and linen. Egyptian,  ca. AD 1000-1400. From a tomb. The cover fabric is pattern woven in silk and undyed linen and thin strips of leather with some remaining gilt. Very fine, buff, silk warp with wefts of red, light blue, dark blue, light green, dark green silks and undyed linen (z-spun). The fabric has continuous colourful stripes across it. The brown leather strips are 2mm wide and some sign of gilding remains. The leather sits along the middle of a stripe of dark blue silk. The linen lining is plain weave; undyed; approx. 23 x 23 tpc. Some bad staining is present with some holes. There is a separate small square of plain, roughly woven, stained linen attached to the side of the cap.\n\nThe construction is much like 1099-1900 but only half the cap remains. The cover has been  hemmed onto a thin band/strip of undyed linen (approx. 7mm wide). On the outer side, a running stitch, in undyed, linen thread, can be seen to run through the middle of this band, all the way around.  On the inner side the band has been sewn onto the lining with a whip stitch using blue, linen thread. The undyed linen thread of the outer, running stitch can be seen. Two parallel lines of  running stitch go around the edge of the cap (in blue, linen thread). Along  the centre of the lining are four, parallel  lines of stitching in blue linen thread in a running  stitch. Two one  either side of the centre, 3mm  between each line. These lines end approx. 20mm  before the edge of  the cap. It is possible that  these threads could be  pulled to tighten the cap for  a closer fit? A small portion of what would have been a linen tie remains on one side. It is sewn to the cap with blue, linen thread.",
