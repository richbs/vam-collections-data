When acquired the motif was sewn to a modern plain white chasuble from which it has now been removed.\n\nThe Society of St Margaret in East Grinstead was founded in 1854 and the sisters of the order were famed for their embroidery worked from the designs of the leading church architects and designers of the day. An embroidery school, known as St Katherine's Convent, was set up in 1870 in Queen's Square, Bloomsbury. Here the sisters made and sold vestments, altar frontals and banners exhibiting at various exhibitions organised in conjunction with the Churches Congresses. The Queen Square community went over to Rome in 1908 but the convent in East Grinstead remained Anglican, continuing with its own embroidery.",
