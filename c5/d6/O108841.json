He also designed vestments, banners and windows for churches all over the world. It has been claimed that he was the greatest church furnisher since Wren, and Sir John Betjeman said of him that: \u2018his ecclesiastical tastes are rococo; he is perfectly satisfied so long as gold leaf is heaped on everywhere\u2019. Despite this critique, he did work firmly within the Arts & Crafts principle that functionality was paramount. Comper died on 22 December 1960. His ashes were buried beneath the windows he designed in Westminster Abbey, where he had been responsible also for the Warriors\u2019 chapel.\n\nThe silk for this cope was designed by Sir Ninian Comper and woven by Perkins and Sons Ltd. The red silk was called \u2018Cathedral Damask\u2019, the green silk \u2018Kensington\u2019.",
