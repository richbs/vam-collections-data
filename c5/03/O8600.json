As the name suggests, the church of Saint-Pierre-du-Chatel was dedicated to St Peter. This panel is one of three that depict important episodes relating to Peter and the early years of the Christian church. \n\nDuring his lifetime, Christ named Peter as the leader of the Apostles and thus the foundation stone (Latin petra) of the church. \nPeter travelled to Rome on at least two occasions to spread the word of Christ. We know that he was executed there, probably during the period of persecution under the emperor Nero (AD 64\u20138). The earliest known account describing his death dates from the end of the 2nd century. Here Peter is shown being crucified upside down on a cross. Crucifixion was a common form of execution for non-Roman citizens, and tradition states that Peter refused to be crucified in the same manner as Christ.",

ISBN 1851774041\nBernard Rackham, A Guide to the Collecitons of Stained Glass, V&A Museum, 1936\n(p.70) The introduction into French art about 1520 of the early Renaissance style from Italy had at first little effect on glass-painting. Its influence is seen in the adoption of classical instead of Gothic motives in ornamental accessories of costume, architectural canopies, or borders, but the technique and the general colour values of stained glass continued for some time on purely medieval lines. This is well seen in a series of three lights, of about 1525, from a church in Normandy, with scenes from the life and martyrdom of St  Peter. In their rich colouring they approximate to many windows of the period to be seen in the parish churches of Rouen; only in the small classical details of architectural accessories and ornamental borders do they show the change to the fashions of the Renaissance.",
