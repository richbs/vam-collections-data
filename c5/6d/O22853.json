The workshops had been started by Gimson and Sidney and Ernest Barnsleyto produce furniture in the tradition of the Arts and Crafts Movement. This cabinet was inspired by British furniture of the 17th century and demonstrates the continuing strength of the Arts and Crafts tradition in Britain even after World War I. After Gimson\u2019s death in 1919, van der Waals started his own workshop in Chalford, Gloucestershire, producing domestic furniture.\n\nThe honest construction of the cabinet, which uses solid wood and has revealed joints, connects Waals to the traditions of  the 19th century designers William Morris and A W. N. Pugin. Frank Pick, who commissioned the cabinet, was a life-long admirer of Morris and deeply committed to real links between art and industry. As Commercial Manager, and later Chief Executive of London Transport he was a major patron of modern artists and designers.",
