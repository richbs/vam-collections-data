            "physical_description": "A wooden picture-tray puzzle of an ocean scene painted in light blue, pale grey, white, mustard yellow, green, red and black. The pieces consist of a lighthouse, seagull, ocean liner, two fish and two waves, and also a rowing boat in which two sailors are seated, wearing white trousers, red jerseys and black hats and shoes, and both with yellow beards. They are rowing with two oars each, again painted mustard yellow and painted onto the base. Nine of the eleven pieces have a small, wooden knob attached by a metal pin, which is painted either yellow, green or red. The puzzle is made from layers of plywood. The upper layer has been painted and machine cut to form the loose puzzle pieces and surround, the latter having been pinned onto the unpainted base. The whole is framed by a varnished oak framing, again pinned in place.\n[puzzle piece] Plywood puzzle piece cut into the shape of a sailor (mariner), with a small red cube-shaped knob attached by a metal pin. The figure, which has outstretched arms to row and looking to the left, is wearing a red jersey, white trousers and black hat and shoes, with a yellow beard and red cheek. Facial details are picked out in black, as is an outline in parts. The right arm has been broken off just below the shoulder.\n[puzzle piece] Plywood puzzle piece, cut into the shape of a fish leaping out of the water to the left, with a small green cube-shaped knob attached by a metal pin. The body of the fish is painted light grey with white and green scales, the mouth, fins and tail are painted red, and there is black outlining and details in places.\n[puzzle piece] Plywood puzzle piece cut into the shape of a wave, with a small grey cube-shaped knob attached by a metal pin. The wave is painted light blue with a grey shadow running down both side, a black shadow on its left side and a white highlight on its right side.\n[puzzle piece] Plywood puzzle piece cut into an irregular shape, with a red mark and hole where a small red cube-shaped knob, which was attached by a metal pin, has been lost. The piece, painted in green and grey with black detailing, fits into the space between the two rowing sailors, and completes the gunwales of the rowing boat. The bottom-most layer of laminate is becoming detached on one corner.\n[puzzle piece] Plywood puzzle piece cut into the shape of a sailor (mariner), with a small red cube-shaped knob attached by a metal pin. The figure, which has outstretched arms to row and looking to the left, is wearing a red jersey, white trousers and black hat and shoes, with a yellow beard and red cheek. Facial details are picked out in black, as is an outline in parts.\n[puzzle piece] Plywood puzzle piece cut into the shape of a rowing boat (although the positioning of other jigsaw pieces within it have resulted in it forming an irregular shape), with a small yellow cube-shaped knob attached by a metal pin. The hull and seats of the boat are painted mustard yellow, with a light grey interior and green and white gunwales and tiller.\n[puzzle piece] Plywood puzzle piece cut into the shape of a wave, with a small grey cube-shaped knob attached by a metal pin. The wave is painted light blue with a grey and black shadow running down its left side.\n[puzzle piece] Plywood puzzle piece, cut into the shape of a fish leaping out of the water to the right, with a small green cube-shaped knob attached by a metal pin. The body of the fish is painted light grey with white and green scales, the mouth, fins and tail are painted red, and there is black outlining and details in places.\n[puzzle piece] Plywood puzzle piece cut into the shape of a large ship or ocean-going liner with smoke coming from its three funnels, with a small yellow cube-shaped knob attached by a metal pin. The hull of the boat is painted mustard yellow, the cabins white, two funnels red with a black stripe and the third black, and the smoke is painted white. There is green to suggest shadow, and black detailing and outline in places. Waves at the bow are depicted in black, green and white.\n[puzzle piece] Plywood puzzle piece cut into the shape of a flying seagull with a small grey cube-shaped knob attached by a metal pin. The seagull is painted white with a light blue back, with a black outline and detailing.\n[puzzle piece] Plywood puzzle piece cut into the shape of a lighthouse. The base and balcony is painted mustard yellow, the main body of the lighthouse white and the top red, with green and black painted down the left side of the lighthouse, suggesting shadow. A bent metal pin is embedded in the front, the small, cube-shaped knob it used to attach is missing.\n[puzzle] Tray puzzle base, wood. Painted onto the base is a pale blue sea with stylised wave details picked out in black, white and green. Also painted onto the base is a light grey sky with white clouds and a white and green fish, with red fin and mouth. Drawn onto the base in black and orange ink, presumably by the owner after production, are six fish, one crab and one jellyfish. These appear on the unpainted wood on the base underneath the jigsaw pieces.",

It is assumed that it was signed, at the request of the donor, by Freda Skinner later, as she was a colleague of the donor at Wimbledon School of Art.\n\nHistorical significance: This puzzle is a good and particularly early example of the type of well-designed wooden toys manufactured and sold by the Paul and Marjorie Abbatt Ltd.
