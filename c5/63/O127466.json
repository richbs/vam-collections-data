De Bry was a Frankfurt goldsmith, engraver, print-seller and bookseller who chronicled many of the earliest European expeditions to the Americas. Beginning in 1590, de Bry and his sons brought out a series of translations of accounts of the New World from Spanish, French, English, Italian and Dutch sources. Each volume was accompanied by detailed graphic illustrations of indigenous customs, culture, warfare and historical events. Many were based on first hand observations making them a rare visual record of early contact between Europeans and the inhabitants of the New World. After de Bry\u2019s death the series was extended to include voyages to Africa and Asia.\n\nThe de Bry series offered an eager European public an early glimpse of distant lands and \u2018exotic\u2019 people. The illustrations, which were hugely popular, were widely copied during the 17th and 18th centuries.",
