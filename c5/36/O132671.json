He collected items not particularly because he was researching for a particular production, but simply because they took his fancy.  He amassed a collection of hats and headdresses, including this flat 'pancake' hat, one of the plainer items to catch his eye.  Given that it is exceptionally plain, and that the bright blue silk lining must have given the wearer a strange pallor, he may have been more attracted by the construction, with its subtle shaping up to the crown, or its materials, a mix of straw base laid in concentric circles, overlaid with vertical stitching.  \n\nOliver Messel (1904-1978) was Britain's leading theatre designer from the early 1930s to the mid 1950s, working in every aspect of entertainment - ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue - as well as in interior decoration and textile design.  His lavish, painterly and romantic designs informed by period styles, were perfectly in tune with his times and earned him an international reputation.  By 1960, however, Messel's style had become unfashionable, having no sympathy with the new 'kitchen sink' school of theatre.  He increasingly concentrated on his non-theatrical painting and designing and eventually retired to the Caribbean, where he began a new career designing and building highly idiosyncratic luxury villas.",
