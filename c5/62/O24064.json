            "physical_description": "[Vase] Vase of stoneware with pale green natural ash glaze. Cylindrical ribbed form reaching a maximum diameter at the first rib and tapering towards the mouth. Heavily thrown from rough Shigaraki clay; bold horizontal carving to produce four ribbed sections on exterior; flat trimmed base showing remains of string-cutting in slightly  concave centre. Natural ash glaze settling on mouthrim and front five-eights of exterior; slight gloss to back part of exterior and internal areas immediately below mouthrim; many protrusions of partially fused white particles erupting from the clay body.\n\nThe pale green colour of the ash glaze and the greyish colour of the clay body was the result of instant cooling of the vase as it was taken out of the wood-firing kiln at the height of reduction firing with a long stainless steel rod. The vase would have been placed near the mouth or one of the ports of the kiln. The three black marks on the ribs were caused by the vase being dropped accidentally on the ground as it was being removed. This technique has its origins in methods used in late 16th century Mino to produce Black Seto teabowls. Its use on large forms made from Shigaraki clay, however, is unique to Yoshida. Yoshida's use of ribbing, which is seen on much of his work, especially his <i>kohiki</i>-glazed pieces, is inspired by primitive wooden utensils from Africa and elsewhere.\n[Storage box] Wooden box (comprising box and lid), signed on inside of lid by the artist: 'Shigaraki tsuchi Shinogizutsu / Yoshida Yoshihiko' and seal.",

Understated and contemplative, his post have a quite grandeur that has brought him considerable recognition in recent years. Yoshida does not belong to the Japan Crafts Association or any other such organization. Furthermore, unlike most artists working in traditional styles, who tend to focus on a single idiom, he is something of a polymath. As the foremost student of the Arakawa Toyozo (1894-1985), under whom he worked from 1956 to 1968, he is a master of Shino and Black Seto wares. He is also well known for his so-called kohiki wares, stonewares covered in white slip and clear glaze in a style reminiscent of Chos\u00f4n period (1392-1910) Korean ceramics of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. His experiments with Shigaraki clay are a fairly recent development, as is his exploration of burnished earthenware.",
