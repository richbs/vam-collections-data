Ring brooches can be circular or heart-shaped, and their design dates from the Middle Ages.  They differ from modern brooches in the way they fasten.  The wearer pulls the cloth of the garment through the central hole, and then spears it with the pin.  The greater the strain on the pin, the more secure the fastening.\n\nHeart brooches are one of the commonest surviving types of Scottish traditional brooch. They are sometimes called luckenbooth brooches, after the stalls round St. Giles Cathedral in Edinburgh, where they were sold in the 19th century.  They are also known as witches' brooches.  Small heart brooches were often fastened in children's clothing for 'averting the evil eye and keeping away witches'.  Mothers also wore them to prevent the witches from stealing their milk.  They were frequently given as love tokens.  Women wore them at the neck of their shift to keep the front opening closed.  \n\nMost traditional Scottish heart brooches were made of silver, as the rural people who wore them could rarely afford gold.  This brooch may have belonged to a townswoman. It is made of heavy gold, and the design of a heart pierced by two arrows is more sophisticated than is usual.",
