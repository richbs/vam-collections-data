It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years. Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nPeter Ustinov, actor, writer, director, author, linguist and wit, was born in England to parents of Russian extraction. He made his first London stage appearance at the Players' Theatre Club in one of his own sketches, and appeared in several films in the 1940s that he also wrote and directed.",
