The cousins were not inventors but innovators who, by applying the techniques to industry, revolutionized the silver and plating trades all over the world. In the 1840s, licences to make the new products were sold widely in Britain and abroad to firms such as Christofle & Co. in Paris. Electroplate, a cheaper and more durable substitute for silver, replaced Sheffield plate within ten years and challenged the supremacy of silver on the dining tables and in the drawing rooms of Europe.\n\nThe power of the machinery and new technology now at the disposal of the silver industry could produce thousands of identical items to a standard formula of design, quality and price. The focus of silver and silver product manufacture moved from London to the new factories of Birmingham and Sheffield.",
