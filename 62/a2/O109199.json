The rim is decorated with various characters from his plays, including Shylock and Portia from The Merchant of Venice, Rosalind and Touchstone from As You Like It, Malvolio from Twelfth Night, Katharine from The Taming of the Shrew, Falstaff from Henry IV and The Merry Wives of Windsor and the eponymous characters King Lear, Othello, Macbeth, Henry V, and Richard III.\n\nThe plate was produced by Royal Doulton who introduced the pattern in 1909 and withdrew it in 1938. Royal Doulton began in Lambeth, London, in 1815 when John Doulton manufactured ceramic items such as stoneware bottles and sewer pipes. The Victorian revolution in hygiene and sanitation ensured its success, and Doulton later produced tableware and commemorative items such as this.  They moved to Burslem in The Potteries in 1882, added porcelain to their production two years later and were granted a Royal Warrant in 1901.",
