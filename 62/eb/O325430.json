All the parts of this piece are typical of Swiss filigree jewellery, but they are unlikely ever to have been worn together like this in Switzerland.  They were probably put together as a souvenir for British tourists, who loved traditional jewellery of all kinds, in the late 19th century.\n\nThe two chains, with decorative hooks at the ends, and the pendant rosette were probably originally part of a G\u00f6llerkette.  G\u00f6llerketten, meaning collar chains, are unique to Switzerland and parts of southern Germany.  Originally Swiss women used laces to hold their white linen collars in place, but by the 19th century they had switched to silver chains.  They wore them in pairs, one on each side of the body.  These chains linked the lower outside corners of the collar, at the front and back, by passing under the arm.  At each end there was a decorative filigree hook, which was attached to the corners of the collar.  The piece was usually finished with a large decorative filigree rosette, which hung down as a pendant from the front hook, with a small pendant heart, matching those at the ends of the chain, hanging from its lower edge. \n\nThe rosette of this piece has had four extra pendants, shaped like blue-bells, added along its lower edge, instead of its original single heart.  These may have come from Wurttemberg, in south-west Germany.  The tulip-shaped plaque at the top of the rosette is also probably added.  The large heart-shaped filigree plaque in the centre of the chain must have originally been a belt hook, holding apron chains and pendants.",
