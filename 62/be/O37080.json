To the left is a door and more shelving which appears to form a window.  It is possible that the squared shelving is actually a window display.  In front of the counter stand a woman and a boy and girl; behind the counter stands another woman.  Each square of the shelving shows all or part of an object.  The most recognisable are doll figures and horses.  The top area is patterned as a plaster ceiling and the bottom a wooden floor.  Below the image is KIRK.\nThe reverse side is marked with details of the shop:\n\n                                     DUTCH\n                                AND ENGLISH\n                              TOYS, FANS, &c.\n                              SOLD BY I KIRK\n                                 IN St PAUL'S\n                                   CHURCH\n                                      YARD.\n\n\n*NOTES\nIn common with the practice at the time, James Kirk used the initial I rather than J on the token.  He was a seller and not a maker of toys, however, he was also listed as an engraver and a seal engraver.  The best guide to the London merchants at this date is the Kent Directory and James Kirk is not listed in any volumes between 1780 and 1800.  The merchant had to pay to be included and this may be the reason he does not appear.  (The other person who does not appear is John Wallis although he does appear in others directories because he was a member of the Stationer's Livery).  Kirk is not listed as being a member of any of the city Liveries.\n1.  (first record available) Bailey's British Directory of Merchants & Traders's Useful Companion, 1784, 1st Edition\n         JAMES KIRK TOY WAREHOUSE No. 52 St. PAUL'S CHURCH YARD\n2.

Also there may be listings in Land Tax books and Rates books.  At the time of these records, no listing against addresses were made except in the Land Tax and Rates and usually only for the owner and not for tenants.  Both the will and the tax records will need to be researched.\n\n*Notes.\nJames Kirk is listed in the 1922 book Tickets & passes of Great Britain & Ireland by W J Davis & A W Waters, Leamington Spa.  He is recorded as having stuck other tokens one of which showed the shop with a woman \n\non the left holding a dancing doll and a soldier with a drum on the right.\nThe book states Kirk sold `all Royal Counters Geo.III'",
