            "physical_description": "Painting, in opaque watercolour and gold on paper, two lovers sit with their legs entwined on a rug placed on a terrace, while two female musicians kneel beside them to the left.   A female attendant stands behind the couple holding a bottle.  The principal lady has a gold fringed grey nimbus round her head indicating she is a princess of the imperial family.  Her pearl necklace interspersed with emeralds and large red stones, which are probably spinnels, further attest to her royal lineage as a necklace of this appearance can be seen in paintings of the Emperors Jahangir and Shah Jahan.  She is bare-breasted and her gauzy <i>peshwaz</i> with its rows of chevron lappets down either side of the bodice is open wide, allowing her lover to be able to cup her right breast in his hand.  She, in turn, is holding up a small jewelled glass to him as he embraces her with his other arm.  The princess is wearing golden <i>paijama</i> decorated with a half-drop pattern of leaves and a <i>patka</i> decorated with a scroll of red flowers tucked into her waistband.  The skirt of the transparent <i>peshwaz</i> is paned in gold.  She wears a transparent, gold-edged <i>dupatta</i> over her head and shoulders with floral decorated ends.\n      Her lover has a red and gold striped turban ornamented with pearls. He is wearing a gauzy <i>kurta</i> over orange striped <i>paijama</i>.  The musicians, who are playing a <i>tambur</i> and a tambourine, are dressed in a similar fashion to the princess, whereas the attendant on the right is distinguished by her hat with a broad up-standing brim and black aigrette. The lovers rest against a green cushion piled on top of a purple bolster.  The rug on which they sit has a cream-coloured ground sprigged with rose blooms.  On its edge is a cushion supporting a dish of melons and peach-like fruits, a small lidded basket for pan and another leaf-like bowl filled with purple fruits.\n      A  pierced balustrade encloses the terrace in the foreground and divides the terrace behind the figures from the grey lake beyond.  Rounded, rocky hills rise up in the background with rows of rounded trees growing upon them.  A group of white buildings nestles behind one of these clumps of trees.  The sky above is a muted grey with a full moon encircled by a white aureole  with outlines of vestigial clouds in white.\n   The painting has an inner border of orange paint outlined in white with black lines ruled round the painted image and either side of an outer gold line.  A further blue line has been drawn on the main border which has an ivory ground and is decorated with a row of alternate pink lilies and red poppies outlined in gold.\n   The margins of the page are edged in strips of buff-coloured paper with a white outline.  There is also an inner line of gold outlined in black on either side.  The gutter is a darker, faded pink colour which has been added at a later date when the album was re-bound.",

It contains 56 leaves on which are Mughal miniature paintings, drawing and flower studies on both sides. The binding is covered with an Indian brocade silk that may have been cut from lengths brought home by the 2nd Lord Clive, who served as Governor of Madras, 1799 to 1803.  The album was sold from Powis Castle at Sotheby's sale, 16 to 18 January 1956, lot 332A.",
