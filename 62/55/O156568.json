            "public_access_description": "The military trophies depicted on this box were probably designed by Giovan Battista Giorgi, who was appointed painter-designer to the Opificio in 1815. A document of 1822 in the archives of the Grand Ducal Workshop describes a snuffbox similar to this one and discusses the costs associated with its making.  The box was probably also made in Florence.\n\nHardstone mosaic techniques emerged in Florence, where Ferdinand de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, founded the Grand Ducal Workshop (Opificio delle Pietre Dure) in 1588. It still operates today under the Italian Ministry for Cultural Heritage. \n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
