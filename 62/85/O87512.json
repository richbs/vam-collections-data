In the 1700s the villa belonged to the famous actor David Garrick and his wife. From about 1768 they commissioned furnishings from the well-known firm of Thomas Chippendale of St Martin\u2019s Lane in London. Chippendale provided light, pretty, painted furniture, suited to a house that was designed for leisure and entertaining. An inventory made in 1779 recorded \u2018six rush bottom Bamboo Chairs\u2019 in the drawing room. Although these chairs match that description, they were probably made slightly later. In 1786 and again in 1794 the widowed Mrs Garrick bought more chairs like this from at least two different suppliers",
