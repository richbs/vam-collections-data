In China some mushrooms have long been considered to have magical properties and to be a good omen. The myth of the magic fungus, although little understood in Britain in the 19th century, would have appealed to an audience interested in the 'exotic' East. Commonly known as 'Chinese blue-and- white', vases like this were used to decorate the interiors of many British homes in the 19th century.\n \nChinese blue and white porcelain had been imported into Britain since the 16th century. Although by the 1870s it was no longer regarded as rare, it continued to feature prominently in interior design. Rooms were filled with blue and white porcelain of different shapes and sizes to create a sumptuous effect. Older pieces were displayed alongside newer products.",
