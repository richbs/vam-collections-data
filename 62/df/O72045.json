He described linocut as 'very much a designers' medium', which made uncompromising demands on the printmaker: a slip was irretrievable, and a wrongly cut line could not be put right. Here, Bawden makes good use of an ornamental pattern found in the buildings and finds decorative possibilities in the pollarded and leafless trees. The limited palette makes unusual and effective use of colour, particularly in the improbable mustard sky.",
