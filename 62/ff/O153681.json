In the 1930s it became fashionable to wear 'house pyjamas' - trousers with large bottoms made in a soft material. This design by Victor Stiebel shows how this concept could be transformed for more formal occasions from house cocktails to cruise parties. Similar designs were also created by the Surrealist designer Schiaparelli. Stiebel's halter neck, sleeveless top contrasts the large bottom trousers wonderfully. This design ca. 1934-35 includes bright orange gloves, a brim hat and matching shoes.",
