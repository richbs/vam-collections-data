Yellow ground with a narrow outer border with a green meander with trefoil shaped red flowers and small green leaves. This border is repeated on 3 sides around the central panel and in between is a wider border on which are isolated upward pointing floral sprigs with a red carnation, a bud and green leaves. This is on 3 sides around the central panel which is rectangular but contains a lobed arch which is quilted into a diamond grid.  There are isolated red floral sprigs which appear to have been embroidered first and then yellow silk was used for the quilting. Towards the top of the arch is a roundel containing an inscription in red and green silk.  The spandrels are filled with a green grid, each compartment containing a red bud and green leaves.\nEmbroidery Thread: red green, yellow silk; 2S\nBacking: pieced across the middle. White ground with a dense pattern of parallel wavy brown stems with pink blossoms and brown and blue flowers; some yellow and green.\nFacing: bias-cut, striped silk: a blue stripe alternating with a small chevron pattern in red, yellow and white. It forms a narrow edging on the front of the mat.",
