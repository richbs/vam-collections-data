The embroidery is worked through all three layers. The sides have been neatly sewn together - there are no raw edges.  Were they sold like this so that the purchaser could add their own choice of decorative backing?\nCream ground with a border of inward facing isolated red and green floral sprigs bending to the left; the ground of the border has been quilted with cream silk in a scale-like pattern.  There is an inner and outer border with a green meander with a small red carnation.\nThe main section has a lobed roundel in the centre formed by a green band with red spots. There is a flower in the centre enclosed within an 8-pointed star which links 4 large red full flowers and 4 flowers in profile only.  A pair of serrated leaves and a small trefoil flower emerge from the top of each of these flowers. There are 12 small trees around the outer edge of the roundel.\nA quarter of the roundel, minus the trees, is in each corner. \nThe rest of the ground is decorated with off-set rows of floral sprigs which have green leaves and 3 red carnations. They are upright in the lower half, and downward pointing in the upper half.\nThe ground is quilted in a scale pattern.\nThreads: red, green and cream.\n\nSome of the running stitches have worn away leaving needle holes in the ground fabric.  There is no underdrawing indicating the lines for quilting, although underdrawing can been seen under the floral motifs.",
