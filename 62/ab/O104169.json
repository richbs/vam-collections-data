Individual apostle spoons were sometimes given as Christening gifts but intended for use. Groups depicting all 12 apostles were more likely to be owned by wealthier members of society (noblemen were more likely to have several dozen spoons in various shapes;  a tradesman would have about six to 12).  Few complete sets have survived. During the Reformation many religious images were destroyed, and silver was melted down and re-used.\n\nSt John the Evangelist, the figure on the finial of this spoon, was one of four who described the life of Jesus in the gospels (with Matthew, Mark and Luke). By the 13th century, it was common to depict St John holding a chalice with a serpent or dragon rising from it. Many believe this refers to an incident where John was handed a cup of poisoned wine, which he blessed, and the poison rose out of the cup in the shape of a serpent. On this spoon, St John\u2019s hand is raised in a blessing and he holds a cup out of which a creature emerges.",
