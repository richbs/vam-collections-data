            "physical_description": "Boot of woven silk and metal thread with a leather sole, an embroidered leather heel panel and woven silk and metal thread braid, lined with resist and block printed cotton.\nThis is an ankle length boot and the leg part is formed from a rectangular panel of silk seamed down the back.  A shaped piece covers the top of the foot and is joined around the ankle with 2 small shaped inserts added on the right and 3 added on the left to create the correct fit. The stitched sole is brown leather.  Added to this up the back of the heel is an arch-shape of white leather on which a design seems to have been drawn in green ink.  Gold wire has been used to embroider a pattern of interlinked crosses within an arch shape.  Pink and dark grey silk form X-shapes in the spaces.  This silk is also used to make stylized buds forming a border on 2 sides with couched gold wire edging it.\nThe main fabric has a gold ground [silver strip open S-wound on a yellow silk core]. There is a small scale ogival lattice formed by a band with a green meander and red and green motifs. Each segment contains a floral spray with a central red and 2 blue flowers with fine details in faded mauve.\nSee also: T.187-1921\nThere is woven braid around the top of the boot.  This is woven with a silver-gilt strip. There is a central line of pink flowers on a green stem with green leaves, alternating in direction; to either side is a narrow border with a meander of green and gold leaves and red and gold flowers on a darker ground.\nLining: this does not extend over the sole. Plain weave cotton with a red ground with large and very small indistinct floral motifs in white with faded purple details.",
