It was probably made by Donatello, but we do not know when or for whom.  It may have been a trial piece for a commission to decorate the doors of Siena cathedral, on which Donatello was working in 1457-9, and may be the bronze relief of approximately this size mentioned in the cathedral records in 1639.  The gaps between the figures, which were chiselled away after casting, were probably deliberate and may have been intended to allow a background of coloured cloth or stone to show through. The relief was left largely unfinished after casting but this rough appearance seems appropriate to the raw emotion evident in it.",

            "history_note": "The original purpose of this relief is not known, and various theories have been advanced about its place and date of manufacture.  It is widely accepted to be by Donatello.\n\nIt was perhaps a test piece for the doors of Siena Cathedral, an unfinished project on which Donatello was working in 1457-9.  The Cathedral inventory of 1639 lists a bronze demonstration panel of approximately this size.  Pope-Hennessy rejects this theory on stylistic grounds, suggesting that it is more likely to have been made immediately before Donatello's time in Padua (1443-53). He proposes that its drapery, types and relief style are similar to that on the bronze doors of the Old Sacristy of San Lorenzo, Florence, completed before 1443.  Antony Radcliffe remarked on the similarity of the drapery forms to those shown on the Chellini roundel (A.1-1976), which he suggested might support a later date for the present relief after Donatello's return from Padua.\n\nThe background has been cut away after casting in places.  Pope-Hennessy asserted that \"the removal of the background was presumably occasioned by casting flaws\", but many of the gaps correspond to the outlines of the figures in too deliberate a way to make this likely to be the sole reason for cutting away.  Nicholas Penny has suggested that the gaps may have been intended to allow a background of coloured cloth or stone to show through.",
