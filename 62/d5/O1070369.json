Full Citation:\n\n\u201c<b>79 Called Charles, 5th Lord North</b>\n (b. 1635 d.1690/1 ) \n<b>1655-60</b> \nEvans 19 \n\n<b>Oval59x49mm</b> \n\nFeatures in free hatches of brown with small touches of sanguine, blue in the shadows, and white heightening, on a thick pale carnation ground; hair in brown washes with some white; armour in grey and blue wash with white heightening and yellow gouache for the studs; background to the left a dense brown wash, to the right a sky and landscape in blue, grey, green and white, with some bare vellum; on vellum put down on a leaf from a table-book. \n\n<b>Condition:</b> Extensive losses especially in the face, with retouches; flaking, abrasions and losses, especially to the left. \n\n<b>Signed:</b> Not signed. \n\n<b>Frame:</b> Nineteenth-century oval copper-gilt locket, the convex back overlapping the straight sides which hold the shallowly convex glass by its bevelled edge in a bezel; inside the glass, a gilt-foil strip covers the sides of the miniature where, in seventeenth-century practice, the edges of the vellum would be painted with a metallic gold border; the hanger of D-section chased and grooved down the middle, and soldered to the backplate of the locket; at the base of the hanger, two small separate loops of flat wire rise into a pair of diminishing spirals of five turns. On the back of the locket, several labels, including a printed exhibition label <i>On loan from/1862 and inscribed in ink: Baroness North/Aug.22.</i> Another label inscribed in ink: <i>Charles/ Lord North.</i> The back of the locket also scratched <i>7255</i> and a dealer's price code <i>SM/ -/-</i>. \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> Believed to be by descent in the family of the Lords North de Kirtling at Wroxton Abbey, near Banbury, axon; acquired by the Hon. FHA Wallop in 1922 and lent to theV&A 1927-49; given to Alan Evans in 1933, by whom bequeathed to the National Gallery, 1974; placed on indeterminate loan at the V&A. (See Appendix 3.) \n\n<b>Exhibited:</b> According to a label on the back of the locket, lent to the South Kensington Museum in 1862, but not in the catalogue of the Special Exhibition of that year; nor, as <i>5th Lord North</i>, at South Kensington 1865. \n\n<b>Literature:</b> Williamson, 'Miniature Painting', <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>, 1946 edn, repro. voL L-M, pl. I; Reynolds 1952, p.62; <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 10. \n\nWallop evidently attributed this miniature to Cooper, but Long annotated the entry in the Wallop Loan Book 'obviously an old copy, not very good'. Reynolds in 1949 added the note 'I think this is by T Flatman', and this attribution was adopted for the Christie's catalogue and valuation of 1969. \n\nRecent examination does not support the attribution to Flatman. Though there is much overpainting, enough of the original face remains for it to be arguable that the miniature is basically an unfinished Cooper, 'finished' by a later hand, and later still damaged and 'restored' . The areas of bare vellum and the unhatched state of the hair and background support this interpretation, and, together with the surviving areas of the face painting, seem technically consistent with the miniatures in <i>The Pocket Book</i> attributed to Cooper (Cat. Nos 88-95 [446-1892; 448-1892; 449-1892; 454-1893; Evans 41; Dyce 93; P.22-1941; 304-1890) and even <i>A Lady Carew</i> (Cat. No. 78 [Dyce 92]). \n\nIconographically, this miniature relates closely to the John Carew of the late 1650s or early 1660s in the Carew Pole Collection. (1) The latter, however, shows emphatically how the overpainting on this miniature has coarsened and obscured a basically strong image. \n\nCharles, Lord North de Kirtling and Lord Grey of Rolleston, the 5th Baron, was born on 1 October 1635 and died in January 1690/1. (For another portrait see Ashfield, Cat. No. 131.) He himself, though the son and father of distinguished soldiers, does not seem to have carried arms. The identification seems likely to rest on his being, within the family, roughly the right age for the likeness, but there were nine other children of the 4th Baron who survived infancy, so guessing sitters in this generation is especially hazardous. \n\n1 NPG 1974. no. 73.\u201d",
