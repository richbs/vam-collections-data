There is a small portrait of Ira Aldridge as Shylock, kneeling and holding his knife, in a pendant roundel beneath the bust of Shakespeare, with the words: 'I would have my bond'. To the right and left are small full-length portraits of Aldridge standing, as Othello, right, and Macbeth, left.  Below Othello are inscribed the words in green paint (partly illegible) from Act 5 scene 2 of <i>Othello</i>: 'I have no wife. O, insupportable! O heavy hour.' Below the portrait of Aldridge as Macbeth are inscribed the words from Act 3 Scene 2 of <i>Macbeth</i>: 'Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow!'. The date 1858 is painted above the inscription in Russian, above which are portraits of three Classical Muses, one with a lyre, one with a mask on her head and holding a dagger, and one blowing a trumpet.  Inscribed by the artist lower right: 'J.CHARLEMAGNE'",

            "public_access_description": "The African American actor Ira Aldridge (1807-1867) was born in New York where he was involved as a student with the African Theatre. He made his first London appearance in the East End, in May 1825 at the Royalty Theatre Whitechapel, as Othello. In October 1825 he played the enslaved West African Prince Oroonoko at the Coburg Theatre, billed as 'Mr. Keene'.  By April 1833 he starred at Covent Garden as Othello, and a month later was at the Pavilion, billed as 'the African Roscius', playing Othello in mid-May, and two weeks later the vengeful Moorish Prince Zanga in Alonzo of Castile, a version of Young's play The Revenge. Aldridge's versatile repertoire encompassed comic and tragic parts, and white roles including Shylock and Macbeth. A good singer, he even accompanied himself on the guitar performing ballads and minstrel songs, some made famous by his contemporary T.D. Rice (1808-1860).\n\nIra Aldridge found fame in Europe as well as Great Britain, as is evident from this Russian tribute to him. He made several continental tours and died on a tour in L\u00f3dz, Poland, where he is buried in the Evangelical cemetery.",
