His Tokudo, ceremony that marks a practitioner\u2019s ordination as a Zen priest, took place on April, 8th, 1976. After his time in Japan, he travelled to India and Thailand and subsequently returned to the UK in 1980. In September 2001, Zenko Croysdale donated to the Museum his set of Zen monk\u2019s robes and accessories. \n\nSuch a set of monk\u2019s clothing and utilitarian objects are rare items in Museum\u2019s collection and offer a valuable insight into the daily life of Zen monk.
