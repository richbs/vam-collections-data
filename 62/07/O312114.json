By reference to medallic images, this portrait appears to show him aged between about 15 and 20. The horse and rider are related in from and style to the equestrian statue of King Charles I by Le Sueur (1633), now in Trafalgar Square, and to a small bronze statuette of Louis XIII on horseback in the Museum (A.1-1994), inscribed LE SVEVER on the girth. This type of walking horse is derived from Giambologna's monument to Cosimo I (Piazza della Signoria, Florence) which was reflected in Pietro Tacca's equestrian monument to Henri IV of France, formerly on the Pont Neuf, Paris, but destroyed during the French Revolution.\n\nLe Sueur was an established sculptor, recognised for his exceptional bronze-casting skills by the King, before being sent to London where he stayed until the Civil War forced his return to France.  His skill and precision in portraying armour may reflect the influence of his father who was a master armourer in Paris.",

By reference to medallic images, this portrait appears to show him aged between about 15 and 20. The horse and rider are related in from and style to the equestrian statue of King Charles I by Le Sueur (1633), now in Trafalgar Square, and to a small bronze statuette of Louis XIII on horseback in the Museum (A.1-1994), inscribed LE SVEVER on the girth. This type of walking horse is derived from Giambologna's monument to Cosimo I (Piazza della Signoria, Florence) which was reflected in Pietro Tacca's equestrian monument to Henri IV of France, formerly on the Pont Neuf, Paris, but destroyed during the French Revolution.",
