It comprises a ping-pong ball printed with the details of the show, in a box with a folded printed sheet with a diagram on one side entitled 'Fig. 1 - the pathophysiology of death. The fate of the body after death ' and on the back details of Certified Poison Control Centers in the USA.\n\nHirst is one of the most important artists of his generation. The exhibition demonstrated his continued obsession with absence, longing, memory and loss, explored through exhibits such as cabinets of curiosities, medical paraphernalia, and references to the frailty of the body.\n\nThe form of the invitation linked directly to the show: the title piece consisted of two vitrines filled with bouncing ping-pong balls. Another piece had a human skeleton, laid out on a glass cross, with rapidly rotating ping-pong balls held up on jets of air, serving as eyes.",
