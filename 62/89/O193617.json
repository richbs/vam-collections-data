            "public_access_description": "This poster was commissioned by the World Lithuanian Community and printed in Canada. The entire edition, comprising several huge packages, was brought to Lithuania to the headquarters of the Sajudis reform movement prior to the elections for the Supreme Soviet of the LSSR (held on 24 February 1990). This was the first election to the legislature in which opposition parties could participate. However the Soviet government of Lithuania remained strong and censorship laws were still officially in force during the election campaign. Lithuanians abroad thought that Sajudis might be unable to print posters opposing the Communist Party and decided to help.  \n\nThe poster exposes Soviet officials, known as the nomenclature, in a very original and witty way. Representatives of the nomenclature participated actively in the elections as Lithuanian Communist Party candidates. They promoted the idea of a slow progress towards Lithuanian sovereignty and opposed the more decisive policies of Sajudis. \n\nThe old nomenclature is symbolised by an elderly man with the face of the former General Secretary of the USSR, Brezhnev, covered by the Lithuanian national flag and sound asleep. The image suggests that Communist Party candidates aimed to retain the old order, after having repainted it in national colours. The poster design was painted in gouache.",
