They occurred all over India, but were particularly associated with Central India, especially the town of Jabalpur, today in Madhya Pradesh. Whether all the gangs designated as Thugs were members of a sect devoted to Kali, or merely thieves, is not clear. The term became a household word in England during the 1830s, when Sir (then Captain) William Sleeman undertook to supress 'Thuggee'. Colonel Meadows Taylor's popular novel 'Confessions of a Thug' (1839) also helped make the practice familiar in Britain. Models, paintings and posed photographs showing thugs and their activities were made for British patrons and museums during the 19th century.",
