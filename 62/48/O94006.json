            "public_access_description": "A distinctive form of ornament on the pages of manuscripts developed in the southern Low Countries just before 1480 until about 1550. It is known as the 'Ghent-Bruges' style. In this, realistic flowers, fruits, insects and birds were painted in trompe-l'oeil ('to deceive the eye') on gold grounds. Objects are sometimes simulated lying on the surface of the page, disregarding the layout. In some cases, traditional grotesques and jocular scenes are integrated into the scheme. The main impact, however, was no doubt intended to lie in the hyper-real quality of the flowers and other elements.\n\nSome people have seen symbolic meanings in these flowers. But they do not appear to have the active symbolic role of such flowers as the lily in the Annunciation or the flowers and fruit depicted with the Virgin and Child in 15th-century Netherlandish painting. It is known that in some regions cut flowers were scattered on the altar, just as on the dining table at feasts.",
