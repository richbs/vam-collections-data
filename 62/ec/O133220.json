This dish was thrown and carved before being given a thick green 'celadon' glaze, which has pooled in the incised decoration and carved fluting. \n\nThe four fish were made separately in moulds and applied to the unfired glaze. They turned red when the dish was fired. A chip on the rim reveals the contrast between the smooth glaze and the granular texture of the underlying stoneware.",
