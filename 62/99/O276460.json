Here the design was as popular as it was versatile and could be extended to cover all sizes of surface and provided a good base for carpets. Similar designs are seen on the floor tiles in Qavam House, also known as Narenjestan e Ghavam, a traditional and historical house of an upper class merchant family in Shiraz, Iran, built between 1879 and 1886, by Mirza Ibrahim Khan. The Qavam were merchants from Qazvin.",
