The cost of the hand-painted decoration probably restricted the use of such wares to relatively prosperous households. They would have been used at afternoon or after-dinner tea when guests were present, or may have been personal luxuries used by wealthy individuals when taking tea in private. However, Wedgwood listed 'Etruscan cabinet cups and saucers' in his catalogue of 1779, and it may be that his teawares of this type were partly for display.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe cup and saucer are made of Black Basalt, a type of fine-grained stoneware. This is impervious to liquids, although some Basalt teawares were glazed to prevent staining. In 1772 Wedgwood hoped sales of his Basalt teawares would benefit from the women's fashion for white hands, as the black pottery would make them look paler still. Wedgwood called the painting on these pieces 'encaustic'. The name was originally applied to an ancient Greek and Roman technique of painting using hot wax. Wedgwood's encaustic decoration was hand-painted in a mixture of enamel pigments and slip (a mixture of clay and water), and then fired on to the body.",
