They frequently also gave further rings as souvenirs to their friends. The practice came to an end when the office was abolished by the Judicature Act of 1875. New mottoes were chosen at each call; the rings differing in value according to the rank of their recipients. The rings were generally gold with a suitable motto inscribed around the outer hoop although some early examples appear to have been enamelled.\n \nThis ring is inscribed 'Lex est Arma Regum' (Law is the armour of kings) and made for the general call of 1555. It is believed to have been made by the goldsmith Nicholas Deering.",

This ring was bought by Sir John Evans at Sotheby's (June 24, 1898 -lot 359). \n\nHistorical significance: From at least the fifteenth century, candidates called to be admitted to the ranks of Serjeants-at-Law (from whom judges were appointed) were required to present rings bearing an appropriate legal or patriotic motto to the monarch and various dignitaries. They frequently also gave further rings as souvenirs to their friends. The practice came to an end when the office was abolished by the Judicature Act of 1875. New mottoes were chosen at each call; the rings differing in value according to the rank of their recipients. The rings were generally gold with a suitable motto inscribed around the outer hoop although some early examples appear to have been enamelled.\nThe custom of giving rings is described by Sir John Fortescue around 1470 in 'De Laudibus Legum Angliae' as follows: all serjeants at their appointment <font -i>\"shall give rings of gold to the value of forty pounds at the least, and your Chancellor well remembreth that at the time he received this state and degree, the rings which he then gave stood him in fifty pounds\"</i> (De Laudibus Legum Angliae c.59). A full description of the investiture ceremonies and a list of mottoes up to 1765 was given by Mr Serjeant Wynne in <font -i>Observations touching the Antiquity and Dignity of Serjeants at Law</i>, 1765.\nThis ring dates from the general call of 1555 and was made by Nicholas Deering (information given by Dr J.H. Baker to Claude Blair in 1976, from annotation in register).",
