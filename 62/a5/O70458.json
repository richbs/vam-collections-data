According to the legend of the saint, he gave bread from his convent to the poor. When he was accused by a fellow monk of stealing the convent's bread his robes were searched, and the bread miraculously transformed into roses. The rose petals can be seen in his robes here. This painted terracotta group is typical of the work of the Spanish sculptor Luisa Rold\u00e1n, also known as La Roldana. She was the daughter of the sculptor Pedro Rold\u00e1n, and probably trained with him in Seville, before moving to Cadiz, and then in about 1688 to work at the Court in Madrid. Her husband, Luis Antonio de Arcos, painted her polychromed sculptures. Rold\u00e1n also carved full-size figures in wood, such as the St Gin\u00e9s now in the J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles.",
