The sensation of the ballet was the Mazurka d'Extase, in which Perrot as the demon, Rubezahl, forced Grahn, as the wood nymph Eoline, to dance with him against her will and the print captures 'the despair with which she falls into the arms of her tormentor.' \nIn the second half of the 19th century, no self-respecting house was without a piano and a flourishing music publishing industry fed the need for new music.  The covers were often decorated with lithographed images, which reflect many aspects of Victorian life and culture.  Performers whose images appeared on related music sheets became familiar names to people who never saw them on stage.",
