Although individual pieces rarely date back any earlier than the 19th century, the designs are very old, and European observers liked to find traces of Roman or Phoenician influence.\n\nEarrings in the 19th century were particularly large, and are sometimes mistaken for bangles today.  Plain hoops like this, decorated only with numerous silver marks, are typical of Libya, but were also worn in Tunisia and the western oases of Egypt such as Siwa.
