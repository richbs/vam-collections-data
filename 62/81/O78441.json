Although the first silver teapots date from the late 17th century, by the time this teapot was made in the 1770s, the object was a familiar one in many households. A wide choice of material, including cheaper ceramics and glass as well as inexpensive metal products such as Sheffield plate and tinned copper, expanded the market for tea wares. A silver teapot was the most expensive of the available products. In 1740, for example, a Mrs Code ordered a tea service for \u00a358 10s 6d from the goldsmith George Wickes, including a teapot for \u00a36 5s.\n\nPeople\nThis teapot was made by the Swedish-born silversmith Andrew Fogelberg (born about 1732; died about 1815), who was established in London by the 1770s. His Church Street workshop was near that of the gem engraver and modeller James Tassie (1735-1799), and it is probable that he relied directly on Tassie's glass paste reproductions of classical gemstones for his models.\n\nDesign & Manufacture\nWorking either alone or in partnership with Stephen Gilbert, Fogelberg made silver which can be distinguished by its high quality of workmanship and an elegant, restrained classicism. This teapot demonstrates the style through the uncluttered straight-sided form and minimalist decoration of beaded borders and medallions surrounded by an area of plain silver.",
