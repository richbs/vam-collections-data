The two outer windows on the first floor have curved segmental pediments, and those on the ground floor have supporting volutes.  An escutcheon is just visible on the right hand corner with a lion's head with a ring in its mouth above.  The two string courses are dentilled and there are ashlar quoins at all levels.\n\nThis drawing is part of the Vanbrugh Album from the Library at Elton Hall. The Album contains 254 drawings and includes works by Sir John Vanbrugh, Sir Edward Lovett Pearce, William Talman, Nicholas Hawksmoor, Richard Castle and anonymous draughtsmen in Vanbrugh's office. It was created ca. 1945-54 and was purchased by Victoria and Albert Museum in 1992.",
