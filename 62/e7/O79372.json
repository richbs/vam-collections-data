Although individual pieces rarely date back any earlier than the 19th century, the designs are very old, and European observers liked to find traces of Roman or Phoenician influence.\n\nThese penannular rings were originally part of a pair of fibulae, or ring brooches, of a kind that would have been very familiar to the Romans.  They would originally have had a long pin attached loosely to the ring.  After the Romans left North Africa ring brooches continued in use by women in all the countries of the Maghreb up to the mid 20th century.  They were worn in pairs to fasten to fasten the woollen dress which was the main outer garment.",
