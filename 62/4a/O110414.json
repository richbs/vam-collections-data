Within this line are four corner pieces and a central medallion of plain linen embroidered with well-shaded naturalistic floral motifs. The remainder of the ground, including the valances, is Italian quilted with a complicated repeating design of interlaces compartments with coiling stem finials and stylised leaf or shell technique.\n\nOne corner of the linen backing is stamped with the name 'WILLIAM MENZIES'.",

It is, in fact, unfinished, as the edges are raw, parts of the quilting are incomplete and it has never been backed.\nThe cover is currently on loan to the National Trust and displayed at A La Ronde, the house built by Jane and Mary Parminter in the 18th century.\nThe image attached is a details of the centre of the cover.",
