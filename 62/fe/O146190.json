In doing so, he laid the foundations of modern photography. Calvert Jones learned of these developments in 1839 through a neighbour who was a cousin of Talbot. Jones lived in South Wales and he made many photographs there and in the West of England. He also travelled widely, making photographs on the continent. Jones' work stands out in the early development of photography because he was one of the first to apply a schooled artist's eye to the medium\n\nJones often used strong architectural forms to provuide a dramatic setting for figure studies. The strongly lit columns provide a backgrounds of  contrasting vertical bands of light and dark. The group of three colums towards the left segment of the composition emphasise the fugures at their base.",
