His ideas were fuelled by French colonial and trading links with the Far East and a strong demand in France for exotic luxury goods from Asia. His pieces, although eastern in overall style, were recognisably European in origin. \n\nThe rectangularity of this cabinet and the decoration on the doors are inspired by Japanese examples, whereas the form and carving of the legs, including the gilt-bronze dragon mask, are based closely on 19th-century furniture imported from China and Vietnam. \nThe cabinet bears Viardot's signature and the date 1888, marking it as one of his later productions. In 1889 he won a gold medal for his furniture at the Paris International Exhibition, following  the award of a silver medal in 1878 and four medals in 1867.",
