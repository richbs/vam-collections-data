Each of the figures is frontally posed, and the backs are poorly finished, so they were probably intended to be seen against a wall. They may have been displayed set out on a chimneypiece or other domestic furnishing. This figure has previously been attributed to both the Bow and the Longton Hall porcelain factories.\n\nPeople\nThe Vauxhall porcelain factory was run by Nicholas Crisp (born about 1704; died 1774), a merchant and owner of a jewellery shop in the City of London, in partnership with John Saunders, a delftware potter. Crisp was also a founder and very active member of the Society of Arts. The modeller of these pieces has not been identified. However, the Neo-classical sculptor John Bacon (1740-1799) was apprenticed to Crisp and is said to have modelled for the factory. On the other hand, it is known that the Vauxhall factory employed a modeller and mould-maker named Hammersley, who later worked at Plymouth, where these figures of the Continents were also manufactured.",
