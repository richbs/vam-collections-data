            "public_access_description": "This tankard is in the style of the late seventeenth century, although somewhat awkward in style, recalling the work of Fran\u00e7ois Du Quesnoy and was probably made in the Netherlands; the ivory relief set into the lid, rather than a crowning figure forming a knop, is unusual, although it seems authentic.\nFormerly in the collection of Josiah Wedgwood, it is an exceptional example of a baroque ivory owned by this influential British potter, who did not, as far as is known, normally collect ivories. Wedgwood did however produce a few wares in black basaltes in the 1770s which incorporated putti in the style of Du Quesnoy, an indication of the taste of the time.",
