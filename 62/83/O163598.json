These were immensely popular and other factories rushed to capitalise on the new style. In 1898 Adrian Jonker, a potter from Gouda, and Egbert Esti\u00e9, from Purmerend, established E.Esti\u00e9 & Co. In 1903, under new owners, it became NV Plateelbakkerij Zuid-Holland, Gouda. While, initially, Rozenburg's production was expensive, others like the Zuid-Holland wares were much less so and in time their commercial success forced Rozenburg into less expensive production too. This vase is printed with the name of Liberty & Co..  Wares like this were sold under the name 'Breda' exclusively through Liberty's and the Zuid-Holland pottery is believed to have been the manufacturer. It specialised in ceramics richly decorated with motifs based on flowers and leaves, in a generally art nouveau style.",
