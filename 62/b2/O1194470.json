Each year a doll would be produced to represent the winner of the competition. This one is the 1984 winner, Vivienne Rooke who was 22 years of age from Weston-super-Mare. \n\nThe doll was originally purchased by the owner at the small cost of \u00a31.25, showing how mass-produced products like these were. Fashion dolls were originally made in the 1860s as a stylish representation of elegant young ladies, with the majority being produced in France and made from bisque. However, the boom of the 20th Century saw a change of pace in the doll world and novelty toys came into style. Some reflected political changes whilst others reflected a particular trend of the time. The Miss United Kingdom Doll is an example of dolls being made in response to a trend, in this case, the winner of a beauty contest. A label on the box even reads, 'As seen on TV' to emphasise this point.",
