In the lower right hand corner there is evidence that the end continued with white weft. Groups of 8 warp ends have been twisted together to form a fringe. Upper: incomplete; one band of hooked lozenges as the lower end and then narrow bands in red, blue and dark brown weft and then evidence of a second band of hooked lozenges.\n\nDESIGN: Field with a squared niche with a very light brown ground. A vertical line of small diagonal coloured blocks extends from near the bottom to near the top where it finishes under a 'capital' in light red and dark blue. Complete and incomplete horizontal lines terminate in flowers with jagged petals in blue and light purple and in light red and black. Within the niche the horizontal lines and flowers are reduced in size. Along the length of the vertical central line there are pairs of brackets. In the field, where the horizontal lines are broken, the outer section also bears a flower. Through the field are scattered geometric and S-motifs, mirrored from left to right. A line of stylised flowerheads surround the main design. The very light brown edge of the field reciprocates with dark blue to form a running dog pattern. On either side of the niche is a rectangular panel with a very light brown ground with 8 and 1/2 bands of botehs, alternating direction.\n\nDividing these rectangles from the field are three borders:\n\n(1) inner: very light brown ground with a central dark blue stem with pairs of triangles in various colours.\n(2) middle: diagonal angular interlocking S-motifs in various colours.\n(3) outer: light purple ground with a series of guls quartered in blue and white around a black and red quartered diamond.\n\nThere are 2 borders around the entire carpet:\n\nInner: light purple ground with a central black stem on which there are triangular 2-headed figures.\nOuter: narrow band with black ground and small red and light purple S-motifs.",
