This version follows the style of the 1908 issue with its attractive 'tiled' logo. The map is more geographically accurate than Henry Beck's famous scheme (see original design, E.814-1979 and two printed versions, E.815, 816-1979), but even so, this has been modified to improve its legibility by flattening the Metropolitan line to accommodate the text box.",
