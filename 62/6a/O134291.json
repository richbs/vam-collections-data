As she describes it: 'The morning papers are full of scenes of jubilation in Trafalgar Square from the day before, as London wins the Olympic bid. The winning presentation to the Olympic committee gives a sunny impression of a harmonious, multicultural city, with children radiating athletic potential for 2012 (despite reports of childhood obesity in Britain all year).'\n\nThis cartoon, and upbeat reports about the Olympic bid victory, had to be removed from later editions of the Evening Standard as the news came in that suicide bombers have attacked tubes and trains in central London.\n\n'Marf' drew daily topical cartoons for the Evening Standard between March 2002 and August 2005, moving to the Londoner's Diary page in August 2003. The drawings cover key political and social issues of the period, providing a vivid and often hilarious response to the main news of the day. The Evening Standard is London's only evening newspaper, publishing up to five editions a day. In Marf's own words: 'The cartoonist needs to keep up with the rapid pace of event.'",
