The twenty-two children (fourteen boys and eight girls) are arranged in four rows, and are accompanied by three women (one in nurse's uniform) who are presumably  the class teacher, head teacher, and matron.  The boy seated in the  middle of the front row holds a board marked \"Class III\": these  children are probably the \"remove\" class of their school, pupils with  difficulties or disadvantages of some kind (for example, one boy has a  calliper on his leg, another is in a wheelchair, and Peggy Joyce was a  delicate child who had a weak heart).   Peggy is shown sitting in the second row, and is the second girl from  the left: a thin child with a pointed face, and short wavy hair cut in  a fringe.  She wears a loose white tunic dress with a belt, and her  hands are clasped loosely in her lap, with the left wrist and part of  the left hand bandaged.",
