He was billed as \u2018the popular comedian\u2019. It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre of Varieties, Hanley. He compiled them in a series of albums.\n\nJ. W. Hall was a Yorkshire comedian, singer and songwriter. He was well known for his songs, \u2018John James 'Enery Irving Wilson Barrett Baggs\u2019 and \u2018She Thinks She\u2019s Wilson Barrett\u2019. Each song ridiculed a well-known contemporary actor-manager - Henry Irving and Wilson Barrett respectively. Hall appeared at the Grand Theatre of Varieties at Hanley every year from 1903 to 1907, when he was described as \u2018a delineator of everyday characters\u2019. He is seen here in three of his characters, including the cricketer \u2018Captain Scratch\u2019.",

Hall the song-writer and music hall performer who was well-known for two songs which ridiculed well-known contemporary actors - 'John James `Enery Irving Wilson Barrett Baggs' and 'She Thinks She's Wilson Barrett'. This caricature comes from the second album of caricatures in a collection of albums owned by the Theatre Museum compiled by the graphic artist George Cooke.  It is labelled by the artist 'Geo Cooke HYS BOOKE' and features music hall performers working in the early 20th century.\n\nJ.W. Hall 'The Inimitable Comedian; a Delineator of Everyday Characters' appeared at the Grand Theatre of Varieties, Hanley on 29 February 1904 when he was on the bill with Griff, also one of Cooke's subjects. During the week of 13 March 1905 he was at the Empire Theatre of Varieties, Hanley. He was engaged in Hanley again during the week of 16 April 1906 when he was at the Grand Theatre of Varieties, singing two songs: 'one about a tram and one a parody on 'The Wooden Hut' song.' {<i>Staffordshire Sentinel</i>, 14 April 1906)",
