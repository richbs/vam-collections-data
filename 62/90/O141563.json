As a Kuanyama of the Ovambo people, living on the border between Namibia and Angola, Muafangejo used the medium of the linocut to address the region\u2019s history of conflict and the daily struggles and aspirations of its people.\n\nMuafangejo\u2019s linocuts take the form of densely packed narratives, accompanied by a running commentary identifying themes and figures. Scenes of everyday life from people in both rural and urban environments form the basis of many of his narratives as do scenes inspired by his Christian faith such as this one. In Muafangejo\u2019s images biblical stories are set in a firmly African context. This image of Noah\u2019s Ark, for example, includes many African animals amongst the menagerie on board. Muafangejo died in 1988, the same year in which a major travelling retrospective exhibition of his work opened, held in twelve venues across South Africa and Namibia.",
