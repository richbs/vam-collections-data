This tour of stadiums was entitled Who Put the Boot In. The illustrations of the band on the visor were drawn by bassist John Entwhistle and featured on the cover of their then most recent album, The Who By Numbers. The gig played at Charlton Athletic is noted in the Guinness Book of Records as being the loudest concert ever played, measured at 120 decibels. They received rave reviews, despite heavy rain and fighting in the crowds.",
