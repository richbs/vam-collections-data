The linear treatment of the figure is emblematical of his vigorous style, and reminiscent of his caricatures for the satirical journal <i>Le Charivari</i>. \n\nThis drawing draws from a recurrent thematic in Daumier\u2019s career: reading activity, which shows the figures absorbed in his reading. The choice of this subject matter recalls such 17th century Flemish paintings as Vermeer\u2019s compositions. \n\nThe sketch is connected to a large series of drawings: <i>Le Lecteur (Le liseur debout)</i> (Rotterdam, Museum Boymans-van Beuningen), <i>La Lecture (Le liseur assis)</i> (location unknown) and the finished oil painting <i>Le Liseur</i>, c. 1863-65 (Des Moines Art Center, The Nathan Emory Coffin Collection). The sketch is also linked to another oil painting showing a full-length lawyer reading a paper: <i>L\u2019Avocat lisant</i> (Winthertur, private collection, about 1868-70).\n\nDaumier was most celebrated during his life time for his satirical and anti-monarchist illustrations rather than his paintings and drawings. This sheet is a good example of Daumier\u2019s observation of the French society and its professional categories. He did a few series of sketches focusing on different categories such as musicians, comedians, art collectors, rustic life, saltimbanques\u2026",
