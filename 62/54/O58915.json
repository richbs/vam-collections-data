They became much longer in order to achieve the fashionable long and slender silhouette. Corsets had to be rigid to conceal the layers of underwear, including chemise and petticoat, which were worn beneath. \n\nThis corset is cut from separate pieces and reinforced with leather. Strips of covered whalebone form the scaffolding of the corset. Whalebone is strong whilst flexible and therefore ideal for moulding the body of the corset and its wearer. It created a cage around the torso, incarcerating the upper body and accentuating the bust and hips. \n\nThe steel busk defined the front of the garment. On this corset the spoon-shaped busk is wider at the bottom than the top. This was supposed to equalise pressure on the abdomen, making the corset more wearable.

In order to achieve the fashionable slender silhouette, they became much longer. Corsets also had to be rigid to conceal the layers of underwear, including the chemise and petticoat, which were worn beneath. \n\nThis corset is cut from separate pieces and reinforced with leather. Strips of covered whalebone form the scaffolding of the corset. Whalebone is strong yet flexible and therefore ideal for moulding the body of the corset and its wearer. It created a cage around the torso, enclosing the upper body and accentuating the bust and hips. \n\nThe steel busk defined the front of the garment. On this corset the spoon-shaped busk is wider at the bottom than the top. This was supposed to equalise pressure on the abdomen, making the corset more wearable. In reality, it could make it more restricting as the corset could be pulled in more at the waist.",
