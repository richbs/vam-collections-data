Indeed, design of this type constantly occurs on the majolica of the period 1490-1530, and its introduction, particularly into Northern Italy, is probably due to the School of Squarcione (1394-1474) and his illustrious pupil, Mantegna.\nThe design is quite in the spirit of the Italian Renaissance, with its reckless borrowing from classical antiquity, but infusing new life into the old classical details of acanthus leaves, sphinxes and cupids.\n\nAquisition register names Sandro Botticelli as the designer, now rejected. The design featrures in a list from 'Drawings by Old Masters: chiefly Italian School, [Samuel] Woodburn Collection, sale [4-6] June 1860.'",
