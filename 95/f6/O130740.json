The 'negative' area is then planned and carefully drawn on the inside of the bowl. The seven spaces are cut out with a piercing saw using very fine sawblades fed through 0.6 mm pre-drilled holes. All cut edges are then filed straight.\n\nThe bowl is sand blasted all over in order to de-grease the surface before patination. Two layers of patination chemical are applied with a soft brush. The bowl is finally waxed and polished to seal the patina and to give the surface a subtle shine.",

The 'negative' area is then planned and carefully drawn on the inside of the bowl. The seven spaces are cut out with a piercing saw using very fine sawblades fed through 0.6mm pre-drilled holes. All cut edges are then filed straight.\n\nThe bowl is sand blasted all over in order to de-grease the surface before patination. Two layers of patination chemical are applied with a soft brush. The bowl is finally waxed and polished to seal the patina and to give the surface a subtle shine. \n\nCare:\n\nPlease dust with dry or slightly damp cloth. The 'negative' area is delicate can easily get destorted if not packed carefully. Avoid wearing rings when handling,  though any scratches to the surface can be repaired (by me...)",
