This piece was found at Tell Minis, which has given its name to high-quality wares similar to earlier Egyptian pottery.\t\t\n\nThe technique of lustre decoration on ceramics was first developed in Iraq in the 9th century. Technical advances in lustre decoration made in Cairo were taken east to Syria in the 12th century.\n\nPotters used the lustre technique to make their wares shine like gold. First they made a glazed vessel or tile with little or no decoration in the normal way. When the piece had cooled, a design was painted over the glaze in metallic compounds. The pot or tile was then fired again, this time with a restricted supply of oxygen. In these conditions, the metallic compounds broke down, and a thin deposit of copper or silver was left on the surface of the glaze. When polished, this surface layer reflected the light.",
