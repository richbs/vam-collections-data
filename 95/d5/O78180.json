Printed borders were used to conceal the heads of the tacks and to give a neat and finished appearance to the papered wall. The fashion for using borders continued even when methods of hanging wallpapers changed and borders were no longer strictly necessary.  By the early 19th century borders were available in elaborate designs to use as a frieze decoration around the upper part of the room.\n\nPlaces\nThis wallpaper border was apparently made especially for the Drawing Room of Crawley House, Bedfordshire. It was probably designed to suit a decorative scheme in the Egyptian style, which was popular at this time.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe border is printed with alternating motifs of a sphinx (a mythological winged lion with a woman's head and chest) and a sarcophagus (a coffin).",
