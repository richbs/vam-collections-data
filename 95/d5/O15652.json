The maker's name 'Reville and Rossiter', is stitched to the wide, petersham waistband along with a name tape with 'Mrs H. Pearson'.",

Tassels were an extremely popular decorative motif at the time. Here the designer has wittily juxtaposed a trompe-l'oeil image with real tassels.\n\nMrs Pearson wore this lavish gown for her 1922 portrait. She ordered it from Reville and Rossiter, a London couture house appointed court dressmaker to Queen Mary. Two buyers from Jay's department store founded it in 1906. Miss Rossiter was in charge of administration and Mr William Reville was the designer. Once it gained the royal warrant in 1910, it was almost automatically patronised by leading London society. In 1911 Reville and Rossiter designed the queen's coronation robe. By the end of the 1920s the firm had gone into decline and in the late 1930s merged with Busvine.",
