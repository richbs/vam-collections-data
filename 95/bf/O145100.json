Organised by London County Council (LCC) with the newly founded Arts Council, from an idea first mooted by art enthusiast and chair of LCC's Parks Committee, Patricia Strauss, the exhibitions' aim was to take contemporary sculpture out to the non-gallery visiting public. \n\nThe 1948 show was the first open air sculpture exhibition in Britain, and probably in the world, and attracted over 170,000 visitors. It led the way to more permanent open air sculpture museums being established in Britain and abroad. Sculptor Henry Moore was active in the organising committee and his sculpture of three standing figures was one of most well used images in publicity for the show. The 1948 publicity shot featured Moore, Strauss and Health Aneurin Bevan in a similar pose to the sculpture.",
