De Ram was best known for his maps and atlases, some of which were issued using the maps of other geographers, and some of which he prepared himself. Similarly his engravings were informed by the accounts of early European explorers to Africa and the New World.\n\nThe Dutch were slow to develop trading interests in Africa but, following a series of conflicts with Portugal, gained possession of a number of slave depots on the West African coast. Responding to a labour shortage in the newly conquered sugar plantations of northern Brazil in 1630 the Dutch slave trade took off and by 1650 thirty thousand slaves had been dispatched to Brazil from West Africa.\n\nEuropean support for the transatlantic slave trade relied on a popular perception of African people as primitive savages. This engraving by de Ram appears to endorse this perception by depicting two swarthy black men wearing animal furs. One kneels by a fire above which a severed white human leg roasts on a spit. The other carries another leg across his shoulder.",
