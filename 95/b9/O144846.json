The designer, Mary Little, was interested in the use of dress-making techniques applied to upholstery. She designed this chair to highlight how the fabrics used hang, like clothing, from the foam-covered form beneath. This particular chair was completely cut, sewn and assembled by the designer, who employed a specialist pattern cutter for later chairs in the series.\n\nAfter studying at the Royal College of Art, Little worked in Italy for several design studios, including Memphis, before returning to London to develop her own furniture designs. This chair is called Margr\u00e9t after a friend of the designer's. The Paintings, Drawings and Prints department of the V&A holds numerous sketches, drawings and pattern designs created during the process of designing and constructing this chair. Mary Little subsequently emigrated to the USA.",
