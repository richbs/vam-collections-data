The second is a design for a pendant consisting of a large baroque pearl suspended from a dragon in green enamel with two small amethysts, and another bunch of grapes (clustered amethysts) hanging from the baroque pearl.  On a smaller hexagonal piece of paper affixed to the larger sheet is a design for a gold and enamel signet ring showing a wreath sable, and/or a demi-lion rampant or on an azure field.  The album consists of three preliminary leaves of contemporary laid paper (two with unidentified watermarks), forty leaves of vellum and three final leaves of paper corresponding to those at the front of the album.  Inserted are nine sheets of paper and three of vellum bearing designs, notes, transcripts of letters etc.  92 pages, full-bound in contemporary calf skin, gold-tooled, gilt edges, with fragments of green silk ties on the fore-edges of the front and back covers.
