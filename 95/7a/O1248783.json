            "public_access_description": "This etching by Romeyn de Hooghe (1645-1708) is one of a series of fifteen prints of the palace of Het Loo and its gardens. The set includes a panorama of the palace and thirteen prints showing views of different parts of the gardens. They were published together with a description of the gardens, in Amsterdam, by Pieter Persoy. The gardens were famous and inspired many prints and international commentators.\n\nHet Loo was built by Prince William III of Orange (1650-1702) after he became Stadholder of Gelderland in 1672 and with that acquired the hunting rights to the Veluwe.  He purchased the castle of  Oude Loo in 1684 and the new lodge was built in the grounds and completed in 1686. Claude Desgotz (1658-1732) designed the gardens, which also included designs made later by French designer resident in the Netherlands, Daniel Marot (1661-1752) and other artists including the author of these prints Romeyn de Hooghe. In common with seventeenth century European practice the gardens were arranged along a central axis with an almost symmetrical arrangement of parterres on either side. Comments by Romein de Hooghe on his own designs for sculptures of river gods for the garden suggest that water was a dominant feature of the scheme. In the garden there are numerous fountains, canals and cascades, but also  sculptures and fountains representing river gods, fish, dolphins, tritons and swans.\n\nDesgotz was nephew of French garden designer Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre (1613-1700), who designed the gardens at Versailles for the French king Louis XIV between 1661 and 1668. Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre, inspired by earlier French gardeners but also classical and renaissance texts, followed principles such as geometric proportion in nature, the treatment of the garden as an extension of the house, and he added a greater emphasis on order and unity of design linking exterior with interior decorative schemes. Some of this can be seen at Het Loo. Daniel Marot was involved in designs of both the palace and gardens and elements of design overlap between exterior and interior. The parterres en broderie (garden compartments creating patterns from box-hedge and earth, in this period also incorporating clipped and ordered flowers) have the same pattern as found in a stucco ceiling inside the castle; ceiling paintings and silk hangings also incorporate vases found in the garden. \n\nHowever, the unified plan seems not to have been followed for long in the garden. There are also incidental vases and sculptures, references to Hercules and elements reflecting William III's later status (from 1689) as King of England, including canals in the shape of a monogram of William and Mary II. \n\nHet Loo also differed from French gardens in that, while Le N\u00f4tre's designs were characterised by the arrangement of gardens along axes with long and wedge-shaped parterres accentuating length through an illusion of perspective, Het Loo had rectangular parterres that exphasized width. This was a more traditional Dutch practice found at other gardens such as the Huis ter Nieuwburgh. Also, Le N\u00f4tre preferred simplified schemes and used parterres en broderie and flowers sparingly only to accentuate unity of design. The Dutch were renowned for their cultivation of flowers, so in their gardens different flower species were separated within the parterres to showcase them.",
