Originally made for a cope, but later cut to fit a chasuble. \n\nAttention had first been drawn to the collection in March 1898 at which point the embroideries were in  Brussels at Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs. The Museum requested it be sent on approval. (6 April). They were all sewn on two rolls of brown fabric (3 x 2 metres), identified by place of origin, along with some pieces that the Museum did not want to buy. The original asking price for the whole collection was 30,000 francs (\u00a31200). De Farcy wrote to the museum on 26 June expressing his pleasure: 'Cependant je me r\u00e9jouis \u00e0 la pens\u00e9e de savoir mes broderies, que j'ai eu tant de peine \u00e0 collectionner, trouver un honorable asile aupr\u00e8s des merveilles, que votre Mus\u00e9e poss\u00e8de d\u00e9j\u00e0.' He also noted that he had many other pieces that were much less easy to transport and listed them. Correspondence with de Farcy continued for some years.\n\n(RP 23897/1898, 89768/1898, 30355/1898)\n\nHistorical significance: Significant as a relatively rare survival of ecclesiastical embroidery of this period and region.",

Orphrey bands were usually highly decorative, often created through embroidery, with iconography that related to the life of Christ, and includes images of saints and/or apostles. Sometimes the decoration also incorporates references to the patron who commissioned them. Often the orphreys survive when the original garment to which they were attached has been lost, indeed they were recycled over time as the base fabric wore out. The shape usually reveals which particular vestment they were made for - cope, chasuble or dalmatic. Copes required a single long orphrey, and as one side faced the other when worn, the imagery usually corresponded logically.
