In 1594 it was sold to Antonio Salviati, whose family were closely associated with the Medici Grand Dukes of Tuscany.

The 2nd Viscount Astor gave Cliveden and its sculpture to the National Trust in 1942. The group was removed for conservation in 1989, following which it was decided to place it on long-term loan in the Museum, putting a bronze cast in its place.\n\nRaffaello Peri is twice recorded in 1565 as working with Vincenzo de' Rossi, one of the leading Florentine sculptors of the the mid-sixteenth century, but his activities are otherwise unknown. De' Rossi worked for several years in Rome before returning to Florence in 1560, where he was employed by the Medici Grand Dukes. His most notable works from this period are the over life-size marble groups of <i>Hercules and Nessus</i> and <i>Hercules and Cacus</i> (Palazzo Vecchio, Florence). The group was cast in one piece, as described in contemporary treatises, but still a difficult technical achievement at that time for such a large sculpture."

            "history_note": "The Florentine Giovan Vettorio Soderini (1527-1597) bought the work from Peri in 1570. In 1594 it was sold to the Florentine Antonio Salviati (1554-1619), whose family was closely associated with the Medici Grand Dukes, by Soderini\u2019s son Pier Tommaso. There is a drawing in the V&A of a garden design (E.571-1975), which shows a semi-circular screen wall around a central circular basin. In the centre of the courtyard is a fountain \u2013 atop which is the Pluto and Proserpina group (but without Cerberus \u2013 indicating again that it never formed part of the final sculpture). The drawing has now been attributed to Gherardo Silvani and dated c. 1653 by Bostrom. Silvani completed this drawing and many others for Salviati, as can be seen from the coats of arms depicted, and this design was most likely for his residence in Florence as the scale used is in Florentine braccia (equivalent to approximately 59cm).\n\nThe Salviati residence had by 1819 been passed down through marriage and descent to Prince Camillo Borghese (1775-1832), of the Borghese Aldobrandini family. Many alterations were made to the building at this time by Giovanni Baccani, however it is unclear if any changes were made to the gardens.\n\nThere is no record of the Pluto and Proserpina group until it was bought by the future 1st Viscount Astor in 1896 and brought to Cliveden House. The 2nd Viscount Astor gave the house and sculpture to the National Trust in 1942. Having been outside for over four hundred years had led to adverse effects on the condition of the group. The National Trust decided to move the group inside to protect it from further deterioration and replace it with a replica outside. The group was removed for conservation in 1989, following which it was decided to place it on long-term loan in the Museum, putting a bronze cast in its place.\n\nHistorical significance: Antonia Bostr\u00f6m\u2019s two articles in the Burlington (1990 and 1998) go into detail regarding the history and movements of this object, as well as discussing the attribution to Raffaello Peri, who was an assistant of, and may have used a model by, Vincenzo de\u2019 Rossi. The sculpture was once attributed to Giambologna, although there is no documentary evidence for this. The static style of the piece, together with the single viewpoint and the bulky nature of the figures (among other stylistic differences), suggest  a closer association with Florentine sculptors of the 1560s and 1570s. Bostr\u00f6m compared this piece with works by de\u2019 Rossi, most importantly with a stylistically similar marble group of <i>Paris and Helen</i> (in the Grotto in the Boboli Gardens). The hair, flesh and drapery are all treated in a very similar way, as are the facial expressions and the poses of the bodies.\n\nA small bronze group of Pluto and Proserpina in the Bargello in Florence is stylistically similar to the large group. However, because of the sketchy nature of the piece, it could either have been a copy after the full-scale version or a preparatory model. As this small-scale group could not be firmly attributed to one artist, the authorship of the whole group was initially left open to discussion.\n\nHowever, a recently discovered document dated 31 May 1570 makes it more certain that the sculptor was Peri. The document describes the sale of the group to Giovan Vettorio Soderini from an agent acting on behalf of Peri. The document describes Peri as both a sculptor (suggesting artistic responsibility) but also as \u2018Maestro Raffaeollo fabbricatore di esse statue\u2019 which implies a less important role in the making. A date for the sculpture of c.1565, previously assigned by Bostr\u00f6m, still stands.\n\nPluto, in Greek mythology known as Hades, is the God of the Underworld. There are few myths about him, the main one being his marriage to Proserpina (Persephone in the Greek myth), daughter of Ceres, the Roman goddess of spring and plenty (identified with Greek goddess Demeter). According to Ovid, having been struck by Cupid\u2019s arrow, Pluto saw Proserpina and carried her away to the underworld. In this sculpture, Proserpina is shown with a crescent moon diadem, associating her with the Goddess Diana with whom Proserpina is sometimes identified.\n\nThe contents of the 1570 document also make clear that Pluto\u2019s many-headed dog, Cerberus, was not part of the original composition \u2013 despite it\u2019s presence in the small scale version in the Bargello.",

            "production_note": "", 
            "historical_context_note": "Unfortunately there is no documentary evidence as to who commissioned this group, and where it was meant to be placed.\n\nGiovan Vettorio Soderini was well known for his architectural and botanical treatises, the most well known of which is the <i>Trattato della Coltivazione delle Viti e del frutto che se ne pu\u00f3 cavare</i>, published posthumously in 1600. His properties in Florence were well known for their botanical gardens, and he was also apparently an accomplished amateur architect designing fortified villas, fountains, a casino and a villa. He was very interested in the inclusion of sculpture in garden designs, both free-standing but also as part of fountains. It is most likely these interests that led him to purchase this work. Bostr\u00f6m writes that Soderini, in his <i>Trattato degli Alberi</i>, recommends that water should travel through canals in the garden before emptying into a great fishpond with a large statue in the centre which would take up the water and shoot it out on all sides. He also wrote in this treatise that water is \"the soul of cities and gardens [anima delle ville e degli orti]\".\n\nHe had close links with the Medici family through his wife, Maria del Senatore Leone de\u2019 Nerli, whose paternal grandmother was a sister of Maria Salviati, mother of Cosimo I. For a full discussion of Soderini\u2019s life and a bibliography, see D.M. Manni\u2019s <i>La Vita a Giovan Vettorio Soderini</i> (Florence, 1878). \n\nAs can be seen from the V&A\u2019s drawing for the Salviati garden, the group was intended to be part of a fountain. At Cliveden House, it stood on a stone plinth in the parterre (ornamental flower garden) at the end of the formal garden behind the house.",
