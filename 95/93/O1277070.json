In 1945 Amies established his couture house on Savile Row and was renowned for his fine tailoring and elaborate ball gowns. It is still operating today. He was vice Chairman and founder member of The Incorporated Society of London Fashion Designers established in 1942 and Chairman of the society from1959-1960. Amies was commissioned to make clothes for the young Queen Elizabeth II for her tour of Canada in 1950 and was awarded the Royal Warrant in 1955. \n\nThis gown is a good example of Amies evening wear and includes many of his signature features, a full skirt, low waistline, fine satin and appliqu\u00e9 diamante decoration, which is dense at the top and disperses down the bodice extending down the skirt.  The full skirt is supported with a thick paper-like Vilene material which Amies used as an economic alternative to layers of tulle during the war and which he continued to use long after many of his contemporaries.\n\nThe gown was made for the Honourable Lady Waley-Cohen, wife of Sir Bernard Nathaniel Waley-Cohen, who was Lord Mayor of London 1960-61. Lady Waley-Cohen wore the dress for the Lord Mayor\u2019s Inaugural Banquet in November 1960.",
