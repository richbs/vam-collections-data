            "public_access_description": "Balenciaga was the most exclusive fashion house in Paris immediately after World War II. The Spanish-born couturier Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga (1895-1972), regarded by his peers as \u2018the Master\u2019, had moved to Paris from Spain in 1937. By 1952 he had 232 employees there and was producing 356 new designs per year. His clients, admitted to his salon only after a personal introduction, included many cosmopolitan women of different nationalities. Gloria Guinness (1912-80), who donated this dress to the V&A, was one of Balenciaga\u2019s most loyal customers.  \n\nThe style of this dress reflects the exaggerated padded hip shape of the \u2018New Look\u2019 made famous by Balenciaga\u2019s contemporary, Christian Dior (1905-57).  However, its sombre black, and pared down design is very typical of Balenciaga, who was inspired by Spanish religious dress and the paintings of clerics by Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n (1598\u20131664).",

Born in Mexico as Gloria Rubio, her first husband was a Count Furstenberg, to whom she was married at the behest of the German art collector, Freddy Horstmann.  Her second husband was an Egyptian by the name of Fakhry, and her third husband, the banker Loel Guinness.  In many ways she was unhappy as his wife, as she loved to party and he did not.  She gave an enormous number of items from Balenciaga, Dior, Courreges, Lanvin Castillo, Givenchy, and Jeanne Lafaurie, proving that she spread her commissions amongst many different couturiers.  Among the 17 outfits, 12 hats and pairs of shoes that she donated were a <b>1948 Balenciaga evening gown (T.16-1974) of organdie with flack flowers</b>, a 1949 hand-painted evening gown by Marcelle Chaumont (T.92-1974), and a 1950s evening gown by Jeanne Lafaurie (T.281-1974), the only dress by that designer in the V&A's collection.",
