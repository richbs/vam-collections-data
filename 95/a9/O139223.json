            "public_access_description": "This portrait shows Kabuli Mehmed Pasha (1812-1876), a high-ranking official of the Ottoman empire. In 1850, when the portrait was painted, Kabuli was an attach\u00e9 at the Ottoman embassy in London. During his stay in the city, he met and courted Giulietta Anichini, a young Italian woman. Kabuli presented her with this portrait, which he inscribed modestly in French as, Plus heureux que l'original, \"More pleasing than the original\". Kabuli's suit was unsuccessful, for in 1853 Giulietta wrote to tell him that she had married a fellow Italian, Alfonso Scalia.\n\nKabuli wears a European-style uniform, with an order at his neck, and on his head is a red felt fez. The combination of uniform and fez became the standard formal dress for Ottoman officials under Sultan Mahmud II (ruled 1809-1839). At the same time, it became the custom for court artists to paint miniature portraits of the ruler for distribution as gifts. This is a rare example of a miniature portrait by a court painter of one of the sultan's subjects.\n\nThe painter of this miniature signs himself in Ottoman Turkish as Rupe. He can be identified with Rupen Manas, a member of an Armenian family of painters who enjoyed the patronage of Mahmud II's son, Sultan Abd\u00fclmecid (ruled 1839-1861).",

In 1852, she married Alfonso Scalia, a Sicilian, and moved with him to Palermo.

He would never have allowed a female member of his family to converse with a man, but while living in London he courted a beautiful Italian woman and presented her with this portrait. This exemplifies the type of mixing of cultures that is the subject of a great deal of Middle Eastern literature of the later 19th and 20th centuries.",
