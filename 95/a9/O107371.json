Because of the pose of the arms, raised almost vertically, the sculptor has been able to fashion the figure from one piece of ivory, following in broad terms the shape of the tusk. The head however has been carved separately and added. \nThe large ivory figure is typical of the Christian ivories produced in Goa on the West coast of India, when it was under Portuguese rule. Local artists specialising in ivory carving made such pieces, usually under the direction of Portuguese missionaries. Most of these ivories were made as luxury items for export to Europe, although some were used to try to convert the local people to Catholicism. Goa was the second base in India to be established by the Portuguese, having been conquered by Alfonso de Albuquerque (about 1453-1515) during the reign of Manuel I of Portugal initially in 1510, and then reconquered in 1512. Portugal was interested first and foremost in trade, and the discovery of India was motivated by a desire to dominate trade-routes.",
