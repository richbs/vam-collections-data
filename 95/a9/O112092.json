Other sketches included Glen Byam Shaw as the Prince, Leonide Massine as the Spielmann, Lyn Harding as the King, Maud Allan as the Abbess, Ivan Brandt as the Knight and Tilly Losch as the Nun. These sketches were exhibited at a gallery in London's Chapel Street in 1932, while the production was running.  This drawing was either given or sold to Oliver Messel who designed the costumes for the 1932 revival.  He gave it to an assistant when moving to Barbados and she in turn presented it to the museum.\n\nThe Miracle grew out of C.B. Cochran's request for a show to fill the vast spaces of the Olympia exhibition hall in London. Based on a medieval German mystery play, it was a spectacular epic production which required the performance space to be transformed into the interior of a Gothic cathedral, with towering arches and stained glass windows, and a cast of hundreds. One critic described it as 'theatre without stage or curtain, drama without words, opera without lyrics'. Max Reinhardt directed both the original 1911 Olympia production and the 1932 revival at the Lyceum, using the same Karl Vollmoeller scenario and Engelbert Humperdinck's music.\n\nCochran revived The Miracle to showcase Lady Diana Cooper as the Madonna.  She first played the part in New York in 1924 and so impressed Cochran that he determined she should play the part in London, although it was eight years before his plans came to fruition.",
