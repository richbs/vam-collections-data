Large boxes such as this one may have been used for combs or for gloves. This box is embossed with flowers and has a central cast plaque showing the ancient Greek and Roman myth of  Venus, the goddes of love, and Adonis.\n\nPeople\nA silver toilet service was often a gift to a bride from a wealthy groom. This service is a reproduction of a service (Museum nos. 240&A to M-1879) that was bought for Julia Blackett, the eldest daughter of Sir William Blackett, by her intended husband Sir Walter Calverley. This is recorded in his diary: 'On Tuesday, the 17th of January, 1706-7 I was married to Miss Julia Blackett...I and my mother were at the cost of a fine set of dressing plate for my wife, came to 116l. odd money...'.\n\nRecent research has identified the silversmith, whose mark 'WF' is found on this service, as William Fowle (1658-1684). He was apprenticed to the well-known silversmith, Arthur Manwaring, and went into business independently in 1681. He specialised in making toilet services.\n\nSocial Class\nMatching sets of toilet silver originated in 17th-century France in conjunction with the custom of the lev\u201ae. This was a practice popular among the upper classes, in which friends and family would be invited to witness the dressing and adornment of noble ladies.",

The original casket was stolen from the Passmore Edwards Museum during an exhibition in 1900. A replica was commissioned by the Victoria and Albert Museum in order to fill the gap in the set for display. Schaub and Son undertook to make a high quality reproduction of the surviving casket for the price of \u00a37. Two further copies were made and taken on by the Circulation Department. \nA minute paper from 1919 describes the decision to make a replica: \"Mr Watts, The release of a D case from another purpose at length enables us to devote a case to the display of the Trevelyan (Calverley) toilet service. In order to give it its proper effect, it is necessary to fill the gap left by the casket stolen some years ago when on loan to West Ham Museum. I suggest that we should have an electrotype copy made of the companion casket in the set, to fill this gap and restore the balance of the group. If carefully made and toned to match the other pieces the effect would be quite successful, I think....H.P.
