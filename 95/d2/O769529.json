It was destroyed during the Second World War and has been replaced. Some designs for the furnishing of this church are in the RIBA collections.\n\nAugustus Welby Northmore Pugin (1812-52) is widely considered as one of the most significant and influential architects, designers and theorists of the 19th century. Following his conversion to Catholicism in 1835, he identified the Gothic style with Christian architecture and his work and writings inspired and framed the Gothic Revival. In 'Contrasts', published in 1836, he condemned classical forms and ardently praised 14th and 15th-century architecture. Pugin is best remembered for his work on the Palace of Westminster.\n\nAlexandra Wedgwood,  A.W.N. Pugin and the Pugin Family , London; V&A, 1985, p. 200.",
