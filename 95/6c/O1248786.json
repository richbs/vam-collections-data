He worked in several West End theatres, becoming manager of the Gaiety Theatre and later Daly\u2019s Theatre in the 1890s and early 1900s. Edwardes\u2019 musical comedies introduced new and formulaic stories. He dressed his characters in the height of fashion and accompanied the performance with tuneful undemanding music, romantic lyrics and attractive dancing.\n\nThis item is one of several theatrical drawings from a collection of sketches commissioned from contemporary artists to be printed in illustrated magazines. The collection was donated to the museum by Sir William James Ingram in 1914.",
