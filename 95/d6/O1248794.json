The figures were bought in 1937 were made by the master puppet maker Arthur Quisto (1882-1960), except the two boxers and the ghost, whose maker is not known.\n\nMr Punch was first recorded in England in 1662 by the famous diarist Samuel Pepys when he saw him as a marionette, operated in Covent Garden by the Italian puppet showman Signor Bologna. Pulchinella, as he was then called, was presented within a tent rather than in the type of booth we know today. Pepys brought his wife to see the show two weeks later and that October the same show was performed at Whitehall for the King. \n\nThis is Judy's hat in Gordon Bavister's Punch and Judy show, which Joey brings on to have some fun with Mr. Punch. The hat moves around the stage with Joey hidden beneath it but he gets out  before Mr. Punch hits the hat with his stick. Joey by then is behind Mr. Punch and surprises him before they have a fight.",
