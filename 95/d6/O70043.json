In the foreground, a British couple and their dogs rest under a canopy while a servant fills water pots, and horses and mules are unloaded. Hill porters have brought large paniers full of chickens, ducks and fruit. The artist was George Landseer (1834-78), the nephew of the more famous painter Sir Edwin Landseer (1802-73). George Landseer set out for India in 1859 and is thought to have stayed there for over fifteen years, travelling all over the subcontinent. In 1860, he accompanied  Lord Canning (Governor-General of India from 1856-62) on his tour of Kashmir to escape the hot weather of the plains, and this is almost certainly when the picture was painted.",
