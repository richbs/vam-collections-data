No. VII, fig. 49.\nThe following in an excerpt from a valuation report made by Christie's of the estate of the late Rt. Hon. Viscount Harcourt, K. C. M. G., O. B. E. \"An inscription on the reverse of the miniature states that the sitter is Queen Elizabeth. This, however, seems highly improbable, as the type of attire with elaborate dressing of the hair falling loosely onto the shoulders is typical of the early masques performed for Queen Anne. It is an important miniature in that masques for ladies were rare and none were done after 1613. The miniature may be compared with Isaac Oliver's portrait of Anne of Denmark in the costume for 'Masque of Beauty' (1608), or 'Love Freed' (1611). (See Auberach <u>Hilliard</u>, p. 249, pl. 217) and can be dated circa 1610. The brushwork is contemporary with Hilliard but lacks his and Oliver's finesse. It is, however, interesting, particularly in the use of the black background, being employed by Hilliard on only one occasion (see Roy Strong, '<u>The English Renaissance</u>', p. 114, pl. 96) where it was used to signify constancy.\"",
