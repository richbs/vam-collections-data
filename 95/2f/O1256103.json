The sailor suit is blue with skin coloured hands and feet (which have been discoloured). The doll has a white cotton shirt with blue threading and a small rope neck tie sewn underneath the shirt, which is also attached to the main body of the doll. There is also a black cotton strip attached to the front of  the shirt, hanging down the doll's neck. The head is a composition head, using glue and sawdust, with painted red cheeks, lips, black eyebrows, eyes and eyelashes. Attached to the head is a white cotton sailor hat with a black rim. \n[Accordion] The accordion's main body is made from folded black paper, glued to a rectangular wooden block at either end. The wooden blocks have a pin sticking through them. On one block there are five rounded pins along the sides of the block with a hole on one side. On the other there are just four pins. The accordion has two cotton black straps attached to the pins, which then attach to the doll itself.",

This doll has a composition head (made from glue and sawdust), which was a common material used to make dolls heads during the 1920s, through to the 1940s. Unfortunately there is no distinct maker's mark, which implies that the doll is a copy from the larger doll companies which manufactured the composition dolls at the time. Sailor dolls were usually marked with the name of a particular ship. The SS Hamburg was a German ocean liner owned by the Hamburg America Line, built by the Blohm &amp; Voss Shipbuilders of Hamburg, Germany and launched in 1926. She became a naval accommodation ship for the German Navy in 1940. On 7 March 1945 during the evacuation of the forces from the Eastern Front, she struck a mine and sank.",
