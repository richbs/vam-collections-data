Educated as a classicist at Edinburgh Royal High School and University, and from 1803 worked as a clerk in the Excise Office. After his father's death, he went to London 1806, and entered the RA Schools with Sir David Wilkie. Returned to Edinburgh 1808, worked 1810-14 as a portrait painter, but soon after settled in London. Exhibited 100 works, mostly portraits, at the RA between 1806 and 1845, 28 (mainly landscapes) at the BI 1818--42, and 15 at the RSA 1836-45. He held a one-man show of 70 works in Edinburgh in 1821. Visited Paris 1814 to study in the Louvre, Italy 1828-30, and Holland 1839. Elected ARA 1832. Mainly known for his portraits, but also for 'fancy' pictures, religious paintings (he painted an altarpiece of the 'Ascension' for the church of St James, Garlick Hill, London ECl) and copies of old masters. He was also an accomplished etcher, particularly landscapes in the style of Rembrandt. Married 1827 Adela, daughter of the miniature painter Nathaniel Plimer. Died Berners Street, London, 5 May 1844. A posthumous sale of his work and collection was at Christie's 8 April 1845. His self-portrait of about 1815 is in the SNPG. \n\nLIT: [Adela Geddes, the artist's widow] <i>Memoir of the late Andrew Geddes Esq.</i> ARA 1844; <i>Art Union</i> 1844, pp291-2 (obit); D Laing <i>Etchings by Sir David Wilkie and by Andrew Geddes ARA with Biographical Sketches</i> Edinburgh 1875; R Brydall <i>Art in Scotland</i> 1889, p232; C Dodgson 'The Etchings of Andrew Geddes' <i>Walpole Society</i> V, 1915-17, pp19-45; W Martin 'Andrew Geddes, ARA', <i>Connoisseur</i> 1935, pp334-8 \n\n<b>A Man Smoking</b> \nFA75 Neg E29 \nPanel, 38.1 x 30.5 cm (15 x 12 ins)\nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nNot identifiable with any exhibited work, and clearly influenced by, if not a copy of, 17th-century Dutch painting in the 'guardroom' genre.
