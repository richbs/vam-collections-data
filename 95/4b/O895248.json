The temple, built to honour the first Roman emperor, was built somewhere between 2 BC and 14 AD. The drawing was done as part of a group which was commissioned to show a series of views of the Dalmatian and Istrian coast including historical monuments, ruins, and landscapes. \n\nThe commission for this series of works was given to Cassas by a group of amateurs under the patronage of Emperor Joseph II in 1872. Probably started en plein air and then finished at a later time, the drawings were not engraved until much later under the direction of chief engraver Fran\u00e7ois Denis N\u00e9e (1732-1817). Cassas was known to create an under-drawing with sepia while at the site and would then add watercolour and ink detailing over the sketch at a later time. He used this technique in the creation of his other travel series from his journeys to Constantinople, the Middle East, Asia Minor, and the Greek Isles. \n\nThe drawing is an original for an etching found in Voyage pittoresque et historique de l\u2019Istrie et de la Dalmatie, complied by J. Lavall\u00e9e and published in two volumes in 1802. It was published as plate number 25. A description in the back of the book tells about the stone and marble used to construct the monument. The book has a total of 69 plates, 61 of them views engraved after Cassas\u2019 watercolours, several of which are in the V&A collection. Alongside the etchings, the book\u2019s text details the history of Istria and Dalmatia and also gives an account of the sites, much of which was taken from Cassas\u2019 travel journals.\n\nKnown for his travel drawings, such as this one, which were later engraved and published in books, Cassas\u2019 style as an illustrator was admired in his lifetime as being true to life and lacking in personal emotion creating an ideal documentation. He did however often add foliage and lush vegetation to his images of ruins as a way of satisfying the longing for an intensely classical age. This coincides with the 18th century belief that nature was ideal, especially when removed from the influences of civilization. In addition to bare landscapes, his drawings were often inhabited by figures. Trained as an ethnologist and archaeologist, he was believed to inspire the Neo-Classical style of architecture in the early 19th century.",
