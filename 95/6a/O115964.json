He was a designer at Lachasse from its opening in 1928, and launched his own couture house in 1930. He introduced ready-to-wear in 1939.  \n\nAfter working in America between 1953 and 1957, in 1958 Morton became Design Director of the London firm Reldan-Digby Morton, which produced casual sportswear.\n\nMorton specialised in fashionable tailoring and country clothes, like this outfit. Sometimes he teamed his tweeds with Aran knitwear.",

The styling and colours were highly fashionable and entirely characteristic of Morton's preference for muted tones.  The jacket was made by Morton's tailor, Roger Brines, whilst the pleating of the matching dress involved the skills of an external workshop.  A specialist company such as Ciment of Gilbert would have pleated the quarter circles of sun-ray pleats of the skirt (an expensive process which cost about \u00a312), and the fine green leather belt, which matches the dress perfectly, would have been ordered  from an exclusive leather company such as Madame Crystal.  What is perhaps unusual about this ensemble is the absence of distinctive pockets - Morton adored pockets and he used them imaginatively and profusely.",
