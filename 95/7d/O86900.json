It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years. Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nHugh Wakefield made his first appearance on stage as a ten-year old boy in April 1898 at the St James's Theatre in Days of Old.  He appeared regularly on the London stage as a child, amongst other productions in Shockheaded Peter at the Garrick Theatre, 1900, and Bluebell in Fairyland at the Vaudeville,1901. After serving in the army from 1914 to 1920 he returned to the London stage and made a great success as Count Hubert de Linancourt in Bluebeard's Eighth Wife which opened in October 1922 and ran for over a year at the Queen's Theatre. He started his film career in 1930, appearing in several films including The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934), Blithe Spirit (1945) and The Million Pound Note with Gregory Peck, Ronald Squire and Wilfred Hyde-White",
