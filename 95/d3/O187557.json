As a designer he is most notable for his sculpturesque metalwork, especially cast iron stoves and fireplaces, decorated profusely with figures, foliage and architectural motifs of a Renaissance flavour. His masterpiece was the interior of Dorchester House, London (1858-62, demolished 1929) for which he painted ceilings and designed chimney pieces, doors etc., some of which are now in the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool.",

His masterpiece was the interior of Dorchester House, London (1858-62, demolished 1929) for which he painted ceilings and designed chimney pieces, doors etc., some of which are now in the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool.",
