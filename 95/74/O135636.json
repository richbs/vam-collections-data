The Queen was known as an avid collector who favoured jewellery, fans and miniature furniture \u2013 for which she commissioned several dolls\u2019 houses, as well as objects with a royal association.  However, she was also one of the earliest collectors of Victorian decorative arts such as papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 and embroidery, many examples of which she loaned or donated to the V&A for its Victorian galleries. This stool, with its Berlin work seat, is a good example of just the sort of decorative domestic object that appealed to the Queen.  \n\nBerlin work or woolwork was a type of embroidery which became popular during the nineteenth century.  Often used in upholstery, it was also used to decorate slippers and small household objects.  The name for this type of work is derived from the type of wool used for it.  Berlin wool, also known as Berlin yarn or German wool, was a high quality worsted yarn spun from combed wool, with a harder twist than other yarns.  This made it more durable and therefore particularly suitable for this type of embroidery.",
