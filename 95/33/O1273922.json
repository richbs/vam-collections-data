Brown's masculine inspiration was, however, contrasted with a feminine sensibility in cut, colour and use of fabric as this dress exemplifies. Together with an ensemble (also designed by Sheilagh Brown) consisting of a frock coat (T.47:1-2013), a pair of striped trousers (T.47:2-2013), a black and white floral-printed shirt (T.47:3-2013), a pink shirt (T.47:4-2013), a spotted scarf (T.47:5-2013) and a silver brooch (T.48-2013), this dress was acquired for, and displayed in, the 'Club to Catwalk' exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum.",
