He died of a heroin overdose at the age of 21, shortly before the poster was issued. The poster shows a skull floating directly above his head.\n\nTrojan was a close friend of performance artist, club promoter and fashion designer Leigh Bowery. Bowery and Trojan shared a council flat in the East End, which appears in Charles Atlas's film about the dancer Michael Clark, 'Hail the New Puritan' (1986). Trojan is said to have cut off his ear and lipsticked the stub, as a new style statement for his regular appearances at the nightclub Taboo.\n\nJohn Maybury began his career designing sets for Derek Jarman's 'Jubilee' (1977), and worked with Jarman on 'The Last of England', 'War Requiem' and 'The Tempest'. He quickly became a leading figure in the British underground film scene, and also made a number of music videos in the 1980s, for performers including Everything But The Girl, the Smiths, and Boy George. This poster was produced for the exhibition 'Anti-Art Fair', which included work by Wilma Johnson, Timothy Prus, Angus Cook and others, showing his continuing involvement with the art world even as he became increasingly involved in more commercial work.",
