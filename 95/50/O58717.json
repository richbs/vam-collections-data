The original production was conducted by Mario Bernardi; directed by Colin Graham; and lit by Charles Bristow.  The production was later revived at Sadler's Wells in January 1966 and March 1967; and at the London Coliseum in February 1969 and November 1970.  The designs were later revised by Alix Stone for performances at the London Coliseum on November 4th 1971, and September 1972.",
