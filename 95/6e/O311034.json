The gadrooned base is separate, the joint concealed by a metal band; an oval cover in the base can be removed to reveal the hollow interior of the flask. The base may be made out of walrus ivory; this is suggested by its crystalline surface. Four kings are represented on the sides: 1: a king holding a sword and pointing to the head of a whale; 2: a king holding a sceptre and sword; on his breast are the arms of Norway (a lion rampant, crowned, holding in his paws a battle axe); 3: a king in armour, holding a sword over his right shoulder; 4: a king in armour, with the Star of the Garter on his cloak. An old paper label inside the flask, inscribed in handwriting probably dating from the late nineteenth or early twentieth century, identifies the monarchs as Christian IV, Magnus Olaffsen, Hakon Hakonsen and Olaf Trygrasson, that is, Christian IV, King of Norway and Denmark (1577-1648), probably no. 4, and three kings of Norway: Olaf I (960s-1000), probably no. 1; Magnus II (1048-1069), probably no. 3; and Hakon IV (1204-1263), probably no. 2.",

Four kings are represented on the sides: 1: a king holding a sword and pointing to the head of a whale; 2: a king holding a sceptre and sword; on his breast are the arms of  Norway (a lion rampant, crowned, holding in his paws a battle axe); 3: a king in armour, holding a sword over his  right shoulder; 4: a king in armour, with the Star of the Garter on his cloak. An old paper label inside the flask, inscribed in handwriting probably dating from the late nineteenth or early twentieth century, identifies the monarchs as Christian IV, Magnus Olaffsen, Hakon Hakonsen and Olaf Trygrasson, that is, Christian IV, King of Norway and Denmark (1577-1648), probably no. 4, and three kings of Norway: Olaf I (960s-1000), probably no. 1; Magnus II (1048-1069), probably no. 3; and Hakon IV (1204-1263), probably no. 2. \nSince three medieval Norwegian kings are combined with one seventeenth-century king of both Denmark and Norway, it seems likely that this piece dates from the mid-seventeenth century, before the death of Christian IV in 1648. The subjects similarly suggest it was almost certainly made in Denmark or Norway, which would also accord with the style of carving.",
