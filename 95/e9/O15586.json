He showed clean-cut clothes that included trouser suits with immaculately cut straight legs and streamlined jackets. The look was dubbed 'Space Age'. It was created by using heavyweight gaberdines by Nattier, an Italian manufacturer, and other heavy fabrics that maintained the rigid lines. This flared, daisy-patterned shift reflects the Courr\u00e8ges look in the mid 1960s. A Courr\u00e8ges house photograph shows a bronzed young model in a geometric haircut wearing an almost identical dress (model number 54). She wears short white gloves, long white socks and flat, wide-toed bar shoes.\n\nThis dress was worn by Princess Stanislaus Radziwill. It forms part of the Cecil Beaton Collection. This Collection was brought together by the society photographer Sir Cecil Beaton (1904-1980). With great energy and determination Beaton contacted the well-dressed elite of Europe and North America to help create this lasting monument to the art of dress. The Collection was exhibited in 1971, accompanied by a catalogue that detailed its enormous range.",
