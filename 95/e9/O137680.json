Krizia collections are renowned for their eclecticism, but also their distinctive, clever and light-hearted designs such as this knitted jumper with animal print. The house branched out into knitwear in 1967 and the following year began experimenting with their signature animal motif. Each collection by Krizia is created under the influence of a lucky animal charm, which began with the humble sheep in 1968, shown on a sweater almost jokingly as if to thank it for its wool; to swans, tigers and cobras in 1978-79 and the highly-copied leopard's paw on the shoulder in 1980. \n\nThe American press called her \"Krazy Krizia\" for her highly original and often ironically provocative clothes. Speaking about taking her inspiration from animals, Mandelli said: 'For me they perform spells. I put animals everywhere, on sweaters, on clothes and accessories; but more than love them I'm slightly in awe of them, frightened of them. I admire their beauty and natural elegance of movement, their indifference yet I fear them as unpredictable and mysterious creatures. I prefer them in affectionate interpretations, slightly ironical as cuddly toy animals often are. (Tutino Vercelloni, Isa, Krizia. Una storia, Milano: Skira editore, 1995.)\n\nOver fifty collections a year are created for the various Krizia labels, including menswear, childrenswear, knitwear, glasses, handbags, ties, perfumes, kitchen furniture and much more. There have been a number of different designers in charge of design but Mariuccia Mandelli is still very much a hands-on designer at her house.",
