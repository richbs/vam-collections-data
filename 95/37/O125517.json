            "public_access_description": "Charles Le Brun (1619-1690) was born in Paris and soon achieved a great success becoming the court painter of Louis XIV. He trained with Fran\u00e7ois Perrier (1594-1649) and then collaborated with Simon Vouet (1590-1649) during the mid 1630s. He made a decisive trip for his artistic development to Italy with Nicolas Poussin (1594-1665) in 1642 and returned to Paris only three years later. He then became quickly very successful and produced many history and religious paintings as well as designs for the royal palaces. \n\nThis painting is a fine example of Charles Le Brun\u2019s Baroque style who dominated 17th-century French painting. It shows the Descent from the Cross of Christ\u2019s body by Nicodemus and St John the Evangelist while a group of mourning women gathered around the feinted Virgin Mary. This austere composition is pervaded with dramatic intensity enhanced by touches of vivid colours against the dark background. This work, of which several versions are known, was particularly popular and inspired the next generation of artists.",

London: 1973, pp. 167-8, cat. no. 206.\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\nCharles LEBRUN (1619-90) \nFrench School \nBorn in Paris, he was a pupil of Simon Vouet in 1634-37 and as early as 1638 he was appointed Peintre du Roi. In 1642 he went to Rome with Poussin and remained there until 1645. Back in Paris in 1646, he became a founder member of the Acad\u00e9mie Royale in 1648, <i>Premier Peintre du Roi</i> in 1662 and, in the following year, through the patronage of Colbert, director of the <i>Manufacture royale des Tapisseries et des Meubles de la couronne</i>. In this position he played a very influential part in the designs for the decorative arts and he has been described as the creator of the Louis XIV style. \nLit. H. Jouin, <i>Charles Lebrun et les arts sous Louis XIV</i>, 1889; <i>Charles Le Brun</i>, exhibition catalogue, Versailles, 1963. \n\n206 \nTHE DESCENT FROM THE CROSS \nCanvas \n31 x 25 (78.7 x 63.5) \n9103-1863 \n \nAcquired as by Sebastian Bourdon (1893 <i>Catalogue</i>, p. 176), this painting was recognized by Jennifer Montagu as a version of Lebrun's <i>Deposition</i>. Other versions, differing only in the absence of the tree and ladder on the left, are in the National Gallery, Prague, and in the Museum at Saint-Germain-en-Laye; a much smaller version was sold in 1845 from the collection of Cardinal Fesch and has since disappeared (<i>Catalogue des tableaux de la galerie de feu S. E. le Cardinal Fesch, par George</i>, 3rd pt, 1844, no. 371-1193). There is an engraving, showing the composition in reverse, by Francois de Poilly (repr. Montagu, 1968, fig. 2, see below). \nDr Montagu points to the influence of Annibale Carracci and suggests a date c. 1642-45 during Lebrun's stay in Rome. She contrasts the dramatic intensity of this early work with the more academic and formalized treatment of the same subject in the late 1670s (National Museum, Stockholm), leaving open the question of whether these versions are by Lebrun himself or whether they are workshop replicas of a lost original. \n\nCondition. The brown ground is showing through where the paint has become worn, especially on the body of the thief, at the sky to the left of the cross and on the figures in the lower left corner. Clearly the principal figures - Christ, St John, the Virgin and the Centurion - were painted in heavier, more brilliant colours, contrasting with the thinly painted, shadowy figures in the middle - and background. \nProv.

He was in particular a prolific painter of religious scenes and as such, he illustrated at least four 'Depositions'. \n\nThis painting is a typical example of Le Brun's Baroque style in which a great emotional tension goes together with an intense austerity. 1091-1863 shows the influence of the Italian school on the 17th-century French art, especially Annibale Carracci (1560-1609) for the austerity and the colour scheme as well as Savoldo whose veiled Mary Magdalene in the National Gallery, London, may have inspired the veiled mourning figure above the Virgin Mary. \n\nMoreover J. Thuillier (1963) pointed out the similarity of the group of the Virgin to that in Annibale Carracci's small <i>Crucifixion</i>, formerly in the Giustiniani collection, Rome, while the compositional idea of the shroud underlining the pale glow of Christ's body, continued in St John's drapery, is reminiscent of Rubens' <i>Deposition</i> in the Antwerp cathedral (1612-14). The subdued colours enlivened by bright areas of red and blue also recall the Flemish palette. \n\nA version in The National Gallery, Prague (Inv. 056), was tentatively dated around 1647-48, just after his return from Italy, while a second version currently catalogued 'school of Le Brun' is in the Museum at St-Germain-en-Laye near Paris (Inv. 872-1-2). \n\nA third version from the collection of the cardinal Fesch was sold in 1845 and has since disappeared. \n\nThe present version was dated by Montagu from around 1642-45 on the ground that it shows the important influence of Italian models and may therefore have been executed while Le Brun was still in Rome.",
