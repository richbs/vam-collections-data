In this example she is unusually represented in a passive mode, holding the trident (trisul) and drum which identify her allegiance to Siva.\n\nA good quality high-relief, thinly cast image.  The four-armed goddess sits cross-legged on a simple rectangular base, holding  a damaru drum, trident, bowl and shield, with a fine pieced \"halo\" framing her head, within a three-lobbed arch.  Two small holes filled with copper ner the bottom suggest that this was once nailed to a wall.  There is an engraved third eye.  Brassy colour, moderate wear. \nDecca/W.India, 1750-1825.",
