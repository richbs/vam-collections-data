            "bibliography": "Iotti, Alessandra Bigi. <i>The Burlington Magazine</i>. \"Andrea Sansovino and the design for a funerary monument for Leo X\". No. 1268, Vol. CL: November 2008, pp. 757-759.\nThe following is an extract from the text of the article:  (8621 is figure 51 in the article) \n\nThe collection of the Gabinetto Disegni e Stampe of the Uffizi contains a considerable number of designs for funerary monuments dating from the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries. About 190 drawings related to such monuments are noted by Pasquale Nerino Ferri in his <i>Indice geografico analitico dei disegni degli Uffizi</i>.1* There is no catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of these drawings and, while some have been discussed in monographic studies on individual artists, a considerable number of the sheets are still categorised as anonymous works. One of these sheets (Fig.48) is the subject of this article.2* Listed by Ferri in his <i>Indice</i> as 'Anonymous sixteenth century', the drawing, a fragment in a very bad state of conservation, has never been published before. Yet it matches the upper part of a drawing, a <i>Design for a funerary monument for Leo X</i> in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London (Fig-49), 3* attributed to Andrea Sansovino and dated to 1521 by Ulrich Middeldorf. 4* \n\nThe two designs, identical in their form, style and architecture, are virtually on the same scale. Although it is mutilated and badly damaged, the Uffizi sheet has the freshness and freedom of execution of an original drawing rather than of a copy. In all probability we are dealing with two projects by Sansovino for the pope's tomb, one fragmentary but <i>probably</i> original; the other more intact but perhaps later. 5*\n\nAs is well known, the sepulchral monuments of Leo X and Clement VII in S. Maria sopra Minerva, Rome, one of the great sculptural undertakings of the sixteenth century, were commissioned in March 1536 from Baccio Bandinelli. 6* The project recorded in the V. & A. drawing was never realised. The lower part of this ambitious study (it was evidently also present in the Uffizi sheet before it was cut) consists of a grandiose architectural base articulated by four pilasters surmounted by a frieze of metopes and triglyphs (in the Uffizi sheet only two metopes are indicated while in the V. & A. drawing metopes are indicated along the whole length of the frieze). In the V. & A. sheet a pair of allegorical female figures, probably representing Faith and Fortitude, appear on either side of a large central inscription: here Leo X's name appears preceded by the first nine letters of the alphabet. This type of inscription suggested to Middeldorf the possibility that this was not made as a result of an official commission for the project, but rather could have been made by Sansovino in the hope of obtaining the commission for the tomb while the pope was still alive or immediately after his death in 1521. 7* \n\nThe sudden death of Leo X, on the other hand, occurred at a moment of religious and political crisis; the election to the papal throne of the pious and austere Hadrian VI in 1522 was an attempt to remedy the intrigues and factionalism in the Vatican and throughout Europe. In these circumstances, it would have been difficult to commission a grandiose monument to the memory of a Medici pope. It was only after the elevation of Clement VII, another Medici, to the pontificate in 1523 that it was deemed appropriate to erect a monument to Leo. \n\nIn both drawings a pair of seated Virtues turn towards the sarcophagus at the apex of the monument. These figures have a strong affinity with the seated Virtues carved by Sansovino on the Monument of Cardinal Ascanio Sforza in S. Maria del Popolo, Rome, of 1505-07 (Fig.50)8* and, as Middeldorf noted,9* with Sansovino's drawing of Astronomy in the Uffizi. Finally, the figure of the deceased pope, semi-recumbent like an Etruscan tomb figure, can be compared to that in a drawing by Sansovino also in the V. & A., a design for a funerary monument for a cardinal (Fig. 51), 10* which shows the dead man wearing a mitre, leaning on his elbow and with his legs crossed. \nThis particular position of the dead man, 11* defined by Valone 12* as 'between waking and sleeping', derives from ancient funerary art, both Etruscan and Roman. Interpreted in the light of a new philosophy of life and a new attitude to death, it seems to have been used for the first time in the cinquecento on Sansovino's two tombs in S. Maria del Popolo and subsequently became the standard form, from Sansovino's tomb of Cardinal Sant' Angelo in S. Marcello al Corso to Peruzzi's tomb of Hadrian VI in S. Maria dell' Anima. As Middeldorf noted, the London drawing constitutes a parting of the ways between a tomb type characteristic of the early Renaissance, indebted to medieval prototypes, in which there was a strong interdependence between architectural and sculptural elements, and the new type of funerary monument of the sixteenth century in which, as in Classical art, architecture and sculpture coexisted independently. \nThe London design and the fragmentary sheet in the Uffizi constitute an important marker in the evolution of the forms of Renaissance funerary art. The effigy of the dead man assumes a new significance, tied to the cult of personality. Not many sixteenth-century tombs were commissioned by their patrons while they were still living and constructed under their supervision. The new role of the portrait, often, significantly, shown with open eyes, and the innovative, so-called 'Etruscan' pose of the body confer on the effigy the semblance of life and the hope of eternity. \n\n[by Alessandra bigi Iotti]\n\nFootnotes:\n\nThe present article is taken from my thesis, 'Progetti di monumenti funerari del XVI secolo nelle collezioni del Gabinetto Disegni e Starnpe degli Uflizi' (Universita di Bologna, Dipartimento Atti Visive, 2006), which was supervised by Prof ssa Marzia Faietti, whom I warmly thank for her counsel and support. \n\n1*\nPasquale Nerino Ferri, curator in the Gabinetto Disegni e Stampe degli Uffizi from 1879, compiled an inventory of the collection, listed by arrist and giving titles, dimensions and useful notes; P.N.

Volume One. 14th-16th century</i>, Victoria and Albert Museum Catalogues, London 1979, p. 147-48, fig. 312.\n5*\nAs Marzia Faietti suggested to me, the minimal differences in the upper part of the two drawings could also point to a variation on the project; in fact this would be possible even in the case of a design that was not in the strict sense a presentation drawing to a client, but a drawing made, as is probably the case with the present drawing, to obtain the commission. However, it could be that we have here two different projects with variations.\n6*\nD.

Maria del Popolo, as was the V. & A.'s study for the tomb of Leo X (inv. no.2260), also from the Talman collection\n11*\nHuntley, <i>op. cit.</i> (note 4), p.60, identified medieval prototypes in England and Spain; but the most important link was to Etruscan funerary art; in Sansovino's monument, as was emphasised by S. Valtieri: 'Il \"revival\" etrusco nel Rinascimento toscano', <i>L'Architettura</i> 194 (1971), p. 548, <i>'il corpo dello Sforza ha un movimento vicino alla mimica espressiva delle jigurazioni etrusche e, come i difunti etrusthi, non e rigido e disteso, ma su di un fianco, abbandonato ad una rilassatezza edonistica</i>'. On the rediscovery of the Etruscans see G. Cipriani: <i>Il mito etrusco nel Rinascimento fiorentino</i>, Florence 1980. \n12*\nC. Valone: 'Giovanni Antonio Dosio: The Roman Years', <i>The Art Bulletin</i> 58 (1976), p. 533; the type of the effigy of the dead man underwent variations on Sansovino's model during the course of the century, differences that are barely noticeable in the work of Jacopo Sansovino, but more marked in the final project for Michelangelo's Julius tomb. There, the pope's alert body is stretched out, his torso turned to the front while his face is bent forwards towards his hands.\nPeter Ward Jackson, &lt;u&gt;Italian Drawings&lt;/u&gt;, London, HMSO, 1979. Sansovino, Andrea Andrea Contucci (1467/70 - 1529) 311 Design for the tomb of a cardinal with the arms of Julius II on top, and a scale underneath. Inscribed in ink in an old hand, probably that of J Talman, 'Giov. Dosio' Pen and ink and wash 14 5/8 x 9 7/8 (371 x 251) Provenance: J Talman (Lugt, Supplement 2884A, which is Talman's mark); bought 1880 from A W Thibaudeau (on whom see Lugt 2473) Literature: U. Middeldorf, 'Two Sansovino drawings' in The Burlington Magazine, 64, 1934, pp. 159-64, and fig. C; G H Huntley, 'Andrea Sansovino', Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1935, pp. 97-101, and fig . 70; Venturi, II, part I, p. 172 and fig. 151; R U Montini, Le tombe dei Papi, Rome, 1957, p.312 and fig. 122. Middeldorf first pointed out that the old attribution to Dosio does not fit the early cinquecento style of the architecture, and he suggested that Sansovino was the artist. A similar design at Weimar, also from the Talman collection, is probably by the same hand (Huntley, loc. cit. fig. 71). Both tombs are surmounted by the arms of Julius II and have other features in common; but the Weimar monument is lower by one storey and the figures on each side of the sarcophagus stand on the podium against the pillars of the arch, instead of in niches. The della Rovere arms suggest a connection with the tombs made by Sansovino at the command of Julius II for the cardinals Girolamo Basso della Rovere and Asanio Sforza in S. Maria del Popolo, Rome; and the tombs themselves bear a close enough resemblance to the two drawings to prove that the connection exists. The drawings presumably represent an early stage in the working out of the designs. They are not necessarily by the hand of Sansovino himself, but might be by an assistant. No. 312, another design for a tomb, also from the Talman collection and inscribed with the name of Dosio, probably comes from the same studio, though perhaps by a different hand.\nNorma e capriccio.
