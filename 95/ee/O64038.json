They are thus an unlimited source of themes for literature, art and the theatre. The Nidana-katha and the Jataka stories are popular subjects for Burmese illustrated books, many of which have found their way into European collections. The style, while owing much to late Indian painting, has unmistakable Burmese characteristics, such as the conventional rendering of a mountain and of architecture, which is treated two-dimensionally, in a way suggestive of theatrical scenery.",
