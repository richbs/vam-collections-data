They celebrate those unnamed dancers who pose and wait, known only from programmes as 'peris', 'nymphs', 'sylphs', 'gipsies', 'townspeople' etc., who provided a decorative background for the great ballerinas and filled in between her appearances.  In Russia, such dancers were called 'les danseuses pr\u00e8s de l'eau'(dancers near the water), as they stood against the backcloth on which a fountain was often painted; in Paris they were nicknamed 'les petits rats' (the little rats) because they looked half-starved and were always nibbling something.  The English title may come from an 'operatic choreographic burlesque Sketch' called 'The Pet of the Ballet', produced in London in the 1840s.",

They celebrate those unnamed dancers who pose and wait, known only from programmes as 'peris', 'nymphs', 'sylphs', 'gipsies', 'townspeople' etc., who provided a decorative background for the great ballerinas and filled in between her appearances. There were eight prints in the series, published by Rudolph Ackermann, of which the Rambert-Dukes collection has four - Nos 2, 3, 4 and 5. \nThe print is part of the collection of dance prints amassed by Marie Rambert and her husband, Ashley Dukes in the first half of the 20th century.  Eventually numbering 145 items, some of which had belonged to the ballerina Anna Pavlova, it was one of the first and most important specialist collections in private hands.  \nRambert bought the first print as a wedding present but could not bear to give it away.  As the collection grew, it was displayed in the bar of the Mercury Theatre, the headquarters of Ballet Rambert, but in 1968, Rambert gave the collection to the Victoria and Albert Museum; seven duplicates were returned to Rambert, but these are catalogued in Ivor Guest's A Gallery of Romantic Ballet, which was published before the collection came to the V&A.  Although often referred to as a collection of Romantic Ballet prints, there are also important engravings of 17th and 18th century performers, as well as lithographs from the later 19th century, by which time the great days of the ballet in London and Paris were over.",
