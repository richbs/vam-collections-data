Between the 1660s and 1690s both  men and women wore extravagant displays of lace as a mark of wealth and status. The showiest effects were achieved with lace worn at the throat and at the wrist, setting off the face and hands. A fashionable man might even trim his boot hose with matching lace borders. In an attempt to protect the English lace industry, a royal proclamation was issued in 1662 forbidding the import or sale of foreign lace. The Royal Family was exempt from this prohibition, and it also seems to have been flouted by members of the court and other fashionable people, because Venetian needle lace continued to be freely sold and worn in London.",
