The restaurant wanted to change its style of menu from a standard photographic design to an illustrated menu which converyed the notion of good traditional English food but in a colourful and lively way. The menu was designed so that the cover and special menu could be changed each season. Mercer therefore provided a series of wood engravings wittily illustrating the names of the dishes. For an example of Mercer's original artwork see E.752-1994.",
