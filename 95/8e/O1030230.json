Some alterations have been made to the lines of decoration below the figure. The stained glass in the House of Lords, except for a sample window by Hardman, was made by the Edinburgh firm of Ballantine and Allen between 1847 and 1850 from the designs of A.W.N. Pugin.\n\nAugustus Welby Northmore Pugin (1812-52) is widely considered as one of the most significant and influential architects, designers and theorists of the 19th century. Following his conversion to Catholicism in 1835, he identified the Gothic style with Christian architecture and his work and writings inspired and framed the Gothic Revival. In 'Contrasts', published in 1836, he condemned classical forms and ardently praised 14th and 15th-century architecture. Pugin is best remembered for his work on the Palace of Westminster.",
