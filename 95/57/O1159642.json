Richard, one of her nephews, designed the first jointed teddy bear in 1902. This design was perfected in 1905. The company became the leading exporter of bears from Germany with Britain and the USA its biggest customers. Today, the company still maintains links with the Steiff family.\n\nSteiff introduced their first penguin, King Peng, in the 1920s after Admiral Byrd's expedition to the South Pole in the 1920s made the headlines worldwide. Many different characters, based on Byrd's adventures, soon filled the toy shops. Steiff also introduced other animals who live in or around water to their production line, such as seals and frogs.",
