The winner is the one who finds out the opponent's position first.\n\nThe game is played by two players.  Each player takes a pad of charts and decides whether he shall be Blue or Red.  He then marks on his chart the positions of his fleet, as follows, by means of crosses:-\nOne Battleship:  four squares\nOne Cruiser:  3 squares\nTwo Destroyers : 2 squares each\n\nThe squares marked must be consecutive for each ship, and must be in a straight line, although they may be placed diagonally, vertically or horizontally.  There must be, however, at least one blank square between any of the ships, and they must not touch each other.  The players must not see each oher's charts and where their opponent's ships are placed.  The cover on which these rules are printed makes a good 'screen'.\n\nThe armament of the vessels is as follows:-\nBattleship:  two guns\nCruiser:        two guns\nDestroyers: one gun each\nThis makes a total for the Fleet of 6 guns or shots.  The object is to sink your opponent's vessels by firing at them.  The Battleship must be hit four times, the Cruiser three times and the two Destroyers twice each.  When two hits have been registered on the Battleship or Cruiser, a gun is lost; thus if the battleship has been hit twice and the Cruiser twice, next time the Fleet fires it can only fire a salvo of 4 shots.  One shot on a destroyer, however, does not disable the gun and it fires until the second hit is registered, when it is sunk.  One hit on any ship does not disable a gun.\n\nMethod of Play\nThe players having marked out their ships, Blue commences the game by firing a salvo of 6 shots at his opponent;s chart.  As there is a slight advantage of having first shot, it is usual to decide by lot who shall be Blue.  Blue opens fire by calling a number and letter indicating a particular square he decides to hit.  He does this 6 times.  He then says to Red, Have It hit anything?  Red then says You have hit my Battleship once and ny cruiser once, or No Hits as the case may be.  He does not say which particular shot he was hit with, but only the ship or ships that were hit and how many times.\n\nEach player, however, marks each shot on their respective charts by placing a figure 1 in each suare fired at.  Red on the chart with his ships on and Blue on the  Red Chart.  It is then Red' turn to fire a salvo of 6 shots or if he has lost any guns, 5 or 4 shots, as  the case may be.  He also marks these shots 1 as does Blue on his chart and then enquires if he has hit anything.  Blue then fires agina, marking his shots 2 this time, followed by Red, who does the same.  The object of marking these salvos with numbers is in order that a player may have some idea where the ship he has hit is placed.  Thus, if blue has hit the Battleship  twice, with a first shot and third shot, he looks on his chart for a combination of these two numbers and knows that this is the approximate position of the ship he has hit.  The squares against the ships at the bottom of the chart are for the use of recording the hits on both one's own and opponent's ships.  A lot of skill can be exercised in finding the position of one's opponent's ships.  The more hits one obtains on the opposing ships the less they are to hit you, as their shots at you decrease.\n\nCopyright H P Gibson & Sons Ltd, London, E C 1\n\n\n\n\n\nRules placement: none",
