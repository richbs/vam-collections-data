            "public_access_description": "This typographic poster advertising the premiere of Jerry Springer the Opera at the National Theatre tells little about the content of the show, but the flames behind the title reveal something of its incendiary nature. Written by the stand-up comedian Stewart Lee, and composed and scored by musician Richard Thomas, in 2004 the show won Best New Musical at the Laurence Olivier, Critics' Circle, Evening Standard and Whatsonstage.com Theatregoers' Choice awards, the only show ever to win all four major 'Best Musical' awards.\n\nJerry Springer, host of the world's most notorious TV chat show, is shot by a guest at the climax of one particularly seedy edition of his show. The Devil seizes the opportunity to solve his problems by forcing Jerry to present his show in Hell, in order to reunite Heaven and Hell, with guests including Jesus, Mary, Adam and Eve, and God himself. The musical is entirely sung, with the exception of Jerry, who has a speaking role.\n\nDespite the controversial nature of the show, the National Theatre production sold out entirely between April and September, before moving to the Cambridge Theatre where it ran for more than 600 performances. Nevertheless, on being broadcast on BBC2 it attracted over 55,000 complaints, the most the BBC has ever received for a single broadcast, due to its profanity and irreverent treatment of Judeo-Christian themes.",
