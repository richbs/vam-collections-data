            "physical_description": "The crowned saint, wearing a cloak over her gown, kneels in prayer in front of the Emperor Maxentius in the centre of the panel. The bearded figure of the emperor, wearing a cloak and tippet over his gown and belt, stands on the right of the panel. He wears a crown with a devil emerging from the top. He holds a sword in his left hand, resting it against his shoulder. Behind the saint, in the doorway of a crenellated prison, stands a gaoler, wearing a flat cap with liripipe, a short gown and belt with a purse hanging from it. In his right hand he carries a bunch of keys attached to a short staff; his left hand rests on the saint's shoulder. In the middle of the panel the executioner, wearing a flat cap, doublet and low belt, holds a falchion in both hands, swinging it above his head. In the top left-hand corner, under the canopy, an angel bears a diminutive crowned head in a napkin, representing the saint's soul. The canopy is an integral part of the panel.\n \nThe right hand of the emperor is broken off. The prison doorway is broken and the right leg of the gaoler is missing. The whole of the bottom of the panel is damaged. The two top corners of the panel are missing and the canopy is damaged. \n\nA considerable amount of gilding survives on the background of the panel, which is decorated with small gesso bosses. There is red on the angel's wings (flecked with white) and red under the canopy (decorated with four gilded stars). There is dark paint on the faces of the executioner and the gaoler. The emperor's beard is brown and there are traces of gilding on his crown. The falchion is brown and the inside of the archway of the gaol is painted black. The back of the panel bears three lead-plugged holes with traces of latten wire.",

            "public_access_description": "English alabaster altarpieces showing scenes from the story of St Catherine survive as far afield as Spain, Denmark, Venice and Vienna.  This panel, showing her beheading, would have come from such an altarpiece.\n\nThe figure on the right represents the Emperor Maxentius - his crown has a devil emerging from the top.  On the left stands the saint's jailer, holding a bunch of keys, while her executioner swings his falchion above his head.  In the top left-hand corner, the small crowned head in a napkin represents the saint's soul.\n\nThe crowned saint, wearing a cloak over her gown, kneels in prayer in front of the Emperor Maxentius in the centre of the panel. The bearded figure of the emperor, wearing a cloak and tippet over his gown and belt, stands on the right of the panel. He wears a crown with a devil emerging from the top. He holds a sword in his left hand, resting it against his shoulder. Behind the saint, in the doorway of a crenellated prison, stands a gaoler, wearing a flat cap with liripipe, a short gown and belt with a purse hanging from it. In his right hand he carries a bunch of keys attached to a short staff; his left hand rests on the saint's shoulder. In the middle of the panel the executioner, wearing a flat cap, doublet and low belt, holds a falchion in both hands, swinging it above his head. In the top left-hand corner, under the canopy, an angel bears a diminutive crowned head in a napkin, representing the saint's soul. The canopy is an integral part of the panel.\n \nThe right hand of the emperor is broken off. The prison doorway is broken and the right leg of the gaoler is missing. The whole of the bottom of the panel is damaged. The two top corners of the panel are missing and the canopy is damaged. \n\nA considerable amount of gilding survives on the background of the panel, which is decorated with small gesso bosses. There is red on the angel's wings (flecked with white) and red under the canopy (decorated with four gilded stars). There is dark paint on the faces of the executioner and the gaoler. The emperor's beard is brown and there are traces of gilding on his crown. The falchion is brown and the inside of the archway of the gaol is painted black. The back of the panel bears three lead-plugged holes with traces of latten wire.\n\nThere are two sorts of alabaster. Calcite alabaster is very hard and was used in ancient times. This object is made of gypsum alabaster which is a fine-grained, soft and smooth stone. Although at first glance it looks a little like marble, which it was intended to imitate, it was much easier to carve due to its softness, and alabaster objects were therefore significantly cheaper to produce. Marble does not originate in England, so it was imported if needed, whereas in the 15th century there were important alabaster quarries in Nottingham, York, Burton-on-Trent and London. England was a major centre for the production of objects such as this one. During period, they were exported in very large numbers to Europe where they survive, unlike many examples which remained in England and were destroyed or greatly damaged during the Reformation.",
