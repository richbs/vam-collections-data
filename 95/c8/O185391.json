At a later date the building became part of Enfield Railway Station.  The station was demolished in 1872; the fa\u00e7ade however was saved, and originally purchased for the Structural Collection of the Science Museum, then part of the South Kensington Museum.\n\nThe acquisition of the fa\u00e7ade is recorded in a contemporary publication about Enfield by Edward Ford. He noted: '...it was taken down brick by brick, with the greatest care, all being numbered and packed in boxes of sawdust for carriage. Nothing could exceed the beauty of the workmanship, the bricks having been ground down to a perfect face, and joined with bee-wax and rosin, nor mortar or lime being used. In this manner the whole front has been first built in a solid block, the circular-headed niches, with their carved cherubs and festoons of fruit and foliage, being afterwards cut out with the chisel....'\n\nSir Christopher Wren (1632-1723) was a designer, astronomer, geometer and one of Britain's greatest architects in history. He designed 53 churches in London, including St. Paul's Cathedral, and many other secular buildings, for example the Greenwich Naval Hospital. He was a founder of the Royal Society, and its President from (1680-82). He also carried out scientific research, and was much respected by Sir Isaac Newton and Blaise Pascal.",
