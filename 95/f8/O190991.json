The image is a detail from a photograph shot by photographer Milan Kincl on National Street, Prague in the days following a brutal police attack against a non-violent student demonstration. People went to National Street to express their solidarity with those who were injured while courageously singing protest songs and holding flowers and banners with the slogan \u2018 No Violence\u2019 against the truncheons in the hands to the \u2018White Helmets\u2019 (as the special troops of the Ministry of Interior Affairs were known). The same slogan \u2018No Violence\u2019 can be seen in the photograph lying among flowers together with a hand written leaflet titled \u2018For All the Victims\u2019.  \n\nMany people, including foreign journalist and TV staff visited National Street to express their support by putting flowers, slogans, leaflets, national flags and money on the spot where the blood of those who had been beaten was still visible on the city walls under the arcade. During the police attack, the students had been trapped with no escape other than to be escorted away by the brutal White Helmets. \n\n\nDesigned, printed and published in former Czechoslovakia",
