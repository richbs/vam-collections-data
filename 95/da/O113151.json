G-Plan furniture was designed so all the individual items would be compatable in style and dimensions. It marked the beginning of modular furniture for the mass market. This little chair was designed to be used with the dressing table unit. G-Plan was marketed at the more affluent end of the market that might be sympathetic to contemporary design ideas imported from Europe. The chests of drawers each cost \u00a319 11s 6d and the suspended dressing table was a further \u00a316 12s 6d, a not inconsiderable sum for new furniture in 1957.",
