The shorter rails of the frame, visible when the table is closed, are of mahogany, each tenoned into a block at one end and jointed with dovetails at the opposite end into a thinner plank of oak, which runs back behind the hinges of the long rails and is nailed to the inside of the fixed half of the rail, completing the box structure of the frame.  The leaves of the top are each set with iron strap hinges underneath, and fold with rule joints.",
