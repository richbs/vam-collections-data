            "physical_description": "Notes by NH June 2005\nWalnut cassone with chip carved front.\n\nDovetailed construction, with solid ends.\nGood iron handles. Lock missing and escutcheon replaced with wooden keyhole.\nDistinctive double ended feet, with repaired mid-sections, and built up below front feet.\nSingle plank lid, with spliced in repairs at PL and PR back and PL front. Originally on three ring hinges of which traces remain (though I can't follow the marks on lid that look like lid supports rubbing over time), now replaced with 2 massive ring hinges\nBase a single plank nailed up with split, and repair PL rear and filler block for a knot. After the base attached, the edge carved to match the carving on the front and look like one single panel.\n\nInside PR an ancient wormy divider of pine wedged in with batten, set into grooves front and rear (survival a bit suspicious) with empty grooves, presumably for a compartment with false bottom. \n\nFront with replaced front section along PR front lower edge. Use of curved and straight chisel blades. Distinctive borders. NB outer panels match, inner ones don't .\n\nSummary \nGood with reasonable repairs - look for analogies. More like 15c than 16c? Emilia possible.",
