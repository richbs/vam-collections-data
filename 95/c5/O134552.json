Entered Government School of Design 1841; headmaster of Schools of Art at Spitalfields 1843, Manchester 1844 and Birmingham 1851. Organised first exhibition in England of art manufactures at Royal Institution, Manchester, and gave first course of lectures on principles of decorative art 1845. Worked on Great Exhibition 1851 and International Exhibition 1862. Visited USA 1853. Appointed to South Kensington Museum 1858, Keeper of Art 1863, retiring a month before he died; promoted the circulation of works of art from South Kensington to provincial museums. Contributed to the Art Journal, lectured extensively, and published several books, from On the Cultivation of a Popular Taste in the Fine Arts (1839) to British Art, Pictorial, Decorative, and Industrial: a Fifty Years' Retrospect (1882). Elected FSA 1878. The catalogue of the 1919 exhibition of his paintings states that he exhibited at the RA and BI; he may be the G Wallis whose only exhibit was a 'View of Cardigan Bay' at the RA in 1872 (several Welsh scenes were in the 1919 show). Died Wimbledon, London, 24 October 1891; his daughter Rosa was a flower and watercolour painter, his sons George H and Sir Whitworth Wallis were directors of the Bethnal Green Museum and then (respectively) the Nottingham and Birmingham Museums. His studio sale was at Christie's 22 February 1892. His portrait by Alphonse Legros is in the V&A collections (896-1892), as is an etched self-portrait (E5750-1906). \nLIT: \tArt Journal 1891, p384 (obit with portrait); Magazine of Art XV, December 1891, p69 (obit with portrait); Catalogue of Works by the late George Wallis ... exhibition catalogue with biographical introduction, Municipal Art Gallery and Museum, Wolverhampton, 1919 \n\nThe Great Exhibition of all Nations, 1851 \n1453-1903 Neg GA1202 \nCanvas, 18.7 X 61 cm (7 ?

The view of the Crystal Palace in Hyde Park is possibly taken from a contemporary print, of which there were many (see, for example, the view reproduced in \nH Hobhouse Prince Albert: His Life and Work , 1983, fig 94, p100). The view is from the junction of Exhibition Road, and gives a vivid impression of the length of the building. \n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
