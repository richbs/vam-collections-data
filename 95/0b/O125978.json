The article states: \"they come from the collection of Captain Tytler who was left in charge of the palace, after the capture of Delhi by the British Troops during the Mutiny and they were later on sold by his widow to the two museums in 1892 and 1908\" .\nThere is no mention of Captain Tytler on the Nominal File (MA/1/F621: Fisher, Rev. F. L), but these papers state that 'the heavy pedestal was one of the four legs of the great marble throne at Delhi. We have, on loan, another of these legs and for this the owner has refused much larger prices than that now asked. It is a very desirable object and I think that if we offered \u00a320 it will be accepted' (C.P. Clarke to Sir Philip Owen, 16 VI [1892]). A letter from the Rev. Fisher to the museum on May 24 1892 stated that he had been in communication with 'the owner of the marble table' who is not named, and mentioned a ' required' price of \u00a325. The final price paid was \u00a320.",
