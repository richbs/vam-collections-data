It is one of the many inlaid bass wares made in Egypt and Syria during the first cenury of Mamluk rule (1250-1350) for Christian patrons.\n\nThe decoration, with its band of silver inlay containing an Arabic inscription, is typically Islamic. The wording, however, states that it was made for 'the reverend father at the monastery of Dayr al-Madfan'.",
