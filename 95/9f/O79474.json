Although individual pieces rarely date back any earlier than the 19th century, the designs are very old, and European observers liked to find traces of Roman or Phoenician influence.\n\nEarrings like these, with a simple pattern of triangles like the teeth of a saw, were worn mainly in Algeria, although they were also worn in neighbouring Tunisia and Libya.  They were described as having the name halak when they were acquired by the Museum in 1904, but this is a generic name for earrings.  They are usually described today by their specific Berber name of timcherreft or mcharraf.",
