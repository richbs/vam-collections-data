No date.   Water mark : Britannia and a Lion within a fence ; motto Pro Patria, Band &amp; Son ; also monogram A P B (?) in a circle ; also mark of J. Whatman (undated) ; and of I. Taylor, about 1785.   Original binding, mottled stiff boards and leather back.\nE.2259-1913.\n\n<b>Summary of Contents.</b>-Furniture fittings of every kind and in other examples.\n\n<b>Comments.</b>-The plates are well executed and in some cases (<i>e</i>.<i>g</i>., plate 115) show a technical treatment of some interest, which certainly suggests the hand of a chaser of brass rather than that of a skilled engraver.   The latter patterns of drop handles and furniture ornaments are of unusual richness. On plate 121, is a representation of the Baptism of Our Lord, with the motto \" Je Jezus despois de Baptizado tirouse immediamente da Agoa, \" which may indicate a Portuguese (?) market.   Favourite devices are the Eagle and a Bunch of Grapes, as well as the characteristic scroll ornament of the Chippendale style.   Plate 128 gives us the information that \" a compleat Commode sett \" consisted of \" 6 Handles and 3 Escut<sup>ns.</sup> to D<sup>o.</sup>, I Frontice piece, 2 Large Ornament pieces and 2 short D<sup>o.</sup>, 2 strips for D<sup>o.</sup>\"   Plates 132-134 are entitled \" French Handles \", and are in Louis Seize style ; Plate 135 consists of \" Escutcheons to Match French Handles.\"   The French Furniture in the victoria and Albert Museum contains examples very closely approximating to these patterns-a fact which raises the interesting question as to whether the furniture fittings of the late Louis Seize style were not, at all events in part, cast or stamped in England in the rough and exported to France, where they received that fine finish which has always been characteristic of French work of the kind.   <i>See illustration, plate III</i>.\"",
