Both top and bottom edge are rounded. At the right hand side the plank narrows on the lower edge as well as the upper edge and the carving peters out. On the left hand end the lower edge is shorter than the top with a deep v-shaped notch cut in the middle of the end. The back of the board is unstained and is rudely carved in graffiti fashion A1812 and with the letter H.\nA horizontal split across the centre of the board has been reinforced with glue and canvas. Three mirror plates, two top and one bottom, have been attached for display.\nAll the edges of the panel show wear and handling. One hole pierced through the top left corner with fragment of peg and one through middle of right hand side with fragment of peg.",

In Iceland, beds were built into the structure of the house, as in many rural communities throughout Europe.  Bedboards were loose planks that could be placed across the entrance to the bed to keep bedclothes in place.  For this reason, they only needed to be decorated on one face.  They were often carved by members of the family, or as a present from a young man to his future wife. During the day, they were hung flat on the wall, to form part of the decoration of the house.  In Iceland, the traditional carved motifs of scrolling plants and interlaced patterns continued in use until after 1850.  At that time they were given a new lease of life by the Arts and Crafts movement, led by the enthusiasm of the British designer William Morris for such traditional Icelandic folk-art. This bedboard is carved on the back with the date 1812, not as part of the decoration, but in the manner of graffiti.",
