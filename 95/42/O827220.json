PALMER \n\nGenerally, this exhibition shows very clearly how, in Palmer\u2019s work, most careful analysis went hand in hand with most imaginative designing. If, in etching, he had tapped the great resources of his analytical knowledge and draughtsmanship, now and then (as for instance the magnificent and very ancient tree trunks of Lullingstone Park), I am inclined to think that he might have done etched work as much to Ruskin\u2019s satisfaction as the tree-drawing which Ruskin eulogises in <i>Modern Painters</i>. \nWith the public verdict of seventy-four years (although I have not seen a tenth part of it), I feel content, and more than content. It has been kindly to a very high degree, even when written by those whose sympathies were almost entirely with etching of a totally different school. It has been, so far as I know, unanimous both in the press and privately. Maybe, that some day Mr. Rossetti\u2019s prophecy will be fulfilled \u2013 namely, that the realistic side of Palmer\u2019s art \u201con which he touches the many,\u201d will cause his work to grow in influence. \nOne of the objects of this exhibition was to demonstrate that the purely realistic and analytical side of that art was, from the very first, closely allied with the purely imaginative \u2013 that he continually turned from one to the other \u2013 thus vindicating Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s words: \u201cIt will be found that the ingenious are always fanciful and the truly imaginative never otherwise than analytic.\u201d \nIn all Palmer\u2019s art-teaching, or in the examples he made for his pupils\u2019 use, there was not one attempt to inoculate them with those artistic ideals by which, if his name goes down to posterity, he will be known. But there was a ceaseless effort to emphasize the importance of that universally unpopular pair, \u201cElements and Accuracy.\u201d \nAlthough my father once wrote that the destruction of an etched plate seemed to him like \u201cthe murder of a mind,\u201d I have followed the best advice in Europe most generously given at the cost of much time and trouble, and all the plates in my possession have been finally cancelled by one of the usual methods. This is a fate far more merciful than that they should have been ultimately sold and condemned to the lingering death and dishonour which has befallen plates by illustrious hands. \nThree eminent artists and etchers have, out of regard for Samuel Palmer\u2019s work and memory, done that memory the honour to attend to the plates\u2019 obsequies. They have done this even to printing some of the final impressions with their own hands. In the whole of my father\u2019s life there was no such incident as this. The devotion of the \u201cAncients\u201d to each other was as nothing to it. For brevity\u2019s sake I gave to the three artists the name of \u201cThe Trio.\u201d When any future collector sees the little equilateral triangle which symbolizes the three etchers (and also their initials F. S., F. L. G. and M.H.,) on the margin of an etching by their fellow craftsman, he will know that of all the kindly things which have been written and done in connection with Samuel Palmer and his work, none approaches theirs.\n\n[\u2026] \n\nADDITIONAL NOTES. \n\n<i>General Note on the Etchings</i>. \u2013 Although some of the best impressions of his etchings were sold or given away by Samuel Palmer, nearly all those which I have contributed to this Exhibition were, for various reasons, among his especial treasures. They also represent many days of intense agony and \u201cgrated consciousness\u201d by the side of the inanimate and animate machines which he had to deal with. Of the various states I myself know little. For that knowledge \u201cThe Trio\u201d must be consulted. \u2013 A.H.P.'\n<u>Catalogue of an Exhibition of Drawings, Etchings & Woodcuts by Samuel Palmer and other Disciples of William Blake October 20 - December 31, 1926</u>.

Publication No. 178 E.I.D. pp.82-83.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows: \n\n'THE BELLMAN \n\nCatalogue, nos. 211-216 \n\nOn the 4th August 1879 my father wrote to Hamerton as follows:- \n\u201cPricked already with etching like a full pincushion, your last letter burst my sides as with a packing-needle! How can I possibly touch copper again for eight months to come, with drawings in hand which ought to have been sent home years ago? Etching, that wheedling hussy . . . has already made me rob my long-suffering employers of time which really belonged to them . . . Some have fancied themselves to be tea-pots; others fragile glass. What am <i>I</i> but a broken etching-needle with its wrong end wedged into a paint-pot? It is <i>my</i> misfortune to work slowly, not from any wish to niggle, but because I cannot otherwise get certain shimmerings of light, and mysteries of shadow. . . . \n\n\u201cI am very glad that you like my <i>Bellman</i>. . . . It is a breaking out of village-fever long after contact \u2013 a dream of that genuine village where I mused away some of my best years, designing what nobody would care for, and contracting among good books, a fastidious and unpopular taste. I had no room in my <i>Bellman</i> for that translucent current, rich with trout, a river not unknown to song. . . . But there were all the village appurtenances \u2013 the wise-woman behind the age, still resorted to; the shoemaker always before it, such virtue is in the smell of leather; the rumbling mill, and haunted mansion in a shadowy paddock, where sceptics had seen more than they could account for; the vicarage with its learned traditions; and Wordsworth brought to memory every three hours by \n\u2018- the crazy old church clock \nAnd the bewilder\u2019d chimes. . . .\u2019\u201d \n\nOnce again he wrote to the same correspondent on October 13, 1879: \n\u201cIt does sadden me not to have touched a needle since Mr. Bellman\u2019s suit was stitched together, nor to have any chance of doing so for some time to come . . . but if I once get free and have my present reasons for thankfulness as to health, then welcome once more dear teazing, tickling coppers; may we never part again till the great change come when \u00c6sthetics and the Intellectual will be of little moment, and the MORAL all in all.\u201d \n\n<i>The Bellman</i> plate received thirteen bitings, and the usual thorough stopping out between them. The temperature of the mordant varied from 61\u00ba to 85\u00ba. After the first biting, the needle work was nearly doubled, and more was added after the second, third and seventh. The plate was proved by me at our press and was finished without catastrophe. The publishers were to be supplied, as far as possible, with impressions of my own printing. Once, in an emergency, I had to break the rule, with the result that some, printed elsewhere, were returned as being too bad to sell. Thus little by little, the functions of the press and my own work were enlarged far beyond the original scheme, and even that had seemed a daring scheme.'",
