They belonged to Jenny Lind who wore them in <i>La Sonnambula</i>, and when she came to tea with Elizabeth's parents when the little girl was not allowed to be present. Cross at being excluded, the little girl hid under the table, and when she was found, was told off and was very upset. Jenny Lind felt so sorry for her that she took off the bracelet and the matching necklace and gave them to her. They were passed from mother to daughter until Lee Persson gave them to the museum in April 1897 when she came to the museum and saw the Jenny Lind disoplay in the galleries.",
