            "public_access_description": "Often cast in bronze or lead, but sometimes struck in silver or even gold as here, the portrait medal commemorated individuals and often associated events. Many specialist sculptors from the Renaissance onwards were attracted to this small-scale art form. Inspired by Roman coins, with portraits of rulers on the obverse and allegorical representations on the reverse, medals were used as gifts and mementoes and eagerly collected. The medal format proved ideal for this type of personal and intimate object and commemorative portrait medals were particularly high regarded in France during the first half of the 17th century.\n\nThis medal depicts Louis XIII (1601-1643), and commemorates his consecration as King of France in 1610. It was made by the French medallist Nicolas Briot (about 1579-1646), who was later active in England and Scotland. \n\nThe obverse of this medal shows the young Louis XIII, wearing a crown, an ermine robe, a sash decorated with fleurs de lys and the Order of the Holy Spirit. The reverse has a hand reaching down from clouds holding the holy ampulla above ground. The ampulla was a Roman glass vessel containing consecrated oil with which French Kings were anointed at their coronation, until it was destroyed by Revolutionaries in 1793.\n\nBriot worked in Paris from 1602 and produced several medals commemorating the coronation of Louis XIII. He left France for England having handed over his affairs to his brother in 1625, and in the following years produced a number of portrait and commemorative medals in England, including of Charles I of England and his wife Henrietta Maria.",
