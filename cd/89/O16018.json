It reflects the Bombay School of Art's interest in the frescoes in the rock-cut caves at Ajanta in the western ghats.The upper register of the body is decorated with a broad scroll of flowers band of curving motifs runs round the middle above a lower tier of panels of similar flowers separated by vertical bands of varying abstract motifs.  Further flowering stems are set within framed outlines round the neck and a chevron pattern ornaments the handles.",

The pottery flourished from the mid 1870s until about 1890, but limped on after Terry's retirement at that time into the early years of the 20th century. Early wares were influenced by those manufactured in Sind as Terry set up his workshop with a Sindhi craftsman called Nur Muhammad. Soon, however, much of the decoration came to be influenced by the cave paintings at Ajanta, and were copied by the Schools students over a period lasting from 1872-1885. The ceramic students also adapted Ajanta motifs, as here, in an attempt by the School to encourage traditions of Indian art rather than European ones. Liberty imported some of the Wonderland wares to sell in its Regent Street shop in London",

The pottery flourished from the mid 1870s until about 1890, but limped on after Terry's retirement at that time into the  the early years of the 20th century. Early wares were influenced by those manufactured in Sind as Terry set up his workshop with a Sindhi craftsman called Nur Muhammad. Soon, however, much of the decoration came to be influenced by the cave paintings at Ajanta, which  had been discovered earlier in the century, and were copied by the School's students over a period lasting from 1872-1885, elements of which were adapted and used to decorate the ceramics in an attempt to encourage traditions of Indian art rather than European ones. Liberty imported some wares to sell in its Regent Street shop in London; see Stronge, Susan,'Wonderland', <u>Ceramics: The International Journal of Ceramics and Glass</u>, London, issue V, August 1987, pp. 48-53.",
