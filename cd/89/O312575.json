The base however displays typical techniques of K\u00f6nigsberg in the late 16th to early 17th century.\nThis object along with A.15-1950 forms a pair and is the only known example of a boxwood figure-group combined with an amber base. The applied panels might have formed part of an early gamesboard.",

A.\n\nHistorical significance: The obscure subject matter of this piece, which is in part reminiscent of a 'Sacrifice of Isaac' group, the incongruity of the costume, which is a combination of Mannerist-style classical armour, 17th century buskins, and drapery of an indeterminate period worn by the kneeling boy, the overall weak carving of drapery and anatomy, and certain telling details, such as the pose and face of the kneeling boy, suggest that this group[ is a 19th century pastiche, inspired by Netherlandish sculpture of the early 17th century. The base however displays typical techniques of K\u00f6nigsberg in the late 16th to early 17th century.\nThis object along with A.15-1950 is the only known example of a boxwood figure-group combined with an amber base. The applied panels might have formed part of an early gamesboard.",
