Pairs of these dishes may have been set out on the table during the dessert course, or on sideboards. The pierced-work and gilt scrolls are in a revival of the mid-18th century Rococo style, which was often used together with this type of naturalistic decoration.\n\nPlace\nThe dish was made at Coalport in Shropshire. The factory was sited on a canal leading off the River Severn. This location made it economical for the factory to ship in heavy raw materials, and to despatch finished goods to London and elsewhere. The area was rich in coal deposits, which provided the ceramic factories with fuel. This part of Shropshire had a long tradition in potting, so skilled workmen would have been available. There would also already have been a network of merchants and subsidiary traders in place when the factory was first set up.\n\nTrading\nAlthough some of Coalport's wares were made for a local market, many of the more elaborate wares were sold to major London retailers.",
