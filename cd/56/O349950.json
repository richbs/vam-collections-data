A lengthy and touching inscription on the back of the bust specifies that the sitter was aged 76 and 'his friend' Pigalle was 71 at the time this portrait was carried out.\n\nPerronet was a high profile figure, presented with several honours for his work, which was principally to be in charge of bridges and major roads in Paris. He was appointed Engineer to the King in 1763 and was a member of the academies of architecture and the sciences. Here he appears distinguished but also pensive. \n\nPigalle was not a prolific portraitist but here has executed a striking portrait for which the terracotta study was sold in Paris in 1990 (Hotel Drouot, June 27, lot 127). He excelled in conveying contrasting textures in bronze, and this is seen here in the lace, fur and wig, and even the buttonhole.",
