Stickers like these are a part of the street art phenomenon, usually stuck on walls alongside stencil work and tag graffiti, in urban areas. The simplicity and cheapness of the medium makes it attractive for young artists, and stickers can be seen not only at graffiti sites, but on public transport and advertising posters. \n\nBanksy is perhaps the best-known graffiti artist working in Britain today, and his influence extends far beyond the urban environment. His stencils, often political, and underlined with humour, adorn walls from London to Barcelona. His most memorable stunts, or interventions, include hanging one of his own paintings at Tate Britain (which went undetected for hours) and mounting a stuffed rat at London\u2019s Natural History Museum. Although most of his work pokes fun at royalty or religion, perhaps his most interesting work has been in the anti-war vein.",
