It is part of a collection made by Arthur Astill, who kept posters, handbills and advertisements from theatres where he appeared in variety. \n\nArthur Astill (1887-1962) started his career in a Pierrot Troupe known as the Olympic Serenaders. Subsequently he appeared on his own as 'the Whistling Ploughboy', which was his billing at the Palace Theatre, Blackpool, in June 1912. He went on to form a double act with Gwen Fontaine (1891-1978) whom he married in 1911. Their names are at the bottom of this bill, but in large type. One of their later acts, entitled 'Impressions of Country Life', included mimicry of birds, animals and children and was billed as 'Mirth, Mimicry and Ventriloquism'.",
