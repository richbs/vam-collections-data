Only rich women could afford a large gold cross, but almost every woman in Normandy owned a silver cloak clasp.  They are the most characteristic item of traditional Normandy jewellery.  They are usually stamped from a thin sheet of silver, with a pierced pattern imitating cut steel.  They have a broad hook at the front, which is often engraved with flowers.  They were used to fasten women's cloaks or capes, and are always made of silver.\n\nThese clasps are a delight for silver collectors, as they invariably carry a full set of French silver and maker's marks.  Similar clasps were worn in Poitou, and in Zeeland in the Netherlands.  This one was bought at Flushing, in the southern Netherlands, in 1876, but its marks show that it was made by Jacques Lely, a Parisian silversmith who specialised in making this kind of clasp.  Although these clasps are characteristic of Normandy, many were made in Paris, like this one.",
