Roller-printing on textiles had been introduced in the late 18th century, and at first was used mainly for small-patterned dress fabrics. By the 1830s it had become a highly mechanised process, and had largely replaced block-printing in the production of fashionable furnishings.\n\nPlaces\nBannister Hall, near Preston, Lancashire, was the leading printworks for woodblock furniture chintzes and set the fashion for other factories. Printing was carried out for London and Manchester merchants, who commissioned designs from skilled artists and sent them to be printed. Between 1825 and 1856 the firm was known as Charles Swainson & Company.\n\nDesign & Designing\nMany of the engravers of metal rollers were skilled draughtsmen. Joseph Lockett, one of the finest engravers working in the English industry in the first half of the 19th century, was largely responsible for the fashion in the 1830s for 'fancy machine-grounds', seen here, in which the whole background was covered with minute elaborately engraved patterns.",
