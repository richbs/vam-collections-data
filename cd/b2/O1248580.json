Players take it in turns to spin the top on the circular board using their choice of coloured balls. The scoring system is simple. Balls that land in holes of the same colour score double. Balls landing in different coloured holes score the points indicated. The game is fun and educational as children learn both addition and multiplication. The idea for the name of this game was probably prompted by the Spinning Jenny, a device invented in 1764 by James Hargreaves.",
