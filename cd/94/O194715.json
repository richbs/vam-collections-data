In the catalogue to this publication Gates writes: \"The series 'In Our Path', of which this photograph is a part, is about an area of Los Angeles that was supposed to become a freeway. Due to a court injunction filed by homeowners, the Sierra Club and the NAACP, construction was delayed for nearly a decade. The effect of this action resulted in an abandoned and desolate strip of suburbia dividing neighbors and communities. This series was not conceived as a documentary. Rather, I first thought of the proposed Century Freeway as \"fertile ground\" for some very surreal urban landscapes: a single tract house on an otherwise empty block. Only foundation remnants indicated this once had been a neighbourhood. The work began as a very private response to the environment and the idea of \"home\". Yet, when it was completed and I began speaking with homeowners and government officials involved in the freeway project the meaning of these photographs changed. They no longer reflected my internal issues but those of the families living there. After many conversations it seemed clear that despite extensive studies people were being affected by this project in subtle ways even the experts weren't aware of. What began as a group of surreal landscapes became very real. This image is a good example of how the freeway will divide neighbourhoods. Houses left standing in the path have been bought by Cal Trans (the State Department of Transportation). They are either empty and were not removed before the injunction stopped construction or re-rented (although the city of Downey has refused to allow Cal Trans to re-rent for fear that those coming into the community for a temporary period of time will not be as \"committed\" to the upkeep of their residences).\" For details of works by other artists from this publication, see Brooks, Ellen.",
