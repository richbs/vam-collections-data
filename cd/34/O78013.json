The Victorian obsession with correctness in dining presentation led to a desire for appropriate flatware  for serving and eating particular foods. Pie knives, pie spoons and other serving implements thus became available alongside specific types of dessert cutlery. These would often follow the popular flatware patterns of the time and could be purchased in boxed sets.  This knife, and the matching spoon also shown here,  were originally supplied together in a presentation box. \n\nFood & Drink\nMeat pies and fruit pies or tarts were both popular in the Victorian period.  The pastry used for fruit pies was lighter than that for meat pies, and popular fruit fillings included  apples, gooseberries, rhubarb, strawberries, raspberries and other soft fruits. As well as being eaten for dessert, fruit  tarts could be served at various times throughout the day.\n\nManufacturer\nThe makers of this knife and spoon set were George Shadford Lee and Henry Wigfull of Sheffield, who began trading as Lee and Wigfull.  It is not known when they first registered their mark, but the partnership was dissolved in 1879.  Wigfull subsequently continued trading under the same company name.  The firm converted to a limited company under the name Lee & Wigfull Ltd In 1899 and continued under that name until it was dissolved in 1941.",
