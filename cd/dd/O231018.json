Consequently, the fabrics will be described rather than the shape of the garment.\n The main fabric has a 'gold' ground [silver-gilt strip open S-wound on a yellow silk core]. There are black lines creating bands of large circles over which is laid a vertical pattern of lobed diamonds [white outlined in black], small mauve and red flowers join the sides of touching circles and a more star-like flower in the same colour links the not-quite touching circles top and bottom.  Each of these flowers is the centre of its own floral arrangement - building up a complex composition.\nSmall pieces added to the sides are from a different fabric, more poorly woven. It has a metal thread ground [silver strip open S-wound on a yellow silk core]. Incomplete pattern but white arabesques, outlined in black, form lobed compartments with a horizontal figure of 8 and a tri-lobed sections above and below. Each of the four compartments so formed, contains a red flower or red and mauve floral arrangement.",
