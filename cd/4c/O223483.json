A version of it was included in Cybernetic Serendipity, a major exhibition held at London's Institute of Contemporary Arts in 1968.  The book published to coincide with the exhibition includes the following information: \n\n\"Return to square (a)\nA computer metamorphosis. A square is transformed into a profile of a woman and then back into a square.\nIdea by Masao Komura, programme by Kunio Yamanaka (CTG) (p.75)\n\nThe text goes on to describe a related image, Return to square (b),also included in the exhibition. Early references to the Computer Technique Group include the English language spelling Komura, but the artist himself prefers the spelling Kohmura. \n\nThis version of the artwork has the caption Return to a square (a) below each of the four images, and was donated to the Museum by the Computer Arts Society. \n\nThe V&amp;A also holds a lithograph of Return to square (a) (CIRC.771-1969), one of seven prints published by Motif Editions in connection with the  Cybernetic Serendipity exhibition.",
