            "public_access_description": "Elsa Schiaparelli  (1890-1973) was famed for her attractive and wittily designed evening ensembles. Her clothes were smart, sophisticated and often wildly eccentric, and she had a huge following. Her ideas, coupled with those she commissioned from famous artists, were carried out with considerable skill.  She had close connections to the art world, and to the Cubist and Surrealist movements in particular.  Salvador Dal\u00ed and Christian B\u00e9rard are among the artists who collaborated with her.  This connection with the wider art world and its ideas set Schiaparelli apart from most other fashion designers.\n\nThis superb evening coat is one of the best examples of her close artistic collaboration with the French artist, poet and film maker Jean Cocteau (1889-1963).  Cocteau produced two drawings for Schiaparelli which were translated into designs for a jacket and this evening coat for the Autumn 1937 collection. \n\nThe design for the evening coat reveals Cocteau's preoccupation with the double image, a motif he consistently returned to in his work.  The double image held particular fascination for several other artists associated with the Surrealist movement, including Dal\u00ed.  The strong linear design on this coat can be read as two profiles facing each other, and in the negative space, a vase of roses standing on a fluted column.",

The Art and Fashion of Elsa Schiaparelli </em> (Philadelphia: The Philadelphia Museum of Art, 2003), p.140.\nOf the Philadelphia Museum of Art's own: \nSchiaparelli's close friendship with Jean Cocteau led to his making two drawings for her, which she used in her fall 1937 collection.  Cocteau's extraordinary ability to create from by the use of a single line is evident in these designs, translated into embroidery by the firm of Lesage.   The mirror image on the back of the blue silk jersey evening coat at left (now faded to lavender) is a classic example of Dali's paranoiac-critical method, in which more than one possible meaning can be attached to the same image.  Here, two faces in profile can also be viewed as a rose-filled urn set atop a fluted column\u2026\nSchiaparelli's collaborations with Cocteau included supplying costumes for the actress Jany Holt for Cocteau's play <em>Les Monstres sacr\u00e9s</em>  (The Holy Terrors) in 1940 (p.119) and for actress Maria Cesar\u00e8s in Robert Bresson's filk <em>Les Dames du Boise de Boulogne</em>  (The Ladies of the Park), with dialogue by Bresson and Cocteau, in 1945.\nHarper's Bazaar, USA edition, September 1937\nJean Cocteau drawing of a Schiaparelli dress.  Text (within the illustration) reads, in French:  \"Schiaparelli made this dress for dance and I copied it for Harper's Bazaar.  Jean\".  Text (bottom left) reads \"Schiaparelli might have cut this tapering sheath for Madame Tallien.  A slit for her wrist, a brilliant new color... cyclamen\".\nPoster for <em>Les enfants terribles </em> 1950 by Cocteau; offset lithograph, 165 x 122cm.\nThis poster shows the double profile motif used for the back of the evening coat.\nPainting by Cocteau, <em>The Etruscan Vase </em> ; oil on canvas, 73 x 60cm, 1952.

            "history_note": "This superb evening coat, designed by Elsa Schiaparelli, is one of the best examples of her close artistic collaboration with the French artist, poet and film maker Jean Cocteau.\nCocteau produced two drawings for Schiaparelli which were translated into a design for an evening coat and a jacket for the Autumn 1937 collection.  In September that year he also illustrated one of Schiaparelli's dresses for American Harper's Bazaar, writing \"Schiaparelli made this dress for dance and I copied it for Harper's Bazaar.  Jean\".\n\nThe design for the evening coat reveals Cocteau's preoccupation with the double image, a motif he consistently returned to in his work.  The double image held particular fascination for several other artists associated with the Surrealist movement, including Salvador Dali.  The strong linear design on this coat can be read as two profiles facing each other, and in the negative space, a vase of roses standing on a fluted column.  The use of bold lines to define the composition is typical of Cocteau's style and was beautifully translated into embroidery by the Paris firm of Lesage.\n\nDilys Blum, curator of Fashion and Textiles at the Philadelphia Museum of Art and author of  <font -i>Shocking! The Art and Fashion of Elsa Schiaparelli </font> has suggested that the double profile design on the reverse of the coat may represent Tristan and Isolde.  Salvador Dali used a similar double image for his Tristan and Isolde brooch of 1953.\n\nAnother example of this evening coat is in the collections of the Philadelphia Museum of Art (part of the Schiaparelli bequest).  However the example in Philadelphia has faded to a mid-lavender and the design differs slightly.  In the V&A's example, the appliqu\u00e9 roses are more profuse, covering the shoulders; the collar is lower and the column motif has four flutes rather than the five found on the Philadelphia example.  The shape of the back panel may also differ.\n\nTwo examples of the Jacket are known.  One in the collections of the Philadelphia Museum of Art and one in the Historical Society of Chicago.\n\nProvenance:\nThe coat was bought or especially ordered from Schiaparelli London by the Viscountess Doris Castlerosse (1901-1942, nee De Lavigne, first wife of Valentine Browne, Lord Castlerosse, later 6th Earl of Kenmare).\n\nThe Viscountess was a leading socialite of the 1930s.  She was a close friend of Cecil Beaton and posed for several photographic portraits.  Married to the Viscount Castleroose, the couple bought and lived in the Palazzo Venier in Venice.  Late in 1948, Peggy Guggenheim purchased the Palazzo from the heirs of the Viscountess.\n\nThe coat has remained with the family and has been worn up until the present day.",
