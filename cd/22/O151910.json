Bhanavar was the beautiful, innocent daughter of a Caucasian amir, who, having gained possession of the magic jewel (seen here adorning her forehead), became an evil Queen of the Serpents. The original monochrome version was commissioned from Sandys in 1864 by the publishers Chapman and Hall as the frontispiece for their second edition of the tales (1865). This watercolour, the second version, was painted by Sandys at Meredith's request, for him to present to a friend. It was reproduced in The Artist, Winter Number, 1896, and was also exhibited at the Royal Academy's Winter Exhibition in 1905. Book illustration formed a major part of Sandys's output. He contributed to several contemporary magazines, as well as to picture books and to editions of poetry, ballads, myths and legends. Originating in Norwich, he worked in London from 1851, where he was influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites, particularly Dante Gabriel Rossetti and his images of luxuriant female figures.",
