It was later converted into a public house.  \nPart of the fa\u00e7ade was given to the Museum by the Great Eastern Railway Company in 1890, when this house, along with other buildings, was demolished to make way for the enlargement of Liverpool Street Station.\n\nSir Paul Pindar was born in 1566 at Wellingborough, Northamptonshire.  Although educated with a view to a university career, he soon decided to enter the trading profession.  He was therefore apprenticed to an Italian merchant in London, Mr. John Powish, who sent him after a while to Venice.  Over the next fifteen years or so, he amassed a fortune in Italy and southern Europe before returning to England.

            "physical_description": "Portion of timber-framed house front consisting of a first floor projecting over street level and a jettied second floor which projects over the first floor, both of 9 units arranged in a central, semi-circular projection.\n\nThe second floor with 9 large panels below a large windows with 18 lights arranged in two rows; the whole floor set on an entablature with dentil moulding which extends around the modern return walls, and with a similar, modern entablature above, fitted roughly with modern softwood floorboards on modern joists. On the fa\u00e7ade 2 terminal posts with carved fronts forming pilasters, the right hand one a plaster copy of the left hand,  each with a monstrous, naked, female corbel figure above a female term, vertebrate ribbon ornament with mask on a rusticated base. The rectangular casement-type windows with oak frames (some hinged), lead cames and clear  glass quarries (all V&A c.1890). The central window with 3 lights on a curved wooden sill forming a semi-circular bay on a radius of 83cm (32 5/8\"). The large oak panels with low relief strapwork cartouches carved in the solid, the outermost panels with central masks, the centre panel with a stylised thistle (possibly an allusion to the Stuart monarchy).  \n\nInternally, there is no early woodwork except for two mullion facings of  oak  (approx ? cm thick) bearing low relief strapwork ornament and marked II flanked by flower heads. The floor boards running side to side are V&A c.1890.\n\nThe first floor with 9 large panels below a large window divided into 18 lights arranged in two rows; the whole floor set on an entablature with dentil moulding which extends around the modern return walls.  With 2 terminal posts with carved ornament forming pilasters, the right hand post (of softwood) replaced (V&A c.1890) and with an applied plaster copy of the left hand ornament, the ornament matching that on the second floor. The rectangular casement-type windows with oak frames (some hinged), lead cames and clear  glass quarries (all V&A c.1890). The central window with 6 lights on a curved wooden sill forming a semi-circular bay on a radius of 83cm (32 5/8\").  The large oak panels with low relief strapwork cartouches carved in the solid, the outermost panels with central masks (probably from workshop designs derived ultimately from such sources as Benedetto Battini, Vigilate quia nescitis diem neque horam (Antwerp, 1553) or Cornelis Floris, published in 1555), the centre panel  with the arms of the City of London. Internally the walls below dado height are fitted with oak panelling, (panel sight size tbc), with stop chamfer moulding to the rails and stiles. 8 boarded panels insde the projecting central bay are replacements, as are the internal sill running above and the stiles set between this panelling. The internal faces of 6 window mullions have been faced with oak panels  bearing low relief strapwork ornament (all apparently with different designs), and have been fixed with nails and some modern screws. It appears that original capitals and plinths to these pilasters have been removed.\n\nOn the right hand return at first floor level an eight-panelled oak door  (Museum no. 846:1-1890) on 2 metal H form hinges. Below the first floor bay is moulded plasterwork with grapes and vine-leaves. These may be visible for the first time in a view of the house by Shepherd (1858) illustrated in Goss (1930), but do not appear earlier. On the proper right first floor entablature is the metal firemark of the Hand-in-Hand Insurance Society, and on the proper left side another circular metal mark with a lion marked 'BRITISH'. Various metal rings and fittings driven into the oak timbers.\n\nNotes from examination of dismantled parts (recorded 2007)\n\nAfter 1939 fragment of dated newspaper and horsehair stuffed up behind the 2nd floor plaster console, which must have been added when the house-front was first reconstructed in the Museum\n\nMost of the joint pegs have been replaced, presumably during the 1890 removal, if not before. However both bay windows are essentially intact, including originally pegging and lath and plaster insulation behind the carved exterior panels.\n\nAssembly marks\nThere are traces of several sequences of assembly marks, scribed and chiselled, including a very prominent, clean set that seem to relate to Mowlem\u2019s dismantling in 1890; and others that mark the position of the large, external panels. Internally the marks tended to have been concealed by panelling, and externally many are difficult to interpret because of weathering. The practice of tagging Roman numerals provided an additional means to distinguish the marks on one floor or portion, from those on another. One sequence (apparently running IX - XVI) seems to relate to the mullions on each floor, and suggests that another, contemporary timber front of similar proportion and construction was contiguous to the south (the viewer\u2019s left). Another sequence seems to match the sills to mullions on each floor. \n\nTimber\nAll the original parts are oak. The exterior large panels are plain sawn, knotty English (probably SE) oak. Sapwood was found in one place (on the edge of panel...?)  Storey band looks a mix of faster and slow growth (probably English). From observation all the timbers appear to be English oak, except the panels used for the internal wainscot, which appears to be Balticm (straight, close-grained). These observations support the view of general building practice in the period, which normally records constructional timber cut relatively close to site, SE England in this instance.\n\nLeft hand post (halved conversion) has been inverted (a 13c discovery that allowed for greater strength at top where the mortises need to be cut.)\n\nTool marks\nA mix of riven, sawn and axed surfaces, with most show surfaces planed and moulded. The interior surfaces of the mortices show a spoon-drill bit, and scribing lines (which were usually made by the master for the workmen). Second floor left hand post show regularly spaced water saw-marks.\n\nThere is no evidence of a dragon beam support having been used under the windows, it seems to have been supported by joists.\n\nMain bressumer beam is jointed at its ends where it meets the main posts, but the joists rest on the beam, without jointing (although these were perhaps nailed down? AM). Yet dowels in first floor beams (under the panels) seem to contradict this? AM\n\nRunning repairs visible on the fabric\nTwo exterior facings on the first floor window (one above a tenterhook) have been added, and on both sides a narrow oak facing has been added to fill the gap between the facing and the profile of the window jamb. \n\nPlaster infill repairs where timber cracks open up (eg lhs storey post)\n\nMultiple nails on the second floor exterior might indicate a lath and plaster repair (as the nail heights are similar), and fragments remain under the nails.",

His house was built outside the City walls in Bishopsgate, a relatively spacious and fashionable street. Pindar purchased adjacent houses so that his property was actually much wider than is suggested by this surviving portion, probably the most ornate element. Like many London houses, it was much deeper than it was wide, with stables and a garden extending behind. The ground floor frontage was altered in suceeding centuries so only the upper two storeys were brought to the Museum. On the first floor at the front was a grand reception room with decorated plaster ceiling, oak panelling and a massive decorated chimneypiece and overmantel.

He also seems to have acquired three tenements to the south. Paul Pindar returned from Italy in 1599 and rebuilt the property, with the Bishopsgate facade facing approx SE. 'The street facade was of three and a half storeys, the north bay (or property) occupied by a large gateway. The middle bay was occupied by a first- and second-floor frame of ornate woodwork, forming a double-height continuous window on each floor, which is now preserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum (illustrated).The exterior form of the south bay is not known, but at ground level included a street door to the upper chambers. On the first floor at the front of the house, a single room had an ornate plaster ceiling (illustrated) and a fireplace with a plaster panel, dated 1600, showing Hercules and Atlas supporting a globe (illustrated). A second room had a similar ceiling with a central figure of St Christopher (illustrated) and other rooms in the house also had ornate ceilings. About 340 ft to the rear of the Bishopsgate frontage stood a three and a half storey building, 20ft x 40ft, called the garden lodge or banqueting house (illustrated). Its south face was enriched with four stucco panels representing Spring and Summer (above) and Peace and Plenty (below). Within were further plaster ceilings and a sixteenth-century fireplace.' Schofield p.111 notes that a portal or doorcase of wainscot on the inside of a door is shown in a 19th century view of the first floor chamber - being evidence that Pindar's house had up-to-date and stylish internal fittings.\n\nSchofield p.119 notes that two first floor chambers in Paul Pindar's house contained plaster ceilings. Plaster and papier-mache work was introduced into England by Italian craftsmen, and plaster ceilings of native manufacture date from after 1550. The first floor room overlooking the street was the position favoured for the hall or principal chamber in many London houses. It is likely that pattern-books were instrumental in providing the repertoire of designs for many of these English ceilings. A design (1584) by Abraham de Bruyn may be the source for one of the ceilings in Pindar's house.\n\nSchofield p.102\nPindar's house  incorporated extremely fashionable window-forms in the two-storeyed wooden facade, stretching as wide as the narrow elevation allowed. It has been suggested (Architectural Association post-graduate student, details in green catalogue) that Pindar's house front may be a notable early example of the appearance of curved windows in England - a considerable technical achievement in 1600.\n\nGoss (1930) provides the fullest account available of the building of Pindar's house, as well as a biographical sketch, though without references. He covers the following:\nrural situation of Bishopsgate without the city wall, p.1\n\nprevious owners of the land later occupied by Pindar's house, starting 13th century p.2-4\n\nprocess of building Pindar's house, adapting existing tenements and pulling down another on which site he erected the Bishopsgate front, and removing ground floor rooms of one of the existing houses to make room for a pedimented doorway and marble passage (which survived until the early 19th century), giving access to the great reception room and to the principal part of the mansion (in Half Moon Alley) at the rear; division of the house after Pindar's death, p.4-5\n\ndescription of the north-eastern front 'one immense bay window of extraordinary delicacy and beauty' [preserved as Museum no. 846-1890], and principal part of the house in Half Moon Alley, with archway to the stables, park and gardens, p.6-7\n\ndescription of emimence in London of Pindar's house, including estimate size, a \"frontage of about 90 feet, with a depth of 158 feet, including domestic offices, etc., with stables and riding covered way extending for a further 200 feet.\" [note that this represents the narrow ornate surviving frontage as well as the adjacent properties that he also occupied, but see Goss below p.14], p.7\n\nsojourn 1617-1618 of Venetian ambassador Piere [sic] Contarini in Pindar's house, described in Contarini's diary [in fact in the letters of his chaplain, Horatio Busino] as \"in an airy and fashionable quarter...It was a little too much in the country; but it was near the most fashionable theatres, especially those that keep the best trained dogs for bear and bull baiting.

Stone would have been the most expensive and prestigious building material, and much less quick to construct. A long tradition (from 12c) of framing techniques existed in England, with jetties common by 1300, though Schofield suggests that by 1600 new buildings of four and half storeys were being constructed without any jetties (pp.147-9), and it may be inferred that prominent jetties were somewhat old-fashioned by this date. \n\nSchofield provides an excellent summary of timber-framed building in London at this period (pp.140-150):\n\u2018Oak was the most widespread timber used in [London] buildings and other wooden constructions\u2026used for structural timbers, laths and boards\u2026By the thirteenth century it was as cheap to import oak and fir (deal)from the Baltic as it was to bring it from anywhere in Britain outside the Home Counties; this was presumably a symptom of the extraordinary demand in London as well as of difficulties with overland transport\u2026. In certain London building contracts the cross-sections of many of the principal timbers are specified\u2026 Most timber seems to have been hewn into rectangular cross-section before arrival\u2026 Standardisation of dimensions would aid prefabrication of buildings outside the city. Buildings were sometimes framed elsewhere, presumably near the source of the timber, and brought to London in a prefabricated state\u2026* During the second half of the sixteenth century close-studding seems to have been replaced, in high-quality constructions in London, by a new fashion of square or rectangular panels with applied [sic] Renaissance mouldings (including classical blind arcading) and, at intervals along the front, grotesque corbels growing out of elaborately carved vertical strips. This exuberant carving could be found in courtyards and was clearly en suite with contemporary styling of fireplaces and internal woodwork. It is usually attributed both to the influence of Renaissance-Mannerist pattern-books and to the influx of foreign-joiners and carvers, particularly from the Netherlands. The grotesque corbels were widespread on London buildings, including some of modest proportions\u2026\u2019 \n\n* Framed buildings were prefabricated in carpenter\u2019s yard where timbers were cut to size and joints shaped. The major timbers were assembled flat, checked for fit, adjusted, peg-holes drilled and the timbers marked (Quiney).",
