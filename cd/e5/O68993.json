It also included her husband, the baronet Sir Richard Atkins (died 1689), and their three children. Only rarely do 17th-century models for sculpture survive. The pose of this figure recalls medieval effigies; other English funerary monuments at this date often show the commemorated person reclining, rather than recumbent. This model may have been made as a presentation piece for the patron, who was almost certainly Lady Rebecca Atkins herself. Although the tomb was erected in the late 17th century, soon after her husband's decease, she did not die until 1711.\n\nMaterials & Making\nTerracotta (fired clay) was often used for sculptors' models, although it could also be employed for finished works. This was probably a preliminary model, and may even have formed part of the sculptor's contract.\n\nPeople\nWilliam Stanton (1639-1705) belonged to a family of sculptors.  He was the father of Edward Stanton (1681-1734) and Thomas Stanton (dates unknown), both of whom were apprenticed to him. They were admitted to the Masons' Company in 1702. William was also the nephew of another Thomas Stanton (1610-1674). All of these sculptor-masons specialised in erecting church monuments.",
