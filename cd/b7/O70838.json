The haloed and bearded Christ, wearing the torse and the loincloth and with the shroud draped over his shoulders, his right arm raised in blessing, holds in his left hand the cross-staff and banner of the Resurrection. He steps from the tomb onto the chest of a moustachioed soldier, who lies on a raised piece of ground in front of the tomb, holding in his right hand a battle-axe on the ground beside him. He wears a pointed basinet and tippet of mail, a low-belted jupon, gauntlets and armour. Another soldier, wearing a short, belted tunic is seated on the right of the tomb, holding the shaft of a spear (?) between his knees with his left hand, and turning to look up at Christ. A third soldier is represented asleep behind the tomb, leaning on it, his head resting on his hands, and a lance beside him. The basinet only of a fourth soldier is to be seen on the right of the panel behind Christ's left arm.\n\nThe top left corner of the panel is missing. The cross of Christ's staff and the top of the right-hand soldier's weapon are missing, and the face of Christ is badly worn. Green paint remains on the ground at the bottom of the panel. Much gilding still remains on the background of the panel with traces of gesso knobs. There are traces of gilding and red paint on the figures. The back of the panel has three holes filled with lead.",
