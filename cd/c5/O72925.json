The carving of the skin and musculatur of the torso are masterly, the rib cage shown shown pressing through the tightly drawn flesh of Christ's chest. The sculpture is carved in the round, although flattened at the back in the manner of an apliqu\u00e9 figure and was attached to a narrow cross by means of a large dowel that would have been inserted into the circular holebehind Christ's right hip. The drapery folds of the loincloth have been damaged and recarved, and microscopic traces of discoloured discoloured remain both here and in the beard. The latter were originally gilded, the lips of Christ were red, and the underside of  the loincloth was blue. The main surface of the of the loincloth has been stained brown, presumably by the painting medium used in the lost coloured decoration, and there is a ghost of a border running along the lower edge of the cloth.",
