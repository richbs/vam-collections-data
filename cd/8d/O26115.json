Players move along pathways that connect the different areas, and they follow printed directions, which include both forfeits and rewards. In the middle of each outer edge is a store comprising four oval spaces on which players place the food they have gathered. The playing pieces represent four woodland animals: a wood mouse, a red squirrel, a bank vole and a harvest mouse.",
