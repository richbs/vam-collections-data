Under the Marchese Lorenzo Ginori Lisci (d.1878), director from 1848, the pottery produced designs reflecting more varied and more contemporary tastes but also continued making its successful lustred wares.  This vase shows their skill in applied, modelled forms combined with the contemporary taste for naturalism. It was selected as displaying the 'most taste and originality...' In 1896 the pottery came under the ownership of Giulio Richard who already owned other factories.  Combined, the new company was known as the Societ\u00e0 Ceramica Richard-Ginori.",
