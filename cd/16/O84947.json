ISBN 1851771026\nThe following is the full catalogue entry:\n\n'10 John Keyse Sherwin (1751-1790) \n\nOil on canvas 26.7 x 22.3 cm. (oval) \n1782 \nProvenance: Rev. Alexander Dyce; Dyce bequest, 1869 \nCondition: Lined. Paint badly worn. Line following the curve of the oval edge along the bottom where the drawing lines of her arms, fold of material &amp;c. are not present and there in a grey underpaint, ground or filling only. Minor unfilled loss bottom centre and retouched areas on bottom end of neck and on left shoulder, arm and breast. \nTechnique: Grey ground on tabby weave linen. \n0.77 Neg: 59948 \n\nSarah Siddons as Euphrasia in 'The Grecian Daughter' by Arthur Murphy \nSarah Siddons played Euphrasia throughout the provinces during the 1770s. It appeared amongst the list of her roles in a letter sent by Henry Bate to David Garrick on 15 August 1775 when he was pushing her as a prospective leading lady for Garrick. After the subsequent disaster of the 1775-6 Drury Lane season Sarah Siddons developed Euphrasia and a few other unbearably tragic roles as the mainstays of her repertory. It was one of her most triumphant roles during her four years with John Palmer the Younger's company at the Theatre Royal, Bath. She opened there as Lady Townley in The Provoked Husband on 24 October 1778 and left Bath only to accept Sheridan's offer to return to Drury Lane where she opened on 10 October 1782 as Isabella in Isabella: or, The Fatal Marriage. She played Euphrasia for the first time in London on 30 October 1782 and the role, which she repeated eleven times during the season, was a huge success. Covent Garden tried to pre-empt Sarah Siddons's expected success by presenting The Grecian Daughter on 23 October with Mrs. Yates as Euphrasia and John Henderson as Evander but the ruse failed and the 1782-3 Drury Lane season was the most complete success of the great Siddons career. \nJohn Sherwin was one of the first artists to cash in on the new theatrical excitement. He engraved his own picture, dedicated it to the Gentlemen of the Bar and published it himself, with W. Hinton on 15 December 1782. This line and stipple engraving, 24.2 X 20.3 cm., is almost the same size as the original. A smaller stipple version, 8.3 X 6.7 cm., omitting the tiara was engraved by W. Holl and published by H.D. Symonds in 1800. '\n\nGeoffrey Ashton, 1992\n\n\n",
