Upper: as lower but 2.5cm plain weave.\nDesign: \nField: white ground with a large, irregular medallion indented along the sides. It has a dark blue ground covered with a small-scale Herati pattern with red diamonds and leaves in two shades of red. The medallion is outlined with blue hooks, one line of which has been omitted from a small section on both sides in the lower third. Also omitted (only on the left) is the inner line of indentations. The rest of the field has a white ground with off-set floral sprays in red and blue. The direction of the sprays is reversed mid-way down the field. These are surrounded by a small diaper pattern of orange diamonds with coloured centres. Small botehs appear occassionally, only three of which are inverted in the upper half.\nMain border: dark blue ground with an angular floral meander in yellow and red. This bears alternating stylised octagonal blossoms and palmettes - the latter branch out from the lower left hand corner. Blue weft is used across the lower width of the carpet and then is replaced with white weft used for the field, although the blue continues in the border. This was done for the first 5cm of the border and then the white weft was used throughout, perhaps because the change was time-consuming or perhaps because of the structural weakness. \nNo inner border.\nOuter border: dark red ground with a small floral meander with a significant colour change in the ground colour 20cm from the lower end.",

Both the design and the colouring were chosen to appeal to western taste.\n\n People\nIn 1873 this Museum authorised Robert Murdoch Smith (1835-1900) to collect Persian art on its behalf.  He was Director of the British-owned Persian Telegraph Department and succeeded in interesting the Shah in the South Kensington Museum.  As a consequence the Shah agreed to donate several carpets to expand the Museum's collection of contemporary craft. This carpet is one of those selected by the Shah's Ministers and Murdoch Smith. Murdoch Smith continued to act as the Museum's agent until he returned to his native Scotland in 1887; he later became Director of the Royal Scottish Museum in Edinburgh.\n\nMaterials & Making\nIn a pile fabric, such as this carpet, the foundation consists of two sets of threads, warp and weft, which interlace at right angles. The pile is created by tying a knot of coloured thread around two adjacent warp threads, building up the design row by row while the foundation is being woven by the insertion of weft. It requires only a simple loom and is easily done by hand.  In this carpet there are 3,584 knots per square decimetre.",
