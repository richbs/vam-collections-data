Noke for Doulton, represents the great actor Henry Irving as Cardinal Wolsey in Shakespeare's Henry VIII which he first played at the Lyceum Theatre on 5 January 1892.  Irving spared no expense on the lavish settings and costumes for this production, based on paintings by Holbein. Irving's on-stage partnership with Ellen Terry became one of the most famous in the history of the theatre. In the 1890s Royal Doulton at Burslem produced a pair of monochrome figures showing them in their respective roles, and then later re-issued them.\n\nRoyal Doulton began in Lambeth, London, in 1815 when John Doulton manufactured ceramic items such as stoneware bottles and sewer pipes. The Victorian revolution in hygiene and sanitation ensured its success, and Doulton's later produced tableware and commemorative items.  They moved to Burslem in The Potteries in 1882, added porcelain to their production two years later and were granted a Royal Warrant in 1901.",
