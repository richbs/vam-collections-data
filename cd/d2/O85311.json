Small boxes to contain the powder were made in their thousands, with decoration varying from the most expensive ones in jewelled gold and silver, to much more modest boxes of carved wood. This box is of a type that was produced in France by a semi-industrial process in the early 19th century. Boxes were turned out of burr maple or burr birch, and then steamed to soften them.  They were then put into screw presses where finely-worked metal dies stamped scenes or motifs into both the lids and the bases.  This box commemorates the bravery of the French Imperial Guard at the Battle of Waterloo, on 18 June 1815, when Napoleon's forces were finally defeated by the British, led by the Duke of Wellington.",
