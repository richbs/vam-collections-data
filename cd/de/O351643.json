At the beginning of the decade, dresses were full length and often rigidly corseted. During the war years, skirts became shorter and fuller, and the fit of bodices gradually became more relaxed.  Fabrics also became lighter. These changes are all reflected in Grace's wedding dress. Made from thin, crisp silk taffeta and feather-light silk net, the dress has a lightly fitted bodice. The mid-calf length skirt is semi-full, composed of billowing puffs of silk and multiple flounces of net. A fichu of gossamer-fine silk net lightly drapes the V neckline.\n\nDuring the First World War, soldiers away at war were encouraged to think about their sweethearts waiting for them at home. Delicate, romantic dresses like this emphasised the gentle, feminine qualities a wife was supposed to exemplify, offering newly-married soldiers a romantic image to take with them to the battlefields.",
