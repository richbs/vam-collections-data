While his earlier designs tended towards futuristic and angular tailoring, his work in the 1970s grew softer and lost its rigidity. His ready-to-wear line, Parall\u00e8le, used bright colours and bold prints which were often the fruits of his collaboration with textile designer Sonia Knapp. This dress comes from Ungaro\u2019s haute couture line which from the 1970s featured clothes with a formal, high-end appeal made from distinctive textiles. This dress of accordion pleated silk has a wrapped effect across the bodice, a common feature in Ungaro's work.",
