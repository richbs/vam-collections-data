French-style commodes with floral marquetry were made in London from 1759.\n\nPeople\nPierre Langlois (active 1759-1767) must have trained in  one of the best Paris marquetry  workshops, possibly that of Jean-Fran\u2021ois Oeben (1721-1763). Langlois shared his London premises in Tottenham Court Road with his son-in-law, the bronze-caster and gilder Dominique Jean, who made the mounts for his furniture. Langlois's London clients included John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford (1710-1771), George William, 6th Earl of Coventry (1722-1809), and Horace Walpole.  He sent furniture to Lady Louisa Connolly in Ireland at Castletown House, County Kildare, and to Elizabeth, Duchess of Northumberland, at Alnwick Castle, Northumberland.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe original marble top is an unusual feature in Langlois's London work, for the tops of his commodes are usually inlaid with marquetry. The shading of the inlay (achieved by scorching in hot sand) is particularly effective (for example, the corners of the eyes of Pan's mask on the side panels). The ormolu (gilt bronze) mounts are identical to those on documented commodes supplied by Langlois to the Duke of Bedford and the Earl of Coventry. The commode still has its original key with an ormolu handle.",
