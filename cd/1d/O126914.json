Modern Chairs:1918-1970. The Whitechapel Art Gallery, London:\nThe form of the upholstery, a visually tight shead of flattish sewn plastic, cushion elements, is perhaps the most interesting technical feature of the chair, and adapts itself exceptionally well to the flexibility of its hammock-type seat. Its particular formal interest, however, perhaps lies in its throne-like, slightly exaggerated scale. It was first shown at the Cologne Furniture Fair, 1970.",
