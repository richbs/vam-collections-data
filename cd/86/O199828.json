            "public_access_description": "In 1944 designer Oliver Messel was released from his war duties to work on the film Caesar and Cleopatra, adapted from George Bernard Shaw's play. Messel was responsible for the costumes and the interior of the sets, imaginatively interpreting Roman Egyptian dress and decor in the context of the mid 1940s. The film cost over \u00a31 million, and brought a welcome sense of extravagance and colour into a drab post-war world.  Surprisingly, given his sense of colour, Messel never worked on another colour film. \n\nVivien Leigh (1913-1967) played the role of Cleopatra. Messel designed a number of wigs for her, each in an instantly recognisable Egyptian style. This one is formed on a moulded 'cap' which is neatly covered by hair and has braids attached round the base. As the wig has to be seen in close-up, it must appear realistic, but Messel has used some tricks of the trade to make it attractive and comfortable. The hair on the cap is held in place at the lower edge by a thin band of black tape. This was not visible on camera as it was concealed beneath a tasselled circlet. The gold bead at the end of each braid is firmly attached to the hair and is weighted to make the braid hang straight. At the back of the head the braids are loosely held together by a concealed black tape which helps to maintain an attractive shape, and a pad at the base of the cap cushions the wearer's neck and pushes the braids outwards. \n\nOliver Messel (1904-1978) was Britain's leading theatre designer from the early 1930s to the mid 1950s, working in every aspect of entertainment - ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue - as well as in interior decoration and textile design.  His lavish, painterly and romantic designs informed by period styles, were perfectly in tune with his times and earned him an international reputation.  By 1960, however, Messel's style had become unfashionable, having no sympathy with the new 'kitchen sink' school of theatre.  He increasingly concentrated on non-theatrical painting and designing and eventually retired to the Caribbean, where he began a new career designing and building highly idiosyncratic luxury villas.",
