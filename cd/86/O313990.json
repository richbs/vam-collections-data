He trained as a goldsmith and developed considerable skills in engraving crystals and dies. For Pope Clement VII he created his masterpiece, a crystal casket with 24 scenes from the life of Christ, now in the Palazzo Pitti in Florence.\nBelli was strongly influenced by Raphael and Michelangelo.\nHe had a facility to work very quickly, and Vasari noted that Belli had flooded the world with his works.",
