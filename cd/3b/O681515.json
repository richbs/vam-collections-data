London: Published by Trustees of the Victoria and Albert Museum, 1987.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n\"George CRUIKSHANK (1792-1878)\nThe Modern HANNIBAL, alias the King of ROME, Swearing Eternal Enmity  to ENGLAND, 1814. Lettered with the title and <i>Pubd Jany 16th 1814 by T. Tegg/111, Cheapside, London,/G. Cruikshank fect</i> and numbered top right <i>288</i>.\nEtching coloured by hand.\nCut to 24.4 X 35cm.\n9459.D.\nGiven by Mrs Elizabeth Cruikshank, the artist's widow. \n\nThomas Tegg started as a bookseller, specialising in cheap reprints and popular abridgements, and then in 1807, he began applying the same principles of price cutting to the publication of caricatures.  In 1808 he advertised 'A large collection (the largest in England) of new popular Humourous and Political Caricatures by Woodward, Rowlandson, Cruikshank only 1s each, equal to many and superior to most published at double the price'.\nCruikshank's extraordinarily long career meant that he participated in two distinct phases of English caricature.  He began working somewhat in the same vein as Gillray (who had succumbed to insanity by 1814), attacking targets such as the arch-bogeyman Napoleon.  As the nineteenth century progressed, Cruikshank's style altered in line with popular taste and the work in demand by publishers towards comic illustration.  The colouring of this print is of a type commonly encountered on the products of Thomas Tegg in his first years of caricature publishing.  The use of saturated opaque colours and the exaggeration of skin tones are hallmarks of what amounts to an early Tegg house style.  This colouring style is much coarser than the delicately hued caricatures issued by established publishers such as Hannah Humphrey (who had sole rights on Gillray from 1791 onwards) and is a further example of the gap between the West End taste and the City products, the latter also being sold in the provinces.\"",
