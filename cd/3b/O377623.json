The flat band of plaited wire, and the ogival points on the sheet silver ends, can be found on bracelets and belts throughout the eastern Mediterranean area, in those regions which were once part of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nIt was bought for ten shillings at the International Exhibition, London, 1872.",
