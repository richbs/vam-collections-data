Small bottles for oil and perfume were used in great quantities throughout the Roman Empire. With the arrival of glassblowing around 50 BC, such items could be made relatively easily and became affordable to people of modest means. The two small loop handles on the neck of this bottle would have held a larger loop handle in bronze which could be used to suspend the bottle or carry it around.\n\nOils and other unguents were important in Roman society for preparing the bodies of burial or cremation. After use, the containers for such prepatory producs were often deposited alongside the bodies in their graves.",

Like many ancient peoples, the Romans believed in an Afterlife that would be an idealized form of their worldly experience. So it was a family obligation to ensure that the grave of every deceased relative was furnished according to its means; not just food and wine, but also offerings of perfume. The wealthy would provide these offerings in flasks (unguentaria) made of silver or alabaster. With the arrival of glassblowing, poorer folk now could offer similar items in glass.\n\nThere was also an extensive market for unguentaria in life as well as death; Roman society was fastidious about personal hygiene and appearance. And during the mid-1st century A.D., as glassworkers continued to adapt their skills, their wares steadily ousted their pottery counterparts from the marketplace.
