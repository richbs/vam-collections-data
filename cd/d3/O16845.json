One of the women plays a horn, another a drum, another a guitar-like instrument, and another finger cymbals, while one woman claps and two others idly lounge. There was a vogue for composite paintings of this kind in Delhi about 1820 to 1830.\n\n'Company paintings' were produced by Indian artists for Europeans living and working in the Indian subcontinent, especially British employees of the East India Company. They represent a fusion of traditional Indian artistic styles with conventions and technical features borrowed from western art. Some Company paintings were specially commissioned, while others were virtually mass-produced and could be purchased in bazaars.",
