Robert Fraser promoted British pop and conceptual artists and introduced contemporary American artists such as Claus Oldenberg, Jim Dine and Larry Rivers to a British audience, as well as exhibiting the work of more established artists such as Magritte and Dubuffet. Both the Beatles and the Rolling Stones were among the gallery's fashionable clientele. Michael Cooper joined the gallery in 1964 and worked for Fraser as the gallery photographer, recording events and producing publicity materials. Through Fraser he had access to many avant garde artists and writers, and got to know the members of the Rolling Stones, whom he photographed extensively during the 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nThis photograph was taken during John Lennon's 'You are here' exhibition at the Robert Fraser gallery in 1968.",

Robert Fraser promoted British pop and conceptual artists and introduced contemporary American artists such as Claus Oldenberg, Jim Dine and Larry Rivers to a British audience, as well as exhibiting the work of more established artists such as Magritte and Dubuffet. Both the Beatles and the Rolling Stones were among the gallery's fashionable clientele. Michael Cooper joined the gallery in 1964 and worked for Fraser as the gallery photographer, recording events and producing publicity materials. Through Fraser he had access to many avant garde artists and writers, and got to know the members of the Rolling Stones.",
