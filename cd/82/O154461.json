It is devised and executed from a single piece of silver, enforcing a strong and coherent unity in design. The handle seems to be extruded from the blade, twisting like a tail, or a rope of seaweed. The effective simplicity of the form is engagingly complicated by the surface treatment. The elaborately peened/chased surface evokes an indefinable range of organic resonances: the texture creates ripples of light, like sunshine on water. Strength of form and delicacy of decoration are in perfect balance.",
