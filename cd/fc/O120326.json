Although pieces of this type were produced in quantity, there is very little that can be firmly established about the workshops which made them.  Some idea of date of manufacture is provided by parallels with European furniture, particularly in the use of fine marquetry and inlaid decoration. A recurring motif is that of intersecting circles and stars, which appears on 16th and 17th century furniture made both in India and in Japan under Portuguese patronage.  Parallels with church furniture in Old Goa have led scholars to conclude that this table was made in the vicinity of this city.  \n\nIn his description of Goa, Dutch clergyman Hughyen van Linschoten explains that different craftsmen were concentrated on different streets:  \u2018There is also a street full of gold and Silver Smithes [that are] Heathens, which make all kinde of workes, also divers other handicrafts men, as Coppersmithes, Carpenters, and such like [occupations], which are all heathens, and every one a street by themselves.\u2019",
