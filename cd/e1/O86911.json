All the peasants wore similarly multicoloured and braided costumes.  They were designed by Stefanos Lazaridis for the 1973 Royal Opera production at Covent Garden, and he probably had in mind the bright colours and ribbons of traditional gypsy dress, which fitted within the overall production style of 16th century Spain and its over-elaborate, ornate art.  \nHowever, these historical suggestions were at odds with Lazaridis's very contemporary abstract set of shiny scaffolding.   This contrast of abstraction and realism went down ill with the audience and there was booing on the first night \u2013 though whether this was objection to the production or a generalised, organised protest against Royal Opera House policy has never been resolved.",
