One magazine article of the time observed that 'some have spoken of Mr Wells as the English Millet of Sculpture', a reference to the acclaimed painter of peasants in mid-19th-century France, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet, and to Millet's painting The Sower of 1850. \n\nWells (1877-1951) initially trained at the Camberwell School of Art, and during the late 1890s at the Royal College of Art under the supervision of Edouard Lanteri. He later studied ceramics at the Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts. Wells became particularly renowned for his small-scale bronzes, most of which were produced between 1900 and 1910. From about 1909 onwards he became increasingly interested in ceramics. A number of examples of his pottery are in the Museum's Ceramics and Glass Department. He established the Coldrum Pottery, Wrotham around 1900. At the outbreak of the First World War he closed the pottery and began designing and manufacturing aircraft. On the failure of his aviation business he established the London Pottery Company, Chelsea, relaunching the business with the optimistically named 'SOON' ware - 'soon' representing the anticipated timing of his success in the venture.",
