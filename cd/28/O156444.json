Ladies and gentlemen would offer each other snuff from rich, elegant boxes in the latest styles.\n\nThis box is decorated with miniatures of figures and cattle in country landscapes. They are in the style of the artist Nicolaes Berchem, presumably taken from engravings, but the identity of the artist is unknown. Gabriel-Raoul Morel, the goldsmith responsible for the box, was born in Paris in 1764. He first entered his mark in 1797, under the French Revolutionary government and is noted for the range of media in which he worked.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world\u2019s great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",

It has been argued that these marks were struck during the period 1793-97 (Nocq and Dreyfus 1930, XV), but there appears to be no evidence for this, and indeed it is easy to prove that this could not have been the case, because the boy's head mark is found on objects that could not have been made before 1804, including a gold snuffbox , formerly in the possession of Garrard's, London, that is struck with the mark of Victoire Boizot, Joseph-Etienne Blerzy's widow, who did not register a mark until April 6, 1806.",
