Early prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of William Etty, studied at Sass's art school, and entered RA Schools 1829 (won several prizes, including Gold Medal 1839). Won Gold Medal at Society of Arts 1833/4, and a prize in Westminster Hall fresco competition 1843. ARA 1846, RA 1870, honorary retired RA 1876. Exhibited 77 works at the RA between 1836 and 1878, 33 at the BI 1842-67, and two watercolours at the SBA in 1871 and 1875. Early works mainly portraits, then mythological and allegorical subjects usually involving female nudes sometimes in great numbers. Many of his works were engraved; there are eight in the V&A collections, and also several drawings. Redgrave (<i>Cent</i>) wrote that his female figures had 'none of the vigour of those by Etty, though they have a chaste and graceful character'. Died Fitzroy Square, London, 4 June 1877; his studio sale was at Christie's 14-16 March 1878.\n \nLIT: <i>The Times</i> 8 June 1877 (obit); <i>Athenaeum</i> 9 June 1877, p744 (obit); <i>Art Journal</i>1877, pp234, 280 (obit)\n\n<b>Contemplation</b> \n557-1882 Neg HF972 \nPanel, oval, 18.1 x 13.3 cm (7 1/8 x 5\u00bc ins) \nJones Bequest 1882 \n\nTwo oval pictures, small to judge from the prices, were in the artist's studio sale at Christie's 16 March 1878: 'Head of a Greek Girl', (349), bought Rousby \u00a32 2s, and 'A Study of a Girl's Head', (361), bought Lilley \u00a35 5s.\"",
