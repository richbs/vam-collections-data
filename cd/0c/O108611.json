It was made in 1842, at a time when knitting had become a hobby for most people and the knitting sheath had become obsolete. \n\nHowever, some workers in places like the Yorkshire Dales continued to earn their living through knitting. They still knitted using the sheath, as they found this method faster. 'Goose wing' sheaths like this one were specially adapted to fit the shape of the knitter's waist.\n\nThis one has an abstract design carved on one of its faces, with the initials 'AWG' and the date 'Nov 16 1842'.",
