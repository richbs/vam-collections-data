They were worn increasingly with civilian clothes as \u2018small swords\u2019, offering a means of self-defence but largely denoting status for the well-dressed gentleman.\n\nSmall swords were items of male jewellery. By the 1750s, their elaborate gold and silver hilts, mounted with precious stones and fine enamelling, were the products of the goldsmith and jeweller rather than the swordsmith. They made fitting rewards for distinguished military and naval service. With their blades tucked away inside scabbards, it was their ostentatious and expensive hilts that carried their thrust.\n\nDecorated with garlands, ribbons and triumphal military emblems this is a classic presentation small-sword of the mid-18th century.  The finger loops and the shell guard offers little protection for the hand. The hilt is finely pierced and was probably the work of a gold-box maker. The sword's strength is as a work of art rather than as a weapon.",

By the 1750s, their elaborate gold and silver hilts, mounted with precious stones and fine enamelling, were the products of the goldsmith and jeweller rather than the swordsmith. They made fitting rewards for distinguished military and naval service. With their blades tucked away inside scabbards, it was their ostentatious and expensive hilts that carried their thrust.",
