The areas to be left a lighter tone were then resisted using the <i>tsutsugaki</i> technique and the fabric was then dip dyed over 15 times to achieve the deep blue of the background. The calligraphy on the <i>noren</i> is based on that of Reverend Kosho Shimizu, the former abbot of the Todai-ji temple in Nara.",

The calligraphy reads 'momo kuri sannen kaki hachinen', which means 'one much have patience in all things'. It can also be read more literally as 'it takes three years for peaches and chestnuts, eight years for persimmons'. These fruits also feature in the design.",
