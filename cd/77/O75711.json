This sundial has thirteen facets with metal gnomons and sits on a baluster-shaped pedestal. On acquisition it was claimed that this type of sundial was very common in Scotland, and only found in England in the northern counties. A suggestion was made (not in the event taken up) that this dial be placed in the quadrangle of the Museum to be 'appreciated by those who have to design gardens in the old style'. In 1910, when this dial arrived at the V&A, designing gardens in the style that was current around 1700 (the approximate date of this dial) was the height of fashion.",
