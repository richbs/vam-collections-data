She hosted the state visit of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip at the Embassy in April 1957, and invited her great friend Diana Cooper to attend the dinner held at the British Embassy on Tuesday 9 April, at which this dress was probably worn. It was designed by Pierre Balmain (1914-82), and the bodice features the appliqu\u00e9 technique favoured by him.\n\nLady Gladwyn wrote in her diary: \"The supper was, I think, just right for the occasion: cold salmon, chaudfroid of chicken, a salad, oranges and lemons filled with sorbet, and a wonderful Bollinger... The difficulty was to get rid of all the guests.  They lingered on, and at half past one in the morning Cecil Beaton was still sketching Diana Cooper in the Ionian Room\".\n\nIn 1971 the society photographer Cecil Beaton collected several of the dresses worn during this particular state visit to donate the V&A.  These included the Queen's embroidered ivory gown by Norman Hartnell (1901-79), T.264-1974, Lady Gladwyn's lilac lace gown by Jacques Fath (1912-54), T.173-1974, and Baroness Alain de Rothschild's spotted tulle gown by Christian Dior (1905-57), T.121-1974.",
