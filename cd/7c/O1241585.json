This dinner card is part of a set of 15 produced by Beatrix for Melford Hall and was used by Ethel Hyde-Parker\u2019s daughter, Stephanie. Names of guests could be inserted into the diagonal slots.\n\nBeatrix Potter (1866-1943) is one of the world's best-loved children's authors and illustrators. She wrote the majority of the twenty-three original Peter Rabbit books between 1901 and 1913. The Tale of Peter Rabbit (Frederick Warne, 1902) is her most famous and best-loved tale.",
