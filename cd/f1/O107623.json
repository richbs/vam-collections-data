It is also similar to the stucco carving inside the Sultan Hasan mosque in Cairo, dated 1350.\n\nPANELS, four. Ivory, carved with arabesque designs in two reliefs. From Cairo. Saracenic.

However, plaques of an identical size and decoration to these are inlaid into the altar screen of al-Mu'allaqah ('The Hanging Church'), one of Cairo's most famous Coptic churches. Other Coptic churches in Cairo contain examples of wooden furniture with inlaid ivory plaques, decorated in a very similar floral style to these plaques, though they often include an equal-armed Coptic cross within the decoration.\n\nThe style of the designs on these plaques and the double relief of its carving is very close to the Hama basin (Museum no. 335-1903) which is dated 1277. It is also similar to the stucco carving inside the Sultan Hasan mosque in Cairo, dated 1350.",
