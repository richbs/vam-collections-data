The jambs are decorated with stems laden with flowers and foliage, intermingled with wings and tassels. The stems rise from vases at the base, and are crowned by eagles. The lintel is carved with festoons of laurel; at either end is a shield which bears the arms of Montefeltro (quarterly, one and four, an eagle displayed sable, beaked, membered and crowned or in chief; two and three, bendy or and azure). The shields are divided by a pale, charged with two crossed keys surmounted by a tiara, representing the banner of the Church in the form of a pale of augmentation. The tiara is surmounted by a coronet. In the centre of the lintel is an eagle. To the right of this are carved a clothes brush, an ermine, standing on a rocky base, with a label above inscribed 'NON MAI', a horse\u2019s bit, an unidentified object. To the left of the eagle are a medallion, inscribed 'FD' (i.e. Federicus Dux),  an exploding bomb, an ostrich, with a label above inscribed 'ICH AN VORDALTER' (i.e. Ich an vordait em grossers). Above the lintel is a frieze carved with palmettes and other ornaments. In the centre the Garter of England, inscribed 'HONI. SOIT. QUI . MAL . Y. PENSE' in Gothic letters, encloses a shield with charges similar to those of the shields on the lintel and surmounted by a coronet. On either side of the shield are the letters FD.

On the lintel are the arms of the Montefeltro, with the emblems of a clothes brush, an ermine, a horse's bit, and an unidentified object, and a medallion inscribed FD (for FEDERICVS DVX), an exploding bomb and an ostrich. In the centre above the lintel is the Garter of England. The Palazzo Ducale at Gubbio was built between c. 11474-6 and 1480, for Federigo da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino, who was appointed to the order of the Garter in August 1474.",
