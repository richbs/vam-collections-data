Triton is thought to be Matthias Steinl's earliest surviving sculpture. Triton is a mythological Greek god, the messenger of the sea. He is the son of Poseidon, god of the sea, and Amphitrite, goddess of the sea. He is usually represented as a merman, having the upper body of a human and the tail of a fish.\nThis statuette is without doubt from a larger ivory vessel, the other elements now missing. It is remarkably finely carved and probably served as a stem for a goblet, the vine-leaves alluding to vine. \nSteinl practised as an architect and designer as well as a sculptor. He probably trained in Austria and took over the workshop of the sculptor Matthias Knote in Leubus (now Lubina) in the mid-1670s.",
