The sections divide at the top of the triangular base, the top of the thickest section of the shaft (with winged cherubs heads) and under the wreath that forms the third ring from the top.  The shaft below the uppermost section is loosely dowelled into it.\n\nThe only element that is possibly pre nineteenth century is the one two from the bottom (the one with the cherubs heads on it).  The triangular base section could be old but the virgin is rather 'soppy' looking, suggesting a later date.  The newest elements are the top two.",
