The decorative band (50mm wide) consists of three figures in a row The first is a woman wrapped in a long robe and holding a staff in her right hand. The second figure is of a man wearing a short tunic. The third is another woman wrapped in a robe, she has a red and blue/green stripealong the parting of her hair. The figures are in purple with undyed thread forming the details. They sit within a single lined border on either side. The linen on which the figures were woven was very fine although most has been lost. The band is attached to a coarser linen cloth at 17x22 tpc  (sys 1 x sys 2). This thread width differs in some places. Two thick rows run alongside the left side of the band, created by weaving 4 or 5 linen threads together at that point. At the top right corner of the band are red threads which probably formed part of the neckline. The piece is stained. See 1024-1901 and 1026-1901",
