Above the flowers stand wires, each supporting a large pearl alternating with longer wires each supporting a silver backed rhinestone surrounded by a tuft of shredded cellophane. Fixed at the back of the head-dress is a large flat bow of gauze silver strip ribbon with long short wires each ending in a small circle of silver faceted beads around a central pearl; from below the remainder emerge the loops of a serptentine wire covered with gold metal mesh. From the sides hang long frings of individual strings threaded with oval silvered beads separated by horizontal silver scallop-edged flower sequins from lines of three faceted silvered beads; at the bottom of each string hangs a large vertical faceted silver sequin.",

            "public_access_description": "This charming headdress was designed by Oliver Messel for Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream at the Old Vic in 1937.  The director, Tyrone Guthrie, used the well-known Mendelssohn incidental music, which he felt was \u2018redolent of crimson and gold opera houses, of operatic fairies in white muslin flying through groves of emerald canvas.\u2019 Messel's designs perfectly echoed the concept.  \n\nMessel was always inventive in his use of materials and used makers, in this case Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Clement, who understood his requirements.  He knew that the theatre is heightened realism, so the flowers are a mixture not of fabrics but metallic paper, chandelier drops, metal discs and cellophane which subtly convey the fantasy, inhuman elements of the fairy queen and her steely character.  Titania was played in this production by Vivien Leigh who, crowned with 'stars' and with the gauze ribbons falling down her back, looked the epitome of an imperious Victorian fairy queen.  A. E. Wilson reported that she was \u2018like an exquisite picture from some Victorian lady\u2019s keepsake\u2019.  Messel, was a good friend of Leigh and kept this headdress as a prized possession, storing it in a box which he painted himself in characteristic style.  The box is now as desirable as the headdress is contains.  \n\nOliver Messel (1904-1978) was Britain\u2019s leading theatre designer from the early 1930s to the mid 1950s, working in every aspect of entertainment - ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue - as well as in interior decoration and textile design.  His lavish, painterly and romantic designs informed by period styles, were perfectly in tune with his times and earned him an international reputation.  By 1960, however, Messel\u2019s style had become unfashionable, having no sympathy with the new 'kitchen sink' school of theatre.  He increasingly concentrated on his non-theatrical painting and designing and eventually retired to the Caribbean, where he began a new career designing and building highly idiosyncratic luxury villas.",

The production was revived the following year with Dorothy Hyson taking over from Leigh.  In a a portrait photograph taken by Anthony, Leigh is wearing this headdress, though only a few of the jewels above her forehead can be seen. Production photographs show Leigh wearing the lighter headdress (S.507-2006) which Messel designed for the early, more active, scenes. This grander headdress was worn for the formal blessing scene at the end. \nMessel decorated box S.492:1/2-2006 to house the two headdresses.  \nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's theatre designs and other designs and artefacts.  The designs were briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being housed at the V&A from 1981 on indefinite loan.  The V&A Theatre Museum purchased the Oliver Messel collection from Lord Snowdon in 2005.",
