The yellowish glow suggests a relatively high zinc content. The candle stub of burnt down animal fat or beeswax would have been extracted and melted down to make new candles. It is possible that the base of the stem has been cut down.\n\nSocketed candlesticks made their appearance in the late 13th century and thereafter became relatively common, replacing the earlier pricket form, at least for domestic use. The earliest sockets were polygonal in cross-section. By the 15th century they were round. At first, two vertical apertures opposite each other were cut into the sides of each socket, in order to facilitate the extraction of the burnt-out stub. As the production of cheap tallow (pig's fat) candles became more sophisticated the size of these apertures became correspondingly smaller.",
