Men playing women was traditional in many cultures at a time when it was not considered seemly for women to appear on stage, but its survival in this form is peculiar to Britain, and now thoroughly confusing to the rest of the world.    \nPantomime dames are noted for their outrageous and often comical costumes, which usually reflect the qualities or situation of the character; the washing line attached to the wig refers to Widow Twanky's occupation as a laundress.  The reference is retained even though this costume is for the traditional spectacular finale.  \nThe costume was originally made for a pantomime in Stockport in 1983 and was conceived and made in one day by costumier Paddie Dickie when the costume originally provided for Dainty proved unsuitable.  It is a 3-gag costume - first the appearance with the exaggerated panniers and over-the-top fabrics, then the rotating clothes-line on the wig, and then, as he turns his back, the costume is revealed as backless (a gag pirated from the actor Terry Scott).  Billy Dainty was one of the last dames to have his own costumes - today most costumes are provided by the production management.",
