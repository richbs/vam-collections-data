The Christ Child reaches forward to play with the pages of the book, which St Anne holds.  The right half of this book, and St Anne's forefinger and thumb were made separately, and are held in place with a wooden dowel.  The back is flat, with a vertical groove, and has been left uncarved and largely unpainted.  There is no Malines mark visible.  There are two small holes on the underside of the group, presumably for fixing it to a separate socle.",

The Child reaches forward to play with the pages of the book in St Anne's left hand. The sculptor made the right half of the book and St Anne's forefinger and thumb separately and then fixed them into place with dowelling. The Virgin's head has been cut back to take a crown, now missing.  Sculptors in Malines (Mechelen, Belgium) frequently represented St Anne with the Virgin and Child in this way.",

They were relatively inexpensive, and popular for private devotion in the home.\nThe triple group of St Anne with the Virgin and Child (<font -i>Anna Selbdritt</font -i> in Germany, <font -i>Anna-te-Drie\u00ebn</font -i> in the Netherlands and <font -i>Sainte-Filiation</font -i> in France was a popular type in the late Middle Ages, celebrating the virtues of motherhood and female domesticity.  Similar versions exist in Utrecht, Malines, Boulogne and Bruges, with closely comparable stylistic characteristics.",
