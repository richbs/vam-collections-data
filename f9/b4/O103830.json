Born in Worcester  in the early 1640s, he was apprenticed to the prominent London  goldsmith Henry Greenway and eventually took over his master's  business when Greenway retired in 1670. Richardson enjoyed a  successful career: the scale of his activity is reflected in the number of  apprentices (four) attached to his workshop, and in the importance of  the commissions entrusted to him. These included candlesticks, flagons,  a basin and altar cruets for Westminster Abbey, marked for London  1684-85.\nPersonal matters appear to have motivated his return to Worcester in  around 1695, and he died there in 1697-98.\nThe initials pounced on the side of the beaker are probably those of a husband and wife, and suggest the was a marriage gift, or intended to commemorate a marriage. Nothing further is known of the cup's early owners. It was bequeathed to the Museum in 1927 by Mrs Aubrey J. Carter. The description of the maker's mark has been the source of some confusion. Originally described simply as 'R in a  shaped estucheon', it was redescribed in the mid-1990s as 'PR in  monogram over a cinquefoil'. Recent research (Davidson and Davidson:  2010) has confirmed the earlier description is the correct interpretation.",
