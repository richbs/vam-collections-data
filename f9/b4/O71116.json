On his left arm he bears the Christ Child, who is turned to his right, looking down at the saint. Kneeling on his right knee on the saint's left arm, the Child blesses him with his right hand and holds an orb in his left. In his right hand the saint holds a curved staff which bears two polyhedral leaves or buds at the top. He wears a flat hat with an upturned brim and a cloak draped from the left which leaves his legs uncovered. The Child wears a gown under a cloak fastened by a brooch.\n\nThere is a hole in the top of the orb, suggesting it formerly held a cross. The fingers of the Christ Child's right hand are damaged. Almost no paint remains. There are traces of green paint decorated with the usual daisy pattern at the bottom of the carving, beneath the water; there are traces of red paint on the inside of the saint's cloak. The back of the figure has been scratched with the numerals 'IIIV.' There are four lead-plugged holes. The bottom has been cut away.",

            "public_access_description": "There are two sorts of alabaster. Calcite alabaster is very hard and was used in ancient times. This object is made of gypsum alabaster which is a fine-grained, soft and smooth stone. Although at first glance it looks a little like marble, which it was intended to imitate, it was much easier to carve due to its softness, and alabaster objects were therefore significantly cheaper to produce. Marble does not originate in England, so it was imported if needed, whereas in the 15th century there were important alabaster quarries in Nottingham, York, Burton-on-Trent and London. England was a major centre for the production of objects such as this one. During period, they were exported in very large numbers to Europe where they survive, unlike many examples which remained in England and were destroyed or greatly damaged during the Reformation.\n\nThe saint has a spade-shaped beard and is looking to his left. He is wading through water, his right foot raised. Both feet project through the water. On his left arm he bears the Christ Child, who is turned to his right, looking down at the saint. Kneeling on his right knee on the saint's left arm, the Child blesses him with his right hand and holds an orb in his left. In his right hand the saint holds a curved staff which bears two polyhedral leaves or buds at the top. He wears a flat hat with an upturned brim and a cloak draped from the left which leaves his legs uncovered. The Child wears a gown under a cloak fastened by a brooch.\n\nThere is a hole in the top of the orb, suggesting it formerly held a cross. The fingers of the Christ Child's right hand are damaged. Almost no paint remains. There are traces of green paint decorated with the usual daisy pattern at the bottom of the carving, beneath the water; there are traces of red paint on the inside of the saint's cloak. The back of the figure has been scratched with the numerals 'IIIV.' There are four lead-plugged holes. The bottom has been cut away.",
