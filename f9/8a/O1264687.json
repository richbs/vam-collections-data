His name was inspired by \"Smokey\" Joe Martin, a firefighter in the New York City Fire Department.\nHis slogan, Remember ... only YOU can prevent forest fires, was first coined in 1947 and in 2001 the words 'forest fires' were replaced with 'wildfires' to show that other areas can also be in danger.",
