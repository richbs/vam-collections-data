George III was particularly proud of the achievements of the Academy, which he founded in 1768. The room shown is in Somerset House, London, where the Academy was initially based. The Royal Family were recorded in the Great Room there by Ramberg, whose design was engraved by P Martini and published by A Poggi on 6 March 1789, following the King's recovery from illness.\n\nThe engraving of the royal visit to Somerset House was very popular and is known in a number of variant forms. For this fan, a third version of the original Martini print, published by Poggi on 11 January 1790, has been used, which omits Sir Joshua Reynolds and other leading Academy figures, and adds three of the King's youngest children to complete a family portrait. The engraved plate had been adapted, so that the printed area was reduced to the size of a fan leaf, and the upper range of paintings removed.",

They ranged from simple, inexpensive styles with bone sticks and paper leaves to highly ornate versions which used vellum, gold and silver leaf and other inlays. This high quality printed fan, the colours added by hand, has sticks of expensive imported ivory.  The maker was Antonio Poggi who had a reputation as both fan maker and painter. He moved from Rome to London in about 1776, possibly in the entourage of Pasquale Paoli, the Corsican patriot (1725-1807). He remained there till after 1803. He himself exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1776 and 1781. Later in his career Poggi set up as a dealer in Old Master drawings, and in 1793 he helped to sell Reynolds\u2019 collections. By 1801 he was supplying drawings to the Prince of Wales (the future George IV).  \n\nThe English novelist Fanny Burney visited his shop with Reynolds in March 1781. She recorded seeing: \u2018\u2026 some beautiful fans, painted by Poggi, from designs of Sir Joshua [Reynolds], Angelica [Kauffmann], West, and Cipriani, on leather; they are, indeed, more delightful than can well be imagined: one was bespoke by the Duchess of Devonshire, for a present to some woman of rank in France, that was to cost \u00a330\u2019. This sum of money would have clothed ten labourers\u2019 families in rural southern England for a year at this time.\n\n\n<i>Comparable fans</i> \nAnother fan mount in the Museum's collection (museum number E.771-1925) has an almost identical print. See also the print by Martini after Ramberg, museum number 27807, which is dated 1787. Examples in other collections are listed in Roberts, Sutcliffe and Mayor (see refs), including a fan in the Royal Collection. That version has japanned bamboo guards and sticks. RCIN 25074.
