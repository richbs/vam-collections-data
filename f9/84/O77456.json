Such commemorative medals were made in great numbers for sale to the public.\n\nPeople\nFrank Bowcher, the designer of  this medal, was the pupil of Edouard Lanteri (1848-1917), a French sculptor who had settled in Britain, and who taught at the Government School of Design at South Kensington (later the Royal College of Art). Lanteri inculcated his pupils with a new sense of naturalism, in contrast to the classicism seen in British sculpture of the mid-19th century. Bowcher flourished from the 1890s onwards, and produced a number of important medals.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThis medal was struck in bronze. Struck medals were produced from metal dies engraved with the design in reverse. A flat disc was placed between the dies, which were then compressed, so that the design was reproduced on the metal. This technique meant that a high number of medals could be made using the same dies over and over, whereas the technique of casting medals could be more complex, and generally smaller numbers were made.",
