The overall decoration, in a comparatively restrained  'art' style, was made to appeal to the widest possible, yet fashion-conscious, home-owning market.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe production of earthenware with painted pictorial decoration was developed at the Lambeth factory of Doulton & Co. around 1872. Five years earlier in the international exhibition, Paris, similar wares by the French potter Joseph-Th\u00e9odore Deck (1823-1891) and Wedgwood wares painted by Emile Lessore had been exhibited, and in 1871  Minton's had opened their Art Pottery studio, specialising in painted wares, in Kensington Gore, London. Doulton's decided to follow this new fashion with the production of  'Lambeth faience'.\n\nPeople\nMary Capes was one of the many decorating artists who worked for the studio production. Between about 1876 and 1883 she was a faience designer and painter and she also developed a technique for painting in enamel colours on stoneware.",
