He has a sword. Behind the front four figures, visible between Harlequin and Silvie, another capped and masked character, Scapin, looks out over them from behind the curtain.

            "public_access_description": "This etching is one of ten made by the printmaker Louis Surugue after paintings by Jean-Antoine Watteau. Watteau painted a number of theatrical subjects and also used them as part of his larger compositions of gatherings called 'f\u00eates galantes'. The text below this etching focusses on the character Crispin's flirtation with the young lady and suggests that theatre, though comedy, often reflects life. \n\nCommedia dell'arte was an Italian form of improvised comedy, interspersed with musical and acrobatic routines, performed by troupes of travelling performers from the middle of the 16th century. It became popular throughout Europe and in royal courts, especially in France, and influenced other dramatic forms. \n\nCostumes of the commedia dell'arte characters would be instantly recognisable to viewers based on the social status suggested by the costume of the non-masked characters, such as the lovers (innamorati), around whom the stories often revolved, and the coloured leather masks, costume, props and gestures of the stock comic characters. The Harlequin, recognisable by his contrasting, two-colour costume and black mask, was one of the scheming servants (zanni). Pierrot is a variant of the melancholic character Pedrolino, who wore white and a whitened face. Scapino is a variant of the character Brighella.\n\nThe painting after which this etching was made was owned by Sir Joshua Reynolds and is now in the Waddeson Collection.",
