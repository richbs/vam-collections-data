For many years he worked with his brother Frederick (1877-1938) and together they built up an increasingly profitable and successful business. 'The Melville Brothers', as they were known, leased several theatres in London, taking over the Lyceum Theatre in 1909 and building the Princes Theatre (Shaftesbury Theatre) in 1911. The majority of their productions were melodramas (many written by the brothers themselves), but the pantomimes they staged at the Lyceum Theatre proved equally popular. \n\nThis item is one of several theatrical drawings from a collection of sketches commissioned from contemporary artists to be printed in illustrated magazines.
