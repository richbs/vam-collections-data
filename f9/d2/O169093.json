In each of the remaining compartments is one of the 24 Jain Tirthankaras seated in meditative posture. At the base of the piece are five figures and two lightly incised lions. The rightmost of these figures at the base may be Padmavati, with her consort Dharanendra on the left - the yakshi and yaksha of Parshvanatha. The composition is enlivened by the swirling floriate forms emerging from the mouth of the expressive kirttimukha (face of glory) that dominates the apex of the main arch, whose top is in the form of makara torana.",
