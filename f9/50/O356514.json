The scenes show episodes in the life of a peasant family. In the centre, an old man is seated and his wife leans on her stick by his side. They are greeting a young man and a young woman with a child in her arms. The elder children of this couple are giving bunches of flowers to the old woman. On the left of the scene is a cottage by a mill race, and above is part of a scene with a young man kneeling before a girl and he presents her with a nest in which are three fledglings. Above the central scene is part of a farmyard with ducklings and other birds and animals. Between the main island groups are smaller scenes with the young couple clasping one another's hands, a ship at sea, and a woman rowing two others in a boat.\n\nThe valance is lined with white cotton and has a scalloped edge trimmed with red and white cotton fringe.",
