They were created by artists, block cutters and printers working independently to the instructions of specialist publishers. Bird and flower prints such as this were very popular. Katsushika Hokusai was especially famous for his work in this field. His signature appears on the bottom right of the image, along with the official censor's seal and that of the publisher. Above the picture is a description of the image and, to the left, a poem. There was an enormous demand for these exciting, colourful works among merchants and artisans. When Japanese prints first reached the West they were also relatively inexpensive, but they soon became highly prized items and prices rose considerably. Hokusai became the best known and most admired Japanese print artist in the West. His depictions of natural forms had a profound influence on British artists and designers.",
