At the French court chefs named dishes in honour of their distinguished patrons. Sauce boats and tureens generally had accompanying ladles and dishes. For the grandest and most elaborate of commissions, as here, they were made to match the rest of the dinner service. By the 1730s the form of sauce boats had developed to the single handle and wide pouring lip that is still used today.\n\nPeople\nPaul Storr (1771-1844) was one of the greatest of goldsmiths working in Regency London.  He registered his mark as an independent goldsmith, but his career was inextricably linked with the firm of Rundell, Bridge and Rundell, who appointed him workshop manager in 1807, making him a partner in the firm soon after. Much of the firm's output between 1807 and 1819 is struck with Storr's mark.  He worked in an assured Neo-classical manner that proved highly popular with the firm's royal and aristocratic clients.",
