The sides paneled, with two horizontal panels divided by a rail with scratch mouldings. The bottom formed by pine dust boards (nailed up?).\nWormy PL top rail (sapwood).\nOnly one drawer (the second) opened using the key: pine back nailed onto oak sides, with two large dovetails holding the front to the sides. Brass handles. Side grooves correspond to evidence of drawer hangers (now removed) and pine runners have been nailed under the drawer in place of the original system of suspension. Applied mouldings on the drawer fronts, and scratch 'dentils' along the freize just below the top.\nThe feet apparently original, with some repairs.\nDamage: a section of geometric moulding lost (recent), and one drawer handle missing a bolt and the handle loop.",

Lidded chests had traditionally been used for storage, but items stored at the bottom of a deep chest were difficult to get at. Storage in relatively shallow drawers was much more convenient. Joiners developed strong joints, known as dovetails, for the drawers to withstand heavy use. \n\nIn most respects of design and construction, this chest is characteristic of the period 1670-1730. For instance, the drawers are decorated with applied geometric mouldings, and they have a deep horizontal groove in the middle of each side which runs on a ledge inside the case. Both these features were out of fashion by about 1730. However, the bracket feet, which appear to be original, suggest it was made after 1730, and the swan-neck handles - also apparently original - point to an even later date, in the 1760s or later.\n\nOn loan to the Elizabethan House, Plymouth.",
