His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nMessel\u2019s interior design commissions included the redecoration of John Wood Elder\u2019s Assembly Rooms (1771) on behalf of the National Trust from 1961 to 1963, which were gutted by war time bombing in 1942 and and rebuilt in 1956.  Messel attempted to recreate the original designs using scant photographic documentation.  The redecoration work included wall colours, fixtures and fittings for the Octagon and Ballroom.  Designss for a bar in the Octagon and furniture for the Tea Room remained unexecuted. \n\nDue to changing tastes in historic building restoration toward strict historical accuracy in the late 1970s, Messel\u2019s decorative scheme was found to be inappropriate and replaced by David Mlinaric\u2019s designs in 1979.  Of Messel's designs, only the ceiling moulding in the ballroom remains in situ.",

The redecoration included wall colours, mirrors for the Octagon and Ballroom, furniture for the Tea Room and a bar for the Octagon (Messel\u2019s furniture and bar designs were never executed).  Messel\u2019s decorative scheme was replaced by designs by David Mlinaric in 1979.  \nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's theatre designs and other designs and artefacts.  The designs were briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being housed at the V&A from 1981 on indefinite loan.  The V&A Theatre Museum purchased the Oliver Messel collection from Lord Snowdon in 2005.",
