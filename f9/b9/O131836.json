            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of British Oil Paintings 1820-1860</i>, Ronald Parkinson, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1990, p. 277\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"<b>STANFIELD, Clarkson, RA</b> (1793-1867) \nBorn Sunderland 3 December 1793, son of an actor and wine merchant. Apprenticed to a heraldic painter in Edinburgh 1806, entered Merchant Navy 1808, Royal Navy 1812, discharged through illness 1814. Worked as scenery painter in London and Edinburgh theatres, painted panoramas and dioramas, as well as easel pictures. Exhibited 135 works at the RA between 1820 and 1867, 22 at the BI 1820-53, and 21 at the SBA 1824-29 (elected Member 1824, President 1829). Subjects almost all marine, river and coastal scenes. Elected to Sketching Society 1829, ARA 1832, RA 1835. Curator of Greenwich Hospital from 1844. Toured the Continent 1830 and 1838-9, and France 1832. Illustrated Heath's 'Picturesque Annuals' (1832, 1833, 1834), published 'Coast Scenery' 1836, and 'Sketches on the Moselle ... ' (1838). Friend of David Roberts RA and Charles Dickens. Died Hampstead, London, 18 May 1867. His son George Clarkson Stanfield was also an artist; his studio sales were at Christie's 8 May 1868 and 23 March 1876. Much admired by Ruskin, his skill at rendering both sea and sky - despite sometimes showing his theatrical interests too clearly - make him, after Turner, the most distinguished marine painter in Britain of the century. \n\nLIT: <u>Art Journal</u> 1857, pp137-9; <u>Gentleman's Magazin</u> July 1867 (obit); J Dafforne <u>Pictures by Clarkson Stanfield RA nd </u>[1873]; P van der Merwe <u>The Life and Theatrical Career of Clarkson Stanfield</u> Bristol University PhD thesis 1979, and <u>The Spectacular Career of Clarkson Stanfield</u> Tyne and Wear County Council Museums exhibition catalogue 1979 (with bibliography) \n\n\n\n<b>The Action and Capture of the Spanish Xebeque Frigate 'El Gamo' </b>\n364-1901 Neg 59312 \nCanvas, 132.1 X 183.9 cm (52 X 72 3/8 ins) \nBequeathed by Mrs Julia Anne Bonnor 1901 \n\nExhibited at the RA in 1845, with the full title given in the catalogue together with an extensive explanation of the subject: \nThe action and capture of the Spanish xebeque frigate El Gamo, of 32 guns and 319 men, commanded by Don Francisco de Torris, and H.M. sloop Speedy, of 14 four-pounders and 54 men, commanded by Lord Cochrane (now Earl Dundonald) off Barcelona, on the 6th May, 1801. After a mutual chase and warm action, the El Gamo was carried by boarding; the commander of the Speedy (Lord Cochrane) ordering every soul in the brig to board, leaving only the surgeon, Mr Guthrie, in \ncharge of the helm. The Speedy had eight wounded and three killed; the \nEl Gamo had 45 wounded, and 14 killed, including the Commander, \nDon Francisco de Torris. From the great disparity of force, this was justly \nconsidered one of the most gallant exploits of the last war. \n\nThe famous episode was described in detail by William James in <i>The Naval History of Great Britain ... </i>published 1822-6. \n\nThe work was painted for Commander Charles Spencer Ricketts RN (the father of the donor) who served as midshipman in the action. A label, perhaps written by Ricketts, on the frame briefly recounts the episode. A visitor informed the museum in 1908 that the figure on the spar was a portrait of the artist's son, while the boy hauling down the Spanish colours was \nMidshipman Ricketts. \n\nPROV: Commander Ricketts RN; by descent to his daughter Mrs Julia Anne Bonnor, who bequeathed it to the museum 1901 \n\nEXH: RA 1845 (254) \n\n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
