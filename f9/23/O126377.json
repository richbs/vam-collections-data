However, this has never been mounted as a fan. It is possible that the quality of the painting meant that this has been preserved as an object in itself. The scene is copied from a sketch by the artist Guido Reni (1575-1642), a painter of popular religious works and acclaimed mythological scenes. Fan painters imitated the styles of such well known artists. Although fan painters were regarded as artisans and copyists, in this case their work has been prized. The scene depicted on the fan leaf shows the meeting of Ariadne and Bacchus, the God of Wine, on the island of Naxos. According to Greek legend, Ariadne was abandoned by Theseus on the island as she slept, and was discovered by Bacchus and made his consort.",
