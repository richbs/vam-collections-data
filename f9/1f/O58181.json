He established the Mona Marble and Furniture Works in Tenterden Street, Hanover Square, and had several important commissions, including supplying furniture for the use of the exiled Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte on St. Helena. Bullock preferred to use native woods, such as oak or larch, for his furniture, with Mona marble slabs from the quarry he purchased on Anglesey. The combination of ebony and brass inlay is unusual for Bullock and suggests the influence of French Empire furniture. Instead of Mona marble, this top is made of specimens of classical Roman marbles which must have been imported. However the brass pattern of hops on the base of the table shows Bullock's characteristic use of British motifs in his inlay, rather than the conventional classical vine motif.",
