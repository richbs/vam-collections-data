There is no physical separation between the segments, only a change of painted ground colour. The face of each character is portrayed facing forward while their bodies taper to their waists which meet at the centre of the disc.  At the centre, a rough cabochon ruby is surmounted by a paste diamond-like 'brilliant'. \n\nThe character at the top, opposite to the position the pin points, is a woman wearing a blue dress with white lace collar and a black headdress against a pale grey ground.  Going clockwise, the next character is a pierrot in striped doublet with white ruff and striped headdress.  Next is a young woman (?) in embroidered yellow costume with low lace edge square neckline and a red cloak on whose head is a coronet with coloured feathers.  She bears a sword and may be represent perhaps the Roman goddess Bellona or possibly a Queen of the Amazons.  Next to her is a man in grey whose nightcap appears to be falling from his head.  The Pierrot, goddess/queen and man in grey are all painted against a black ground.  The last character painted against a light blue ground is a man in black doublet, white ruff and cuffs.  His black sleeves are slashed to reveal pink beneath and his black hat bears a pink feather.",
