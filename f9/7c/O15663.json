The entire skirt is decorated with regularly placed, matching buttons. The light, natural colour of the straw stands out in marked  contrast to the black fabric, transforming a classic design into a stiking garment. It belonged to the actress Miss Martita Hunt, who must have enjoyed wearing it.\n\nJacques Heim, who designed the dress, was born in Paris. He began to extend his parents' establishment, which specialised in furs, into a couture house in 1920. In 1935 he moved to 15 avenue Matignon, Paris, and launched 'Heim Jeunes Filles' in 1936. His business closed in 1969.",

            "bibliography": "Mendes, V., & Wilcox, C., 'Modern Fashion in Detail' (V&A Publications: London, 1991), p.78 - ISBN 1851770321\nA pair of unusual, coiled straw buttons emphasised the shaped, cross-over bodice of this cool, black linen summer dress of about 1948.  The entire skirt is also embellished with regularly placed, matching buttons.  They are made from fine, plaited straw strips rolled into tight, neat spirals and secure with thread.  The light natural colour of the straw stands out in contrast against the smooth black linen, transforming and artfully cut, but plain dress into an inventively trimmed and striking garment.  The buttons on the bodice perform a function in securing the cross-over panels and convey the idea of operational fastenings by the inclusion of false bound buttonholes but neither they, nor those on the skirt, had to withstand the wear and tear of daily use.  As a result, the straw coils remain in pristine condition, despite being fragile and perishable.  Use of such an unconventional and cheap material was probably a legacy from the war-time shortages of more lavish trimmings and fabrics of high fashion.\n\nJacques Heim was one of the first tope designers to investigate the potential of ready-to-wear.  This dress has historical significance because it is a rare and early model from his ready-made range, Heim Actualite.",
