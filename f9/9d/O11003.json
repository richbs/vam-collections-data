The shell is set in magnificent silver-gilt mounts that transform it into a luxurious display piece.\n\nMaterial & Technique\nThe hard outer layers of the shell have been removed, either by scraping or by using acid, to reveal the nacreous (mother-of-pearl) layer underneath, which has been polished. The decorative engraving has been blackened to provide a sharp contrast with the iridescent body.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe design of the mounts and the engraving on the shell accentuate the marine origins of the shell itself. The accomplished engraving of the shell depicts specimens of marine life interspersed with floral and scrolling motifs. These were probably taken from a print source such as Johannes Johnstones' compilation of  Historiae Naturalis de Piscibus ('Natural History of Fish', 1650-1653) by the Roman author Pliny the Elder (died 79 AD). The elaborate silver-gilt mounts incorporate marine monsters amongst waves, fish and serpents. The cover takes the form of a sea god astride a marine monster, while maidens from the Americas make up the strap mounts.\n\nOwnership & Use\nA taste for mounted nautilus cups had flourished in Northern Europe since at least the 14th century. Shells were highly prized as exotic and rare objects as well as for their talismanic (magical) properties.",
