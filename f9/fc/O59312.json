The interior of the garden house was decorated with traditional Hungarian motifs including stylised floral and leaf decoration, and the set of furniture with similar decoration was made by L\u00f6rincz Lengyel, a cabinetmaker in Szeged, Hungary. It was shown at the Paris International Exhibition of 1900 and bought by Sir George Donaldson, a London dealer who was commissioned by the South Kensington Museum (the V&A\u2019s predecessor) to buy modern works of art for the collection.",
