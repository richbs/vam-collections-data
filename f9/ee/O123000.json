            "public_access_description": "This lidded jar is decorated with reproductions of Sir Joshua Reynolds' 1762 painting of David Garrick being torn between Comedy and Tragedy, and his 1763 painting of the Graces decorating Hymen. The Garrick subject was probably chosen by Garrick as a playful parody of the classical story of Hercules choosing between pleasure and virtue, designed to emphasise his versatility as an actor. Reynolds presents the figures of Comedy and Tragedy in the style of the Italian artists Antonio Correggio and Guido Reni.\n\nDavid Garrick (1717-1779) was recognised during his lifetime as one of the greatest actors ever in both comic and tragic roles, and it is this universal aspect of his acting that Reynolds celebrated in his painting.  Garrick was born in Hereford and came to London in 1737 to work as a wine merchant but made his London debut as an actor in 1741 at Goodman's Fields Theatre as Richard III.. He managed the Theatre Royal Drury Lane from 1747 until 1776 and was depicted during his lifetime in many of his most famous roles, especially in paintings by Johann Zoffany (1733-1810).",
