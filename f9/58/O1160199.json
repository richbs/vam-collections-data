Rich was a theatre manager by inheritance receiving a three-quarter share in Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre from his father, Christopher Rich, in 1714. After running that house successfully for 18 years, he founded Covent Garden Theatre in 1732. At both theatres he staged entertainments of a new type based on Italian foundations known as pantomime. Rich had a taste for acting, and at first tried his hand at tragedy. He was not a success but found his ideal role in 1717 when he appeared as Harlequin in a pantomime called Harlequin Executed. Until then, Harlequin had been a speaking part. It was Rich, or  Lun as he chose to bill himself, who originated the silent Harlequin. By mere dumb action he could rival the power and pathos of the most accomplished  tragedian. His powers of mime were praised by the actor-manager David Garrick, and he continued to appear as Harlequin until his death in 1761.",
