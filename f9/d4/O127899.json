As an apprentice to his father, he made figures in clay, attracting the interest of the portrait painter Alexander Mosses (1793-1837). Studied in his spare time at the drawing school of the Royal Institution, Liverpool, and apprenticed to a local painter and engraver. Achieved local success as a portrait painter and for his 'candlelight' studies, and exhibited frequently at the Liverpool Academy from 1831, although he did not become a member. Exhibited seven works at the RA in 1840 and 1846, all single figure studies such as a beggar and a friar, except for the portrait of ' Sir Joshua Walmsley' (see p65) who seems to have been his chief patron. The <i>Magazine of Art</i> writer recorded that he 'lived boisterously ... But he also felt the fascination of strong drink'; he is supposed to have declined to paint Prince Albert. He died at Everton, 13 October 1880. \n\nLIT: <i>Magazine of Art</i> June 1882, pp341-3; H C Marillier <i>The Liverpool School of Painters</i> 1904, pp95-8 \n\n<b>James M Walmsley as a Boy</b> \n371-1872 Neg H312 \nCanvas, 50.8 x 37.5 cm (20 x 14\u00be ins) \nBequeathed by Sir Joshua Walmsley 1872 \n\nPresumably also a son of Sir Joshua Walmsley.\"",
