            "public_access_description": "The Mass of St Gregory the Great roundel illustrates a legend that arose in the late Middle Ages concerning the Real Presence in the bread and wine consecrated at the Mass. According to this, two pagans questioned whether the bread and wine actually become the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ at the consecration. St Gregory, when celebrating Mass at the altar, prayed to God to help these pagans. God granted him a vision of the Resurrected Christ displaying his wounds. The blood from Christ\u2019s side poured into the chalice and the bread, the Host, was infused with his body. The on-looking pagans were converted to the Christian faith by these signs.\n\nSt Gregory the Great was pope between 590 and 604 and was instrumental in devising the liturgy of the Mass. The earliest known reference to these miraculous legends dates to about the middle of the 13th century. \n\nBy the end of the Middle Ages, a strong devotion had arisen associated with the wounds that Christ incurred during his Crucifixion. These were the marks of the nails left in his hands and feet, and the wound in his side, caused when a Roman soldier stuck in a spear to see if he was still alive. \n\nIn this roundel, Christ is surrounded by the Instruments of the Passion (events leading to his death). These include the Crown of Thorns, the spear, the column to which he was tied and the whips used to scourge him. This type of imagery is known as the 'Image of Pity' or 'The Man of Sorrows'. It was meant to create an emotional response in the viewer to the sufferings of Christ.",

            "historical_context_note": "The Doctrine of Transubstantiation was defined as an article of dogma at the Fourth Lateran Council (1215). This is not when it first appears but, rather, a long tradition of belief in the real presence in the Mass was defined at this time. \n\nPope Gregory the Great, amongst other early Church leaders, insisted that the Mass in its essential nature must be that which Christ Himself characterized as a \"commemoration\" of Him (Luke 22:19). He was instrumental in creating the form of the Mass as practised in the Catholic Church today.\n\nIn the middle of the 13th century, a Dominican monk, Jacobus de Voragine (later archbishop of Genoa), compiled a manuscript of stories currently in vogue on the lives of the saints of the Church. The proclamations of the Fourth Lateran Council, especially that of transubstantiation, quickly found their way into the popular imagination and into contemporary literature.\n\nJacobus records in his chapter on St Gregory:\nA certain woman used to bring altar breads [that she had made] to Gregory...one Sunday, when the time came for receiving communion and he held out the Body of the Lord to her, saying 'May the Body of Our Lord...' she laughed...he asked her why...'Because you called this bread, which I made with my own hands, the Body of the Lord'. Then Gregory, faced with the woman's lack of belief, prostrated himself in prayer, and when he rose, he found the particle of bread changed into flesh in the shape of a finger. Seeing this, the woman recovered her faith.\n\nBy the early 15th century, another legend appears or it could be a modification of the one recorded by Jacobus, of a Roman matron who doubted the real presence. In this story, the wine in the chalice changes to the blood of Christ.\n\nAnother late legend relates that Gregory the Great was once saying mass in the church of Santa Croce in Gerusaleme in Rome when some pagans entered the building and began mocking the ceremony.  Praying for a sign to show the unbelievers that the mass was a divinely instituted service, a vision of the Crucified Christ appeared above the altar, surrounded by the instruments of his Passion.\n\nImages of the Mass of St. Gregory the Great do not seem to depict a clear or specific narrative, serving instead as a general representation of a miraculous event meant to confirm the doctrine of transubstantiation, that Christ truly is present in the bread and wine of the mass.",
