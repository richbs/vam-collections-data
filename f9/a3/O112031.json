It was Nijinsky's first and only surviving ballet. According to The Encyclopaedia of Dance and Ballet, edited by Mary Clarke and David Vaughan, in it he 'made a radical departure from orthodox methods of composition; the dancers moved in two-dimensional profile, flat-footed, turned in, and the choreography was not tied to the metre of the music.  These innovations were of more long-lasting significance than the scandal provoked at the premiere by the Faun's final suggestive caressing of a scarf dropped by a startled nymph, a gesture modified at subsequent performances'",
