It became the role most closely associated with Elssler and an iconic image of the Romantic Ballet.\n\nThe figurine has been attributed to the French sculptor Jean Auguste Barre as an alternative, and possibly earlier, version of his figurine of Elssler in the same pose and role.  This version however has a much simpler skirt, undecorated and unpetticoated, which relates it more obviously to the Romantic Ballet 'uniform' tutu and to the Taglioni Sylphide figure, to which this is the companion piece.  Fanny Elssler was born in Vienna where she performed from an early age, but she was still a teenager when she was dancing to great acclaim in Berlin, Paris and London.",

It became the role most closely associated with Elssler and an iconic image of the Romantic Ballet.\nThe figure is an alternative, and possibly earlier, version of the Barre figurine of Elssler in the same pose and role, but this version has a much simpler skirt, undecorated and unpetticoated, which relates it more obviously to the Romantic Ballet 'uniform' tutu and to the Taglioni Sylphide figure, to which this is the companion piece.\nThe figurine came to the museum as part of the Cyril Beaumont Bequest.\n\nHistorical significance: One of the 'iconic' images of the Romantic Ballet. Elssler personified the alternative attributes of the Romantic Ballet, against Taglioni's air and spirit, she was fire and earth, and this figure captures her in her defining role.",
