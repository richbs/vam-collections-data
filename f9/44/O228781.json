There is a border around the four sides with a blue/green meander and red and cream flowers and light yellow leaves. The same pattern forms a horizontal band across the upper and lower part of the cover and 2 vertical bands along either side. These create a wide border and 4 square corner sections.  Each corner contains a stem with one red and 2 cream flowers, yellow buds and blue leaves. Across the top and bottom there are three sprays, the central one is larger and all 3 are carnation flowers in the same colours as the corner units. The side panels contain 3 large and 2 small sprays.  The central panel has 5 bands, each with 2 or 3 small carnation sprays. A small floral motif is scattered among the larger motifs. The flowers in the wide border face inwards.\nBacking: pieced; coarse white cotton.\nA short black silk fringe has been added.",
