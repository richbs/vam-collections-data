The socks are also marked with the number 6, which means that the wearer had at least six pairs of socks, each pair of which would be separately numbered from 1 to 6.  Marks like this enabled clothes to be checked as present, and also given to the correct wearer in a family after they had been washed.  More basic marks were used well into the 1950s by many families sending clothes away to the laundry for washing.",
