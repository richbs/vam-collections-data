His monogram appears in the scroll at the bottom of the roundel.\n\nThe subject depicted on this panel is the story of the 'Clemency of Trajan'. This subject would have had special relevance to the person or persons who commissioned this panel. The image is derived from an engraving by the artist Hans Sebald Beham who executed this work in 1537.\n\nThe story of the Clemency of Trajan was recorded as early as the mid 13th century in the 'Golden Legend'. A widow, as seen in red in the centre of the panel, begs vengeance for the death of her son from the Emperor Trajan. Trajan, mindful of justice for the weak and innocent, offers up the life of his own son who had been responsible for the murder of the widow's son.\n\nIn the middle of the 16th century new techniques for producing decorated glass were introduced. Glass paints known as \u2018enamels\u2019 were painted directly onto the glass. The colours were produced by adding metallic oxides to a glass frit mixture. The resulting colour range included strong purples, greens and blues, as we see here. Lead lines are still used to form part of the design, but the imagery is primarily a painted one.",

He heard appeals from the highest courts \nthroughout his dominion, and the final sentence he pro- \nnounced assumed the validity of a legal enactment. The \nclemency of Trajan was as conspicuous as his love of justice, \nand to him is ascribed the noble sentiment, that it is better \nthat the guilty should escape than the innocent suffer.",
