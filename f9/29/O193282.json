The shells have the appearance of porcelain because of their pale colour and polished surface. In the past they were highly prized and sought after for their decorative qualities. In Africa they were used as a form of currency for centuries as well as appearing on ceremonial dress and jewellery.\n\nThese cowrie shells were intended for use as game counters and were packed by the famous Chad Valley Company in the 1930's. Shells, pieces of bone and polished pebbles were often used as game pieces before the widespread use of plastics. These counters could have been used with range of games such as Ludo, Snakes and Ladders, and Jacks.",
