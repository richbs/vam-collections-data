The pendant leaves were deliberately hung loosely from their mounts, so that they flickered when worn, reflecting the light and making a noise like bells.  This was intended to deflect any potential evil from the bride, and demonstrates the survival of a belief dating back to medieval times.\n\nIt was given to the museum in 1908, together with some other Dalmatian traditional jewellery, by Aylmer Vallance, a leading member of the Oxford Movement in the 19th century, and a supporter of William Morris\u2019 Arts and Crafts.  It was originally described as a Norwegian belt, probably due to the numerous leaf-shaped pendants.",
