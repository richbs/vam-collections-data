The Technophone was one of the first so-called Second Generation mobile phones. It was smaller than its brick-like predecessors, ergonomically designed and intended to be beautiful.  This was achieved by making it smaller in all its dimensions except in length wherein it was in fact longer than the originals. It was modelled upon military telephones.",
