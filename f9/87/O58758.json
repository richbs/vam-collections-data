The elegant, simple design, with its clean lines and minimal decoration, allows the beauty of the metal to speak for itself. Haglund\u2019s work was often inspired by the simple forms of Swedish silver plates and beakers made in the period 1500-1600. \n\nHaglund trained with master craftsmen in K\u00f6ping and Kristianstad. He was also a trainee in the Atelier Borgila, the workshop of Erik Fleming (1894-1954), one of Sweden\u2019s leading silversmiths. His experience of working abroad in South Africa, Afghanistan and the West Indies also subtly influenced his work. He has been one of the major figures and influences in Swedish post-war silversmithing, which in its turn has had an enormous international impact.",
