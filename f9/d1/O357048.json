            "public_access_description": "The top hat first appeared at the very end of the eighteenth-century and, through modification of the style, remained the dominant form of headwear for the next hundred years.\n\nThe United Kingdom's increased industrial output in the middle years of the nineteenth century meant that popular fashions which were previously out-of-reach for the majority of the population were now more accessible to men lower down the social ladder. The resemblance of the straight, high-crowned headgear to factory chimneys did not go unnoticed, nor did the fact that many wealthy industrialists wore them, and so the top hat became a symbol of affluence and urbane respectability.\n\nMost top hats were initially made from beaver felt, and so this example from the 1830s is fairly typical of its time. Beaver was superseded in the 1850s by silk plush as the material of choice for hatters. The choice of colouring may seem surprising when one imagines the somewhat staid blacks and greys of the stereotypical Victorian gentleman, though expression through flamboyant fashion was far more common in the first half of the century than it was after the death of Prince Albert.",
