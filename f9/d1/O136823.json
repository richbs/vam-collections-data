His book 'Scenery, Costumes and Architecture, chiefly on the Western side of India', published in London 1826-30, is ranked among the finest colour-plate volumes depicting views of India ever produced. Although many of the original sketches were by Grindlay, twenty-five other artists were also involved in the project. \n\nThis page sets the romantic tone of the volume, which is filled with landscapes, architectural settings and figures in vivid Oriental costume all portrayed with atmospheric effects, soft mists and golden sunlight. \n\nIn this picture the original engraving has been overpainted with oils. The mountains of the Western Ghats have been added to the engraved composition to create a romanticised idyllic setting. The engraving was based on a sketch of the daughter of Gangadhar Sastri,  Envoy to the Gaekwar of Baroda prior to the Mahratta war of 1817.",
