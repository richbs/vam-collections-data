It was probably worked by his wife, Annie Christian Jack, an accomplished needlewoman and teacher of embroidery at the South Kensington School of Design. She worked all of his designs for embroidery that were exhibited from 1889 to 1912  for the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society. \n\nJack was an architect and furniture designer who eventually became chief furniture designer at Morris & Co. The company, established by the artist and philosopher William Morris, focused on using traditional skills to create beautifully crafted objects.",
