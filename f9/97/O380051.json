This one was called the \"Medallion\" pattern, and, like others in the range, was available in a selection of colours: green, chocolate, bronze, or \"painted oak\". The Coalbrookdale ironworks were established in 1706 by Abrahan Darby (1678-1717), the first ironmaster to successfully smelt iron with coke. This breakthrough led to the mass-production of cast iron on an industrial scale, and contributed to the Industrial Revolution as a whole. The first iron bridge - which gave its name to the nearby town, iron rails and steam locomotives were produced there, but  in the 19th century the Company was also a major manufacturer of domestic cast and wrought iron goods. Its catalogues offered appliances ranging from umbrella stands to fireplaces, fruit plates and garden furniture.",
