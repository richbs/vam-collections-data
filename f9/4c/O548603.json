During this apprenticeship he attended evening classes at the West London Art School and Heatherley's School of Art. From 1892 Robinson worked as a freelance illustrator. His watercolour illustrations have a sensitivity and freedom of approach to the subject matter that was greatly helped by the introduction of the four colour printing process. \n\nThis watercolour for an unknown illustration shows a group of goblins cross examining a captured baby. The allusion to a trial is made by one of the goblins who is shown wearing a Judge's wig. The contrast between the baby's bewilderment and the knowing expressions of the surrounding goblins conveys a semi-humorous air of menace.",
