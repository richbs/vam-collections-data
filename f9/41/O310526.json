It was formerly at Scarcroft Lodge, Wetherby Road, Scarcroft, near Leeds, which became the office of the Yorkshire Electricity Board; it was probably originally in another house.\n\nHistorical significance: The shelf is supported at either side by a female figure; these are identical in design with two figures on a marble chimneypiece in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, just that those are about 10,5 inches taller than A.140-1956. This suggests that the two chimneypieces come from the same workshop, and could even may have been made for the same house. The New York piece comes from Chesterfield House in Mayfair. Chesterfield House was sold in 1869, and a few pieces, as well as the New York chimneypiece were removed beforehand and transferred to Bretby, the country seat of the earls of Chesterfield in Derbyshire. It might be possible that the present piece was also among those objects.\nThe architect of Chesterfield House was Isaac Ware (d. 1766).",
