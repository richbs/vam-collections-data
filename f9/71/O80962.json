He described the theme of the series as exploring 'that sense of being in two places, a place of the body and a place of the mind'. The imagery in the series was derived from interiors, and from groups of Coldwell's recent sculptures. The dots on the pixelated surface of the photograph are used to form constellation diagrams, and also refer to children's 'join the dots' puzzles. \n\nIn this print an image of a sliced loaf is overlaid with a constellation, and the word 'Scorpius' identifies it. The contrast between the bread and the star sign creates the tension between the spaces of the physical reality and of the mind that Coldwell discusses in the series.",
