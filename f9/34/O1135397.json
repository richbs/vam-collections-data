The heavy wool, dark houndstooth pattern, and fur lining of this garment were selected for style, but also for keeping the wearer warm and well protected from street dust, rain or snow. Such motoring-related clothing was often described as 'dust clothing,' due to its protection from the dust kicked up by motorcars from less refined lanes and tracks.",
