The rhythm guitarist John Lennon (1940-1980) is widely regarded as the founder of  the group which began in 1960, and with Paul McCartney was one of the group's two song-writers.  Despite his passion for peace, spirituality and love, he was tragically shot dead at the age of forty by the psychopath Mark Chapman, who felt it his duty to kill him.\n\nThe earliest examples of Beatles' merchandising were produced in the United States, after the Beatles' manager Brian Epstein sold a company called Seltaeb the rights to license it.  After a flood of successful Beatles items from stockings to talcum powder, Epstein realised the lucrative potential of the market and kept firm control of all future licensing. This tile is one of a set of five produced in England, one representing each individual band member and one showing the group.",
