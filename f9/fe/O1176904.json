It shows the actor Michael MacLiammoir as Oscar Wilde in a production of The Importance of Being Oscar, Apollo Theatre in 1960. \n\nMichael MacL\u00edamm\u00f3ir (1899-1978) wrote and performed this one-man show, The Importance of Being Oscar, in 1960. Based on the life and work of Oscar Wilde it intersperses excerpts from Wilde's plays and other writings with key events from Wilde\u2019s life. The first performance of this show (starring MacLiamm\u00f3ir) took place at the Gate Theatre, Dublin in 1960. Its success was such that the production then toured across the United Kingdom and across the world. The script was published in 1963 and a filmed recording of the play was televised in Ireland by Telefis Eireann productions, (first airing on Saint Patrick's Day 1964). This production won MacLiammoir a Jacob's Award in December 1964. MacLiammoir also reprised the role in a version filmed for the BBC.",
