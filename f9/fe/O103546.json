They usually exist singly and not as one of a pair since one is usually sufficient for the intended use.  The socket is sometimes lined with paper in order to hold securely the tall thin taper.  The taper, (made of wax and non odorous) was used mainly for melting sealing wax and for lighting candles, tobacco pipes etc., and not as a source of illumination; hence the piece was sometimes called a \u2018tobacco candlestick\u2019.",
