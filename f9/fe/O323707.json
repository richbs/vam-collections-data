There is often very little difference in design and function between Muslim and Christian jewellery, and both faiths carried the same kind of amulet case.  This amulet may be Muslim, as it has stylised floral decoration on the front.  Christian amulet cases usually had pictures of saints.\n\nAmulet cases originally contained religious texts, which provided their protective power, but the shape alone was often considered sufficient to act as an amulet.  This amulet is empty, but it may have been meant to contain something, as it opens with a sliding lid at the top.\n\nSquare and rectangular amulet cases were usually worn by men, while women more often worn circular, cylindrical and triangular cases, like this one.  It was bought for 12 shillings at the International Exhibition, London, in 1872, when it was described as Albanian.",
