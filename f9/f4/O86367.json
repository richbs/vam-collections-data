The plant has a single stalk with a floral florescence showing a range of orange flowers and buds in various stages of maturity.  Four upwardly curving pinnate leaves are shown twisting and growing upwards  from the base which also has a frill of smaller lobed leaves at the front.The modelling and detailing of the plant is achieved with loosely hatched lines in deeper tones.\n      The painting has a simple inner border of strips of pale buff paper laid on the main ivory-coloured border, which also has similarly tinted paper strips at its margins.  There is a jagged strip of woven textile along the inner margin which acts as a gutter for the binding of the album.",

It contains 62 leaves on which are Mughal miniature paintings, drawing and flower studies on both sides. The binding is covered with an Indian brocade silk that may have been cut from lengths brought home by the 2nd Lord Clive, who served as Governor of Madras, 1799 to 1803.  The album was sold from Powis Castle at Sotheby's sale, 16 to 18 January 1956, lot 332A.",
