            "public_access_description": "Abigail Lane produced this wallpaper for her 1992 installation Making History, first shown at the Kunsthalle in Lucerne and subsequently at the Karsten Schubert Gallery, London. The motif is a print of her bottom, made by first sitting on a chair with an inkpad for its seat, and then on the paper. Lane is interested in the marks and physical traces we leave behind us in our daily lives, but also in how repetition and reproduction can transform these marks. This wallpaper also relates to Lane's interest in the autographic mark, and how the direct touch of the artist's hand imbues a work with authenticity and implicit value; here she plays with these ideas by using a rather more vulgar body part to make the artwork. This wallpaper may also be intended to bring to mind the work of Yves Klein who famously made prints and paintings by smearing paint on the bodies of naked women, and then directing them to press their bodies against canvases, to leave an imprint of their torsos and thighs. Klein's paintings were made in the course of public performances; Lane's wallpaper, with its modest domestic associations, suggests a more private and intimate arena.",
