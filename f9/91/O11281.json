The splat pierces the uprights of the chair, which are themselves shaped from oblong at their base to circular section at the top. The back of the chair is attenuated so the top rail is above the head of the sitter.  The elongated back uprights, continuous with the back legs, together with the long back splats that extend below the seat rail to the low stretcher, accentuate the height of the chair.  The drop-in seat is upholstered and rests on corner blocks within the frame.  The rear stretcher of the chair is a large oak block, straight above with a crescent shaped curved base.  This contrasts with the pairs of narrow dowel stretchers on the sides and between the front legs.\n\nThe construction of the chair has been altered subtly in a way that affects its appearance.  Originally the back splats were screwed to the back rail of the seat from below the seat.  This effectively pinched the splats into the seat invisibly, giving them a slight curve into the lumbar region of the sitter.  At some point, probably to relieve associated pressure on the mortices securing the splats into the oval top rail, these screws have been removed.  The back splats are now about 1cm behind the back rail of the seat, and have no inward curve.",

The parts are carefully shaped so that they alter in plan or section: most extraordinary are the back legs which are rectangular in plan at the base and then curve and taper upwards until they are circular in plan at the top. An explanation of the chair's appearance and design sources is not simple.\n\nPlaces\nThe chair was originally designed by Mackintosh for the Luncheon Room of the Argyle Street Tea Rooms in Glasgow. The owner, Kate Cranston, commissioned Mackintosh and the interior designer George Walton to decorate and furnish the rooms in 1897.\n\nOwnership & Use\nMackintosh used the same chairs in his own flat, which was designed by his wife, Margaret Macdonald, at 120 Mains Street, Glasgow in 1900.  This example may have come from the dining room.  It was one of six that remained in the collection of Margaret Macdonald upon her death in 1933.\n\nDesign & Designing\nMany of Mackintosh's designs for the Argyle Street Tea Rooms had their roots in traditional furniture types - ladder-back chairs, deep settees, wing chairs.  Although high-back chairs were fashionable around 1900, there is no obvious historical precedent for this particular design.",

ISBN 1851773088.\nThe Scottish architect and designer Charles Rennie Mackintosh was celebrated in Europe in the early 1900s, largely because of his contribution to the 1900 Vienna Secession exhibition, but his significance was forgotten in Britain until the 1950s. The V&A's 1952 exhibition \"Victorian and Edwardian Decorative Arts\" included ten pieces by Mackintosh; the Museum's first acquisition of his work, a small smokers' cabinet, followed in 1956. This chair was given by the Glasgow School of Art in 1958, with an additional group of furniture from the Ingram Street tearooms. Mackintosh had designed chairs of this rectilinear, elongated form for Miss Cranston's tearooms, 114 Argyle Street, Glasgow. When he married fellow artist and designer Margaret Macdonald in 1900, the couple reused the design for their own dining chairs, of which this is probably an example. Like much of Mackintosh's furniture, the design originated on the drawing board rather than at the work bench-construction and comfort were secondary to radical and elegant appearance.\nAlthough Mackintosh was first recognised as a pioneer of modernism in the 1930s, his reputation was more firmly established by major international exhibitions in the 1960s, including the V&A's Mackintosh centenary exhibition of 1968. \n\nLit.

The owner Catherine 'Kate' Cranston commisioned Mackintosh and George Walton to decorate the rooms in 1897.  The spatial arrangement of the Luncheon Room was undertaken by Walton who divided the long narrow room with 1.5 metre high partitions.  Billcliffe suggests Mackintosh designed the high backs of the chairs so as not to be overwhelmed by the architecture (Billcliffe, 1979, p.47).\n\nSixteen chairs of this design are visible in contemporary photographs of the Luncheon Room, although more chairs are known to have been made at a later date as a additions or replacements.\n\nIn 1900, shortly after completing the Luncheon Room, Mackintosh married Margaret Macdonald and the couple set up home in a flat in 120 Mains Street, Glasgow.  A contemporary photograph of the interior of the dining room shows a chair of this model.\n\nThis chair was one of six that remained in the collection of Margaret Macdonald upon her death in 1933.  This provenance suggests that this is one of the chairs used by the Mackintosh's in their home in Mains Street around 1900 (and at later homes), rather than a chair used in the Argyle Street Tea Rooms.\n\nBillcliffe records that Mrs Napier inherited the chairs from Margaret Macdonald, or acquired them from her estate.  She presented them to the Glasgow School of Art in 1933.  This chair was given to the V&A by Glasgow School of Art in 1958.",
