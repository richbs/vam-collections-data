The collector who owned the bowl, William Beckford (1760-1844), was fascinated by the East and had a large collection of Japanese lacquer and Chinese porcelain. He owned other pieces of metalwork made in imitation of porcelain or lacquer.\n\nPeople\nThis bowl was probably designed by Gregorio Franchi (1770-1828), Beckford's Portuguese companion and agent. Beckford commissioned the London silversmith and jeweller, James Aldridge (born 1768) to make the piece. A design book attributed to James Aldridge is in the Department of Prints, Drawings and Paintings at the V&A.\n\nOwnership & Design\nAs a reflection of William Beckford's obsession with his lineage, heraldic elements formed an important part of the decoration of many pieces in his collection. There are six Hamilton cinquefoils enclosing a Latimer cross fleury engraved on the interior of this dish.  Beckford's mother was a Hamilton and in 1810, his daughter, Susan Euphemia, married Alexander, Marquis of Douglas, later to become the 10th Duke of Hamilton. William Beckford also claimed descent from William, 1st Lord Latimer.",
