The face recalls a funfair mask with a Stalin-style moustache. The poster was designed by Franti\u0161ek Tom\u00edk, who wanted to capture the situation in Czechoslovakia after the general strike on the 27th of November, before the \u2018Government of National Understanding\u2019 was established and president Gust\u00e1v Hus\u00e1k resigned on the 10th of December. \n\nThe two decades of Gust\u00e1v Hus\u00e1k\u2019s presidency in Czechoslovakia were known as the period of \u2018normalisation\u2019. In April 1969, after a period of political liberalisation known as the \u2018Prague Spring\u2019 was crushed, Hus\u00e1k replaced Alexander Dubcek as the first secretary of the Communist Party. Under Hus\u00e1k\u00b4s leadership party purges began and many who had participated in the \u2018Prague Spring\u2019 were excluded or erased from the Communist Party membership. Many of them also lost their jobs. \n\nOn the 10th of  December 1970, the KSC  [Communist Party of Czechoslovakia] Central Committee, led by Hus\u00e1k, accepted a document  (\u2018Instruction for the Critical Evolution of the Party and Society after the 13th Czechoslovak Communist Party Congress\u2019) that initiated the \u2018normalisation\u2019 process. This statement declared that the \u2018Prague Spring\u2019 was counterrevolutionary and that the occupation of Czechoslovakia by five Warsaw Pact armies in August 1968 was an act of \u2018brotherly help\u2019. It also approved the so called \u2018Brezhnev doctrine\u2019 of limited sovereignty, giving Soviet troops the right to intervene in Czechoslovakia and legalising their occupation of the country which lasted for the next twenty years. \n\nThis cartoon by Franti\u0161ek Tom\u00edk illustrates the slogan \u2018Don't Let Us Fall Asleep\u2019 and reminds people of the danger of a return of the old neo-Stalinist rules and leaders. Its aim was to keep the revolutionary euphoria going to fulfil the demands for full democracy and not to accept the communist charade of \u2018democratization\u2019. Another powerful slogan at the time was \u2018Not Democratization \u2013 but Democracy\u2019. \n\n\nDesigned, printed and published in former Czechoslovakia",
