From the apex to the centre of the longest edge is a square lozenge delineated in red and black with one line of inscription.  The lozenge is divided by red lines into a grid of small squares, each approx. 0.5 cm square.  There are 10201 squares [101 x 101] and each  contains a word.  The same word is repeated across the squares of that row and, consequently, along the diagonal.\nThe rest of the ground is undecorated except for one corner in which there is a group of small panels with  inscriptions and the date in black . There is a 'magic square' in red [9 x 9 squares] and  an inscription on red lines which might be the name of the calligrapher.",
