            "history_note": "Bill Brandt was perhaps Britain's greatest 20th century photographer. He took up photography when living in Vienna in the 1920s, and spent three months assisting the surrealist Man Ray in his studio in Paris (1929-30) before settling in London in 1931. During the 1930s and early 40s Brandt contributed reportage to various illustrated magazines, including Picture Post and Lilliput, and published several books, starting with The English at Home in 1936. He developed an expressive style, combining social observation with a subtle streak of strangeness. During the 1940s he also worked as a portraitist and landscape photographer. From 1945 Brandt began to concentrate on the female nude, using a wide-angle lens to produce images of surreal distortion. His work has been highly influential on subsequent generations of British photographers.",
