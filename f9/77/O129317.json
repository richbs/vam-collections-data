Mathmos frequently commissions designs from progressive young designers, and develops innovative technologies for its products.\n\nThe form of the Airswitch Az lamp was designed by Shin Azumi in 2005. Similar to the smaller Airswitch Tc lamp (Museum No W.7&8-2006), the mechanics of the lamp use technology that was developed by the Mathmos Design Studio in 2004. The user can control the light level by the position of their hand. Passing a hand vertically over the lamp bowl turns the light on or off. Raising or lowering a hand above the bowl makes the light brighter or dimmer. Infra red sensors inside the lamp pick up the movement. \n\nThe lamp won a Design Classic Award from House and Gardens magazine following its exhibition in the Design Classic showcase, held at the V&A in 2005.",
