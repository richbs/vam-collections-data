Alternatively, it may have been used as a stand for a sauceboat, as silver sauceboat stands of this shape are known. The shape was clearly a popular one at Chelsea, for many of these dishes survive, some painted with botanical or landscape decoration and others with Japanese patterns.\n\nPeople\nNicholas Sprimont (1716-1773) made silver sauceboats with stands of this shape in 1747-8, before he abandoned his career as a silversmith in order to devote himself to making porcelain at Chelsea. Sprimont  was a gifted designer and modeller and probably designed these dishes. A visitor to England said of the Chelsea factory's earliest years that 'an able French artist' supplies 'or directs the models of everything manufactured there'. Sprimont was not actually French, but was from the French-speaking part of Flanders.\n\nTrading\nThe Chelsea factory aimed at the top end of the market. It sold its wares from the factory site, from factory-run warehouses in the West End of London, through London ceramic dealers and at auction held in London, Dublin and probably elsewhere.",
