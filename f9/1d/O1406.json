This drinking vessel is an example of a  range made for export to Northern Europe. Their fairly basic forms were intended to cut production costs and also to appeal to a more austere taste.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe fundamental parts of a wine glass - bowl, stem and foot  -  were traditionally made as separate pieces.  They all offer some scope for decoration, although the foot is almost always plain. Here, the rim of the bowl is elegantly thin and the bottom of the bowl is reinforced by mould-blown ribbing. The stem was blown into a mould to produce a bulbous but stylish knop (swelling) imitating metalwork. A restrained trail of blue glass suggests that more luxurious glasses were being made in the same glasshouse.\n\nTrading\nGlass in its natural state is green from impurities. While the process of de-colourising it to create 'crystal' remained a secret outside the glassmaking centres of Venice and Altare, near Savona, Liguria, huge quantities of cristallo drinking glasses were exported to England and elsewhere. Only after Italian makers took their craft skills to The Netherlands and England were these countries able to satisfy their own demands for luxury glass.",
