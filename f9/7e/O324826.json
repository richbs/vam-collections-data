Mayer, using the chronicle of Ibn Ayas, identified him as a eunuch at the Mamluk court, whose career he reconstructed as follows:\n\nAH 873 (AD 1468/9) - appointed Chief of the Corps of Cup-bearers\nAH 879 (AD 1474) - appointed Vizier in succession to Yashbak al-Dawadar\nRabi' al-Awwal 882 (June or July 1477) - appointed Great Treasurer and Warden of the Princesses\nAH 884 (AD 1479-80) - Amir al-Hajj for the Pilgrimage to Mecca that year\nRabi' al-Akhir 889 (April or May 1484) - dismissed as Vizier\nRamadan 891 (September 1486) - exiled to Qus\nMuharram 894 (December 1488) - exiled to Sawakin\nShawwal 894 (August or September 1489) - died in Sawakin\n\nThus, the titulature used on the box shows that it was made between June 1477 and May 1484.\n\nThe blazon of Khushqadam shows a napkin in the upper field, a cup between two horns in the central field, and a cup in the lower field.\n\nAccording to Allan, food boxes of this type were made in stacking sets of two or three, with a lid with a central handle. The lid could also serve as a serving dish, when the handle served as a foot. The step in the base, the arrangement of the decoration and the slight mismatch between the shapes of the box and the lid recorded by Allan suggest that in this case the box was the middle element in a stacking set of three. The original attachments designed to keep the stack closed and for carrying it were probably made of another material and have been lost. The current hasp and hinges were added later, perhaps when the box and lid were adapted as a single-unit set. The decoration of these elements suggest that this was done in the late Ottoman period.",
