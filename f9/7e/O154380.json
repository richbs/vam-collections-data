If it has a precedence, it is in the glories of the Renaissance.  He seeks the essence of things in his life and his work.  This piece brings out his fascination with allegory and with myth and they are linked by him as he connects to past and present.  His work is drenched in meaning, a challenge and stimulus to the owner and user.  In his combination of precious and semi-precious materials, in his skills as a modeller and his technical virtuosity, he unites the crafts of jeweller and goldsmith.",
