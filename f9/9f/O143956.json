Often the backs and bottoms of ceramics were not covered with slip as these areas would not normally be visible. Here, you can see that the potter has applied slip only to the rim area which has carved and painted decoration. Look at the blotches of slip on the red ground. The potter has inadvertently left his fingerprints on this dish.\n\nSimilarly decorated ceramics were made in Pomarance, near Pisa in Tuscany. It seems likely that this dish too came from the same area.\n\nThe coat of arms in the centre of this dish (blue, three roses between an arched fess) have not been identified with any Renaissance Italian noble family. There was a family by the name of Baradat with holdings in Champagne who bore somewhat similar arms.",
