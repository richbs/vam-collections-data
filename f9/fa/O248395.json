Westwood was inspired by English tailoring and cutting for this collection, which included a number of notable hats such as a crown made from Harris tweed and this hat entitled 'John Bull'.\n\n 'John Bull', is a caricature figure who first appeared in 1712. He is often referred to as a national personification of England and is typically depicted wearing a shallow crowned top hat with curved brim.\n\nWestwood has exaggerated the proportions of this hat and the inside of the crown contains a black padded band in order to avoid the hat slipping down over the wearer's face. This hat was worn by a man, but was designed to be worn with both menswear and womenswear pieces.",
