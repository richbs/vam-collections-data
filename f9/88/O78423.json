The figure of a man holds a pointer against the dial.  Each time the key is turned in the lock, the engraved dials rotates and the pointer indicates a  number. The key-hole is concealed by the man's front leg, which operates on a pivot. When a button is pressed, the leg swings forward to reveal the keyhole. The door-bolt is released by tilting the man's hat.\n\nUse\nSuch a lock would have been fitted to the door of a private closet, where important business took place.\n\nInscription\nThe front of the lock is engraved with the verse:\n\nIf I had ye gift of tongue\nI would declare and do no wrong\nWho ye are ye come by stealth\nTo impare my Master's wealth.",
