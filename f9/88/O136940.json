Natural texture is created through the cross-peened top surface of the blade, the chamfered left edge and the five small pierced holes, reminiscent of breathing holes. There is an effortless transition between blade and handle, sinuous strands of sea weed grip the blade. The natural, dynamic curves are reinforced by the whip like wires of silver which coil from the finial. The smooth globular finial offsets the textured handle, recalling Art Nouveau forms. The piece is naturalistic, capturing the raw beauty of the ocean, enhanced by the distinctive style of the artist.",
