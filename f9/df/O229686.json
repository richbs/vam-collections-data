Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. Above all, they had to have the means for attaching a cord. Netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated being the katabori (shape carving), a three-dimensional carving, such as this one in the form of an emaciated dog on a pile of leaves.\n\nFrom the 18th century onwards, many more makers signed their netsukes. This example is signed Ranmei who was a pupil of Rantei of Kyoto. The portrayal of the dog lying on leaves reflects the influence of the artist Masatsugu's realistic style. Despite being from the Kyoto and Osaka schools their are some strong similarities in technique and craftsmanship between the two artists. \n\nDuring the Meiji period (1868-1912) netsuke began to loose their practical function as traditional Japanese dress was replaced by Western clothing. Artists such as Masatsugu and Ranmei would continue to produce netsuke, keeping the traditional craftsmanship alive.",
