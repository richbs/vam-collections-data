Subsequently, Jones became one of the few Britons to produce a substancial body of calotypes in Britain and abroad. His work stands out in the early development of photography because of his ability to fuse his technical skill with his training as a watercolourist.\n\nJones was a close friend and neighbour of  Kit Talbot, the owner of the recently built Margam Castle. Talbot, a wealthy landowner and industrialist may have commissioned the series of house portraits: prior to inheriting property of his own, Jones has been described as one of Talbot's 'satelites'. Jones had already photographed Margam Castle in March 1941, using the daguerreotype process. This image shows the south front, one of two terraced garden fronts.",

Talbot influenced the design, in particular he incorporated heraldic shields and carved faces.",
