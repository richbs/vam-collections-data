By 1550, they were using blue, turquoise, sage green, tones of mauve and purple, and a greenish black. These colours have been used here to depict a spray of flowers that rises from a small clump of leaves.\n\nIznik has given its name to some of the most accomplished ceramics produced in the Islamic Middle East. In the mid 15th century, potters there specialised in modest earthenware imitations of Chinese blue-and-white porcelain. But in the 1460s or 1470s, under the patronage of Sultan Mehmet the Conqueror, they began to manufacture bowls, dishes and other pieces of fritware that were elegant in shape and decoration, and often very large.",
