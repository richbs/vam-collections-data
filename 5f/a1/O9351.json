ISBN 1851773088.\nLike English artists' books, British studio pottery was actively collected by the Museum throughout the twentieth century, particularly through the efforts of the Circulation Department. William Murray, a deeply spiritual man, believed that pottery was the bridge between sculpture and painting. Like other potters and collectors of the 1920s and 1930s, Murray was enthralled by the revelations of the newly excavated Chinese ceramics, with their strong forms, plain but rich glazes, and subdued decoration (see cat. 108). The title of this piece, Wheel of Life, demonstrates Murray's belief in the cosmic dimension of pottery:\n\"\". . . the clay is formed on the wheel by opposing forces, it opens as an expanding spiral and so follows closely the evolving nature. . . . [T]he earth itself might almost be a vast potter's wheel and the potter's thumb on which is the spiral imprint, has then a deeper meaning, this spiral formation can be seen everywhere.\"\"\nMurray chose to exhibit in fine art galleries. As a result of their status as art objects, Murray's pots tended to be expensive. Although the Museum acquired twenty-one pieces during Murray's working life (c. 1920-39), only five of these were purchases by the Museum. The others were acquired as gifts from patrons. One piece that was purchased by the V&A cost just over \u00a320 - the highest price paid for a piece of studio pottery before World War II. The Wheel of Life vase, made in 1937, was purchased from a farewell exhibition in 1958, when Murray returned from Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) to clear out his studio. He had moved abroad and ceased potting in 1939. The piece was bought for \u00a394.50, a price not paid again for studio pots until the 1970s. Murray's recognised status as an \"artist\" rather than a craftsperson justified the expense.\n\nOLIVER WATSON",
