Robinson wrote of how he found the dish: '... in the course of unpacking and sorting all the Victoria and Albert Museum objects that had spent the war years in the cool and secure profundity of the Bradford-on-Avon quarries, I came across a rather large and heavy circular parcel wrapped in faded brown paper and tied with a dusty string. I unwrapped it and, to my great astonishment and delight, found that I had uncovered the enameled gold dish presented by the Fath 'Ali Shah to the East India Company -- over six pounds of solid gold, with beautiful painted enamel embellishments signed by Muhammad Ja'far and dated to 1818. When \"John Company\" was abolished after the Indian Mutiny in 1857, the dish had been transferred, along with the rest of the Company treasures to the Indian Section of what was then the South Kensington Museum, and not being Indian, it was left to hibernate there for nearly a century in its original wrappings.'\nB.W.
