This poster depicts Imam Husayn at the Battle of  Karbala in 680AD. \n\nThe majority of Iran\u2019s population are Shi'ia Muslims. The Shi\u2019ite sect began in the  650s,  when Ali, the son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad and Husayn\u2019s father  became Caliph (leader of the Muslim people). The supporters of Ali became known as  the Shiites, which means \"the followers of Ali\u201d. However Muhammad had not named  his successor and the years following his death were marked with rival claims to  power. In 680 the rival Umayyad Caliph killed Husayn, along with most of his male  family and followers at the Battle of Karbala in Iraq. Shi'ites consider Husayn a martyr  and mark his death every year during the month of Muharram.\n\nIn this poster Husayn is shown proudly riding out on his horse to face the rival army. In his hand he is holding the green standard of the Prophet's family. In this way the viewer is reminded of Husayn's holy lineage. Posters like this are designed to have an  emotional impact on the viewer and remind Shi'ites of Husayn's martydom.",
