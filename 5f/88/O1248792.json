It is constructed with two strips of wood that make a noise when the stick is shaken and they strike each other. The figures were bought in 1937 were made by the master puppet maker Arthur Quisto (1882-1960), except the two boxers and the ghost, whose maker is not known.\n\nMr Punch was first recorded in England in 1662 by the famous diarist Samuel Pepys when he saw him as a marionette, operated in Covent Garden by the Italian puppet showman Signor Bologna. Pulchinella, as he was then called, was presented within a tent rather than in the type of booth we know today. Pepys brought his wife to see the show two weeks later and that October the same show was performed at Whitehall for the King. \n\nIn Gordon Bavister's Punch and Judy show Mr. Punch uses his slapstick to hit Judy's hat when Joey hides underneath it, when knocking Judy and the Policeman out, when fighting with Joey, and with the white boxer. Later Joey and the Doctor both use a slapstick to hit Mr. Punch.",
