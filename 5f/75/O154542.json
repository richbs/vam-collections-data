Offset rows of star-like rosettes which touch at the diagonal corners. There are two variations, one type per row. The first has eight tear-shaped petals around a light red rosette with a purple centre. The petals have a white flame-like edge. The second has an eight arch-like petals around a light red rosette with a purple centre. The petals have a solid white border. In between these motifs is a small light red rosette on a purple star within a light red circle. Other spaces are filled with light red flower heads. Some have small green leaves. At the lower end there is a 1 cm deep undecorated band of metal thread weft-faced plain weave.\n\nThere are the remains of red basting stitches where a lining or backing may have once been attached and there is evidence of pink stitches along all four sides.",
