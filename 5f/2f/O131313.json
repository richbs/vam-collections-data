He trained as a lawyer until a sculptor friend convinced him that he should become an artist. Anrep moved to Paris to study art, and eventually specialised in mosaic making. Through the painter Henry Lamb, he became friends with Duncan Grant and Augustus John, through whom he gained access to the artistic and intellectual avant-garde of the Bloomsbury Group. In 1912 Roger Fry asked Anrep to choose Russian pictures for the <i>Second Post-Impressionist Exhibition</i>at the Grafton Galleries in London, and Anrep also contributed to the catalogue. \n\nFrom 1918 Anrep lived in London and began to work as a mosaicist. As a private commission for Augustus John in 1919 he created a large mantelpiece depicting the artist with his wife, mistresses and children (now in the V&A). However, Anrep's most significant contributions to art in Britain were public commissions: the mosaics he made for the floor of the octagonal gallery beneath the rotunda in Tate Britain, and those he created for the National Gallery. In the National Gallery mosaics he portrayed his friends, many of them well-known writers and artists of the Bloomsbury Group. Among the figures of 'The Modern Virtues' (one of four sections of Anrep's mosaic scheme) is Maud Russell, the subject of the present portrait, and also the artist's mistress. This portrait, bearing the title 'folly', commemorates her act of financing the mosaics. \n\nMaud Russell (1891-1981) was a well-known society hostess and collector; her husband, Gilbert Russell, was a merchant banker. As well as sitting for Anrep, she was painted by William Nicholson, William Orpen and Ambrose McEvoy, and in 1937 commissioned portrait drawings from Henri Matisse. The Russells bought Mottisfont Abbey in Hampshire (now National Trust) in 1934, and four years later commissioned the young artist Rex Whistler to paint a magnificent <i>trompe-l'oeil</i>mural in the drawing room. \n\nAnrep's informal portrait of Maud Russell, showing her sitting up in bed and reading letters, was presumably painted around 1930, and was presumably a private commission from the sitter. \n\nAnrep died in June 1969 at Maud Russell's London home in Hyde Park Gardens. In 1970 Russell presented to the V&A a large number of designs and cartoons for mosaics from the artist's estate (E.661-1970 to E.693-1970). \n\nAfter Russell's death in 1981, works from her collection of modern British and Continental pictures were included in a sale at Sotheby's. However, along with Anrep's large design, made in 1945, for the mosaic pavement on the landing at the entrance to the National Gallery (E.14-1983), Russell bequeathed the present oil painting to the V&A.",
