After his initial training in drawing and painting at Hammersmith he developed a passionate interest in etching. He claims to be largely self-taught in printmaking but did a postgraduate degree in printmaking at the Slade in 1971-2. From the beginning he focused on mezzotint which has been the favoured medium for his own prints ever since. This is one of four prints in the V&A collection which demonstrate his mastery of the mezzotint medium, with rich varieties and subtleties of tone. They are also characteristic of his interest in focusing on detail \u2013 each is a close-up of a knot or fastening, the contrasting materials \u2013 wood, metal, rope, canvas, leather etc \u2013 offering him the challenge of conveying different textures.",
