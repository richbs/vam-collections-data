It shows the city of Danzig, famous for producing amber and distributing corn.  It is shown in a perspective.  The city is in the background whilst typical Polish characters dominate the foreground.  The map has a key to refer to notable buildings in the town and whilst it is certainly topographical it was not meant to be used to guide oneself around the town as we would use a map today.  It\u2019s main function was to satisfy the armchair traveller, to educate people and to entertain them with lively scenes from across Europe.",
