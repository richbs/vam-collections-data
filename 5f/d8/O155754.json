The main hexagonal field is decorated with connecting 8-pointed stars in satin stitch broken on each side by a small metallic cruciform motif as in [A], which in four instances is surrounded by a pulled thread grid in a toothed hexagon shape.  In the centre is a large octagon formed of a very finely worked pulled thread grid [now with loose ends], edged with small repeat of double lozenges, alternately in white or metal thread. The large octagon leads into the central octagon of pulled thread work in a different patterning. The central space itself has an outer edging of:\n[a] a row of small pulled thread lozenges\n[b] a repeating series of 2 pulled thread lozenges\n[c] as [a]\nThere are bands of needleweaving within this design.\nCotton thread: Z-spun\nEmbroidery Thread: white silk, 2S\nMetal Thread: silver strip close S-wound on a yellow silk core and also on a light orange silk core.",
