Barnor first moved to London in 1959, and his reportage of the capital during the 1960s records the emergence of a modern, multicultural city. The outfits worn by two wedding guests combine Western and traditional West African fashions into a global 1960s style. The leafy backdrop and telephone box locate this multicultural scene on British streets. \n\nThe V&amp;A acquired five photographs by James Barnor as part of the Staying Power project. Staying Power is a five year partnership between the V&amp;A and Black Cultural Archives. The project aims to explore black British experience from the 1950s to the 1990s through photographs acquired by the V&amp;A and oral histories conducted by Black Cultural Archives.",
