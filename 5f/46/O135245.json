Museum has a pencil sketch of a more distant view, \"No. 2 Ouse bridge, July 5, 1803,\" by J. S. Cotman. In the diary kept by Mrs. Cholmley of Brandsby Hall, near York, is the entry: \"July 7, 1803. Mr. Munn and Mr. Cotman came.\" This beautiful drawing was probably done in London after Cotman's return from Yorkshire from a penhcil drawing made on the spot (communicated by Mr. S. L. Kitson). The drawing was inherited by the testatrix from her mother, Mrs. Rosetta d'Arblay Wood, who inherited it from her father, Archdeacon Charles Parr Burney.",
