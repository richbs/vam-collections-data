He specialised in looking at circus tents with an architect's eye and produced a series of Tentmaster prints after his own drawings. This was reproduced in the Tentmaster Series number 6.\n\nThe artist noted the technical details of Chipperfield's Circus World Big Top on this painting. It was made by the tentmakers Canobbio in Milan, Italy, and had a seating capacity of about 1,200.  It has four lattice King poles, 14 metres high, each in two sections, with 28 quarter poles painted red. The top was 35 metres in diameter in six sections, two centres, four quarters and a lattice ridge bar. The tent was first used as a secondary tent at the Mante Carlo International Circus Festival as a secondary tent in 1976, 1977 and 1978. It was sold to Jimmy Chipperfield's Circus World in 1980 and was first used by him in the UK at Andover in March 1980.  It was bought by Gandey's Circus in 1983.",
