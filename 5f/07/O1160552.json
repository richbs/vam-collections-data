Meccano was seen as an educational toy, useful to teach children about mechanics and engineering. The component parts, including those of this motor, were extremely well-made and engineered. Meccano was a relatively high-priced toy, and was therefore most popular with wealthier families. This particular example was bought for the donor's father as a young boy, when he was about eight years old.",

Motors, which were used to power models made using the system, were first produced in 1914. This particular type would have been used to make larger models move. The kits and accessories, such as this motor, would have been relatively expensive at the time, and bought mostly by more affluent families.",
