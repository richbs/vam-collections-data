This model represents George Washington, who was the first President of the United States. Calderini recorded that Marochetti produced a colossal equestrian monument to Washington for the 1855 New York Exhibition, which was destroyed by fire. A related small-scale bronze, a reduction of the New York equestrian figure of Washington by Marochetti, was said to be located in the Castello Marochetti at Vaux: it was later in the Ch\u00e2teau de Cheverny in the possession of the Comtesse de Vibraye, a distant relative of Marochetti. This model does not seem to be related to the equestrian monument.\n\nBaron Carlo Marochetti (1805-1867) was born in Turin. He initially studied in Paris, where he was resident, intermittently returning to Italy between 1822 and 1827. Following the 1848 Revolution, Marochetti settled in England, where he produced a number of public monuments and became a favourite of Royalty, producing the effigies of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert for Frogmore, Windsor.",
