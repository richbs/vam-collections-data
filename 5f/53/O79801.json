The main purpose of all these acquisitions was to help improve the quality of design among British artisans.\n\nThis earring was described as \u2018modern Turkish, from Tripoly\u2019, when it was acquired.  The Tripoli in question must be the Libyan city as it is typical of the kind of jewellery worn there in the 19th century, and carries numerous silver marks in use in the Tripoli region.  At that time the Ottoman Empire extended along much of the North African coast, although its authority was often only nominal, as in Egypt.",
