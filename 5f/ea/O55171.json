Pugin for Charles Scarisbrick of Scarisbrick Hall, Lancashire in about 1838. Pugin made alterations and additions to Scarisbrick Hall, a sixteenth-century manor house, between  1836 and 1845.  It was his first independent architectural commission.\n\nThe design of the chair is very similar to one illustrated by Pugin in his book Gothic Furniture in the Style of the 15th Century, published in 1835.  Although the design is based on medieval chairs illustrated in manuscripts, those earlier examples would not have been upholstered.  Despite this difference, the relatively simple style of this chair marks Pugin\u2019s move away from the decorative and fanciful Gothic of the Regency period, towards a correct and more direct use of medieval sources.\n\nThe V&A also owns an armchair (Circ.237-1951) from the Scarisbrick set.",

            "history_note": "One of a set of dining chairs and armchairs designed by A.W.N. Pugin for Charles Scarisbrick of Scarisbrick Hall, Lancashire in about 1838. Pugin worked for Charles Scarisbrick between 1836 and 1845, making major alterations and additions to Scarisbrick Hall, the sixteenth century manor house which had already been extensively altered by Thomas Rickman between 1813 and 1816. Edward Hull, a furniture dealer of 55 St. Martin's Lane and 109 Wardour Street, London, supplied furniture for Scarisbrick but the surviving accounts are not sufficiently detailed to identify these dining chairs. Two armchairs and six chairs were sold by Sir Everard Scarisbrick at Philips Son and Neale, London, 13th August 1951 lot 59. One amchair and this chair were purchased by the Museum. The rest of the set was bought by the Ministry of Works, possibly for use in the Houses of Parliament.\n\nHistorical significance: One of a set of chairs made for Scarisbrick Hall in Lancashire, Pugin's first important architectural commission. This is a variation of a design published by Pugin in <font -u>Gothic Furniture in the Style of the 15th Century</font> (1835). It was based upon medieval examples illustrated in manuscripts. As such, it represents Pugin's move away from the decorative and fanciful Gothic of the Regency period towards a correct and more honest use of sources. The manufacturer is not known. It is even possible that the chairs were made in North Germany, for the Wardour Street antique dealer John Coleman Issacs had furniture of this type made there from designs in Pugin's book and imported into England via Hamburg. Pugin was closely involved at this time with the London antique trade, buying and selling through the dealer Edward Hull, whose premises were also in Wardour Street. In 1834 Pugin designed a range of furniture for Hull, and at Pugin's suggestion Charles Scarisbrick patronized these dealers through the late 1830s and into the 1840s.",
