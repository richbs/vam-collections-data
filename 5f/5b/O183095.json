Right-angles and parallel lines give way to converging or diverging lines and variable angles, and so spatial illusion also becomes more complex. By 1950  when he came to make a series of images titled 'Transformations', some of the images began to look like diagrams of stellar explosions. \n\nAbout this time also he began making prints  from mechanically engraved plastic or metal and sometimes as blind relief intaglios. By using a mechanical means of engraving his intention was to make the line as impersonal and therefore, as purely functional, as possible, By printing others blind, the line itself is partialy dematerialised, its own visibility rendered ambivalent.",
