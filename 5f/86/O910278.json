The prints, popular amongst the newly-affluent in Holland, probably depict costumes inspired by French clothing; France was the leader in Fashion during this period. The clothes are very elaborate and represent the high-end of fashion, aspirational rather than everyday. The man wears the fuller silhouetted coat that was worn in the 1600s. His wide brimmed hat is decorated with feathers and he wears a curled wig. Beribbond breeches maintain the wide silhouette down to his heeled boots. Carrying a sword was a sign of a gentleman, not always a soldier. This combination presents him as a man of wealth with the resources to buy such materials and the lifestyle that allows the wearing expensive clothes rather than have to wear practical clothes for work. His young black attendant wears what is probably a household livery: a coat, cravat and wide breeches \u2013 albeit in a much plainer style to the man in the foreground.",
