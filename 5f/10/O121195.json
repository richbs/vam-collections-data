He was one of the great couturiers of his age, and influenced many future designers.  Christian Dior himself liked to call Balenciaga 'the master of us all', and once commented upon seeing a Balenciaga suit - \"only Balenciaga would be capable of producing such perfection\".\n\nFor day-wear Balenciaga's style was one of classic simplicity, placing great emphasis on quality textiles, and subtle cut and tailoring.  He liked bold materials and heavy cloths, some of which were made especially for him, like the famous 'gazar' and 'zagar' silks.  For evening wear, Balenciaga's designs could be flamboyant and richly decorated, often with rich embroidery .\n\nThis hat is an example of Balenciaga's millinery designs from the early 1960s; probably 1962.  It is a sculptural piece typical of Balenciaga's style.  It would have been worn with day wear such as tailored suits and tailored sculptural coats.  Balenciaga would often team over-size or flamboyantly constructed hats with the linear tailoring of his day wear.\n\nBalenciaga retired in 1968.",
