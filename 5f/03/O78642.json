The tankard was used for drinking beer. During February 1860 it was reported that 71 pints of stout and 80 gallons of draught ale had been sold, but that no visitors had been removed from the museum for drunken behaviour.\n\nDesign & Designer\nThe tankard was designed by the artist Alfred Stevens. The influential sculptor, painter, designer and lecturersupplied designs to several manufacturers, including the iron founders Henry E. Hoole & Co., the Coalbrookdale Iron Company and the ceramic firm Minton & Co. The utilitarian cylindrical shape of the tankard body has been relieved by decorative details that look back to historic models. The ornate handle was inspired by Renaissance designs and the ball feet were first used on Russian, German and Scandinavian silver of the 17th century. The tankard design appears in the Elkington pattern books as pattern 11435 and is dated May 1868. The engraved crown and 'V&AM' must date from 1899, when the Museum was renamed.\n\nThe Manufacturer\nElkington & Co., who made this tankard, became the largest and most successful silversmithing business in England in the 19th century. They supplied the top end of the domestic market as well as the emerging hotel, restaurant and travel trade. The firm was founded in Birmingham by George Richard Elkington (1801-1865) and his cousin Henry Elkington (about 1810-1852), who, with the capital from other business partners, exploited the development of the new manufacturing processes of electroplating (depositing a coat of silver on a base metal by the action of an electric current), electrogilding (gilding by use of electricity) and electrotyping (a form of electronic casting to form a whole object). By marketing electroplate as a cheaper substitute for silver and by selling the patents for all the new techniques, the Elkingtons revolutionised the silver and plating trades throughout the world.",
