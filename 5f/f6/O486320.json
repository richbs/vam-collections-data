As well as imitating the swaying gait caused by bound feet it also made them tower over the diminutive Chinese: \"\u2026the shoes stand upon a sole of four or six inches (10-15cm) in height or even more. These soles, which consist of a wooden frame upon which white cotton cloth is stretched, are quite thin from the toe and heel to about the centre of the foot, when they curve abruptly downwards, forming a base of  2 or 3 inches square (5-8cm). In use they are exceedingly inconvenient, but\u2026.they show the well-to-do position of the wearer. The Manchus are\u2026a taller\u2026race than the Chinese, and the artificial increase to the height afforded by these shoes gives them at time almost startling proportions.\" (Garrett, 135-137)",
