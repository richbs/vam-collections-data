It emphasises the straight lines of hte chair frame, which forms a contrast with the curve of the seat. The rigid lacquer frame, with chromed-steel fittings and padded leather seat, were distinctively Modern. Influenced by Mies van der Rohe's chrome-plated metal of chair of 1927, which was something of a revelation with its cantilvered floating seaet, Gray was one of the first designers to use chrome-plated metal.\n\nAs a practising architect, Gray was interested in developing the ideal Minimal Dwelling and was concerned that furniture should be flexible and convenient for the small urban home. As such, the 'Transat' could easily be folded and stored out of the way when not in use.",
