            "public_access_description": "This limewood and lancewood panel is carved by the sculptor Grinling Gibbons in ca. 1690-1710. The panel was a decorative object, designed to be displayed on a wall. In this respect, it was like the famous panel in the Pitti Palace, Florence, which was made by Gibbons as a diplomatic gift from Charles II to Cosimo de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. Although the subject is biblical, it may well have been intended for a secular context, rather than as a devotional piece. No record has survived of the commission for this piece. It seems to have remained in the artist's possession and was probably included in the sale of his effects that took place shortly after his death in 1722. It may have been bought at the sale by James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos, for his house at Cannons, Middlesex. The panel shows the Stoning of St Stephen, the first Christian martyr. He was put to death after arousing the wrath of the legislative council in Jerusalem by his sermon arguing for the divinity of Christ (Acts of the Apostles 7: 2-56). Stephen was one of the first seven deacons appointed by the Apostles, and is here shown in simple robes, in contrast with the classical dress of those stoning him. He is looking up to Heaven at a vision of Christ.\n\nGrinling Gibbons (1648-1721) was born in Holland and probably studied under Artus Quellinus I (1609-1668) before he settled in England around 1667. Gibbon's workshop is most celebrated for the virtuoso wood carvings and reliefs produced for royal and aristocratic patrons, such as the work carried out at Hampton Court, Windsor Castle and Petworth House, Sussex. His workshop also produced statuary and church monuments in stone and marble and statues cast in bronze.",

London: Penguin Books, 1988. pp. 116-117, fig.74, p.442, n.28. (Second edition, revised by John Physick)\nWhinney suggests that the Stoning of Saint Stephen may be an early work, since Vertue says that it was made at Deptford and Gibbons moved to Bow Street, Covent Garden in 1677. However, other sources suggest that Vertue may have confused this work with Gibbons' Crucifixion after Tintoretto, so the dating is not necessarily valid.\nMolesworth, Hender Delves. <u>Sculpture in England.

Circa 1734 Vertue (Walpole Society XXVI.34) after confusing it with a Crucifixion ..., records that Gbbons kept his \"St. Stephen\" at his house in Bow Steet, Covent Garden in his gallery of pictures. \"The Duke of Chandos bought it and has it at Cannons, at Edgworth. Vertue (ibid. XXII.9) records the sale of Gibbons's effects, 15 Nov. 1722. Perhaps the Duke acqired the carving from that sale, since he had employed Gibbons in the Monument Room at Whitchurch not long before.\n\"St. Stephen\" was bought at the Cannons Sale, c.1748, by a Mr. Gore of Bush Hill Park, Edmonton (or Enfield). In 1794 Lysons (Environs II, 169) recorded the carving at Bush Hill in W. Mellish's possession. See too Beauties of England and Wales, XIV.708. In 1839 Mr. Rebow, a nephew of Mellish, inherited the carving and took it to Wivenhoe Park, Essex. He died in 1870; his son, Hector Gurdon-Rebow, had the carving at Wivenhoe in 1875 (Murray, Essex Guide, 1875, p.56) ...'\nJenkins, S. <u>Portrait of a Patron.

It was at the Duke's seat, Canons in Middlesex, until the sale following its demolition in 1747, when it was bought by a Mr Gore; passing by descent through his family until 1839, it was in turn aquired by a Mr Rebouw and taken to Wivenhoe Park near Colchester. It entered the museum in 1898.\n\nHistorical significance: One of the most renowned sculptors in England during the second half of the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, Grinling Gibbons is famous for his intricate and fluent woodcarving, of which this piece is an outstanding example. The subject is the stoning to death of the first Christian martyr, the scene shown in the centre foreground, but perhaps more dominant is the grand Italianate building rising up behind. Many of the diminutive figures are in classical poses and groupings, and although Gibbons never went to Rome himself, such elements show that he was familiar with both High Renaissance Painting and antique sculpture.",
