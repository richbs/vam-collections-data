The body has been chased in a similar manner between raised ornamental bands and stamped circles. The reversed domed section to the top of the body is embossed with fluting, flowers and panels of raised beading. The saltcellar is plain but has been engraved with fruit and strapwork. The domed cover has a similarly engraved border and a wide flange that has been stamped with egg-and-dart ornament. This is embossed in the same manner as the foot and has a finial with three applied S-scroll brackets, surmounted by the figure of a warrior holding a spear and shield.",

The container used to hold it, the standing salt, thus gained social importance as well as providing a practical function. The standing salt was placed upon the table as a decorative centre piece. The surface of this particular example is decorated with stamped, chased and embossed decoration. It is surmounted by a warrior figure that holds a spear and a shield.\n\nFor those who could afford such a luxury, salt cellars (often referred to as salts) were the most common household item after spoons and cups. These salts also carried symbolic meaning, and royal goldsmiths' accounts show that they were purchased as christening gifts for the children of courtiers. The inclusion of salts in lists of heirloom plate also demonstrates that these were considered to be of relative personal significance.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",

The rarity of the commodity resulted in its container gaining social importance and being of a size much larger than actually needed for the salt it contained. This particular salt is known as a drum salt and appeared during the middle of the 16th century, along with the sqaure-section pedestal salt. By the end of the 16th century, the bell salt was far more popular. Nevertheless, the standing salt prevailed in traditional institutions, such as Oxford and Cambridge colleges and London livery guilds, where the ceremonial function of dining continued.",
