The walls and three-dimensional pilasters that extend from are painted in a rainbow of warm colours in red, orange and yellow. Indigo and navy lattice-work wall designs are painted over the warm background. A pair of doors are located on the left hand side behind with a freestanding column in the forefront. Two waist-height semi-circular extensions from the wall serve as stands for carved stone containers that hold flower arrangements. Wall paintings extend from the top of the walls, along the bottom of a curved ceiling, of the indigo and navy lattice-work and accompanied with depictions of multicolor birds and flowers. The ceiling is painted in a blue wash. Luminous hardwood floors make up the ground of the room where reflections and shadows of the walls' decorations are visible.",
