Beneath these are two dragons facing the centre each pursuing a sacred pearl. All the dragons are five-clawed. Scattered around the dragons are a few cloud bands and bats. \n\nBelow the dragons is the three-peaked mountain amid waves in which are a few miscellaneous symbols such as the sceptre and swastika. Below this is a very broad (16 inches (40.6 cm)) striped border representing deep water.\n\nThe robe is side-fastening (with five gilt buttons), and has slits at the front and back. It has long and tight sleeves with horse-hoof cuffs. There is no decoration on the forearms. On the neck border and cuffs are dragons, clouds and waves on a smaller scale than on the main body of the robe. Around the neck and halfway down the fastening on the right hand side is a border some 4 inches (10.2 cm) wide which is edged with black silk braid.\n\nThe robe is lined with plain weave mid blue hemp (or linen). \n\nThe quality of the silk is very inferior to that normally found on dragon robes; there are some very apparent weaving faults and it is rather coarsely woven. There is also a very modern (mechanically woven) and common black braid used in places as trim. The gilt buttons are unusually light.",
