Badges and postcards printed with the statement 'everything is interesting' (also the title of the exhibition) were circulated around Birmingham; they were on sale at the gallery but also distributed through letter-drops and mailings. \n\nMark saw these anonymous statements as small works of art feeding into the fabric of life in the city, circulating her message by an ephemeral low-key strategy characteristic of her focus on the minutiae of everyday life. By disseminating the idea way beyond the circles of the initiated and those who visited the gallery the badges reached out to an unknown and random audience.",
