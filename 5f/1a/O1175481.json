The design is not signed or dated but was probably created by Comelli in circa 1912. It shows a full length image of a woman dressed in an eighteenth century inspired dress. The bodice has elbow length sleeves striped in white and pink and white puffed undersleeves. It also has a dark red, front lacing panel, and a wide, white fichu around the low neckline to which a bunch of red, pansy link flowers are pinned. The bodice also has a wide, white and pink striped skirt gathered into a 'panier' style silohuette above the close fitting pink and white striped underskirt. This pink and white underskirt forms the first layer of an increasingly narrow succession of tiered underskirts each of which is a formed of tightly pleated white fabric and has with a narrow pale pink border. She is shown carrying a stylised shepherd's crook with a spray of red flowers pinned below the horn handle and wears a tilted wide brimmed white hat with a black band around the brim and a further spray of red flowers pinned beneath at the right of her face.",
