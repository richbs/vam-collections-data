The switch mechanism is contained within and is operated by a plain bakelite rod which passes through the middle.  The flex emerges from the side of the shaft and is covered in a knitted cotton sleeve, terminating with a standard, European two pin plug.  Although this type of flex is commensurate with what would have been originally supplied, its good condition suggests that it is a fairly recent replacement.  The top of the base is surmounted by a simple convex moulding through which rises a narrow, cylindrical shaft which is turn surmounted by a short sleeve of slightly greater diameter.  This sleeve is encircled by a simple moulding which is a circular disc with a milled edge and is surmounted by a short cylinder which provides the inner surport for the armature, supporting the shade.  The rim at the base of this cylinder is a plain convex moulding with a milled edge.  The socket for the bulb is a plain brass sleeve with an internal screw thread.  A circular china insualtor with a flared wall sits in the top.  The shade consists of three, white, opalescent glass sections supported on a cast, brass armature which sits on a cylindrical, nickel plated sleeve that fits snugly over the top of the stem.  The armature consists of three branches which flare outwards with brackets to hold the middle shade and then return, looping inwards to support a circular, aluminium platform with a flared rim which supports the top shade.  The shade is clamped to the support by a another circular plate, nickel plated, which is retained by a threaded, knurled knop.  The lowest of the three shades on the lower rim of the armature.  The shades are of milk glass with a glazed, outer surface andf a matt finish for the interior.  The lowest of the three is a cylinder, the middle a flared sector and the top, a large circular plate.",
