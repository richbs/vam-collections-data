Note: researchers may use the terms applique and tambour when searching for this category of textile even though they are incorrect.\nRed ground with a large but incomplete lobed 'mihrab' arch with a white ground edged in dark blue with a 2-plied cord in white and pink S-twisted silk.  The white arch form is multi-pieced and then over embroidered with two thick meandering stems in light green chain stitch, each carrying leaves in light green, black or mid-blue and multi-coloured exotic blossoms and buds forming a clear and bold design. There are two multi-coloured buds [one incomplete]. The red ground carries a simple white floral meander at both sides holding smaller, less complicated flowers, buds and leaves, while in the uppermost section a trumpet flower either side in white, 'gold' and black, alongside small trefoil buds in blue and white are carried on white curving stems [embroidered].  Two green parakeets on this stem confront each other at the apex of the arch in two shades of green.\n\nEmbroidery thread: 2S; yellow, red[ faded to pink], white, black, grey, cream, light blue, blue, pink, red, beige and light green.\nInserts: yellow, two mid-blues, dark blue, light brown, white, two shades of light green, black, red, purple and pink.\n\nSee also 858-1892 which is probably the lower part of this panel. A section of about 22 cm would complete the panel. \n\nA similar panel is incorporated into an early 19th century tent sold at Sotheby's in April 1991 and now in a private collection.
