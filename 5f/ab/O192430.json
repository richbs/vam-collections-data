However the awkward flatness of the carving at the back, and the bland style throughout suggest this may well be a much later work, inspired by the seventeenth-century source.  It could be South Netherlandish or perhaps French and be possibly from ca. 1850.",

However the awkward flatness of the carving at the back, and the bland style throughout suggest this may well be a much later work, inspired by the seventeenth-century source.  It could be South Netherlandish or perhaps French.\nBought from David Peel & Co. Ltd., London, for \u00a31,500 (Departmental Fund), in 1977.",
