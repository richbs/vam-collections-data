It shows his taste in furnishings and pictures, and is a rare opportunity to see how a young man of progressive tastes lived in 1827-1829. Watercolours showing modest interiors of this kind are rare enough, but this one is dated and the exact location given. Even if it was anonymous, it would still be an important document in the history of British interior design.",
