            "public_access_description": "Kean, thought of in his time as the greatest ever actor, was also a controversial and somewhat eccentric figure. Famous for his sincere interpretations of Shakespeare on the London stage, his performance as Shylock at Drury Lane in 1814 roused the audience\u2019s fervour and his reputation exploded.  He garnered world-wide acclaim, playing in New York and Canada in the 1820s. Accusations of adultery, however, and a growing dependence on alcohol and stimulants, meant his decline on the London stage was inevitable.\n\nIn an attempt to avoid the controversy erupting in England over his affair, he embarked on a second tour of North America in 1825. During a visit to Qu\u00e9bec, he was introduced to four Huron chiefs, to whom he presented each with a medal. In return they adopted him into their tribe, giving him the name Alanienouidet. Enormously proud of this honour, Kean would often receive his friends dressed in his Huron costume, and had his portrait painted in it, of which this is a print. Dr Francis, a colleague of Kean\u2019s, recalled how he was once summoned to meet with someone he was told was an Indian chief in a New York hotel:\n\u201cFull dressed, with skins tagged loosely about his person, a broad collar of bear-skin over his shoulders, his leggings, with many beads; his head decked with the war-eagle\u2019s plumes, behind which flowed massive black locks of dishevelled horse hair\u2026 He descended his throne and rapidly approached me. His eye was meteoric and fearful, like the furnace of a Cyclops. He vociferously exclaimed, Alantenaida!\u201d",
