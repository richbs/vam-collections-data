Floud, 'The wallpaper designs of William Morris', <i>Penrose's Annual</i>, 1960, 54, pp.41-5; F/ Clark, <i>William Morris wallpapers and chintzes</i>, 1974; C.C. Oman and J. Hamilton, <i>Wallpapers a history and illustrated catalogue of the collection in the Victoria and Albert Museum</i>, 1982, no.1065\n\nThis design and that described in cat.no.1.10.c are from volume 1 of two wallpaper pattern books containing original printed samples (25 and 27 on 168 sheets, including different colour-ways) collected together by William Morris. The numbers inscribed after the titles of the patterns are taken from Morris &amp; Co.'s log books.\n\n'Willow' is characteristic of the group of nine wallpapers which Morris designed during the period 1872-1876, exhibiting an apparently spontaneous naturalism in which the intricate curves and interlacing of the foliage mirror the conformation of natural growth. This disguises the skill with which Morris imposes on the design a complex repeating pattern, as he seeks 'to mask the construction of our patterns enough to prevent people from counting repeats, while we lull their curiousity to trace it out'. (W.M., <i>Some hints on pattern-designing</i>, 1881).'",
