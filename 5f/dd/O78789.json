It would have been relatively expensive to buy. Hindley & Sons' clientele could be broadly defined as well-to-do. In an article in Studies in the Decorative Arts (1998) Laura Microulis describes an analysis of 737 orders which showed that approximately 70 per cent had come from the gentry or the middle class.\n\nPart of the stock of Hindley's, this cotton was printed for them by outside contract printers.  The leading firm at this time was Thomas Clarkson of Bannister Hall, Lancashire, which was probably responsible for printing this example. Hindley's (also known as Charles Hindley, C. Hindley & Sons, and Hindley & Wilkinson)  was founded by Charles Hindley in Berners Street, London,  in 1817.  The firm became one of the leading full-service house furnishers, and in 1844 expanded with the purchase of the Miles and Edwards (founded in 1822), which specialised in the sale of textile furnishings. It then moved to 134 Oxford Street, where the principle department was the 'Chintz Room', which displayed specimens of chairs and sofas covered with printed furnishings for clients to examine before placing their orders.",
