Dozens- probably hundreds- of silversmiths have learned anti- and synclastic raising in workshops he has given all over the country. The simple form he has created is very powerful in its expression. The stark directness of this server seems to relate to a very Scandinavian approach to design, in which the functional gives way to the sculptural if there is an aesthetic advantage to be gained. It is part of the free-form movement begun in the 1950s that combined innovative boldness with conservative tradition. Seppa has handled this brief with characteristic clarity and control, creating organic references through abstract statement.",
