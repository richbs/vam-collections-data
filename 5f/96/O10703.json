The shields run down the centre of the band with a pattern of acorns, oak leaves, strawberries, and other flowers down the sides. The lace is worked in light and darker brown hair with the pattern outlined with buttonhole stitches over a thicker hair, possibly horsehair.",

They are usually in the shape of a narrow band, like this. One example has loops at the ends, suggesting that it was meant to be fastened around something. It seems most likely that such pieces were worn around the wrist, as a bracelet.\n\nA reference in the English poet John Donne\u2019s poem \u2018The Relique\u2019, written in the early 17th century, suggests that bracelets worked in hair were given and worn as love tokens:\n\nWhen my grave is broke up againe\nSome second ghest to entertaine ...\nAnd he that digs it, spies\nA bracelet of bright haire about the bone,\nWill he not let us alone\nAnd thinke that there a loving couple lies ...\n\nThis piece of lace is worked in light and darker brown hair, which is probably human. The pattern has been outlined with a thicker hair, which may be horsehair.",
