            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nThis vase is a typical example of shellwork ornament from the late 18th century.  The flowers are made from naturally coloured sea shells held together by wires.  Wire and string form the 'stems', and these are stuck into a wooden vase, also decorated with shells.  The vase was displayed on a mantlepiece underneath a glass dome at the Bonnell family home, Pelling Place, Old Windsor, Berkshire.  It is said to have been one of a pair, the second being presented to Queen Adelaide when she breakfasted with the Bonnell family at their home.  However, a second vase has not been traced.\n\nSocial Class\nShellwork was particularly popular with middle- and upper-class ladies of fashion, who could afford the often expensive materials.  They also had the leisure time to devote to such artistic pursuits, developing the skills required to make complex ornaments, to decorate fernery grottoes attached to the house and small domestic objects, such as boxes, tea caddies and tables.\n\nMaterials & Making\nShells were being imported into Britain in large quantities in the late 18th century, and could be bought from specialist shops such as 'Mr Castle's Grotto' in London.  Other materials, such as wooden vases and basket shapes, were supplied by cabinet-makers.  It was usual for ladies to store their shells in partitioned wooden boxes.  This was a practical way of organising colours and varieties ready for use.  The small compartments were often designed in geometric patterns, which, when filled with shells, gave the box a decorative quality of its own.",
