As well as being crucial records of the history of the V&amp;A, and an important element within the National Art Library's visual encyclopaedia, these photographs are also significant artefacts in the history of the art of photography.\n\nThe ceramic staircase was designed by Frank Moody, a decorative artist who played a key role in the embellishment of the Museum. The first two flights of stairs were totally encased in 'Della Robbia' ware and mosaic, while the ceilings, domes, panels and spandrels were decorated with vitrified ceramic painting.",
