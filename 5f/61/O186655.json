The Abruzzi is a remote and mountainous area of central Italy, and traditional jewellery survived there longer than in many other parts of the country.  It was formerly part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, and the jewellery is often different from that found elsewhere in northern and central Italy, but this earring is not distinctive.  It is set with white pastes, imitating the diamonds worn with aristocratic jewellery.  The central section of the pendant drop would originally have swung freely, but it has been soldered in place at top and bottom. \n\nIt was bought as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
