Back in Antwerp in 1608 to seek work prospects on the eve of the Twelve-year Truce with Spain (1609-21), he benefited from the stimulating government and patronage of Archdukes Albert and Isabella.",

London, 1973, pp. 249-250, cat. no. 308\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\nSir Peter Paul RUBENS (1577-1640) \nFlemish (Antwerp) School \nBorn in Siegen, Westphalia, of an Antwerp family, Rubens moved to Antwerp in 1587 where, after leaving school, he became a pupil of Adam van Noort and Otto van Veen. From 1600-08 he lived in Italy, entering the service of Vincenzo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua, on whose behalf he visited Spain in 1603. He returned to Antwerp in 1608 and was appointed painter to the Brussels Court of the Archduke Albert in the following year. He was commissioned by Marie de M\u00e9dicis to execute a series of paintings for the Luxembourg and accordingly visited Paris in 1622 and 1625. His activities as a diplomat took him to Spain in 1628 and to London in 1629-30, when he was knighted by Charles I. Having returned to Antwerp in 1630, he carried out the paintings for the ceiling of the Whitehall Banqueting House in the succeeding year. He died in 1640, renowned as a courtier and diplomat as well as a painter. \n\n308\nWAR & VICTORY: MODEL FOR A TITLE PAGE \nPanel, grisaille \n6 5/8 X 5 1/8 (16.8 x 13) \nD.1399-1891\n\nThis is the design for the frontispiece of Diego de Aedo y Gallaert, <i>El memorabile y glorioso viage del infante Cardenal D. Fernando de Austria </i>,Antwerp, 1635 (also in French), dealing with the journey of the Cardinal Infant Ferdinand from Spain to Brussels, where he had been appointed Governor of the Netherlands. The depiction of Mars and Victory refers to the prominent part taken by Ferdinand in the victory over the Protestants at N\u00f6rdlingen 5-6 Sept. 1634. He held his entry into Brussels 4 Nov. 1634. \nThe panel was originally larger and contained Rubens' descriptive notes at the sides. The remnants of these are still visible on the left. In the 18th century, while in the possession of P.-J, Mariette, the panel was cut down to Within 5 mm. of the painted area and Mariette transcribed Rubens' notes on to a label still stuck on to the back of the panel: \n'Voicy l'explication du sujet de ce tableau telle que Rubens l'avoit ecrite luy m\u00eame. \n'L'Arme del Sigr Infante Carde. Si compara il viaggio di S.A. ad una Aquila volante, con un serpente tr\u00e0 le ungue. \n'Duoi Geni che coronano S.A.Sma et hanno l'ale di papilione che dinotano l'eternit\u00e0 della sua gloria. \n'La Vittoria che porge a l'aquila una corona alloro significa che mediante la vittoria di Nordlingh e ristorate l'Imperio. \n'Gli duoi arbori di palme che sostengono l'arme di S. A. designano Vittoria, e forza perche l'alzano contra il peso. \n'Marte gradivo per denotar le vittorie di S.

The voyage of his highness is compared to a flying eagle, with a serpent in its talons. The two Genii crowning [the arms of] His Serene Highness have butterfly wings, which denote the eternity of his glory. Victory holds a laurel wreath up to the eagle which signifies that Empire was restored through the victory at Nordlingen. The two palm trees supporting the arms of His Highness signify victory and strength for they hold the shield despite its weight. Mars is striding forward to indicate the victories worn by His Highness on his voyage. \n'This was written by Rubens at the side of the picture which was cut down to make it more agreeable in shape. It is the design for a Frontispiece of a book entitled The Voyage of the Cardinal Infant. It was engraved by Marinus.' \nThe composition was engraved by Marinus in reverse for the title-page of the book. In the engraving the title fills the central space, the arms of Ferdinand have been inserted, as has the imprint of the publisher (Juan Crobbart [Cnobbaert]) in the cartouche at the bottom.  \n\nProv.

The subject refers to the prominent part taken by Don Ferdinand in the victory over the Protestants at Nordlingen on Sept. 5-6, 1634. He held his entry into Brussels onNov. 4, 1634. \nWhile in Marinus's engraving of the frontispiece the figures are seen in the usual way, they appear by consequence left-handed inRubens' model. \nWhen the picture entered Mariette's Collection the panel was larger, \nand contained on its borders detailed explanations written in Rubens' hand; some words are still visible, to the left. Mariette made a transcript of these inscriptions, pasted them on the back of the panel, and added, in French: 'Cecy \u00e9toit \u00e9crit de la main de Rubens sur les bol'd. du tableau qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rogn\u00e9 pour le rendre d'une forme plus agr\u00e9able..' Mariette's transcript of Rubens' Italian text is printed in Rooses, Vol. V, p. 353. An English version is as follows: 'The coat of arms of the Cardinal-Infant. His voyage is compared to a flying eagle with a serpent between its talons. Two Genii, who are crowning the coat of arms, have butterflies' wings to denote the eternity of his glory Victoria, who offers a laurel crown to the eagle, signifies that theEmpire was restored by the victory of Nordlingen. The two palm trees supporting the escutcheon designate victory and strength; they hold it aloft in spite of its weight. 'Mars gradivus' (Mars striding) denotes the victories obtained by the Cardinal Infant during \nvoyage'. \n<i>Lent by the Victoria and Albert Museum.</i>\n<u>Olieverfschetsen van Rubens [tentoonstelling] Museum Boymans Rotterdam, 1953</u> Rotterdam, 1953.\nThe following is the full text of the catalogue entry :\n\n\n\n<b>98.Oorlog en overwinning, ontwerp voor een titelpagina.</b> \n\n<i>afmeting</i> Paneel, 17 x 13 cm. \n<i>verzameling</i> Victoria and Albert Museum, Londen. \n<i>bijzonderheden</i> Deze grisaille-schets is het ontwerp voor een titelpagina die een uitbeelding is van het belangrijke aandeel dat de Cardinaal Infant Ferdinand had in de overwinning op de Protestanten bij N\u00f6rdlingen (5-6 Sept. 1634). R ubens schreef naast de voorstelling in het Italiaans een verklaring hier van, die in vertaling luidt: \"De wapens van de Cardinaal Infant. Zijn reis wordt vergeleken met een vliegende adelaar met een slang tussen diens klauwen. Twee genii die Zijne Hoogheid kronen hebben vlinder-vleugels om de eeuwigheid van zijn roem aan te tonen. Victoria, die een laurier-kroon aan de adelaar aanbiedt, betekent dat door de overwinning bij N\u00f6rdlingen het Imperium is hersteld. De twee palmbomen die het wapenschild dragen betekenen Overwinning en Kracht, omdat zij het schild omhoog houden ondanks het gewicht, \"Mars Gravidus\" (de schrijdende Mars) de overwinningen door Cardinaal Infant behaald gedurende zijn reis\". Dit opschrift, waarvan nu nog slechts \nenkele letters aan de linkerzijde over zijn, was nog in zijn geheel aanwezig toen de schets, groter dan thans, in het bezit van Mariette was. Hij schreef de inscriptie over en plakte deze op de achterzijde, waaraan hij toevoegde: \"Cecy \u00e9toit \u00e9crit de la main de Rubens sur les bords du tableau qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rogn\u00e9 pour le rendre d'une forme plus agr\u00e9able ... \". \nDe titelpagina werd gegraveerd door Marinus voor het boek: Aedo y Gallart, El memorabile y glorioso Viage del infante Cardenal D. Fernando de Austria, Amberes 1635. \n\nDe schets is, zoals uit het voorgaande blijkt, in 1634-35 ontstaan. \n<i>gegraveerd</i> Door Marinus, zie boven (V.S.

            "historical_context_note": "This painting was created as a model for a frontispiece, i.e. a title page for the Spanish edition of Diego de Aedo y Gallart's \"El Memorable y Glorioso Viaje del Infante Cardenal D. Fernando de Austria\" published in Antwerp by Jan Cnobbaert in1635, which recounts the voyage of the Cardinal Infante Ferdinand of Austria from Spain to Brussels where he had been appointed Governor of the Netherlands. It is one of only three known oil sketches in grisaille (monochrome painting) by Rubens for title pages. \n\nThe composition was engraved by Marinus van der Goes as Rubens very rarely engraved himself his compositions for prints. The centre has been left blank to insert the title of the book and is flanked by the God of War, Mars, on the right, and the allegory of Victory, identifiable to the palm leaves she holds in her hand, on the left. At the top, two Genii crown the coat of arms of the Cardinal Infante Ferdinand with wreaths. In the engraved editions of the book, both in French and Spanish, the position of the figures is reversed (See for example engravings in The British Museum: 1857,0314.6. (Spanish Edition), 1891, 0414.1299 and 1857,0314.7 (French edition). \n\nThis model is one of 48 known title pages that Rubens created, the majority of which were made for the Plantin-Moretus press in Antwerp for books on everything from theology, politics, history, archaeology, philology, poetry and science. Rubens' drawings for book illustrations and title pages are distinct in that they are more precise, finished and are executed by the artist's own hand. In these models, Rubens took care that his figures would appear right-handed when the design was reversed in the final print. Before the final design was engraved, a draft such as this would be submitted to the author.",
