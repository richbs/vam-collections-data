They were evidently patented in 1862: child-sized versions seem to have been introduced a little later later than those for adults, but continued in use into the 1930s. Combinations were made in a variety of fabrics, but in the UK those for children were often made from knitted woollen or cotton yarn.\n\nMany families came to see them as quintessentially childhood garments.  The lack of need for fastening or elastic around the waist may have made them more comfortable to wear and  more easily washed; they also gave a neater appearance beneath clothes, and provided a warm layer of clothing in winter.  Child wearers would not necessarily have agreed about the comfort, especially in warm weather, or when the fabric from which the combinations were made irritated the skin.",
