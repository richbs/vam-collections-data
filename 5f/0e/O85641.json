Only a very high base is preserved, as well as the margin on the right in the form of a tall rectangular niche containing a putto standing frontally on a vase-like socle and playing a sort of lute.  The head is broken off.\nIn the centre Queen Maya stands in the position typical  for this scene, with her left leg crossed over the right leg.  She has supported herself with her left arm against her sister Mahaprajapati, who faces her, while her right arm reached out to the branches of the sala tree, of which only the outlines are still preserved.  She is wearing a garment with wide trousers, the child emerges from her right side and is received by the god standing next to her, his hands covered in shawl.  Behind Mahaprajapati, in the corner stands another smaller male figure with hands joined piously.",
