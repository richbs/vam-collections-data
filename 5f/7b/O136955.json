A rear apron arises abruptly at the back of the blade;  it has a multi-curved chrysanthemum-like contour and an applied strengthening strap;  it holds an up-sloping cannon-end handle that has a Corian ring finial, and half round closures at both ends of the handle.",

Simplicity of form and elaborate ornamentation have also resulted in a blending of the modern and the traditional, making it a timeless object that crosses cultures. Yuen Kee-Ho has exploited the different textures that are possible on silver through sanding, brushing and polishing to create a rich surface pattern that contrasts with the smooth, simple design of the handle.  His sensitivity to surface patterning can be connected to the flat chasing of the English silversmiths, Rod Kelly and Michael Lloyd.",
