It is dedicated to the producer Oscar Barrett who died in 1941 aged 95. During his career he had a great deal of  pantomime experience, in 1892 producing pantomimes at both the Crystal Palace and the Olympic Theatre. He was originally a musical director who composed for shows at Drury Lane Theatre. In 1896 he took over as manager of Drury Lane after the death of Sir Augustus Harris. His son Oscar Barrett jnr. (1875-1943) became a theatre and cinema manager and Secretary of the Green Room Club.\n\nOscar Barrett was determined to produce pantomimes of the highest quality, using the leading designers, composers and actors for his productions. As reported in the New York Times, 24 April 1894, he said: 'I consider that we can do with what we call our pantomime from an art point of view as much as, or even more than, can be done with a Shakespearean play... The work of the costumes, and in fact, every element of the spectacular, can be utilised to a far greater extent in our Christmas pantomimes than in any other form of entertainment.'",
