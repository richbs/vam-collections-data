The bottom section features vertical scrolls; the second features a circular scroll design; the third features scrolls within pointed arches. Above this, a narrow small section features running  scrollwork; above which are a total of six quatrefoils within large square sections. There is a square lock with a scrolled handle, set into one gate, with  scrollwork around the keyhole. There is no key. The horizontal and vertical bars of the gate have surface decoration in the form of small punched circles, rectangles and groups of diagonal lines.",

They result from the extensive work on restoring the cathedral carried out between 1863 and 1878  by the architect, George Gilbert Scott. The design for the chancel screeen was probably the result of a collaboration between Scott and his favourite ironworker, Francis Skidmore of Coventry, and is clearly inspired by 12th to13th-century ironwork, such as the grille thought to be from the shrine of St Swithun, in Winchester Cathedral. The  Salisbury screen can be compared with the Scott/Skidmore designs of 1862 for the Hereford Cathedral screen, Museum no. M.251-1984, which is far more elaborate. The Salisbury screen was removed amidst much controversy in 1959. Much of the screen was destroyed and these gates are the principal survivors.",
