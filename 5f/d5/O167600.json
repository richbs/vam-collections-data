Examining the furniture at leisure, I am even more impressed with its quality and importance than when I saw it in your house\".\n\n29/6/37, Browett notes in making the gift\n\"the only merit I claim is that the collection has been gathered together on a very slender income, and as the \u2026.articles\u2026.represent practically the whole of my life's savings the items which I am giving to your Museum constitute a very real sacrifice\".\n\n31/8/37 letter the Director, Maclagan, to Browett\nthanks \"for the invaluable assistance which you have given us by your generosity.  It is not very long since our collection of English Furniture was universally recognised as being hopelessly inadequate\u2026..the acquisition of so many first rate examples together marks a really notable step in its improvement\u2026.Visitors\u2026will..be deeply indebted to your taste and liberality\".\n\n9/10/37 by Ralph Edwards for Country Life\non the subject of the V & A's special exhibition of Browett's gift.\n\nThere are no specific references to the chair, its history or condition on the nominal file.",
