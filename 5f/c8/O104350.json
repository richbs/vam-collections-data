These tickets also illustrate, in miniature, the skills of the silversmith over the last two hundred years. While the variety of styles and materials was enormous, silver bottle tickets tended to reflect fashionable designs in metalware generally.\n\nHester Bateman was a successful female silversmith. She learned her trade from her husband and set up in her own right on his death in 1760. She probably managed the workshop rather than made the silver herself. The firm produced cheaper, thin gauge domestic tablewares using a limited range of ornament for largely middle- class customers. Members of her family, such as her daughter-in-law Ann and her son Peter, joined the business and continued it after her retirement in 1790.",
