They may be intended as sleeve panels, inside the open seam of a man\u2019s doublet or a woman\u2019s jacket or gown as was fashionable in the 1620s.  However, other sleeve panels are ovoid shape to fill a similar shape opening in the sleeve.  Nor is it clear how and to what the loops on three sides would fasten.  \n\nThe date of the embroidery appears earlier than the 1620s.  The simple speckling corresponds to the period 1590 to 1610 during the transition from the geometrical patterns of the 16th century to the shaded speckling of the 17th century.  The sleeves of this period were very full at the shoulder tapering to a narrow wrist, with the seams closed.  So it is not clear how these panels would have been used in the fashions of 1590 to 1610.",
