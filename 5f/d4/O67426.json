James Sherwood Westmacott (1823 - 1900) was a member of the Westmacott dynasty of sculptors active in the late 18th and early 19th century, and carved several reliefs in this distinctive style. He was the son of the sculptor Henry Westmacott. Among his chief works are a 'Victory' statue at Dresden and a statue of 'Peri' and of 'Alfred the Great'.",
