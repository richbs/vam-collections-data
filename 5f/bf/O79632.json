They were often very heavy, made of cast silver, and represented a major part of the wearer\u2019s dowry.  The name khulkhal is a generic Arabic name for anklets.\n\nAnklets like this one were usually worn by children.  The bells helped their mother to track their movements, but also had a more important amuletic function, as the sound was believed to avert evil spirits.  It was bought for four shillings and sixpence (the pair) at the International Exhibition, London, in 1872, as an example of traditional Syrian jewellery for children.",
