Worn by Romeo in Rudolf Nureyev' Romeo and Juliet. The waist-length doublet is cut straight at the base indicating that is one of the originals made for London Festival Ballet (the company for which Nureyev created the production in 1977) rather than a later re-make for other companies when a slightly V-shape waistline was adopted. Nureyev always liked to keep costumes a brief as possible to allow complete freedom of movement. \n\nWhile Romeo\u2019s costume is basic those worn by dancers in less strenuous roles were more elaborate. Visual inspiration came from paintings of the fourteenth and fifteenth century. Fabrics were specially printed ion Italy with designs copied from canvases and frescoes. While Romeo\u2019s costume is fastened with Velcro and hooks and eyes (for quick changes into a shirt) others have traditional lacings and ties. Some of the women, most notably Rosaline and her friends wear \u2018balzi\u2019, high rounded headdresses worn on artificially high foreheads, fashionable in early quatrocento Italy. As with many ballet productions of Romeo and Juliet the costumes for the opposing factions were colour-coded with the Montegues appearing in green and white and the Capulets in shades of red and pink with white.",
