They were created by artists, block cutters and printers working independently to the instructions of specialist publishers. Landscape views became very popular in 19th-century Japan, a reflection of the growth of travel and the associated demand for depictions of famous beauty spots. Hiroshige was especially well known for his work in this field.\n\nPlace\nSaij\u00f4 is situated on the Inland Sea on the island of Shikoku. It developed as a castle town during the Edo period (1615-1868), and is very near to Mt Ishiyama, the chief peak in the Shikoku Mountains.\n\nTime\nThis print was published in Edo just at the time that commercial and diplomatic ties were being established between Japan and western nations in the mid to late 1850s. During the second half of the 19th century large numbers of prints were exported to Europe and the United States. They were avidly sought out by western collectors, artists and designers, and played a major role in the development of 'Japonisme' and then art nouveau.",
