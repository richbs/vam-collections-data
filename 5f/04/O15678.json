            "public_access_description": "Elsa Schiaparelli was famous for her attractive and wittily designed evening ensembles. Her clothes were smart, sophisticated and often wildly eccentric, and she had a huge following. Her ideas, coupled with designs she commissioned from famous artists, were carried out with considerable skill. Salvador Dal\u00ed, Christian B\u00e9rard and Jean Cocteau, for example, designed fabrics and accessories. Jean Schlumberger produced costume jewellery and buttons. Art movements such as Cubism and Surrealism influenced her designs. She used tweed to make evening wear and hessian for dresses. She dyed furs, put padlocks on suits and popularised Tyrolean peasant costume.  \n\nThis jacket employs a subtle yet innovative use of different fabrics and textures. Schiaparelli cleverly combines a classic tailored cut with vibrant colour and unusual metal coiled trimmings. This garment, which caused astonishment in the 1930s, now seems feminine and uncontroversial.",
