His father had worked as a designer for the S\u00e8vres porcelain factory in France, and then from 1871 for Minton\u2019s of Stoke-on-Trent in Staffordshire. L. V. Solon was born in England and also went to work for Minton\u2019s. Father and son both specialised in grotesque pattern.\n\nThis wonderfully drawn ewer is based on grotesque patterns of the 16th century. The panels of allegorical figures relate to ceramic production. The vessel was conceived as a support for decorative painting of the highest quality. It was probably intended as an exhibition piece to demonstrate what Minton and its world-renowned painters could do.",
