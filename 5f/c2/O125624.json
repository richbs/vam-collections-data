The other shows King Melchisedek blessing Abraham and Abraham\u2019s nephew Lot being captured.\n\nIt was a medieval custom to interpret the Old Testament as a prefiguration of the New.  Each major New Testament subject was seen as having several forerunners or \u2018types\u2019 in the Old Testament.  Cain murdering Abel was often interpreted as a forerunner of Christ\u2019s betrayal by Judas, while Melchisedek giving Abraham bread and wine was widely accepted as prefiguring the Eucharist.\n\nThis particular manuscript leaf may have come from a Bible or Psalter (book of Psalms), or an artist\u2019s Model Book.  Another fragment thought to be from the same manuscript is located in Li\u00e8ge University (Wittert Coll.) and a group of similar leaves is found in Berlin (Staatliche Museen Preussischer Kulturbesitz, Kupferstichkabinet, inv. No. 78 A 6). \n\nThe leaf was purchased by the V&A in 1883 for \u00a32.",

            "history_note": "This manuscript leaf was one of a group of seemingly unrelated leaves purchased from W. H. J. Weale on April 9th 1883.  As a whole, the group cost \u00a326.17.6.  Individually, this leaf cost \u00a32.\n\nThe entry in the Register of Drawings 1880 to 1884 (museum numbers 8526 to 11002) lists the leaf as:\n\n<i>Miniature.  The sacrifices of Abel and Cain, and the murder of Abel.  On the verso: Melchisedech offering bread and wine to Abram, and Abram's servants driving cattle and prisoners. Li\u00e8ge, xii cent.</i>\n\nHistorical significance: This particular leaf and another at Li\u00e8ge University (Wittert Coll.) are thought to have come from the same manuscript.  Both are very similar to a group of leaves located in Berlin (Staatliche Museen Preussischer Kulturbesitz, Kupferstichkabinet, inv. No. 78 A 6) but are unlikely to be from the same manuscript as one of the scenes, Melchisedek blessing Abraham, is repeated.\n\nThe larger group of leaves in Berlin has been the subject of much discussion as to whether or not it should be regarded as a model book or as the remains or a fragment of a Bible or Psalter (see <i>Exemplum</i>, Scheller, pp.123-131).  Similar uncertainty surrounds the V&A\u2019s leaf but with less leaves to work from it is perhaps even more difficult to say whether it is one thing or another.  \n\nIn both cases the similarities between the leaves and the work of Mosan artists working in the Li\u00e8ge region of France has been commented upon.  Scenes of Cain and Abel sacrificing and Melchisedek blessing Abraham appear in identical form and typological context on contemporary enamelled crosses produced in that area.  \n\nThis has lead to the suggestion that the leaves formed part of a model book used by Mosan goldsmiths.  Whether this were the case or not, the style of all the leaves is so similar to both manuscripts (compare, for example, the Floreffe Bible) and enamels produced in the Li\u00e8ge region in the mid twelfth century that their place of origin, at least, seems certain.",

            "historical_context_note": "Many twelfth century Psalters and Bibles included an introductory cycle of miniatures.  These often incorporated scenes from the Book of Genesis. It was a medieval custom to interpret the Old Testament as a prefiguration of the New.  Each major New Testament subject was seen as having several forerunners or \u2018types\u2019 in the Old Testament - Cain and Abel sacrificing was seen as symbolising the Synagogue and the Church; Cain murdering Abel was seen as a forerunner of Christ\u2019s betrayal by Judas; and Melchisedek giving Abraham bread and wine was widely accepted as prefiguring the Eucharist.\n\nData taken from notes compiled by Rowan Watson.
