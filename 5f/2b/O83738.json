It was ordered by Lady Cornwallis (nee Esme d\u2019Beaumont, 1901-69) to wear for the coronation celebrations in June.  Although Cavanagh had been in business for just one year, he had already secured a reputation as a talented designer.  \n\nThe fabric designed by Oliver Messel (1904-1978), at the time Britain\u2019s foremost designer of costumes and sets for stage and film, was commissioned by Nicholas (\u2018Miki\u2019) Sekers, who owned West Cumberland Silk Mills.  \n\nThe fabric of the gown was made using a weave particular to the Sekers company at this time.  It is made of two separate layers of silk joined to form the design.  This is of scattered semi-naturalistic orchids woven in oyster, pale-pink and green silk enriched with gold threads.",

Mr. Sekers and Mr. Messel have known each other for some time, indeed they have worked together for Glyndebourne, but this is the first time that Mr. Messel has actually designed fabrics to be reproduced on a loom.  In fact, when Mr, Sekers asked him him he would make the designs, his firs reaction was to say that he knew nothing of any of the technicalities which normally go with textile designing.  \n\nThe designs themselves were so delicate and unusual that we made a special fabric for them - two layers of fine silk which are quite separate expect where they are actually joined together to form the design.  As well as in silk each one is woven also with gold thread which in the bottom layer of the fabric when it comes to the surface with the design.  \n\nThis double weaving technique not only does justice to Mr. Messel's designs but also makes it possible to achieve subtle and interesting colours.  \n\nThe colours are absolutely inter-changeable, so if there is a colour in 'Jewels' that is particularly liked, it can be woven also in 'Acorn, 'Scattered Leaves', 'Juliet', Miniver', and 'Twigs'.  \n\nThe other fabrics in the collection are all pure silk, or a mixture of silk and mohair, alpaca, wool, worsted or gold.  It is quite a feature of the range, this mixture of yarns.  They are all called into used for their different qualities.  Mohair has a delicate sheen, wool has its softness and warmth of handle, the alpaca is in one quality only, Langulval mixed with silk, and only in its natural colour.\n\nI know that Mr. Sekers would be very honoured if Her Majesty the Queen Mother and Her Majesty the Queen would choose from the collection any of the fabrics which they like.  We will arrange for them to be produced immediately.\n\nYours sincerely,\nWilcox, C., ed., <i>The Golden Age of Couture: Paris and London 1947-57</i> (V&A Publications, London: 2007), pp.110-1 and pl.4.17-4.20",
