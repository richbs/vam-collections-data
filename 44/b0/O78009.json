Vessels for sauces became an essential item on the British dinner table around 1720, when French-style sauces became popular. Late 18th-century examples are usually tureen-shaped and supported on a central foot. They usually had an underdish or stand, to prevent spillage, and a matching ladle.\n\nUse\nThe five main sauces introduced by the French were b\u00e9chamel, brune/espagnol, tomate, mayonnaise, and velout\u00e9. Gravies made from roasted meat flavoured with wine, citrus juice, capers, herbs and spices were also popular in 18th-century Britain. Other sauces had a 'roux' base, made by combining butter or lard with flour and broth or milk, and flavoured with parsley, onions, celery, anchovies, oysters, cockles or eggs. Butter sauces, served in smaller sauce boats or butter boats, frequently accompanied vegetables. A hot sauce of wine, butter and sugar was the most common one for puddings.\n\nTrading\nWedgwood sold his pottery through his London warehouse and from his Staffordshire factory site. He also sold large quantities of pottery to export merchants and agents abroad. Sauce tureens of this design were among the illustrations of his unpublished creamware catalogue of about 1790. Wedgwood sold an earlier design of sauce tureen and stand at two shillings each wholesale.",
