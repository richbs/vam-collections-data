They were often embroidered, sometimes by family members or even by the future bride.\n\nA hand-written paper label sewn into this waistcoat links this to the marriage of John Montefiore and Julia Norman on the 28th January 1845. This waistcoat was embroidered by the bride, but was probably not intended for her husband-to-be. We have the white and silver figured silk waistcoat he wore for the ceremony, and another smaller, identically embroidered waistcoat also associated with the wedding (see T.668-1919 and T.669-1919). The measurements of these waistcoats show that John Montefiore was rather smaller than the man for whom this waistcoat was made.\n\nThe choice of forget-me-nots, which signify fidelity, would have been appropriate for a wedding waistcoat. The personal nature of the embroidery and the size suggest that this waistcoat may have been worked for a close male relative, perhaps Julia's father as she had no brothers, to wear to the wedding.",

It was probably not worn by John Montefiore as the bridegroom's waistcoat, of silver and white brocaded silk, is smaller in size than this. There is another embroidered waistcoat which is closer in size to the white waistcoat.\n\nThe waistcoats were given to the V&A in 1919 by the Misses Montefiore in accordance with the wishes of his son (unclear whether he was their father or brother), also called John Montefiore (1851-1916)",
