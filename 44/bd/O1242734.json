From 1921 printed textiles were manufactured at the Uxbridge Factory, joined by weaving production in 1934.  Initial known as Eton Rural Cretonnes, Eton Rural Fabrics from around 1922 and Sanderson Fabrics from 1936, this successful branch of the company are noted for quality furnishing fabrics created by the Sanderson Studio and freelance artists and designers.  \n\nSanderson is most closely associated with the English chintz style, yet their designs have always moved with the times, reflecting contemporary style and new technologies.  The first Triad Collection was launched in 1962, and quickly dominated the home furnishing market.  A collection of co-ordinated fabrics and wallpapers was produced every two years from 1962-1981, when it was replaced by the more diverse Options range.  Described as 'a new concept in co-ordination', the first Triad Collection consisted of sixty eight machine printed patterned wallpapers, each with a matching textile and plain companion wallpaper.  Although the collection was dominated by small scale florals, some modern designs were also included.  'Trio' is one such example and reflects a vogue for more figurative designs.\n\nIn 1899 the Buckton Vale Print Works in Stalybridge, Cheshire, became part of the Calico Printers Association and was renamed the Calprina Works.  Calprina Limited closed in 1999 when it was acquired by the Leeds Group plc and the print machines were transferred to Leeds.\n\nCalprina was originally named the Buckton Vale Print Works, which became part of the Calico Printers Association in 1899a textile print works based in Stalybridge, Cheshire.",
