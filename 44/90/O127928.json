He took drawing lessons with Constant Vaucher but was essentially self-taught in the French Romantic tradition. He was considered the leader of the Geneva school and the most representative painter of the Reformation. He exhibited at the Salon in the Mus\u00e9e Rath, Geneva, as early as 1826 and subsequently at the Royal Academy, London (1839) and the Paris Salon (1831, 1840, 1841, 1843 and 1847). He was praised by the critics and Louis-Philippe and Ary Scheffer were among his admirers.\n\nThis painting is a good example the history scenes produced in Geneva during the 19th century.. It shows the queen Catherine de Medicis contemplating the head of Coligny. This scene commemorate an important event of the reformation, when on the night of St Bartholomew's day when the Portestants were slaughtered by the Catholics following the revocation of the 'edict of Nantes' (22 October 1685). This work is typical of the history paintings produced in Geneva as they draw especially from the history of the Reformation.",

Catherine is shown looking at Coligny's head, which is lying on the table before her, wrapped in a white cloth. The subject is unusual in French painting. \nThe original attribution was to Jan Mostaert (c. 1475-1555) (1893 <i>Catalogue</i>, p. 182), an artist who, as John Pope-Hennessy (1940) pointed out, died many years before the event represented in the picture. Pope-Hennessy attributed it to the early Delacroix. This attribution has not found general acceptance, though it is undoubtedly true that the picture should be given to a French painter of the Romantic period. \n\nCondition. The panel is wedge-shaped and was presumably originally prepared for a different purpose. \nProv. The Rev. C. H. Townshend; bequeathed to the Museum in 1868. \nLit. J.

History painting could include religious themes, or depictions of momentous recent events, but the term was most frequently associated with Classical subject-matter. However a renewed impetus was given to religious subjects after the Council of Trent (1545-63), which stipulated new iconographical programmes. The development of art treatises, in which the compositional rules guiding the art of painting were discussed also notably, influenced the evolution of history painting. From around 1600 history painting's principal rivals: still-life, landscape and genre painting began to emerge as independent collectable genres. Furthermore, the Rococo taste for the ornamental in the early 18th century prioritised the decorative quality of history painting, so that subject matters became more entertaining than exemplary. There was a renewed interest in history painting during the Neo-Classical period after which the taste for such pictures faded towards the end of the 19th century when an innovative approach to the image was led by the Symbolists and was developed further by subsequent schools in the early 20th century.",
