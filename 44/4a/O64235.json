The Buddha wears a tall crown and transparent robe which clings to the body and is adorned with a necklace and earrings. The use of royal imagery to evoke spiritual authority is most manifest in this representation. He is seated on a lotus throne beneath which rests a thunderbolt sceptre (<i>vajra</i>), symbol of an enlightened mind, and with his right hand he points to the earth as witness of his enlightenment (<i>bhumisparsha mudra</i>). Beneath the vajra appears the Earth Goddess Prithvi, bearing witness to the Buddha's authority. On either side of the goddess are lion and elephant throne-supports and the kneeling figures of two female devotees. To the Buddha's left stands a Bodhisattva perhaps Maitreya, with his right hand holding a rosary pressed to his breast. The left hand holds a leafy plant. To the Buddha's right stands the Bodhisattva Padmapani holding the stem of a lotus in his left hand, the right displaying the abhaya mudra or gesture of protection. Seated on lotus thrones above the standing figures are the Bodhisattvas Vajrapani (to the Buddha's right) and Manjusri, their emblems, the thunderbolt and the book of scripture, supported by lotuses at their sides. Above these in conventional clouds fly two celestial beings bearing scarves, each with a smaller figure to the rear. Behind the Buddha is his throne, the top of which ends in<i> makara</i> (sea monster) heads and supports an aureole with a <i>kinnara </i>(bird-legged celestial musician) perched on either side.",

            "public_access_description": "This sculpture shows Buddha Shakyamuni wearing the crown and ornaments of a monarch, combined with the simple monastic robes of a monk. The tall tripartite crown, necklace and earrings contrast dramatically with the unadorned transparent robe. \n\nThis representation clearly uses royal imagery to evoke spiritual authority. The Buddha is seated on a double-lotus throne beneath which rests a thunderbolt sceptre (\u2018vajra\u2019), symbol of an enlightened mind. With his right hand he points to the earth as witness of his resistance of the temptations of wordly attachment represented by the demonic goddess Mara. \n\nThe throne is decorated with an elaborate aureole and back plate with \u2018makara\u2019 (sea monster) finials upon which are perched \u2018kinnara\u2019 (half-bird celestial musicians). Beneath the lotus-throne appears the Earth Goddess Prithvi, bearing witness to the Buddha's yogic asceticism. The goddess is flanked by lion and elephant throne-supports, emblematic of the Buddha\u2019s strength and nobility. \n\nThe two kneeling figures may be identified as a donor couple. The Buddha is attended by the bodhisattvas Avalokitesvara and Maitreya, each standing on a lotus stem. Seated on lotus-thrones above the standing figures are the bodhisattvas Vajrapani and Manjusri. They are identified by their lotus-borne emblems, the \u2018vajra\u2019 and the manuscript book of scripture respectively. Above are celestial adorers, presenting bearing garlands. Graffiti crudely engraved on the base-moulding depict offerings and ritual utensils.",

ISBN 978-81-909950-0-9. pp.87-8 no.35 and fig. 72\nThe Buddha Shakyamuni wearing the crown and ornaments of a monarch\nEastern India/ late 11th or early 12th century\nBlack Basalt/ 125cm\n\nDuring his lifetime the Buddha never wished to be regarded as anything more than a simple monk. It was inevitable that he should become deified, but precisely why and how he came to be represented as a monarch during the Pala period is not known. It may have been due to the combination of several reasons not least among them the popular identification of the monarch with a deity. As is so often the case with Indian deities, the Buddha is not worshipped in isolation but surrounded by minor deities such as here with Avalokiteshvara on his right and Maitreya on his left. Engraved on the bottom are offerings and objects used in the ritual of worship.\n\nSee no.14",
