The ebony veneer is composed of a large number of small fragments pieced together, presumably in order to achieve uniformity in the colour of the wood. The whole surface is carved with interlacing strapwork intersprersed with bunches of fruit and animals derived from Flemish 16th century pattern books of engraved ornament, or perhaps from Jost Amman's engravings in the Flemish manner. The stag-horn plaques, which are executed with exceptional fineness, are carved with hunting subjects and with half and full length figures of Turks, including a standard bearer on the butt plate, musketeers on the underside of the stock, archers etc.\n\nThe lock, of normal German construction, is engraved over the whole of its exterior surface with figures emblematic of abundance amidst foliate scrolls. The ring securing the wheel to the lockplate and other details of the lock, the trigger and the trigger guard are gilt. A maker's mark on the lockplate is indecipherable.\n\nThe octagonal barrel is engraved over its whole surface with foliate scrolls enclosing eight oval panels with emblematic female figures from the muzzle to the breech; Temperance, faith, Fortitude, Truth, Justice, Charity, Humility, Prayer.",
