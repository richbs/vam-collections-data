The subject is taken from William Shakespeare's As you like it, Art II, scene i. \n\nBorn in Northumberland, Lough maintained close links in his home county. He received several commissions from Sir Matthew Ridley, a local landowner, including ten statues representing characters from Shakespeare for Sir Matthew's London home. Described by Lough as 'lyric sculptures', these were ambitious departures from accepted classical subjects, but received criticism from contemporary commentators for failiong to illustrate the essence of the characters.",
