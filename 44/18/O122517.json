The right bar of the initial is a column with a red, blue and gold chequered pattern and the cross bar is red with blue outline and white decoration. The initial is set against a gold, blue and white chequered background below the cross bar and foliage with acorns above. A dog stands in the top margin and there is further decoration of grotesque heads, flowers and foliage in red, white, blue and green.\n\nThis initial comes from a Gradual and starts the introit for the first Sunday in Advent, incipit 'Ad te levavi'.\n\nOn the reverse is music on four line stave and text in gothic script, quadrata (textualis), with decorated inital A?, height of stave and text together, in ink with red line.",

These were at this time added by specialist illuminators and rubricators, in spaces left blank by the scribe. The more important initials might be historiated with a figurative picture (<i>istoire</i> being the term for a story), or decorated, while the lesser initials might be made of coloured letters on coloured or gold grounds or even simply a letter slightly larger than the main body of text and picked out in a contrasting colour such as red or blue.\n\nIntroits, which were the first sung elements of the Mass were often introduced by historiated initials in choir books. This initial A is for the introit for the first Sunday in Advent, which was the most elaborate and had the incipit 'Ad te levavi'. \n\nThis period of art is known as Gothic and began in the later twelfth century and ended sometime between ca. 1300 and the early sixteenth century, depending on the region. Underlying characteristics of Gothic art include a love of the grotesque, such as hybrid or distorted animals, which featured in marginal illuminations, and a decorative approach to initials, frames and backgrounds, with greater use of gilding. The diaper pattern often featured in Gothic decoration and the dragon was a decorative device used throughout Europe. \n\nAt this time such initials had antennae that reached into the margins, on which humorous or fantasy creatures played. They often featured elongated dragons, or grotesque heads grasping the initials between their teeth. Hybrid creatures made up of two different animals or with animal bodies and human faces were also common.\n\nSome of the above was taken from <i>Understanding Illuminated Manuscripts: A Guide to Technical Terms</i> by Michelle P. Brown (London, 1995)",

            "historical_context_note": "Music was incorporated into the Christian Liturgy early on and had been influenced by the use of music in the synagogue.  Plainchant (unison singing, originally unaccompanied) was the traditional music of the western Church and from about 1000, vocal polyphony (music with two or more melodically independent parts) was being practiced.  Polyphony made certain chants of the Mass longer and more complex.\n\nLiturgical manuscripts with musical components were either used in the celebration of the Mass or the Divine Office, the basis of Christian Liturgy. The Mass centres on the Eucharist and was attended daily by those in religious orders, the clergy and, with varying frequency, by members of the laity. The Gradual was the response and versicle to the Epistle reading that constitutes one part of the Mass, though the term is more commonly used to refer to the principal choir book used in the Mass. The name derives from the practice of singing the gradual on the steps of the raised pulpit. The choir book was arranged according to the liturgical year (Temporale- services for feast days and saints days around the Christmas period, Sanctorale or Proper of Saints- services for saints days, and Common of Saints- formulae for saints not given individual services within the Sanctoral or Temporale). In addition to the graduals, the choir book contains introits, which were the first sung elements of the Mass and were often introduced by historiated initials. The introit for the first Sunday in Advent was the most elaborate and had the incipit 'Ad te levavi' (I lift up my soul to you, my God). \n\nThe above is adapted from <i>Understanding Illuminated Manuscripts: A Guide to Technical Terms</i> by Michelle P.
