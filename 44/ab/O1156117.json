She stands in the midst of a country landscape in which are a target board and canopied tent.\n\nTinsel prints were created from etched portraits of theatrical stars in popular roles they played on the London stage. They were hand-painted in watercolour and decorated with scraps of material and tinsel additions. They were popular during the first half of the 19th century and were considered an adult, rather than a child's hobby. By the 1830s it was possible to buy the tinsel, leather and feather ornaments to go with each image.\n\nThis print is unusal in that it is not decorated with silk or metal embellishment and appears to have been coloured with watercolour.",
