Sk\u00e5ne province, in the extreme south of Sweden, has the richest tradition, and more jewellery was worn there than in any other district.   Almost all the Swedish traditional jewellery at the V&A comes from Sk\u00e5ne.  \n\nWhen Sweden became Protestant in 1527, Swedish women continued to wear crosses rich with symbolism and religious pendants like their medieval predecessors.  These round pendants were also called 'crosses', and had a strong religious character.  The Swedish word trillekors means a wheel-shaped cross.  This one is stamped with the monogram IHS, the first letters of the name Jesus in Greek.  The angel's head with wings attached, on the front, and the hollow ball beneath the suspension loop at the top, are both typical of Swedish traditional jewellery.\n\nThis pendant has a worn maker's mark, possibly HPV.  Hans Petter Vogt was a member of a family of silversmiths working in Kristianstad in the 18th and 19th centuries.",
