The lid shows a marquetry panel of symmetrical scrolls and small grotesque figures and birds, centreing on the figure of Minerva (with an owl at her feet) in a pink headdress and armour, part of which she holds in her right hand, with a long spear held in her left, standing on a trellised dais. The panel is framed with a flat gilt-brass border chased with acanthus leaf decoration.  The concave edges of the lid are set wtih boulle marquetry panels showing symmetrical scrolls with grotesque figures and animals, the corners set with flat, chased, gilt-brass leaf-shapes giving the appearance of mounts.  The front and side panels are similarly decorated with symmetrical scrolling patterns with sphinxes, grotesque figures and animals, all in boulle marquetry. The top and bottom edges of the box are set with gilt-brass mouldings, with repeating formal floral motifs.  The whole box is raised on small, tapering gilt-brass legs in the form of inverted balusters, with cast and chased decoration.\n\nThe inside of the box is lined with padded pink watered silk, possibly originally crimson. The front panel of the box can hinge down.  A button hidden beneath the silk releases a secret compartment beneath the apparent base of the box.",

            "public_access_description": "This box was one of the many pieces of French decorative art bequeathed to the V&A by John Jones in 1882. Jones made his fortune as a military tailor, kitting out the armies of the British Empire. He was also an avid collector of French furniture and porcelain, particularly of items made between about 1660 and 1800. \n\nThis box stood under a table in his dining room at 105 Piccadilly, which was decorated with the same marquetry of turtleshell with other materials such as brass, copper or pewter and mother-of-pearl. Jones greatly admired this difficult and decorative form of veneering furniture, known as boulle marquetry after the French cabinetmaker Andr\u00e9-Charles Boulle. It had first become fashionable just before 1700 and this box was probably made around that time, although the gilt brass legs were added in the middle of the 19th century, possibly not long before Jones bought it.",
