The rosettes are decorated alternately with a coil ring and a lozenge.  The seven bands are linked together twice on the back of the bracelet, to keep them from separating. The pin fastening is trapezoid in shape, and made of gilded sheet silver with engraved stylised floral decoration.  There are two pins, opening at the top and bottom of the hinge.  Each is made of a doubled strip of silver which is secured by a bar inside the loop, so that it cannot fall out and be lost.",

They were mainly worn by urban women, rather than tribal people.  They were originally always worn in pairs, one on each wrist, and in some places were regarded as the mark of a married woman.  They were worn by Christian and Jewish women, as well as Muslims.  The double pin, opening on each side of the fastening, is characteristic of bracelets of this kind from the eastern Mediterranean.\n\nThe elegant workmanship ensured that they were as popular with tourists in the 19th century as with natives, and similar bracelets are still being made in the region today.",
