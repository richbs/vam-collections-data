            "public_access_description": "A grisaille pen and ink drawing on oak of several yachts at sea, rolling on the waves under a clear sky.  Adriaen van Salm (1657-1720) worked as a schoolmaster and textile merchant in Delfshaven near Rotterdam. He also specialised in pen-painting, a branch of Dutch 17th-century maritime painting that experimented with the pictorial effects of blurring the boundaries between painting and the more linear graphic arts. Such scenes were executed in grisaille, a black and white rendering. Van Salm\u2019s aptitude for penschilderij, the technique of drawing onto a prepared oil ground using a reed pen and Indian ink, has attracted comparisons with Willem van de Velde the Elder. Van de Velde was, most likely, the inventor of this particular technique. 599-1886 shows several yachts at sea, and the artist has atmospherically captured the rolling of the boats on the waves under a clear sky. The composition is carefully constructed around the central perspective created by the arrangement of the ships towards the low horizon and accentuated by the contrasting diagonal of the advancing waves. The painting's spatial recession is enhanced by the technique of the pen-painting itself. Lines and shapes lighten as they move towards the horizon and the foreground is darker by employing parallel hatching. As in several of the artist's other marine paintings, his signature appears on a floating plank of wood, visible at lower left.  Although the work exploits these innovative techniques to their fullest, the painting should nonetheless be considered within to the tradition of the Dutch seascapes depicting everyday life in the North Sea, by earlier artists such as Jan Porcellis in the first half of the 17th century.",

London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, p.225. cat. no. 317.\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\nAdriaen van der SALM (active 1690; d. 1720). \nDutch School \nAlso recorded as Adriaen Salm, his date of birth is unknown, but he married in 1686, at which time he was a school master in Schonderloo. Most of his life was spent at Delfshaven, where he is recorded in 1693. His <i>Battle of Barfleur</i> (1692) at Greenwich suggests that he may have been active as a painter by that date, though there is no evidence that this picture represents an eye witness account or even a strictly contemporary view of the battle. Dated works are extremely rare; the <i>View of Delfshaven</i> at Greenwich is probably dated 1695. In 1706 he was a member of the Guild at Delft. He died at Delfshaven in 1720.\nSalm was a prolific producer of grisaille seascapes, including battle scenes of the War of the Spanish succession and fishing scenes. There are sixteen of his paintings in the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich. His son Roelof (1688-1756) worked in an identical manner. \n\n317 \nYACHTS SAILING IN A BREEZE \nInscribed on a piece of wood, lower left <i>A. SALM </i>\nOak panel \n7 X 10 \u00bc  (17.8 X 26) \n599-1886\n\nGrisaille seascapes, known as <i>Penschilderijen</i> and usually painted with a reed pen on specially prepared white ground, were common in Holland from the time of Willem van de Velde the elder (1611-93) until the middle of the 18th century. A collection of such works is exhibited at the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich. \nVan Overeem suggests that the town in the background may be Schiedam. \nCondition. Cleaned in 1961. \nProv.

            "history_note": "Purchased, 1886\n\nHistorical significance: Adriaen van Salm (1657-1720) worked as a schoolmaster and textile merchant in Delfshaven near Rotterdam. He also specialised in pen-painting, a branch of Dutch 17th-century maritime painting that experimented with the pictorial effects of blurring the boundaries between painting and the more linear graphic arts. Such scenes were executed in <i>grisaille</i>, a black and white rendering. Van Salm\u2019s aptitude for <i>penschilderij,</i> the technique of drawing onto a prepared oil ground using a reed pen and Indian ink, has attracted comparisons with Willem van de Velde the Elder. Van de Velde was, most likely, the inventor of this particular technique. Dr. Remmelt Daalder\nof the Nederlands Scheepvaartmuseum Amsterdam has identified the vessels in 599-1886 (written communication, March 2010) as a Dutch states' yacht, generally used as means of transportation for official bodies, like the Admiralty board, the East India Company or high ranking officials, at center and several inland barges for passengers and freight, such as the 'hektjalk' on the left. In the far left corner a 'flute', a sea-going threemaster. The town in the background may tentatively be identified as Schiedam, close to van Salm's native Delfshaven. The artist has atmospherically captured the rolling of the boats on the waves under a clear sky. The composition is carefully constructed around the central perspective created by the arrangement of the ships towards the low horizon and accentuated by the contrasting diagonal of the advancing waves. The painting's spatial recession is enhanced by the technique of the pen-painting itself. Lines and shapes lighten as they move towards the horizon and the foreground is darker by employing parallel hatching. As in several of the artist's other marine paintings, his signature appears on a floating plank of wood, visible at lower left.  Although the work exploits these innovative techniques to their fullest, the painting should nonetheless be considered within to the tradition of the Dutch seascapes depicting everyday life in the North Sea, by earlier artists such as Jan Porcellis in the first half of the 17th century.",

            "historical_context_note": "Marine paintings present sea subjects with particular attention to ships and shipping. When marine painting emerged as a distinct genre, in the 17th-century Dutch Republic, the initial focus was on large, publicly commissioned history paintings commemorating naval engagements against the Spanish and important political and commercial events. The genre was largely developed by Hendrick Vroom and from the 1620s onwards a market developed for smaller marine paintings, by such artists as Porcellis, de Vlieger, van de Cappelle, and van de Velde the younger, in which the interest lies in the broader depiction of atmospheric effects and the behaviour of the sea in various conditions. The Anglo-Dutch Wars (1652\u201374) revived interest in publicly commissioned historical painting, and after both Willem van de Velde and his son were appointed as painters to Charles II, the market in marine painting moved to London. The early marine paintings of Turner emulated those of the earlier Dutch painters such as van de Cappelle and van de Velde the younger, but Turner's more dramatic vision inspired the next generation of marine artists, and he superseded van de Velde as their model. His influence is apparent in the work of many marine artists, such as Edward William Cooke (1811\u201380), and Clarkson Stanfield (1793\u20131867), who continued to flourish in England throughout the 19th century.",
