            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nThis is an original design made by Morris in the process of working out the repeat and the colouring for the 'Acanthus' wallpaper which was produced in 1875. It is a working drawing, on the same scale as the finished wallpaper, but it does not show the whole pattern. It was intended as a guide for the printer to use when matching the colours. Pencil notes with instructions and questions about the colours have been added to the drawing by the printer.\n\nDesigns & Designing\nIn the mid-1870s Morris moved away from his earlier style of small-scale patterns. 'Acanthus' was the first wallpaper in a group of large-scale heavy patterns printed in darker colours. These designs were more sophisticated than the earlier papers, and Morris successfully disguised the underlying geometric structure of the repeat. Some of the features of the drawing, such as the white highlights on the scrolling leaf at the top, were left out of the printed version of the pattern.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe outlines were drawn in pencil and then filled in with watercolours. Morris then used an opaque white pigment to paint in the highlights. The stylised scrolling acanthus leaves were some of Morris's favourite motifs and occur regularly in his work, including his tapestries and his illuminated manuscripts.",

Veining and the use of fifteen subtly different colours (more than in any previous design) emphasise the vigour of the acanthus scrolls. A very similar conjunction of tiny background motif and scrolling leaves also appear in Morris\u2019s calligraphic and illuminated manuscripts. \n\nThe design in largely worked in watercolour and the printer would have had to interpret this in distemper \u2013 hence the colour notes on the front \u2013 including \u2018get Mr. Morris to paint in front leaves.\u2019 Notes on the back include \u2018The property of Mr. Morris 15/12/74.\u2019 \nAnother version of the design is in Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery. \n\n<i>Acanthus</i> was the first of a group of large-scale, heavily patterned and deep coloured paper: the others were <i>Pimpernel</i> (1876), <i>Wreath</i> (1876), <i>Rose</i> (1877) and <i>Chrysanthemum</i> (1877). The large size of this design requires thirty blocks to complete the pattern, making it an expensive paper costing 16s. a roll.'",
