The shape of the drinking vessel follows those made in Khorasan (now Eastern Iran and Western Afghanistan) in the 15th century (e.g., V&A:943-1886, dated 1462), but there is no foot, and the body is lower and wider.\n2. The Arabic inscription on the neck, containing good wishes for the owner, is all but identical to that on the neck of the Khorasani example dated 1462 (V&A:943-1886) and is arranged in the same way.\n3. The rest of the decoration is very different and harks back to the designs used in the 14th century.\n4. The Arabic inscription on the body is from the titles of an anonymous ruler.\n5. Compare the tinned copper drinking vessel in the State Hermitage (acc.no.VS.866; see A.A. Ivanov, \"Gruppa khorasanskikh mednykh i bronzovykh izdeleniy vtoroy poloviny XV v.\", <i>Trudy Gosudarstvennogo Ermitazha</i>, X (1969), pp.161-2, pl.6).\nOn this basis, the author ascribed the vessel to Khorasan in the last quarter of the 15th century.\nA. S. Melikian-Chirvani, <i>Islamic Metalwork from the Iranian World 8-18th Centuries</i>, London, 1982, p.255, no.113.\nMore detailed description of the decoration. Adds that\n1. The relationship between the Arabic text on the neck and that on the neck of V&A:943-1886 is even closer than previously observed, consolidating the attribution to Khorasan.\n2. The \"Jalal\" at the end of the inscription on the body can most likely be identified as the beginning of the name of a Timurid prince, Sultan Jalal al-Din Mahmud, the son of Sultan Sa'id.\nJames W. Allan, \"Metalwork of the Timurid Dynasties of Eastern Anatolia and Iran\", <i>Iran</i>, XXIX (1991), p.155, pl.XXIVa.\nRejects Melikian-Chirvani's Khorasani attribution, as a number of features relate this piece to Mamluk metalwork:\n1. The central element of the ornament of the body is a series of roundels and cartouches with round ends, all are framed by a continuous interlacing band.\n2. The Arabic inscription on the neck.\n3. The filler motifs of interlacing strapwork, Y-pattern and small arabesques.\nThe shape, which is certainly related to Khorasani pieces, and the non-Mamluk titulature show that this is not a Mamluk item, however. But the titulature is one of two Turcoman elements in the decoration:\n1. The arabesque pattern on the lower body can be compared with a pattern on the composite lamp commissioned for the tomb of Haci Bayram Veli in Ankara by Uzun Hasan Aqqoyunlu about 1470-78. This is also found in the tilework of the Blue Mosque in Tabriz.\n2. The titulature is similar to that found in longer and shorter forms over doorways in illustrations in Turcoman manuscripts, e.g. a late 15th-century copy of the <i>Divan</i> of Amir Khusraw Dihlavi in the Chester Beatty Library in Dublin.\nAllan therefore attributes the drinking vessel to Turcoman territory in the second half of the 15th century.",
