It was designed to be used at dinner as part of a matching cutlery set. Table knives became larger, with longer blades, to cut the meats and vegetables of the main courses of the meal.\n\nThe Victorian Dining Table\nFrom the 1860s Victorian society embraced the new method of serving dinner known as \u00e0 la Russe, which fundamentally changed the look of the dining table. Previously foods had been set out in silver and ceramic dishes and diners helped themselves, but with dinner \u00e0 la Russe each course was served individually to guests by servants. The silver entr\u00e9e dishes and ceramic tureens gave way to lavish floral displays in glass vases and ceramic fruit stands. The cover or place setting assumed a greater importance and occupied a larger area of the dining table. Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management advised in 1888: 'We now come to the knives and forks ... it is usual to lay two large of each, flanked to the right by a fish knife and a soup spoon, and on the left by the fish fork; other knives and forks are supplied with the plates for the different courses.'\n\nDesign & Designing\nFrom the 1840s mass-produced cutlery, machine-made in Sheffield, expanded the choice of quality and pattern for consumers. This knife was made in the popular King's pattern, but the Sheffield manufacturers James Dixon & Sons offered 28 different designs for cutlery sets in their catalogue of 1892.",

It was designed to be used at dinner as part of a matching cutlery set. Table knives became larger, with longer blades, to cut the meats and vegetables of the main courses of the meal.<br><br>\n\n<b>The Victorian Dining Table</b><br>\nFrom the 1860s Victorian society embraced the new method of serving dinner known as <i>\u00e0 la Russe</i>, which fundamentally changed the look of the dining table. Previously foods had been set out in silver and ceramic dishes and diners helped themselves, but with dinner <i> \u00e0 la Russe</i> each course was served individually to guests by servants. The silver entr\u00e9e dishes and ceramic tureens gave way to lavish floral displays in glass vases and ceramic fruit stands. The cover or place setting assumed a greater importance and occupied a larger area of the dining table. Mrs Beeton's <i>Book of Household Management</i> advised in 1888: 'We now come to the knives and forks ... it is usual to lay two large of each, flanked to the right by a fish knife and a soup spoon, and on the left by the fish fork; other knives and forks are supplied with the plates for the different courses.'<br><br>\n\n<b>Design & Designing</b><br>\nFrom the 1840s mass-produced cutlery, machine-made in Sheffield, expanded the choice of quality and pattern for consumers. This knife was made in the popular King's pattern, but the Sheffield manufacturers James Dixon & Sons offered 28 different designs for cutlery sets in their catalogue of 1892.",
