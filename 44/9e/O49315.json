The feet are brown with darker soles. The hands are red (gloves) and the face flesh coloured but flushed. The figure has a black carved and painted hat with a small brim. The face features are painted apart from the nose which is carved. The arms are articulated by means of metal pins. The figure is holding a thin metal whip in its right hand and is attached to the coach (B.61-2000) by means of reins threaded through the left hand. The metal pin that articulates the head passes through the body and portrudes from the bottom whereby the figure can be attached to the coach seat.",
