The silk is probably what was known in the 18th century as orrace tissue, one of the most expensive types of fabric with a complex woven structure including gold or silver thread. The intrinsic value of the metal used meant that its production was entrusted to only a limited number of weavers.\n\nDesign\nThe type of dense and elaborate pattern so prominent in this silk was fashionable for both furnishings and clothes in the later 1720s. Mary Delaney, a fashionable and well-connected lady, described such a silk in a letter of 1728, as having 'a running pattern like lace in the ground'.\n\nPlace\nThe silk for this canopy was supplied by George Binckes, a partner of the mercer Isaac Tullie. Their shop was at the Kings Arms and Seven Stars in Bedford Street, Covent Garden. With the later partnership of Henry Shelley, Binckes' brother-in-law, this premises remained a leading London mercer's shop for nearly 30 years.",
