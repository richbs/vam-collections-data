Four turned legs are joined by stretchers, the front and back stretchers square, the side ones rectangular. Below the drawer is a carved lower rail, and above it a plain rail. The side and back rails have a scratch moulding. The top consists of one wide and one narrow board at the back; these are pegged down into the frame and have moulded edges all round. The single drawer is of oak (except for the bottom which consists of one original wide elm board and one narrow, replaced board of softwood), with grooved sides supported on battens (one a softwood replacement) fitted into the internal frame. The back is nailed to the sides. On the front are applied mouldings, two metal knobs (replacements), an escutcheon but no lock.",
