The hands are open.\n\nThe body is constructed with a wooden shoulder yoke with hollows for the head and pelvis, and rigid stuffing.

Marionette shows were a popular form of entertainment for adults in the 19th century, many of them family concerns which travelled around the country long before the advent of film and television, presenting shortened versions of London's latest popular entertainment from melodramas and pantomimes to minstrel shows and music hall. In the 18th and early 19th centuries their theatres were relatively makeshift, but after about 1860 many became quite elaborate, with walls constructed from wooden shutters, seating made from tiered planks of wood, and canvas roofs.\n\nThe figures were carved, painted, dressed and performed by members of the company. This is Harlequin, the clever servant from the Italian knockabout comedy called 'Commedia dell'Arte'. He was a familiar character in 19th century British pantomime, where he caused fun and havoc in the harlequinade, which concluded with him marrying Columbine against the wishes of her father. Harlequin became an indispensable member of any marionette troupe along with Columbine, Clown and Pantalone.",

They began working on recreating some of the puppets' original repertoire.  Since the original cloths were too fragile for performance, new backdrops were painted, and in August 1951 as part of The Festival of Britain celebrations, the marionettes took to the stage again as The Old Time Marionettes, at the Riverside Theatre, Festival Gardens. Battersea Park.  In the 1980s George Speaight lent the troupe to puppeteers in Germany, but in the late 1990s he sold them to John Phillips, an expert puppet carver, manipulator an puppet historian, who died soon after acquiring them and whose widow sold them to the Museum after his death in 1998.",
