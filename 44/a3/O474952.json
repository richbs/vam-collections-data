However, there are no recognised centres of pottery manufacture in this area with the likelihood, therefore, that the piece was manufactured in Jaipur, where George Watts in <u>Indian Art in Delhi</u>, 1903, Calcutta, p.91,bemoaned the recent introduction of Persian models with an 'admixture of green leaves and brown and yellow flowers' as inferior to their previous blue and white productions.Yet here he is describing the the moulded and glazed  wares made of ground feldspar similar to those of Delhi, rather than thrown wares made of painted earthenware as is this piece.",
