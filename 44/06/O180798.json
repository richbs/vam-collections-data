Its first applications were commercial, but Senefelder quickly recognised its potential as a medium for fine art. This print by Fuseli comes from the first portfolio of lithographs drawn by artists which was published by Philippe Andre in England in 1803. This consisted of 12 pen lithographs by artist such as Benjamin West, James Barry and Thomas Stothard, as well as Fuseli.\n\nFuseli was a painter and draughtsman whose work was much influenced by the theatre, and was often explicitly erotic.",
