In 1897\u20138 the company designed the Passmore Edwards Settlement (now the Mary Ward Centre) in Tavistock Place in Bloomsbury, London. This was probably one of the chairs they used to furnish the building.\n\nThe chair illustrates the revival of country and crafts-inspired furniture in interiors of the time as part of the Arts and Crafts movement.  Arts and Crafts furnishings were simple and robust. They were thought particularly suitable for public interiors such as schools or 'Settlements' (centres for education and social work). They also represented highly idealistic thinking about the provision of good design for all classes of society. The firm of Heals & Co.is reputed to have made the chairs at the Passmore Edwards Settlement. It is possible that Sir Ambrose Heal may have influenced the design.",

Originally known as the Passmore Edwards Settlement and intended for social and educational use, this building was designed with a combination of residential and public spaces. The building was completed by 1899 when it featured in an article, 'The Architecture of the Passmore Edwards Settlement', by G.Ll. Morris and Esther Wood, in <u>The Studio</u>, Vol. XVI, February 1899, pp. 11-18. The armchair and chair were said, when acquired in 1962, to have been made by Heals for the Passmore Edwards Settlement. Similar pieces are visible in illustrations of the interior shown in the 1899 article but details of the original commission for the furniture has not yet been found.",
