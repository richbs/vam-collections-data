No doubt this accounted for the care taken of the doll.\nThe photograph was taken in 1886. That year the child had scarlet fever and after it her hair was cut short and kept short for 4 years. As can be seen the photo was taken before this \"operation\".\" (Letter from the donor, 1965)\n[Photograph] Studio photograph taken in 1886 by J. Russell & Sons.",
