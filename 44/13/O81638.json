Studied at Sass's art school and the RA Schools. Painted portraits, literary and historical subjects, domestic genre (often in historical costume), and rural genre scenes. Exhibited 121 works at the RA between 1839 and 1896, and 11 at the BI 1837-50. Elected ARA 1855, RA 1864. Won prizes in the competitions for the decoration of the Palace of Westminster 1843, 1844 and 1847. Some of his works were engraved; he also contributed etchings to the publications of the Etching Club and drawings to <i>Punch</i>, and in 1843 designed the first Christmas card. Associated with the artist's colony at Cranbrook, Kent, where he bought a house in 1858. At the RA, he was Rector 1875-90 (his campaign against the use of naked models in life classes earned him the soubriquet 'Clothes-Horsley'), Treasurer 1882-97, and initiator and organiser of the first Winter Exhibitions of old masters. Died Kensington, 18 October 1903. The painter Walter Charles and architect Gerald Callcott were his sons. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1857, pp181-4; <i>Illustrated London News</i> 24 October 1903, p608 (obit with photograph); J C Horsley <i>Recollections of a Royal Academican</i> 1903 (referred to below as <i>Recollections</i>); A Greg <i>The Cranbrook Colony</i> exhibition catalogue Wolverhampton Art Gallery 1977\n\n<b>The Rival Performers</b> \nFA83 Neg 59371 \nPanel, 45.7 x 40.6 cm (18 x 16 ins) \nSigned and dated 'J C Horsley/PINXIT/1839' on music sheet br \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nExhibited at the BI in 1839, the size given in the catalogue as 26 by 24 inches. According to the <i>Recollections</i>, this was the artist's first exhibited subject picture, and was bought at the BI by John Sheepshanks. \n\nThe <i>Athenaeum</i> critic described the subject: \n\n[The boy is] silenced by his sister that they may listen to a canary on the opposite wall ... There is a sweet old English quaintness - a genuine touch of Herrick's spirit - about this picture, making it attractive; but not so enchanting as to blind us to faults in its drawing, - whether in the upturned throat and bust of pretty Mistress Alice, or in the whole figure of her brother, with his very long legs and very short arms. The colouring of the flesh, too is factitious; it is pink-and-white porcelain, and not the roses and lilies of England. \n\nThe <i>Art Union</i> was more admiring, and interpreted the couple's relationship differently: \n\n[The artist] whose name is pleasantly associated with both painting and music, exhibits a picture in which he has striven to combine the interest of the two. The old poet's story of the nightingale - who strove to out-do the minstrel's song, has evidently suggested the subject ... The picture is finely conceived and very ably executed; the effect of light is very striking, but also very true; the sweet imploring look of the maiden as, with a smile of half wonder and delight, she intreats her lover to save the life of his tiny rival, by relinquishing the contest, is especially happy. \n\nThe review concluded that the work was 'one of the most agreeable pictures in the collection; and cannot but secure to the artist another step of promotion in the ranks of fame'. \n\nThe <i>Recollections</i> also note that the painting 'attracted [William] Hilton's notice, and on the varnishing day he spoke to me in the kindest way about it, and said he looked to me to be a really successful artist'. \n\nThe background setting for the picture is the alcove of the dining-room (constructed 1500-45) of Haddon Hall, Derbyshire, where Horsley had first visited and made drawings in 1835. He wrote in the <i>Recollections</i> (p102) that 'I was naturally filled with yearnings to paint pictures, in which I could use as backgrounds the ancient halls and chambers, and I dreamed many a dream of pictures to be, as I sketched diligently the beautiful scenes before me'. Horsley found Haddon Hall 'absolutely unique, and there is nothing like it in the whole world'. The <i>Art Union</i> critic (1844, p21) reviewing an engraving ( Frederick Taylor's 'Morning of the Chase-Haddon Hall in Days of Yore', wrote that the house 'has long been fertile of subject-matter to paintings in both oil and water colour, and it is precisely such a place as a lover of romance would celebrate either in painting or in narrative'. The first of a series of paintings with Haddon settings was 'Rent Day at Haddon Hall' exhibited at the BI in 1837 (182); others are 'Waiting for an Answer' (FA 82 p129), and 'Lady Jane Grey and Roger Ascham' (RA 1853, 171) which shows the same alcove. \n\nA copy in enamels of this work was exhibited by Miss Catherine Baines at the SBA in 1860 (721, present whereabouts unknown). \n\nEXH: BI 1839 (2) \n\nLIT: <i>Athenaeum</i> 9 February 1839, p117; <i>Art Union</i> 1839, p21; <i>Recollections</i> p28\"",
