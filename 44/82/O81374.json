Bequeathed by Constantine Alexander Ionides, 1900.\nPainting originally bore a false signature and date Ruisdael, 1649 which was removed when the picture was cleaned in 1909.\n\nHistorical significance: This landscape is a fine example of those painted by the Haarlem artists in the second half of the seventeenth century. Cornelis Decker is a relatively little-known Dutch landscape painter who was active in Haarlem. This work is typical of Decker's landscapes in the manner of Jacob van Ruisdael. He also imitated the style of Jan Wijnants and Philips Wouwermans.  The rickety building by a stream however is a signature of Decker's style and reappears for example in one of the two of his paintings sold at Sotheby's New York, 25 Jan. 08. The bridge is similar to the one depiced in a picture sold at Sotheby's London, July 3, 1997.",
