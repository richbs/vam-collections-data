Electroplated nickel silver, the body is a plain cylinder resting on a foot which is a flat, circular rim, the base of the body slopes downwards towards the centre. The foot rim fits snugly within the upper rim of the teapot (M.30-2001) when stacked.  The top of the body is a narrow, circular flange sloping away from the centre and slightly overlaps the side wall.  The lid is enclosed within a rim which is a plain strip of flat wire, interrupted at the rear by two lugs, at right angles to the rim holding a plain tube secured by a pin which forms the hinge of the lid.  The lid, a circular disc with a protruding flange at the rear which is soldered to the tube forming the hinge, the surface concave with a knop in the centre, a segment with a plain strip as a moulding.  A small hole to allow for escaping steam is drilled in the lid immediately behind it.  The lid and hinge is constructed so that the lid can be opened through 180\u00b0, allowing the teapot to be inverted and rest to drain and dry on a mesh rack in a hotel pantry.  The handle, \u2018D\u2019 shaped in profile is of hollow construction, rectangular in cross section and with rows of drilled holes near the two junctions with the body to facilitate heat dispersal.  The short everted spout, soldered diametrically opposite the handle to the side wall of the body, just below the rim at the front.",

The fact that it was intended for use in commercial catering, such as hotels, has strongly influenced the design. \n\nEach piece of the service stacks neatly one on top of the other so that it can be stored as one piece in the restricted space of a commercial hotel pantry. The lids swing back 180 degrees allowing the pots to drain easily when stored on drying racks. \n\nThe designer, Cyril Shiner (1908-1989), was a major British silversmith and industrial designer. He also had an excellent reputation as a gifted teacher and craftsman.",
