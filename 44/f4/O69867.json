Between his knees is the cross which rises from the base of the panel, bearing the bearded figure of Christ, his head inclined to the left, wearing the torse and a loincloth. There is no representation of the Holy Spirit. Three souls are represented by diminutive heads and shoulders in a napkin at the top of the cross. A chalice receiving the blood flowing from Christ's feet is represented at the base of the cross with two more receiving the blood from his hands at the side of the panel. The blood is represented by thin strips of alabaster. The symbols of the four evangelists are carved in the corners of the panel. At the top left, standing on a bracket, is the eagle of St. John. Opposite is a man on a bracket, representing St. Matthew. At the bottom left stands the ox of St. Luke, with the lion of St. Mark on the right. The three beasts and the man are represented as winged. They all bear scrolls, the inscriptions now lost, but they were doubtless the names of the four evangelists. \n\nThe heads of the two outer souls in the napkin are missing. The top corners of the panel are missing. Some green paint and traces of the usual daisy pattern remain on the ground. Traces of brown paint and gilding remain on the crown, hair and beard of God the Father. The back of the panel is marked in an apparently random zigzag fashion. There are three lead-plugged holes with latten wires attached. The bottom has been cut away.",
