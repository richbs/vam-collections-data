Italian goldsmiths were expert at making a little material go a very long way.  Many pieces seem too large to wear comfortably, but they are usually made of very thin gold, and are much lighter than they appear. \n\nAll Italian women wore gold earrings.  Their shapes varied widely in different places.  This earring was acquired in the Abruzzi, and was described as a bridal gift.  The Abruzzi is a remote and mountainous area of central Italy, and traditional jewellery survived there longer than in many other parts of the country.  It was formerly part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, and the jewellery is often different from that found elsewhere in northern and central Italy.\n\nIt was bought as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
