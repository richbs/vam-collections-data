The back is fitted to the figure and has a concave waist seam. The skirt is pleated to the bodice with small flat pleats alternating with narrower ones. On either side is stitched a self-covered button. The skirt opening is trimmed with a band of pleated silk net edged and bound with silk ribbon. The sleeves are shaped to the elbow and are bound with the same. There are stitch marks which suggest that there was a similar net trimming now removed. The bodice is lined with white glazed linen. There are tapes at either side of the waist and another tape stitched two-thirds of the way down the skirt seams, possibly for looping up. The hem is faced back with white silk.\n\nThe petticoat is of matching material. It is curved to the waist, flat pleated and fastens at the hip with a white metal hook and eye. A wide pleated ribbon bound flounce of net, like that on the bodice, trims it above the hem. The skirt is faced back at the hem with white silk and bound at the waist with white tape.",
