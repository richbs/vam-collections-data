She carefully collected a wide range of items relating to her career including posters, playbills, newspaper cuttings, hooks and pulleys, printing blocks and costume.  Born in Suffolk, England, Pansy Chinery began her career with The Zedora Sisters, billed as Alar the Flying Arrow. The troupe went on tour with Barnum and Bailey's Circus for their 1897 tour, when she was shot from a giant crossbow high above the circus ring.\n\nLater she performed on the variety stage, touring mostly in England with troupes called The Mars Trio, Leighton & Lindford, and Ritz and Ritz and The Uniques, specialising in comic acrobatic and gymnastic acts. Like all popular variety acts in the early 19th century, the troupes had a gruelling schedule, appearing widely in variety theatres across the country.  They were usually booked at each theatre for a week, and travelled on Sundays.",
