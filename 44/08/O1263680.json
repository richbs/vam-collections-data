Punch and Judy shows are a feature of British seaside  entertainment whose history in Great Britain stretches back to the puppet show that Samuel  Pepys noted seeing in Covent Garden on 9 May 1662 performed by the Italian puppeteer Signor  Bologna. This included a marionette, or string puppet as Pulcinello or Punch, but by the 19th century Punch was more usually a glove puppet, performed in a portable booth by one performer who had a character on each hand.\n\nPunch became a popular character in Britain by the 19th century, when images of Punch and Judy were used as decorative motifs on a range of household items. In 1841 the magazine Punch, or the London Charivari was established, named after the comic and anarchic character of Mr. Punch whose image appeared on its cover.",
