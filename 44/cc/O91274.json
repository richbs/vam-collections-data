This made possible a new type of candid snapshot. With his camera disguised as a leather box, Paul Martin--a wood engraver by training--made his photographs on London streets and while on holiday at the seaside. His negatives were the same size as this print and made on a platinum paper prized for its subtle tonal range. Martin's work demonstrates that by the end of the 19th century photography was no longer the preserve of aristocratic amateurs and professional studios. Anyone could now make snapshots of their life and surroundings. Martin was one of the last wood engravers and one of the first photojournalists.",
