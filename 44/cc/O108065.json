In 1864, frustrated by a lack of communication from Queen Victoria\u2019s government, Tewodros took a number of Europeans captive, including the British consul, Captain Cameron. The British response was a military expedition of huge complexity and expense led by Sir Robert Napier. The expedition marched to Tewodros\u2019s fortress at Maqdala where a brief battle took place. Britain won the conflict, but not before the captives were released and Tewodros himself had committed suicide.\n\nContemporary reports record that the widowed Queen expressed a wish to \u2018be escorted as far as her native province of Semyen, in the north-west part of Tigreh [but] \u2026 when the head-quarters\u2019 camp reached Aikhullet, on May 15 [1868], this poor lady died\u2019, apparently of lung disease. \u2018Her funeral took place next morning in the great church at Chelicut \u2026 The women of her household, showing her robe, her ornaments, her slippers and her drinking cup, beat their breasts, tore their hair, and scratched their cheeks, shedding tears of real grief as they bewailed her death\u2019 (Illustrated London News, 1868). An inventory of the Queen\u2019s possessions includes mention of a \u2018pair bracelets silver\u2019. These possessions were sent on to the Secretary of State for India at the India Office, London, and given to the South Kensington (later V&A) Museum the following year.",
