He had purchased them from the Maharaja of Jaipur in Rajasthan, and it is probable that this example was made in the royal workshops in Jaipur, in the early 19th century. Jaipur was, and still is, famous for its translucent enamels of extremely high quality. The form, and design in which a peacock predominates, are extremely unusual. It is possible that the ornament was made to adorn an image of the Hindu deity Krishna, with whom the peacock is associated, rather than for the ruler to wear as the traditional emblem of royalty. Paintings of the God also often depict him wearing ornaments of precisely this form.",
