Such sumptuous pieces were often commissioned as acts of merit by royalty or wealthy personages and given to the monkhood. Unusually this hpaya khan rests on its own sadaik (manuscript box) which has a door at the back for access to the manuscripts. The virtuoso carving of Burmese foliate designs and mythical creatures seen on this hpaya khan has been embellished with thayo, or moulded lacquer, encrusted with glass inlay work. A technique which grew in popularity in Burma from the middle of the 18th century and is thought to have been introduced from Thailand.",
