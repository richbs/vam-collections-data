            "public_access_description": "This bowl is an example of a type of ceramic that became very popular under the Ilkhanids. It is known as 'Sultanabad ware' after the place it was first found. However, these wares were probably made at Kashan - the main centre of pottery production in Iran before the Mongol invasions of the early 13th century, which continued to operate during the Ilkhanid period (1256-1353).\n\nThe Mongol invasions created a close link between the Middle East and China as both regions came to be ruled by the Mongol viceroys. In China this was known as the Yuan dynasty. These dynasties maintained close cultural links with each other through trade, by sea and land, along the silk route. This created a flow of many new artistic motifs from China into the Middle East such as the dragon, the phoenix and the lotus blossom.\n\nThe bowl represents some of the characteristics of Ilkhanid wares that are attributed to Sultanabad. Such is the decoration in slip painting that covers interior and exterior except for the low foot. Black is used for the outlines of the decoration. The lobed shape of the bowl copies Chinese bowls which were imported in large numbers at this time. Single animals in a densely foliated background, like the present bowl, were a popular subject during the Ilkhanid period.",
