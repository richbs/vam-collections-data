John Gielgud saw his work and invited Andreu to create the costumes and settings for Much Ado About Nothing at Stratford-upon-Avon in 1949.  The production was a great success and was toured and revived in Stratford and London. Andreu went on to design a number of productions in Britain during the 1950s, including Hamlet with Alec Guinness as the Prince at the New Theatre, London, and Berlioz's opera The Trojans at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden.\n\nAll Well That Ends Well was directed by Noel Willman, with Joyce Redman as Helena, Rosalind Atkinson as the Countess and Michael Denison as Bertram. The costume shown in this design was worn by Ann Firbank. Theatre critic Ivor Brown, summing up the production in a published photographic record of the 1954 - 1956 Stratford seasons, called Andreu's  designs 'sumptuous in the Caroline manner: if play and performance were not always a satisfaction to the ear and mind, the eye was constantly gratified by a pageant of cavaliers'.",
