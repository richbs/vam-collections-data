He wears a hat with an upturned brim, and carries a closed book in his left hand. A satchel hangs at his left side from a strap over his right shoulder. He is barefooted.\n\nThe top of the panel has been broken off. The right side of the panel is chipped. The saint's right hand and the staff are missing. The very slightest traces of the usual daisy pattern remain at the bottom of the panel. There are traces of red on the folds of the saint's cloak, and traces of gilding on his hair and beard on the background and on the canopy. The back of the panel bears two lead-plugged holes, one with a latten wire attached.",

He wears a hat with an upturned brim and carries a closed book in his left hand. A satchel hangs at his left side from a strap over his right shoulder. \n\nSaints are the heroes and heroines of Christian faith. In the 14th and 15th centuries, they were a popular subject for alabaster carvings. Religious themes penetrated private life, so devotional images of saints were sculpted not only for church interiors, but also for individuals to contemplate within the privacy of their homes.",
