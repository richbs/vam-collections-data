The earliest playbills were handwritten, but since many were illiterate, publicity was also announced by word of mouth.  By 1700 bills were usually printed, although they did not give the year until the 1760s.  Despite the handwritten note dating this to 1725, the correct date is 1718.  In addition to the smaller bill, larger posters were printed nearer the performance date, a fact indicated by the words: 'as will be express'd in the Great Bill'\n\nThe bill advertises a Benefit performance for Margaret Saunders (1686-c.1745), an actress whose illness forced her early retirement in 1721.  She was renowned for her lively portrayal of chambermaids - hence the choice of a popular comedy by Beaumont and Fletcher, which would have enabled her to show her talents to the full.  As beneficiary she would have been entitled to the proceeds of the performance, less the house charges of \u00a340 or more.  She could have earned perhaps twice that amount if the house were full, and she would have tried to sell as many tickets as possible.  The bill shows that the performance began at 6pm, the usual starting time for the theatre during much of the 18th century.",
