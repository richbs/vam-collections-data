It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years. Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nLa Poup\u00e9e, the comic opera by Arthur Sturgess with music by Edmond Audran, was first produced in London in 1897. Jean Colin, an actress and singer, played Alesia in the Daly's Theatre production which opened in December 1931 and toured in 1932. She had made her first stage appearance at the Grand Theatre Brighton in 1923 as a dancer in the pantomime Cinderella and went on to appear regularly in pantomime. She also specialised in musical comedy, playing the title role in San Toy and Sally in Miss Hook of Holland, both at Daly's Theatre in 1931.",
