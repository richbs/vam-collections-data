In 1868 it was taken by British troops at the siege of Magdala (Mek'dala). The same year, the Lords of the Admiralty placed it on loan at the South Kensington Museum (later renamed the Victoria and Albert Museum).\n\nThe Ethiopian church was part of the Coptic church until 1959, when it became fully independent.",

The earliest eastern churches were established in Antioch, Alexandria and other cities in the 1st century. They were independent communities and theological controversy sharpened their differences.  \n\nIn 330 Constantinople (now Istanbul) became the capital of the Roman empire. Successive bishops of Constantinople, later given the title of patriarch, gradually won authority over other eastern churches, despite the opposition of the pope. Churches that accepted the jurisdiction of the patriarch became known as Orthodox, but others, including those of Armenia and Ethiopia, developed along separate lines. Diversity of practice and doctrine in the eastern churches is reflected in the different kinds of regalia and sacred silver. Yet some forms such as the chalice are common to all, indicating a shared core of beliefs.",
