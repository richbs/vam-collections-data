Another type of sock for warmer weather was shorter, embroidered or plain in blue or white silk or cotton. The were worn with shoes and pulled over the hem of the trousers. \n\nLengths of tightly woven silk about 8 cm wide and 85-120 cm long, often with silken fringes at each end, were used as puttees and wound spirally around the leg from ankle to knee, over the trousers and socks, for protection or support. They were useful for cushioning the knees when required to perform the full kowtow. \" (Garrett, 134-135)",
