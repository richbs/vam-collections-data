This is reflected in their free, abstract and semi-abstract designs.\n\nThe group\u2019s t-shirt designs were very successful, and were sold on the high street in shops like Marks and Spencer and Scotch House.  The Cloth were even asked to design a t-shirt for the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games. The design printed on this t-shirt is by Keith Haring, the American artist and activist, known for his graffiti style referencing 1980s New York street culture that conveyed messages about sexuality, life and death. The abstracted dancing figure shown on this particular t-shirt is very painterly in style. The printed \u2018paint\u2019 trails which \u2018run\u2019 down the figure\u2019s body evoke the sweat and heightened excitement of the nightclub or warehouse party. The boldness and freedom of the image would have appealed to the rave scene, which was then in its infancy.",
