Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. Above all they had to have the means of attaching the cord. In this example, there are a pair of holes (himotoshi) on the bottom of the sandal.  Although netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated is the katabori (shape carving). This is a three-dimensional carving, such as this netsuke of an oni (demon) on a tattered hat.\n\nBoth wood and ivory were traditionally the most widely used materials for making netsuke. This example is carved from ivory, which was an expensive luxury material. At the time this netsuke was carved, only ivory from the Indian elephant was used and was imported by Chinese and Dutch traders. \nFrom the 18th century onwards, many more makers signed their netsukes. This example is signed Masatsugu and depicts the animated form of a demon crawling over a tattered hat, perhaps belonging to a farmer or a pilgrim. The demon's mischievous expression illustrates the oni's playful and troublesome nature. This netsuke is skillfully carved with the smooth contours of the demon's body neatly contrasting with the woven form of the hat.",
