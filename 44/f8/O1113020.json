They were brothers who acquired the freehold of the Lyceum Theatre in 1909 and ran it until the death of Walter Melville in 1937.\n\nWritten by Percy Gordon Holmes, A Night of Temptationstarred Dennis Neilson-Terry as Paul Azario, and Violet Farebrother as Queen Catherine. The play featured an unlikely plot, but lots of dramatic action and love interest, and four acts of lavish scenery and costumes. As one reviewer wrote: 'it is a spirited piece, although it strains credulity to the breaking point.' A poster like this, illustrated with photographs of scenes from the play, was an excellent marketing device showing graphically the size of the cast and indicating the breath-taking, cliff-hanging moments the author intended.",
