All of them are sewn on to a band of faded red cotton, to which are attached tapes for tying. The wide panels are lined with red silk damask of stylised floral design, and edged with black satin, with a border of black satin embroidered with flowers and scrolls in blue and white silks and silver-gild thread, with an inner border of a narrow woven braid. \n\nFive of these panels are edged at the bottom with knotted fringe of green silk, from which hang yellow silk tassels with red and green bobbles. Each of the narrow panels is lined with satin of the same colour as the front, edged with black satin, and with an inner border of narrow woven braid. From all the pales hang small metal bells.\n\nAll the panels embroidered with coloured silks and silver-gilt thread in long and short, satin and knot stitches and couched work. Two panels are decorated with peonies and other flowers growing from rocks, with flowers and butterflies above. Two panels with lotus growing from a pool in which fish are swimming, prunus blossom and butterflies above. One panel is decorated with a five-clawed, front facing dragon amidst clouds, bats, and the Eight Buddhist symbols, with waves below, and another panel with a long tailed bird (possibly a phoenix) on an rock above waves, with peony, magnolia and other flowers, another bird and clouds above. \n\nThe narrow panels are embroidered with flowers and butterflies. Each one has a single flower spray embroidered on the back - lotus on the yellow, chrysanthemum on the pale blue and peony on the darker blue.",
