Napper left in 1898 to work on a freelance basis. Absorbing the most fashionable elements of British and Continental design at the end of the 19th century, Napper produced a range of very successful stylised floral designs. He sold to many manufacturers, including G. P. & J. Baker and his textiles were particularly popular in France.\n\nGeorge Percival and James Baker were brothers who founded the printed fabric manufacturers G. P. & J. Baker. They bought work from the leading designers of the turn of the 19th century, including Voysey, Butterfield and the Silver Studio. These designs were characterised by highly original floral patterns. The firm became contract printers to many popular shops such as Liberty & Co.  \n\nLiberty & Co., founded in 1875, was one of the most fashionable shops in London.  The business started by importing Eastern goods and exhibiting historic textiles, but by the late 1880s was purchasing furnishing patterns from top contemporary British designers and manufacturers. Liberty sold British textiles in Europe and had a branch in Paris.",
