The text is as follows: FLORENCE: late 16th century 457 Sketch designs for an octagonal ceiling and various entablatures Three of the friezes are inscribed 'Antonius' and two of them 'Ant'; inscribed on the back in pencil in a modern hand 'A. di Sangallo' Partly in red chalk; and partly in pen and ink wash over red chalk ; on two rectangular sheets joined 16 x 10 \u00bd (406 x 267) 2265 PROVENANCE Sir T. Lawernce; S. Woodburn (sale, Sotheby, 4-14 June 1860, unidentified lot ; bought for the Museum) The drawing was ascribed tp Antpnio da Sangallo when it entered the Museum, the name being suggested presumably by the inscriptions in the friezes. The ornament, however, has a pronounced mannerist character and must be later than 1534, when Sangallo died.",
