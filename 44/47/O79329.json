They were particularly renowned for the quality of their filigree work, which was worn and appreciated as much by Muslim as by Jewish women.\n\nThis pendant was one of a pair made to hang either side of the face like earrings.  The hook at the top shows that it was meant to be fastened to the head covering, not directly into the ear itself.  The long intricate pendants are typical of Yemeni jewellery, and are also often found on necklaces.",
