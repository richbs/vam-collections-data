The front shows Goldilocks wearing a purple jacket, green skirt, and white blouse and petticoat, and tasting the Three Bears' porridge.   The inside shows the Three Bears as anthropomorphic characters, looking at the table and chairs where the porridge is laid out; the wording reads \nTO-DAY YOU'RE 2\nwith the figure two in gold foil embossed with toy animals.  The numeral is attached to a pull-out tab which shows an anthropomorphic bear cub about to cut a birthday cake with a jack-in-the-box in its centre; there is also a verse which reads:\n\"Our porridge has gone !\" The Three Bears shout,\n\"For Goldi-locks we'll now look out !\nBut whilst we're looking we've time to say:\nBEST BIRTHDAY WISHES TO YOU TO-DAY !\"",
