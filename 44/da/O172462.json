Like Catholic women elsewhere in southern Europe they often wore elaborate crosses as jewellery.\n\nThe design of this cross is based on 18th century aristocratic jewellery, but the use of facetted decoration in imitation of diamonds is typical of 19th century traditional jewellery.  Crosses like this were worn mainly in the north-west of Italy.  It is much heavier and more expensive than those worn further south.  Its original owner would have worn it hung from a ribbon, passed through the loop at the back of the bow at the top.  \n\nThis cross was bought for \u00a36 as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
