Every year from 1987 to 2006, while David Watkins was Professor of Goldsmithing, Silversmithing, Metalwork and Jewellery at the RCA, he invited four jewellers and silversmiths from outside Britain to give a week-long masterclass. The artists brought diverse skills, aesthetics and approaches. The first call on their time was to interact closely with the students. In addition, although concentrating on their teaching and working in an unfamiliar studio, each artist generously made an object for the RCA's collection. The Royal College of Art Visiting Artists Collection, now transferred to the V&A, is a major document of international contemporary jewellery, a tribute both to the artists and to the vibrancy of the RCA as a teaching institution.\n\nJewellers of the late 20th century found new ways of drawing out gold's natural beauty. By exploring surface treatments and textures they created an effect very different from the bright metallic glint of polished gold. They restored an elemental simplicity and grandeur to this most enduring of metals.\n\nA stark effect is achieved in the minimalist geometry of Graziano Visintin\u2019s jewellery. Narrow facets with minimal volume, as seen here, are typical of his designs. These narrow segments form the basic elements of his compositions. The severity is tempered by a fine texturing of the gold surfaces. \n\nVisintin studied at the State Institute of Art \u2018Pietro Selvatico\u2019 in Padua, under Giampaolo Babetto.",
