Features in very delicate stipple of brown, sanguine, yellow and blue, blended into smooth gouache over a warm carnation ground; the hair in pale brown wash, lined with darker colour and with broad, soft gouache lights; the dress in opaque blue wash, modelled with hatching in darker colour and with the lights in white; cuff of the chemise in very pale brown wash modelled and heightened in white; flowers and shawl in transparent washes, hatched with darker colour and with the lights partly taken out and partly done in white; the jewellery picked out with metallic silver and the pearls in white over pale brown wash; background in brown wash hatched in darker colour for the shaded area; on vellum put down on a leaf from a table-book.  \n \n<u>Frame:</u> A late nineteenth-century gilt-brass, oval composite frame, the outer rim sloping up to a deep channel which is filled by a milled half-round fillet in the middle, then descending in a concave slope with a cast and chased rose-and-tulip motif repeating with scrolling foliate ornament; the inner ring soldered to the outer, composed of a plain concave border surrounding a narrow field with a repeated palm motif. The latter constitutes the rebate, which holds a shallowly convex glass; a simple brass ring soldered to the back at the top, with a ring-hanger fitted to it; the whole push-fitted to a heavy, plain oval box back, constructed to fit into a velvet-covered cushion mount in a larger frame, which is missing.",

Full Citation: \n \n\"<b>28 Catherine Howard, Lady d' Aubigny, and later Lady Newburgh</b> \n(d.1650) \n<B>1638-40</b> \nP157-1910 \n\n<b>Oval 104 x 86 mm</b> \n\nFeatures in very delicate stipple of brown, sanguine, yellow and blue, blended into smooth gouache over a warm carnation ground; the hair in pale brown wash, lined with darker colour and with broad, soft gouache lights; the dress in opaque blue wash, modelled with hatching in darker colour and with the lights in white; cuff of the chemise in very pale brown wash modelled and heightened in white; flowers and shawl in transparent washes, hatched with darker colour and with the lights partly taken out and partly done in white; the jewellery picked out with metallic silver and the pearls in white over pale brown wash; background in brown wash hatched in darker colour for the shaded area; on vellum put down on a leaf from a table-book. \n\n<b>Condition:</b> Some retouches in zinc-white in the face and bosom; the silver blackened; some flaking in the impasted white of the cuff and flowers; fading of the flesh; but substantially intact.  \n \n<b>Signed:</b> Not Signed. Inscribed on the back in graphite by a late nineteenth-century hand: <i>2/Richmond</i>.  \n \n<b>Frame:</b> A late nineteenth-century gilt-brass, oval composite frame, the outer rim sloping up to a deep channel which is filled by a milled half-round fillet in the middle, then descending in a concave slope with a cast and chased rose-and-tulip motif repeating with scrolling foliate ornament; the inner ring soldered to the outer, composed of a plain concave border surrounding a narrow field with a repeated palm motif. The latter constitutes the rebate, which holds a shallowly convex glass; a simple brass ring soldered to the back at the top, with a ring-hanger fitted to it; the whole push-fitted to a heavy, plain oval box back, constructed to fit into a velvet-covered cushion mount in a larger frame, which is missing.  \n \n<b>Provenance:</b> said by Pfungst (1) to have been sold from the Royal Collection at Windsor; acquired from an unknown source by George Salting (no. 4675), and by him bequeathed to the Museum, 1910.(2)  \n \n<b>Literature:</b> <i>Salting Collection</i>, 1911, p. 46  (after Van Dyck, probably by Jean Petitot'), Foster 1911; Long 1930, p. 56 (as Petitot, citing an 'exactly similar enamel'); <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981 , p. 70 (Anon., French seventeenth century).  \n \nA copy after the Van Dyck Catherine Howard, painted probably at the time of her marriage to Lord d'Aubigny in 1638, now in the National Gallery, Washington. The picture (Lady O'Bignie, the pair to Lord O'Bignie,) was bequeathed by Frances Theresa Stuart (La Belle Stuart, 1647-1702), the Dowager Duchess of Richmond and Lennox and daughter-in-law of the sitter, to Catherine nee O'Brien, 8th Baroness Clifton of Leighton Bromswold in her own right, and wife of Edward Hyde, later 3rd Earl of Clarendon. The picture remained at The Grove, the Clarendon house in Hertfordshire, until its sale to PAB Widener early in the present century.  \n \nThe miniature had been attributed to Petitot while it belonged to Salting, but the fact that he did not know any other portraits by Petitot in this medium or format made Long initially cautious of accepting it on these grounds. In 1922, however, Erik Hasselbalch of Copenhagen brought to the Museum an enamel of the same subject, signed by Petitot and dated 1643. (3) This convinced Long, and his entry in the <i>Handlist</i> of 1930 accordingly expressed no reservations; in a note on the file, he even wondered whether the miniature might have been the actual model by Petitot for the production of the enamel.  \n \nThat it, rather than the Van Dyck, was the direct source of the enamel is of course, possible, whoever the miniature is by. But, in terms of technique, it is extremely difficult to see this as anything but an English miniature. On the simplest level of limning technique, the nature of the carnation ground, the way of painting the jewels, and even the use of a table-book leaf as secondary support are characteristically English. Furthermore, as a realised object, the miniature would be very exceptional if not unique in a French context, but it is of a familiar type in England in the 1630s. It relates naturally to the class of fine copies after Van Dyck, often unsigned as here, but either by John Hoskins himself or by artists closely associated with him. Of those certainly by Hoskins, Cat. Nos 27 and 29, together with images of Henrietta Maria from the early 1630s (4) and of the Countess of Dorset, c.1638 (5) are clearly comparable. Other miniatures have been attributed elsewhere, such as the Mary Duchess of Richmond and Lennox, attributed by Goulding to Samuel Cooper (6) but by Graham Reynolds to Hoskins.(7) The latter, which derives from the Van Dyck portrait of the Duchess as St Agnes at Windsor (8) so gives rise to a Petitot enamel, signed and dated 1643.(9)  \n \nIn this context, this miniature emerges as completely at home, both in terms of the self-assurance of the handling and in the actual technique. This is the polychrome stipple of the elder Hoskins at its best - soft and almost amorous in its dwelling on the tone and texture of the skin. The isolation of the miniature from display alongside its peer-group and its relegation to a drawer of miscellaneous Continental limnings and enamels in the Museum's reserve collection have inhibited appreciation of its quality, so that it has not previously been considered with the best work by Hoskins. Once the comparisons are made, however, its technical qualities seem conclusive in pointing to Hoskins as the author.  \n \nI In conversation with Long, MS note in Museum file. \n2 Salting Collection, no. 4675. \n3 Now in the Musee d' Art et d'Histoire, Geneva. \n4 Mauritshuis, Devonshire, Beauchamp and Northumberland Collections; Murdoch 1981, figs. 109-13. \n5 BuccleuchCollection;Murdoch 1981, fig.114. \n6 WelbeckAbbey; Goulding 1914-16, no. 72, pl.
