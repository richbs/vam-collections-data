The body is made of the mineral serpentine, the name of which is perhaps taken from its resemblance to snake skin. It is set as a tankard in silver-gilt mounts.\n\nMaterials & Making\nSerpentine is often variegated in colour, and can range from a pale greenish or yellow to a rich red or brown through to a deep green. Although commonly called a marble, serpentine is a relatively soft material, and can be turned on a lathe. From the 16th century there was a thriving mining industry in Saxony, Germany, which produced large numbers of serpentine vessels for export. These were deliberately turned with small protrusions to hold the decorative mounts. The serpentine vessels for export were primarily tankards of standard sizes and shapes, and 'mazers' or bowls. These were fitted with silver or silver-gilt mounts by goldsmiths in such trading cities as London, Norwich and York.\n\nOwnership & Use\nFrom the mid-16th century such exotic materials as horn, glass, alabaster and marble often replaced the traditional use of metal for personal drinking vessels. By the 1630s in England the tankard was no longer in fashion in court circles because its use was widespread throughout society. Its shape and mounts subsequently became simplified and standardised.",
