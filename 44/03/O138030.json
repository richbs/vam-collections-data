Sk\u00e5ne province, in the extreme south of Sweden, has the richest tradition, and more jewellery was worn there than in any other district.   Almost all the Swedish traditional jewellery at the V&A comes from Sk\u00e5ne.  \n\nCircular and heart-shaped ring brooches are medieval in origin and found throughout northern Europe.  They differ from modern brooches in the way they fasten.  The wearer pulls the cloth of the garment through the central hole, and then spears it with the pin.  The greater the strain on the pin, the more secure the fastening.\n\nThis ring brooch is a plain circle decorated with filigree coil rings, each topped with a small lozenge alternating with a granule.  This kind of decoration is typical of Sk\u00e5ne work in the first half of the 19th century, as is the little ring holding the pin.  The brooch was made to hold a woman\u2019s shirt closed at the collar.  It is marked with the maker\u2019s mark EH.  Erik Holmberg was a silversmith who specialised in traditional jewellery, who worked in Lund from 1774-1819.  After his death, his widow continued his business, using his maker\u2019s mark, for another twenty years.  From the style of the brooch, it is more likely to date from her time than from his.",
