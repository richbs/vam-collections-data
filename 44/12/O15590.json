It has just three seams - two along the sleeves and one down the centre back. It drapes and flows around the body from tight gathers at the high round neck which has a deep double ruffle collar in pleated organdie. Frills in the same organdie decorate the hem and sleeve edges. The crisp, stiff pleats are set against the soft and clinging jersey. The cloak fastens at the neck with a hook and eye and falls open at the front. It has the label 'Yuki London'.",

He studied at the London College of Fashion and gained design experience at leading houses, including Hartnell and Cardin. Yuki launched his own label in London in 1972 and quickly built up an international reputation for his fluid, draped, jersey garments. His designs have always been body-conscious, and he is admired both for his craftmanship and for the fact that his designs suit larger as well as smaller women.",
