            "public_access_description": "Watcombe Pottery were proud of their fine red clay and specialised in clean, classical shapes.  This suited Dresser's own interest in strong forms.  This jug with two beakers and matching tray (Museum numbers C.59A to C-1980) is sometimes described as a lemonade set although its exact purpose is unknown. Watcombe Pottery was established in about 1870 following the discovery of a bed of fine red clay at Watcombe House, Teignmouth Road, St Mary Church, north of Torquay.   There is no documentary evidence of Dresser's collaboration with Watcombe but it is usually accepted on stylistic grounds. Dresser visited Japan on several occasions and in 1877 presented the Emperor with European artefacts including one example of Watcombe pottery. A number of potteries grew up or turned to art pottery in the west of England in the 1870s and 1880s.  Their reliance on the distinctive local red clay makes their production recognisable as coming from Devon or Somerset. The design of the jug in this set closely resembles one registered by Watcombe in 1872. Documentary evidence is lacking, but it is assumed that Dresser designed for the pottery from about this time.",

While there is no direct parallel to these forms in Japanese art, it was Dresser's consuming interest in the art and aesthetics of Japan, coupled with his own concerns as a designer for the function of the object and the techniques of mass production, which would inspire work such as this.",
