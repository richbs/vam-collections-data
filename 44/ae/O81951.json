Features finely hatched in brown and sanguine, with blue-grey for the shadows and some white heightening, blended into a pale carnation ground; hair in brown wash, hatched and lined with darker colour and with grey-brown for the lights, only partly over the carnation; collar in white and grey-blue over pale grey wash; armour in grey wash hatched over with darker colour and with white for the lights and gold for the studs; sky in washes of grey-blue and white; almost transparent to the left; on vellum put down on pasteboard. \n\n<u>Frame:</u> Probably eighteenth-century oval locket; the convex back of copper-gilt; the sides of gold with two narrow channels separated by a thread moulding, holding the back and the convex glass in bezels; the hanger engraved with a thread line and pivoted transversely by a steel screw (possibly a later addition) on to a small drilled button soldered to the top. The inside packed out with an oval brass plate and cut playing cards. 'The locket is not of the conventional miniature type, but seems to be adapted from a watch-case pattern: the back which is removable rather than the front, and the hanger, of bow and pendant type, are characteristic of watch-making practice c.1750.",

Full citation:\n\n\u201c<b>Unknown Man 1660-70</b>\u201d\nP23-1977 \n\n<b>Oval 50 x 41.5</b> <b>mm\n</b>\nFeatures finely hatched in brown and sanguine, with blue-grey for the shadows and some white heightening, blended into a pale carnation ground; hair in brown wash, hatched and lined with darker colour and with grey-brown for the lights, only partly over the carnation; collar in white and grey-blue over pale grey wash; armour in grey wash hatched over with darker colour and with white for the lights and gold for the studs; sky in washes of grey-blue and white; almost transparent to the left; on vellum put down on pasteboard. \n\n<b>Condition:</b> Good unfaded condition.\n\n<b>Signed:</b> Not signed. \n\n<b>Frame:</b> Probably eighteenth-century oval locket; the convex back of copper-gilt; the sides of gold with two narrow channels separated by a thread moulding, holding the back and the convex glass in bezels; the hanger engraved with a thread line and pivoted transversely by a steel screw (possibly a later addition) on to a small drilled button soldered to the top. The inside packed out with an oval brass plate and cut playing cards. 'The locket is not of the conventional miniature type, but seems to be adapted from a watch-case pattern: the back which is removable rather than the front, and the hanger, of bow and pendant type, are characteristic of watch-making practice c.1750.' (1)\n\n<b>Provenance:</b> From the collection of Mrs Clement Williams; presented to the Museum by her daughters Mrs A Edwards and Mrs BJ Day, June 1977. \n\n<b>Exhibited:</b> <i>Objects: The V&A Collects 1974-8</i>, May-August 1978 (unnumbered and uncatalogued) . \n\n<b>Literature:</b> <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 16 (erroneously as the gift of R Bayne-Powell). \n\nThe tentative attribution to Dixon which accompanied the miniature on its receipt at the Museum seems acceptable. The style is closely comparable with that of Cat. No.155 [Evans 34], similarly an early work of the 1660s. Stylistically the miniature shows Dixon close to Cooper at this date, blending the hatched strokes of brown and sanguine with gouache into the carnation ground, and using a low viewpoint against the sky background to create a sense of space around the figure. The use of pasteboard support for the vellum is less frequent in English miniatures of this date, but it occurs also in the signed Dixon miniature Cat. No.157 [217-1906] and in the unsigned Cat. No.156 [P.119-1910]. \n\n1 Richard Edgecumbe, personal communication, 1992.\" ",
