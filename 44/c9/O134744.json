The V&A work is also very close to two portraits of a woman, each of which has a male portrait pendant, now in private collections.  This suggests that the painting may originally have had a male pendant or that it is a 'tronie', a picture painted from a living model but intended as a study of costume or expression rather than as a portrait.  Such paintings were common in 17th century Dutch art and, as well as being used by artists as compositional aids, were made for and sold on the open market.",

He was back in Haarlem in 1583, when he painted a group portrait there and was subsequently associated with van Mander and Hendrick Goltzius in forming an 'academy to study from the life'. He continued to live at Haarlem and died there in 1638. \nHis paintings, which include religious and mythological subjects as well as portraits, are strongly influenced by Italian Mannerism. \n \n<i>Lit.</i>F.

The V&A work is also very close to two portraits of a woman, each of which has a male portrait pendant, now in private collections (repro. No. 340 a-b and 341a-b, van Thiel).  This suggests that the painting may originally have had a male pendant or that it is a 'tronie', a picture painted from a living model but intended as a study of costume or expression rather than as a portrait.  Such paintings were common in 17th century Dutch art and, as well as being used by artists as compositional aids, were made for and sold on the open market.",

He used it both in small-scale portrait studies and in larger compositions.  This may be one of his 'tronies' .interesting, fantasized heads, usually made as independent works of art, but sometimes also as working material.  As products of his imagination they belong, unlike his portraits, to the domain of invention, of history painting. A similar use of tronies is described by Karel van Mander in his biography of Frans Floris, where he describes how this master tended to block in a composition with chalk, ordering his pupils to continue towkring on it with instructions to \u2018put in these or those heads\u2019 , because, as Van Mander explains, \u2018he always had a good few of those to hand on panels.\u2019 [Eng tran from Miedema 1994-, vol.

He never copied models exactly; he always adapted them to the situation in which they were needed.  \n\nSee van Thiel monograph, p. 106ff.",
