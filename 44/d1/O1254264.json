It comprised 25 sketches, topical skits and dance routines, and included choreography by Fred Astaire who was working in London's Shaftesbury Theatre with his sister Adele at the time. Astaire taught Coward tap-dancing at the nearby Guildhall School of Music for the production, which was famous for the shadow-dance sequence with which it opened. \n\nGertrude Lawrence, already famous as the West End's leading lady, made her singing debut in London Calling!, and her appearance in it cemented an association with Noel Coward's work that continued throughout their careers. The cast also included the 21 year old identical twins, the dancing double act The Dolores Sisters, who kept this poster as a souvenir.",
