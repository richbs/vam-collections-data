            "public_access_description": "This piece is part of the Royal College of Art Visiting Artists Collection. Every year from 1987 to 2006, while David Watkins was Professor of Goldsmithing, Silversmithing, Metalwork and Jewellery at the RCA, he invited four jewellers and silversmiths from outside Britain to give a week-long masterclass. The artists brought diverse skills, aesthetics and approaches. The first call on their time was to interact closely with the students. In addition, although concentrating on their teaching and working in an unfamiliar studio, each artist generously made an object for the RCA's collection. The Royal College of Art Visiting Artists Collection, now transferred to the V&A, is a major document of international contemporary jewellery, a tribute both to the artists and to the vibrancy of the RCA as a teaching institution.\n\nJewellers of the late 20th century found new ways of drawing out gold's natural beauty. By exploring surface treatments and textures they created an effect very different from the bright metallic glint of polished gold. They restored an elemental simplicity and grandeur to this most enduring of metals.\n\nManfred Bischoff  uses a matt gold finish in contrast with the traditional polished surfaces of commercial jewellery. His pieces are like miniature sculptures, and almost surreal or ethereal. The viewer is left with multiple meanings and interpretations of these metaphors or narratives. Bischoff\u2019s artistic freedom is expressed in the extensive preliminary sketches and drawings he makes for each piece, often including word references, in fact language plays a significant role in his work. \n\nHe studied at the Fachhochschule in Pforzheim under Reinhold Reiling, and at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich under Hermann J\u00fcnger, both leading contemporary jewellers. Later Bischoff lived for many years in Italy.",
