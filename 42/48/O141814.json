Tucker studied textiles at Middlesex Polytechnic form 1977 to 1980 as well as the Royal College of Art.  After graduating she established her own workshops where she developed a highly distcintive syle of painting directly onto cloth using sunny Mediterranean colours which were reproduced as scarves, dress fabric, screens and hangings. Since the late 1980s she has concentrated on commissions for public spaces.   One of her largest projects was for the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London for which she produced several painted wall hangings and designed a large-scale mobile.",
