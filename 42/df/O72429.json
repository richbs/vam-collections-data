The Arabic inscriptions, which are gilt, include the standard Shia Muslim prayer, the Nadi \u2018Ali, and verses from the Qur\u2019an. The armguard is also incised with the date of its manufacture, 1146 of the Islamic Hegira era, which converts to 1733\u20131734 in the Gregorian calandar. \n\nThe V&A bought the armguard in 1904 from a Mr G.H. Thomas, who said he had acquired it in India \u2018from the armoury of King Shuja-oddaolah of Afghanistan\u2019. The date precedes the two periods of Shah Shuja\u2019s rule in Afghanistan (1803\u20131809 and 1839\u20131842), but this does not necessarily rule out the stated provenance, since most royal armouries would contain earlier pieces, either received as presents or seized as booty. The 18th century was a period of great upheaval with frequent incursions by the Afghans into the Panjab, and it is impossible to know whether the armguard was made in a traditional weapon-making centre such as Lahore, or in Afghanistan.",
