It was commissioned by James Powell and Sons of Whitefriars, the leading manufacturers of glass at the time, and became one of their standard designs. One version was used in the east window of the Congregational Church, King Street, Maidstone (1860-3), and another in St Patrick's Church, Trim, County Meath, Ireland (1869).",
