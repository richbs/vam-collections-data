In 1767 she married Louis Alexandre de Bourbon, Prince de Lamballe, who was related to the royal family. Her husband died soon afterwards. The young widow became a confidante of Marie-Antoinette and, soon after the latter became queen, the Princesse became Superintendent of the Queen's Household; the highest ranking lady-in-waiting. In 1792, during the French Revolution, she was killed and decapitated.\n\nThe sculptor of this bust is not known. When it was acquired it was thought to be a work of about 1785, but more recently it has been suggested that it dates form the Second Empire, 1852-70.",
