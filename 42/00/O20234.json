Often sumptuously decorated, they rapidly became the dominant object on the dining table. Christopher Dresser's flat undecorated lid is in stark contrast to the more typical 'swollen' form of a conventional tureen, exemplifying his instinct for strict functionalism. The ladle also breaks with tradition by replacing the graceful curve generally used with a stricter, broken form, which requires only the slightest turn of the hand for serving.\n\nDesign & Designing\nDresser realised that the use of thin-gauge metal made the object inherently weak and therefore subject to distortion. His solution was to add reinforcing ridges and an internal lip, which gave the bowl extra rigidity. The articulations used in this design therefore had a functional as well as an aesthetic purpose. Other versions of this design were made with ivory handles.\n\nPeople\nUnlike his contemporaries, whom he saw as indulging in pictorialism and historicism for the sake of their superficial romantic associations, Dresser attempted to investigate the formal properties of the objects he admired. He developed fresh designs following on from his own  instinct for natural functional forms, which he believed to be appropriate to contemporary requirements.",
