It is light turquoise with red, blue, yellow, black and white markings. The underside is gold coloured. On the cycle is the figure of a boy with a soft vinyl head, upper chest of lithographed metal, upper legs of metal and lower legs and feet of white plastic. The head is painted to represent black hair and eyes and a white and red cap. It has the typical Western features favoured at the time. The legs are covered with printed cotton representing trousers. The feet are attached to a bar connected to the mechanism\nWhen wound up the cycle moves on two yellow plastic wheels set under the centre area and connected to the mechanism; there is a third wheel at the front. At the same time the figure's feet go up and down and the bell at the back rings.",
