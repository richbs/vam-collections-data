The epic story of a character based very loosely on the life of the uncle of the Prophet Muhammad chronicles the fantastic adventures of Hamza as he and his band of heroes fight against the enemies of Islam. The stories, from a long-established oral tradition, were written down in Persian, the language of the court, in multiple volumes. These originally had 1400 illustrations, of which fewer than 200 survive today. No contemporary version of the text is known, and it is now difficult to follow the complicated stories of the original. Work on the volumes probably began in about 1562 and took 15 years to complete.\nIn this painting, Hamza's scout Kawsadi has been searching for his lost horse, and discovers it being devoured by a lion near the sleeping giant Zumrud Shah.",
