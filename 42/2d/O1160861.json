Lewis's chief silversmith was Edward Farrell.\n\nHistorical significance: These sauceboats are a spectacular example of the antiquarian taste for stylistic revivals which was promoted by the dealer Kensington Lewis from his shop in St.James's Street, Westminster, London who was 'silversmith to HRH The Duke of York'. Lewis dealt in antique silver, specializing in elaborately chased and embossed Baroque silver and was associated with the silversmith Edward Farrell from 1816 to 1834. Lewis's business collapsed as a result of debt in 1834.",

The identical pair of sauceboats in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston are similarly engraved with the Royal crest and Garter Motto with the Royal duke's coronet above.\n\nThe Boston sauceboats were formerly in the collection of Earl Howe and were sold at Christie's London 1 July 1953 and again from the estate of Villiers David on 27 November 1985.",
