Italian goldsmiths were expert at making a little material go a very long way.  Many pieces seem too large to wear comfortably, but they are usually made of very thin gold, and are much lighter than they appear.  \n\nAll Italian women wore gold earrings.  Their shapes varied widely in different places.  This earring comes from Romagna, and is typical of central Italy.  Its Italian name, navicella, means boat-shaped.  Although this is a very small example, earrings of this design can be very large, and often have pear-shaped pendants hung from the rings on the lower edge.\n\nIt was bought for 12 shillings as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
