The container consisting of two pairs of layers, and the cap of one pair, the outermost layer of each decorated in low relief.  Not lined.  \n\nFlat upright rectangular form.  Shut-over cap and embushment.  \n\nOn the front, in smooth relief against a stippled ground, wreath surrounding the Sacred Letters IHS in roman character, with an abbreviation mark above.  On the rear, a similar wreath containing a star.  On the front and rear of the cap, paired leaf-scrolls, and on the top of the cap, among leaf-scrolls, the legend, in roman letter, AVE MARIA on each end of container and cap, a pair of eyes, incised in the form of lion-masks, for a flat -strap long wanting; below, scale pattern.  On the base, a diaper of lines.\n\nITALIAN; about 1500\n\nAn engraved slip of paper, found in 1955 inside the case, on prising it open, and then gummed into the Register (w.416-1922) shows three views of the case: the front (top left), the end (top right), and the top (seen from above).  The first two show the eyes threaded with a round tasselled thong, apparently textile and certainly adventitious, while the third shows the eyes void.  This engraving corresponds in detail with an engraving published by Henry Shaw, Dresses and Decorations of the Middle Ages, Fol II, 1843, Item (54) Cut. \n\nCase formerly at Parham Court (otherwise Parham House), near Arundel Sussex in possession of the Baroness Zouche, and sold hence at Sotheby's on 2nd November 1922 (Lot 378), whence it was acquired for the Museum (\u00a312:10:0)\n\nPurchased about 1840 at Venice by the Hon ble Robert Curzon (b.1810, d.1873), later 14th Baron Zouche, perhaps best known for his Monasteries of the Levant (1849) and illustrated by him in his Catalogue of Materials for Writing\u2026in the Library of the Most Honourable Robert Curzon at Parham in the County of Sussex (50 copies folio), 1849, p.1 from engraving differing from the aforesaid, with the description:-\n\n\"Case for a book, made of boiled leather with ornaments of very good design of the fifteenth century.  It came from Venice.\"\n\nWith this compare Shaw's brief description.  \n\nNo negative (1957)\nIllus by Henry Shaw, Dresses and Decorations of the Middle Ages, 2 vols, 1843, vol II, Item 54 cut.\n\nIllus. from his own possession, at Parham Court, Sussex, by Robert Curzon, later 14th Baron Zouche, Catalogue of Materials for Writing\u2026in the Library of the Most Honourable Robert Curzon at Parham in the County of Sussex  (50 copies only) 1849, p2, from an engraving, of which a copy, from or for a copy of this work, is still (1955) contained in the case, and described as \"Case for a book, made of boiled leather, with ornaments of very good design of the fifteenth century..It came from Venice\"  (catalogue p.2), That is was \"purchased at Venice\" by the Hon Robert Curzon, junior.",
