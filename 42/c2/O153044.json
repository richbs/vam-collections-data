            "physical_description": "Woven wool twill embroidered with wool in straight stitches.\nThree pieces, 2 selvedges, partially hemmed; the embroidery was worked after the fabric was seamed.  Deep orange ground with a central panel decorated with a densely packed circular medallion of blue and green concentric rings holding tiny botehs in red, outlined in yellow, leading into a shallow 32-pointed star, whose points lead into  a blue lozenge form outlined in red, alternating with a red/yellow boteh in the indentations, all on a green ground with small red and black floral motifs.  A red stripe echoes and multiples the star formation terminating in a multitude of large and small leaf forms in red, all outlined in black.  The small motifs leading into a red cypress motif outlined in pale blue, each joined on the top by an arching band in red, and ending with a feathery plant form in red with green, black and yellow highlights.  The orange field then dominates until the corner units whose shape echoes the arched outline of the main medallion.  These corner units are not exactly symmetrical, suggesting that these sections were not delineated in ink beforehand. Their ground is leaf green decorated with red rosettes and leaves and patterned with two adorsed blue botehs one either side of a blue cypress tree, both edged in black and yellow; a curving red stem connects these units.  A fan of five leaves is placed within each of the curved arch forms pointing into the centre, while around the four sides of this central panel is a repeat of the red band marked with a row of tiny botehs.\nInner border: a continuous series of a composite floral motif, patterned and coloured like a peacock fan [green with red rosette 'eyes'] emerging from a small blue vase from which springs a thick red stem with light blue highlights wither side.  These stems curve upwards to meet a blue arched form, similarly edged in red, holding a red serrated leaf motif edged in white.  A row of botehs edge top and bottom of this band.\nOutermost border: 6.5 cm wide around all four sides.  Densely packed border band the top of which is a row of small points edged in black surmounted by a row of tiny botehs all facing anticlockwise in blue or red.  The band itself has a red stitched ground carrying alternate motifs of a green serrated leaves flanked by two confronting botehs at the top in yellow, green and red and a similar blue leaf with 2 horizontal leaves at the base, both edged in white.  A narrow green chevron border finished with a red stripe with light blue/black 'beads'.\nThere is evidence of ink drawing or printing for the boteh outlines which was ignored by the embroiderer.\nEmbroidery Threads: 2S-plied wool: white, black, 2 shades of red, blue, light blue, yellow, green and dark green.",
