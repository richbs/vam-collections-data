Critics praised Anita Harrris for bringing a new pathos and dynamism to the role, and she is seen here in a print after the original painting by her husband, the artist and director Mike Margolis.\n\nCats first opened at the New London Theatre on 11th May 1981, with Elaine Paige as the original Grizabella who had taken over the part at short notice before the opening from Judi Dench who had to withdraw due to injury. The musical was inspired by T.S. Eliot's book of poems 'Possom's Book of Practical Cats' which however didn't include Grizabella.  She was inspired instead by an unpublished fragment from Eliot's poems about a glamour cat who had an obscure and dissolute life. Lloyd Webber composed her theme 'Memory' in one night, and Trevor Nunn wrote its lyrics, in part inspired by another Eliot's poems, 'Rapsody on a Windy Night'.",
