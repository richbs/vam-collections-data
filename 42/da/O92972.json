It appears to have been painted dark brown with tan cream details at the strap lines and saddle skirts. The whole horse may have been covered or it may be that the light areas only were covered as there are traces of red leather cloth. Nailed to the back is a pre-shaped metal saddle covered with red leather cloth. The head to the base of the neck is of cast iron, screwed to the body with the joint covered with plaster and painted. The head may have been painted or covered with red leather. The horse is mounted on a metal tricycle frame. The spoked wheels are of iron and the front one has foot rests used for steering. The body is supported on to the back wheels by two decorative cast iron struts. Between the struts is a ratchet around which passes a chain. The chain passes up into the body and head to a sword ratchet inside the head between the ears. Through the neck is a pair of handles which when turned engage the chain and ratchets and turn the back wheels. The mane area is covered by a curved length of wood. There are also the remains of a black horse hair tail.",
