It then passes through a series of loops and turns having an orientation transverse to the blade. They provide a 3-point rest for the server and which allow it to rock forward and back. The sturdy loops also provide a \u201csqueezable\u201d hand-hold for grasping the server. The blade is poised at an angle to the horizontal (the table top).

By contrast, the work of Angus McFayden illustrates the decorative aesthetic that highly developed piercing skill can achieve in the 2-D conformation.",
