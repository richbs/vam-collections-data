The composition was reworked following the deaths of the sculptor's sons. In its stark realism and emotional directness it closely resembles Meunier's sculptures of miners from the Belgian coalfields, also described in Zola's novels at this period. Manual labour was then an important sculptural theme, sometimes treated in a more overtly political way, as in Dalou's projected Monument to Labour.",
