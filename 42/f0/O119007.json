Eve holds the apple behind her back and the crowned serpent, coiled around a tree, takes another fruit from her hand. Adam is holding a branch of mountain ash, symbolising the Tree of Life. A parrot is perched in the branch and a tablet bearing D\u00fcrer's inscription hangs from it. A forest forms the background with a craggy peak and mountain goat visible in the top right hand corner. There is a mouse and a cat (a symbol of choleric temperament) by Adam and Eve's feet. A rabbit (a symbol of sanguine temperament), an elk (a symbol of melancholic temperament) and a bull (a symbol of phlegmatic temperament) are positioned in the forest. The iconography relating to the theory of the temperaments/humours is a reference to the philosphy that Man contained a perfect balance of the four humours before the Fall. After the Fall the nature of each human was thought to be corrupted by the dominance of one or another of the humours.",

These studies range from proportional constructions of the figures to detailed studies of parts of the figures and the landscape. D\u00fcrer's pride in the final print is displayed in the longest, most prominent inscription he ever made on an engraving: 'Albrecht D\u00fcrer of Nuremberg made this 1504' (Albert[us] Dvrer Noricvs faciebat 1504)",

            "history_note": "D\u00fcrer produced this engraving at a point in his career characterised by the expansion of his workshop and an increasing sophistication in the technique and subject matter of his prints. Two trial proofs exist for this engraving which show how the image was worked and built up section by section with most of the  wooded background completed first and  the two figures left until last.\n\nThis impression was acquired by the Museum in 1910 as part of the Salting Bequest.\n\nHistorical significance: Five states of this engraving exist as well as preparatory drawings suggesting that D\u00fcrer took particular care over its design. The inscription 'Albrech D\u00fcrer of Nuremberg made this (AD monogram) 1504' was the longest and most emphatic that D\u00fcrer ever added to one of his prints, which could  be interpreted as a sign of pride in the work. D\u00fcrer was the first artist to make full use of his monogram as a form of trademark, emphasising the authorship of his prints and ensuring that his graphic work spread his reputation throughout Europe. It has been suggested that the thorough integration of the inscription into the design of this print may have been intended to deter copyists who could legally copy the image, but not the inscription and monogram. \n\nAdam and Eve shows the application of D\u00fcrer studies into human proportion which began to appear in his drawings around 1500. Eventually D\u00fcrer published the 'Instructions on Measurement' (1525) and 'Four Books on Human Proportion' (1528). The nude figures of Adam and Eve, shown in a classical contrapposto stance, demonstrate D\u00fcrer's active interest in absorbing Italian Renaissance principals into his work and presenting them to a Northern audience.\n\nThe Print is also notable for the differentiation of textures that D\u00fcrer achieves including bark, animal fur, human hair and snake skin. The lighter use of lines and stippling on the figure of Eve gives her skin a softer, whiter and more luminous appearance than Adam\u2019s",

            "production_note": "There is a Bulls head watermark. Possibly Meder 3/a as there is a scratch on Adam's thigh, but no scratch is visible on his hip. There is a scratch towards Eve's left knee. Scratches in the sky are difficult to interpret. Comparable impressions in the British Museum have not been asigned Meder letters.",
