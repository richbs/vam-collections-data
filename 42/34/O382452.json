At the top of each side is a scroll of double-twisted wire.  A figure-of-eight loop in heavy wire is hooked across these two scrolls, attached to a short length of chain, with stamped links, with a loop at its further end.  There are two filigree bells attached to each side, and three bells of stamped silver hanging from the lower edge.",
