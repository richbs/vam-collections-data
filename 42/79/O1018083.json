            "bibliography": "Ward-Jackson, Peter, <u>Italian Drawings. Volume II. 17th-18th century</u>, London, 1979, pp. 106-107 The following is the full text of the entry: Design for interior decoration, showing segment of a hexagonal or octagonal cupola. Inscribed by the artist with a scale and a short note above it in which the only legible words are \u2018brazo partitto in 912\u2019; inscribed in pencil by a later hand (front and back) \u2018Pelegrini. \u2026\u2019 12 x 10 7/8 (305 x 276) 6669 PROVENANCE G. Vallardi (Lugt 1223); Charles Jourdeuil (sale, Sotheby, 12-13 June 1868, unidentified lot, bought for the museum) In the ribs which support the cupola the artist has shown two alternative designs. The sheet was formerly attributed to Pellegrino Tibaldi, but it displays a more evolved and extravagant taste than his. The ornament suggests a date well into the 17th century. The fleshy shell ornament high up on the centre and the tripe-like folds of the volute resting on the head of the kneeling triton on the right are hardly found in ornament until about 1620. The notion of supporting the lantern of a cupola on a circle of caryatids standing upon one another, with rectangular frames in between containing painted scenes, recalls the extraordinary ceiling by the rare artist Paolo Guidotti in the Palazzo Giustiniani at Bassano di Sutri. The ceiling (paid for in 1610) is illustrated and discussed by Italo Faldi in &lt;i&gt;Bolletino d\u2019Arte&lt;/i&gt;, 42, 1957, pp. 278-965. The drawing is almost as eccentric in taste as the painting, but the likeness is hardly close enough to justify even a tentative attribution.",
