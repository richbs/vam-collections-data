Although most of the clothes sold in Madrid echoed the pioneering designs shown in Paris each season, this particular piece seems to have been particular to the Spanish house. Originally, it had no ostrich feather trim around the sleeves, the only decorative edging being a scalloped finish like that round the front and neck edge. \n\nThis evening coat belonged to the film star Ava Gardner who died in 1991. It has a label with the word EISA sewn in at the back of the neck. EISA was the label under which Balenciaga's three houses in Spain (Barcelona, Madrid and San Sebastian) traded. Ava Gardner lived in Madrid for a number of years, and is known to have socialised in the infamous cafe Chicote as well as Balenciaga's premises across the road at Gran Via 9.",

This was the label under which Balenciaga worked in Spain; the client resided in Madrid and was known to move in social circles that congregated around the cafe Chicote (opposite Balenciaga's premises) in Madrid.\n\nHistorical significance: Significant because of association with a known wearer who clearly adapted the coat from the original design by adding a new trim, and because it seems to be an example of a garment (or textile) that was peculiar to the Madrid house of Balenciaga. In the Archives Balenciaga in Paris, no example of exactly the same design is available.",

He was unusual among couturiers for running a house in Paris (from 1937) and three houses in Spain (in Barcelona, Madrid and San Sebastian). The houses in Spain probably benefited from the influx of Americans after the War when the Hollywood film industry discovered the benefits of using Spain as a filming location. Ava Gardner was one American who became devoted to Spain, moving to Madrid in the early 1950s and living there until moving to London, where she lived in South Kensington not far from the V&A, a museum she appreciated. She ordered clothes from both Balenciaga's Paris house and Madrid house. Those from the latter would have cost her substantially less then those from former.\n\nThis coat is probably that worn in a photograph published in Miller (1993 and 2007) although the coat in that photograph does not have an ostrich trim round the sleeves.",
