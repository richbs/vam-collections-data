            "public_access_description": "The lyre, with its association in mythology with Apollo, the sun god, was deemed a particularly appropriate shape for clock cases.  They were produced in France in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in a wide range of materials: carved and gilded wood, marquetry, gilt bronze, marble and porcelain. In addition to this example in S\u00e8vres porcelain, there are two similar S\u00e8vres lyre clocks in the Royal Collection in London.  One of these also has a dial painted with the signs of the zodiac by the enameller Coteau, while the other is signed by the same French clock maker, Kinable.  A further example is in the Mus\u00e9e National de C\u00e9ramique at S\u00e8vres.\n\nThe model was introduced at S\u00e8vres in 1785 and went on being produced in small numbers right up to the end of the 18th century. We know from the factory's kiln records, that some thirty lyres went through the kilns from 1788-1797.  Most of those that survive have the deep blue ground colour, but a few are known in green, pink or turquoise blue.  King Louis XVI, is recorded as buying a pair of blue-ground lyre clocks on 4th January 1786 at a cost of 384 livres.  However, the factory records reveal that they were mostly bought by clock makers or marchands merciers (dealers in luxury goods) who then fitted them with clock dials and movements which are fortunately often dated and signed.  The clock maker Dieudonn\u00e9 Kinable was active from the late 18th century until after 1816.  His first recorded purchase of a lyre clock was on 26 pluvi\u00f4se an III (14 February, 1795).  Between that date and 25 March, 1797 (5 germinal, an V), he bought twelve lyres.  On 12 June 1806 he purchased a further seven.  While the date 1806 scratched on the springs of the museum's clock might suggest that its lyre case was one of the seven bought by Kinable in 1806, the fact that they were priced at a mere 48 francs each could indicate that they were part of unsold old stock which the manufactory was unloading at a considerable discount.   Reproduction Louis XVI lyre-shaped clocks were made in the second half of the nineteenth century, often copying the names and dates on known original versions.\n\nInformation taken from Geoffrey de Bellaigue.

            "bibliography": "Geoffrey de Bellaigue. <u>French Porcelain in the Collection of Her Majesty the Queen</u>, Royal Collection Publications, 2009, 3 vols. Vol. III, pp. 993-997. There are two examples of this model in the Royal Collection here in London, nos. 283 and 284. No. 283 is similar to 1004-1882 as it has a similar dial painted with the signs of the zodiac, also signed by Coteau, although around the dial it has gilt-bronze beads instead of stones. No. 284 has a dial signed by the clock maker Kinable. A third example with this type of dial is in the Mus\u00e9e National de C\u00e9ramique, S\u00e8vres and another was sold at Christie's, London on 14th July, 1983, lot 45. The model was introduced in 1785. The model went on being produced in small numbers right up to the end of the 18th century. Most of those that survive have the deep blue ground colour, but a few are known in green, pink or turquoise blue. In his commentary, p. 996, the author states: 'The lyre, with its association in mythology with Apollo, the sun god, was deemed a particularly appropriate shape for clock cases. They were produced in France in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in a wide range of materials: carved and gilded wood, marquetry, gilt bronze, marble and porcelain.' King Louis XVI, is recorded as buying a pair of blue-ground lyre clocks on 4th January 1786 at a cost of 384 <i>livres</i>. The factory records reveal that they were often bought by clock makers or <i>marchands merciers</i> (dealers in luxury goods) who then fitted them with clock dials and movements which are fortunately often dated and signed. The clock maker Dieudonn\u00e9 Kinable was active from the late 18th century until after 1816. His first recorded purchase of a lyre clock was on 26 pluvi\u00f4se an III (14 February, 1795). Between that date and 25 March, 1797 (5 germinal, an V), he bought twelve lyres. On 12 June 1806 he purchased a further seven. Taking into account all the dated and signed dials and clock springs, production would appear to have ranged from 1786-1819. 'While the date 1806 scratched on one of the springs of the Kinable clock in the Victoria and Albert Museum might suggest that its lyre case was one of the seven bought by Kinable in 1806, the fact that they were priced at a mere 48 francs each could indicate that they were part of unsold old stock which the manufactory was unloading at a considerable discount.'
