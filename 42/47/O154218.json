The complete lozenge is framed in turquoise blue with two floral pendants either side, all edged in yellow. The flattened form is filled with a large stylised '8' motif in turquoise edged in black and elsewhere there is a mass of coloured details mainly in red, pink, light green, white and blue.\nThe two incomplete lozenges share a similar lobed outline formed by floral details on a yellow ground in similar colouring.\nThe horizontal bars between the lozenges is again highly decorative with angular leaf forms sprouting from the main red and turquoise spindle, all edged in yellow.\nWarp: black and yellow wool; it is mottled in appearance but does not seem to be formed by yellow and black threads plied together.  It may have been resist-dyed. Or once the loom had been warped the threads might have been painted with the pattern to be woven. This requires further investigation.\nWeft: blue and black wool, both Z-twist; yellow, white, dark red, red and pink wool, all S-twist; turquoise, dark green, light green and grey wool, all indeterminable twist.",
