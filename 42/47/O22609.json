These were chosen by eminent Korean potter and professor Shin Sang-ho, whose own work the Museum has been collecting since 1991.\n\nWhite porcelain, made from a mixture of clay and crushed rock fired at a very high temperature, was first produced in Korea during the Koryo dynasty (918\u20131392) and came to dominate ceramic production in the Choson dynasty (1392\u20131910). Kang\u2019s unglazed porcelains are reminiscent of the austere white ritual wares produced for Confucian ceremonies in the Choson dynasty. His tall rectangular, cylindrical or triangular vessels are cast in a mould and then worked by hand. While the clay is still malleable, the artist \u2018spoils\u2019 the form by denting, puncturing or even slicing it.",
