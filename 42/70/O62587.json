The triptych clearly echoes devotional enamelled triptychs of the Middle Ages (of which the V&A has many examples), associating the sacraments which is the receiving the chalice with the notion of self-sacrifice by offering the heart.The image of the sleeping figure may indicate a further level of meaning, suggesting that artistic vision, symbolised here by dreaming  through the representation of a visitation from an angel-muse, can also be a religious quest.\n\nPeople\nPhoebe Traquair distinguished between 'epic' (large-scale) work such as tapestries and wall painting and 'lyric' (small-scale) work. From 1901, when she began her apprenticeship in enamelling to Lady Gibson Carmichael at Castlecraig, enamelling replaced book illustration as her preferred small-scale medium. Her work was greatly indebted to Medieval and Renaissance precedents, both technically and iconographically. Her jewellery, triptychs, caskets and mounted cups and covers, for instance, all have historical precedents.",
