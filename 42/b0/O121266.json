From the late 1500s onwards, Japanese men wore the inro suspended from their sash by a silk cord and a netsuke (toggle). They originally used it to hold their seal and ink or a supply of medicines. However, it rapidly became a costly fashion accessory of little or no practical use. Most inro are rectangular with gently curving sides. \nThe majority of inro were made of lacquer over a core material. However, in some cases, the entire body was carved or formed from a solid piece of material, such as wood. This example is made of gilded copper and decorated with an all-over design of floral scrolls in cloisonne enamel. The traditional use of lacquer for the manufacture of the inrobody allowed sections with an airtight fit, which was not possible from a solid material, such as this. This suggests that inro of this type were made as late collectors\u2019 items rather than for functional use. Its comparatively heavy weight would also have made it impractical.",
