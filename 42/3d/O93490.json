In this, the chair is similar to the bentwood chairs manufactured by Michael Thonet in Vienna in the 1850s and 1860s.\n \nThe extra strong restraining bar and the wide legs indicate that the designer has considered safety factors. Many earlier designs for high chairs had not been safe to use when standing alone. The splayed legs of this chair not only accord well with the lines of the design but also make the chair less likely to overbalance.",
