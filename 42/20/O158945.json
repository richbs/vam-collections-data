The latter is also used to over sew the thick strands at the bottom of the purse, where the threads are gathered into the tassel.\n\nA plaited draw-string of yellow and green silk runs through the loops of the top edge.",

This type of knotting is thought to come from the Islamic world, introduced into Europe via the Arabs in Spain as a method of tying off the warp threads of a woven fabric. It was practiced in France and Italy from the 14th century for fringes and decorative borders for linen.  Examples of this type of knotting dating from the 17th and 18th century survive in the V&A\u2019s collections.  It was given the name macram\u00e9, possibly deriving from the Arabic word miqram, meaning bedcover, in the 1860s with a revival of the craft.  Macram\u00e9 became popular again in the 1970s.  \n\nThe square knots of the bag are very fine, requiring a magnifying glass to see them.  Its open and delicate texture suggests that this tiny bag was probably intended to hold a keepsake rather than for everyday monetary use.",
