The complete outfit consisted of the suit, a printed rayon scarf and an original 1940s hat (loaned). Recreated by Cherry Parker in 1994, the suit was based on a two-piece worn by performer Lena Horne in a dance routine in the 1943 film \u2018Stormy Weather\u2019. Helen Rose\u2019s costume designs for this film are among the few surviving sources showing female \u2018zoot suits\u2019.\n\n\u2018Zoot\u2019 meant something worn or performed in an extravagant style and the term came to be applied to suits with  outrageously padded shoulders and trousers sharply tapered at the ankles worn by young black and Hispanic men in 1940s America. At a time when black Americans were expected to assume a subservient attitude to whites, the ostentatious zoot suit was a direct challenge to the social order. Its extravagant use of fabric also made wearers unpopular in wartime America.",
