Jacques Heim (1899-1967)  began to extend his parents' establishment, which specialized in furs, into a couture house in 1920. He launched 'Heim Jeunes Filles' in 1936 to follow younger tastes in fashion. All Heim's designs had a classical elegance that made them suitable for grand, formal occasions. His business closed in 1969.\n\nLong, sleeveless ball gown made of fuschia silk organza. The full skirt shows intricate pleats. It is shorter at the front than at the back, combining the formal grandeur of the traditional long ball gowns and the fashion for short eveningwear typical of the late 1950s.\n\nThis dress forms part of the Cecil Beaton Collection. With great energy and determination Sir Cecil Beaton (1904-1980) contacted designers and the well-dressed elite of Europe and America to create this lasting monument to the art of dress. The collection was exhibited in 1971, accompanied by a catalogue that detailed its enormous range.",
