It is simply carved and partly painted in ochre and orange; together with red and blue-black designs representing single flowers on the woman's dress and a blue `necklace'. The facial features are indicated by two pink cheek dots; black dot eyes and a red mouth. The figures and bench are one unit and pegged into a roughly carved base. The figures only are varnished. \n*This is both a toy and a symbol; the theme is expressed in other mediums such as the papier mach\u00e9. The symbolic message is probbly representing happiness and good marriage. \nA N Varganov is a well known and internationally known maker of these toys. His work is represented in other museums in the USA; Australia; Japan and Germany. He comes from a traditional craft family making\nthese types of toys; both wooden and papier mach\u00e9; from before 1900.",
