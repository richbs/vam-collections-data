            "history_note": "Despite being struck with a maker's and an assayer's mark in the bowl, the identity of the silversmith responsible for making this tazza has been the subject of debate. Charles Oman (1968: cat. entry 66) confidently deciphered them as the marks of 'Juan de Herrera' and 'Miguel Jeronimo Monegro', but as the bibliographical evidence he produced was inconclusive he declined to decide which of them was the maker. (According to Oman, the silversmith Monegro is first mentioned in 1544 and adds a codicil to his will in 1572; Herrera becomes head of the goldsmiths' guild in 1578 and dies in 1622.) In their guide to Spanish silver marks, Fern\u00e1ndez, Munoa and Rabasco (1992: p. 62) identify Herrera as the assayer and Monegro as the silversmith.\n\nThe various interpretations and attributions were summarised in Cruz Valdovinos (1992, no. 33), who then argued that the mark usually interpreted as that of 'Miguel Jeronimo Monegro' should in fact be transcribed as the letters as IV\u00ba / MDN\u00ba, or  'Juan Maldonado', assayer in 1554. On the other hand, he reads the other mark as 'Herrera', as Oman had done. Unlike Oman, Cruz Valdovinos identifies 'Herrera' as the maker (in part because this mark is stamped in a different part of the bowl to the others), but he is unable to use documentary evidence and comparison with similar marks to identify the maker conclusively.\n\nNothing is know of the tazza's early ownership. It was exhibited at the South Kensington Museum Special Loan Exhibition of 1881, No.937 (where a similar piece, No. 355, from the Paul Recappe Collection was also exhibited).\n\nHistorical significance: This is a rare surviving example of a type of drinking vessel mentioned frequently in sixteenth-century inventories. For other Spanish examples of the same form, see Esteras Mart\u00edn: 2005, cat. entry 11 (especially p. 92, n. 69) and p. 13, n. 1.",

The bell motifs round the foot recall a similar form of ornament on a chalice made in Cuenca (now in the National Archeological Musem, Madrid), a similarity which suggests the close links between the goldsmiths' workshops of Seville and the Central Castilian town of Cuenca (Cruz Valdovinos: 1992, cat. no. 33).",
