The Sindy doll was launched in September 1963. She was one of many teenage fashion dolls reflecting wider popular culture.\nSindy had everything a teenager of the 1960s could wish for, including a handsome boyfriend, Paul. As a keen follower of fashion she had a huge wardrobe of designer clothes and accessories. In the 1980s 'material girl' Sindy even gained her own houses and cars.\nHer most recent history has not been so favourable and has moved from one company to another over a short period these include, Hasbro, Vivid Imaginations, New Moons and currently Kerbury Ltd.",
