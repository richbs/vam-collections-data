It was not intended for mass reproduction, or as a portrait of the sitter, but as an artistic expression in its own right.<br><br>\n\n<b>People</b><br>\nWe do not know who the sitter is, but Julia Margaret Cameron photographed family, friends, servants and professional models. Cameron often posed women as well-known literary, mythical and biblical figures. <br><br>\n\n<b>Subjects Depicted</b><br>\nThis figure is inspired by Rebecca in the Old Testament (Genesis 24:42-67) although this photograph has also been titled 'Z\u00f6e' and 'The East'. Rebecca was a young virgin seen drawing water from a well and taken to Isaac to be his wife.  The story of Rebecca is regarded as a prefiguration of the annunciation. <br>\nCameron made some photographs very similar to 'Rebecca'. Apparently from the same sitting, 'Herodias The Mother of Salome' shows the same model in the same clothes and has a similar composition. 'Zuleika', shows a similar sitter in the same outfit. Zuleika is a character in the poem 'The Bride of Abydos' written by Lord Byron (1788-1824) in 1813.<br>\nCameron treats the subject sympathetically, and the expression could be read as one of either sadness or happiness. The soft focus of the image and the elaborate 'oriental' outfit worn by the sitter create the dreamlike distance of a story. Cameron's concentration on the head as opposed to the whole figure of Rebecca at the well suggests that the viewer is intended to concentrate on the psychological emotion of the character.<br><br>"

Here she poses an unknown sitter as Rebecca, wife of the patriarch Isaac in the Old Testament book of Genesis. By concentrating on the model's head and pensive expression, Cameron suggests that Rebecca's beauty is intensified by her destiny.",
