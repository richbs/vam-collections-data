            "public_access_description": "The model of the Empire Theatre is unusual as it shows the theatre's auditorium and not the stage.  \n\nThe Empire Theatre in London's Leicester Square opened in 1884. In the course of its 43 year history the auditorium underwent two major renovations. The original was in 'French Renaissance' style with the decorations in cream and gold and the hangings and seats in crimson. However, audiences did not have long to appreciate it as the theatre was closed in 1886 after its programme of ballet and operetta failed to attract spectators. After re-decoration the Empire opened again as a variety theatre. The Era newspaper of 24 December 1887 called it a 'Palace of Delight': 'the general character of the decorations of the auditorium is Persian, and turquoise and indigo blue, rose colour and crimson, black and gold are mingled with dazzling effect in its ornamentation'. \n\nThis decor lasted until 1904 when the whole theatre underwent substantial structural alterations, ordered by the London County Council for reasons of safety. This necessitated major changes to the auditorium, and these are represented in the model, though with a little artistic licence. A souvenir brochure, issued to commemorate the re-opening, drew attention to the circle, which 'consists of four rows of seats, surrounded by private boxes, the green silk hangings of which give a richness to the lower portion of the theatre. The design of the curve at this level, with one row of seats projecting beyond the line of the tier above it, is in the form of a horseshoe, and is of gilt wrought iron, and from every seat a good and complete view of the stage can be obtained.'",
