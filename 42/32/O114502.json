            "public_access_description": "European watches were sent to the Ottoman Empire in the sixteenth century.  From the beginning of the seventeenth century there was a body of Genevan watchmakers in Constantinople.  In April 1671 S\u00e9bastien Chappuis in Constantinople ordered fifty astronomical watches from one Genevan maker and forty from another.  Astronomical watches had a particular appeal because they could assist in the calculation of religious festivals.\n\nThe case of this watch appears to have been decorated and probably made in Turkey.  The movement was probably made by a Swiss watchmaker, either in Geneva, for the Ottoman market, or in Turkey.  The dial and movement bear finely executed Arabic inscriptions, which indicate that they were engraved in Turkey, not in Geneva.  \n\nThe name inscribed on the top plate of the movement in Arabic has been read as 'Jan Ptrw'.  A number of watchmakers named Pattru (or Patru) are recorded as working in Geneva in the seventeenth century. 'Jan Ptrw' may refer to Jean Pattru, who was working in the rue du Temple in 1666.",
