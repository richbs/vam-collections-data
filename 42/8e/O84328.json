Many of David Shilling\u2019s Ascot hats were witty and whimsical. \u2018Less about couture and more about theatre\u2019 is how the designer described his most extreme creations. This hat is a typical expression of Shilling\u2019s dramatic flair. Brightly coloured marabou feathers completely cover a large, cone-shaped silhouette and a visor of metal mesh frames the face. Curled strips of wire mesh adorn the tope and sides. The hat is completed by a sprinkling of battery-operated lights over the surface.",
