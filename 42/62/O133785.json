Entered RA Schools 1826. Worked as a drawing master in the 1830s. Exhibited 141 works at the RA between 1825 and 1883, 17 at the BI 1832-59, and 20 (including four watercolours) at the SBA 1829-35 and 1870-9. Early works were landscapes and costume pieces, mainly l8th century and in the manner of C R Leslie; from the 1840s he specialised in modem genre and social comment, before returning to landscape, particularly around his home in Abinger, Surrey, relieving the pressure of his administrative duties. Elected ARA 1840, RA 1851; Secretary of the Etching Club 1837-42. In 1847 he began his official career in art education as Master at the Government School of Design, becoming Head Master in 1848, Art Superintendent 1852, Inspector General 1857, and Director 1874. He was Inspector of the Queen's Pictures, compiling a catalogue of the Royal Collection, 1857-79. As he wrote in 1856: 'I regret to find that I am so identified with office work that it is almost forgotten that I am a painter' \n(F M Redgrave <u>Richard Redgrave: A Memoir</u>. . . p l 71 ). He published An <u>Elementary Manual of Colour</u> ... (1853), <u>The Sheepshanks Gallery</u> (1870), and, most famously, with his brother Samuel, <u>A Century of Painters of the English School</u> ... (2 vols, 1866). He was offered a Knighthood in 1869, which he declined; created Companion of the Bath 1880. Died Kensington, London, 14 December 1888. His daughters Frances (who compiled the Memoir of her father) and Evelyn were also exhibiting artists. \n\nLIT: <u>Art  Journal</u> 1850, pp48-9 (referred to below as the 'autobiography'), with engr portrait; <u>Art Journal</u>I1859, p206; <u>Athenaeu</u>m 22 December 1888, pp854-5 (obit); F M Redgrave <u>Richard Redgrav</u>e, CB, RA: <u>A Memoir compiled from his diary</u> 1891 (referred to below as <u>Memoir</u>); F G Stephens in <u>Magazine of Art</u> XV, 1891-2, pp26-9; ed S Casteras and R Parkinson <u>Richard Redgrave</u> 1804-1888 1988, V &A and Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, USA, exhibition catalogue \n\n\n\n<b>The Stream at Rest </b>\nP10-1967 Neg FG1261 \nCanvas, 40.6 X 76.2 cm (16 X 30 ins) \nSigned and dated 'Richd Redgrave 1848' bl \nGiven by Mr and Mrs Frank M Greco 1967 \n\nExhibited at the RA in 1849; the title was accompanied in the catalogue by the following quotation from Thornson's <u>The Seasons</u> ('Autumn'): \n\nWhy should the waters love \nTo take so far a journey to the hills, \nWhen the sweet valleys offer their soil,\n Inviting quiet, and a nearer bend? \n\nRedgrave had contributed designs for wood-engravings to illustrate a 1842 edition of <u>The Seasons</u>; they do not relate to the present work. \nThe<u> Athenaeum</u> critic admired the attention to detail, and the <u>Art Journal</u> thought it 'one of those shaded passages of river scenery which this artist renders with such natural truth . . . The sentiment of the picture is charming, and the execution masterly'. \n\nPROV: Probably John Gibbons, his sale Christie's 26 May 1894 (53), bought in \u00a312 12s (the Christie's stencil on the back of the work refers to this lot; the sale catalogue gives the title as 'A place where the jack lie', a picture exhibited at the BI in 1846, and the size as '15\u00bd by 31 inches', which is about correct for 'The Stream at Rest' while the BI catalogue gave the measurements as '17 by 24 inches', including the frame); sold Christie's 11 March 1949 (71), bought Roland (or Young, according to the V&A annotated catalogue) \u00a33 3s; given to the museum by Mr and Mrs Frank M Greco 1967 \n\nEXH: \tRA 1849 (174); <i>Richard Redgrave</i> 1804-1888 V &A and Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, 1988, (91) \nLIT: <u>Athenaeum</u> 26 May 1849, p548; Art Journal 1849, pp168-9; <u>Casteras and Parkinson</u> pp 131-2 (repr) \n\n\n\nRonald Parkinson.\"\n<u>Victoria and Albert Museum Department of Prints and Drawings and Department of Paintings, Accessions 1967 </u>.
