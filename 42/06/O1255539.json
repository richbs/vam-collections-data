They were born in Ramsgate, Kent, to Jules and Agnes Richeux. Jules Richeux became the lessee of the Artillery Theatre, Woolwich. Following his death in 1911 at the age of 48, his wife took over the running of the theatre. In 1914 Agnes married Frank Littler who adopted her five children (a sixth had died in infancy). All the children took their stepfather's name.\n\nThis cartoon shows Emile as a sophisticated golfer, and his brother Prince as a country bumpkin, highlighting the differences in their characters. While Emile was comfortable socialising and playing golf, Prince was a shy man, happiest on his farm where he was a passionate breeder of Guernsey dairy cattle with a herd of prize-winning Guernsey cows.\n\nCartoonist John Musgrave-Wood signed his wartime cartoons 'Jon' but changed this to Emmwood to differentiate himself from John Philpin Jones, then working for The Sunday Pictorial, who also called himself 'Jon'. Musgrave-Wood was best known as a political cartoonist but began producing theatre cartoons for The Tatler &amp; Bystander in 1948, as a successor to Tom Titt, and in 1953 was asked to provide illustrations for the show business page of The Sunday Express.",
