In this painting, the artist pokes fun at the figure of the Mullah by depicting several nudes in various positions - some partially hidden by serpents others by trees.\n\nTassaduq Sohail was born in Jullundhar, East Punjab in 1930. After the partition of India, the artist fled with his family to Pakistan where he settled in Karachi. In the early 1960s Sohail moved to London and began taking drawing classes at Central Saint Martins School of Art. In his watercolours, the artist often ridicules mullahs, rabbis and priests by depicting them in compromising situations. Sohail has also produced many naive and fantastic landscapes where animals frolic and trees flourish.",

Sohail is his takhallus (pen-name in Urdu), referring to the star Canopus ... He approves of the titles 'Mullah at Night' and 'Mullah looks at Life'. He says that the drawing is about how life is messed up by the Mullahs.\"\n\nA retrospective of the artist's work was held at the Noble Sage Art Gallery in London from 20 June-2 September 2007.",
