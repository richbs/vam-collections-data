In the following years he travelled around Savoy, the Balneic Islands and Spain. He mainly produced genre and landscape paintings.\n\nThis painting is a fine example of Kunkler\u2019s small oeuvre, mainly constituted of landscape and genre scene such as the repent one, and mostly owned by private collectors. This work shows an offer in marriage: are present the father, the daughter and the potential husband. The interest in rustic subject combine with a free realistic approach is typical of the Realist movement emerged in France in the 1840s. This painting is also a good example of the type of subject produced by the artists of the D\u00fcsseldorf school, influenced by the Biedermeier imagery.",

An offer of marriage (Savoy). By Adrian Kunkler. In frame. Signed. Swiss. Dated 1855'; bequeathed by Rev. Chauncey Hare Townshend, 1868.\n\nThe Townshend Bequest was made in 1868, according to the Will of Chauncey Hare Townshend. As can be ascertained from the registered files, the bequest entered the museum in that year. In his introduction to <i> A Descriptive Catalogue of the Historical Collection of Water-colour Paintings in the South Kensington Museum </i> (London: Chapman na d Hall, 1876) Samuel Redgrave also gives the date of the bequest as 1868 as does Kauffman in; Kauffmann, C.M.<i>Catalogue of Foreign Paintings, II. 1800-1900</i> (Victoria and Albert Museum, London: 1973). However in more recent publications the date has been given as 1869, which is the year in which the objects were catalogued.\n\nHistorical significance: This painting is a fine example of the output of the D\u00fcsseldorf school, an artistic movement developed in D\u00fcsseldorf, germany under the influence of the French Realist painters, the Biedermeier imagery and the proximity of the Netherlands which facilitates the influence of the work of such 17th-century Dutch masters as Gerrit Dou and Gabriel Metsu and such contemporary Dutch and Belgian genre painters as Ferdinand De Braekeleer. By the 1850s much of the work produced by the D\u00fcsseldorf school consisted of sentimental and anecdotal genre scenes, for example Knaus\u2019s The Cardsharp (1851- Kunstmuseum, D\u00fcsseldorf). This type of painting was practised well into the 1880s by some of the original members and their followers.\nThis scene is set in the western European region of Savoy where Kunkler stayed in 1854. The Swiss-born artist travelled extensively in Savoy and Spain and was a keen observer of local customs. Here he shows the cottage interior in great detail, with its furniture, pots and pans and fresh vegetables for cooking. The scene is also one of awkward tension, with an unsuitable man presenting himself for marriage to a sceptical young woman. The elder man, presumably the woman's father, adds an element of ambiguity to the narrative as it is difficult to tell whether or not he supports the proposal.\nThis painting was bequeathed by the Rev. Townshend who owned a large collection of 19th-century landscape and genre paintings. It is not unlikely that Townshend, who resided part of the year in Lausanne, acquired this painting directly from the artist.",
