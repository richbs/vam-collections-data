Bernard (Lugt 1419 on the mount and Lugt 1420 on the back); Dyce Bequest 1869 LITERATURE <i>Dyce Catalogue</i> no. 230 (as by Titian); Reitlinger, p. 12, no. 19 (as by Titian); Bornius, p. 224; H. Tietze and E. Tietze-Conrat, \u2018On several drawings erroneously attributed to Titain\u2019 in Gazette des Beaux Arts, 6th series, 22, 1942, pp. 118-19 and fig. 6; Tietze and Tietze-Conrat, no. 1934 The name Tiziano is written against the number K.63 in the Rest MS catalogue in the British Museum (described in Popham, Resta; Lugt 2981; and Lugt, Supplement, p. 419). This old attribution is rejected by Tietze and Tietze-Conrat, on the grounds that the drawing is too weak. It is hard to disagree. The weakness becomes manifest if a comparison is made with a drawing in van Dyck\u2019s Italian Sketch Book in the British Museum, which, as the Tietzes were the first to point out, is copied from a picture or drawing of the same subject (p. 16 verso, reproduced in Anton van Dyck. Italienisches Skizzenbuch, Vienna, 1965). Van Dyck\u2019s drawing clarifies certain passages which are insdistinct or mismanaged in the Dyce drawing, notably the hands and feet. That puzzling tubular-looking object which hangs from the Virgin\u2019s right wrist in our drawing is shown in the van Dyck drawing to be the outer side of a cloack which hangs over her shoulders and catches the light as it fall down. Th shape in the Dyce drawing is so little like a fold in a cloak that it suggests a misunderstanding on the part of the copyist. The lack of shading in the dark hollow of the cloak below the Virgin\u2019s wrist is another defect, and so is the scamped hand. In fact the drawing is probably a copy, taken from the same picture or drawing as van Dyck\u2019s sketch. The original may have been by Titian, os whose designs there are many copies in the van Dyck Sketch-book. The Tietzes\u2019 suggestion that the Dyce drawing is by Sebastiano del Piombo is not convincing.",
