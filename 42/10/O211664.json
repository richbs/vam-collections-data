Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hard-wearing. Above all, they had to have the means for attaching a cord. Netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated being the katabori (shape carving), a three-dimensional carving, such as this one in the form of a Mongol archer.\nDue to the figure's unusual clothing, wide brimmed hat, facial hair and large inlaid eyes the figure appears foreign in appearance and is probably a Mongolian.",
