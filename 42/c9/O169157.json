The back-frame is surmounted by a cresting with ogee-shaped sides, which is inlaid with a panel, similarly shaped, of pale wood; and the lyre is inlaid with the same wood in two rows of circles (at top and bottom) and a further shaped panel (beneath the bottom row of circles). The front legs are fluted on the front face, but plain near the top and at the feet (below the stretchers). \nThe seat retains its (almost certainly) original upholstery and black leather top cover, trimmed with two rows of brass nails, close-nailed, at the front and sides, and one row at the back; at the front corners the two rows are joined by vertically-set spaced nails. \n\nThe chair is of mortise-and-tenon construction, the stretchers tenoned to each other and to the front legs and back stiles; the bottom rail of the back likewise tenoned to the stiles, which in turn are tenoned to the top rail. CHECK SPLAT CONSTRUCTION (?BARE-FACED TENONS). The beech seat rails are tenoned into the front legs and back stiles, and the frame is strengthened with four open braces keyed into the rails.\n\nThe leather cover has has pulled on each of the hand-cut nails that fix it to the underside of the seat, forming a wavy edge. There are no visible nail holes from any earlier cover, indicating that the leather is almost certainly original -- as the upholstery structure also seems to be. This comprises a 1-chevron webbing of a dark (hemp or linen) warp and pale (hemp or linen) weft; a plain-weave (hemp or linen) base cloth; dark horsehair stuffing with front and side lips (for which stitching is visible in the foundation); and a loosely woven plain-weave (hemp or linen) top stuffing-cover (exposed at the back of Circ.471-1960; the lip stuffing-cover isn't visible).\n\nThe frame has been extensively repaired.",
