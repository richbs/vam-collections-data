Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hard-wearing. Above all, they had to have the means for attaching a cord. Netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated being the katabori (shape carving), a three-dimensional carving, such as this one in the form of a rat on a piece of salmon. \n\nFrom the 18th century onwards, netsuke were increasingly signed with the carver\u2019s name. Ogawa Haritsu (1663-1747) was an individualist of many talents and skills, who specialised in ceramics, painting and lacquering. This netsuke is signed with \u2018Kan\u2019, one of Haritsu\u2019s seals. Haritsu was well known for using lacquer to simulate other materials, and there are many netsuke by him in the form of imitation sticks of ink. There are also a number of netsuke with the seal of Haritsu that depict a whole or part of a fish, such as this one. Haritsu was probably one of the earliest carvers known to have signed netsuke. This example, however, is one of many 19th-century copies.",
