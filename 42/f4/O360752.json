The panel is worked with a very fine cream silk thread for the ground and thicker shaded silks, mostly in beige and brown, for the head. The net is a tightly-worked twist net of the Lille type.  It does not continue under the portrait, the silks of which are not darned-in, but are worked as cloth stitch with the finer silk of the ground. The pinholes are visible where the coloured silk is turned at the edge of each pattern piece. The panel has been tacked to a later soft silk and the edges of which are turned-over to bind the edges of the net.",

There are no signs of any joins in the net and the panel is excessively wide to have been worked on a conventional pillow, although the number of bobbins (approx. 600) would have been manageable. None of the original edges are visible.\n\nThis panel and T.215-1985 are from the collection of Jeffrey Whitehead of Mays, East Grinstead, who was a member of the Burlington Fine Arts Club and who collected a variety of objects d'art in the 1870s and 1880s. The two panels were in an album of lace samples acquired at Christies.",
