This game is a computerized version of the popular board game, Trivial Pursuit, in which progress is determined by a player\u2019s ability to answer general knowledge and popular culture questions. The game was created in 1979 by Canadian Scott Abbott, a sports editor for The Canadian Press, and Chris Haney, a photo editor for Montreal's The Gazette. With the help of John Haney and Ed Werner, they completed development of the game, which was released in 1982. The computer version was published by Domark, a British video games software house, for the Amstrad colour personal computer. The name was derived from the given names of its founders, Dominic Wheatley and Mark Strachan. Domark developed and published many games for home computers in the 1980s.",
