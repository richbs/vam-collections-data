All the designs had to be\nsubmitted to a lengthy and complex refining process\nof presentation and exchange between designer and\nclient, who was represented by various committees\noperating under strict rules. Stamps, like the \ncoins of the realm, have to receive royal approval.\n Ashted Dastor Associates were initially invited to \nsubmit proposals for this project in 1991, and the\nminute attention to detail demanded both by \ndesigner and client is evident in the designs and \ndocumentation. Royal Mail described the reasons\nfor their choice of theme in these words:\n\"Britain's artists have made a unique contribution\nto the modern art movement, and their achievement\nis recognized in this set of stamps. It is Royal \nMail's contribution to 'Art in the Twentieth\nCentury', which has been adopted by Europe's postal\nadministrations as the theme to be celebrated in\n1993. The images presented here - from a sculptor,\na print maker, an iconographer and an abstract\npainter - are symbolic of the enormous and\nexceptionally varied talent that has been fostered\nin the past ten decades among the artists of the\nUnited Kingdom.\" The artists chosen (after long\ndebate) were Edward Bawden, Henry Moore, Ben \nNicholson and Stanley Spencer.\n\nArt in the 20th Century. Presentation pack consisting of\na sheet of card, folded in three, containing a black\npaper and cellophane folder holding mint condition\npostage stamps which reproduce works or details of works\nby Edward Bawden, 'Kew Gardens' [24p]; Henry Moore,\n'Family Group' [24p]: Ben Nicholson, 'Still Life Odyssey\nI' [39p]; Stanley Spencer, 'St. Francis and the Birds'\n[33p]. The sheet is illustrated with details of some of \ntheir other works, photographic portraits of the artists,\nand is printed with explanatory material, short\nbiographies, descriptive captions, credits and \nacknowledgements.\nColour half-tone, letterpress, colour photogravure\n11.5 x 21.6 cm                                               E.107-1996'\n\n",
