William Whitehead Watts, who is commemorated on the medal, was Professor of Geology at Imperial College from 1906-1930.  The medal was designed by the British artist Percy Metcalfe (1895-1970) who designed coins, medals and seals, many for the Royal Mint.  His best work was characterised by great skill in low-relief modelling and often extreme simplicity and clarity of the image, representing a break with the often crowded and fussy traditions of medal design inherited from the previous century.",
