            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of British Oil Paintings 1820-1860</i>, Ronald Parkinson, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1990, pp. 289-90\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\nBorn Pentonville, London, 24 February 1782, son of a Bank of England clerk. Apprenticed to the engraver Benjamin Smith 1797, entered RA Schools 1798. Worked first as watercolourist, miniature and portrait painter, and book illustrator, including 'Fashions' for Ackermann's Repository. Visited France 1817, lived in Scotland 1820-1823/4 and Italy 1824-31, specialising on his return in Italian genre scenes. Exhibited 103 works at the RA between 1803 and 1857,37 at the El 1829-53, 13, mainly watercolours, at the SBA 1824-33/4, and at the Old and New Watercolour Societies. Elected Associate of OWS 1809, Member 1810, Secretary 1813,1817,1818, resigned 1818; ARA 1833, RA 1838 (the first Diploma signed by Queen Victoria), Librarian 1844. Appointed Surveyor of Queen's Pictures 1845, Keeper of the NG 1847 (resigned from both 1855). Died Staines, Middlesex, 26 August 1857; his studio sale was at Christie's 3-4 June 1858. \nLIT: \tArt Union 1845, p54, 1847, p312 (with engr portrait); Art]ournal 1857, pp315-6 (obit); Mrs Uwins A Memoir of Thomas Uwins R.A. ... 2 vols, 1858 (reprinted with introduction by R Hamlyn 1978) \n\nSir Guyon Arriving at the Bower of Bliss 612-1875 \nPaper, 38.1 X 76.2 cm (15 X 30 ins) \nSigned 'T Uwins RA' on a label on the back. Purchased 1875 \nA sketch for the painting exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1849 (188), bequeathed to the British Museum by Apsley Pellatt in 1863 but destroyed in the Tate Gallery flood in 1928. The finished painting was exhibited with the title 'Sir Guyon (fighting for the virtue of Temperance) under the conduct of his spiritual guide, destroys the enchantments that have tempted his companions from their duty', and the following quotation in the catalogue from Spenser's Faerie Queene book 2 canto 12): \nThe constant payre heard all, \nYet swarved not, but kept their forward way, \nThrough many covert groves, and thickets close; In which they creeping did at last display \nThat wanton lady with her lover lose, \nWhose sleepie head she in her lap did soft dispose.\n His warlike armes ... \n. . . were hong upon a tree; \nAnd his brave shield, full of old moniments, Was fowly ra'st, that none the signes might see; Ne for them, ne for honour cared hee, \nNe ought that did to his advauncement tend; But in lewd loves and wastefull luxuree, \nHis days, his goods, his bodie he did spend: \nO horrible enchantment', that him, so did blend!' \nThe story of Sir Guyon had been a subject for the Sketching Society: drawings of 'Sir Guyon to the Palmer' by C R Leslie, J J Chalon, J Partridge, and Uwins were in the artist's studio sale at Christie's 3 June 1858 (93). Also in the sale were academy studies in black and red chalks (54) for the painting. Uwins had exhibited a portrait at the RA in 1808 of' Mrs Luke Clennell as Belphoebe in the Faerie Queene'. He was evidently disappointed with the reception given to the finished picture; in a letter to John Townshend of \n1 January 1850 (quoted in the Memoir p123) he wrote 'I am now engaged on a picture from Homer, which will fail as completely as the one from Spenser'. He continued on 14 January (Memoir pp124-5): \nYou are right, my dear sir, about Spenser. Nobody reads him but the artist; and the artist finds the 'Faery Queen' so full of the combinations which lend themselves to painting, that he loses his chance of pleasing the public in the love of pleasing himself. It was in this view that I spoke of my poor Sir Guyon as a failure. When the picture was at the Royal Academy people passed by it as if it was so much blank wall, and went on to a mountain scene, which to my feelings was full of nothingness. Poetry is too slow a thing for a fast generation ... \nAlthough the Art Journal critic (1849, p169) thought 'every part of the composition abounds with pointed narrative', the painting remained unsold and was included in the studio sale (150, as 'The Bower of Bliss'). A signed pencil drawing of the same subject but differently composed was exhibited at The Gallery Downstairs 1989 (U89). \nPROV: \tSold Christie's 3 June 1858 (140, 'A finished study, on panel, for the picture of Sir Guyon'); purchased from Hogarth & Sons, Great Portland Street, for \u00a321 in 1875 \n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
