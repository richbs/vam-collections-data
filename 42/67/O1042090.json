Carpenter (active 1930s)</b>\nPencil and watercolour and bodycolour\nV&A: E.303-1998\n\nThe low viewpoint of this design gives a dramatic perspective to the room. The bedroom looks like a Hollywood film set, which were extremely influential to the enormous movie-going crowds of the period (see also plate 58). The great expanse of polished parquet wood floor, the marble fireplace and the plush hangings around the bed suggest an opulent, carefree and glamorous lifestyle. The soft-focus edges of the drawing bring a dream-like quality to the bedroom. The panelling and colourful gesso decoration and the whole scheme is very much on a grand scale in the Neo-classical style of Louis XVI. The room in the foreground incorporates the wardrobe on the left with a full-length mirror on the central door, while the bed is positioned in an alcove after the 18-th century fashion. Stripped of furniture, the bedroom has a strong sense of spaciousness, resembling the look of a ballroom. It is unlikely that there were many who could have afforded a bedroom like this in a private house - it is possible it could have been for a hotel.\"",
