Between the medallions are groups of marching soldiers and animated inscriptions. The real and fantastical animals include ducks that chase one another in and out of the script. The Arabic inscriptions contain elaborate but anonymous royal titles and good wishes for the owner.\n\nThis type of secular decoration shows that this basin was a domestic object made for a palace rather than a religious building. It is an example of the distinctive dynastic style that developed during the first century of Mamluk rule in Egypt and Syria (1250\u20131350). This was when the sultanate was at the height of its power.\n\nAt first, scenes with human figures were common. These disappeared after 1300, and elegant inscriptions in Arabic became more prominent. The texts all name the patron or glorify the sultan.",

Aquired by the museum in 1898, the remarkable preservation of silver inlay with very few large pieces lost on the body, suggests that the basin was cherished and carefully handled to preserve its decoration. This basin, whose shape is typical, has an unusual decorative programme and, in conrast to other examples, rests on three feet. Varied decorative themes appear inside the rim, while a subdued design with bold inscriptions adorns the exterior. The interior features complex interlacing patterns and arabesque motifs amongst which a series of medallions feature mounted riders galloping and shooting, alternating with lunar figures. Between the medallions are groups of standing figures bearing arms and animated inscriptions with real and fantastical animals, including wild ducks, chasing one another in and out of the script. As a whole, the inscriptions are ambiguous, omitting the words \"al-sultan\", which is standard on imperial dedications, but include several other royal benedictions, and conclude with the phrase \"to the owner\", suggesting that the piece was made for an anonymous patron.",
