The first attempt at official registration was unsuccessful and the Interior Ministry denied its statues as being illegal. After demonstrations and public pressure increased the Ministry had to acknowledge it as a political organisation.\n\nIn February 1990 it formed the Alliance 90 for the Public Chamber elections together with two other oppositional movements, the 'Initiative f\u00fcr Frieden und Menschenrechte\u2019 (Initiative for Peace and Human Rights) and \u2018Demokratie Jetzt\u2019 (Democracy Now).",
