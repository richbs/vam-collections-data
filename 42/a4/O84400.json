They made glass for Hardman's of Birmingham, who were metal-workers as well as a stained glass firm, and maybe Osler's also worked for Rogers.  Was Rogers supplying vessels for ecclesiastical use, because I believe this is the type of glass that Osler's were supplying to John Hardman & Co. who would then mount it in metal.'\n\nHistorical significance: 'These book illustrations are part of the W.Harry Rogers Archive and to quote the information on the archive provided by 'RW' on 6 February 1998 on the registered file 1997/1476:\n\n'It is extraordinarily rare to have this kind of documentation at this level of production for the middle decades of  the 19th century.
