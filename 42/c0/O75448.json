Although their protest is directed against the world of the gallery and the museum, their witty and ironic posters appear in everyday settings. When this design was barred from public hoardings, the Guerrilla Girls arranged for it to be displayed on New York city buses.",

The rest of the\ncaption on E622 reads: Less than 5% of the artists\nin the Modern Art sections are women, but 85% of \nthe nudes are female. The image derives from a\nphotomontage of Ingres' 'Odalisque' with a Gorilla\nhead. The Guerrilla Girls wear Gorilla masks for\nperformance events, suggesting animal vitality,\nreinforced by reference to Hollywood-based male\nchauvinism. Their name is intended to conflate the\nevocations of \"Gorilla\" with those of the Freedom \nfighting \"Guerilla\" soldiers.'",
