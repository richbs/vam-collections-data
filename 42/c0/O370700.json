The inner structure is of steel. The material is joined by lacing through chromed eyes with a piped length of striped material. In the centre of the short sides of the rectangle the tube is sewn with darts to make it narrower. Attached to each side are two broad straps of striped material with three chromed press-studs, male opposite female. On the inside top of the front long-side is affixed a black plastic zipper which connects with a strip projecting from the base of a rectangular mattress fitted within the tube.\n\nThe mattress is covered on its top side with short-piled cream woollen material with two rows of fine white plastic buttons parallel with the long side. The sides of the mattress are covered with striped material, as is the underside which is laced along its centre, the zipper being attached to the lower edge of the front. This stands proud until completely unzipped, when it can be pushed down within the rectangular tube. The back third of the mattress is covered on the underside with with a thick woven sacking base which is affixed to the bottom inside edges of the tube but for curved cut-outs in the two corners.\n\nThe front side of the rectangle can be lifted by the straps to fold-over so that the press-studs can be attached at the back and sides. The mattress folds over at the same time, thus forming the seat of the sofa, the arms and back of which are formed by the tube. The five buttons coming through on the seat from the upper side of the mattress are covered in striped material. The back and sides of the tube are covered with hessian underneath.",
