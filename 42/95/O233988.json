            "public_access_description": "During the eighteenth century buttons were mostly used on men's clothing rather than  garments for women.  They served both a practical and a decorative purpose on coats, breeches and waistcoats.  A diverse range of materials were used to produce buttons including mother-of-pearl, steel, glass, enamel and textiles mounted on card.  From the 1770s picture buttons also became popular, first in France where they were known as 'boutons \u00e0 miniature'.  They depicted anything from architectural views to mythological scenes and historical events, from portraits to flora and fauna and even pornographic images.  They were printed, painted, engraved or drawn and usually mounted onto copper frames with a flat or slightly domed glass cover.  As with most other types of buttons they were usually sold in sets of 12, 16 or 24 to accommodate the needs of gentlemen's attire.\n\nThis picture button depicts a woman seated on a grassy bank holding what looks like a letter.  This type of outdoor scene or pastoral was a popular theme in French decorative arts.  It appeared regularly in paintings, tapestries and ceramics of the period.  Although this button is one of a set of 11 it is likely that there were originally more buttons in the set, but these were lost before they came into the museum\u2019s collection.  It was said by the donor that they had been worn by a lady when she escaped from France during the Revolution.  We cannot be certain whether this was the case but we do know that other surviving examples of picture buttons were worn by men rather than women.",
