Created with coloured cloth, silver threads and sequins.\n\nThe designs are on a black ground. The central medallion depicts the zodiac sign for Danu, the Archer (Sagittarius) set against a plain ground. Double square borders surround this central design. The inner border is decorated with four-fan tailed peacocks at each corner and four oval medallions from which flow delicate meandering foliate designs. The outer border is decorated with a chain of green and pink lotus flowers from which emanate silver tendrils of leafy design. Amidst the swirling motifs are figures representing a scene from an unidentified play or Jataka story popular at the time the kalaga was made. The characters which are repeated along each side show a nat-thar (angel, the depiction of which has clearly been influenced by a European model), a man with his lower garment tucked around his loins, a nat-gadaw (spirit medium) identifiable by her distinctive headdress (unusually for a lady, she is shown wearing a male pahso lower garment and this indicates that she is about to be possessed by a male spirit), and finally, a male nat (spirit) in full regalia. The figures are dressed in the costumes of the Mandalay Court ca. 1870-1885.",

The dimensions of this example suggest that it was intended to be used as a table cover.\n\nIt is said by the donor to have been made during the reign of King Thibaw (1878-1885). Peacocks  (the national emblem of the Burmese Kings) do suggest a royal connection and the artist who created the preliminary drawings and decorations may well have been a court painter as the work is so refined and elegant. However, designs and materials which had been reserved for royalty, and the artists of the palace workshops, became available to everyone after the final annexation of  Burma by the British in 1885, and artists were in need of a wider clientele after the exile of the royal family. Kalagas, of all sizes and types became increasingly  popular from the mid 19th century among both Europeans and Burmese.",
