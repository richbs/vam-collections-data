Constable made a pencil drawing of the same subject on 22 August 1823 which was sold by his family as Lot 171 at Messrs. Christie\u2019s on 17 February 1877.  He refers to the visit on which the drawing No. 257 [354-1888] was made in his letter of 5 September from Gillingham to his wife: \u201cOn Monday Fisher took me a magnificent ride to Sherborne, a fine old town with a magnificent church finer than Salisbury Cathedral\u201d (Beckett, II, p. 287).  Monday in fact fell on 1 September in 1823.\n\nNote on Nos. 256, 257, 259-262, 273-278 [281-1888, 354-1888, 835-1888, 815-1888, 266-1888, 356-1888, 605-1888, 198-1888, 171-1888, 340-1888, 245-1888, 259-1888]\n\nNos. 256, 257, 259, 260, 261 and 262 [281-1888, 354-1888, 835-1888, 815-1888, 266-1888, 356-1888] all come from the same sketch-book, measuring approximately 181 x 262 mm. (about 7 1/8 x 10 \u00bc ins.) and used by Constable both on his summer visit to Salisbury and Gillingham and his autumn visit to Coleorton.  The height of the pages tapers from 178 mm. at the outer edge to 181 mm. at the hinge edge.  Nos. 273 [605-1888] and 274 [198-1888], and possibly also Nos. 275-278 [171-1888, 340-1888, 245-1888, 259-1888], come from the same sketch-book, and show that he used it at Brighton, probably on his first visit in 1824; for their possible connection with a projected group of engravings, see also the note following No. 284 [817-1888].",
