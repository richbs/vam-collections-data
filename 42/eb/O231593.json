This design was for presentation in advance of the commission for the window which still survives in situ.  On the left of the design is the scene of the Three Mairies at the Empty Tomb and on the right is the scene of  the resurrected Christ appearing to Mary Magdalen known as Noli me tangere which in turn means 'do not touch me'.\n\nThe design was possibly by Nathaniel Westlake (1833-1921) a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the architect William Burges. Westlake began to design for the firm in 1858 and became a partner in Lavers & Barraud after 1868 after which the firm was called Lavers, Barraud & Westlake.",

Gorringes obtained them from 'a low-grade picture dealer who may have obtained them from an estate'.\nAndrew Elgin then rang the local low-end dealer (on my behalf) who remembers only that he has had them for 'awhile' (two years?) and that perhaps he had bought them at Brighton market.",

This attribution is made from an analysis of the style, matching it to a known window of the same design by that firm and from a label of the firm stuck on the back another design in the folio.\n\nThe design is on a sheet of textured standard artist\u2019s card and is worked up in ink and watercolour.\n\nThe two lights depict:\nThe Three Maries at the Empty Tomb\nThe Resurrected Christ appearing to Mary Magdalene\n\nA window with stained glass showing the above scenes was traced to Holy Cross and t. Mary\u2019s, Quainton, Buckinghamshire. The east window of this church is a five-light window with the scenes of:\n1. Descent from the Cross\n2. Entombment of Christ\n3. Resurrection of Christ\nPlus the above scenes.\n\nThe tops of the windows in Quainton Church differ from those in the design. It is quite possible that the design was made for another church and then reworked to fit the windows in Quainton.\nIt is hoped that the designs for the other three lights may turn up one day.\n\nThe firm of Lavers and Barraud was established in 1858 with premises at Southampton Street, Strand, London.\nNathaniel Wood Lavers (1828-1911) and Francis Philip Barraud (1824-1900) had previously worked in the glass firm of James Powell and Sons in Whitefriars, London.\nBarraud was working as the designer and Lavers was the craftsman. Barraud was dissatisfied with his own designs. William Burges recommended hiring Nathaniel Westlake as a designer.\n(1858) Westlake (1833-1921) joined the firm.\n(1859) Moved to Endell Street, Covent Garden, London\n(1860s) Westlake changed from a gothic style to one that was looser and more individualistic and depended heavily on 16th century prototypes. As the Aesthestic movement gathered momentum, the colour of his stained glass became diluted.\n\nOther designers for the firm:\nJames Milner Allen (1860s)\nLewis Day (1864 onward)\nFrederick Smallwood (b.1829)\nEdward Burne-Jones did one design (1860)\nHenry Holiday designed a number of windows over a 15 year period.\nMichael Frederick Halliday (1822-69)\nClement William Barraud (b.1843)\nJohn Richard Clayton (1827-1913) free-lanced with Lavers & Barraud from 1855 to 1858\n\n(1868) Westlake was made a partner (now Lavers, Barraud & Westlake)\n(1880) Westlake became the sole proprietor. \n(1880-1921) Firm\u2019s windows were technically excellent but not of the 1858-68 quality.\nWestlake carried on after the death of Barraud (1900) and Lavers (1911) until his own death in 1921.\n\nThe V&A has one stained glass panel by this firm, 780-1864, \u2018The Vision of Beatrice\u2019 which was designed by Nathaniel Westlake. The museum has no other works on paper by this firm.",
