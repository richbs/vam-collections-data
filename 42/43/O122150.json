His figure fills the centre of the cell and he is bent intently over his work at a small writing desk. A crucifix is attached to the desk facing him. The cell is intimate and clutterred. There are books, writing materials, an hour glass and objects used for devotion and penitence. A chest, cushion and curtain introduce an element of comfort. A lion, often associated with the saint fills the bottom left hand corner of the composition.",

It is classed as one of a group of prints that D\u00fcrer referred to as 'Schlechtes Holzwerk' (modest woodcuts).\n\nThe print was part of a large bequest made to the Museum in 1940\n\nHistorical significance: D\u00fcrer's detailed compositions in woodcut pushed the medium to new heights, demonstrating its expressive and narrative potential. Woodcuts form a significant part of D\u00fcrer's output, outnumbering paintings and intaglio prints and show the artist at his most innovative. He moved away from the two dimensional quality of earlier woodcuts, using hatching and undulating parallel lines to create form and dramatic contrasts of light and shade.\n\nIt is thought that D\u00fcrer did not cut the wood blocks himself, but followed the practice of the day by using professional  form-cutters (formschneider). Form-cutters are recorded in D\u00fcrer's home city of  Nuremburg as early as 1397. With the advent of moveable type the form-cutter's work became increaingly to cut designs and images for book illustration and single leaf prints. In this print the chiaroscuro effects are enhanced by extensive use of cross-hatching, creating a mesh of lines that would have required great skill to cut on the block.",
