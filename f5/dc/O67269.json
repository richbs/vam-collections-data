Upper: cut.\n\nDESIGN: Field: a dark blue ground with three rows of 'shield' motifs across the width in alteranting outlines of a geometric palmette and an indeted octagon.  The palmete shield encloses a tree with flower buds flanked by a smaller pair and standing on a rectangle containing a pair of birds or fish.  The octagonal shileds contain in alternating bands a similar design with a similar tree or a central rectangle from which spring a stylised flowering shrub. A stem on either side of the central row rises to the top of the carpet.  From it large white serrated leaves with a floral filling frame the palmette shields and smaller yellow or green leaves are above the octagonal shields.  These smaller leaves have a square or rectangular shape which gives them the appearance of a bird=s head.\nMain border: white ground with a stylised meander with markedly diagonal hooked blossoms. \nInner border: brown ground with black meander with a green S-motif and black and white blossoms. \nOuter border: as inner but with blue instead of white blossoms.\n\nCatalogue Date: 17.11.97",
