He worked in a variety of media but has become widely recognised through his later printed work, based  on the exploration of  colour. \n\n In 1949  he wrote a definitive text on colour theory and soon after began work on the series of coloured squares and rectangles which came to dominate his work and which explored the idea of colour as an illusion, depending on context. \"We do not  see colours as they really are\" he wrote \"in our perception they alter one another\"  Although he began his experiments in this field with paint, he came to depend on the medium of screen-print because its reliably consistent evenness of colour could be produced very easily and with great speed.",
