Wedgwood, however, was the first person to manufacture them in stoneware on a commercial scale.  \n\nUse\n  Wedgwood's medallions of 'Modern Subjects' were probably hung on the wall, in wood or brass frames, to display the political and cultural allegiances of the household. Sets of portrait medallions were also kept in cabinets. Wedgwood's letters indicate that his 'Modern Subjects' sold best  when their subjects were most topical.\n\nPeople\nSir William Hamilton (1730-1803), the subject of this medallion, was a diplomat at  the Court of Naples between 1764 and 1800. There he took a close interest in the archaeological excavations at Herculaneum and Pompeii and formed a vast collection of Greek and Roman vases. The collection was published in four volumes, the first of which appeared in 1766-1767 (an important landmark in the development of the Neo-classical style), and it was bought by the British Museum in 1772. Hamilton's collection was the most important source of designs for Wedgwood's encaustic vases.",
