As a piece intended for gentle use in a merchant's house, its brittle corners have survived almost intact.\n\nTime\nThe English Civil War of 1642-6, though localised in terms of the actual fighting, caused havoc in London and at other strategic places like Oxford. Royalist supporters were obliged to surrender their silver tablewares under threat of penalties and inspections were carried out. City Livery Companies like the Mercers in 1643 were forced to dispose of their treasures and to replace them with similar objects made of wood or delftware. It is probable that the table silver of a wealthy member of the Fishmongers' Company such as William Withers, the first owner of this candlestick, would have suffered the same fate.\n\nMaterials & Making\nFor practical reasons, some types of household equipment were usually made from certain materials. Traditionally candlesticks were made of brass or pewter, which could be cast or spun on a lathe, and which were fire-proof and heavy enough to be stable. Although the Civil War may have encouraged delftware potters to attempt new forms, unsuitable types such as candlesticks were soon abandoned. Delftware never became the tableware of the aristocracy.",
