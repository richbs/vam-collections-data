Many, like this example, had panels of cane-work in the back and seat. \n\nOwnership & Use\nThe chair might have been owned by a professional person or wealthy tradesman.  It would have been kept around the edge of the room, with its back to the wall, and brought forward when required.\n\nDesign & Designing\nSeveral features suggest that the chair dates from about 1700.  The front legs are dowelled into the seat rail rather than attached with stronger joints. The stylistic features that also point to this date are the plain-turned uprights at the sides of the back, the tapered barrel shape of the turned legs, and the linear mouldings around the cane panel in the back.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe chair is not of the first quality, but appears to be in good original condition. This type of chair was very delicate, particularly at the joint between seat and back. Many chairs from this date have been repaired and the parts replaced. Possibly this one survived well because it did not receive heavy use. The cane-work, however, is almost certain to have been replaced because it was so easily damaged. Originally, it would have been protected by a cushion.\n\nIt is made of walnut. This hard and durable wood was valued by furniture makers, especially between 1660 and about 1760, for its beautiful colouring and suitability for carving. Cheaper versions of this type of chair were often made of beech.\n\nThe letter 'I' is punched in the seat rail.  It is probably the mark of the unknown maker.",
