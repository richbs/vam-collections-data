Patterns were carved or pressed into tiles and then filled with coloured liquid clay creating a bold pattern. After 1850, the inlay technique was adopted again by English potters. Designs were carved into leather hard pots and filled with contrasting clays. \n\nThe potter who created this flask used metal printer's type to make the initial impressions. The use of type to create patterns was particularly common in the Sussex area. The decorative inscription is crisply visible against the body of the vessel. \n\nIn addition to this inlaid decoration, the potter has also incised a drawing of a small bird just below the mouth of the flask. The subtle nature of this motif contrasts with the striking inlaid patterns.",
