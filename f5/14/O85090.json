It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre. He compiled them in a series of albums.\n\nThe other songs that Lauder sang at Hanley were \u2018She\u2019s ma Daisy\u2019 and \u2018Stop yer Tickling Jock\u2019. In \u2018The Saftest of the Family\u2019 Lauder was an overgrown schoolboy relating the excuses he gave his teacher for his naughtiness.\n\nBorn near Edinburgh in 1870, Harry Lauder became one of the most internationally recognised of all British music hall stars. He had worked as a miner for ten years before he appeared with Scottish concert parties. \u2018The little wee man with the twinkling eyes\u2019 first appeared in England in 1896 at the Argyll Theatre, Birkenhead, as an Irish comedian. He became an overnight sensation in 1900 after performing Scottish songs at Gatti\u2019s music hall in London. His greatest songs included \u2018I Love a Lassie\u2019, which was first sung in pantomime in Glasgow in 1905, \u2018Stop Your Ticklin\u2019 Jock\u2019 and \u2018Keep Right On Till the End of the Road\u2019. \u2018Tobermory\u2019 was one of Lauder\u2019s popular songs, which he later recorded. He sang his songs in costumes related to their themes, and often carried the twisted walking stick seen here. He was knighted in 1919 and entertained the troops in concert parties in both World Wars. He died in 1950.",

            "history_note": "This caricature is of the music hall performer Harry Lauder (1870-1950), performing his song 'The Saftest of the Family' at the Grand Theatre of Varieties, Hanley, during the week of 28 August 1905.  The caricature is loose in the album, which explains why is it not in a chronological order with other caricatures in the album.\n\nLauder was one of the most internationally celebrated of all British music hall stars, known as 'the Laird of the Halls'.  Born in Portobello, Scotland he spent ten years as a miner, and made his first professional appearance with a concert party in 1892, later touring in variety for Moss and Thornton. He made his first appearance in England at the Argyle, Birkenhead in 1896 as an Irish comedian, and in 1896 with David Munro's Northern Concert Party. He was an overnight success in April 1900 when he appeared at Gatti's music hall in London singing Scottish songs, after which he regularly appeared at up to four London halls a night for seven months a year.  His greatest songs included 'I Love a Lassie', 'Roamin' in the Gloamin' and 'Stop Your Ticklin' Jock'.  He worked as a concert party entertainer during both World Wars and received his knighthood in 1919. The caricature comes from the first of several albums compiled by the graphic artist George Cooke, featuring performers working in music hall in the early 20th century.  The album is dated 1903-4-5.",
