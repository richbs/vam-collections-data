In the foreground is a man on horseback approaching a two-storied, battlemented gateway.  On the other side of the pot, below the rim, is incised a poem:\n\nTowards Chang'an on horseback\n[I saw] the red setting sun above the city walls\nThe five mansions with their terraces all aligned\nAre immersed in multi-coloured clouds.\n \nShort incisions have been added to the footring to simulate the texture of bamboo.  On the recessed glazed base is carved in high relief the mark Xinwu Hu Liuxiang zuo (made by Hu Liuxiang of Xinwu) in seal script.  \n\nCarved porcelain became popular during the Daoguang and Xianfeng periods, probably inspired by bamboo carving.  A large proportion of carved porcelains are items for the scholar's desk and, like Yixing and Dehua wares, many bear the mark of the potter.  Hu Liuxiang was not one of the better-known porcelain carvers, but his workmanship is of a very high quality.  The mark on the base, which would not be visible when the pot is in upright position, is carved to a depth of 2mm.  Compared to other potters who merely stamped their seals onto the base of pots Hu Liuxiang had set a very high standard for himself.  \n\nOnly one other piece with this mark has been published.  It is also a brushpot, glazed pale green.",

Carved porcelain became popular in China in the 19th century, probably inspired by bamboo carving. A large proportion of carved porcelains are items for the scholar's desk, and many bear the potter's mark.\n\nA brush pot such as this was an indispensable object in the scholar's studio. Scholars normally used a variety of brushes of different sizes, which were stored in a brush pot to keep the scholar's desk tidy.",
