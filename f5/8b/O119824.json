Beethoven was born in Bonn but moved to Vienna in 1792 when Haydn invited him to study with him, and lived there until his death. Unlike any other composer before him, his music made him a great public figure and when he died 10,0000 people were said to have attended his funeral.\n\nThis bust is made of biscuit porcelain, an unglazed porcelain introduced in the mid-18th century as a medium for statuettes and reliefs.  It could be purchased relatively cheaply and yet give the effect of a marble bust in a fairly modest home.  This continental bust was probably produced in the mid to late 19th century, along with busts of other famous composers including Mozart, Haydn and Wagner, but similar items can be bought today.",
