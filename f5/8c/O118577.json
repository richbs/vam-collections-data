In the Left hand at  the top is St George offering his  services to Sabra, whilst beneath  he is wounding the dragon. The  princess accompanied by the  Saint is leading the wounded  dragon into the city of Memphis where the King and Queen are  watching the scene from their  castle windows. Rabbits are seen  issuing from and disappearing  into holes in the rugged ground,  which is diversified by trees. A lion  sits near the walls of the city,  which is entered by a bridge over  a stream. Like medieval tapestries, the depiction of the story portrays different episodes of the story running into one another, allowing complicated action to be shown without consequent fragmentation of the design.\n\nWhen acquired it was thought to be English 14th century work and to have come from Rufford Abbey, Nottinghamshire, but it was subsequently condemned by Museum authorities as a fake. Various 20th centuries experts regard it as early 15th century, but Flemish, the carving of very high quality, and relate it to a chest with similar front panel at York Minster, dated c.1380.",

            "history_note": "This object was bought in 1893 for \u00a3206. Some 'slight restoration' was carried out before the panel was acquired by the Museum (see C. Reginald Grundy).\nThis panel was acquired as having come from Rufford Abbey and dating from about 1400, as English work. By about 1930 it was regarded by V&A curators as a 19th century forgery, being labelled \"English, style of late 14th Century. Apparently a modern adaptation of the coffer at York Minster\", a view they retracted after a vigorous article was published by Fred Roe and Charles Beard. Subsequent authorities have continued to regard it as late medieval of high quality, probably Flemish, with datings between c.1380 and '15th century', noting its similarity to the chest at York Minster.\n\n\n[Transcription from document on nominal RF, Marshall, Chas.H [MA/1/M 918]]\n\nNo 15215. \nnoted in fragment 16 jan 93\nminute papers herewith\n11 Pembridge Crescent\nJan 14 '93  [1893]\n[stamped DEPARTMENT OF SCIENCE &  ART 17 JAN 1883 4447]\nIn accordance with the request contained in your letter of Jan 11 - I went to Retford on Jan 13 &was received there by Mr Marshall an urbane and hospitable gentleman who gave me board and lodging, and with whom I spent a commercial day - far into the night - & recommencing next morning all this time I was employed in the interesting occupation of hammering politely at his big price for  his famous chest front.  S. George  with the dragon - encountered by that knight. Transfixed, & pinned to Earth finally led in a tame state by the young lady of the piece into Memphis - parents melancholy but, resigned to the (apparently) inevitable  looking on, &c &c.\n\nMr Marshall's price [\u00a3220] is enormous, but he is a shrewd man of business & I fancy will get it to the uttermost farthing elsewhere & I must own I consider that the Department should not let it escape.[underlining added later in pencil]\n\nThe other furniture of Mr Marshall's house seems to me, with one or two exceptions --reasonable in price. Indeed I venture to think that the objects of which I subjoin a list are very good money's worth indeed. \nI will take these in the order in which He has set them down in writing to Mr Clarke (so at least he told me.)\n\n1st.

They ae too much 'done up' & pieced. \u00a330 \u00a315\nI do not feel quite happy about the Worksop press - \u00a340 - It is quite genuine but large. & the carving though characteristic is not very artistic - However I leave it in the list. Mr Marshall would send all the small objects - S.George - screens. saddle gun &c. that can be packed in a box to the Dep.t on approval - \nSeeing what the Museum has had to give to secure former purchases at carved oak sales most of these objects seem to me Reasonable in price - Some (as times go) cheap. - Mr Marshall, an ingenious gentleman, suggests that his furniture prices are so much off St George -# Perhaps if such a list as has been made out were procured he would not be very far from the mark -\nStuart chairs less good than any of his went for 35 or 37 guineas each at the Turton Tower Sale - The earliest there sold cheap by comparison though the best - and now in the S.K.M. cost 11 guineas each.) - \nOther objects at equally or proportionally big prices -\nThe St George price \u00a3220 is (in the abstract) enormous. but when the object is very rare - very rare indeed, it is like the East lb loaf a siege and will realize a sum to make even the baker stare - ##\nI have no doubt Mr Marshall can get his \u00a3220 & am by no means sure that I could not find a buyer myself -\nI hope, therefore that the Departmental Courage will be equal to the occasion - \nThe panel is a Chest front probably made to contain the mantle mantle and insignia of the order of the Garter belonging to a Knight of the days of Richard IInd [added in pencil: 1377-1399] and Henry IVth [added in pencil: 1399-1412/5] or thereabouts. It is to be noted that the Saint wears a helmet like that of the Black Prince - that the heads are large - the hair of the heroine bunched out on both sides - I have little doubt of its being of English workmanship. Wood carvers were of high attainments in the 15th as well as in the 14th century. The landscape - trees - animals - town mountains &c are treated in the conventional manner of decorative carving of those centuries and the panel well filled by incident and by inequalities of rock &c. in the landscape. I am Sir, your obedient Servant JH Pollen\n\n[to] G.F.Duncombe Esq.\n\nP.S.\nMr Marshall declines to send his big things if they are to return, - \"Will not dismantle his hosue - would not know what to be at if the returns were contemplated\" & similar arguments - He has a patriotic desire that these objects shall go to the nation but there is a limit to his self abnegation -\n\n[Notes \n* added in pencil: see Mr Marshall's letter of Nov. 5. x but fixed at \u00a325 in letter of Jan. 17.\n\n# Apparently these objects were offered at low prices as a kind of discount on the St George panel price\n## Possibly a reference to an incident that occurred during the siege of Kimberly, during the Anglo-Boer war (1899-1902)] \nTranscribed by NH, May 2008\n\nArthur Marshall (1858-1914) was the third son of James Matthew Marshall, a well-known local decorator, carver and gilder. He was an successful architect but also an authority on antique furniture and wood carvings, and a fine water colourist. He was also a prominent amateur photographer,  exhibiting at both national and international events, and was at one time President of the Nottingham Mechanics Institute Camera Club.",

            "historical_context_note": "Rufford Abbey, Nottinghamshire was a Cistercian abbey suppressed in 1536 and granted by Henry VIII to George, 4th Earl of Shrewsbury. The sixth Earl rebuilt it (1560-90). In 1610, a new projecting wing was added to the northern end of this range. The estate was inherited in 1626 by Mary Talbot, sister of the seventh and eighth Earls of Shrewsbury, and it passed to her husband, George Savile of Thornhill. William Savile, George\u2019s successor, made Rufford Abbey the seat of the Savile family after he burnt down the Saviles\u2019 original home in order to prevent its being occupied by a Parliamentarian garrison during the Civil War.  In 1679, the Savile family constructed a new north wing on the site of the abbey church, containing reception rooms and a long gallery. They also built the large stable block to the right of the house. The surviving roofed southern service wing (currently used as offices) was also added by the Saviles in the 17th century. In 1938, the third Baron Savile inherited the Rufford estate as a minor, but his trustees split it into lots and sold it off. The abbey and park were bought by Nottinghamshire County Council in 1952, and the north and east wings were demolished in 1956. The remaining west range and south service wing were put into the care of the Ministry of Works at the same date, and are now (2014) administered by English Heritage.",
