The robe consists of a large square of satin folded in two, the fold thus forming the shoulder line which continues to the hem of the sleeves. One side of the robe is slashed to the middle and is shaped into a collar. The overall effect is voluminous. The ground of the robe is white satin, heavily embroidered, (particularly across the back) with brightly coloured silks and gold thread. The sleeves, centre front opening, neck and hem line are trimmed with broad embroidered red satin bands. \n\nEmbroidered on the back of the robe in the centre is a pagoda surrounded by a number of golden discs which are believed to have some connection with the stars and planets. Above the pagoda are three little gates and on either side the symbols of the sun and moon. The remainder of the field is richly embroidered with imperial dragons, flying cranes, bats and cloud forms. The lower border of red satin bears the eight mystic trigrams. The two fronts are lightly embroidered with flying cranes, cloud forms, bats and flowers.",
