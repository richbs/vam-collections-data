The original scheme that included this relief of a ram and a dog and the others is unknown.\n\nOn acquisition this group of reliefs was thought by the then Keeper of the Department of Architecture and Sculpture, Eric Maclagan, to be related to the work of John Bacon the Elder (1740-1799), but he considered them to be probably early 19th century.
