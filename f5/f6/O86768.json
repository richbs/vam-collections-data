The act was billed as the \u2018Extraordinary Engagement of Bella and Bijou. Society Entertainers\u2019. This is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre. He compiled them in a series of albums.\n\nAdvertised as Bella and Bijou, Society Entertainers, the duo performed musical duets. They had appeared at Hanley the previous February. In May 1906 they were on the bill at London\u2019s most elegant music hall, the recently opened Coliseum.\n\nPeter Bijou\u2019s sartorial style of dress confirms his status as an elegant entertainer. A review of the performance at Hanley praised the duo\u2019s vivacity and smartness. It noted that they sang three songs, one about a legal consultation between a young lady and a lawyer, the second concerning the clerical admirer of an actress, and the third about a theatrical agent and a variety artiste.",
