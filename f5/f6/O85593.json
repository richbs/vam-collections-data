Around the inside of the bowl are four pairs of seated figures, separated by arabesque motifs, in poses that suggest they are having a conversation.\n\nThe bowl has been decorated with enamel colours and gold painted over the glaze. The technique emerged in Iran in the 12th century. It was a revolutionary development in ceramic decoration that enabled potters to paint with more detail than ever before. The result was a whole genre of wares decorated with depictions of various human activities. There were scenes of people seated at court, hunting, playing polo, and even fighting in battles.",

This bowl represents type 3.  Mina'i wares share three main charactertistics; they are made with a white composite fabric; they are covered with an opaque white, or occasionally, an opaque turquoise glaze which reaches the edge of the foot outside and is applied separately in the vertical footring; thirdly, the polychrome colours are applied over the glaze. The use of gold on this bowl and the skilled painting of the figures links it to the finest example of mina'i known, fragments of a bowl decorated with scenes from Firdausi's Shahnamah in the Khalili Collection POT875. The figurative decoration on Iranian pottery of the 12th and 13th centuries, and mina'i in particular,  is thought to reflect a contemporary tradition of mural and manuscript painting.",
