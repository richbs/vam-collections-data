            "physical_description": "The whole is made of various wood; simple carved and polished. The main part is a rectangular block of wood shaped as an `n' with the slot running the length. Towards the front of the block is a light wood knob which is attached to a bar running the length of the slot and protruding out at the back. At the back end is an upright of light wood with a stripy  grain nailed on. It has a pair of arms on a wooden pegs and on the top is glued a `cat' shaped head with the face marked with black pen lines. Between the paws is a mask showing another `cat' face decorated in red; white and black to represent a growling cat with its mouth open. Pegged to the end of the protruding bar and glued into a small hole at the back of the right arm is a length of black thread. When the knob is depressed; the end of the bar lowers; pulls the thread which causes the arms and the mask to lift and cover the face of the cat's head changing its countenence from a happy to an angry face. The tail of the cat is a twisted length of black and white pipe cleaner glued into a hole in the back. \nROBERT RACE; born 1943.

ROBERT RACE 'Innocent toys; things of such dignity As we greet modern friends withal...' Antony & Cleopatra; Act V; sc. ii. I try to make things which move in simple but interesting ways. They are intended to appeal to both children and adults. I call them moving toys and simple automata. I use those terms very loosely. I greatly admire and enjoy the dynamic `folk' and `street' toys still made in many parts of the world; despite the relentless pressures toward mass production and  standardisation. In my own work I aspire firstly to their makers' vigorous imagery; secondly to their ingenious use of simple mechanisms; and thirdly to their active exploration and exploitation of the properties of\nthose natural and recycled materials that are readily and cheaply available in the locality.",
