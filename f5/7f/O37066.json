The elephant is sitting on a gold coloured seat with its nose pointing straight up and its front legs attached to the silver handlebars of the `cycle'. The cycle is represented only by the front piece and wheel. The elephant is white and grey with red, yellow black, blue and green markings. The wheel is gray with black, green and white and the ball is blue, red and yellow. Running through the elephant is a pole with the ball at the top. Attached to the ball are three cream tassels. When pulled along by the green plastic cord, the back wheels turn cogs which turn the post for the ball.  At the same time one of the cogs, with alternate spikes curled down connects with a wire trip which is bedded into a small paper covered box underneath the platform. As the trip wire is hit, a noise is made. Also when the ball is spinning the tassels flare out.",
