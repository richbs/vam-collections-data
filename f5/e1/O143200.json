            "public_access_description": "David Watkins began his career as a sculptor and jazz pianist. In the sixties he made his first attempts in jewellery and in the seventies he pioneered the use of computers as a design tool. Music and sculpture feed into his work, which is all about form, rhythm and colour, recently developing into abstract symbols and metaphors. Watkins' oeuvre developed from early miniature sculptures into large-scale wearable objects intended to interact with the body. The concept of art for the body is deeply embedded in his work. Watkins remains firmly committed to modernity.\n\nWatkins explores a wide range of materials, from paper and gold to industrial materials such as steel, aluminium and titanium. He stretches them to their aesthetic and technical limits. For him machine technologies bestow beauty, thus traditional craft and modern technologies can coexist without loss to one another. \n\nIn 1978, David Watkins and Wendy Ramshaw became Artists in Residence at the Western Australian Institute of Technology in Perth (now Curtin University) sponsored by the Australian Crafts Council.  \n\nDuring this period Watkins pursued new work in steel and gold recalling his family roots in the Black Country. His interest in blacksmithing techniques led his work into unexpected directions. For Watkins the most important result of his stay in Australia was a series of neckpieces made of tool steel no thicker than 2mm in diameter. The steel was lathe-turned, fabricated, and occasionally blued and embellished with gold inlay, as here in his neckpiece titled 'Square Neckpiece with Pendant Corners'. The designs are sophisticated and bear a baroque complexity. The compositions are graphic formed by a combination of interdependent forms: squares, triangles, loops and ladders are either permanently fixed or attached as free swinging elements moving independently. A number of beautifully rendered drawings accompany this series.",
