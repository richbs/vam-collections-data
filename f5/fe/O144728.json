The company has collected an archive containing many historical textiles and pattern books to provide its designers with inspiration.The motifs on this sample reveal a fascination with Persian or Islamic art. This textile was used as the covering fabric for the large published portfolio containing George P. Baker's 1922 study Calico Painting and Printing in the East Indies in the XVIIth and XVIIIIth Centuries, published in London by Edward Arnold, 1921.\n\nBy the 1920s, when this sample was made, avant-garde textile designers in Britain were particularly interested in severe, sparsely coloured, abstract and geometric designs. Although Bakers did not embrace the extremes of this style, the company did bring out an experimental range of purely geometric patterns.",
