It has been suggested that, as riding became less of a necessity and more of an aristocratic accomplishment, out-of-work riding masters turned from instruction to trick riding and exhibitions.  The most successful was Philip Astley, and this print shows one of his popular riding exhibitions at the Olympic Pavilion, which he had opened in 1806 and how the equestrian displays developed from being one trick rider into group displays of horsemanship. L'Ecole de Mars was possibly devised by Astley to show off his pupils, as his letter published in the Morning Herald, 27 November 1807, refers to some of the executants only having learned riding within the last three months.",
