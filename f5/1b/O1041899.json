            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, pp. 110, 111, 114\nThe following is an extract from the text of the entry:\n\nOn the back is a sketch-map, traced with a stilus and partly pencilled, of the roads from Ringwood, Hampshire to Osmington, Dorset.  One route passes through Poole, Lytchett Minster, Wareham, Wool, Winfrith and the other pursues a more northerly course; the directions of Christchurch and Sarum are indicated.  This map was no doubt used by Constable and his wife on their journey to spend their honeymoon with John Fisher at Osmington.  The drawing is the original sketch for Constable's etching of Netlet Abbey.  Holmes, p. 243, points this out and states that Constable made a study in oil from this drawing late in life, which was No. 9 in the exhibition at Messrs.Leggatt's, 1899.  This or a similar oil painting is reproduced by Beckett in his article 'Constable's Honeymoon' (<i>Connoisseur,</i> Vol. CXXIX, 1952, p. 4 and fig. II); compare also the late water-colour 'Netley Abbey by Moonlight', formerly in the Beckett collection, and exhibited at Manchester 1956 (No. 129).\nThis is a page from the same sketch book as Nos. 149 [606-1888], 151 [311-1888], 153 [303-1888], and 154 [791-1888].\n\nNotes on Nos. 147-154 [823-1888, 268-1888, 606-1888, 613-1888, 311-1888, 628-1888, 303-1888, 791-1888]\n\nNos. 147-154 [see above] were all drawn by Constable on his honeymoon.  He was married by John Fisher at St. Martin\u2019s-in-the-Fields on 2 October, and Fisher has invited the newly-married couple to stay at his vicarage at Osmington on the coast near Weymouth, in Dorsetshire.  The visit to Netley Abbey on 11 October, when Nos. 147 to 149 [823-1888, 268-1888, 606-1888] and probably also No. 150 [613-1888] were made, was probably undertaken from Southampton on the way down.  As Beckett suggests (<i>Connoisseur, loc. cit.</i>) the map on the back of No. 148 [268-1888] would be of use in journeying from Southampton to Osmington, and may also suggest a break of Journey at Ringwood.  The latest recorded date for a drawing made at Osmington is that on the back of our drawing No. 153 [303-1888] of 1 December.  No. 147 [823-1888] is drawn in the smaller sketch-book which Constable had used earlier in the year, from which No. 146 [233-1888] also comes.\nAlthough the hinge marks and the other obvious signs have been trimmed off Nos. 148, 149 [268-1888, 606-1888], and Nos. 151-154 [311-1888, 628-1888, 303-1888, 791-1888], there can be little doubt that these six sheets once formed part of the same sketch-book.  The trimming and cutting up of the sketch-book seems in this instance to have been carried out by the artist himself, since the inscriptions on the larger sketch-book pages on to which some of them are mounted (Nos. 149 [606-1888], 153 [303-1888] and 154 [791-1888]) are almost certainly in his hand.  Among other drawings which may come from the same sketch-book are: \u2018View of Osmington and the Downs with the figure of George III on horseback at Sutton Poyntz\u2019 (4 5/16 x 7 ins.) which was Lot 93 in the Gregory sale, 20 July 1949; \u2018Portland Roads\u2019 (4 7/8 x 7 ins.), then in the collection of R.B. Beckett (<i>Connoisseur, loc. cit., </i>fig. VII).  In the article cited Beckett discusses other drawings and oil sketches made at the time.  See also Beckett, VI, pp. 30-1 and plate 5.  An oil sketch of the coast with Portland Island in the distance, similar to the pencil drawings Nos. 151 [311-1888], 152 [628-1888], 154 [791-1888], and 154a [791-1888], is in the City Art Museum, St. Louis (reproduced in the Bulletin of that Museum, Vol. XIV, 1929, p. 8)",
