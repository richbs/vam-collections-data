Chute in 1867 and illustrates the innovative nature of his theatre interiors at this date.  It incorporates a figurative panel in the deep entablature above the proscenium opening, and this and the continuation of the front of the gallery tier on a continuous horizontal line, were features of the architectural handling of both the New Theatre Royal Bristol and the Queen's Theatre, Long Acre, London, deriving from Phipps's familiarity with the Vaudeville Theatre, Paris.\n\nThe frieze at Bristol was painted by Henry Holiday, and the act-drop, representing the interior of a Roman Villa, was painted by G. Gordon with some of the figures by William Harford.  Although the watercolour is not signed, it may well be by Phipps himself since he exhibited watercolours on several occasions.  In 1863 he exhibited a view of his Theatre Royal, Bath, and in 1867 views by him of a number of his theatres were selected for submission to the Paris Exhibition.",

Entitled 'Interior of the Queen's Theatre, Long Acre, London' it was attributed to the English School and dated 1850.  On  more than cursory examination of this watercolour it becomes clear that it does not depict the Queen's Theatre, although it displays many similarities with other views of the theatre, instead it depicts the interior of the New Theatre Royal, Bristol, designed by Charles J. Phipps for J.H. Chute in 1867.'",
