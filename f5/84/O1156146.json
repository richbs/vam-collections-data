He is leaning to his left, with a staff or spear in his right hand which he is pointing away from him. He is standing on a beach and mythical creatures are visible in the sea behind him.\n\nThis print was originally published in 1839 by A. Park in Leornard Street. it appeared on sheet number 6 accompanied by an image of Mr. H. Honner as the Fire King.\n\nTinsel prints were created from etched portraits of theatrical stars in popular roles they played on the London stage. They were hand-painted in watercolour and decorated with scraps of material and tinsel additions. They were popular during the first half of the 19th century and were considered an adult, rather than a child's hobby. By the 1830s it was possible to buy the tinsel, leather and feather ornaments to go with each image.",
