            "physical_description": "[Theatre costume] Bodice, from the bust to the serrated lower edge of black all-over sequin fabric, boned and fitted to suggest a breastplate, the serrated lower edge shaped over the hips, the points edged with black silk tape overlaid at the edge with a narrow band of silver Lurex and backed with black and silver Lurex brocade. The shoulders and cap sleeves of black cotton lace woven with silver Lurex diaper pattern. At front seam where the lace and sequinned fabric join are tapes and press studs to attach the garland. On either side of the back fastening are black taffeta casings for the wings. The bodice is lined with white cotton.\n[Theatre costume] Full-length skirt with slight train to back, of five layers of different fabrics and paddings, all gathered into a black cotton binding at the waist. The top layer of black cotton lace woven with a diaper pattern in silver Lurex, the hem cut into serrations, the lower part of the skirt lined with black net. Beneath is a full-length skirt of black and silver Lurex floral brocade with a serrated hem and beneath this are two full-length black net skirts and a narrow underskirt of pale pink-mauve art silk, all with serrated hems. To either side of the back opening, over the underskirt, are two pads covered in black net. Over the top layer hang six full-length narrow dagged panels of silver Lurex open meshed net edged with narrow grey silk braid overlaid at the edge with a line of silver Lurex. The panels have been broken down with black paint and are lined with black net. The skirt fastens at back with press studs and a hook and eye.\n[Theatre costume] Voluminous cloak of black and silver Lurex floral brocade, shaped and fitted onto a wide wired upstanding collar of 'flame' shapes of black cotton lace woven with a diaper pattern in silver Lurex stretched over a wire frame. Each 'flame' edged with a line of silver Lurex russia braid and sprinkled with large faceted silver sequins. The cloak is divided into a back and two side sections, each shaped into a broad point at the hem, the back point trailing on the ground. All hems cut into serrations edged with narrow grey silk braid overlaid at edges with a line of silver Lurex. Fixed down the centre of each section is a panel of horizontally striped black and silver Lurex brocade, the sides cut into bold pointed 'dags' and edged with narrow grey silk braid overlaid at the edge with a line of silver Lurex. The panels are stitched to the cloak down the centre, leaving the sides hanging. To either side of the centre back panel are two similarly cut and attached panels of the same fabric as the cloak, used in reverse and edged with narrow grey silk braid overlaid at the edge with a line of silver Lurex. All panels backed with black net. From the back of the shoulders, between the two outer panels, is a narrow panel of the black cotton lace with silver Lurex diaper pattern used in reverse, cut with narrow serrations at the edge and attached down the centre, as the other panels; above the panel are several small 'petals' of the same fabric, attached at the top corner only. The whole cloak is 'broken down' with black paint. \nThe cloak is unlined but the hem has a narrow facing of black net. At the back neck is a heavily wired loop to make the collar upstanding around the head. The heavy wire at the base of the collar continues into projecting pieces to which are attached black tape to tie across the neck.\n[Theatre costume] Pair of wings to fit into the casings on the back of the bodice. Each wing formed of wired shapes in the form of pointed 'flames', overlapping at base, over which is stretched black cotton lace woven with a diaper pattern in silver Lurex, each 'flame' being defined along the wire frame, inside and out, with narrow silver russia braid. The wings are scattered with black and silver faceted sequins.\n[Theatre costume] Long decorative garland to fix to bodice at the seam where the sequinned breastplate joins the black cotton lace covering the shoulders. At the back is a double box pleated frill of black marquisette, the edges of the lower frill being cut into spikes and the whole frill 'broken down' with grey paint. Down the centre of the frill is a line of rough pleated black cotton lace woven with a diaper pattern in silver Lurex, along which is a line of diamant\u00e9 studs in silver filigree mounts. Across the centre front is a row of six 'flowers', each of six petals of black stiffened leatherettte set with a smaller petal of silver Lurex brocade, each having towards the centre a diamant\u00e9 stud set in a silver filigree mount. On the back of each shoulder a similar flower. On the back are tapes and press studs to fix the garland to the bodice.\n[Theatre costume] Tight fitted sleeve with sharp point over the hand, the sleeve reaching to above the elbow and fastening at the wrist with hooks and eyes. Sleeve of black cotton lace woven with a diaper pattern in silver Lurex and lined with black nylon and, over the wrist and hand, pink art silk.

Velcro fastening at back.\n[Theatre costume] Wig of grey-black curls, the crown covered with a snood of silver latticed russia braid, set at each intersection with a diamant\u00e9 stud in a silver filigree mount, on net base\n[Theatre costume] Small coronet with cap of black velvet. The rim is set with two rows of diamant\u00e9 studs, above which is a row of black plaited russia braid scattered with small black sequins, and, above this, a row of silver Lurex  braid. The rim is trimmed with grey fake fur. From the rim rise four stiff arches covered in black and silver Lurex braid over which are set florets of black plastic with minute nodule finish, each centred with a diamant\u00e9 stud and scattered with iridescent black sequins. Between each arch is a wire triangle set with a small black floret, as on the arches, surmounted by a single black bead. The coronet is surmounted by a finial; the stem, covered in black plaited russia braid, supporting a 'ball' covered in black seed-shaped beads with a line of diamant\u00e9 studs around its circumference.

            "public_access_description": "In 1977 Queen Elizabeth II celebrated 25 years on the throne. The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company contributed to the festivities by staging a Silver Jubilee Season at Sadler's Wells, the highlight being a new production of  Iolanthe with silver-themed designs by Bruno Santini. Gilbert and Sullivan's 1882 Savoy opera mocks the House of Lords within a tale of fairy folk and mortals who struggle with a typically Gilbertian plot contrivance that impedes the course of true love.  Sullivan's music incorporates references to contemporary Grand Opera and the first production presented the Queen of the Fairies as a substantial lady in a breastplate and Wagnerian helmet, whose claim to have swung upon on a cobweb was amusingly unlikely. Subsequent productions have maintained this tradition by making the Queen into a parody of Br\u00fcnnhilde.\n\nReviewers of the 1977 production were slightly disappointed that the Fairy Queen was, in the words of the Financial Times critic, 'trim of appearance, prettily dressed and not at all ridiculous'. Her costume is a riot of black and silver synthetic fabrics, designed to shimmer under the stage lights. The bodice is shaped to suggest a breastplate but is covered in shining black sequins so that the Queen retains her femininity. Santini gave the fairies the traditional tiny wings of the Victorian imagination but the Queen's are a stylish black lace to match the rest of her outfit. They slot into the back of the bodice and were not worn with the cloak but they mirror the 'flame' shapes of the cloak's high wired collar. Along with the choker necklace in the style of a ruff and the tightly curled wig, the collar hints at the Elizabethan period, an appropriate reference for a production marking the second Elizabeth's Jubilee.",
