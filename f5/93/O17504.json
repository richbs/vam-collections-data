The painting depicts a tiger hunt at Jhajjar, Rohtak District, Panjab and dates to about 1855. Nearly all of the figures and some of the elephants are inscribed with their names in small Persian characters. In the centre of the hunt can be seen Nawab Muhammad Abd al-Rahman Khan (r. 1845-57) on horseback spearing a tiger, and on the horizon is a line of elephants carrying dead tigers and a deer. The nawab owned Jhajjar, Badli and Karaund. He rebelled during the so-called 'Indian Mutiny' (also known as the First War of Indian Independence) and was executed by the British in Delhi on 23 December, 1857.",
