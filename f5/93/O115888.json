Nor is the present gilding original. Conservation reports from December 1991 are on the Acquisition RPs (91/2154). An inscription on the base cover (W.7:2-1991) reads: \"John King [?stuft] this stool July 11th 1821 for Messr. Baily &amp; Sanders [sic] Mount St. London footstool for the Crowning Chair.\"\n\nThe footstool was supplied for the Coronation of George IV at Westminster Abbey on 20th July 1821. It is possible that it was designed by Benjamin Dean Wyatt, Surevyor of the Fabric for the Abbey betweeen 1813 and 1827. The carved lions were intended to match those on St Edward's Chair (the Coronation Throne), the restoration of which was carried out at the same time by Wyatt's cousin, Edward Wyatt.\n\nThe original invoice from Bailey and Saunders survives in the Lord Chamberlain's papers in the PRO (LC 2/5, fo. 39):\nTo a richly carved footstool, with Lions to Correspond\nwith saint Edward's chair, Stuffed in Canvas\n&amp; covered with white Calico    \u00a339 18s\nTo covering ditto with the Office Gold Tissue correspond    \u00a31 2s\nTo making a loose Cover for ditto    8s\nTo a brown holland Cover for Ditto    9s6d\n\nThe covering for the footstool (and St Edward's Chair) was provided by the silk mercer William King: \"18 Yds Gold Frosted Tabby % 7/7d 135-1s-1d\" (PRO LC 2/50 fo.39) and the fringe by Thomas Charlton (LC 2/50 fo.51-2).\n\nThe history of the stool between 1821 and 1991 is unrecorded. The Lord Chamberlain, Lord Hertford, did not claim it as a perquisite, as was traditional, in 1821. Sir George Naylor published an illustrated record of the Coronation of George IV which included drawings of St Edward's Chair and the present footstool (p. 45, 1837 edition).\n\nReferences\n\nNaylor, Sir George, The Coronation of His Most Sacred Majesty King George the Fourth, second (enlarged) edition, London 1837, pl.s 38 and 45.\n\nColllard, Frances, 'The Coronation Footstool of George IV' in Art Quarterly, September 1992.",
