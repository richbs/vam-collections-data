Within six months the company had stumbled sideways into the bizarre world of poster and novelty design.'\n\n'Initially rejected as 'to[sic] controversial' the Colour Chart was seized upon by GB Posters [& Publications] and has gone on to be a best seller and cultural icon with appearances in media as diverse as Men Behaving Badly, Radio 1 and The Guardian.'\n\n'The fictional company \"Takischitt\" originally created specifically for the Colour Chart Poster has gone on to spawn a range of posters, novelties and one of the funniest web sites on the internet (www.takischitt.co.uk)'.\n\n'Takischitt' is an anarchic subversion of a paint colour chart, using tubular format in the same way as other conceptual art (for example 'The Great Bear' by Simon Patterson - E.1842-1992), which challenges traditional diagrams and information systems. The poster sold 41,000 copies in its first year.",
