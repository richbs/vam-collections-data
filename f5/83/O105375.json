            "public_access_description": "The history of the Frisbie is a quite a fun one.  The story starts with an American pie company.  The Frisbie Baking Company (1871-1958) made pies for many schools and colleges.  The pies were served in pie tins with the words Frisbie's Pies embossed inside. Students discovered that it was fun to toss these pie tins at each other as they flew easily through the air.  These students may have been the first to throw the Frisbie but it was Walter Frederick and Warren Fanscioni who invented the first plastic Frisbie in 1948.  After the partnership broke up Morrison when on to produce a plastic Frisbie called the Pluto Platter, reflecting the interest in UFOs. The original design is still popular today and the outer third of the Frisbie is known as the Morrison slope.  Morrison sold the design rights to a company called Wham-O.  After a few years they renamed the Pluto Platter, Frisbee after the original Frisbie Baking Company to help increase sales.  Today the Frisbee is still a popular toy seen in parks and on the beach.  There is even a professional sporting game known as Frisbee Golf.",
