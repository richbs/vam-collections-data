The horse is cream with black spots and orange and brown trim. On its back is attached a metal `saddle' shape. The clockwork mechanism is housed in the body with the key bar protruding at the right side. When wound the front legs spring forward and the whole appears to leap. \n2. rider is of a plastic material; possibly Elastolin and it may have been made by HAUSER. It is designed to sit on a peg in the back but fits into the saddle. The right arm is raised and holds a loop of thread. It is painted blue; white; red; beige and brown; with black and white trim. *There are no marks and the rider appears to be of the same material as that of B173-1994. However; it is possible that it is a copy; perhaps Japanese.",
