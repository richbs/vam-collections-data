The \u2018Moor\u2019s Head\u2019 emblem, in which a black head wearing a narrow headband is presented in profile, has existed since the middle ages. Its origins may lie in the invasion of Spain and Portugal in 711 by African and Arab Muslim forces led by General Tariq ibn-Ziyad. It is an image of nobility, one much used in European heraldry.",
