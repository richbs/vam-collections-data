            "public_access_description": "The Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations, popularly known as the Great Exhibition, was held in London from 1 May to 11 October, 1851. It was an imperial spectacle in which the manufactures and raw materials of more than thirty British colonies and dependencies were displayed to demonstrate the commercial and artistic wealth of Britain\u2019s colonial possessions and to re-invigorate British design. Key to the success of the Exhibition was Joseph Paxton\u2019s revolutionary glass building; the Crystal Palace. \n\nThe building and displays drew over six million visitors to the Exhibition and generated a booming trade in souvenirs and commemorative items. This transfer-printed plate was produced as an affordable souvenir. It pictures an \u2018interior view of the Crystal Palace\u2019. The \u2018exotic\u2019 visitors in national dress in the foreground promote a vision of the Exhibition as a place where people and goods from around the world could be united under the banner of the British Empire.",
