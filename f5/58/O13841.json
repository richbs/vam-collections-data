Trimmed with blue silk bows which are bordered with clear glass beaded braid and silk fringe. A similar line of trimming is stitched across the bodice to suggest a yoke. There are harmonising glass stud buttons. Lined with cotton. Two small bones at the waist darts  and on the side seams.\n\nThe separate skirt is gored and has a small train. It is pleated with the folds arranged so that they run from the centre-front double box pleat with inverted pleats at its sides towards the centre back.",

The contours of the crinoline have altered from a bell shape to a profile that is fairly flat in front, with the bulk of volume at the back. The Englishwoman\u2019s Domestic Magazine of 1865 reported the change as follows: \u2018Dresses incline more and more to the Princess Shape. All the widths are gored, the skirt is scant and short at the front and forms a long sweeping train at the back.\u2019 The subtle stripes of grey, blue and black are left unadorned, except for a bugle bead and silk fringe which decorates the bodice, the edge of the collar and the over-sleeves.",
