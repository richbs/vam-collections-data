Perfume test cards - which are sprayed with a sample for customers to take away - are often used by retailers as a promotional tool. This one advertises Ralph Lauren, a fragrance licensed by fashion designer Ralph Lauren.\n\nRalph Lauren is an American fashion designer, born in 1939,  New York City as Ralph Lipschitz. He began his career by creating neckties under the name Polo for Beau Brummel. In 1968 he created a men's wear line under the Polo name. Since then, he has branched out into tailored shirts for women, boy's clothes, and women's ready-to-wear fashions in fabrics such as English flannel, Harris tweeds, silk, and cashmere. His name appears on such diverse products as men's wear, home furnishings, tableware, and luggage. He designed the costumes for the films The Great Gatsby (1974) and Annie Hall (1977). His look is traditional, luxurious, and casual. His collections have inspired interest in the American West and American country styles.",
