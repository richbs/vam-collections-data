The South Kensington Museum (now the V&A) commissioned him to provide designs for large figure panels and other decorations for the Dutch Kitchen. (This is now called the Grill Room.) His lively drawing of the human figure gives a sense of life and movement to the conventional series of the Twelve Months. Students in the women's section of the School of Design at South Kensington painted the tile panels.\n\nThe Refreshment Rooms were opened during 1868. They consisted of three rooms, the central room, now known as the Gamble Room,  which has a semi-circular northern side, following the plan of the Lecture Theatre above it; and a smaller, square room on either side, the Grill Room to the east and the Green Dining Room to the west, now known as the Poynter Room. \n \nPoynter was Director of the National Art Training School and women artists from the school painted his designs onto blank tiles supplied by Minton, the ceramic manufacturer.  Henry Scott, a Royal Engineer officer employed on building the new Museum, compiled a list of the women he was employing as porcelain painters.  They were Amy E. Black, Miss Walker, Miss Judd, Miss Earle, Miss Hall, Miss Cambridge, who were all paid at the rate of 6d an hour, except Amy Black who received 9d.",
