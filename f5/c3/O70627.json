Christ is led with a rope tied round his waist and held by a bearded figure, wearing a short girded tunic, who looks back at him, pulling the cross with his right hand. Christ is pushed forward by a similar figure on the left of the panel, who holds a bill in his right hand. Four similar figures are found at the top of the panel, including one holding a halberd and another holding a hammer. St. John the Evangelist is shown at the top left of the panel holding a palm. \n\nThe top of the panel is badly chipped. The surface of the panel is badly weathered. There are slight traces of gilding on Christ's hair and on the background at the top of the panel.\n\nThere are two holes drilled in the back of the panel, one plugged with lead. The whole of the centre of the panel has been scooped away, and the bottom has been cut away even more.",

The left arm of the cross is supported with both hands by the Virgin who is shown wearing a gown and veil. Christ is led with a rope tied round his waist and held by a bearded figure, wearing a short girded tunic, pulling the cross with his right hand. Christ is pushed forward by a similar figure on the left of the panel, who holds a bill in his right hand. \n\nThere are two sorts of alabaster. Calcite alabaster is very hard and was used in ancient times. This object is made of gypsum alabaster which is a fine-grained, soft and smooth stone. Although at first glance it looks a little like marble, which it was intended to imitate, it was much easier to carve due to its softness, and alabaster objects were therefore significantly cheaper to produce. Marble does not originate in England, so it was imported if needed, whereas in the 15th century there were important alabaster quarries in Nottingham, York, Burton-on-Trent and London. England was a major centre for the production of objects such as this one. During period, they were exported in very large numbers to Europe where they survive, unlike many examples which remained in England and were destroyed or greatly damaged during the Reformation.",
