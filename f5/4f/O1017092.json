The sheet is composed of two pieces of paper, joined where they overlap with sealing wax forming an L shape. This is a sketch by Chambers, presumably prepared on site as the basis of the design process. The inscriptions and pencil additions indicate proposed alterations and an extension across the complete width of the west front. The wing in the south western corner is shown in a truncated form so that the proposed western fa\u00e7ade becomes symmetrical.\n\nChambers was born in Sweden and died in London. He travelled widely, visiting China, and studied architecture at the Ecole des Arts, Paris, from 1749 and in Italy from 1750 to 1755.  Many of his drawings from this period are contained in his important 'Franco-Italian' album, held in the V&A.  Chambers moved to London in 1755 and published his influential Treatise on Civil Architecture in 1759.  Chambers demonstrated the breadth of his style in buildings such as Gower (later Carrington) House and Melbourne House, London, in such country houses as Duddingston, Scotland, and in the garden architecture he designed for Wilton House, Wiltshire, and at Kew Gardens. He became head of government building in 1782, and in this capacity built Somerset House, London.",
