To produce a collodion positive, a sheet of glass is hand-coated with a thin film of collodion (guncotton dissolved in ether) containing potassium iodide, and sensitised to the light with silver nitrate to create a collodion negative. The back is then painted black or covered with a piece of dark cardboard or cloth in order to achieve the effect of a positive image.\n\nThese collodion positive prints are separately mounted side by side in a union case, with highly decorative gilt frames. Union cases were introduced in 1854. Unlike most daguerreotype and ambrotype cases which were made of leather, these were produced from thermoplastic, and were often moulded with designs. This was one of the earliest commercial uses of plastic.",
