Her career as a jeweller came later however, after marriage and a family, with a studio first in Glasgow then out in Kirkcudbright.  She was a member of the Glasgow Society of Lady Artists' Club and her jewellery won one of their prizes in 1925. An interview with her in The Glasgow Herald (18 May 1939) describes her studio in the garden, with its bench surrounded by shelves of tools and materials at which she sat on an old windsor chair. The journalist remarks on her 'fine colour sense' which is also a feature of this particular brooch. Its rich but unusual combination of stones fits well with her remark that 'in the drawers a heterogeneous collection of gems from all over the world was mixed in an entrancing disorder'.",
