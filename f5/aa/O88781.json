Conical ceramic tiles were inserted into the stone and mortar walls of the stoves in order to increase the radiation of heat. By the 15th century these stoves were replaced by others with walls built entirely of inter-connecting ceramic tiles. Earlier  examples, such as this one, used niche-type tiles, but by the 16th century most stoves were constructed from rectangular panel-type tiles. \n\nThe typical late medieval tile-stove took the form of a large rectangular fire-box, supported on masonry or legs, and topped by a tower to provide a greater surface for the radiation of heat. Though essentially free-standing, the stove would be positioned against a wall in which openings had been cut to connect to a stoke-hole and flue at its rear. This allowed the stove to be stoked directly from an adjacent room, and for fumes to be extracted. The cleanliness of the room in which the stove itself was situated was thus ensured.",
