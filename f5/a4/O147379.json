Resist-dyeing involves treating certain areas of the cloth with a \u2018resist\u2019 to prevent them absorbing the dye; in this example starch has been used. It has been applied through a metal stencil, in some areas the starch has been thickly applied and then scraped away with a comb to create a pattern.  Although adire cloths were usually made by women those made using mental stencils were generally produced by men.\n\nTwo lengths of cloth have been sewn together to form a shape that is roughly square so it could be used as a wraparound skirt.  Adire was not a prestigious form of cloth but it was extremely popular during the early 1960s when this example was bought for the museum in the city of Ibadan in south-western Nigeria.",
