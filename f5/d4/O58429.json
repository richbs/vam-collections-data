He returned to Britain in 1775 and found many of his countrymen eager for romantic views of ancient and historic buildings. Hodges had been a pupil of Richard Wilson (?1713-1782), whose treatment of landscape strongly influenced the next generation of artists, particularly J.M.W. Turner (1775-1851).\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThis view of Ludlow Castle was a typical product of the demand for pictures showing atmospheric ruins or part ruins from the romantic past. Ludlow Castle was initially built between 1086 and 1094, one of the last castles ordered to be built by William the Conqueror to protect his English kingdom following the Norman Conquest. As Ludlow was located on the border with an independent  Wales, it was a site of major strategic importance. Many battles and sieges in the turbulent history of Britain subsequently took place here, right up to the Civil Wars in the mid-17th century. After that date it fell into increasingly picturesque decay.",
