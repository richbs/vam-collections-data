A lithograph is a picture made by printing from a flat surface (traditionally stone, now often a metal plate), on which the artist draws or paints the original design with a greasy substance like chalk. The surface is next prepared, moistened and inked; the greasy printing ink adheres to the design, which is then printed onto a sheet of paper.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nFor this poster The Beggarstaffs (brothers-in-law James Pryde and William Newzam Prior Nicholson) designed the image of a Yeoman of the Guard, or Beefeater.  They thought it might be suitable as an advertisement for beef extract or for a theatrical production. However, it was eventually bought by the proprietors of Harper's Magazine (founded in the USA in 1850), who reproduced it widely to publicise their magazine. \n\nThe Beggarstaffs insisted on retaining artistic control over their design, hand-painting the lettering of the text, and harmoniously incorporating the text panel into the main design by extending the red background into a strip around it.  Even their signature is part of the design. The use of a single dramatic image (the yeoman, seen from behind, with his lance cutting diagonally across the picture frame), and of broad areas of flat colour is typical of their work.",

James Ferrier Pryde & Sir William Newzam Nicholson) created  their Yeoman of the Guard [Beefeater] design as a speculative poster, originally  thinking it would make a good advertisement for extract of beef, or for Gilbert &  Sullivan's opera 'The Yeoman of the Guard'. Rejected for both purposes, the  design was sold by The Artistic Supply Company to Harper's of New York (a  pioneer of the artistic poster) who used it to advertise the European edition of  their magazine. The Beggarstaffs insisted on designing the lettering as well as the  image of the poster, and when it was posted up (all over Britain) , it triggered  much favourable and critical comment for its bold, unconventional composition.",
