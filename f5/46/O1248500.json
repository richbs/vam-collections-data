Together with his wife, Lucienne Day, he actively introduced and promoted modernist design in Britain in the second half of the 20th century. Typically for this optimistic period, they intended a broad reach rather than a luxury market and worked with manufacturer's like Hille and department store Heals. \n\nThe<i> Royal Festival Hall Lounge Chair</i> represents Day's active engagement with the <i>Festival of Britain</i> in 1951 and part of his contribution to the major Festival Hall project. Having graduated in the late 1930s and early 1940s, Robin Day had set up his studio and gained valuable working experience. The Festival, in particular the <i>Homes and Gardens Pavilion</i> provided a welcome opportunity to show work. But more importantly, Robin Day was commissioned to design furniture for the Royal Festival Hall which is claimed to have marked a turning point in his career. Day had to respond to a complex brief, including not only furniture for the foyer and restaurant but auditorium and orchestra. This chair is a prototype of the not quite final design and, as such, of great interest to the Museum.  It is a highly significant piece of plywood design in Britain and clearly influenced (as was all the Day's work, as well as their professional personae) by the American designers Charles and Ray Eames.",
