It was part of a large set of seat furniture, which included a second couch, six armchairs, a window seat and two sofas. The pair of couches may have been placed facing one other to either side of a fireplace, with the higher end against the wall.\n\nTime\nClassical designs, like this couch, were very fashionable from around 1800-1810. In 1803 the designer Thomas Sheraton (1751-1806) published a design for a 'Grecian Squab', or Classical couch, in The Cabinet Dictionary, an influential source for furniture makers and their clients. In 1805 Gillow & Co. of Lancaster and London made this example for the Reverend Edward Hughes and another couch for the Marquess of Sligo.\n\nPeople\nThe Reverend Edward Hughes (1738-1815) became a wealthy man through exploitation of a copper mine on the Parys Mountain, Anglesey, which he partly owned. He commissioned the architect Samuel Wyatt (1737-1807) to design Kinmel Park, Denbighshire, Wales for him (built 1790-1810), and subsequently ordered a large set of seat furniture, including this couch, from Gillow & Co. for his new house.",
