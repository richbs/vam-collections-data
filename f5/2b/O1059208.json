The lilac wash background, floated wet-in-wet, seems simultaneously to look forward to Alexander Cooper and backward again to the Hilliard/Isaac Oliver tradition, and provides some insight into the sort of stylistic matrix from which Alexander Cooper emerged. According to the entry in Sandrart which is usually and surely rightly taken to indicate Alexander Cooper, he was 'Olivierii hujus discipulus longe celeberrimus .. .', - 'by far the most celebrated pupil/ follower of Oliver': (1) and according to Houbraken he had 'de Konst geleerd by eenen Olivier een Engelsman' - 'learnt the art from one Oliver an Englishman\" (2) Attribution to the young Alexander Cooper may therefore be a possibility if and when more evidence of his early style emerges. \n\n1 Joachirn von Sandrart, <i>Academia Noblissimae Artis Pictoriae</i> (Niirnberg, 1683), p. 312. \n2 Arnold Houbraken, <i>De Groote Schouburgh der Nederlantsche Konstschilders en Schilderessen ... een Vervolg op het Schilderboek van K. v.
