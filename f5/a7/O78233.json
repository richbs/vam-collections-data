The engraving is made by transferring ink held in the lines onto a sheet of paper.\n\nPlace\nThis print shows Marylebone Gardens in a district of London, north of Oxford Street, known as Marylebone. Marylebone Gardens were built up into a fashionable pleasure garden after nearby Mayfair was developed in the mid 18th century. Marylebone Gardens were modelled on Spring Gardens, Vauxhall. On the right a bandstand is visible and on the left is an assembly room for public breakfasts and concerts in wet weather.\n\nWell-to-do residents of country houses in Marylebone High Street would have visited Marylebone Gardens. The proprietors took steps to prevent their wealthy customers from being robbed on the way home by providing them with escorts for part of the way.\n\nPeople\nThe leading singers and musicians of the day performed for visitors at Marylebone Gardens. When his companion complained to George Frideric Handel about the quality of a particular piece of music, the composer is reported to have replied, 'You are right Mr Fountayne, it is very poor stuff. I thought so myself when I had finished it.'\n\nFood\nAround 1751 Mr Trusler, who was a professional cook, became manager of the gardens. His daughter's rich seed and plum cakes and almond cheese cakes became known as Marylebone Gardens specialities.",
