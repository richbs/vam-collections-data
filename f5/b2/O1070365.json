Full Citation: \n \n\"<b>22 Unknown Man</b> \n<b>c.1625</b> \nFA 679\n\n<b>Oval 46 x 38mm</b> \n\nFeatures in very short fine hatches of grey, becoming thicker and harder in the beard and hair-line, with dark blue for the eyes and red for the lips, over a pale pinkish carnation ground; the collar in opaque white over a pale brown wash; the doublet in black wash, finely lined and hatched in gold for the decoration; on vellum put down on pasteboard prepared with a deep coat of gum (see Condition). \n \n<b>Condition:</b> The background largely repainted in several stages and apparently some enhancement to the colour of the eyes and lips. Extensive losses in the costume; the collar and face disfigured by spots of darkened gum penetrating the ground. The highly unconventional method of preparing the card in this miniature (if it is original) seems to have increased its vulnerability to a traumatic though unrecorded accident, possibly in course of conservation at the Museum, involving sufficient water to loosen the bond between paint and the card in the upper and left parts of the oval. Early Museum photographs show an intact signature and the background in a deteriorated but still largely authentic state.  \n \n<b>Signed:</b> Formerly signed in gold, centre left: <i>IH</i>. Traces of this signature remain at the very edge of the discoloured retouch, centre left. The back still bears its original museum numbering: <i>No 679/FineArt.</i>  \n \n<b>Frame:</b> Nineteenth-century gilt-brass oval rim, of V-section, holding a convex glass in a rebate at the front; the back closed by a toothed copper strip.  \n \n<b>Provenance:</b> Henry Hodgkinson; purchased by the Museum through a Mrs Clarke, May 1868. Hodgkinson was the half-brother of John Everett Millais, the eldest son by his mother's first marriage. Mrs Clarke may have been the wife of C Purdon Clarke, who ultimately became Director of the Museum.  \n \n<b>Literature:</b> <i>L'Art</i>, XVI (1879), p. 291, n. 2, reproduced from a drawing by John Watkins and wrongly said to have come from the Plumley Collection; <i>Catalogue of Miniatures</i>, 1908, p. 21, fig. 9 (the form of the signature carefully transcribed); Foster 1914-16, vol. 11, p. 148, no. 212; Long 1929, p. 224 (still recording the presence of the signature); Long 1930, p. 36 (still as signed); <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 31 (as formerly signed). \n\nA note by Reynolds in the department copy of Long 1930 records that the signature was not visible on 4 January 1974. The portrait is now of course a wreck, but it was evidently once a fine work, datable on costume c.1625-9.1 It represents one aspect of Hoskins' output of the middle 1620s, a style which tends to be bright, the features clearly focused and full of contrast, marked with an almost granular dark stipple in the beard, moustache and along the hair-line. It is a style usually reserved to characterise men of fairly dark complexion; compare Dudley, 3rd Baron North; 1 see also James I (Cat. No. 21.) \n\n1 According to Avril Hart who comments: 'Hair still quite short, only just touching the falling band; brushed away from face. Lace - probably bobbin, 1620s, Flemish: the falling ruff fashionable for 1615 to 1630. \nThe doublet appears to be of silk with woven rather than embroidered decoration. Epaulettes also appear to be quite long and would be consistent with 1620s styles.' Long put the date slightly earlier, at c.1622 (Long 1929, p.224). \n2 Not catalogued here: lent by the National Gallery to the NPG Reynolds 1952, pl. VII (repro.).\"",
