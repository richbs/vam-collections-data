            "public_access_description": "Snuff, or powdered tobacco, was widely popular throughout Europe from the 17th century. Sniffed from the back of the hand, from pinched fingers or from a spoon, snuff was enjoyed on social occasions and would be placed on the table or passed around a group. Thousands of small portable boxes to contain the powder, were made as personal accessories, often in novel designs, to be given as gifts.\n\nShoe and boot shaped snuff boxes were made throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. Shoes have long been associated with love and marriage and were often given for good luck. This carved wooden snuff box is in the shape of a much earlier shoe than most produced in this period. The sloping heel, square buckle and upturned toe are all features of footwear from the 18thcentury. The top of the shoe is hollowed out to form a container for the snuff, which is secured by a sliding lid. The lack of metal adornment and small size of this box suggest that it was made to be carried as a personal accessory, rather than placed on a dinner table.",
