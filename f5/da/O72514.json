The traditional Japanese garment, the kimono, had no pockets, so men first used the inro to carry daily necessities. From the late 1500s onwards, men wore it suspended from their sashes by a silk cord and netsuke (toggle). However, it rapidly became a costly fashion accessory of little or no practical use. \nInro subjects often reflect a particular festival or time of year. This one probably refers to Tanabata (Weaver's Festival), which was celebrated on the seventh day of the seventh month. The festival celebrates the annual meeting of the Weaver Princess Star and the Herdboy Star. According to legend, the princess and the herdboy fell in love and were allowed to marry. However, they soon began to neglect their duties and were separated to opposite sides of the Milky Way. They were allowed to meet only once a year at Tanabata. This inro is decorated with a silk-winder, which represents the Weaver Princess Star. The milky-white ground represents the Milky Way.",
