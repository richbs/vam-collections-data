There is a central sun with a human face [called 'khorshid'] with black hair.  There is a 'gold' circle between each ray.  The same image, but smaller, is repeated in the border.  Pairs of serrated leaves enclose the face.  These are linked with a 'gold' rosette between the faces, either side of which is a floral sprig.  There is a diagonal floral stem in each corner.  There is a faded chenille thread in every face.  The field of the central panel  is covered with a balanced pattern of intertwining stems and leaves with large and small flowers.  There is a band between the central panel and the border: gold ground with a fine meander and red and purple flowers.\nThe embroidery is worked through an interlining of plain weave cotton.  Yellow silk has been used to couch the 'gold' thread and white silk has been used to couch the 'silver' thread.\nApart from the black detail in the faces, all the coloured silks have metal thread worked through them.\nEmbroidery Threads: 2S-plied silk: black, red, green, mauve, orange, light blue, purple, grey; some chenille thread faded to beige.\nMetal thread: silver-gilt strip close S-wound around a cream silk core and silver strip S-wound around a white silk core.\nBacking: red silk with a slight yellow stripe.\nFacing: striped satin: [1] green edged on either side with cream and with an isolated motif brocaded with metal thread [silver strip open wound on a green silk core]; [2] dark olive green silk warp brocaded with the same metal thread creating a scale-like pattern with flower heads.",
