Compare case of Oliver, Cat. No.10.  \n \n<b>Provenance:</b> Probably the Dukes of Montrose, sold at Christie's 30 April 1895, lot 162, 'Portrait of a Gentleman', bt Durlacher, 98gns; George Salting, (1) by whom bequeathed to the Museum, 1910.  \n \n<b>Literature:</b> Long 1930, p. 93 (as Anon., <i>Supposed Portrait of William, 2nd Duke of Hamilton</i>); Reynolds 1959, pl. VI; <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 9 (as Alexander Cooper, <i>A Man, said to be 2nd Duke of Hamilton</i>). \n\nGeorge Salting (or perhaps Durlacher and the trade before Salting bought the miniature) identified the sitter as William Douglas, 3rd Duke of Hamilton; no attempt at attribution was made.   \n \nLong pointed out that William Douglas, 3rd Duke, was born in 1634 (actually 24 December 1635), so could not be the sitter for this portrait, which is datable on costume to the later 1630s. But this William Douglas was the husband of Anne, <i>suo jure</i> Duchess of Hamilton, daughter of the 1st Duke and sister of William, 2nd Duke, who was killed at the Battle of Worcester. The dates of the 2nd Duke (1616-51) were compatible with the miniature, which would, if it were correctly identified, show him at about the age of twenty. Long already knew an image identified as the 2nd Duke, a miniature from the Sackville Bale Collection shown at South Kensington in 1865 (no. 1644), which he thought to be closely comparable to (if not identical with) this miniature. He therefore deduced that the suggestion of the 3rd Duke was merely a careless slip for the 2nd.  \n \nBut the chain of reasoning is not good. The accepted portraits of the 2nd Duke date from after his brother's execution in March 1648/9. They include a double portrait with the Duke of Lauderdale (whom he accompanied on the Scottish invasion of England in 1650-1) by Cornelius Jonson (1649); (2) and a single portrait by Hanneman painted in Holland before Hamilton left with Charles II on his final campaign.(3) Both are too late to support the present miniature on grounds of likeness alone.  \n \nEarlier (25 November 1919) Long had also considered a suggestion that the sitter was Charles Louis, Count Palatine (for whose image see Cat. No. 55). He looked at prints in Heath 1905 and Granger 1769 and at two miniatures in the Buccleuch Collection, both supposed to be Charles Louis. Rejecting the suggestion, he commented: 'I think all 3 mins., vis P 140-1910 & these 2 in the Buccleuch Collection are by the same hand. The two in the Buccleuch Collection were both put down to Peter Oliver in A MacKay's catalogue of the Montague House miniatures,'(4) A week later he added: 'I think all these 3 miniatures are by a foreign hand, and am inclined to ascribe them to Jean Petitot.' (5)  \n \nLong's view of Petitot included the hypothesis that his oeuvre contained 'orthodox' water-colour miniatures in the English manner - thus, for example, the Catherine Howard (Hoskins, Cat. No. 28) could be accepted as by Petitot on the grounds that signed enamel versions of the same image were known. Here, however, the attribution was stylistic, and as such is hard to understand. The fundamental perception that the style was foreign was fairly compatible with MacKay's attribution of the group to Peter Oliver, so Long's suggestion was not really necessary on that score. Furthermore, the use of table-book leaf (6) in the 1630s probably still seemed a foreign practice, one to which Peter Oliver and his circle were by then more prone than other miniaturists. The obvious candidate, whose style was similarly 'foreign', was Alexander Cooper.  \n \nIt was Graham Reynolds (7) who first attributed the miniature, purely on stylistic grounds, to Alexander Cooper, and this is surely right. \n\n1 Salting Collection, no. 4655. \n2 Photo SNPG; also a version at Ham House. \n3 Signed and dated 1650, Royal Collection; a copy is in the NPG (Piper 1963, p. 153). \n4 MS note in department files, dated 25 November 1919. \n5 2 December 1919. \n6 On the introduction of these gesso-prepared tablets, see under Gerbier.\n7 In an undated MS note in the department copy of Long 1930.\u201d",
