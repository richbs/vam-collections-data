In his first year as a designer, Beene became known for his highly constructed, 'architectural' dresses but during the late 1960s he also turned to popular culture for inspiration and introduced touches of whimsy into his designs. However, by the early 1970s, Beene recognised that the comfort, affordability and classic styling of sportswear were the way of the future. Consequently Beene created new designs of softly draped, loosely constructed separate pieces that gently suggested the body beneath. In this dress from the 1990s, Beene translated gingham (a textile commonly associated with day wear) for evening by using taffeta instead of cotton and by applying beadwork to the neckline.",
