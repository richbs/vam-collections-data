His artistic style developed while at art college in Croydon, where he was influenced by the ideas of the avant-garde political group, the Situationist International. The political slant to his art was aroused by the May 1968 Paris student riots, which inspired fraternal protests organised by Reid at the Croydon College of Art. These were directed with fellow student Malcolm McLaren, who would later become the manager of the Sex Pistols.\n\nThis acetate was the artwork designed when Virgin Records decided to release a 'best-of' compilation album of Sex Pistols works in 1980. Reid saw this as exploitation of the defunct band and hastily drew up this artwork. It was to be printed over the front cover designs of the Pistols' first (Never Mind the Bollocks...) and second (The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle) albums, which would combine to be the front and back covers of the album. This design was printed up but never made it to record stores as Virgin rejected it. Instead Reid created the more readily available cover designed to look like a easy listening album, in order to deter people from buying it.",
