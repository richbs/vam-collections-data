Jordan\u2019s was one of the main machine-carving firms operating in London from the mid-1840s and was particularly well known because their machines were used to carve decoration for the Palace of Westminster. \n\nJordan's steam-powered cutting tool rotated 3,000 times a minute, passing over the surface of a cast-iron template and also the wood (or stone) that was to be carved, drilling out the shape. Up to eight copies could be made by each machine at once. A carver then finished the surface by hand. \n\nIt is quite possible that details on this sideboard, particularly the two front console lion legs, were roughed out using this process, as similar carvings were advertised by Cox &amp; Son, which bought Jordan's machinery in 1859.",

These work within a groove, the guide being in the centre of the frame, having the pattern piece to be carved immediately underneath it, traversing it in all directions, and whilst doing so the cutters are entirely under its control, and drill away the extraneous wood down to the required line with the greatest precision. Several panels or other examples can thus be worked at the same time, one cutter being employed upon each piece of carving.'
