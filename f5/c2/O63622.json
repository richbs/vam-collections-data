The left arm is hanging from and holds an unidentified object (broken and missing).   A small attendant figure at her feet is now broken and largely missing.    The rectangular pedestal on which she stands is supported on the head and shoulders of a male figure.\n\nApasaras are nymph-like divinities inhabiting the sky or atmosphere, but often visiting the earth.  They have the faculty of changing their shapes at will.  In the early Indian tradition they were especially associated with water; in later tradition with song and dance.  The figure is dressed in the celestial striped diaphanous skirt, earrings, necklace and bracelets.",
