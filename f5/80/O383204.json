Before the development of modern medicine, fevers, cramps and toothache could be painful and dangerous.  Childbirth could kill mother or child.  Many people believed that the supernatural powers embodied in an amulet could promote fertility and good health and offer protection against malign forces or the \u2018evil eye\u2019.  Although the Catholic Church was opposed to the pagan nature of many amulets, it was powerless to prevent their use.  It is unlikely that the wearers were aware of any conflict between their belief in amulets and religious pendants, and pendants of Christian or pagan origin were frequently worn side by side. \n\nA heart could be considered both as an amulet and a Catholic symbol.  This heart probably functioned as a Christian reliquary, as it contains a piece of coloured brocade which probably came from some liturgical cloth.",
