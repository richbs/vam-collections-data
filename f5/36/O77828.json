            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nTrump was the pet dog of the artist William Hogarth (1697-1762), and porcelain figures of the pug were probably intended for sale to admirers of Hogarth's paintings and prints. They would probably have been displayed in libraries or other domestic interiors. Trump has a much longer muzzle than the pugs of today.\n\nPeople\nHogarth depicted Trump prominently in the foreground of his self-portrait of 1745 (now in Tate Britain). A combative personality, Hogarth identified strongly with his pet, and as a result was himself depicted as Trump in Pug's Graces, a caricature of 1753 by the watercolour painter Paul Sandby (1730-1809). The sculptor Louis-Fran\u00e7ois Roubiliac (1705-1762) modelled the original terracotta on which this small sculpture is indirectly based. The manager of the Chelsea porcelain factory, Nicholas Sprimont (1716-1771), was a friend of both Hogarth and Roubiliac.\n\nDesign & Designing\nRoubiliac's original terracotta of Trump remained with Hogarth's widow until her death in 1790, while plaster casts of the pug were sold among the sculptor's effects in 1762. The Staffordshire potter Josiah Wedgwood (1730-1795) made versions in Black Basalt. He based these on a cast bought in 1774 from the London plaster shop of Richard Parker. The Chelsea factory probably also based its version on a commercially available plaster.",

ISBN 1851773088.\nAcquired in 1966 at a time when the Museum was showing a new interest in the mid-eighteenth-century Rococo style, this appealing piece links Nicholas Sprimont's Chelsea porcelain factory to the painter William Hogarth and the sculptor L. F. Roubiliac. An icon of Englishness, the figure combines a popular English animal subject with the names of two major figures in the history of English art.\nThe figure of Hogarth's much-loved pet dog Trump is based on a lost terra cotta by Roubiliac that was originally associated with the sculptor's bust of Hogarth (now in the National Portrait Gallery). Casts and moulds of pugs and dogs are recorded at the sale that followed Roubiliac's death in 1762; some of these must have passed into the hands of Richard Parker, a dealer in plaster casts, who subsequently sold a \"Pug Dog\" to Josiah Wedgwood.\nBy linking Hogarth, Roubiliac, and Sprimont, a silversmith who transferred his skills to porcelain at his Chelsea factory, Trump provides a vivid illustration of the interconnections among a group of artists who congregated at Slaughter's Coffee House and at the St. Martin's Lane Academy in London's Soho district, and who were seen as pioneering the Rococo style in England.\nThe figure of Trump intersects a number of points of scholarship significant to the Museum's collections: archival research on English sculpture (for example, establishing that Sprimont was the godfather of Roubiliac's daughter); interpretation of the decorative arts in terms of a sequence of period styles; a more recent focus on the consumption of luxury objects and its relationship to social history; and a renewed interest in such a piece as evidence of the relationship between the porcelain factories and the London plaster shops. In addition, the discovery of documentation indicating Roubiliac's interest in using Chelsea porcelain in one of his monuments in 1745 has prompted a reappraisal of the relationship between this important sculptor and the equally important Chelsea porcelain factory.\n\nLit.
