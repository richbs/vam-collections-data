The Virgin Mary, bare-headed and wearing a gown and a cloak and shoes, sits on a bench with back and sides on the right-hand side of the panel; with her left hand she holds on her lap an open book, doubtless bearing Isaiah's prophecy. She looks up to the archangel Gabriel, her right hand raised in acknowledgement of his salutation. The winged figure of the angel, wearing a circlet on his head and a robe, stands on a wave-like ledge. He leans forward, looking down at the Virgin, pointing at her with his right hand. A scroll held in his left hand curves up to the top right-hand corner of the panel; on it are traces of the words of the angel's salutation. A vase with three lily flowers stands below.\n\nA break across the panel from top right to bottom left has been repaired. The top of the angel's left wing has been broken off, as has the Virgin's right hand. Traces of green paint and the slightest traces of the usual daisy pattern remain on the ground. The background of the panel is gilt, with traces of applied gesso knobs. There are traces of red on the Virgin's gown; her halo is picked out in red. There are traces of green, now darkened, on the three lily stems. There is black paint on the inner edge of the chamfered frame. The back of the panel is covered by slate.",

Gabriel\u2019s words to Mary were probably painted on the scroll that curls from his left hand: traces of writing can just be made out.\n\nThere are two sorts of alabaster. Calcite alabaster is very hard and was used in ancient times. This object is made of gypsum alabaster which is a fine-grained, soft and smooth stone. Although at first glance it looks a little like marble, which it was intended to imitate, it was much easier to carve due to its softness, and alabaster objects were therefore significantly cheaper to produce. Marble does not originate in England, so it was imported if needed, whereas in the 15th century there were important alabaster quarries in Nottingham, York, Burton-on-Trent and London. England was a major centre for the production of objects such as this one. During period, they were exported in very large numbers to Europe where they survive, unlike many examples which remained in England and were destroyed or greatly damaged during the Reformation.",
