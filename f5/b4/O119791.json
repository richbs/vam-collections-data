It comes from a series of such panels showing birds flanking a vase of flowers and flowering branches. There are other examples from this series in the Museum of London, and the V&A also has one acquired earlier (E.2001-1919). \n\nSuch English-made wallpapers constitute fascinating evidence of the widespread fashion for chinoisierie in European furnishing and decoration in the 18th century, a fashion that was at its height in the third quarter of the 18th century, when genuine Chinese wallpapers were imported in large numbers but remained expensive and highly sought-after. British manufacturers exploited this demand by producing cheaper papers in the Chinese manner. They were cheaper than the Chinese product because they had printed outlines with hand-painted or stencilled colour (unlike the Chinese papers which were usually hand-painted throughout). In this series, the designs are elegant and the artist has made a reasonably convincing attempt to imitate Chinese pictorial conventions and motifs; the designs may have been copied from pattern books of the period or inspired by patterns on lacquer work and textiles as well as Chinese wallpapers themselves. By comparing this panel with others from the series we can see how the designer/manufacturer varied the basic model from one panel to the next.\n\nPapers such as this is in approximately square rectangular formats were probably designed as overmantels or overdoors.",
