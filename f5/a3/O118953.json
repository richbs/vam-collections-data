The tools of craftsmen were often engraved upon seal matrices and rings to indicate membership of the guild and also confer status upon the wearer.\nA large group of rings from Germany and central Europe, most of which are silver or bronze and which bear the emblems of a number of trades can be found in the Koch collection (Chadour, cat nos. 1098-1138). The British Museum holds a fifteenth century bronze French ring bearing a mason's hammer and the inscription Guille Macon (William the mason) (Dalton, cat.419., Ward, cat.168). The closest parallel to the V&A ring is catalogue number 1101 in the Koch collection, a Hungarian silver ring engraved with a pair of open shears on the bezel enclosed within a shield above which are the letters NM. Although the V&A ring was originally believed to be English, the parallels in the Koch collection and British Museum make a European or German origin more likely. The English attribution was partly based upon the inscription being read as <i>grace</i> but this cannot be clearly made out and should be reassessed.",
