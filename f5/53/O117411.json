Less well known is her concern for the role of woman as artist.\n\nIn the 1970s she was teaching at the Slade School of Art. This work commemorates her experience. On her first morning there she was shown up to the life drawing studio, the assumption being that she was a new model; women teachers were unheard of at the time. Here Donagh shows herself in a pose she would assume as a painter but without the support of a marl stick (a tool traditionally used to steady the arm holding the brush). Her fingers appear to magically conjure colour out of a space otherwise occupied by a grid of organisational lines - an unrelenting repetition of squares and right angles. While assuming the pose of a sexually desirable woman, at the same time she asserts her independence through lack of material support (the marl stick). The hair shielding the body evokes a Godiva-like determination to achieve what she has set out to do by sheer ingenuity in the face of all the sexual-political odds.",
