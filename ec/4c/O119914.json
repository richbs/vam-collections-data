The timber chosen is fairly strong but also attractive in colour, and presumably was easily available (and in this quantity inexpensive if not worthless). A small rectangle of wood (the same thickness as the finished winder) would have been sawn out, aligning the grain so that it ran top to bottom (for strength). Drawing the outline of the winder and cutting out the H shape was probably done with knife, small saw and/or chisels, then shaping the edges, again with almost any available blade. At this point it would have been functional. The inscription required care and ingenuity in laying out, and patience in cutting to achieve consistency - but could have been done with a simple pointed blade and did not require specialist skills. As such the inscription is a good example of neat amateur work, personally significant, and historically informative.\n\nPart of the inscription is taken from psalm 25, v. 5, as it appeared in the Prayer book of 1549:\nLead me forth in thy truth and learn me: for thou are the Lord of my salvation; in thee hath been my hope all the day long.",
