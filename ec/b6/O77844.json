Using the passion of the British for their gardens as a metaphor, the designers proposed prototype objects that examined the sense of alienation and frustration that lies beneath the surface of our personal relationships. Many of their solutions were witty and ironic, but the humour barely concealed a darker layer of anxiety. These prototypes are not intended to be mass-manufactured, but are intended to allow reflection on our relationships with objects, with nature and with each other. As such they show an interest in the conceptual content of designed objects that has inspired much innovation amongst contemporary designers.\n\nThe table is called Cucumber Sandwiches and is a device for growing, straightening and displaying cucumbers. The designers contended that because we take pride in our prize-winning vegetables, we need a device to show them off to their best advantage.  Arguably, straight cucumbers enable more efficient sandwich-making.",
