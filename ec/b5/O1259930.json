            "public_access_description": "Photographer J.D. 'Okhai Ojeikere (1930-2014) was born in the village of Ovbiomu-Emai in Southwest Nigeria. He began to document Nigerian culture in 1967 while part of the arts council, which was established following the country\u2019s independence from British colonial rule in 1960. \n\nHis photographs include examples of the elaborate headties traditionally worn by Nigerian women, known as \u2018gele\u2019. The standardised rear view format of Ojeikere\u2019s photographs of gele link them to his larger series of modern and traditional Nigerian hairstyles photographed in the same way. Both series focus on the artistry of the forms created, which Ojeikere referred to as \u2018sculptures for a day\u2019. \n\nGele are traditionally tied at the back using as\u1ecd-oke; a stiff, hand woven cloth which can be manipulated to stand away from the head, creating dramatic shapes. The head wraps originate from the Yoruba people in Southwest Nigeria. They are now largely worn for ceremonial occasions. Yoruba culture places great emphasis on the head and both gele and hairstyling became ways to convey social status. \n\nThe V&amp;A acquired eight photographs by J.D. 'Okhai Ojeikere documenting hairstyles and headties as part of the Staying Power project. Staying Power is a five year partnership between the V&amp;A and Black Cultural Archives. The project aims to explore black British experience from the 1950s to the 1990s through photographs acquired by the V&amp;A and oral histories conducted by Black Cultural Archives.",
