This example was possibly a comparatively inexpensive wedding present.\n\nPeople\nGeneral George Monck (1608-1670) at first supported Charles I, but then fought for Oliver Cromwell during the Civil War. At the end of the Protectorate, he played an important role in the restoration of Charles II and was created Duke of Albemarle. Ten years after his death, he was still a popular hero. A book was published in 1680 by his chaplain, John Price, entitled The Mystery and Method of His Majesty's Happy Restoration and it included an engraved portrait of Monck.\n\nTime\nThe end of Charles II's reign was a period of political unrest. The Whigs supported the succession of Charles's illegitimate son, James, Duke of Monmouth. However, the legitimate heir was Charles's Roman Catholic brother, James. When the House of Lords rejected a bill that would have disbarred James from the throne there was much rioting in London.  At this point, there may well have been nostalgia for the political skills of General Monck.",

Illustrated fig. 36, 185p, together with other similar examples and a possible source, an etching in the British Museum, fig. 35.\n'Indeed the identification of the much-admired Monck as the mounted figure in a group of similarly decorated dishes is based on the dated example of 1680 in the V &amp; A which is initialled GM (published by Archer).  But Julia Poole has queried the identity of the figure in the example in the British Museum (Dawson, Aileen, E<u>nglish and Irish Delftware</u>, 2010, pp 94-95).  She has suggested that the source may be an amalgam of an anonymous etching of the general (fig. 35) and similar portraits of the Duke of Newcastle in <u>La Methode et Invention Nouvelle de Dresser les Chevaux</u> (1657 and 1658), and yet others of Charles II (fig. 39).  In her view this places a question mark over the identification of this rider as  Monck. (Review of Dawson in the Burlington Magazine, November 2010)'",
