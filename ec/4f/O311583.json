The four terracottas were later moved to Jennens' newly built country house, Gopsall, near Leicester and must have stayed there until the contents were sold in 1918 at auction. They were bought by the Reverend E.W.M.O. de la Hey, who showed photographs to Miss Longhurst in 1933. Then sold by Mr de la Hey's grandson in 1955 all four passed to Alfred Spero, from whom Dr. Hildburgh bought the V&A terracottas.",
