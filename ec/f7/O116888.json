The region\u2019s natural gold resources had made the Asante wealthy and court regalia, which included textiles (kente), ivory and gold, reflected high levels of skill and technology. \n\nSwords with wooden pommels decorated with beaten gold have featured in Asante court regalia since the 17th century. Their use appears to be ceremonial; no record exists of their use in warfare, and they lack a cutting edge.\n\nThe Museum\u2019s accessions register records that this sword was \u2018presented to Colonel Edward Sladen by Yaw Boaki, King of Bekwai, Ashanti, in 1901\u2019. It includes an original handwritten letter from Yaw Boaki to \u2018The Officer Commanding\u2019 (dated 2 February 1901) in which he explains that the sword was sent \u2018as a present per the bearers\u2019 in exchange for them being given permission to \u2018reach coast as to purchase me some foods\u2019.\n\nA series of conflicts between the British, who had replaced other Europeans at the coast, and the Asante led an eventual Asante defeat in 1900 and the region\u2019s annexation as part of Britain's Gold Coast colony. Renamed Ghana, the colony became the first independent post-colonial African state in 1957.",
