New types of object, such as this sugar basin for dessert, were increasingly modelled on silverware, with heavily moulded edges and sturdy handles that admirably suited the rich taste of the 1830s.\n\nCollectors & Owners\nThis sugar basin is part of a service that was acquired by the V&A from Miss H. M. Gulson, who had inherited it from her uncle, Josiah Spode IV (1823-1893). Although the Museum wished to accept only a token number of pieces, because of the impossibility of displaying the service in its entirety, eventually they agreed to take it all, rather than destroy the integrity of a documented service. Since 1902 it has largely remained in store, although parts of the service have in recent years been loaned to 10 Downing Street. The British Galleries now provide a fitting permanent display of the many different shapes used in the service.\n\nThe Spode family provenance suggests that the service should represent the grandest and most opulent porcelain made at the factory at Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, in the last years of Spode ownership. The factory archives, now available to collectors, show that the moulded shape called 'Royal Embossed' was first made about 1831. This date exactly agrees with the introduction of the painted pattern (No.4964). It would seem therefore that Josiah Spode IV, only eight years old in 1831, may have inherited the service later from his own father, Josiah Spode III.",

Although the V&A wished to accept  only a token number of pieces because of the impossibility of displaying the service in its  entirety, eventually it agreed to take all of them rather than destroy the integrity of a  documentary service.\n\nThe family provenance suggests that the service represents the grandest and most opulent  porcelain made at the factory at Stoke-on-Trent in the last years of the Spode family's  ownership. The factory archives reveal that the moulded shape 'Royal Embossed' was first  made about 1831, a date that exactly agrees with the introduction of this service's painted  pattern (no. 4964). It would seem, therefore, that Josiah Spode IV, who was only eight years  old in 1831, may have inherited it at a later date from his father, Josiah Spode III. According to a letter from Miss Gulson in 1902, the dessert services in the gift were made for the marriage of Josiah Spode III and his wife Mary Williamson.",
