It is a reflection of the modern world, using the totally new theme of aircraft, (incidentally, a monoplane which was the latest in airframe technology.) The idea of putting industrial inventions on wallpaper was not new, as railway engines had appeared on popular wallpapers in the middle of the 19th century, although they were much despised by the design establishment of the time. McGrath's pattern is skillfully worked out and is strangely prophetic of the m\u00eal\u00e9e of fast monoplanes battling in and out of the clouds that was soon to come in the Second World War.",

It is a reflection of the modern world, using the totally new theme of aircraft, (incidentally, a monoplane which was the latest in airframe technology.) The idea of putting industrial inventions on wallpaper was not new, as railway engines had appeared on popular wallpapers in the middle of the 19th century, although they were much despised by the design establishment of the time. McGrath's pattern is skillfully worked out and is strangely prophetic of the m\u00eal\u00e9e of fast monoplanes battling in and out of the clouds that was soon to come.\n\n[Charles Newton, 'British Design at Home', p.124]",
