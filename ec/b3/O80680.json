Pupil of the portraitist in crayons and engraver John Raphael Smith 1802-6; entered RA Schools 1807. Exhibited 13 landscapes and topographical views at the RA between 1807 and 1828 and 11 at the BI 1808-24, but principally watercolours - 417 at the OWS 1808-49. Also worked for engravers of topographical books. Married the sister of his friend William Hilton RA. Lived many years in Lincoln, where the Usher Art Gallery has a fine collection of his work. Many watercolours and drawings also in the V&A collections. Died London 30 June 1849; his studio sale was at Christie's 22-28 May 1850. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal 1849</i>, p260 (obit); W Armstrong <i>Memoir of Peter De Wint</i> 1888; H De Wint A Short Memoir ... privately printed c1900, reprinted in <i>Smith</i>; H Smith <i>Peter De Wint</i> 1982 (and for fuller bibliography) \n\n<b>Landscape with Lightning and a Hermit</b> \n259-1872 Neg FF330 \nCanvas, 74.3 x 104.1 cm (29\u00bc x 41 ins) \nGiven by Mrs P Tatlock (the artist's daughter) 1872\n \nThe work does not seem to have been exhibited. Dated by Smith to between 1812 and 1816, and, as he comments, a most uncharacteristic work, based principally on the compositions of Salvator Rosa (many of whose works were shown in old master exhibitions at the BI between 1816 and 1824) and Gaspar Dughet (see for example his 'Storm' purchased by NG in 1824). Smith comments that it 'might be described as a parody of the picturesque', and rightly draws attention to the possible influence of Richard Wilson's (uncharacteristically dramatic) 'Destruction of Ni obe's Children' (then in Sir George Beaumont's collection and exhibited at the BI in 1814; later NG and Tate Gallery, since destroyed; but see the 1760 version now in the Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, USA). \n\nEXH: <i>Peter de Wint</i> Agnew 1966 (64) \n\nLIT: <i>Smith</i> pp61, 69, repr pl 66; H.
