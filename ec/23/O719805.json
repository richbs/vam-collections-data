Herbert, R.A. at 1 Gloucester Road.\n\nThe table is the likely subject of several letters between Pugin and Crace during the period March to September 1850. In one dated April of that year, Pugin discusses the design of a dining table which may be for Herbert saying that 'it can hardly bee too plain'.\n\nAugustus Welby Northmore Pugin (1812-52) is widely considered as one of the most significant and influential architects, designers and theorists of the 19th century. Following his conversion to Catholicism in 1835, he identified the Gothic style with Christian architecture and his work and writings inspired and framed the Gothic Revival. In 'Contrasts', published in 1836, he condemned classical forms and ardently praised 14th and 15th-century architecture. Pugin is best remembered for his work on the Palace of Westminster.",
