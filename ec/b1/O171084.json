Made in Kyoto by the 4th generation head of the Dohachi workshop, it would have appealed to the widespread interest in classical Chinese culture that prevailed in Japan during the nineteenth century. The flower pot was part of a group of over 200 ceramics bought on behalf of the V&A by the Japanese Exposition commissioners with funds provided by Philip Cunliffe-Owen, an ardent Japanophile who was director of the V&A from 1874 to 1893. The instructions sent to the commissioners were that they should 'make an historical collection of porcelain and pottery from the earliest period until the present time, to be formed in such a way as to give fully the history of the art.'",
