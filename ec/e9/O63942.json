R.Lewis, Sir William Russell Flint 1880-1969, 1980.\n\nWhen studying at Heatherley's drawing school, Flint practised painting in monochrome, to further his ambition to become a magazine illustrator. Monochrome drawings were the starting point of the cheaper and much more common form of  half-tone illustrations at the beginning of the 20th century, as opposed to expensive and difficult full colour half-tone reproduction. See R.Lewis, Sir William Russell Flint 1880-1969, 1980. p.22",
