It was known as a 'fuddling cup', meaning that it would confuse or stupefy the user, even though the three interlinked cups would hardly contain enough ale to induce drunkenness.\n\nDesign & Designing\nDeltfware is a tin-glazed earthenware. Since the soft earthenware has to be quite thick, and the glaze has to be applied liberally, this small object has a rather coarse appearance. The painted symbols, freely borrowed from Chinese porcelain, are at odds with its lumpish form.\n\nOwnership & Use\nTrick beer vessels are usually associated with taverns. However, the fact that this piece has survived in remarkable condition suggests that it was either very seldom used, or else kept at home as a display object.",
