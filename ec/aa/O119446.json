This represents the young Queen Victoria (1819-1901) and the earliest datable Staffordshire figures appear to be those of the Queen herself, who was crowned in 1837.  Images of royalty proved a lucrative market and during the 1840s there were countless other royal figures issued by Staffordshire pottery firms, celebrating for example Victoria's marriage to Prince Albert in 1840, and the birth of the royal children. A figurine of Prince Albert was produced as a pair to this.\n\nAlthough a few Staffordshire portrait figures were produced after Victoria's death in 1901, few appear to have been produced after 1905.  During their heyday however they were produced in vast numbers, usually modelled after prints. As well as the royal family they represented a wide variety of subjects, those of actors and actresses being especially popular.",
