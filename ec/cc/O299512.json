Tribal peoples, such as the Bedouin, usually wore stiff circular or penannular bracelets, rather than the flexible and hinged bracelets which were more common among urban women.  \n\nBracelets like this, with flaring ends, are typical of North Africa from the Maghreb to Egypt.  This example comes from the oases of the desert between Egypt and Libya, as is shown by the three fluted bosses, riveted to the band.  It was acquired in Cairo, with its pair, before 1869 and is clearly marked with the silver marks current in Egypt in the 19th century.  Their name was recorded as asawir, which is a generic Arabic name for bracelets.",
