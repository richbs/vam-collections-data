            "public_access_description": "As told in Matthew 2, after the birth of Christ, the Magi came from the East, following a star, to seek the king of the Jews. The eldest king, Caspar, kneels at the Child's feet, his gold offering visible on the step in the foreground, behind him, Melchior and Balthazar proffer their offerings of frankincense and myrrh.  This unusual painting combines a traditional representation of the Adoration of the Magi in the style of the Flemish painter Gerard David (c. 1460-1523) of ca. 1500.  The figure of Saint Margaret however evokes representations of the Saint by the so-called 'Master of the Legend of Saint Magdalen.' In contrast, the landscape is in the tradition of late sixteenth-century Netherlandish paintings while the small background figures who swagger about in early 17th century 'Cavalier' dress recall works by the Flemish painter Sebastiaen Vrancx (1573-1647).  This combination of elements suggests that the work may be a pastiche with the various parts painted by different artists; the landscape may be a later addition.",

London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, p. 205, cat. no. 254\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\nNetherlandish School, 16th century \n\n254 \nTHE ADORATION OF THE MAGI WITH ST MARGARET AND A NUN \nOak panel 26 X 21 (66 X 53.3) \n533-1870\n\nCatalogued as by Heemskerck in the Weyer sale at Cologne in 1862, the attribution was changed to Flemish school in the 1893 <i>Catalogue</i> (p. 190). The style of the figures is comparable to that of Netherlandish artists of the first decade of the 16th century, such as Jan Joest (Kalkar altar-piece, 1505-08, M. J. Friedlander, <i>Die Altniederl\u00e4dndische Malerei</i>, ix, no. I), but the free treatment of the landscape background suggests a slightly later period, c. 1520-30. As to the costume, the somewhat exotic hats of the figures in the background occur most frequently in the second and third decades of the century and this date would also fit the mixture of the late gothic silver and the Renaissance decoration on the capitals. \nSt Margaret is shown with all her attributes: the dragon, the cross with which she pierced the dragon when it was set upon her, the crown of pearls ('marguerites') and the dove. All these except the dove are commonly depicted with the Saint; the dove appears more rarely, for example in the 15th century <i>Virgin and Child with saints</i> in the Weld Blundell Collection (exh. <i>Flemish art</i>, R. A., 1953, no. 71). \n\nCondition. Cleaned in 1959, when small areas of damage in the sky and on the nun's habit were retouched.\nProv. J.P. Weyer, Cologne; Weyer sale, Heberle & Lempertz, Cologne, 25 Aug. 1862, lot 198; John Parsons; bequeathed to the Museum in 1870.",
