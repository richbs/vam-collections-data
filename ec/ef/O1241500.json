He came to Britain in 1845 from his native Novy Bor, in Northern Bohemia as an economic migrant. He became naturalised British in 1853 and married Sarah Holland three years later.\nThis small wine-goblet with exceptionally fine engraving was donated by Miss Muriel Oppitz, a great-granddaughter of Paul and Sarah. It was part of a number of glasses kept in the family made by his great-grandfather. These were probably mostly used as examples for clients commissioning engraved glasses from Oppitz.",

This goblet is mentioned on p. 65 as en-suite with a large covered cup acquired by the Toledo Museum of Art in 2004 (plates 2-3). Smith follows family tradition in assuming that Paul Oppitz brought this covered goblet and the small en-suite goblet over to England when he moved from his native Bohemian in 1845. Stylistically, both glasses should probably be dated a little later.",
