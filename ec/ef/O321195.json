This object was probably made in Cairo between 1450 and 1520 A.D. The doors were bought by the French Count Gaston Saint Maurice. The Count probably used the doors as a decorative fitting within his Neo-Mamluk home in the centre of Cairo.

            "history_note": "This pair of doors was originally designed and made in the fifteenth century. The doors would have originally formed part of the minbar (pulpit within a mosque). The wood and ivory plaques were probably made towards the end of Burgi Mamluk rule (1382 to 1517 A.D), between 1480 and 1520. Mamluk minbars in Cairo were decorated with individually carved ivory and wood inlay plaques, which were set into complex geometric patterns. \n\nThis set of doors was owned by Count Charles Gaston Esmangard de Bournonville de Saint Maurice (1831-1905). The Count lived in Cairo between 1868 and 1883 where he worked as the Grand Equerry for the Khedive. He was a major collector of Islamic Art in Cairo. The Count collected many Islamic objects from the city of Cairo which he used to furnish his home in Cairo. The French architect Ambroise Baudry designed the Count's home in the Neo-Mamluk style. Situated in the modern city centre of Ismailiya on the east bank of the Nile, this Neo- Mamluk building blended Islamic Egyptian architectural motifs into a modern home fit for a member of the Khedival administration. These minbar doors would have been used to furnish the interior of the house; the decorative minbar doors were an integral part of the Neo- Mamluk interior. \n\n This panel formed part of what would be later known as the Saint Maurice collection \u2013 which was comprised of Middle Eastern objects such as bronze and ivory doors, Persian and Egyptian tiles, mashrabiya windows, clothes, jewellery and a collection of plaster casts.  This item was accessioned in 1884; this panel had previously been on display at the 1878 Exposition Universelle and then at the Musee des Arts Decoratifs, Paris. The Musee des Arts Decoratifs purchased nineteen inlaid minbar panels from the Saint Maurice collection. The Victoria and Albert Museum's collection of Mamluk minbar panels is comrised of objects from the Saint Maurice collection and the Meymar collection (accessioned in 1867).\n\n\n\n[Door] This pair of doors was originally designed and made in the fifteenth century. The doors would have originally formed part of the minbar (pulpit within a mosque).

The Count collected many Islamic objects from the city of Cairo which he used to furnish his home in Cairo. The Count\u2019s home in Cairo was designed by the French architects Charles Guimbard and Marcel Gouron- Boisvert and built in 1872 in the Neo-Mamluk style. The Neo-Mamluk style was formed from Mamluk architectural motifs such as brown and white striped facades and reclaimed mashrabiya windows (turned wood projecting windows). Gaston Saint Maurice\u2019s home was a key example of this style and was situated in the newly developed Qasr El- Nil in the modern city centre of Ismailiya the area of Cairo located opposite Gezira island on the east bank of the Nile. These pulpit doors would have been used to furnish the interior of the house. \n\nIn 1878 the Count ran into financial difficulties and put both his Cairo home and its contents up for sale. This panel formed part of what would be later known as the Saint Maurice collection \u2013 which was comprised of Middle Eastern objects such as bronze and ivory doors, Persian and Egyptian tiles, mashrabiya windows, wooden inscriptions, clothes and jewellery and a collection of plaster casts. This collection was exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1878. After being placed on display at the 1878 Exposition Universelle, the collection of 200 objects was then lent to the Musee des Arts Decoratifs in Paris, from where the South Kensington Museum (V&A) made a large number of purchases to enhance their growing collection of Islamic art. The Musee des Arts Decoratifs also purchased nineteen inlaid panels. Together with the Meymar collection (accessioned in 1867), the Saint Maurice collection expanded the collection of \u2018Saracenic\u2019 art \u2013 or the art of the Mamluks (who ruled Egypt and Syria 1250-1517) \u2013 in this museum.",
