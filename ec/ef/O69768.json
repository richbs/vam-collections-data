However the artist has edited this image only to the dominant features, the Englishman, gun and tiger. The painter depicted the animal with a tiger's ring marked tail but missed out the tiger's stripes on its body, instead the animal has almost a leopard's spots.\n\nHistorical significance: Calcutta was recognised as the capital of British India from 1833-1912. By the 1830s, artists (patuas) had arrived from rural villages in Bengal and began to produce paintings that reflected the local history, mythology, customs and conflics of a colonised society. As a popular art form, these artists are recognised for their use of brilliant colour, simplified images and swift and bold brushstrokes that became the hallmark of Kalighat painting in the 19th and early 20th century.",
