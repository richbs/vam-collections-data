A triumphal column depicting his victories was erected in Rome, a full size replica of which can be found in the Museum's Cast Courts. \n\nThe Paris goldsmith Gabriel-Raoul Morel was noted for the range of media in which he worked. He is known to have used panels identical to this in a box with differently chased mounts. An inscription inside this box records that it was given to Sir Walter Farquhar by Count Woronzov. Farquhar was a army and naval surgeon who later became physician to the Prince of Wales, the future George IV.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world\u2019s great decorative art collections, including silver,  mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
