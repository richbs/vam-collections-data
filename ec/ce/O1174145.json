In his staging Salome's death was not shown - she was killed below the stage in John the Baptist's prison. In 1977 the production was revived under the direction of Charles Hamilton, who wanted Salome to die on stage, crushed between the soldiers' shields, as in the original stage directions.  The problems of staging this scene were solved by the Royal Opera House Armourer, Terry Keen, who devised two huge spiked shields in the 1970s 'new brutalism' style, with retractable spikes and cones of leather containing concealed springs. At the back of each shield was fixed a blood bag which burst when Salome was crushed so that blood flowed through small holes in the back of the shield. Associated production: Salome. Designer: Andrzej Majewski. Armourer: Terry Keen. Director: Charles Hamilton. Performing company: Royal Opera. 3.11.1977. Andrzej Majewski designed the production.",
