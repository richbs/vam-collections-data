            "public_access_description": "This earthenware figure represents a richly dressed man, possibly a senior official or a courtier acting as a tomb guardian, and was placed in the tomb of a wealthy person. During the Tang dynasty (AD 618-906) Chinese graves were decorated with murals depicting scenes from court life, performances, or hunting activities, and were also enriched by a large variety of painted or glazed figures that were meant to assist or protect the deceased in the afterlife. \n\nIn this example, the figure was built using coils of clay which can still be seen inside, and smoothing the outside with a tool. The whole body was painted with a white colour, and then a layer of pale pink was added to the flesh portions. The brocade design of clouds and floral scrolls on the silk robe was painted in pink, black, red and green with traces of gilding along the edges. About 60% of the original pigments is still visible on the surface.\n\nThe hairstyle and clothing of grave figures provide a fascinating insight into the fashion and taste of the time. In this example, the robe is characterised by a cape with a high collar and a V-shaped opening at the neck, long sleeves and frilled ends, from which the shoes emerge with their long, upturned toes.",
