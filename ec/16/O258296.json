The design shows a stylised griffin with floral decoration surrounding it, within a roundel. The roundel border is of continuous vines. Only a third of this remains. To one side of this roundel is the edge of an octagonal roundel with a floral pattern (?) in the centre. Only some of this remains.  The edge of another circular roundel can be seen and between these are floral designs. The fabric is stained and there are some red marks upon it.\n\nSamite (twill woven silk) was thought to originate from Persia under Sassanian rule (AD224-651). It was commonly decorated with pairs of animals and birds and set in pearled lotus roundels. It is often found in Western burials, within church possessions and along the Silk Road. Byzantine weaving workshops took on the samite technique to make it an essential weave of the period.  It was a luxury textile of the Middle Ages brought to Europe when the Crusades opened up direct contact with the East. It was forbidden to the middle classes of France under the sumptuary rules c. 1470.",
