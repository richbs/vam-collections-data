Lady Hawarden herself had studied in Rome. Emulation of the Old Masters was also to inspire Julia Margaret Cameron, who began photographing in 1864.

Inscription (verso): No. 212; Inscription (verso of mount): (X614-)212 229 x 218 mm  PH 377-1947 Literature:  Microfilm: 3.18.139  Towards a Bigger Picture, Victoria and Albert Museum, 1987. Clementina appears to have been her mother's favourite model. She was very gifted, capable of a range of expressions and gestures, and she was superbly photogenic. For Lady Hawarden's camera she played the parts of saints and sinners, men and women, modern and antique. She was Lady Hawarden's Magdalen, as seen in photographs Ph 457-1968:440 (D.438) and Ph 457\u00ad1968:410 (D.440). In this photograph she is possibly meant to be the Madonna, in an attitude and costume borrowed from the Old Masters.'",
