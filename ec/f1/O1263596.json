Her store, Bazaar, opened in 1955 in London and quickly became popular for the \u2018Chelsea set\u2019, which was a group of young artists, film directors and socialites. It became a focal point for 1960\u2019s young adult fashion because it provided a place for young people, who no longer wanted to dress like their parents, to purchase clothing that matched their urban lifestyle. Innovative designs featuring fun colourful clothing, like skinny-rib sweaters and pinafore dresses, were catered for customers\u2019 demands. Mini-skirts and the mini-dresses with coloured tights were the most appealing for the female consumer.",
