They don\u2019t advertise at all, and people learn of their products only by word of mouth. Their flagship shop, in Saint-Germain, is very discreet: there is no sign, so one could easily miss it altogether. Their packaging is entirely in keeping with the above \u2013 restrained, but enigmatic. The colour scheme is always the same \u2013 black and red, a striking combination that recalls French book covers. With this approach, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle appear to suggest that theirs is an erudite profession, akin to connoisseurship.",
