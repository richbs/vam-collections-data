Like his contemporary Bishop Lancelot Andrewes, he regarded the Anglican church as a purified form of traditional Catholicism. Together they set out to restore the ceremonial that had been abolished with the Reformation of the previous century, including the high altar and the use of candles and incense.\n\nLaud\u2019s intentions, however, were seen by Parliament as an attempt to overthrow the Protestant religion and in 1645 he was beheaded. It was not until the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 that churches could again use a Gothic chalice and celebrate the Eucharist with an elaborately chased and decorated communion set.",
