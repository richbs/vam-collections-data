These bowls were not only sought after in China, but also in Japan, This type of ware is often referred to as 'Jian ware' after their place of production in Fujian province or 'Temmoku', the latter being a Japanese term.\n\nSouthern black ware glazes were very sensitive to the effects of glaze application, kiln temperature and the amount of oxygen present in the atmosphere during firing. A wide variety of different effects were created using black glaze of essentially the same composition.\n\nBowls with streaked 'Hare's fur' glazes are the most common types of Jian ware. This bowl exhibits a different kind of glaze known as 'Oil spot'. This effect was achieved when the kiln temperature began to fall quickly while the glaze was still boiling; this fixed the iron rich spots before they could run into streaks.\n\nOil spot bowls from the Jian kilns are rare and much sought after. However, this decorative effect was copied in Northern China using an iron rich slip beneath the glaze in the Song and Jin dynasties. Jian black wares are still made in Fujian today.",
