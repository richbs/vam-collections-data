Its large-scale illustrations represent exotic plants in a melodramatic way. They are shown in landscapes that were supposed to represent their native habitats. Robert Thornton describes \u2018the maggot-bearing STAPELIA [Stapelia hirsuta]\u2019 in his introductory 'Explanation of the Picturesque plates'. He writes that it is shown with \u2018a green African snake, and a blow-fly in the act of depositing her eggs in the flower, with the maggots produced from this cause\u2019. Unfortunately, Thornton employed few artists who were professional botanical illustrators. The ignorance of both author and artist led to many inaccuracies. Here the Maggot-bearing Stapelia is shown in a mountainous northern forest. In fact, stapeliads are found only in southern Africa.\n\nThornton published his great work in parts between 1799 and 1807. At this time there were many competing publications. He failed to sell sufficient copies, and he eventually went bankrupt from the costs of producing the plates.",
