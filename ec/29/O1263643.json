The earliest puppet play featuring the Italian cousin of Mr. Punch was recorded by Samuel Pepys in Covent Garden in May 1662. The 17th century Punch was part of a marionette show, but by the 19th century was performed by one man in a canvas-sided booth which was transportable.\n\nParian ware is a type of buisque porcelain developed in the 19th century to imitate items such as busts, figurines and jugs that may once have been carved by marble. Its liquid form meant that it could be poured into moulds, making it an excellent tool of mass production.",
