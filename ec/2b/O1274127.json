She made this sake drinking set under the expert guidance of Clive Burr in his workshop at the Goldsmiths\u2019 Centre, Clerkenwell, London.\n\nKyosun Jung (b.1984) studied jewellery design at the Jangan College, Seoul, South Korea, from 2003 until 2006 gaining a BA with first class honours is currently studying for a BA Honours in Silversmithing, Goldsmithing and Jewellery at the University of the Creative Arts, Rochester, UK.  her personal statement is as follows:\n\n\"I draw inspiration from nature and organic forms, its infinite creations and textures.  I am always looking for new materials and inspirational challenges.  Exploring new technologies in craft and manufacturing is also essential to the process, along with my desire to challenge conventions and perceptions.  The resulting pieces can be admired for their beauty and also for their intended purpose.\n\nMy designs so far have received several awards from the industry, most notably, the Young Designer Silversmith Award of the year, 2013.  The Goldsmiths' Company chose my design of a sake vessel with stacking cups.  The journey to become a professional silversmith has been inspirational.\"",
