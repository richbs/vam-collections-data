It is printed in white and silver, matching the bride's dramatic silver PVC and white gabardine coat and mini-dress ensemble by John Bates. (see T.261:1&2-2009)\n\nMarit Allen (1941-2007) was a leading British fashion journalist who started as an assistant at Queen magazine in 1961. In 1964, she joined British Vogue, where she stayed for ten years. Her 'Young Idea' pages were hugely influential. Many young and innovative designers, such as Bates, received their first significant exposure through Allen, who not only gave them magazine coverage, but happily wore their clothes herself.",
