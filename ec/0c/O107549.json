He wrote about his journey in The British Journal of Photography, outlining his route and in some cases describing the scenes of which he took photographs. \n\nBourne did not mention this particular scene of a stream with a footbridge. However, like many others it reflects his fascinations with the dramatic landscape of the mountainous region, its peaks, valleys and rivers. He captured the images on glass negatives which were then printed in his studio in Simla and offered for sale.",
