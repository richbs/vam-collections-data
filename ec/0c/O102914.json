Even without the sonnet and the dedication 'ALL'IMPAREGGIABILE SIGNORA / SANTINA ZANUZZI' ('To the incomparable Signora Zanuzzi'), the elaborate design of the print would suggest a very popular performer.   \nIn the background, characters from the commedia dell'arte mix with ordinary townspeople. This may mean that Zanuzzi was a performer in Carlo Goldoni's revolutionary plays.  In a  commedia dell\u2019arte (literally \u2018artistic comedy\u2019) company, each actor developed a specific type of character and comic business, such as a swaggering Captain, old men like Pantaloon or the Doctor, a servant and young lovers; the performance was then improvised around these stock characters and a pre-agreed plot.  Instead of the commedia dell'arte's entertainments based on improvisition and stock characters, Goldoni wrote plays based on character and realistic observation of contemporary life.",

As the collection grew, it was displayed in the bar of the Mercury Theatre, the headquarters of Ballet Rambert, but in 1968, Rambert gave the collection to the Victoria and Albert Museum; seven duplicates were returned to Rambert, but these are catalogued in Ivor Guest\u2019s A Gallery of Romantic Ballet, which was published before the collection came to the V&A.  Although often referred to as a collection of Romantic Ballet prints, there are also important engravings of 17th and 18th century performers, as well as lithographs from the later 19th century, by which time the great days of the ballet in London and Paris were over.",

This may mean that Zanuzzi was part of  Carlo Goldoni's revolution in Italian theatre.  Goldoni's plays, based on character and realistic observation of contemporary life, gradually replaced the commedia dell'arte's entertainments based on improvisition and stock characters.",
