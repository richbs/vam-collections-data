While awaiting the arrival of the Buddha of the Future, a bodhisattva postpones his own entry into Nirvana in order to help others achieve enlightenment. \n\nJizo is one of Japan\u2019s most popular bodhisattvas and appears in the guise of a monk carrying a staff in his right hand and the Buddhist wish-fulfilling jewel in his left: both are missing from this sculpture. In early examples he holds a wish-fulfilling gem in his left hand while his right hand indicates the wish-granting mudra.\n\nThe head of this sculpture dates to the late Heian period (12th century). Inscriptions found inside the sculpture indicate that the body may have been restored (or carved to match the head) in 1682 (Tenna 2) by Iori Sadakiyo; at this time the sculpture was housed in Byodoji, a temple in Imayama Village. An inscription on the bottom of the pedestal indicates that this was made later than the restoration in 1755 (Horeki 5). \n\nImages of Jizo are very common in Japan, reflecting the continuing popularity of his worship among the general populace. Because of his mission to save all sentient beings, there evolved the idea of  'six Jizo' - one responsible for each of the six realms of transmigratory existence. The six realms constitute the life cycle of unenlightened mortals: they are Hell, Hunger, Animality, Anger, Humanity and Heaven. \n\nThe denizens of hell were considered especially deserving of Jizo\u2019s help, and he has come to be particularly revered as their saviour. Jizo is also regarded as the protector of children and travellers, hence the number of stone figures of Jizo that can be seen along the roadside in Japan.",
