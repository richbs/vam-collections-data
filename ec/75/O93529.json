To do this she selected a wide aperture, which produced both a short exposure time and a shallow depth of field. Thus, the other sides of the London square onto which the balcony looked are all out of focus. This concentrates our attention on the little comedy enacted on the balcony. The eldest of the girls formally greets the puppy, while the youngest child looks gravely at the camera clutching an owl, the emblem of wisdom.",

Lady Hawarden often used the terrace of the 5 Princes Garden] house as a background for her indoor scenes. Moving outdoors however, she capitalized on the broad, flat expanse of the terrace--actually a roof--and used it as a stage. Using a , large format camera and a lens with limited depth of field, I Lady Hawarden has here transformed the houses and trees , glimpsed over her daughters' shoulders into a soft-focus, grel backdrop. Before this the girls are grouped in a pyramidal , composition and linked as in a conversation piece, I communicating with each other by touch and with the spectator, through the little girl's gaze. Unfortunately, perhaps we ha~ lost the key to this slightly mysterious scene. Isabella .J Grace, well-groomed as always but not too fastidious to put the dog on her lap, and Elphinstone Agnes, as solemn as the bronze owl she hugs, form a solid base. Between them rises Clementina, almost disguised behind her tilted hat, lifted hand and all-embracing cloak. Her theatrical gestures seem to I gently mock her sisters' deportment. With one hand she grasps the dog's paw, much as she clasps her sisters' hands in other photographs. With the other hand she perhaps suppresses a giggle'",
