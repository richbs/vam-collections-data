            "history_note": "In imperial China the most prized material for chairs was the huali wood. Bamboo,  although it was cheaper due to abundant availability, was not necessarily an inferior  alternative to huali wood. The bamboo had for centuries been considered a 'noble'  plant because it stands upright, making it particularly popular amongst the literati.    \n\tTo the European consumers a bamboo chair probably represented something from the  mysterious East. In terms of design the openwork panels on this chair are rather  fanciful and do not accord with traditional Chinese taste, suggesting that the object  was intended for the export market.\n\n\tSoft upholstery such as that found on European chairs was unknown in China before  1800. There were only two types of chair seats in imperial China: a hard seat and a soft  cane seat. A hard seat is usually made of wood, with or without a woven cane matting  on top (for one with cane matting on top see FE.66-1983). \n\n\tA soft seat is made of woven caning, with split bamboo and rattan being the most  commonly used materials. On wooden chairs the cane is woven through holes drilled on  the four sides of the seat frame. As the soft cane seat has to take the weight of the  chair-user it is usally reinforced with a palm-fibre rope underwebbing, also woven  through the same holes. A chair with a soft cane seat would be more comfortable to sit  on, but is not as durable as one with a hard seat. \n\n\tThe wrap-around method of construction is a distinctive characteristic feature of  Chinese bamboo furniture. Because the bamboo stem is hollow it is possible to cut  away part of the fibre where required, leaving the rind to continue as one long  unbroken strip thus eliminating the need for jointing. Apart from its cheapness as a  material the other advantage of the bamboo is its light weight and cool surface.\n\n\tCaning started in China at least a thousand years before chairs were invented, when  the Chinese people sat on mats on the floor. On chairs the hard seat was the norm  except on folding chairs, whose seats are inevitably made of pliable materials. Wooden  chairs with soft cane seats were popular in the 16th and 17th centuries. For bamboo  chairs, if the base of its seat is made of wooden slats as is the case here, the cane  matting on top would be visually more attractive whilst the slats would take the weight  of the chair-user. Bamboo and rattan are both grown in the southern provinces so it is  reasonable to deduce that cane mattings were mostly made in southern China. There is  little information available about how labour was organized.",
