            "public_access_description": "This box forms part of the group of snuffboxes associated with Frederick II, the Great of Prussia. He was a cultivated admirer of the arts. He maintained a lengthy, although sometimes heated correspondence with the French philosopher Voltaire and was a gifted musician, composer and linguist. He had a passion for gold boxes, and took a keen interest in their design.  He carried a box at all times, one is even said to have saved his life by deflecting a bullet during the battle of Kunersdorf in 1759. \n\nThis box is remarkable for its inscription, allowing it to be associated with certainty with Frederick the Great. Around the bezel, we read:\n\"Friedrich der Grosse besass mich. Friedrich Wilhelm III ubergab mich/seinem Sohne Albrecht zum Fideikommis in seiner Familie.\" Translated it states: \"I belonged to Frederick the Great. Frederick William III gave me to his son Albrecht as the inalienable property of his family.\"\n\nThe base is decorated with a scene in coloured hardstones based on the painting Cygne et barbet by Jean-Baptiste Oudry. First exhibited at the Salon of 1740, it rapidly gained popularity and was copied in a number of media, including by S\u00e8vres for a porcelain cuvette, on japanned boxes and in the decoration of the dining room of the Comte de Combert.  On the Gilbert box the artist has substituted a colourful mallard for the swan in order to be able to use a range of different hardstones.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver,  mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
