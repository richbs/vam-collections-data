The shapes of the farm buildings, animals and birds have been cut from coloured felt and sewn together at the edges with very fine, almost invisible stitches. Detail and texture, such as the climbing plant on the wall of the farm house, the thatched roof of the barn, the mane and dappled coat of the horses are worked in silk thread in simple stitches. The border, which may not be original to the picture, is decorated with appliqu\u00e9d foliate scrollwork, outlined in chain stitch.\n\nImages of country life were very popular in mid-nineteenth century Britain, reflecting a pervasive nostalgia for the past and widespread concerns about the threat posed to rural society and the countryside by the scale, speed and spread of industrialisation.\n\nIt is possible that the panel may once have formed part of a counterpane made by John Brayshaw of Lancaster exhibited at the Great Exhibition in 1851.",

The counterpane was included in the exhibition catalogue in class XIX, and listed as no. 382. It was described as \u2018a Counterpane of Mosaic needlework in forty-four compartments, each representing a popular print, twelve feet long by ten feet wide, worked in coloured pieces of cloth without colouring matter, with scroll border of new design\u2019. A corner of the counterpane is reproduced in <i>The Illustrated Exhibitor</i> (London, 1851, p. 391). Four scenes of domestic life worked in rectangles with canted corners are framed by interlocking lines which form links enclosing stylised floral motifs. The counterpane is finished with a broad border of scrolling foliage enclosed within narrow strips of cloth, with a bold foliate rosette in each corner. The scenes depicted in <i>The Illustrated Exhibitor</i> do not include this farmyard scene but differences in the techniques used to create the panel and its border support Rose\u2019s suggestion that the picture may have been taken from a larger textile. The source of the farmyard scene has not been identified.",
