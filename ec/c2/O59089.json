Accessorised with jewels, these gowns provided a glittering show at receptions and balls, the opera or the theatre.  \n\nThis evening dress from around 1950, designed by the London couturier Hardy Amies (1909\u20132003), is made of crimson silk satin and looks very sumptuous.  However, the shape of the dress is created by a lining of thick paper-like material called Vilene, instead of the layers of tulle and silk net petticoats traditionally used by French couturiers.  Textile rationing had only just been lifted in Britain (1949) and fabric was still very scarce, so Vilene was used as an economical alternative.",
