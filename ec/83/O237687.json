He first began dressing in this style in 1980, and it is a look he intended to retain - 'it is rooting'.\n\nAccording to Mr. Stubbings, gay men favoured Levis jeans for their cut and fit. He distressed these jeans using a pumice stone to emphasise the contours of the body beneath. The leather waistcoat was originally linked to the Fetish scene, but moved into mainstream dress. In the mid 1990s, when this outfit was acquired, some lesbians had also claimed this style of dressing for themselves.",

            "history_note": "Part of an outfit (T.591 to 596-1994) that was worn by Justin Stubbings. He started wearing this specific style of dress in about 1980 and expressed his intent of continuing to retain this style of dressing. This outfit was displayed in the V&A's Street Style exhibition of 1994-95 to represent Gay Style.\n\nAccording to Mr. Stubbings, gay men favoured Levis jeans for their cut and fit. The donor distressed these jeans with a pumice stone to emphasis the contours of the body beneath. The leather waistcoat was originally linked to the Fetish scene, but moved into mainstream dress. In the mid 1990s, when this outfit was acquired, some lesbians were also dressing in the same manner.\n\nPurchased. Registered File number 1994/1109.",
