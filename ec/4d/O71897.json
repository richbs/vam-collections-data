            "public_access_description": "This bronze statuette entiteled 'Victory' is made by Sir Alfred Gilbert ca. 1891.\n\nThis statuette was in the collection of the actor-manager Sir Henry Irving (1838-1905) at the time of his death. Apparently Gilbert often presented casts of it as gifts to his friends. The figure was originally designed to surmount the orb held by the figure of Queen Victoria in the Queen Victoria Jubilee Memorial in the Great Hall at Winchester Castle, which Gilbert executed in 1887.\n\nIt was the sculptor Thomas Brock (1847-1922), a member of the Museum's Council for Advice on Art, who recommended the figure for purchase. He wrote: 'I have inspected the small bronze statuette \"Victory\" by Alfred Gilbert R.A. lot 81 to be sold at Christie's tomorrow, and I consider it a very beautiful work and one which should, if possible, be acquired for the Museum.  This figure has evidently been cast under Mr Gilbert's supervision, therefore has additional value.'  A.B. Skinner, the Director of the Museum, added to Brock's comments: 'We are gradually forming a collection of bronze statuettes by artists of recent times, and among the most beautiful and valuable are those of Mr Gilbert.  It is not often that the work executed either by him or under his immediate supervision comes into the market - commercial replicas are to be had, but these we would rather not possess ... It is in every sense a beautiful figure and the bronze has a fine quality about it, so very different in tone to the examples found in the trade.' Another version exists in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, said to be identical to the present piece; a further example is in the Leeds City Art Gallery.\n\nGilbert exhibited a sketch model for the Victoria Jubilee Memorial at the Royal Academy in 1888 (now in the Academy's collection). The Royal Academy also owns a bronze figure of Victory.\n\nSir Alfred Gilbert (1854-1934) was a famous British sculptor of the late 19th century. He was also medallist, goldsmith and draughtsman. He was known for his inventiveness and characteristically used many different materials in the same work. He epitomised the movement known as the \u201cNew Sculpture\u201d, with a new focus on naturalistic forms. His many commissions included for example the celebrated figure of Eros, part of the Shaftsbury memorial.",
