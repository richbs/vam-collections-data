They were extremely cheap, costing only a few pence. \n\nHistory & Use\nA French visitor to London in the 1550s noted that the English drink beer 'not in glasses but in earthenware pots with silver handles and covers.'  The unique English fashion for mounted earthenware jugs reached its height in the mid 16th century. The mounts were generally in silver or silver gilt, richly decorated and heavily ornamented. They could cost between \u01531 and \u01533.\n\nMaterials & Technique\nThe jug is made of stoneware, a clay that has been fired at an extremely high temperature. This results in a hard, non-porous body. In this case, the body is known as 'tigerware' because of the mottled brown glaze. The handles of stoneware jugs were always the most vulnerable part.  The original handle on this jug must have been damaged beyond repair and so replaced with a silver one.\n\nOrnament\nThe decoration, with its caryatids, mythological scene and Latin inscription, is characteristic of the Renaissance style then current in England.",
