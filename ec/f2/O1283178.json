Variety and circus performers in the 19th century needed to have their own posters printed which could be sent to prospective managers when applying for work, and overposted with the name of venues.\n\nEdwin Moxon travelled all over the world performing a balancing and foot-juggling act in circuses and Variety theatres. He performed in Russia for seven years, spoke several languages fluently and had thirteen children. When they were old enough the two eldest children were trained to join him in the family act The Moxon Trio. His thirteenth child Eileen, who used the stage name Levanda, performed the act in circus and cabaret in the 1940s with her daughter Judy as Levanda and Van.  Judy went on to travel the world with the act independently in the 1960s, performing tricks that feature on this poster passed donw from her grandfather via her mother.",
