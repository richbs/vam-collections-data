Trimmed with black machine lace bows on the shoulders and bands at the wrist openings. High plain neckline and long tight sleeves with a seam on the inside of the arm and from the elbow to the wrist on the outside of the arm.\n\nThe dress is fitted and Princess line with a train and fastens down the entire length of the centre front with matching silk-covered worked buttons.\n\nThe skirt flares, deriving its shaping from two gored inserted in each side seam, and a single gore inserted in each of the back seams. There are self covered buttons stitched towards the apex of each gore to which are attached marked silk loops stitched below about 12 inches above the hem. When the loops are fastened over the buttons there is a looped draped effect.\n\nThere is a pocket in each side seam.\n\nThe dress is hand stitched and lined with pale-blue silk.\n[Belt] Belt trimmed at the fastening with a black lace ruche and with two pendant trimmings.",

The \"Princess Line\" was essentially a fitted dress made using long shaped panels to avoid a horizontal waist seam which separated the bodice from the skirt. Early examples of this style are rare.",
