Full Citation:\n\n\u201c<b>116 Unknown Man</b> \n<b>c.1660</b>\nP109-1910 \n<b>\nOval <b>75 x 62mm</b> \n</b>\nFeatures freely hatched in brown and sanguine with grey and dark brown, the remains of blue in the eyes, and much white blended into the coarseness of the hatching (see Condition), on a pale yellowish carnation ground; hair over the carnation washed with transparent pale brown, hatched with darker colour and heightened with pale grey; collar in pale grey hatched with blue and with white heightening; costume in very dark grey modelled with black; background a brown wash to the left, stippled with darker colour; \nto the right a landscape and sky in opaque blues, yellows and white; on vellum put down on a leaf from a table-book. \n\n<b>Condition:</b> Some losses in the margins; slight blackening to the lead-white heightening in the face; considerable areas of zinc-white retouching in the face and collar; rubs and damp spots, especially in the background. \n\n<b>Signed:</b> Not signed. \n\n<b>Frame:</b> A modern turned-wood frame, a bolection moulding of ebonised fruitwood, made for the miniature after receipt into the Museum. \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> George Salting, (1) acquired by him from an unrecorded source and bequeathed to the Museum, 1910. \n\n<b>Literature:</b> <i>Salting Collection</i>, 1911, p. 46 (as one of the group); Foster 1914-16, vol. II, p. 112, (presumably included in no. 56 'undescribed, Salting Collection'); Long 1929, p. 155; Long 1930, p. 28; <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 21. \n\nThe attribution to Flatman was by Long when the miniature came to the Museum. \n\nOn costume the date seems very early, perhaps even before c.1660, otherwise the accepted beginning of Flatman's oeuvre. The hatching in the face is freer and less systematic than in, for example, Cat. No. 122. Though compromised by zinc-white restoration, the use of lead-white in the face seems intended to give the features substance, rather than to produce the rich, creamy blended surface of contemporary Cooper. In design, with the placing of the figure in the oval somewhat back from the margins, the upward view of the sitter and the use of a landscape background, the portrait recalls the work of the younger Hoskins in the late 1640s and 1650s.Though no connection between them is documented, it would be surprising if their circles of acquaintance had not overlapped during Flatman's early years at the Bar. \n\n1 Salting Collection, no. 4624.\u201d",
