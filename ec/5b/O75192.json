            "public_access_description": "The art of painting miniature portraits on ivory originated in the work of Rosalba Carriera (1675-1757), a Venetian artist who began her career decorating the ivory tops of snuff boxes. With an eye for portraiture she soon began to paint portrait miniatures on ivory ovals separated from the snuff boxes and so established the practice that usurped the traditional use of vellum (animal skin) for miniatures. Cosway\u2019s portrait of Mrs Lowther was painted in the 1780s, and it is a charming example of the ivory miniature portrait back in its original decorative role on the lid of a snuff box. It is not known for whom this portrait was painted, but it was probably a gentleman. Interestingly, the gentle erotic appeal of this image of a young woman, with her knowing but shy look and her d\u00e9colletage, is that exploited so successfully by Carriera half a century earlier. Carriera was renowned for her alluring \u2018fancy pictures\u2019, ostensibly representations of \u2018the Elements\u2019 or \u2018the Seasons\u2019, but which were very much flesh-and-blood young women with what one commentator called a \u2018half shielded, interesting disarrangement of line at the bosom\u2019. But this portrait of Mrs Lowther is no allegory, and by the standards of 1780s England her dress is somewhat daring. And yet, like much of Carriera's work, more is left to the imagination than is presented to the eye. Cosway's style was perfectly suited to such hints of eroticism - light, airy and ultimately indistinct.",
