The surface is decorated on top of the blade and both sides of the handle by a scored, engraved effect that was achieved by irregular hammer blows with a sharply scored hammer face and which gives the surface a bright cut, crystalline appearance.  The server proves to be quite functional for both cake and pastry.",
