The vertical tapes form channels for the whalebone strips, which were then secured into place with bound edges.  The whalebone insertions fan out over the bust and hips, helping to create the fashionable curvaceous silhouette.  This type of design was known as a 'ventilated' corset and was suitable for sports and summer wear. The spaces in between the whalebone and cotton tapers were intended to allow air to circulate, enabling the skin to 'exhale' and perspiration to evaporate. This was one of the many 'health' innovations endorsed by manufacturers of late nineteenth century underwear. \n\nAs awareness increased of the damage caused by wearing corsets, many attempts were made to modify construction and spurious claims were frequently advertised to boost sales.",
