The furniture manufacturer Gordon Russell viewed rationing as a way to promote knowledge of good design. He sat on the Utility Furniture Advisory Committee, a group which oversaw the designs of Utility furniture. As the raw materials used to make domestic furniture were also scarce, Utility designs were simple, with little decoration. All furniture had to be very carefully considered to make the most functional pieces with the least materials. This mahogany sideboard is simply designed, yet beautifully made and typical of the designs of this era.",
