Foale and Tuffin considered wearability and practicality, and designed clothes that could be comfortably worn by active young women in a wide range of circumstances. This four-part interchangeable ensemble in lightweight wool is based around a tunic and trouser set, which is accompanied by a quilted jacket and a flounced and quilted pinafore dress in chequerboard and floral Liberty prints. The dress, jacket, trousers and tunic can be worn together in various combinations, or worn separately with other garments.\n\nThe ensemble was specially chosen by the designers to donate to the Cecil Beaton Collection as their most representative design for 1971. Beaton acquired garments from designers and the well-dressed elite of Europe and America. The collection was exhibited at the V&A in 1971, accompanied by a catalogue detailing its enormous range, and was subsequently presented to the Museum.",
