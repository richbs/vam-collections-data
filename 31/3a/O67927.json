            "public_access_description": "Toast racks, designed to hold a selection of toast on the breakfast table, first appeared in the 1780s as part of the general refinement of dining customs among the middle classes.  A variety of designs was initially explored (for example, articulated racks) before the simple arrangement of parallel arches became standard. \n\nSheffield plate originated with the discovery in about 1742 by a working cutler of Sheffield, Thomas Boulsover (1704-88), that bars of silver and copper, in unequal proportions, fused by heating under pressure, could be rolled into sheets of laminated metal and worked like silver.  The industry this material created, flourished for approximately one hundred years until superseded by electroplating in the 1840s.\n\nThe process Joseph Hancock (1711-1790) developed for the large-scale production fused plate (Sheffield plate) differed little throughout the course of the industry.  An ingot of copper was covered with a thin sheet of sterling silver.  These ingots were approximately 1\u00bd to 1\u00be inches thick and 2\u00bd inches wide by 8 inches long.  This could vary according to the weight and size of the plated sheet that was required to be made.  Generally speaking, however, the thickness of the silver sheet was 1/40 that of the copper block which meant that 10-12 oz of silver was used for every 8 lbs of copper.\n\nManufacturers of toast racks took advantage of improvements in the manufacture of fused plate wire and many of their pieces are made almost entirely of sections of wire soldered together. From the 1760s fused plate wire was made in the rolling mills, a thin strip of sterling silver being bent round a circular copper ingot about one inch in diameter. After fusion had taken place under the influence of heating in the furnace, the bar was drawn through a series of holes of 'whortles', these decreasing in size until wire of the requisite diameter was created. Wire work objects and dishes first became popular in the 1780s, and continued to be manufactured well into the 19th century.",
