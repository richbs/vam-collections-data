The two heads are moulded separately. The group corresponds in reverse with an engraving of a lost fountain group by Tribolo in the Villa Casarotta at San Casciano. The site of the Tribolo fountain in the garden of the Villa Casarotta can still be identified, but the fountain seems to have been dismantled in the 19th century and the central group has disappeared.\n\nTribolo was an Italian sculptor, engineer and garden designer, who was apprecnticed in Florence first as a wood-carver with Giovanni d'Alesso d'Antonio and then as a sculptor with Jacopo Sansovino, whom he continued to assist well into the second decade of the 16th century.\n\nTribolo worked (with a team of other sculptors) on the basilica of the Santa Casa at Loreto and in 1533 he completed Andrea Sansovino's marble high relief of the Marriage of the Virgin  which began 1527 and he also helped Michelangelo to complete the Medici tombs in S Lorenzo.\n\nTribolo also worked around 12 years  for Cosimo I in Florence and undertook an extraordinary wide array of works: decorations for state occasions, firework displays, theatrical costumes and d\u00e9cor as well as water conservation and other hydraulic projects. His most influential undertaking was the laying out of the Boboli Gardens behind the Pitti Palace in Florence.",

            "history_note": "The group has all the appearance of having been moulded from a highly finished original in  bronze or marble. The two heads are moulded separately. The group corresponds in reverse with an engraving of a lost fountain group by Tribolo in the Villa Casarotta at San Casciano. The site of the Tribolo fountain in the garden of the Villa Casarotta can still be identified, but the fountain seems to have been dismantled in the 19th century and the central group has disappeared.\nAcquired in Florence.",
