Partial elevation and section of a picture frame with scallop shells at the corner. Danson Park is a small villa designed by Sir Robert Taylor begun in 1762. Before the building was complete Chambers was brought in to decorate the interiors, c.1766-c.1770. He also designed a wooden bridge based on the Palladian model, and a temple in the garden. It is drawn by another office hand.\n\nChambers was born in Sweden and died in London. He travelled widely, visiting China, and studied architecture at the Ecole des Arts, Paris, from 1749 and in Italy from 1750 to 1755.  Many of his drawings from this period are contained in his important 'Franco-Italian' album, held in the V&A.  Chambers moved to London in 1755 and published his influential Treatise on Civil Architecture in 1759.  Chambers demonstrated the breadth of his style in buildings such as Gower (later Carrington) House and Melbourne House, London, in such country houses as Duddingston, Scotland, and in the garden architecture he designed for Wilton House, Wiltshire, and at Kew Gardens. He became head of government building in 1782, and in this capacity built Somerset House, London.",
