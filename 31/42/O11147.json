Such tiles appear regularly  in houses decorated in the Arts and Crafts style, and were used widely by exponents of vernacular architecture such as Richard Norman Shaw (1831-1912). The most common setting for such tiles was in and around the fireplace.\n\nPeople\nWilliam Morris's love of medieval imagery is well known. In addition,  however, he shared with many of his contemporaries a keen interest in vernacular British architecture and decorative art of the 17th and 18th centuries. This enthusiasm is demonstrated in his approach to tile making. This was carried out using a variation of the techniques that had previously been employed by the manufacturers of tin-glazed earthenware (delftware) tiles.\n\nDesign & Designing\nWilliam Morris's inspiration for such simple flower patterns as these, used on both tiles and embroideries, came from medieval herbals as well as the 18th-century Dutch and British tradition of flower-painted tin-glazed tiles. This 'Primrose' pattern relates closely to the embroidery designs for the Red House, Morris's own home.",
