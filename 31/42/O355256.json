The dress has a square neck with a large, square, falling collar and elbow length, triple puffed tulle sleeves. The bodice is made from horizontally pleated tulle and at the front, lines of silver braid and a panel of machine-made lace in Venetian, 17th century style suggest a stomacher. The skirt is shirred on to the bodice with a pleated, cream silk sash at the waist. There is a wide, decorative band above the hem, composed over silver appliqu\u00e9 motifs, embroidery cut out panels, beads and the lace, as above. Bands of the same descend form the front waist to suggest a petticoat opening. The skirt is trained.\nThe bodice is boned, lined with cream satin and fastens with hooks at the front. There is a gathering ribbon through the top of the lining.\nThe skirt is unlined but the voided decoration suggests that it was worn over, perhaps, a cream satin petticoat, now missing.",
