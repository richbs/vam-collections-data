These functional objects provided a chance for the host to impress guests with his or her wealth and taste. Sugar bowls could be quite large, with separate stands. They were bought singly, in pairs or up to eight at a time (the Prince Regent purchased eight sugar vases in 1811). A quantity of bowls purchased together suggest they were intended for a long dining table.\n\nPeople\nThis sugar bowl was made by Digby Scott and Benjamin Smith the Elder (died 1822), who managed a workshop for the Royal Goldsmiths Rundell, Bridge & Rundell at Greenwich from about 1801 to 1807. It was ordered from the firm by Charles Sutton in 1805, the year he became Archbishop of Canterbury.",
