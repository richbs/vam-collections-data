            "physical_description": "Cover of brocaded cotton with a central field of formal stylised foliage curling from symmetrical medallions enclosing brightly coloured flower motifs and small birds. The main colour is maroon which, where wool from a different batch of dye has been used, has faded to tan colour in stripes across the cover. The smaller motifs are of wool and silk in bright green, red, turquoise, mauve, yellow and page orange. The stripes, which shade every unfilled portion of the white cotton ground, are also in these colours.\n\nAt each end are two borders, without any of the maroon wool, but with a little black silk added to the other colours. The inner border has three plants in vases, flanking two medallions in green wool, containing a bird in bright red wool and supporting a mauve wool bird. The outer border consists of three vases of flowers flanked by small adorsed peacocks and large confronted peacocks. Spaces around these large motifs are filled with tiny flower motifs and birds.\n\nThe edges of the cover are bound with pale blue silk. The cover is lined with printed cotton with a design of large interlinking rings of ribbon and flowers encircling bunches of fruit on a brown ground. The colours used are shades of brown and yellow with a little white and grey, enlivened by a bright blue, blueish-green and pink.",
