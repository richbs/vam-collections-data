Anthonie [Stevers] Palamedes, (b Delft, 1601; d Amsterdam, 1673) was a Dutch painter. His teacher is unknown, but he may have studied in Delft with the court painter Michiel van Mierevelt and/or Hendrik Pot, who was in the city in 1620. Palamedes joined the Delft Guild of St Luke in 1621. In 1673 Anthonie was residing in Amsterdam, probably with his eldest son, the painter Palamedes Palamedes II.  Anthonie was a genre, portrait and still-life painter but is best known for his paintings depicting musical or merry companies and soldiers. Such works attest to his knowledge of contemporary genre paintings by Haarlem and Amsterdam artists, such as Dirck Hals, Pieter Codde, Willem Duyster and Hendrik Pot. In the 1640s and 1650s Palamedesz. often painted guardroom scenes and soldiers with their camp followers in stables, adopting compositions recalling designs by Duyster and Jacob Duck but executed in a looser, less refined technique. Palamedes painted several different composition depicting a trumpeter with a clarion flag hung from his instrument. The trumpeter's task in the Dutch army was to alert all the soldiers in the guardroom (cortegaard) to march out of the military unit following a commander's orders.",

In 1621 he joined the painters' guild in Delft. One of his pupils was his brother, the battle-painter, Palamedes Palamedesz. (1607-38). \n\n\n265\nTHE TRUMPETER \nSigned lower left <i>A. Palamedes, 1654</i> \nOak panel \n14 \u00bc X 19 (36.7 X 48) Townshend Bequest \n1350-1869\n\nAs was his custom, Palamedes repeated this composition, with variations in the figures and the setting, numerous times (for example, Hoech collection sale, Munich, 19 Sept. 1892, lot 161, dated 1653; Lathom sale, Christie's, 11 June 1926, lot 79, dated 1656; Guggenheim sale, Parke-Bernet, New York, 31 Jan.-3 Feb. 1945, lot 501, dated 1665; H\u00f4tel Drouot sale, 29 May 1967, lot 119.) All of these have the standing trumpeter, but differ from 1350-1869 in showing him more or less frontally, his head facing right, holding the trumpet with his left hand. A similar composition showing the trumpeter seated is in the National Museum, Warsaw. \n\nCondition. Cleaned in 1960, when the signature reappeared. The panel seems to have been slightly cut down on the sides. \nProv. Seen by Waagen in the Rev. C. H. Townshend's library in 1854 or '56; bequeathed to the Museum in 1868. \nLit.

His teacher is unknown, but he may have studied in Delft with the court painter Michiel van Mierevelt and/or Hendrik Pot, who was in the city in 1620. Palamedes joined the Delft Guild of St Luke in 1621. In 1673 Anthonie was residing in Amsterdam, probably with his eldest son, the painter Palamedes Palamedes II.  Anthonie was a genre, portrait and still-life painter but is best known for his paintings depicting musical or merry companies and soldiers. Such works attest to his knowledge of contemporary genre paintings by Haarlem and Amsterdam artists, such as Dirck Hals, Pieter Codde, Willem Duyster and Hendrik Pot. In the 1640s and 1650s Palamedesz. often painted guardroom scenes and soldiers with their camp followers in stables, adopting compositions recalling designs by Duyster and Jacob Duck but executed in a looser, less refined technique. Palamedes painted several different composition depicting a trumpeter with a clarion flag hung from his instrument. The trumpeter's task in the Dutch army was to alert all the soldiers in the guardroom (<i>cortegaard</i>) to march out of the military unit following a commander's orders.",

These pictures often depict scenes of everyday life set in domestic interiors or in the countryside. Scholars continue to debate whether they bear a metaphorical meaning and hidden messages, or just feature a close depiction of contemporary events. In both case they are associated with health, pleasure and liberty.",
