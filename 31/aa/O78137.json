It can only be used for the reproduction of line drawings or flat areas without intermediary tones.  Aubrey Beardsley (1872-1898) was one of the first artists to make drawings specifically for reproduction by line-block.  The name of Carl Hentschel, who engraved many line-blocks after Beardsley's drawings, is to be found at the bottom right corner of this poster.\n\nPeople\nAubrey Beardsley, artist and illustrator, was a leading light in the English Aesthetic Movement.  Originally encouraged by Sir Edward Burne-Jones (1833-1898), he became an admirer of the artist James McNeill Whistler (1834-1903), under whose influence he studied Japanese prints. Beardsley achieved fame illustrating Oscar Wilde's 'Salome' and the first volume of 'The Yellow Book'. His masterly use of black and white line and sinuous, curving compositions expressed the spirit of the international art movement Art Nouveau.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe quarterly 'Yellow Book' was devoted to the Aesthetic and Decadent Movements. When it was first published in 1894, it became an immediate success with the avant-garde of art and literature. Beardsley's spirited designs, and its flaunting yellow covers, helped to make it a sensation.",
