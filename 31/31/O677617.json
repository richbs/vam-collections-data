In the background right people are carrying goods or counting money and on the left a man is handing money over to one of the men on the platform. A couple leave via steps to the right of the background; over the staircase is a window through which an onlooker watches the scene. Through a square opening on the right is a landscape with tree.\n\nThis print is in the same direction as the cartoon from which it is derived and is faithful in compositional detail except that the image is taller and the top of the drape and the figures climbing the stairs are therefore more visible.",

They illustrate passages from the Bible concerning the lives of Saint Peter and Saint Paul. None of them is smaller than ten feet high by thirteen feet wide. They belong to Her Majesty the Queen and have been on loan to this museum since 1865. The earliest print relating to the Raphael Cartoons dates from 1516, the year in which Raphael received final payment for the commission. It inaugurates an extraordinary case study in the history of printmaking, stretching over more than four hundred and fifty years and across a wide range of printmaking techniques. This print is in reverse of the cartoon from which it is derived, and therefore is in the same direction as the tapestry.",
