At first glance, this seems to be a table top in scagliola, a form of decoration that takes its name from the Italian word scaglia or 'flakes'.  It is made of ground selenite, mixed with natural colourings, and is worked to give the appearance of inlaid marble or pietre dure, which was was often inlaid into a black ground in the most famous workshops in Florence and Paris.  The little scenes at the corners, with their soft colours, are closer to the effect of scagliola, while the roundels with the birds, are very similar to motifs common in pietre dure work.  The monogram on the shield in the centre has not yet been identified.  The highly naturalistic flowers, including roses, anenomes, narcissi, jasmine, carnations, hyacinths and tulips, are similar to the wreaths of flowers painted by Flemish artists such as Jan Breughel the Elder (1568-1625), who used them in still lives and to surround religious scenes such as the Madonna and Child.",
