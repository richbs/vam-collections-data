            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nThese quarries (small diamond-shaped panels) of stained glass were first recorded at  Betley Hall  in Staffordshire, home of the Tollet family, in the 18th century. The glass may have been made before the mansion was built in the early 17th century. They were salvaged when the building was demolished in 1783, and leaded into a window in a new house built on the site. An increasing proportion of glass made towards the end of Elizabeth I's reign (1588-1603) was destined for domestic interiors. Glass painters often referred to prints for inspiration. Some of the figures in these quarries are thought to be based on an engraving by the prolific German printmaker Israhel van Meckenem (born around 1440-1445, died 1503).\n\nSubject Depicted\nThe Morris dance was an element of festivities at court and at popular communal celebrations in Tudor England. Its participants were commonly depicted in art of the period. Arranged around a maypole (a tall decorated pole) are a fool, six dancers wearing bells, a man on a hobby horse and another playing a 'pipe and tabor' - a type of flute played with a small drum. The female figure in the centre pane on the bottom of the window is likely to represent the Queen of May.\nThese quarries date from a period when coloured window glass became increasingly scarce. As a result, a method was devised for painting white glass with coloured enamels. This enabled glass painters to produce far more detailed compositions than before. Most colours were made from ground up glass and fixed by firing in a kiln, but the blue used here was not produced until 1550 at the earliest. Layers of silver-based stain were also used to achieve various tones of yellow.",

            "bibliography": "Nicol, E.J. 'Some notes on the history of the Betley Window'. <u>English Folk Dance and Song Society Journal</u>. Reprint no.7. London, 1953.\nNicol dates the window to the early 16th century on the basis of the costume of the figures and in defiance of the advice of Bernard Rackham, Keeper of Ceramics at the V&A. Rackham stated that the technique of enamel painting on glass had not advanced enough before 1550, at the earliest, to produce the colour blue. He refers to the probable source of some of the figures - an engraving of around 1460-70 by Israhel van Meckenem. While there can be no doubt that this engraving was a direct, or more likely in-direct, source, there is no reason to suppose, as Nicol does, that the window itself dates from the late 15th or early 16th centuries. Nicol raises several red herrings including his belief that the penants attached to the maypole celebrate the marriage of Catherine of Aragon and Henry VIII.\n\nUnpublished correspondence relating to the Betley Window is contained in the Nominal File for E.J.Nicol, held by Registry.",
