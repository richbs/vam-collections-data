PALMER \n\nGenerally, this exhibition shows very clearly how, in Palmer's work, most careful analysis went hand in hand with most imaginative designing. If, in etching, he had tapped the great resources of his analytical knowledge and draughtsmanship, now and then (as for instance the magnificent and very ancient tree trunks of Lullingstone Park), I am inclined to think that he might have done etched work as much to Ruskin's satisfaction as the tree-drawing which Ruskin eulogises in <i>Modern Painters</i>. \nWith the public verdict of seventy-four years (although I have not seen a tenth part of it), I feel content, and more than content. It has been kindly to a very high degree, even when written by those whose sympathies were almost entirely with etching of a totally different school. It has been, so far as I know, unanimous both in the press and privately. Maybe, that some day Mr. Rossetti's prophecy will be fulfilled - namely, that the realistic side of Palmer's art \"on which he touches the many,\" will cause his work to grow in influence. \nOne of the objects of this exhibition was to demonstrate that the purely realistic and analytical side of that art was, from the very first, closely allied with the purely imaginative - that he continually turned from one to the other - thus vindicating Edgar Allan Poe's words: \"It will be found that the ingenious are always fanciful and the truly imaginative never otherwise than analytic.\" \nIn all Palmer's art-teaching, or in the examples he made for his pupils' use, there was not one attempt to inoculate them with those artistic ideals by which, if his name goes down to posterity, he will be known. But there was a ceaseless effort to emphasize the importance of that universally unpopular pair, \"Elements and Accuracy.\" \nAlthough my father once wrote that the destruction of an etched plate seemed to him like \"the murder of a mind,\" I have followed the best advice in Europe most generously given at the cost of much time and trouble, and all the plates in my possession have been finally cancelled by one of the usual methods. This is a fate far more merciful than that they should have been ultimately sold and condemned to the lingering death and dishonour which has befallen plates by illustrious hands. \nThree eminent artists and etchers have, out of regard for Samuel Palmer's work and memory, done that memory the honour to attend to the plates' obsequies. They have done this even to printing some of the final impressions with their own hands. In the whole of my father's life there was no such incident as this. The devotion of the \"Ancients\" to each other was as nothing to it. For brevity's sake I gave to the three artists the name of \"The Trio.\" When any future collector sees the little equilateral triangle which symbolizes the three etchers (and also their initials F. S., F. L. G. and M.H.,) on the margin of an etching by their fellow craftsman, he will know that of all the kindly things which have been written and done in connection with Samuel Palmer and his work, none approaches theirs.\n\n[\u2026] \n\nADDITIONAL NOTES. \n\n<i>General Note on the Etchings</i>. - Although some of the best impressions of his etchings were sold or given away by Samuel Palmer, nearly all those which I have contributed to this Exhibition were, for various reasons, among his especial treasures. They also represent many days of intense agony and \"grated consciousness\" by the side of the inanimate and animate machines which he had to deal with. Of the various states I myself know little. For that knowledge \"The Trio\" must be consulted. - A.H.P.'",
