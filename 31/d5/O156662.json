            "public_access_description": "This pouring vessel, one of a pair, was given by Daniel Hollingworth to St Augustine's church in the City of London in 1631.The English Reformation allowed lay people to take communion wine and thus created a need for vessels to hold the wine. This was often met by gifts of domestic plate that was no longer in fashion. \n\nThis object would once have been part of the buffet. The buffet of plate was an important feature of medieval and Renaissance banquets. Often made of oak or walnut, buffets usually stood at the side of a dining room, their shelves filled with tablewares. Gold and silver vessels were displayed to convey a sense of the owner's wealth. Normally these vessels were used for the service of food and drink, but on great state occasions they would be set out purely for display.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world\u2019s great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
