            "physical_description": "Bed cover of embroidered white linen with coloured silks in back, satin and long and short stitched with laid and couched work. With a lozenge diaper background pattern worked in yellow back stitch in imitation of quilting. The main part consists of a large square panel with a circular arrangement in the centre of exotic flowers and leaves, and scrolls and rosettes. In each corner is an arrangement of exotic flowers, leaves and scrolls. The remainder of the space is filled by trailing vine stems bearing leaves, grapes and coiling tendrils. Around the edge is a border of two interlacing wavy lines worked in red and pale blue.\n\nAttached to three sides of the panel are borders ornamented with motifs based on a V-shape between two scrolls from which spring flowers, buds and leaves. On the fourth side, a deeper border is worked with similar motifs set at right angles to the main part of the cover. Parts of two of the borders have no pattern on them other than the diaper, and are pierced by buttonholes.\n\nThe colours are crimson, pink, buff, blues and shades of green and yellow.\n\nThe pattern has been drawn in ink on the cover, and much of this is visible as the embroidery has never been finished. Parts of the design were intended to be carried out in raised work as they have been partially covered by very thick threads, probably intended as a foundation. The cover is lined with coarse linen. Much of the embroidery has been worked through both layers of the material.",
