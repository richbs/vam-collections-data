No. 120, which was at that time regarded as a self-portrait. He also noted: 'a good min. Face painted with a lot of thin, flowing strokes. Face yellowish, but many strokes are red or brown. Grey dress. Sky bgd., mostly clouded (grey).' Despite this approbation, the miniature does not seem to be referred to in the Flatman entry in Long 1929. Carl Winter, who had been Long's colleague and apprentice, was much involved in the choice of this miniature by the Memorial Committee during 1937 -8. The Duke of Buccleuch wrote to Iolo Williams: 'Mr Winter might be interested to know that the miniature was bought in 1898 through Messrs P. and D. Colnaghi', (1) - a statement that gives the clue to the possible Howard provenance of the portrait (see also Cooper, Cat. No. 62), and which discloses incidentally, Winter's self-effacing role in researching the portrait. If the miniature had been loose on the market in the nineteenth century, it could also be the same as that which was then in the possession of Mrs Hoadly, referred to by Horace Walpole in his piece on Flatman in the <i>Anecdotes</i>. \n\nShe was the first wife of Benjamin Hoadly (1676-1761), Bishop successively of Bangor, Hereford, Salisbury and Winchester. She was born Sarah Curtis, had been a pupil of Mary Beale, and was, before her marriage, something of a portrait painter. Coming from this background, and having known people who had been close to Flatman, Sarah Hoadly would be less likely than most to have been mistaken about his appearance. The miniature in question evidently remained with the Bishop after Sarah died in 1743, and it turned up again, 'late in the possession of Mrs Hoadly' in the catalogue (p. 122) of stock at 'Mr Richardson's Print Warehouse, Castle Street, Leicester Square' in 1791, priced at 10 gns.\n\nSubsequently, a Self-Portrait was shown by J Heywood Hawkins at South Kensington in 1865 (no. 1901), but there is no means of telling whether this was the Hoadly miniature, or indeed one of the other images that became identified as self-portraits (see Cat. No. 120 [Dyce 95]).\n\nReynolds' 1947 Burlington article remains the definitive statement of the case for calling this miniature a self-portrait.\" Briefly, the case rests on comparison of the likeness with the Faithorne mezzotint after a lost portrait by Hayls, of which there is an impression in the British Museum; also an engraving in reverse by R White, published as the frontispiece to the 1682 and 1686 editions of Flatman's Poems and Songs. The similarity of features and of manifest character between these three images is beyond doubt. Their conjunction provides the standard for judging other possible likenesses, including the portraits in large at the NPG and at Knole House, in Kent, both of which are questionable by this standard. \n\nOn the technical qualities of self-portraiture, Jim Murrell ' has made the interesting point that the character of the line in the features here has a 'frantic' quality, the effect of the artist's own movement as he looks to and fro between mirror and painting and 'clings' to the likeness. \n\nI MS letter 10 August 1938, preserved in department files.\n2 Reynolds 1947. \n3 Personal communication.\u201d \n<u>Victoria and Albert Museum, Department of Engraving, Illustration and Design and Department of Paintings, Accessions 1938</u>, London: Board of Education, 1939.\nThe full text of the record is as follows:\n\n<b>'FLATMAN, Thomas (1635-1688).</b>\n\nMiniature self-portrait.\n<I>Signed</i> TF (monogr.) <I> and dated</i> 1673.\n<I>On parchment on card.
