They were applied to the paper on a single plate, rather than printing each colour in a separate operation. The printmaker dabbed the coloured inks onto the plate before each impression was printed by means of rag balls attached to the end of a stick. Paintings by George Morland (1763-1804) were popular with the British public during his lifetime, and were widely reproduced and published by printmakers both in Britain and in France and Germany.",
