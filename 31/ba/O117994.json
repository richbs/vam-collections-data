It was said that 'the history of the firm was to a large extent the history of the cutlery trade in Sheffield'. The 'Knife of Kings and the King of Knives', was one popular slogan. The Rodgers famous trademark was the Star and Maltese Cross which was confirmed to Joseph Rodgers by the Company of Cutlers in 1764. By the 19th century Joseph Rodgers reputation had grown to become the best-known pocket cutlery brand in the world and in some cultures the firm's name was even assimilated into the native language as a phrase meaning 'the very best.' In 1820 the firms reputation was aided when it won a royal warrant, which allowed the royal cypher to be added to its mark. \n\nCameo embossing involves printing the surround of the image, leaving the image itself embossed but not printed. Security printing was devised to prevent forgery or counterfeiting of lottery tickets and banknotes. Here, the process has been used for its decorative effect and its associations of distinction and integrity.",
