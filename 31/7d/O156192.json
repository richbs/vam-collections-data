The embroidery has been cut across the top and the ground fabric at the sides and bottom has been trimmed right up to the embroidery. There is a border along the bottom which extends a little way up the sides: outward facing pansy-like flowers outlined with dark brown.  Along the bottom this border is sandwiched between 2 narrow green bands containing small circular blossoms in pinks and yellows.\nThe pattern is a series of diagonal lines from lower right to upper left.  These are chevron lines in yellow and green.\nThere are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: blocks filled with either a pink and green flower or a blue and white flower.\n[2] wider stripe in two designs: [a] dark brown ground with a large pink flower with pointed petals facing right and a large circular bush of white flowers.\n[b] dark brown ground with an arrangement of 4 pink flowers, 3 with a purple centre and one blue flowers and a spray of 3 white flowers and 1 blue one.\nThreads: Silk, 2S: red, dark brown, green, light green, white, yellow, blue, grey [faded from purple], purple [which has faded more on the back than on the front].",
