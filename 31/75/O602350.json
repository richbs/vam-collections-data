Dorothy George, <u>Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires in the British Museum</u>, IX, 1949\nThe text of the record (as transcribed into British Museum online catalogue) is as follows:\n\n\"The Lord Chancellor (Eldon), preceded by his mace-bearer holding a sword, is about to alight on the pavement outside Westminster Hall (left), having flown diagonally down from the right; next him is (?) the Vice-Chancellor Plumer, close behind are eight other judges followed by a closely packed swarm of barristers who recede in perspective. All are in wig and gown. Behind the barristers are their clerks, wearing top-hats and carrying (green) brief-bags over their shoulders. Three men stand outside the door of Westminster Hall waiting obsequiously to receive the Chancellor and his swarm; one is a constable holding his staff, the others wear black gowns, the foremost having cloven hoofs. In the street below (right) a few terrified pedestrians look up at the monstrous flight. Above the design: 'First Day of Term'. After the title: \"A Darksome cloud of Locusts swarming down. \n\nThe other judges are Sir Vicary Gibbs, Ellenborough (both recognizable), with (presumably) the Chief Baron, Thomson, (see No. 12788), and the three other Barons of the Exchequer, Sir Robert Graham, Sir George Wood, Sir Richard Richards, and the Recorder, Silvester, see No. 12814. In the first flight of the barristers are probably the Attorney- and Solicitor-Generals, Garrow and Shepherd. Cf. No. 11411, 'The First Day of Term\u2014or, the Devil among the Lawyers.\"",
