The very early beads often had symbolic or amuletic value, and in some instances they were used as currency. The desire for beads as personal adornment is universal to all cultures and continues through to this day in a contemporary approach. \n\nAxel Russmeyer has a vast collection of antique and contemporary beads and pearls from which he selects his compositions of \u2018beaded beads\u2019. Only one type of bead is used for each sphere but variety comes with the selection of spheres to be threaded together. In this necklace subtle textures and shades of grey are explored. Evoking heirlooms, he has sometimes created boxes with Renaissance portraits to present his pieces.",
