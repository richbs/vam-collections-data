In the case of this teapot, the potter has simply made the feet in the form of three dog or lion finials, turned upside-down.\n\nMaterials & Making\nAlthough Josiah Wedgwood later laid claim to the development and perfection of cream-coloured earthenware, its history in fact extended as far back as the experiments of Enoch Booth of Tunstall in the 1740s. This was a period when major innovations in technique were occurring, such as slip-casting, press-moulding and enamel painting. These no doubt demanded a refined earthenware body which could be mass-produced, in the same way as red earthenware and white salt-glazed stoneware.\n\nThis teapot forms part of a group of early creamwares centred around a piece signed and dated 'EB 1743', which is generally considered to have been made by one of the most eminent potters of that period, Enoch Booth. Its experimental nature is demonstrated as much by its material as by its non-Staffordshire style of decoration. The underglaze blue painting is almost certainly the work of an itinerant Liverpool delftware painter, who may also have utilised the delftware (and Chinese) technique of leaving white lobed cartouches surrounded by powdered ground-colour. This is perhaps the earliest Staffordhire attempt at underglaze decoration (decoration applied under a transparent glaze).",
