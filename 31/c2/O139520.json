It depicts the rioters invading the stage while the text parodies the libretto of Arne's opera Artaxerxes which was being performed. The libretto reveals the increasing anxiety of the performers: 'They'll throw the Seats about our Ears/ And tear the Boxes down', while the rioters in the audience encourage the mayhem: 'Either your house, your pride, or price must come down!'  A lot of damage was done to the theatre that night, with benches torn up, chandeliers smashed and the linings of the boxes cut to pieces.\n\nThe Covent Garden riot, caused by the theatre withdrawing half-price tickets for those who came to the theatre after the main play to see the after-piece, followed a similar incident at Drury Lane Theatre the previous month. This was also led by Fitzpatrick who had been engaged in a feud since the 1750s with Drury Lane's owner, the actor David Garrick.  Finally tiring of Fritzpatrick's behaviour in the theatre when he would whinny with laughter during sombre scenes, Garrick attacked Fitzpatrick in his 1761 poem The Fribbleriad. Although Garrick didn't run Covent Garden Theatre, it was owned by his friend and supporter John Beard. Both managers eventually succombed to the rioters' demands.",

The Gentleman's Magazine reported what ensued:\n 'A riot happened at Covent-Garden theatre, occasioned by a demand being made for full prices at the opera of Artaxerxes. The mischief done was the greatest ever known on any occasion of the like kind: all the benches of the boxes and pit being entirely tore up, the glasses and chandeliers broken, and the linings of the boxes cut to pieces. The rashness of the rioters was so great, that they cut away the wooden pillars between the boxes, so if the inside of them had not been iron, they would have brought down the galleries upon their heads. The damages done amount to at least 2000 l. Four persons concern'd in the riot have been committed to the Gatehouse.'",
