The body and the lid compose an unbroken whole, with alternating rows of leaves forming the body and continuing without interruption into the growing shoot on the lid.  The leaves are etched with fine veins.  The spout and handle also reflect the shape of bamboo. Covered with a crackled celadon glaze. There was a small loop on the handle to thread a cord but this has broken off. There is a serious crack on the handle , probably resulting from the firing rather than later damage.",

Praised for their outstanding beauty as reflected in their sumptuous glazes, refined forms and elegant decorations, they are seen to exemplify one of the highlights of Korean culture. The word \u2018celadon\u2019 derives from the colour of the robe worn by Celadon, hero of L\u2019Astr\u00e9e, a pastoral drama by Honor\u00e9 d\u2019Urf\u00e9, a French dramatist of the seventeenth century. Today the term is used for both Chinese and Korean stonewares with glazes of grey-green to bluish-green hues. \nMany Koryo celadon wares illustrate a fondness for natural shapes as for example seen in the many ewers which were modelled after melons, gourds and bamboo shoots. This is a celadon ewer in the form of a bamboo shoot. It has a decoration of carved and incised lines. The lid has a loop so that it can be attached to the body with a cord. The foot is unglazed. Several ewers of this kind were made during the first half of the 12th century.",
