The value of such items was often many times as great as that of ordinary glasses and bottles which were used in much greater quantities.\nElaborately decorated glass dishes were used for display or occasional practical use at the table during special banquets. Small dishes on a low foot, like this example, could be used for serving cold food, most likely fruit or sweetmeats, during one of the desert courses.",
