According to the playbills advertising their appearance at the Royal Surrey Theatre in the summer, autumn and winter of 1836, their performances there had been: 'the theme of such universal wonder and admiration during the last four months' because of the 'astonishing nature' of their performance which had to be seen to be appreciated. The names of the troupe were given on the playbills as 'Sidi Ali, Abdallah, Ahmed, Hossein, Mohammed, Hassan Etc.' \n\nThese woodcut images of the Bedouins' act would have been cut from a larger poster, the perpetrator of the cutting and pasting clearly believing that the images were of more importance than the accompanying text, so we do not know where they were performing when these images were made, but it is likely to have been for one of their London venues in 1836 or 1837. The establishment commissioning these posters clearly knew that illustrations such as these, although espensive to produce, would be great publicity for this act.",
