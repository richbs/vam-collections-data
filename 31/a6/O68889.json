Unusually, he steps from the tomb with his left foot, his body slightly turned to the left of the panel. He treads on the left arm of a soldier, who wears a pointed basinet and a tippet of mail, a low-belted jupon, gauntlets and armour on his arms and legs. He lies across the front of the panel, leaning against a raised piece of ground, and holds in his right hand a spear which lies on the ground beside him. Three similar soldiers, who apparently are awake and gazing at Christ, are represented on the panel. One kneels on the right of the tomb, holding a battle-axe in his left hand, a second standing behind him. A third soldier is behind the tomb on the left of the panel, holding in his right hand a spear or battle-axe which rests on the ground in front of the tomb.\n\nThere are many breaks in the panel with much filling in with plaster. The top corners of the panel and a small piece on the lower right side are restorations. Most of Christ's cross-staff and parts of the soldiers' battle-axes are missing. The left arm of the recumbent soldier has been broken off and his left leg is restored in plaster. The left leg of the soldier in the bottom right of the panel is restored in plaster.\n\nWhile traces of the original paint appear to survive, especially the usual daisy pattern on a green ground at the bottom of the panel, much of the carving has been overpainted, evidently to conceal the damage and repairs. The panel has been completely backed with plaster.",
