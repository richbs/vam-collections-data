Heather was daughter of the affluent Member of Parliament Sir Thomas Firbank. Her brother was the novelist Ronald Firbank. According to his biographer, Miriam J. Benkovitz, Heather favoured 'exquisite clothes of a heather colour to complement her name'. \n\nIn 1921 Heather's expensive clothes, bought from leading houses, were packed into trunks and put into storage, where they remained for the next 35 years. In 1960 the V&A acquired well over 100 items from her wardrobe. This collection forms an invaluable record of a stylish and wealthy woman's taste between about 1905 and 1920. Many items appeared in an exhibition at the V&A in 1960. It was called 'Lady of Fashion: Heather Firbank and what she wore between 1908 and 1921'.",
