            "public_access_description": "China had a long tradition of producing porcelain and its wares formed a valuable part of trade with western Europe. In 1708 a method of producing porcelain was discovered in Germany and, under noble patronage, a porcelain factory was established at Meissen near Dresden. The Meissen factory specialised in producing high quality tableware. In particular, they made pieces associated with the \u2018exotic\u2019 new food and drink stuffs entering Europe from Asia, the Americas and West Indies, which increasingly graced the tables of fashionable and wealthy homes.\n\nMany Meissen pieces reflect the period\u2019s interest in the \u2018exotic\u2019. This cup and saucer, for example, depict two exotic figures. One, on the side of the cup, is a black figure in what would have been considered Turkish dress with a turban, long robe and sash into which a dagger has been tucked. The other, on the saucer, wears a feather headdress, a cape and holds aloft an arrow. His dress associates him with allegorical images of \u2018America\u2019 but the landscape appears more North African. This mixture of styles and influences in picturing the exotic were typical of the time and apparent in the portrait and costume books from which porcelain designers drew inspiration.",
