His initials, 'RC' for Richard Cobham,  form the central feature of the table top. The front apron bears the armorial crest of the Temple family. Both crest and initials are crowned with a baron's coronet.\n\nPlace\nStowe was built in the late 17th century by Sir Richard Temple but radically altered and expanded by his son, the Ist Viscount Cobham, from around 1718. Although it is now more famous for its gardens, the house once had 'some of the finest Rooms in Europe'. It was furnished with 'gilded carvings, glasses and sconces, elegant tables, gilded furniture'. This side table formed part of a set of gilded furniture that included a chest and a fire screen, now also in the V&A. \n\nMaterials & Making\nWhen first made, this table would have resembled solid gold. This bright, shiny effect was achieved by 'water gilding'. First the decoration was built up in gesso, a kind of plaster. Details were then cut into the gesso, using special punches on the table top. A red clay ground or 'bole' was painted over the gesso to enrich the colour of the gold. This was wetted just before the sheets of gold leaf were applied. Finally, the raised areas were burnished with agate (a hardstone) or a dog's tooth to achieve a gleaming surface.",

Baroque ornament is shown to advantage in the crisply carved giltwood of this table from Stowe House, Buckinghamshire. The scrolls and shells are similar to designs published by Daniel Marot (1661-1752). The tapering  legs are based on earlier designs for the French king by Pierre Le Pautre (1659-1744).\n\nGilt side table purchased from Phillips of Hitchin\n\nNotes from R.P. 47/1179\n\n23/5/47 letter from Angus Phillips to Edwards\nconfirms that he is holding a gilt side table from Stowe House.\n\n27/5/47 letter from Angus Phillips to Edwards\ngives the particulars of the gilt gesso side table purchased for the V & A.  He bought it from a dealer who acquired it at the sale on 18/19 December 1946 by Messrs. Barry Bros & Bagshaw, Market Place, Kettering; the sale was held at Cranford Hall, Northants by direction of the Executors of the late Major E Grant Thorold.",
