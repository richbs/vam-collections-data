A toilet service included a mirror, candlesticks, brushes, flasks and caskets of different sizes. This one, locked with a key (originally secured to the small ring on the foot) probably contained powder. The maker, Gottlieb Satzger (1709-1783) was the son of the goldsmith Philipp Jakob, and worked in Augsburg. His surviving works are mostly pieces for toilet services, and this is a particularly fine example of his skill. The curving forms, foliage ornament and sinuous, asymmetrical designs based on shell forms are typical of the 'rococo' style that was fashionable in the mid-eighteenth century.",
