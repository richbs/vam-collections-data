The following is the full text of the entry: PIOLA, DOMENICO (1627-1703) 783 Design for a painted and stucco ceiling, with Bacchus and his train revelling on the edge of a circular opening Inscribed in ink in an old hand 'Brusasorzi' Pen and ink and wash 13 x 11 (330 x 280) E\u20224475-1920 PROVENANCE Dr B. Geiger (sale, Sotheby, 9 December, 1920, lot 390, bought by the Museum) The drawing is too late to be by any member of the Brusasorzi family, whose name is written on it. When in Dr Geiger's possession, it was ascribed to Louis Dorigny, which is reasonable chronologically, but still unconvincing. The name Piola was suggested by Bean and Gere independently. The drawing doubtless represents Autumn in a series of the four seasons. It is reminiscent of the ceiling by Piola in the Sala dell' Autunno, Palazzo Rosso, Genoa. In fact the figure of Silenus leaning back with one leg dangling over the edge of the opening appears to be the same as the Silenus in the fresco, in reverse. The drawing, however, shows a smaller and less elaborate ceiling. The fresco is illustrated in O. Grosso, Gli affreschi nei palazzi di Genova, Genoa, 1910, pl. 34. Two drawings, similar to ours, for the ceiling representing Winter in the Palazzo Rosso are illustrated and discussed in E. Malagoli, 'The drawings of Casa Piola' in The Burlington Magazine, 108, 1966, pp. 503-08, figs. 25 and 26. Our sheet is bisected horizontally by a fold. There are several other creases and tears.",
