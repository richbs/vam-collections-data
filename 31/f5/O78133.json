A pattern book is a collection of designs brought together for use as a model or source by artists or craftsmen. This pattern book is anonymous and dates from about 1800.\n\nSubject Depicted\nThis pattern-book page shows a selection of designs for metal handles for commodes (a commode is a piece of furniture which contains drawers or shelves). They are for handles made from stamped brass. To make stamped brass articles, thin sheets of brass were laid on a shaped block, known as a 'die', and hammered on the reverse, so that the design on the die becomes impressed in the brass.\n\nDecorative brass fittings for furniture, such as handles like these, were among the staple products of the Birmingham and London brass founders during the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nPeople\nTadeusz Kosciuszko (1746-1817) played a significant role in the rebellions of two separate nations. During the American War of Independence of 1776-1783, Kosciuszko served with the colonists as both an engineer and a field commander, eventually at the rank of Brigadier-General. He also led the Polish-Lithuanian uprising of 1794, winning several key conflicts before his troops were defeated by vastly superior forces: the combined might of Prussia, Russia and Austria.\n\nThe inclusion of this figure in the pattern book indicates that this English merchandise was aimed at the export market.",

No date.   Water mark :   Britannia and 1801.   From internal evidence it must have been issued after 1793 and before 1815.   In original mottled binding and leather back.\n\n<b>Summary of Contents.</b>\u2014Commode handles, cloak pins, reflecting commode handles, escutcheons, bed caps, metal picture and glass frames and metal borders for rooms.   Prices written in.\n\n<b>Comments.</b>\u2014The water-mark fixes 1801 as the near date of publication, although it should be remembered in this connection that paper was not likely to be used so quickly after making, a hundred years ago as it is to-day.   The goods are stamped brass, and are described in many places as \" finished burnished gold colour.\"   The drawing is excellent, and the decorations embodied in the designs full of interest.   While the list is English, the goods were evidently meant for consumption abroad as well, and the maker had one eye on the French and American markets.   In the then disturbed state of Europe not much manufacturing was in progress there, and the Americans were too young to have developed their resources.   The war fever working in the mind of the draughtsman expressed itself in his graver.   He literally revelled in naval and military emblems, and \" Honor\" and \" Victory\" appear in most unlikely places.   With a fine impartiality he flaunts the red cap or depicts Napoleon conducting in person a spirited bombardment of a castle while troop of cavalry charges wildly up from the background.   The feelings of the Royalist faction were to be appeased with a weeping willow drooping over the tomb of Louis XVI.   Austria is provided for with the double eagle set in a variety of commode handles, cloak pins, and bed caps.   The softer side of life is represented by scenes of childhood after the manner of Greuze and Sir Joshua Reynolds.   Poland is flattered by a portrait of the patriot Thaddeus Ksciuszko.   A portrait of George Washington is another example of the bid for local markets.   <i>See illustration, plate VIII.</i>\"",
