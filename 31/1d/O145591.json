Above and below this is a large inward facing carnation in 'gold' and pink with a pair of 'gold' blossoms and silver buds and leaves curving around the central roundel.\nTo either side of the central stripe is a narrower red ground stripe with a meander linking 5 large blossoms: three 'gold' round blossoms with silver buds and leaves separated by 2 'gold' carnations, all with blue details.\nThe under-drawing can be clearly seen in places.\nThe red satin ground has a red warp and light pink weft.\nThe off-white stripe is delineated by black silk and silver thread.  The pattern changes for 1 cm along a narrow edge [opposite end the Museum Number] where the embroiderer has worked a triangle instead of a small basket-weave motif.  A much wider and more loosely worked combination of black silk and couched silver thread separates the various elements of the border. Across the top and the bottom is a deep band of beige satin with one row of three 'gold' ogees linked with a circle of spiralling 'gold' thread.  Each ogival compartment contains a silver and pink roundel worked to give the impression of a strong circular or spiralling motion plus 6 small circular 'gold' spirals.  The same motifs appear in the  off-set spaces.  Down either side is a smaller version of this design with the ogees containing a solitary silver and pink leaf form.\nEmbroidery thread: black, blue, light blue, 2 shades of pink, green; all 2S silk.\nMetal thread: silver strip close & open S-wound on white S-twist silk\nSilver-gilt strip close and open S-wound on cream Z-twist silk\nFacing: bias cut wove silk.  Three stripes: green and white and purple and white, each with a line of diamonds and edged with yellow and black or yellow and purple blocks and white stripes with a white chevron pattern.\nBacking: pieced; woven silk chevron pattern in dark blue [warp] and light green [weft].",
