It was a deliberate response to the struck medals produced by the state in the previous century. \n\nSpicer Simson was a British sculptor and medallist, who studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Paris, where he was mostly influenced by the sculptor Jean Dampt. His large sculptures are principally  bronze portrait busts. From sculpture he soon moved to medals by which he is best known. He denied the use of the machine when manufacturing medals and that\u2019s why most of his medals are cast works. With this he belonged to a tradition of which Spicer Simson is one of very few early 20th-century exponents. He portrayed many of the eminent British, Irish and American figures of his day.\nHis sitter here - Henri Frantz - was an art critic.",
