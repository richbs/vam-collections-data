The inscriptions in the mosaics by Castellani are often outlined in gold wire, a technique not used on the earlier micromosaics made in Rome in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.  Judy Rudoe has pointed out that in the panel in this bracelet depicting a boat each of the tiny heads is a single tessera (piece of glass) cut from a millefiori cane.",
