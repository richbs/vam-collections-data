            "historical_context_note": "This slab would have been placed in the floor of the church, forming a memorial to the deceased, whose effigy, together with the inscription, is incised on it.  It has been suggested that these leters may be the end of a surname, consisting of the Lombardic capitals A.M. (Ant.J.1934). However, the first letter is not clear and does not appear to be an A of the type usually found in the inscriptions produced in the London workshop.\n\nThe costume that the figure is wearing consists of a loose supertunic with hood over a fitted undergarment., fastened along the forearm by a row of small buttons. This is identical to that found on a continental incised slab of an ecclesiastic in civil dress (ca. 1300) in the Musee d'Histoire et d'Archeologie , Tournai, Belgium (Greenhill 1976, II pl.24a, where it is dated ca.1290). The Tournai slab displays a full hairstyle similar to that on this figure; as the top of the head is missing from the London slab it is possible that it too represents an ecclesiastical figure in civil dress.\n\nThe costume itself is no aid in dating the object, as there was hardly any change in male dress from the end of the thirteenth century to ca.1350 (Greenhill 1976, p.204). However, the style is close to that of brasses of the London workshops, of the first quarter of the century. The facial features and hairstyle are virtually identical to those on the brass commemorating Sir William de Setvans (d.1322) in the Church of St Mary , Chartham , Kent. (London 1987, cat no. 234) This similarity is not surprising as it was the London workshops of Purbeck marblers who expanded their repertoire at the end of the thirteenth and beginning of the fourteenth centuries to exploit the commercial possibilities of monumental brass production  (London 1987 p.171; Greenhill 1076 Vol.I pp.15, 18-19). It has further been suggested that the production of brasses was controlled by marblers throughout the fourteenth century as nearly all brasses made in London during the period were set in Purbeck marble slabs (Coales 1987, pp.170,166).\n\nThe workshop established by Adam de Corfe, the principal dealer in Purbeck marble in London and Westminster, in about 1300 to1310 was most likely responsible for producing the Setvans brass ( London 1987, p.172) It is therefore possible that the incised slab was produced by this or a similar workshop, probably as a cheaper alternative to a monumental brass memorial (Greenhill 1976, I, p.16). The carving technique is nicely illustrated in two French manuscripts of the early fourteenth century (British library Add.MS.10292 fol.55b and MS.Royal 14Eiii, fol.66; Greenhill 1976, I, p.II and pl.I) which show sculptors working with mallet and chisel on effigies and inscriptions.",
