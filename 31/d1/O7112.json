Herman, who came to Britain in 1965, had been involved with the so-called \u2018studio glass\u2019 movement, which emerged in America in the early 1960s. This took glass production out of the factory and into the studio by using small furnaces to melt glass, allowing individuals to work with glass as an artistic medium. Cook founded the glass course at Leicester Polytechnic in 1970 and moved from free-blown hot glass such as this piece, blown on the blow-pipe without the use of moulds, to sand-casting, in which molten glass was poured into a negative mould made of sand.",
