The performances utilise masks and elaborate costume.\n\nThis large, robust mask of Hanakobu-Akujo (Bumpy nosed fierce old man\u2019) is full of character and vitality. The hinoki is necessarily thick to allow for this style of carving. The gilt metal eyes are narrowed and the brows descend over the large nose and angular cheekbones. The nostrils flare over the bristling moustache. The mouth is slightly open to reveal gilt metal teeth and the lower jaw juts out over the long beard. All the lines of the face flow together naturally, yet dramatically, from the furrows of the brow at the top of the mask to the drawn back cheeks. There are two holes through the upper part of the ear for securing silk cords, these holes show some signs of wear on the painted surface.\n\nThe details are painted in an ochre colour over gofun with alternate lines of dark and light ink creating the simplified strands of hair on the head and eyebrows. In keeping with this slightly demonic human character, the furrows on the forehead are highlighted in pale red and the lips are painted a deeper red. The addition of exceptionally long strands of hair for the moustache and beard further add to the overall dramatic effect. \n\nThe inside of the mask has been lacquered in black (originally the interior would have been plain wood) covering over a previous signature which can just be made out in the upper left hand corner. The grain of the wood and the faint chisel marks are just visible under the thick lacquer. The large space in the interior for the nose has ten notches carved at the top and three at the bottom, indicating the work of Echizen Deme, the third of this line (Ref Prof. Yasuo Nakamura). \n\nThe mask typically has tensely furrowed eyebrows which create a large, deeply carved V-shaped crease converge at the top of a prominent nose with a distinctive double bump. Veins run down both sides of the forehead. Tan horse hair implanted below the nose, below the lip, and on the chin surrounds the half-opened mouth baring a large set of gold metal upper teeth; the tip of the tongue is just visible. The facial colouring is a light earthy yellow. This mask is often used instead of the O-Akujo mask for the role of a dragon god who performs a dance in the second act of the plays Shirahige, Oyashiro and Tamano: original mask attributed to Suminobu.",
