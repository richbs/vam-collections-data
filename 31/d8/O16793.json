In August 1954, American Vogue magazine announced that 'this Autumn without question the smart woman's place is in tweed'. This stylish outfit was worn by Mrs Opal Holt. The designer stated that he intended it to be worn over a discreetly checked blouse at the races. Mrs Holt's extensive wardrobe of fashionable dress donated to the Museum ranges from the 1930s to the 1970s. Over 100 items - day and evening wear together with accessories - represent her acquired taste. Mrs Holt bought her clothes in London, Paris and New York, and the collection features works by many famous designers, including Dior, Balenciaga and Givenchy.",
