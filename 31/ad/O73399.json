Having established his reputation by documenting the Crimean war in 1854, he was instructed to sketch well-known sites in and around Delhi associated with the heavy fighting of 1857.\n\nSimpson arrived in Calcutta (Kolkata) in 1859 and travelled widely. His rapid pencil drawings formed the preparatory studies for his finished watercolours which were done after his return to London in 1862. His fond memories of India, as noted in his journal, resulted in these highly coloured, evocative and romantic interpretations of the Indian landscape.\n\nDuring Simpson's first Himalayan tour he travelled to Chini, 10,000 feet above the Sutlej valley. The journey involved crossing the Sutlej River by a rope bridge. The precarious nature of the bridge and the fierce current of the river instilled both curiosity and fear in the Europeans who saw it. Simpson captures the drama of the scene, with one figure hanging on the bridge and the awe-inspiring mountains in the background.",

            "history_note": "Historical significance: William Simpson (1823 - 1899)\n\nWilliam Simpson was commissioned to go to India by his employers, Day and Sons, the London lithography firm. Having established his reputation by documenting the Crimean war in 1854, he was instructed to sketch well-known sites in and around Delhi associated with the heavy fighting of 1857.\n\nSimpson arrived in Calcutta (Kolkata) in 1859 and travelled widely. His rapid pencil drawings formed the preparatory studies for his finished watercolours which were done after his return to London in 1862. His fond memories of India, as noted in his journal, resulted in these highly coloured, evocative and romantic interpretations of the Indian landscape.\n\nSimpson, a largely self-taught artist from a poor family in Scotland, had hoped to achieve fame on the publication of his paintings in a lavishly illustrated volume. Unfortunately, financial problems led to the poorly printed India Ancient and Modern containing only fifty images. Simpson called it the \u2018big disaster\u2019 of his life. \n\nThe V&A has the single most important collection of watercolours made during Simpson's first expedition to India.",
