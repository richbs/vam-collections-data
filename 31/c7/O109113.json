The function of a monstrance is to display the Sacred Host, the bread that is miraculously transformed into the body of Christ during the service of Mass. The Host would have been placed inside the window in a crescent-shaped holder called a 'lunula' (now missing from this example).\n\nMonstrances were placed on the altar as a focus for worship during the service of Benediction, or held up during church processions for all the congregation to see. In Spain, during the annual feast of Corpus Christi (meaning 'body of Christ'), a monstrance was often placed inside a huge architectural canopy called a custodia and paraded around the parish.\n\nThis monstrance is in the shape of a sun, symbolising Christ\u2019s regeneration and radiance. Its design is a late example of a style of Spanish goldsmiths' work inspired by the restrained architecture of Juan Herrera, who worked on the Escorial Palace near Madrid for Philip II of Spain from the 1570s. Metalwork of the period echoed his clean, architectural lines. On earlier Herreran pieces goldsmiths would have applied enamel bosses and gems, but here the goldsmith has used rectangular faceted bosses and cherub heads. The surfaces are elaborately pounced (pricked) with scrolling ornament.",

Money and labour were lavished on religious art and images played a central role in daily worship. To ensure that goldsmiths focused on work for the crown and the church, the authorities brought in a series of sumptuary laws that limited the secular display of gems and precious metals. \n\nBy 1550 the silver mines in Peru and Mexico were generating enormous wealth for Spain and feeding the traditional taste for massive silver forms. They included the custodia, a towering architectural canopy that was unique to Spain. It was paraded through parishes during the Corpus Christi festival to display the Sacred Host (consecrated bread). The custodia embodied many characteristics of Spanish church plate. It was sculptural, highly visible and richly imaginative in design. \n\nWith the Counter Reformation, Spain became a triumphant defender of a revitalised Catholic faith. Silver altar vessels and entire altars, processional crosses, custodias and sanctuary lamps frequently appeared in goldsmiths' contracts.",
