By exploring surface treatments and textures they created an effect very different from the bright metallic glint of polished gold. The jewellers restored an elemental simplicity and grandeur to this most enduring of metals. Yasuki Hiramatsu's strong forms of crumpled gold foil reveal the inherent softness of the metal.\n\nHiramatsu came from a family of metalworkers and is considered to be the first contemporary artist jeweller in Japan. He used traditional Japanese goldsmithing techniques, yet transformed these into modern vessels and jewellery with Western principles. The gold is thinly rolled almost paper-thin, then folded, crumpled, pounded or beaten to create highly textured surfaces. For Hiramatsu it was important how the light would fall and enhance the surfaces. His work is however characterized by its simplicity.",
