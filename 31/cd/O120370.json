Born into a Jewish family in Frankfurt, she initially pursued an academic career before moving to Paris in 1930 to concentrate on photography. In Paris, she carried out commissions for magazines and took portraits, as well as concentrating on her own work, modernist views of the city. She emigrated to New York in 1941 and remained there after the war. Bing remarked on a stylistic change that had occured since the 1930s, attributing it to the war and her sense of isolation that developed in the States where she was an anonymous \u00e9migr\u00e9. She felt that she was \u2018in a vacuum\u2026looking out from the world as if from a space capsule\u2019. This photograph shows Bing's concentration and perhaps reveals a sense of  isolation and sadness at current events, and her situation.",
