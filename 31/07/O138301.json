Tables of this form were often used as dressing tables, with three small drawers for convenience, and perhaps a small dressing mirror placed upon it. On this example the need for stretchers between the legs to give stability made it less convenient to use sitting down. During the 18th century, similar tables were made without stretchers, using mahogany with strongly glued joints. Since the late 19th century this type of table, with deep drawers in front, has been known as a 'lowboy'.\n\nOn loan to the Elizabethan House, Plymouth.",
