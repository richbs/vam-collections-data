This decorative style continues into the Ayyubid and Mamluk period, demonstrated by the V&A carved wooden tiles (391-1884) from the minbar of the mosque of Ibn Tulun, dated 1297-8.  The technique is also found in other media, such as stone, e.g. the V&A marble basin (335-1903), dated 1277.\n\nThere are two comparable plaques in the Louvre, four in Berlin and six in the Bargello Museum in Florence.",
