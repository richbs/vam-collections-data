            "public_access_description": "This fine Baroque reliquary is testimony to the Catholic cult of relics in early eighteenth-century Italy. The most precious materials, Corsican jasper, chalcedony, gilt-bronze and parcel-gilt silver were used to create a magnificent repository for a sacred object which is only partly visible behind a glass screen. The handwritten inscription identifies the wooden fragment in this reliquary as a piece from the crib of Christ. Another example of presumed relics from the manger in which the Infant Christ was laid after his birth are five fragments of wood preserved at Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome. \n\nForm \n\nThe form of this reliquary is based upon contemporary designs of monstrances, which were used to display the Host to the congregation during mass. It clearly reflects the intention of an object that is equally magnificent when seen from a distance as from close-up: A silver relief of the Nativity serves as illustration to the nature of the relic, and can only be appreciated from nearby, whereas the sparkling silver and gold would be visible from far away.\n\nStyle \n\nThe design of this reliquary is in the manner of Orazio Scoppa. In 1642-1643 Scoppa published a series of eighteen designs for silver objects which he dedicated to Melchiorre Borgia. One of these prints shows a monstrance with comparable overall form and figurative decoration of heads of cherubs and garlands of flowers. Joseph Strutt described Scoppa's work as \"in a very spirited style\"  in the second volume of his Biographical Dictionary of Engravers from 1786 (p. 313). \n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes. Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
