From July to December 1866, he toured part of the Himalayan region. He wrote about his journey in The British Journal of Photography, outlining his route and in some cases describing the scenes he photographed.\n\nBourne found the Baspa Valley and surrounding area particularly beautiful. This view includes the village of Sungla. He wrote: 'The Buspa Valley is celebrated for its beauty and its shooting grounds; my interest lay only in the former, and the part about Sungla was certainly very fine. Groves of walnut trees clustered thick on each bank of the Buspa, which meandered peacefully through the valley: above these, far up the hillsides, flourished the pine and the sturdy deodar \u2013 the whole shut in by lofty mountains\u2026. There was a delightful freshness and beauty about the whole, after the barren and wild scenes through which I had lately passed. I spent three very pleasant days taking views about the valley, and left Sungla with reluctance.\u2019",

Below is the relevant section for this photograph: \n\n'The Buspa Valley is celebrated for its beauty and its shooting grounds; my interest lay only in the former, and the part about Sungla was certainly very fine. Groves of walnut trees clustered thick on each bank of the Buspa, which meandered peacefully through the valley; above these, far up the hillsides, flourished the pine and the sturdy deodar \u2013 the whole shut in by lofty mountains, which on the north side often terminated in sharp \u2013pointed peaks, while those on the south were generally covered with verdure and forest. There was a delightful freshness and beauty about the whole, after the barren and wild scenes through which I had lately passed. I spent three very pleasant days taking views about the valley, and left Sungla with reluctance'.\n\nBourne, S, A Photographic journey through the Higher Himalayas, The British Journal of Photography, March  4, 1870, pg 98.",
