The plate was etched in such a way that the resultant print looks like a crayon drawing.\n\nThis print originally formed the title-page of a small book entitled A New Book of Ornaments, by the carver Thomas Johnson (born 1714; died after 1778). This small pattern book contained six sheets of Rococo designs for chimney-piece friezes and tablets. The title can be seen inscribed on the right-hand portion of the ruined wall.\n\nPeople\nJohnson, the publisher of this plate, was a furniture designer and carver. In addition, he taught drawing and modelling and issued several pattern books. On this title-page he has described A New Book of Ornaments as 'Useful for Youth to draw after'. He clearly intended his book for use by apprentices or young carvers, to help them learn the basics of Rococo design.\n\nSubject Depicted\nJohnson has included various Rococo motifs on this title-page, including the picturesquely ruined wall, the rustic scene with the herdsman and his cows, and the asymmetrical 'rocaille' (rockwork) cartouche that encloses the image.",
