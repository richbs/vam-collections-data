            "public_access_description": "The ruched skirt and draperies on this dress reverberate with intense colour, revealing the fashion for bright new synthetic dyes. Their inception owes much to the work of Sir William Henry Perkin (1838-1907), who discovered the first famous artificial colour by accident in 1856 when he was a student at the Royal College of  Chemistry in London. While experimenting with a synthetic formula to replace the natural anti-malarial drug quinine, he produced a reddish powder instead of the colourless quinine. To better understand the reaction he tested the procedure using aniline and created a crude black product that \u2018when purified, dried and digested with spirits of wine gave a mauve dye\u2019. This dye created a beautiful lustrous colour that Perkin patented and which became known as \u2018aniline violet\u2019 or \u2018mauveine\u2019. \n\nPerkin\u2019s discovery led to a revolution in synthetic colour from the late 1850s onwards. Textile manufacturers soon turned to his aniline process and the resulting fabrics were characterised by an unprecedented brilliance and intensity that delighted the consumer. Women\u2019s dresses acted as a perfect advertisement for these rich hues, especially as trimmings usually matched the colour of the gown. In August 1859 the satirical journal \u2018Punch\u2019 described the craze for purple as \u2018Mauve Measles\u2019, a disease which erupted in a \u2018measly rash of ribbons\u2019 and ended with the entire body covered in mauve. Soon other synthetic dyes were being produced with evocative names such as \u2018acid magenta\u2019, \u2018aldehyde green\u2019, \u2018Verguin\u2019s fuchine\u2019, \u2018Martius yellow\u2019 and Magdela red\u2019 to match their gaudy appearance. This dress is coloured with a chemical dye which closely resembles the aniline violet and purple fabric samples dyed with Perkin and Sons Colors shown in the \u2018Practical Mechanics Journal: Record of the Great Exhibition\u2019, 1862.",

However, there may be a misunderstanding where this provenance is concerned, as Geraldine Hervey's own wedding was 4 March 1862; her mothers' was 30 November 1830. The information is from a letter of the donor to the Museum. While the dresses certainly could have been part of a family trousseau, it would not have been that of the Marchioness nor her mother's.",
