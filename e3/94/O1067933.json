Full Citation: \n \n\"<b>44 Unknown Man</b>\n<b>1625-30</b> \nP5-1950 \n<b>Ova1 39 x 31 mm</b> \n\nFeatures in very fine blended strokes of brown and sanguine, with touches of grey in the shadows, and with black with white spots in the eyes, on a pale creamy carnation ground; hair in brown wash, lined with darker colour and with ochre lights; collar in white over pale grey wash; armour in dark grey wash, modelled in black with lights in pale grey and ochre for the studs; costume in red, grey and ochre on a yellow wash; landscape background washed and hatched in opaque browns, blues and greys over the vellum; on vellum put down on pasteboard (a playing card with parts of five diamonds).  \n \n<b>Condition:</b> A scratch with darkened retouch in sitter's cheek; rubs and abrasions; basically sound.  \n \n<b>Signed:</b> In black centre left: <i>DDG</i>.  \n \n<b>Frame:</b> Late nineteenth-century copper-gilt locket with push-fit rounded front forming a rebate to hold the slightly convex glass; slightly convex back held in straight sides edged with continuous round wire, twisted at the top to form the hanger.  \n \n<b>Provenance:</b> Not recorded before the dealer H E Backer, from whom purchased January 1950 with funds from the R H Stephenson Bequest.  \n \n<b>Literature:</b> Reynolds 1952, pl.XI (30); <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p.15; Murdoch 1981, pp.136-7, fig. 148; Reynolds 1988, p.66, fig. 34. \n\nWith Cat. No. 45 [P.95-1937], this provides the best indication of Des Granges' early style. On costume it dates from c.1625. (1) The collar is analogous to that worn by Sir Kenelm Digby in the Peter Oliver portrait of 1627.(2) But the costume would be possible for c.1630, which is more comfortable in relation to Des Granges' age at that time and the level of competence visible in the painting. Compared with Cat. No. 45, the face is very little faded and is finely worked in red and brown in fairly long strokes that tend to follow the curves and contours of the features. As observed in Murdoch 1981, 'relief is created by tonal shading in grey, the colour applied in very short, almost stippled strokes making an effect of considerable softness and subtlety. The rest of the miniature follows the normal professional practice of the period: the hair worked from a pale wash to the darker tones and finally heightened with the appropriate opaque colour for the lights; the collar similarly brought up from the basic pale grey wash with pure white lights and lace detail. For the studs in the armour Des Granges adopted the \"advanced\" painterly method of representation, with ochre paint rather than powdered gold, but it is clear from the <i>A Woman with the initials MB</i> that he knew the techniques of using powdered metal, in this case the use of silver for the pearls. In both these miniatures the technique is basically orthodox, recognisably part of the Hilliard/Oliver/Hoskins tradition, but, like that tradition, capable of innovation and individuality clearly on both the biographical and stylistic evidence, Des Granges belonged in this tradition with Hoskins as his main point of attachment. Apart from the technical minutiae, it is Hoskins' work that Des Granges' most resembles in general, being distinctly similar to the <i>Lady Catherine Erskine</i> (3) of about the same date, and the <i>Unknown Man</i> [the present miniature] in using a landscape for the background, as early an example of this as anything in the main Hoskins oeuvre.'
