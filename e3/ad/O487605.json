To prepare the ink some water would have been applied to the well at the end of ink stone by the water dropper. The ink stick would then be carefully dipped in the water and then slowly but firmly ground against the rough edge of the ink stone. Seen as a careful and meditative process, ink preparation took a while and was finished only when the consistency of the ink reached the desired thickness. This left ample time for the individual to admire the box. \nThe interior of the box is decorated with a common countryside motif of rice sheaves hung up to dry. Although sewn and harvested by peasants rice was only eaten by city dwellers who could afford the crop. For poorer citizens millet was eaten instead of rice. \nThe exterior of the box is decorated in silver and gold kirikane (square pieces of gold foil) to achieve an almost monochromatic effect. The mosaic design around the sides and lid of the box is created through relatively large pieces of gold and silver individually applied to the black lacquer background. The depiction of water plants has been a common motif since the Momoyama period (1573-1615).",
