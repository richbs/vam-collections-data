            "physical_description": "A head cap of woven silk and linen, padded with wool. The skull cap area is made of an upper layer of silk. The silk is of different fabrics. One half (half of this is missing) seems to be plain woven blue. The other half (most is missing) appears to have been a pattern weave in blue, brown and buff. The pattern weave has warps of brown silk; one stripe is mainly buff with thin, dark brown lines; the other stripe is dark blue; the stripes alternate. The plain blue weave probably covered the front part of the cap with the striped fabric covering the back. The next layer was a padding of undyed wool, approx. 4mm thick. The inner layer is of undyed, plain woven linen; approx 14x14 tpc. The layers are quilted together with a poorly dyed blue, linen thread.  The skull cap is made of what was probably two halves sewn at the centre. The linen lining does not meet at the centre line. two lines of thread (running stitch) is sewn on either side of the centre and the quilted lines run in semi-circles around the centre. \n\nThe  skull cap is sewn (whip stitch) to a head band, approx. 38mm wide. At the top and bottom of the head band is a thick, twirled line of wool sewn around the edge. These thicker lines are also sewn into the headband in a criss-cross pattern to form a raised pattern. The head band is covered in a plain woven, blue threaded silk fabric and has the woollen, patterned middle layer and an inner layer of undyed, plain woven linen [approx. 13x16 tpc (sys 1 x sys 2)]. On the inside the running stitches used to sew around the woollen wads is clearly visible. \n\nThe head cap has holes and staining.",

            "public_access_description": "A head cap of woven silk and linen, padded with wool. Egyptian, ca. AD1000-1400. From a tomb. The skull cap area is made of an upper layer of silk. The silk is of different fabrics. One half (half of this is missing) seems to be plain woven blue. The other half (most is missing) appears to have been a pattern weave in blue, brown and buff. The pattern weave has warps of brown silk; one stripe is mainly buff with thin, dark brown lines; the other stripe is dark blue; the stripes alternate. The plain blue weave probably covered the front part of the cap with the striped fabric covering the back. The next layer was a padding of undyed wool, approx. 4mm thick. The inner layer is of undyed, plain woven linen; approx 14x14 tpc. The layers are quilted together with a poorly dyed blue, linen thread.  The skull cap is made of what was probably two halves sewn at the centre. The linen lining does not meet at the centre line. two lines of thread (running stitch) is sewn on either side of the centre and the quilted lines run in semi-circles around the centre. \n\nThe  skull cap is sewn (whip stitch) to a head band, approx. 38mm wide. At the top and bottom of the head band is a thick, twirled line of wool sewn around the edge. These thicker lines are also sewn into the headband in a criss-cross pattern to form a raised pattern. The head band is covered in a plain woven, blue threaded silk fabric and has the woollen, patterned middle layer and an inner layer of undyed, plain woven linen [approx. 13x16 tpc (sys 1 x sys 2)]. On the inside the running stitches used to sew around the woollen wads is clearly visible. \n\nThe head cap has holes and staining.",
