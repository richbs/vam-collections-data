The original length runs from one selvedge to the other and was therefore cut across the width of the cotton fabric. The correct order of the four pieces from the top is: 849C-1875, 849A-1875, 849-1875, 849B-1875. This illustrates how such pieces were laid out and worked: there is no underdrawing and the diagonal lines, which are worked first, are not evenly spaced.  One colour is worked first, and the second is added.  Then the brackets are worked - again, these are not evenly spaced. Then the outlines of the flowers are worked.\n\nThere is a selvedge along the top and bottom has been cut.  There is a narrow line of green stitching across the top and down either side.  \nThere is a series of chevron stripes running from lower right to upper left.  These have been worked in pink and green silk; in the lower left hand side only the green has been worked.\n\nThreads: green, pink, silk; 2S",
