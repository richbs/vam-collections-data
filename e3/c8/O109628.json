They are also known as a hookah, huqqa, qalian, qalyan, qaliyan, narghile, shisha, and a hubble-bubble.\n\nIt was made in Iran during the reign of the Safavid dynasty (1501-1722). At this time potters often used single colour glazes to great effect, frequently decorating them with coloured slips (liquid clay) under the glaze.  Alternatively they sometimes carved the slip away to reveal the white body beneath. In other cases, as here, they added designs in white and other slips.",
