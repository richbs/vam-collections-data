At the upper edge is a vignette of a half naked child climbing through fruiting trees, above the verse 'Jesus permit thy gracious name to stand'; at the lower edge is a scene of a young shepherd boy sitting beneath a tree by a church with his dog and sheep, while he plays the bagpipes.  The embroiderer's details and the date are worked within an oblong panel at the lower edge.",

During the nineteenth century religious proverbs and sayings were much favoured by the churches, and those which used a rhyme or a play on words were easily communicated and remembered.\n\n'Jesus permit thy gracious name to stand' is by far the most commonly found verse on samplers in the English-speaking world. It is known to have been in use from at least 1809.  Authorship is attributed by some to the hymn-writer John Newton (1725-1807), best known for 'Amazing Grace', who is said to have written it for the sampler of his niece Elizabeth Catlett.  It has also been suggested that it was composed by the writer Isaac Watts (1674-1748) for his niece, but if this were so, it is surprising that there are no eighteenth century examples known when Watts's verses were so much used on samplers.  Some admirers of the poet Emily Dickinson (1830-86) have suggested that she composed it because she embroidered it on her sampler, but it had already been in use for several decades by the time she was born.",
