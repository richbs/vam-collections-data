In this letter dated 22 June 1901, Shorose writes to Smith, now returned to Kidderminster, England. As well as gossiping about their common acquaintances in the carpet business community around Sultanabad, and asking after Smith's sister Jane, Shorose provides an update as to Smith's private effects left behind, which Shorose had undertaken to ship back to England, or to sell on his colleague's behalf.\n\nThe C.R. Smith archive consists of an album of 60 mounted albumen prints (predominantly portraits and topographical views, taken in Iran and Iraq), a further 24 loose photographs, and a series of letters and memos. \n\nThese document a correspondence between Charles R. Smith (born 1866) and various colleagues made throughout 1901, when Smith was approached to join a new carpet enterprise in Tabriz. He duly left Sultanabad where he had been working for the Persian Carpet Manufacturing Company, but by July of the same year he had returned to his native Kidderminster in England. It is not known if the Tabriz business plan was ever realised.",
