The text reads as follows: ZUCCARO, FEDERICO (c. 1540-1609) 419 Harpocrates (or Horus), god of silence Inscribed in ink by the younger or elder Jonathan Richardson \u2018h. 36\u2019 Pen and ink and wash heightened with white; circular 8 \u00bd (216) diameter 8091.2 PROVENANCE Padre Resta; lord Somers (the inscription refers to a ms. In the British Museum which is a transcript of Resta\u2019s notes on the drawings first in his and then in Lord Somer\u2019s collection; see Popham, Resta; also Lugt 2981 and Lugt, Supplement, p. 419); bought 18768 LITERATURE J. A. Gere, Taddeo Zuccaro. His development studied in his drawings, 1969, p. 116 and p. 169, no. 114 There is a corresponding picture in the Sala di Aurora in the Farnese Palace at Caprarola. For the short account of the paintings there, see under no. 418, a companion drawing. Both drawings were attributed to Taddeo by Resta and connected with Caprarola. He correctly described the figure in no. 419 as \u2018nume del Silenzio\u2019, but the name of the god is illegible. Caro, as quoted by Vasari, calls him Arpocrate and asks the painter to represent him \u2018col ditto alla bocca, in atto di domandare che si taccia\u2019. Gere attributes the drawing to Federico. There is another version of the design in the Albertina (Albertina Catalogue, I, no. 216, as by Ligozzi).",
