It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre. He compiled them in a series of albums.\n\nMurray established a company of juvenile performers called \u2018The Casey\u2019s Circus and Casey\u2019s Court Nibbs\u2019, in which he appeared as the redoubtable Mrs Casey. The entertainment occupied most of the second half of the bill at Hanley. It was billed as \u2018a screamingly funny eccentric act\u2019 concerning a street urchin trying to produce a circus. A review of the performance noted that \u2018while its humour is in progress of development, everyone is highly entertained\u2019. Among the members of Murray\u2019s company at various times were his son Roy Leo, his grandson Roy junior, Tommy Trinder and the young Charles Chaplin. Charlie Chaplin later described it as \u2018an awful show\u2019.",

A Performance conceived in the true spirit of Burlesque.  Its sheer absurdity moves one to laughter,' Murray established a company of juvenile performers called' The Casey's Circus and Casey's Court Nibbs', in which he appeared as the redoubtable Mrs Casey.  The company performed as a music hall act and among the members of his company were his son Roy Leo, his grandson Roy junior, Tommy Trinder, and the young Charles Chaplin who later described their performance as 'an awful show'. The caricature comes from the second album of caricatures in a collection of albums owned by the Theatre Museum compiled by the graphic artist George Cooke.  It is labelled by the artist 'Geo Cooke HYS BOOKE' and features music hall performers working in the early 20th century.",
