It is also known that William Killigrew, a soldier and minor courtier, hired German potters called Simon Wooltus (father and son) to make stoneware at Southampton: surviving pieces are dated 1672 and 1674. Dwight, however, submitted his successful 1672 patent application two weeks before Killigrew.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThis bottle clearly demonstrates the difficulties of making salt-glazed stoneware before supplies of suitable clays and methods of firing were established. The glaze is so thick that when it was exhibited at the Society of Antiquaries in 1894 it was described as lead-glazed. The applied moulded medallion and mask also display an inexperienced technique.",
