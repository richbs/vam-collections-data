            "public_access_description": "Sandra Fisher's work is most interesting for its treatment of subject - specifically the role reversal of male artist/female model to female artist/male model, and her portrayal of women friends. Generally based on the 'studio portrait' or 'life study', her figures are imbued with a warm, domestic intimacy.\n\nThis portrait of a friend bathing is obviously derived from Bonnard, but whereas we are aware of the obsessive compulsion of  Bonnard to view his model/wife through the colour-and-light-transforming medium of water, Fisher has taken up the now famous intimacy of the pose to speak of her own very different and relaxed relationship with female friends. The point is made all the more strongly by using the familiar icon as a point of departure. This is neither an obsessed male view or a lesbian homosexual one, but rather more unusually, but signicantly in terms of feminist history, simply one of recording a friend enjoying herself in a very private and intimate way.",
