His proficiency was such that his father, William Bidder, a stonemason, exhibited him as a \"calculating boy\", first in local fairs up to the age of six, and later around the country. After funds were raised to provide him with a formal education Bidder went on to become a prominent and successful engineer. He is now best remembered as a leading engineer and architect.",
