The pattern has been created by folding the cloth from corner to corner like a concertina and then binding it very tightly at various points.  It would then have been dyed in large earthenware dye pots partially sunk into the ground.  Both the tying and the dyeing would have been done by women.\n\nAdire was generally used by women as wraparound skirts but during the 1960s it was also made into tailored items such as men\u2019s shirts.   Adire was extremely popular in the 1960s partly because they were inexpensive and could be made quickly in response to changing fashions.  Patterns would fall in and out of favour; this particular cloth was referred to by the woman who bought it for the museum as \u2018cloth of the year\u2019 in 1964 because it was so popular.",
