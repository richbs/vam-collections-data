            "public_access_description": "This medallion is made by Andrea della Robbia (1435-1525), in Florence in the late 15th or early 16th century.\n\nThis is a beautiful version of the similar tondo formerly in the Foulc collection in Paris, now in the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The types of the Virgin and Child are closely related to paintings by Domenico Ghirlandaio.\n\nThe Della Robbia family was an Italian family of sculptors and potters. They were active in Florence from the early 15th century and elsewhere in Italy and France well into the 16th. Family members were traditionally employed in the textile industry, and their name derives from rubia tinctorum, a red dye. \n\nAndrea was the nephew of Luca della Robbia, who founded the workshop and invented the technique of enamelled terracotta.\nThis technique is about evenly applying pigment suspended in tin-oxide glaze to the fired terracotta before refiring. The pallet was restricted and it was eg. not possible to reproduce flesh-tones, so these areas have been left unglazed, and would have been painted instead to create a more natural effect.\nAndrea della Robbia, who inherited the workshop, tended to use more complex compositions and polychrome glazing rather than the simple blue-and-white schemes favoured by his uncle.\nTrained as a marble sculptor in the studio of his uncle Luca, Andrea della Robbia also became an excellent modeller, unrivalled in his ability to capture the life of his subjects in glazed clay. His best-known works are 10 roundels of infants on the fa\u00e7ade of Florence's Foundling Hospital (about 1487).",
