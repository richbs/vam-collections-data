(They had previously worn stockings but socks were easier to keep in place beneath a trouser leg.)  By the 1840s they were being made with ribbed cuffs, so that they did not fall down. Men's socks were usually made of cotton, merino or silk.\n\nOwnership & Use\nThese socks would have been worn during the day or evening and would have added a touch of colour to the owner's dress. Although black was a fashionable colour for socks, brighter colours were also worn, such as scarlet, bright blue and green. The writer  Lytton Strachey is shown wearing olive green socks with a grey suit and a green tie in a portrait of 1904 by Simon Bussy.\n\nTrading\nTechnological improvements led to a great expansion in the stocking-making industry after 1850. This meant that socks could be manufactured in greater numbers.  I. & R. Morley Ltd. was probably the largest firm in the 1890s, employing thousands of workers and with factories and warehouses in London and the provinces.  By this time the company was producing knitted underwear and sports garments as well as socks and stockings.",
