            "physical_description": "Plain weave cotton quilted with silk, padded with cotton thread, with needlelace insertions, backed with plain weave block printed cotton and faced with woven silk.\nThere are three separate sections [two borders and the central panel] joined together with a needlelace insertion.  The central panel is pieced, with a seam across its width, going across the roundel.\nSilk worked in back stitch or double running forms very narrow channels, along most of which an indigo-dyed cotton thread has been inserted.  Small areas of the ground remain unquilted, often forming small leaves.  Small pointed ovals form details, each containing an eyelet hole. These can look a little like snake's head.\nOutermost Border: band of blue and white diagonal lines.\nOuter Border: a row along the top and bottom of stylized floral sprays, one with a base pair of blue leaves alternating with a larger one with white leaves and a central diamond. There is a square in each corner with an outward pointing diagonal line with a diamond-shaped blossom and a central pair of long thin leaves. Up the sides the pattern becomes a repeating pattern of a pair of unquilted leaves with a diamond above, 2 pairs of 'snake heads' and 3 large lozenge-shaped blossoms. There is a narrow border of chevrons, then the insertion, then a repeat of this narrow border.\nInner Border: the pattern along the top and bottom of the inner border is a cypress tree within a lozenge alternating with 2 lozenge-shaped blossoms, one above the other.  At the ends the cypress tree is replaced with one, or two partial, lozenges. In the side borders the pattern repeats the cypress with the lozenge and the lozenge-shaped blossoms are to either side of the base of the cypress. There is a square in each corner which is the same design as those in the outer border. There is a narrow inner border with reciprocal undulations in blue or white, followed by an insertion.\nThe central panel contains an arch-shape created by a band of horizontal lines which turn into leaf-shapes along the upper  right hand side. The arch contains a roundel with a 7 pointed star.  Immediately below the roundel is a small, round blossom with pointed petals at the top of a narrow stem which goes down to the base of the central panel.  Similar blossoms branch off the stem and mingle with groups of 4 snake heads and lozenges.  To either side of these is a line of lozenges, slightly wavy V-shaped petals and snake heads.  The spandrels are filled with more of the pointed-petalled flowers, lozenges and v-shaped leaves.\nCotton thread: Z-spun\nEmbroidery Thread: white silk; 2S\n\nBacking: white cotton ground with parallel meandering stems of red, red and blue, and red and purple flowers with some blue flowers and small purple flowers and dark green leaves.  Along the lower end is part of a printed border with a yellow ground and a fine meander of red and purple flowers and blue leaves.\nFacing: bias-cut, striped silk: light blue stripe alternating with a pink stripe with chevrons and 2 yellows stripes with chevrons.",
