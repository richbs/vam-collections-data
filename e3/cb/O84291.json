Sugimoto records the ambient light created by the cinema screen.  The drama of the light effect is balanced by the 'neutrality' of the camera position, always directly facing the screen.  \n                \nThe gelatin-silver process is the most common means of making black and white prints from negatives. They are made from papers coated with a layer of gelatin which contains light sensitive silver salts. They were developed in the 1870s and by 1895 had generally replaced albumen prints because they were more stable, did not turn yellow and were simpler to produce. Gelatin-silver prints remain the standard black and white print type.",
