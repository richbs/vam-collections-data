She differed from most fond parental snapshot photographers, however, in devoting a floor of her house to photography - notice the bare boards of her studio. She employed a variety of cameras and formats, and used a highly complicated but up-to-date process (the wet collodion on glass negative). All this shows that she photographed very deliberately. She also exhibited the results at the Photographic Society of London, one of the most prestigious institutions of the day. Thus, this photograph has the attractions of a snapshot but it is taken to a higher than usual level of achievement.",
