This German example made from pearwood would have been used to stamp gingerbread before baking, or to impress jellies, to create delicious novelties. The Agnus Dei, or Lamb of God, was a popular Christian motif to remind worshippers of Christ's role as their sacrificial lamb. The image would also remind the meek that they might eventually triumph and ascend to heaven despite their unfavourable eartly situation. This object is a good example of folk art, and is charmingly engraved, a feeling made stronger by the reversed aspect of the date, 1795, on any imprints made by the mould.",
