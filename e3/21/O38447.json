The certificate is rectangular, of portrait proportions, and\n shows a large illustration of Christ in pink and blue robes, giving\n Communion to a dark-haired boy in a grey suit and a fair-haired girl\n wearing a white dress and wreath of white roses.  Beneath this are two\n smaller scenes of landscape proportions, rendered en grisaille: on the\n right the symbolism of the Last Supper, with Christ giving Communion\n to his apostles (led by St John the Evangelist); on the left, the Old\n Testament scene which is held to have prefigured it, when Melchizedek\n the high priest and King of Salem offered bread and wine to the\n victorious Abraham and his men after they returned from battle\n (Genesis Ch 14).  All three illustrations are enclosed within a\n geometric border of old gold with blue and black.  Beneath is printed\n and inscribed\n           \"SOUVENIR OF FIRST COMMUNION\nDenis Delay\nreceived his First Communion on Maunday Thursday 1934\nBaptised        Confirmed\n   (signed) Joseph Reardon    Priest",
