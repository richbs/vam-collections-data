The putti (small cherubs), a vase, and scrolling foliage are motifs looking back to the art and design of ancient Rome and are characteristic of Italian Renaissance art.\n\nThis print is very small - less than three centimetres high and eight centimetres long but even in such a small space the artist has created an image full of energy and a sense of movement. One putto is looking down so we only see the top of his head while the body of the other is seen more in profile although his face is obscured by his arm. Both of them are standing on one foot suggesting a dance or a pose that will only be held for a short time. Variety within an overall symmetrical composition is carried through to the scrolling foliage at either end, as the left and right halves do not match. The grid-like black background gives this print the appearance of a sculptural low relief.",
