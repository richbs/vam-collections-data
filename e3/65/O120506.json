Other devotees and animals are shown in a landscape taking up three quarters of the painting. The animals are reminiscent of those depicted in Mewar books of dreams, but the inscription seems to suggest an invocation to Vishnu as the creator of all things, and this may be what is symbolised by the various animals and vegetation. The pale, stippled technique used in this painting enjoyed a vogue at Amar Singh's court around 1705.",

Other devotees and animals are shown in a landscape setting which takes up most of the picture.The inscription praises Vishnu and all the animals and natural things he has created, so it is likely that this painting is an invocation of Vishnu as the creator of all things.\nThe pale colours and stippled technique used in the painting enjoyed a vogue at Amar Singh's court around 1705.",
