The glass makers carefully ground and polished two glass cups, so that the inner cup would fit exactly into the outer. They covered the outside of the inner cup with gold leaf, which they then engraved using a metal point with a design. The inner cup was gilded on the outside then painted over with marbling. After decoration, the glass maker would carefully fit the two cups together and seal them at the top to make them waterproof and fit for use. This technique was probably first used in Dresden, but was soon taken up in Bohemian where most surviving glasses have been made. The most popular decoration were the type of hunting scenes we can see on this covered goblet.",
