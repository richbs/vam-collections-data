The whole is cast in two halves down the length and held with tongue and slot jointing. The clockwork is housed in the body covered with a metal plate cut away at the corners to allow the legs to move. The key is integral attached underneath. When wound the back legs collapse then spring open and the horse appears to leap along. It has an erratic movement. This type of mechanical horse was developed by G\u00fcnthermann and it is probably one of them but appears unmarked. The horse is pre-1914.",
