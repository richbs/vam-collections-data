This American silk programme is a superbly produced example, folded to make four pages, and featuring several finely engraved images, as well as advertisements, articles, riddles, and information about the theatre season, so that it is more like a theatre magazine than a programme. It was produced for The Foresters by Lord Tennyson, at Daly's Theatre on Broadway, New York, 17 March 1892, with incidental music by Sir Arthur Sullivan. The Irish-born American actress Ada Rehan played Maid Marian and the cast included Tyrone Power Senior as a Follower of Robin Hood.\n\nThe images include famous playwrights on the front, and Daly's Theatre, Broadway, the Lyceum Theatre, the Theatre du Vaudeville, Paris, and the Memorial Theatre, Stratford on Avon on the back. An  illustration inside shows a couple and their children sitting in a theatre box dressed in elegant evening clothes in the 1891 season, with opera glasses and a programme resting on the ledge of the box.   The advertisements are for local shops and products including Wm. Knabe & Co's pianos, the Hotel Vendome, Broadway, The Chickering Piano, Van Houten's Cocoa, the department store B. Altman, trains from Grand Central Station, Chocolat Menier, Cook's Tourist Tickets, Dunlop & Co's hats, and M\u00f6et & Chandon champagne.",
