They were probably meant as much for display as for strong ale. The cup-shaped form seems to have been used in England exclusively by the London delftware potters.\n\nMaterials & Making\nTin-glazed earthenware, though soft and brittle, had the unique advantage among British ceramic materials of being easily decorated in bright oxide colours. \n\nCollectors & Owners\nSuch mugs, which were never included in the inventories or lists of products of the London potteries, must have formed a minute proportion of their output. Undoubtedly they would have been cheap to buy, yet their decoration has ensured that they were seldom used, so that they have survived in greater numbers than might be expected. Today they are in great demand by delftware collectors.",
