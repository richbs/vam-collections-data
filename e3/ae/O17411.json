A Saturn V rocket's blazing trajectory flanks images of the orbiting Apollo 9 capsule, launched earlier that year, and the view from space of the earth and moon. The Moon and Earth rising in the sky are based on photographs taken on board the Apollo 9 flight.  The image of the beautiful and fragile Earth visible from space changed our concept of the planet on which we live, emphasising its unity and vulnerability.\n\nThis textile, 'Lunar Rocket', was designed in anticipation of the Apollo 11 Moon landing. As the design had not yet gone into full production a sample was displayed in the manufacturer's London showroom on the morning of the Moonwalk.  Stock arrived as Apollo 12 astronauts returned from man's second journey to the Moon. Available in one colourway only, it far exceeded the usual scope of furnishing fabrics, becoming a piece of art in its own right.",
