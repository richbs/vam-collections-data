His hands are supported by the Virgin and St John, behind whom are two mourning women.  To the right is an angel holding the column, and to the left a second angel holding the spear and reed.  Both angels extend a chalice to receive the blood from the wounds in the hands of Christ.  At the back, before an archway, is the empty cross with two flails suspended from its arms. Below in the centre is an angel, standing with the back turned beneath the platform, who raises two chalices to catch the blood flowing from Christ's feet.  At either side are kneeling figures of St John the Baptist (left) and St Jerome with the lion (right).",

His hands are supported by the Virgin and St John, behind whom are two mourning women.  To the right is an angel holding the column, and to the left a second angel holding the spear and reed.  Both angels extend a chalice to receive the blood from the wounds in the hands of Christ.  At the back, before an archway, is the empty cross with two flails suspended from its arms. Below in the centre is an angel, standing with the back turned beneath the platform, who raises two chalices to catch the blood flowing from Christ's feet.  At either side are kneeling figures of St John the Baptist (left) and St Jerome with the lion (right).\n\nThe upper part of the relief is closely related to an onyx cameo in the British Museum which is associable with a number of works which appear to have been carved in Padua around 1500.  Comparison of the terracotta relief with the cameo suggests that the terracotta derives from the cameo, rather than the cameo from the terracotta.  The relief was possible executed at Padua around 1500 in the circle of Giovanni Minelli.",
