Only the front fa\u00e7ade has windows and doors. In the centre of the ground floor is a front door with three glass panels in it and a wooden pediment over the top. There is a knob in the centre of the door and another in the wooden frame surrounding it. The door is reached by a flight of three wooden steps. Flanking it are two large sash windows, each surmounted by a pediment and with a deep sill. On the first floor are four smaller sash windows, each with pediment and sill (three sills, each have one bracket missing). None of the windows or doors open. The roof is pitched with a chimney along the centre of each short side. The front of the house lifts off to reveal four rooms, two on each floor. On the ground floor is a kitchen with a large hearth fireplace and a cardboard oven; also a living room with green floral wallpaper, a painted fireplace, carpet and two portraits on the wall. On the first floor are two bedrooms, with white and gold floral wallpaper fireplaces. Each has four framed portraits on the walls. At the windows are white curtains made of open-weave cotton.",
