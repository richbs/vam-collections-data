The text of the poem reads:\n\nSunset and evening star,\nAnd one clear call for me! \nAnd may there be no moaning of the bar,\nWhen I put out to sea, \n\nBut such a tide as moving seems asleep,\nToo full for sound and foam, \nWhen that which drew from out the boundless deep\nTurns again home. \n\nTwilight and evening bell,\nAnd after that the dark!\nAnd may there be no sadness of farewell,\nWhen I embark;\n\nFor though from out our bourne of Time and Place\nThe flood may bear me far,\nI hope to see my Pilot face to face\nWhen I have crossed the bar.\n\nTennyson uses the metaphor of a 'sandbar' (a ridge of sand built up by currents along the shore) to describe the barrier between life and death. His use of the image of 'crossing' refers to passing from one world into the next and has Christian connotations, with the act of 'crossing' oneself as a Catholic gesture of religious faith and devotion.
