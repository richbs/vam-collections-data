The pillow is contained within a plain white linen pillow case with a frilled edge: the pillow case has a plain opening at the back and fastens with tying strings of white cotton tape.\n[Sheet] Sheet of plain white linen, the upper edge frilled.  One side is a selvage edge, the other and the lower edge are hemmed with hand stitching.\n[Sheet] Sheet of plain white linen, with one selvage edge at the side, and the other edges hemmed with hand stitching.\n[Bolster] Cylindrical bolster of cream and blue striped ticking, the ends bound with striped cream and green cotton tape.\n[Mattress] Rectangular mattress of cream and dark blue striped ticking, buttoned with circles of coloured cloth (red, yellow, blue and two shades of green, arranged in patterns).  The edges, which are gussetted all the way round, are bound with striped cream and green cotton tape of similar fabric.\n[Quilt] Patchwork quilt for a doll's cot, made up of octagonal patches of variously coloured plain and patterned silks; the spaces between the octagons are filled with triangles of dark moss green and ivory-coloured silk.  At each corner is a squared patch of flower-patterned pink silk brocade, possibly of Spitalfields silk, with trimmed corners to make it eight-sided: the design of  the flowered motifs of all four are identical, but each pair of diagonally opposing corner patches is in a matched colour scheme and direction.  The quilt is lined with dark moss green silk and piped at the edges with the same fabric.\n[Cot] Straight-sided rectangular cot of carved and turned mahogany.  The headboard has a decoratively indented top rail but is otherwise plain; the footboard, which is slightly lower, is similar, but the outer face is carved with opposing scrolls across the top rail, above a rectanglar panel with a frame of striped wood veneer.  The corner stays have mushroom shaped finials, each with a button shape on top.  The legs are turned with rings at three points where the profile changes (from cylindrical to bulbous to tapering to inverted baluster at the foot).  Each of the feet is mounted on a socket castor of moulded brass secured with screws.  The base of the cot is a piece of linen cut to fit and nailed in place along the edges.",

Families were sometimes separated,  people had to put items in storage as they moved or were evacuated, and some lost their possessions when their homes were bombed.  In 1948 the donor gave the museum a group of playthings in memory of her mother, Annie Dickinson.  They consisted of a large wax over composition doll dressed as a young child, with a group of doll-sized clothing and equipment that included a mahogany cot and bed linen (including a silk patchwork quilt of contrasting colours and patterns), a chest of drawers, a tea and dinner service, and cutlery.\n\nA toy bed like this could have had considerable educational value for a Victorian or Edwardian girl, as well as being an attractive and fairly prestigious plaything.  It could be used to teach needlework, laundry, and general household management and economy. The repairs and worn areas suggest that it had fairly extensive use, probably over several generations.",
