The box has a clasp, and can be locked. \n\nOwnership & Use\nThe aristocracy and the wealthy classes often had their own personal sugar box that they would take to the table. Sugar was usually kept in the care of the chief house servant, often in a locked container. The coiled serpent handle on this box may indicate that this was a marriage gift, as serpents were considered a symbol of marital harmony.  The initials on the base are probably those of the married couple.\n\nDecoration\nThe decoration on this box is skilfully chased (the metal surface has been modelled with a hammer and steel tools) in a flat manner similar to embroidery. In England this popular decoration was used on silver, textiles, painted furniture and ceramics. The motifs making up this sophisticated style known as 'Chinoiserie' are taken from a number of different sources. These were usually engravings from illustrated travel books about Asia and the Middle East, or painted decoration on Chinese porcelain and other imported works of art from the East.",
