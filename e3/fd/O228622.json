The broad outer border containing bright floral clusters frame the piece along the top and the sides.  The mat is encased within narrow bands of meandering flowers and small leaves. The spandrels of the prayer arch are worked in a trellis grid containing small flower heads.  This area is not quilted.  The sinuous lower edge of which is marked by black and yellow couching straddling a sage green and pink line.  The apex of the arch houses a roundel for the prayer stone, embroidered with the inscription: 'Praise be to God in the highest'. The field is filled with alternating rows of floral sprigs, all flower heads inclining to the left.  The colours change from blues and pastels in the upper part to brighter pinks in the lower.\nThe mat is edged with a green silk fringe.  It is interlined and backed with plain weave yellow cotton printed with rows of floral sprays in red, blue, white and brown. Faced with bias cut blue satin. The backing is held to the mat by three rows of fine running stitches.\nInk under-drawing is visible throughout.",
