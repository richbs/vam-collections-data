Fans of this type could be found hanging either side of the fireplace or arranged decoratively on the mantelpiece.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe technique of penwork involves the decoration of a wooden surface, usually a light-coloured timber such as sycamore, holly or pine, with designs in imitation of oriental lacquer. The wooden surface was first painted black with areas reserved or left unpainted to create the design or pattern. Details were added in black indian ink with a fine quill pen, or in white paint, before a coat of protective varnish was applied. Often the natural darkening of the wood and the discolouring of the paint or varnish resulted in a yellowing effect, as seen on these fans.\n\nOwnership & Use\nUnlike the conventional folding fans, this example was not a fashion accessory for women to carry but was part of the furnishing of a room. However penwork is closely associated with women who enthusiastically used the technique to decorate many small items, such as boxes, fans or trays, as well as some large pieces of furniture.",
