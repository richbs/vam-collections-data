The imagery was taken from an old photograph, hence the old-fashioned costumes and cars. It appears to be a rare advertising commission, done with her typical clean cutting and sense of design.\n\nMorgan was an accomplished wood-engraver who exhibited regularly at the Society of Wood-Engravers. She went to study wood engraving at the Grosvenor School of Art in 1929. She mainly worked on limited edition prints although, from 1936, she produced greetings cards and more commercial items for the private Samson Press. The V&A has several other wood-engravings by her.",
