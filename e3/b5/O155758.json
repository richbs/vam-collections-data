Finally edged with pulled thread and a narrow zigzag band.  In between these corner units is a footed hexagon of pulled thread on the two short sides and a small octagon of needle woven stars either side of a footed hexagon on the wider sides.  \nNB: the footed hexagon on the short side nearest to the Museum Number has deep yellow cotton among the threads.  \nAllthese motifs are outlined with small-scale pulled thread bands.\nIn the centre a large flattened octagon delineated with pulled thread and needlewoven frames, filled with tiny stars of overcast bars.  The remaining central area is filled with small 8-pointed stars and alternate squares of straight stitch.\nThe whole is framed by a wide border in two sections according to the lateral/longitudinal sides - the latter being less accurately planned.\n[a] a narrow row of needlewoven hexagons\n[b] a line of framed flattened hexagons/cartouches of alternating pulled thread or needlewoven stars; the remaining triangular spaces filled with stepped lozenges formed of triangles in straight stitch\n[c] as [a]\n[d] a line of small reciprocal treoil motifs.\nCotton thread: Z-spun\nEmbroidery Thread: white silk; 2S",
