The most important item was a pair of gold earrings.  Their shapes varied widely in different places.  These earrings, with their delicate filigree design and pendants of bunches of grapes made from seed pearls, are typical of the kind worn in the Veneto, the area around Venice.  \n\nThey may also have come from further east.  Similar jewellery was worn with traditional costume throughout the old Venetian colonies of the Adriatic and eastern Mediterranean, and earrings like these survive in the treasuries of many churches in the region.",
