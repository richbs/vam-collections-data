They were commonly set out on mantelpieces, with the largest one in the middle, much as today.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe vase is markedly asymmetrical and very unusual for English porcelain. The design may have been first sketched on paper, but it is so complex that it could only have been fully worked out by modelling it in clay or wax. A full-size model would then have been made. Such models were used to make the hollow plaster moulds in which the vase was cast. The sharpness of the detailing suggests that a casting model of carved wood, rather than clay or wax, may have been used.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe vase is very light and thinly potted, as it was formed by slip-casting. In this process a mixture of clay and water is poured into a hollow mould. The water then evaporates, leaving a thin layer of the clay mixture clinging to the interior surface of the mould. The mould would have been made in two or more pieces in order that it could be taken apart once the vase had been cast.",
