Princess Margaret is seen standing full-length wearing an embroidered gown and dress-gloves reaching past her elbows. She holds her hands by her sides and looks towards the camera. She wears a small crown, a dark sash, and a long cloak is draped from her shoulders. Beside her, Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother is seated. She is seen in profile, looking upwards towards her youngest daughter. She also wears a crown, an embroidered gown, long dress-gloves and a cloak; brooches and insignia are seen decorating the sash worn across her body. Their cloaks are trimmed with thick white and black fur and the trains extend in rich folds into the foreground of the image. The women are flanked by five page-boys; one of whom rests his hand upon the back of the Queen Mother's chair, and another of whom holds the extended train of the cloak worm by Princess Margaret. The scene is framed by large curtains tied back to reveal a painted backdrop, which depicts the exterior of Westminster Abbey (where the Coronation ceremony had taken place shortly before this sitting).",
