He steps from the tomb with his right leg. A soldier, wearing a basinet, tippet of mail, low-belted jupon, gauntlets and armour is represented sitting asleep on the tomb to the left of the figure of Christ, holding a lance in his left hand and supporting his head with his right. A similar figure is represented seated on the right of the tomb, with head and shoulders of a third soldier, holding a falchion, behind him. A half-length figure of an angel, hands raised, is represented in the top left corner.\n\nThe fragment is the upper part of a panel which would normally include a recumbent figure of a soldier in front of the tomb. Christ's right leg and the feet of the seated soldiers are missing. The top left corner of the panel is chipped and the top right corner is missing. There is a hole through Christ's halo. \n\nSome green paint and the usual daisy flowers remain on the ground at the bottom right of the panel. Traces of paint remain on the figures. There are traces of brown and gilding on Christ's hair and beard. Green paint is on the torse. \n\nThe back of the panel is incised XXI. There are two lead-filled holes. The middle of the panel has been scooped out.",

He is shown steppeing from the tomb with his right leg surrounded by sleeping soldiers. A recumbent figure of a soldier in front of the tomb would normally be included in the representation. \n\nThere are two sorts of alabaster. Calcite alabaster is very hard and was used in ancient times. This object is made of gypsum alabaster which is a fine-grained, soft and smooth stone. Although at first glance it looks a little like marble, which it was intended to imitate, it was much easier to carve due to its softness, and alabaster objects were therefore significantly cheaper to produce. Marble does not originate in England, so it was imported if needed, whereas in the 15th century there were important alabaster quarries in Nottingham, York, Burton-on-Trent and London. England was a major centre for the production of objects such as this one. During period, they were exported in very large numbers to Europe where they survive, unlike many examples which remained in England and were destroyed or greatly damaged during the Reformation.",
