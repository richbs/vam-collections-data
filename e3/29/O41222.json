He studied at the London College of Printing and The Royal College of Art and was awarded the John Kobal Photographic Portrait Prize in 1998.  This image is part of a series by British contemporary photographers entitled Making Your Dreams Come True.  It results from a commission awarded by BMW Financial Services Group in 1999.\n\nHunter's work often depicts groups of people with housing problems in a positive light.  These include squatters, council house tenants and  those living in caravans.  This image is representative of his approach to marginal groups.  The two boys and young girl are depicted under a canopy of trees from above with shards of subtle light illuminating their faces to create very intimate portraits.  Hunter has often referred to the Dutch Old Master painter Jan Vermeer in his portraits.",

Part of a entitled <i>Making Your Dreams Come True</i>  the work results from a commission awarded by BMW Financial Services Group.\n\nHistorical significance: Hunter's work often depicts groups of people with housing problems in a positive light.  These include squatters, council house tenants and those living in caravans.  This image is representative of his approach to marginal groups.  The two boys and young girl are depicted under a canopy of trees from above with shards of subtle light illuminating their faces to create very intimate portraits.  Hunter has often referenced the Dutch Old Master Jan Vermeer in his portraits.",
