Some pieces were made by the artists themselves. However, the designs were often given over to specialist craftsmen such as John Joseph Kallenborn, who was responsible for much of the marquetry work for the Omega Workshop. Here, Gaudier-Brzeska's design, as executed by Kallenborn, shows the influence of Vorticism in its 'cubing' of the human form. He also used the 'Wrestlers' theme in a plaster relief and as a linocut.",
