She had been a waitress in a Liverpool caf\u00e9, where he took his meals as a young man, and she later inspired the character of \u2018Angel\u2019 in his autobiographical novel Young Lives (1899). She died in 1894 leaving one daughter. In 1897 he married Julie, daughter of Peter Norregard, railway director, of Copenhagen. They had one daughter, Eva, who became known as an actress and producer. This marriage was dissolved and in 1911 he married Irma, formerly wife of the American sculptor Roland Hinton Perry. Their daughter, Gwen, achieved a reputation as a painter of portraits. Therefore, the woman in the picture could be Mildred or Julie.",
