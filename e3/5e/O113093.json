She bought this house in 1924 and fitted it out for the museum. It is interesting because the back, which has windows and a door like the front, opens on a second set of rooms, so the house can be played with from both sides. The house probably dates from about 1830. The joiner who made it has tried to give it an imposing appearance with tall imitation marble pillars on the front. These are made from lengths of beading which are not exactly the right shape and which the joiner probably had lying around.",
