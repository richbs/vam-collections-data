These pendants were worn in different ways in different regions. \n\nIn Bavaria, the bodice of the traditional costume was laced across the front with a long silver chain, up to six meters in length.  This provided plenty of room for decorative pendants of all kinds, including religious medallions and amulets made from lucky stones, as well as filigree bluebells, like this.\n\nIn Wurttemberg, the women wore detachable white linen collars over their Sunday dress, kept in place with silver chains.  They wore these in pairs, one on each side of the body.  These chains linked the lower outside corners of the collar, at the front and back, by passing under the arm.  At each end there was a decorative hook, which was attached to the corners of the collar, and a filigree pendant like this, called a Gollermasche, was used to weigh the collar down.  \n\nThis pendant carries silver marks showing it was made in Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd, which was the main centre for small filigree objects for the whole of the south German region in the 19th century.  It was bought for five shillings (for a pair) at the International Exhibition, London, 1872.",
