            "public_access_description": "Paolozzi made a series of collages in the 1950s, using material from his archive of advertisements and other images taken from magazines. He gave the title BUNK! to this series of collages. Using the visual language of the mass media, and dissecting and recombining material, he explored ideas about consumer culture and its complex layers of meaning. At this time Paolozzi was a member of the Independent Group, who were the precursors and originators of Pop Art in Britain. Paolozzi's BUNK! collages reflected the Independent Group'saim to \"take Pop culture out of the realm of 'escapism', 'sheer entertainment', 'relaxation', and to treat it with the seriousness of art.\" [Lawrence Alloway, 'The Development of British Pop' quoted in Pop Art, Lucy R. Lippard et al, London 1966)",
