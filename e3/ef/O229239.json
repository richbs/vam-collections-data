Italian goldsmiths were expert at making a little material go a very long way.  This earring looks impressive, but it is only made of metal gilded to look like gold.\n\nAll Italian women wore gold earrings.  Their shapes varied widely in different places.  This earring was acquired in Samnium as a piece of traditional Italian jewellery, but it is more typical of the kind of fashionable jewellery which was worn all over Europe in the 19th century.  It was bought as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
