His lavish, painterly and romantic concepts were perfectly in tune with the times and earned him an international reputation.  By 1960, however, that style was becoming unfashionable, and Messel gradually abandoned theatre and built a new career designing luxury homes in the Caribbean. \n\nRossini\u2019s comic opera La Cenerentola (1817), is based on Charles Perrault\u2019s fairy tale Cinderella (1697).  Prince Ramiro holds a ball and will choose the most beautiful woman in attendance to be his wife.  Cinderella overcomes the malevolence of her step-sisters and step-father to captivate the Prince. Messel designed fun and light-hearted costumes and sets for the 1952 Glyndebourne production.  The production proved popular, and was revived five times.\n\nMessel created this sheet of sample colours to coordinate costume and set colours.   Shocking pink, vibrant lemon yellow, dark blue and turquoise greens with liberal use of gold and silver predominate throughout the costumes and set, complementing the lighthearted, romantic mood of this comic opera.",

It was revived in 1953 (Edinburgh Festival), 1954 (Berlin), 1956 (Liverpool), 1959 and 1960 (Glyndebourne).\nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's theatre designs and other designs and artefacts.  The designs were briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being housed at the V&A from 1981 on indefinite loan.  The V&A Theatre Museum purchased the Oliver Messel collection from Lord Snowdon in 2005.\n\nHistorical significance: Messel worked for Glyndebourne from 1951 to 1959, when he was at the height of his popularity as a designer for the stage.  His work for Glyndebourne in this period is regarded as some of his best designs.",
