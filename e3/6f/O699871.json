Drawing as a discipline</b> \n \n[\u2026]  \n  \n<b>DRAWN COPIES FROM THE ROUND</b>   \n \n[\u2026]\n \n<b>83.</b> William Powell Frith, RA (1819-1909); \nBritish \nStudy of a plaster cast of a bust of a boy \nSigned <i>W.P.F.</i> \nBlack chalk, heightened with white, on buff \npaper. 19 x 25.5 cm \nVAM E.2730-1962 (Given by Mrs I. M. \nGore, Grand-daughter of the Artist) \n  \nAccording to the donor this drawing was made \nwhen Frith was a student at the Royal \nAcademy Schools. He found copying from the  \nAntique irksome. Of his time at Henry Sass\u2019s \nArt School he wrote \u2018The young student, \nbeginning with Juno\u2019s eye, was compelled to \ncopy outlines that seemed numberless\u2026 \nThis course, called \u2018drawing from flat\u2019 was \npersisted in till the pupil was considered \nadvanced enough to be allowed to study the \nmysteries of light and shade. A huge white \nplaster ball, standing on a pedestal, was the \nnext subject of attention; by the representation \nof which in Italian chalk and on white paper; \nthe student was to be initiated into the first \nprinciples of light, shadow, and rotundity. \nThe effect to be produced by a process of  \nhatching,\u2019 Going on to speak of his early days \nat the Royal Academy he said \u2018Though I \nwould gladly have bid adieu to antique  \ndrawing, I found that if I desired to reach the \nupper school\u2026where painting was taught, I  \ncould only do so by drawings which must  \nmeet the approval of the Council. I succeeded, \nafter several futile attempts, in achieving \nthese; and then I was permitted to draw in the \nLife School. There, the whole thing was \ndelightful to me.\u2019 Nevertheless he continued \nto consider this academic training a necessity: \n\u2018Consider the quality of mind and body \nrequisite for a successful artistic career \u2013 long \nand severe study from antique statues, from \nfive to eight hours every day; then many  \nmonths\u2019 hard work from life, with attendance \nat lectures study of perspective, anatomy, etc; \ngeneral reading to be attended to also \u2013 all \nbefore painting is attempted\u2026\u2019 \n(W.
