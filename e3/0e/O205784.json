The earliest datable Staffordshire figures appear to be those of Queen Victoria, who was crowned in 1837.  Images of royalty proved lucrative and during the 1840s Staffordshire pottery firms issued countless other royal figures. Although some appeared after Victoria's death in 1901, few were made after 1905.  During their heyday however they were produced in vast numbers, usually modelled after prints. As well as the royal family they represented a wide variety of subjects, those of actors and actresses being especially popular. This represents the actress Sarah Siddons (1755-1831) as Lady Macbeth in Shakespeare's Macbeth.\n\nSarah Siddons was born Sarah Kemble, and was a member of the extraordinary Kemble family who dominated the British stage in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. When young she acted with William Siddons whom she married in 1773, against her parents' wishes. She first appeared as Lady Macbeth in London in 1785 and soon became London's leading actress, excelling in tragic and heroic roles.  Lady Macbeth was also the part that Mrs Siddons chose for her farewell performance in June 1812.",
