Although the design is 17th century in origin, the pendant itself is more likely to be 19th-century in date.  It was probably made in Switzerland, where high quality filigree jewellery like this, often featuring black and white enamel, was made in urban centres such as Zurich.  Switzerland was famous for its filigree work in the 19th century, and the workmanship of this piece, made of gilded silver, is as fine as similar work made in gold.",
