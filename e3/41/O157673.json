            "public_access_description": "Given the rather profane subject of this mosaic, it might be surprising to learn that it was in fact made at the Vatican Workshop in Rome. The scene is based upon a painting by Francesco Vinea (1845-1902), who was known for romantic paintings based on the themes \"Baccho, tobacco e Venere\" i.e. wine, women and song.\n\nThe execution of this mosaic shows the innovation of the technique that took place at the Vatican Workshop from the first decades of the 20th century onwards. The unpolished surface recalls a relief, and highlights the gem-like quality of the colours of the mosaic pieces. These are comparatively large, but nonetheless masterpieces of technology. Many are the so-called malmischiato (\"badly mixed\") glasses that have been made by fusing various different colours into one glass rod. The areas cast in shadow show what astonishing results can be achieved with such multicoloured tesserae. Economic reasons might have played a part in developing such glasses that enabled a mosaicist to complete a piece in less time. Nonetheless, the tesserae used here do not serve the goal of the painterly illusionism that had been the ultimate criterion for quality in mosaics since ancient times. The rough, unpolished surface and the size of the tesserae reveal its nature as a mosaic even from a distance.\n\nThe Gilberts purchased this mosaic during one of their trips to Italy directly from the Vatican Workshop in 1967. It is one of very few unpolished mosaics in the collection. In 2002, Roberto Grieco (born 1956), a mosaicist with the Vatican Workshop, created another version of this mosaic that is not only very close in terms of dimensions, but also appears to use identical glass in parts of the picture.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes. Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",

The first micromosaics were created in the 18th century, but it was not until Arthur Gilbert himself became interested in collecting them and invented the term 'micromosaics' that they became known as such. The tesserae are minute pieces cut from thin pieces of glass known as smalti filati, and some of the finest micomosaics can consist of as many as 5,000 tesserae per square inch (ca. 3 by 3cm). By the late 18th century Rome had become central to the production of micromosaics and sold them as souvenirs to wealthy foreigners visiting the city. From small elegant snuffboxes to large monumental tabletops, micromosaics could be used to decorate objects of all shapes and sizes. They could even be made to resemble full-sized canvas paintings, and indeed Arthur Gilbert himself mistook his very first micromosaic for a painting. When he brought it home to show his wife, he had to convince her that it was not in fact a cracked painting, as she supposed, but a mosaic.",
