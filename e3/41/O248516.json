Sniffed from the back of the hand, from pinched fingers or from a spoon, snuff was enjoyed on social occasions and would be placed on the table or passed around a group. Thousands of small portable boxes to contain the powder were made as personal accessories, often in novel designs, to be given as gifts.\n\nShoe- and boot-shaped snuff boxes were made throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. Shoes have long been associated with love and marriage and were often given for good luck. The hollow at the top of this shoe would have contained the snuff, which was secured with a hinged lid. The small size and light-weight material of this box would have made it ideal for carrying on one's person. This box is one of a pair, which may have been given as keepsakes between friends or sweethearts.",
