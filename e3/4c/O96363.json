The kepala, or head, and borders are patterned with a  foliage motif. The intervals between the traingles of the kepala have convenional rosettes reserved.\n\nBatik is the name given in Indonesia to the process of applying wax resist-dyed patterns to cloth. The origins of batik in Indonesia are still obscure, and it is possible that primitive methods of wax resist have a long history in Indonesia, but the method using the tjanting--a small copper vessel with one or more spouts and a handle of reed or bamboo--to apply the wax to the cloth presupposes the availability of very finely woven cottons, which during the last 150 years have mainly been introduced from Europe and Japan. Pekalongan is one of the most important centres of batik production in northern Java.",
