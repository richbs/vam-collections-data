Buddhist sites in peninsular Thailand, particularly cave sanctuaries, have been a rich source of impressed clay votive tablets. These tablets confirm the early practice of Mahayanist Buddhism in the region: clay impressions were probably deposited at holy sites by worshippers and pilgrims as votive offerings. This impression depicts the bodhisattva Avalokitesvara in a four-armed form, seated on a lotus. Sanskrit prayers appear in nagari script, supporting the notion that these impressions were made from moulds, almost certainly bronze, imported from eastern India.",
