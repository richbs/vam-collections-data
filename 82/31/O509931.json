The composition is based on a picture of the same subject by Poussin at Dresden, painted about 1637 (O. Grautoff, Nicholas Poussin, 1914, 2, p. 108, no. 66 and Anthony Blunt, The pictures of Nicholas Poussin, London, 1966, p. 122, no. 171). Castiglione has reversed the design, while preserving the same arrangement for the three central figures. Three other drawings by him of the same subject are known. Two of them, at Windsor and Chatsworth, are sketches in pen and ink and wash, dated by Blunt about 1634-40 (see Blunt, Castiglione, p. 28, no. 8 and fig. 6). They are also based on Poussin's painting, and the one at Chatsworth was formerly attributed to Poussin (see W. Friedlaender, Drawings of Nicholas Poussin, 3, 1953, p. 40). In these two drawings the composition is not reversed. The third drawing, also at Windsor, is a sketch in red oil paint and is less closely related to Poussin's picture (see Blunt, Castiglione, p. 35, no. 105 and pl. 13)",
