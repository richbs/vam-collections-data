It was also one of the first to employ modern weaponry. The conflict between Britain and the self-governing Afrikaner (Boer) colonies of the South African Republic (the Transvaal) and the Orange Free State was prompted by Boer attempts to resist British control. Initially, the British underestimated the strength of Boer forces and lost several key areas. However, following the arrival of reinforcements, Pretoria (capital of the Transvaal) was captured in June 1900.\n\nThis pressed glass plate commemorates the occupation of Pretoria on 5  June 1900. Objects marking British colonial conquests were common in the late 19th century but by the early 20th century conflicts such as the South African War caused some in Britain to question the wisdom of continued colonial rule.",

It was also one of the first to employ modern weaponry. The conflict between Britain and the self-governing Afrikaner (Boer) colonies of the South African Republic (the Transvaal) and the Orange Free State was prompted by Boer attempts to resist British control. Initially, the British underestimated the strength of Boer forces and lost several key areas. However, following the arrival of reinforcements, Pretoria (capital of the Transvaal) was captured in June 1900.",
