The skirt is composed of two rows of knee-length streamers tapering to a point, each decoratively stitched to the bodice. The topmost is made of orange velvet stitched in beige, the lower of peach velvet stitched in pink. Each streamer is edged with a gold bead fringe, and lined with bright yellow silk. The belt is a narrow sash in an orange self material doubled with a peach velvet that matches the lower set of streamers. The dress is unlined but the neck and armholes are faced with narrow bands of matching satin. Voisin of Paris made it about 1925.\n\nBy 1925 evening dresses were designed to reflect the frenzy of the newly discovered charleston and jazz dancing. Short and square gowns were often embroidered with sequins, pearls or metallic threads, to achieve the maximum effect of brilliance and to accentuate the movement of the dance.",
