He was most admired for his poetic effects of sunrise, sunset and moonlight (Orrock wrote in 1898, 'As a painter of light he has had no rival, save and except Cuyp'), and also for his classical landscapes inspired by the works of Claude. Exhibited four oils at the RA between 1800 and 1802, and another in 1821, and 19 at the BlI 1820-43. But he was almost exclusively a painter in watercolours. A founder member of the OWS 1804/5, he exhibited there each year for the rest of his life - a total of 581 works. Thirty watercolours are in the V&A collections. Published <i>The Theory and and Practice of Watercolour Paintings,</i>elucidated in a series of letters (1840). Bury states that he visited Italy. Died London 19 March 1842.

Barret's Italianate landscapes were compared to those of Claude by his contemporaries, including Ruskin; the present work does not seem to be based on a specific Claude painting. Barret wrote about ideal landscape in his 1840 book: 'Imitation which employs the hand and eye only can never produce a work of art of elevated character'. \nREPR: <i>Bury,</i>p238\u201d",
