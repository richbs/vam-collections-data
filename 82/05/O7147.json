Inexpensive press-moulded glass, such as this example, was typically used to produce popular royal souvenirs.\n\nHistorical Associations\nFollowing the death of Prince Albert in 1861, Queen Victoria shunned public life to a great extent. She never again lived in London and occupied Buckingham Palace only for occasional visits lasting a few days. However, the 50th anniversary of her accession to the throne in 1887 was marked with great celebration, and the Queen was cheered by hundreds of thousands of her subjects as she travelled to a special service at Westminster Abbey. The public enthusiasm for the Jubilee resulted in the production of an enormous range of souvenirs, such as this plate. In subsequent years, the Queen was encouraged to make more frequent public appearances.",
