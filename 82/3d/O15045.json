The year before, Millais had shown a picture of his daughter sitting upright and attentive in church listening to the preacher's message. This was entitled My First Sermon, and it was a tremendous success with the public. Millais capitalised on the success of that painting with this sequel, in which we discover that the novelty of a church service for a young child has waned. The painting was seen as a warning to preachers to keep their sermons short and to the point.",

It was a tremendous success, was engraved for a wider audience, and mentioned by the Archbishop of Canterbury at the annual Royal Academy Banquet as a paradigm of the piety of childhood.  Millais, with his young family, was at this time in search of more popular success, and capitalised on the 1863 with this sequel, where the novelty of a church service for a young child has faded.
