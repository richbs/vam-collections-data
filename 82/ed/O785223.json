In one of them 'with astonishment I beheld an old old man and an old old woman... making hay, all alone by themselves. They looked like Time and his wife. There was but the one rake between them,  and they both had hold of it in a pastorally-loving manner, and there was hay on the old woman's black bonnet, as if the old man had recently been playful'.",
