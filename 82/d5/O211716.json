'Abbas was killed bringing water to his thirsty brother, Hussein ibn 'Ali, the grandson of the prophet Mohammed. Many of the themes associated with the cult involve water and fertility.\n\nThe ingenious design allows water to be poured into a double walled vessel through a hole at the top of the handle. The lid opens to a cavity where ice could be inserted to chill the water in the surrounding cavity. The Victoria and Albert Museum's collection has several of these vessels, however, many are damaged bottles of Chinese porcelain or Safavid fritware that have been transformed with the addition of metal mounts into similar containers for serving chilled water. \n\nVery few examples of Safavid monochrome ware are found in Western collections. The decoration of a similar vessel in the British Museum (1878,1230.627) may have been inspired by examples of Chinese Fahua technique and glazes, but, as here, the shape follows Indian metalware. The same shape, but without the internal cavity, is also found in Safavid fritware, painted in underglaze blue and dating to about 1680-1700 (2640&amp;2642-1876).\n\n"
