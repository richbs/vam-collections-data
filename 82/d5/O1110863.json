This is a moment from the second scene in the ballet in which Petrouchka in his cell is frustrated by his unrequited love for the ballerina and by the Showman's ability to manipulate his puppets.\n\nThe paper has two small holes down the right side, as if originally contained in an album, and has a small circular sticker bottom right with the number 144 printed in red lettering.",

This production is set in the carnival atmosphere of a pre-Lenten fair in 19th century St. Petersburg. Scene 2 of the ballet shows the puppet Petrouchka in his cell, frustrated by his own limitations and subservient position in relation to the controlling puppetmaster/charlatan pictured on his cell wall. It is a scene of considerable pathos in which the dancer took on the characteristics of the puppet.\n\nThis sketch is part of the Valentine Gross Archive (THM/165), held by the V&A Department of Theatre and Performance. Valentine Gross Archive contains research material and artwork, including sketches, studies, drawings, pastels and illustrations. Only the artwork materials have been catalogued with museum numbers and given item level descriptions found in the Search the Collections webpage. \n\nValentine Gross, a.k.a. Valentine Hugo, was a French art student in Paris in the 1910s. She became a ballet enthusiast, illustrator, researcher and painter. Valentine Gross witnessed annual seasons of Diaghlev Ballets Russes in Paris and made preminary sketches during performances and rehearsals between 1909 and 1914.  She later worked them up into pencil or coloured drawings of various degrees of finish including illustrations and paintings.\n\nSome of the sketches feature in the book Nijinsky on Stage by Richard Buckle, published in London by Studio Vista in 1971. This sketch represents Petrushka about to die in Scene IV and features in the book on page 89.",
