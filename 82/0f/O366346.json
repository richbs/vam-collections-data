In the central vignette, Juno and Jupiter are seated by a festive board surrounded by Cupids. Behind Juno are two peacocks and over Jupiter's head an eagle with outstretched wings. In the left vignette there is a girl riding on dolphins with a boy in attendance and in the right, Diana shooting a sleeping youth. The fan has a gilt and flower border. On the centre of the reverse, Venus is snatching a bow from Cupid. Around the vignette are sprays of Chinese flowers outlined in gold.\n\nThe sticks are of carved ivory with three vignettes linked by floral scrolls and rococo swags, painted to suggest carving. In the central vignette is a classical portico, in the left a flock of sheep and in the right a basket of fruit and flowers. The gorge is carved with the borders undulating so that, when closed, the end of the fan forms a finely carved head, with facial features and tightly curled hair to suggest an African. The guards are carved, painted and gilt with a seated classical couple below a castle and baroque swags. The rivet and washer are both of brass.\n\nOn the right side of the leaf, written in ink is 'No. 1100'.",
