As with many of the Brighton drawings, much of the outline appears to be drawn with the point of the brush.\nTwo of the studies on the recto, the anchor in the middle of the top, and the anchor with the net below on left, were used by Constable as sketches for objects on the beach in his large oil painting 'The Marina Parade and Chain Pier, Brighton', which was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1827, and is now in the Tate Gallery (No. 5957). The drawing was therefore made before 1827, and as the page comes from the sketch-book which Constable was using in 1823 there is no difficulty in supposing that Constable may have reverted to the use of the 1823 sketch-book after a year or two's delay, it is perhaps more probable that this, and Nos. 274 and 275, were drawn in 1824 rather than at a later date.",
