Employed on dishes and decorative items, the finished products decorated with the design were sent back to the Netherlands at the end of 1738 and in 1739. In 1739 a second, simpler version of the design with only three figures was sent to China. This scene was originally designed after a motif in traditional Chinese iconography, illustrating the legend of the woodcutter Wang Shi who encountered three Daoist gods playing chess in a cave. The elaborate border of fish in cartouches was a common characteristic of export porcelain with Pronk's designs. Between 1738 and 1739 five teas services and eighteen mantelpieces with this design were exported to the Netherlands. Due to the high costs of importing privately commissioned pieces the Dutch East India stopped production.",
