But as far as we know not even Constable had time to sketch on his wedding day. In fact, he was married in 1816 on 2 October, so here he was commemorating the anniversary rather than the event itself. At the time Hampstead was still a rural village separate from London. The low viewpoint of the drawing emphasises the height and majesty of the trees and lends an element of drama to the scene. It is possible that this is the drawing that the poet and painter William Blake saw, exclaiming: 'Why, this is not drawing, but inspiration!' Constable is said to have replied, 'I never knew it before; I meant it for drawing'.",

It had been mounted on card, and this might account for the absence of clearer evidence on the point.\nConstable was married on 2 October 1816.\nPossibly this is the drawing which is the subject of C. R. Leslie\u2019s anecdote about William Blake (L. ed. S., p. 36): \u201cThe amiable but eccentric Blake, looking through one of Constable\u2019s sketch books, said of a beautiful drawing of an avenue of fir trees on Hampstead Heath, \u2018Why this is not drawing but <i>inspiration</i>\u2019; and he replied, \u2018I never knew it before; I meant it for drawing\u2019.\u201d\n\nNote on Nos. 191, 192, 200, 203, 204, 206, 220, 238, and 239 [297-1888, 257-1888, 622-1888, 251-1888, 351-1888, 271-1888, 353-1888, 609-1888, 799-1888]\n\nNos. 191 [297-1888], 192 [257-1888], 220 [353-1888], and 239 [799-1888] are untrimmed leaves from a sketch-book, of which the pages measure 6 3/8 x 9 \u00be ins. (161 x 237 mm.) and some bear the Whatman watermark of 1818.  The dimensions of Nos. 200 [622-1888], 203 [251-1888], 204 [351-1888], 206 [271-1888], and 238 [609-1888], all of which have been mounted on card and probably trimmed, show that they most certainly come from the same sketch-book.  The dated leaves show that Constable used this sketch-book in 1820 (Nos. 191 [297-1888], 203 [251-1888], and 206 [271-1888]) and in 1821 (Nos. 220 [353-1888] and 238 [609-1888]).",
