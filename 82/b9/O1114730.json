The costumes for this production were originally designed by L\u00e9on Bakst in 1909 but were redesigned by Delaunday in 1918. The costume consists of a very revealing strap which fastens over the shoulders and across the chest and a short, semicular, skirt. \n\nBoth the chest piece and skirt are made from cotton and decorated with appliqued motifs in satin and velvet outlined in heavy metallic braid. The chest piece is a dull purple and decorated with small black triangular motifs interspersed with thick lines of braid. It fastens at the back with large hook and eyes. The skirt section has a purple ground and is decorated with stripes and half circles in orange, green and black. The skirt consists of a series of panels with a large, semicircular, central panel and smaller circular panels on either side.   \n\nCl\u00e9op\u00e2tre was a one act, dramatic ballet, choreographed by Fokine to music by Anton Arensky. Additional music was added for specific dances by Sergei Taneyev (Prelude); Nikolai Rimsky Korsakov (Entry of Cleopatra); Mikhail Glinka (Veil Dance); Alexander Glazounov (Bacchanale) and Moussorgsky (Persian Dance). It was first performed by the Ballets Russes on 2 June 1909 at Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet, Paris. The first London performance took place on the 7th of July 1911, at the Royal Opera House. The scenery and costumes for the original production were designed by Leon Bakst, but in 1918 Robert Delauney was engaged to produce set designs for a revised production. This revised production included new costumes for Cleopatra and Amoun designed by Sonia Delaunay.",
