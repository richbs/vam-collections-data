The relationship to bells with Venetian connections suggests that city as the probable centre of production.\nBells played an important role in everyday life during the 16th century, regulating the working day, calling worshippers to church and announcing special occasions such as weddings and funerals. \n\nSmall bells were either rung by hand or suspended from beams and struck with a hammer. Hand bells were both religious and secular in function. They were used in religious rituals and were commonly decorated with figures of saints. Small bells were also used as doorbells, and to call servants and institutions into action. The sounding of a bell had a number of meanings from warning to protection from danger, calling order, regulating routine and announcing civic and religious occasions.",
