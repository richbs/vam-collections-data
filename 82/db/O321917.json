            "physical_description": "1083-1869 is composed of ten individual wooden panels mounted on a board. Each wooden panel was once part of a minbar (a pulpit in a mosque). The central decorative feature of each carved panel, is a floriated lobed scrollwork carved in relief. Behind this is a carved strapwork also carved in relief. Each panel is carved with a different design. Framing the carved scrollwork and strapwork are two thin inlaid bands of bone or ivory. Between these bands is a carved border filled with a gouged oval pattern. The panels have a dark red colouration, which suggests they were carved from Rosewood. The shapes of the panels vary: there are four octagonal panels, four hexagonal panels and one in the shape of a five pointed star. The five pointed star is inlaid with a more complex ivory border and the central carved design is a wheeled strapwork. \n\nEach of the ten individual panels would have formed part of a radiating circle design, which formed the surface of the minbar (pulpit in a mosque). The four octagonal panels formed the central focal point of this pattern: photographic evidence of the panel formation still exists.",

Altinbugha Al-Maridani (1318 to 1343A.D) was governor of Aleppo between 1342-1343 A.D. His mosque was built in 1339-40 A.D. It was praised by the historian al-Yusufi (1277 -1358 A.D.) as being one of the most lavishly decorated in Cairo. The minbar was part of this rich decorative scheme, which also included an intricately turned wooden screen which still exists today. These panels were identified by Stanley Lane Poole (1854- 1931A.D). According to Lane Poole, the Al-Maridani panels had distinctive inlaid borders formed from a double ivory line, which were enclosed in a series of thin wooden beadings. \n\nThis set of panels formed part of the Meymar collection \u2013 a collection of Middle Eastern objects acquired by the Turkish bureaucrat Dr Meymar, who lived in Cairo during the 1860s. According to Stanley Lane Poole Dr Meymar had the Al-Maridani panels \u2018partly comprised in the top of a French table.\u2019\n\nThis collection was exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1867, from where the South Kensington Museum (later the Victoria & Albert Museum) made a large number of purchases to enhance their growing collection of Islamic art. Together with the collection of Gaston de Saint-Maurice (accessioned in 1884), the Meymar collection was the foundational collection of \u2018Saracenic\u2019 art \u2013 or the art of the Mamluks (ruled Egypt and Syria 1250-1517) \u2013 in this museum.\n\nIn 2008 the minbar in the Al-Maridani mosque was looted and stripped of all its surviving panels. The safety of objects still in situ within the mosques of the medieval city of Cairo has become a key cultural heritage issue in Egypt.",
