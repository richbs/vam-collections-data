The figures of his right hand are held in the traditional attitude of blessing, but the hand is pointing downwards, not raised as might be expected. The bearded Judas stands next to him, placing his left hand on Christ's shoulder to embrace him. A soldier grasps Christ's cloak from the left while St Peter is shown cutting off the right ear of Malchus with his sword. \n\nThe unusual downwards pointing position of Christ's right hand is not peculiar to this panel and instead is found in many alabaster panels of the Betrayal. This gesture probably refers to Christ's healing of the ear of Malchus. \n\nThe top of the panel has a embattled canopy, a feature popular in the early 15th century.  This feature links it to four other panels in the V&A (A.152-1946, A.154-1946, A.171-1946, A.172-1946) which must originally have formed an altarpiece showing scenes from Christ's Passion.",
