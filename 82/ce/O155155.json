The theatre club was started in 1979 by the American director and writer Lou Stein in a room above the Prince Albert Pub in Pembridge Road. Dedicated to producing the best works of foreign writers, by 1981 the Gate established itself as one of London's best fringe venues, along with the King's Head and the Bush. In 1982 the club expanded to include a brand-new custom-built studio theatre above the Latchmere Pub in Battersea.\n\nLou Stein's adaptation of Orwell's novel featured two narrators on stage representing the young and the more mature Orwell recounting his life, with other characters, notably Boris the Russian refugee in Paris played by Michael Kilgarriff, and the tramp Paddy, played by Ronan Wilmot. This production was a celebration of the fifth anniversary of the Gate Theatre club, and also - since it was produced in 1984 -  a tribute to Orwell, the author of the novel 1984.",
