The poems on it include the wish that 'the pen may write the Sultan's official signature with ink from this well\u2019. The inkwell was originally attached to a pen case.\n\nAlthough production of objects of inlaid brass and tinned copper continued, around 1550 a new type of brassware with fine, engraved decoration emerged in Iran. Stylised plants and other ornament were shown in relief against a hatched ground, originally filled with a black compound. The decoration was often arranged in bands or cartouches that matched the shape of the object. Poetic inscriptions in the elegant \u2018nasta\u2019liq\u2019 style of Persian calligraphy were also common. Human and animal motifs, absent since before 1400, reappeared.",
