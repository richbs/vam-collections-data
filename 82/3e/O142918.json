            "public_access_description": "This image of the Ethiopian emperor Tewodros II (Theodore) was created shortly after his death on 13 April 1868. Frustrated by a lack of communication from Queen Victoria\u2019s government, back in 1864 Tewodros had taken a number of Europeans captive, including the British consul, Captain Cameron. The British response was a military expedition of huge complexity and expense led by General Sir Robert Napier. The expedition marched to Tewodros\u2019s fortress at Maqdala where a brief battle took place. Britain won the conflict, but not before the captives were released and Tewodros himself had committed suicide.\n\nThe expedition \u2013 and the characters associated with it \u2013 caught the imagination of the British public. In particular the figure of the Ethiopian emperor, variously described as a \u2018barbarian potentate\u2019, \u2018tyrant\u2019 and \u2018mad, wild king\u2019, was a popular focus. Yet Tewodros could also be portrayed admiringly as a noble warrior \u2013 an attitude which this image seems to reflect. The original sketch was created by Richard Holmes, the British Museum\u2019s special correspondent who accompanied the expedition. Text printed on this carte de visite records how Tewodros's likeness was captured \u20181/4 of an hour after his death\u2019.",
