Roma built this house in the 1980's, paying incredible attention to detail, reproducing ration books, identity cards, newspapers, and photo albums by reducing copies of the original versions. The photographs show her family as they appeared at that time. Each doll is also modelled on a family member with Roma appearing as one on of the children in a school dress. The house accurately reflects the wartime era, showing popular products, foodstuffs, games, and furnishings from the time.",
