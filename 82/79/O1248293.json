Canova hardly ever allowed his working models to pass out of his possession.  This model is one of three which the sculptor gave to an English friend, the author Mary Berry (1763-1852), probably when she visited his studio in Rome in 1820-1.  Miss Berry in turn bequeathed her models to her friend George Howard, 7th Earl of Carlisle, describing them as \u2018unique, nobody possessing any sketches by the same artist from whose hands I received them in Rome.\u2019  They remained at Castle Howard until the model for Hebe was sold at auction in 1991. Hebe\u2019s head and the extremities of her limbs seem to have been deliberately omitted, focussing attention onto her dynamic, twisting torso. \nThe exquisite tightly clinging drapery is recognisably modern, but also pays homage to antique prototypes.",
