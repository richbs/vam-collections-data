The Movement culminated in the work and ideas of the writer and critic Oscar Wilde and the artist Aubrey Beardsley. In the 1920s there was a fashion for portrait caricatures, published in magazines such as Vanity Fair. Max produced images of a wide range of society figures. This watercolour shows Martin Hardie on the left, who was Keeper in the V&A department responsible for paintings, drawings, illustrations, designs and engravings. With him are the stage designer Edward Gordon Craig and Craig's son, Gordon.",
