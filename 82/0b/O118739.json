The chairs were made in about 1909 for the offices of the Essex and Suffolk Equitable Insurance Company which were then located in Capel House, 54-60 New Broad Street, London.  The initials of the firm are decoratively arranged within a circle on the leather upholstery on the front of the chair back. \n\nThe chair's tall back with uprights extending above the top rail is typical of chair designs by Voysey.  Also typical is the use of subtle curves, such as those found on the front seat rail and top rail of the back.  The overall simplicity of the chair's form reflects the pared-down nature of Voysey's designs, a principle he applied to all disciplines including his architectural work.",
