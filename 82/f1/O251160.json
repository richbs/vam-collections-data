Every year from 1987 to 2006, while David Watkins was Professor of Goldsmithing, Silversmithing, Metalwork and Jewellery at the RCA, he invited four jewellers and silversmiths from outside Britain to give a week-long masterclass. The artists brought diverse skills, aesthetics and approaches. The first call on their time was to interact closely with the students. In addition, although concentrating on their teaching and working in an unfamiliar studio, each artist generously made an object for the RCA's collection. The Royal College of Art Visiting Artists Collection, now transferred to the V&A, is a major document of international contemporary jewellery, a tribute both to the artists and to the vibrancy of the RCA as a teaching institution.\n\nFelieke van der Leest (born 1968) studied in the Netherlands at the Vakschool Schoonhoven and at the Gerrit Rietveld Academy, Amsterdam. She is known for her colourful and humorous work which usually combines plastic animals and crochet. The crocheted discs relate to her time in London at the RCA - inspired by a design of concentric circles printed on a London Underground tube map.",
