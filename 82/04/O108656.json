Constructed between 1639 and 1648, the complex covers an area of 125 acres and was only one part of an entire city called Shahjahanabad, the seventh of the seven historical cities of Delhi.\n\nThe British photographer Samuel Bourne lived and worked in India between 1862 and 1869. During this time he toured the Himalayas and travelled through the subcontinent, photographing its landscape, architecture and historical sites.
