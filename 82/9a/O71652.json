On either side is a panel with bright-cut edges and a small reserve with foliage.  Around the outside of the rim runs a border composed of a white ribbon interwoven with a wreath of leaves.  On the sides at  the ends and at the centre of the front and the back there are four oval reserves, each containing a festooned white vase on a matted ground.  Between these oval reserves are panels with bright-cut borders, each panel divided in the middle by a pilaster surmounted by a wreathed head.  The decoration of the base is similar to that on the lid, but the oval reserve contains a lyre, a trumpet and a white music score.",

In 1783 in France manned flight was achieved with both gas and hot-air balloons.  After trials with animals, a tethered hot-air balloon designed by Joseph-Michel and Jacques-Etienne Montgolfier flew with two people on 19 October 1783 in Paris, and the first free flight with human beings took place on 21 November 1783.",

In 1783 in France manned flight was achieved with both gas and hot-air balloons.  After trials with animals, a tethered hot-air balloon designed by Joseph-Michel and Jacques-Etienne Montgolfier flew with two people on 19 October 1783 in Paris, and the first free flight with human beings took place on 21 November 1783.",
