The body is\nmounted on four straight legs which in turn are mounted on a flat plank nailed to the rockers. On the body towards the rear is an upright with two curved side panels to form a seat back. The rockers are semi-circular and solid pieces of wood painted black. The mane and tail are added to the horse and are made from lengths of thick black wool. The horse is painted white with large black spots and the eyes are shaped with black paint. It may have been repainted but is in good condition. There are traces of red paint on the rockers which may or may not indicate that these have been repainted or that the wood was originally red before being up into the rocking horse. The reins are formed from two very long red boot laces; knotted together and hooked through a loop on each side of the nose.",
