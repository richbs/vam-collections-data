March & Company giving the words of thirty-six songs sung in pantomimes, originally music-hall hits.  They include songs by well-known music hall stars of the day such as George Robey, Marie Lloyd, Eugene Stratton, Gus Elen and Tom Leamore, all of whom regularly appeared in pantomime at the turn of the 19th century.  It was sold for 1/6d, or was available 'post free' for twenty stamps (presumably penny stamps since there were eighteen pennies in 1/6d, and the two extra stamps would have covered the 'post free' postage!)  The back page includes advertisements for other items printed by March & Co., such as a guide to dreams and fortune-telling, a book of beauty product recipes, and a guide to 'True Politeness'.\n\nThe front page features a wood engraving of a pantomime Principal Boy below stage, waiting to make her entrance through the star trap which can be seen above her head. Stage hands on either side are shown ready to release the weights which would have sent her upwards at speed, while the prompter reminds her of her words.  Star trap entrances were popular with audiences because of the elements of surprise and theatricality, but extremely arduous for the performers whose heads opened the hinged segments of the circular stage trap as the counterweighted platform propelled them on stage.",
