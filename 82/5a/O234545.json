He has recently completed an impressive series of interior views of castles and historic houses, including Hampton Court, Belvoir Castle, Strawberry Hill and Apsley House. \n\nEaux-Fortes de Ruysdael was made in preparation for an exhibition (held in December 2008) at the Francis Kyle Gallery in London on the theme of libraries. Buchanan came to see the National Art Library in early 2008 and was shown the West Room, which at that time housed large volumes of prints and printed elephant folios. His resulting work - which, at over a metre high, is on an impressive scale - is a virtuoso display of watercolour technique. The striking perspective is richly evocative of the National Art Library's particular atmosphere.",
