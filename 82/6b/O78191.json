This print was made from a glass negative.\n\nOwnership & Use\nJulia Margaret Cameron (1815-1879) printed photographs to show in fine art exhibitions and gave copies to family, friends and sitters. In 1865 the South Kensington Museum (now the V&A) became the first museum to exhibit and purchase her works. That same year Cameron sent 34 photographs as a gift to the collection. Her photographs were deposited in the Art Library and in the Circulation Department (which distributed artworks and teaching materials to tour throughout the country). However the Museum's Prints, Drawings and Paintings Department acquired  this particular photograph in the 1990s.\n\nPeople\nThe two people in the photograph are Cyllena Wilson (on the left) and Mary Ryan (on the right). Wilson was the daughter of a missionary orphaned at 15 and adopted by Cameron. Later, in 1870, she ran away from the Camerons' home on the Isle of Wight. Ryan was a London beggar who had approached Cameron. The photographer was struck by her beauty and offered her a job as her housemaid while also employing her as a model."

            "public_access_description": "Julia Margaret Cameron's career as a photographer began in 1863 when her daughter gave her a camera. Cameron began photographing everyone in sight. Because of the newness of photography as a practice, she was free to make her own rules and not be bound to convention. The kinds of images being made at the time did not interest Cameron. She was interested in capturing another kind of photographic truth. Not one dependent on accuracy of sharp detail, but one that depicted the emotional state of her sitter.\n\nCameron liked the soft focus portraits and the streak marks on her negatives, choosing to work with these irregularities, making them part of her pictures.  Although at the time Cameron was seen as an unconventional and experimental photographer, her images have a solid place in the history of photography.\n\nMost of Cameron's photographs are portraits. She used members of her family as sitters and made photographs than concentrated on their faces. She was interested in conveying their natural beauty, often asking female sitters to let down their hair so as to show them in a way that they were not accustomed to presenting themselves. In addition to making stunning and evocative portraits both of male and female subjects, Cameron also staged tableaux and posed her sitters in situations that simulated allegorical paintings.",
