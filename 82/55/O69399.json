The coat is made of silver grey silk lined with blue satin. A design of random patchwork appliqu\u00e9 in shades of blue, silver and gold and green is stitched from shoulder to hem at the sides and along the bottom. The patchwork is overstitched. Natalia Goncharova designed it in 1925 for the Maison Myrbor (House of Myrbor) in Paris.\n\nNatalia Goncharova (1881-1962) had a long career with Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. She produced astonishing costumes that were inspired by her Russian background and her work with avant-garde artists. Like many Russian refugees in Paris, she also designed dresses. These strongly reflected her work for Diaghilev. Between 1922 and 1926 she worked for the Maison Myrbor. This exclusive shop was owned by the Italian Marie Cuttoli. It sold fashion, rugs and curtains designed by the international avant-garde.",

She was frequently the subject of articles in the New York Times during the early 20th century. Her clothes were purchased from couturiers in London, Paris, and New York, and demonstrated an elegantly avant-garde approach to style.\n\nAt the time of acquisition, Miss Grigsby's friend, Miss Chisholm said that the patchwork on this mantle was executed by Madame Coutoli, who had an embroidery workshop in Algeria.",
