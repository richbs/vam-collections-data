The velvety appearance of the pile comes from the use of pashmina - the fine hair from the underbelly of the Kashmir goat, from which Kashmir shawls are made. This was used for pile carpets in preference to silk by carpet-weavers of Mughal India in the 17th and 18th centuries. Silk thread was used for the warps and wefts that form the underlying structure of the carpet.\n\nA large portion of the carpet from which these fragments came is today in the Frick Collection in New York, but it too is formed of a patchwork of fragments.",
