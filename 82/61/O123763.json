It is appropriately decorated with emblems of music - the back carved in the form of a lyre with two pipes crossed in the centre, the round medallions painted with female musicians. The arms, carved as dolphins, represent the dolphin that saved the life of the Greek poet and musician Arion. \n\nThis chair is a rare example of 18th-century furniture retaining its original paint. Painted decoration was highly fashionable in the 1770s-80s, and the mixture of colours used here was intended to evoke the colouring of ancient Greek, or 'Etruscan' vases. The painted musicians in the backs of the chairs may be copied from engravings. This forms another link with the Music Room at Woodhall, which was - and still is - decorated as a 'print room', with engravings pasted all over the walls and the cove of the celing.",
