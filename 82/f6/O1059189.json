Full citation:\n\n\u201c<b>Unknown Woman</b>\n<b>1670-5</b>\nP119-1910 \n\n<b>Oval 48 x 36 mm\n</b>\nFeatures in fine hatches of brown and sanguine, with red in the lips, on a thick pale carnation ground; the hair washed and hatched in brown with gouache lights; costume in transparent blue wash with the lights in white; background washed and hatched in greys; on vellum put down on very heavily sized pasteboard. \n\n<b>Condition:</b> The white in the dress badly flaked; some minor abrasions; the hair retouched and the background heavily retouched with zinc-white. \n\n<b>Signed:</b> Not signed. \n\n<b>Frame:</b> Nineteenth-century oval silver-gilt locket, the back nearly flat and forming an arris above the narrow grooved side, which holds the convex glass in a bezel; the hanger of D-section with a deep central channel, flanked by two diminishing spirals of six turns which begin in a pair of reversed loops overhanging the back of the locket. \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> Acquired by George Salting (1) from an unknown source; by him bequeathed to the Museum, 1910. \n\n<b>Literature:</b> Foster 1911 (as by Flatman); Long 1930, p. 18 (as attributed to Dixon); <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 16. \n\nIn the Salting Collection the miniature was listed as 'style of Flatman', and the sitter was called <i>Anne Hyde, Duchess of York</i>(1637/8-1671). Long instantly noted that the style was that of Nicholas Dixon, and this attribution has not since been questioned. Though damaged and restored, the miniature carries considerable conviction as an autograph work of Dixon in the early 1670s. \n\nIn his review of the Salting Collection when it was placed on exhibition at the V&A in 1911, Foster (2) recognised that the sitter bore no resemblance to the <i>Anne Hyde</i> by Lely at Hampton Court, (3) but he seems not to have rejected the identification. It is in fact quite untenable. On the evidence of her hair alone, the portrait dates from after 1670, at which time Anne Hyde was dropsical and dying of cancer. The portrait of her at this time in the NPG, of a type also attributed to Lely, confirms the appearance of the Duchess shortly before her death and shows the impossibility of the Salting identification. \n\n1 Salting Collection, no. 4634. \n2 Foster's view of the attribution to Flatman is not clear, for he made no serious attempt to include Salting's Flatman miniatures in the <i>Alphabetical List</i>. He has two entries, one certainly for Cat. No. 122 and another, given laconically as 'Undescribed ... Salting Bequest', could be almost anything. \n3 c.1666; Beckett 1951, no. 574.\" \n",
