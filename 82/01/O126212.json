His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nMessel\u2019s painterly and poetic interpretation of medieval period costume and architecture complemented Christopher Fry\u2019s verse play, The Lady\u2019s Not For Burning (1949), Fry's first play to be presented at a West End theatre.  \n\nFry recalled 'The set was enchanting; the inventiveness of it stays in the mind - the hanging birdcage, the shelf behind Tyson's desk, the way to the garden, the feeling of Spring.  It was all a bit grand and ecclesiastical for an impecunious mayor of a small country town, perhaps.  But the charm of it, and particularly the space of sky, by sunlight, rainlight and mooonlight, outweighed any such reservations.'
