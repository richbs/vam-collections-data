At this time, glass workers making 'fancy' glass trapped silver or gold foil between two layers of glass. The Stevens & Williams glassworks in Stourbridge, West Midlands, made the most elaborate version, known as 'Silveria'. It had twisted foil shapes, emphasised on this vase by trails of green glass and splashes of yellow glass. Here some of the silver foil has kept its original colour, while some has a red colour created by the action of oxygen.",
