It is not known exactly when he set sail for India, but certainly by May 1864 he was in Bombay, where he was preparing to accompany the French surveyor, traveller, photographer and writer Louis Rousselet on travels around central and northern India which would last until September 1868. On 10 June 1864, Schaumburg joined Rousselet in Baroda, where they spent about six months as the guest of the Gaekwar (ruler), who gave them the use of a summer palace. Here Schaumburg painted portraits of the royal couple and several views of Baroda and its surroundings. Schaumburg and Rousselet then spent the next few years travelling around central and northern India, especially the princely states, and it was probably around this time that the artist painted this picture of the old city of Amber in Rajasthan. In September 1866 Rousselet returned to Europe and Schaumburg remained in Calcutta, where he worked for the Geological Survey of India as an artist and possibly as Chief Draughtsman (1875).Schaumburg also became Acting Principal of the Government School of Art in Bow Bazar Street and Chairman of the Sculpture Committee for the First International Exhibition in Calcutta in 1883-84. He had won an award for his own artwork at the 3rd Calcutta Fine Arts Exhibition held in 1879 and also a First Class Silver Medal award for figure and landscape painting. Schaumburg died suddenly of a fever on 17 February 1886.",
