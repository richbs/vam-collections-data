This chair is unusual in having two different tones of gilding: some of the carved ornament, including the husks on the legs, has a greenish tint, contrasting with the yellower gilt background.",

The five armchairs and a settee of this set are at Downing Street (as of 1980).\n\nRP MA/1/P2269 Nominal File Ministry of Works Part X 1940--1946 records the purchase of this chair. The first reference to it is a receipt for the collection by the Ministry of Works from 'Mr Bert Crowther, Syon Lodge, Br[...] Corner (Between Brentford and Isleworth)', of '1, 7'0  Adams Settee + 2 Cushions / 6 Elbow Chairs', on 15 April 1946, and delivery to the V&A on same day. \nMemo by W. A. T[horpe], 29/4/1946, 'Bought by M. of Works for 10 Downing Street, and to be regilt at Museum on condition that one of them is given to the Museum.'\nFurther correspondence records that after regilding the suite (6 chairs, 1 settee and 2 bolsters) was reupholstered by A. E. Chapman & Co., 32 Crouch Hill, Stroud Green, N4 (collected by Chapman's on 16 October; the bulk of the finished suite delivered by Chapman's 21 October; and the single armchair delivered by Chapman's to the Museum on 29 October 1946).",

The chief point of resemblance is the presence of a portrait medallion in the top rail; otherwise the chair and the design differ in virtually every detail, and are of only loosely comparable form.\nIf the two-tone gilding is original, this could be a clue to the maker. There appears to be no record of John Linnell using two-tone gilding.",
