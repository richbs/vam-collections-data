He then entered the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. He travelled in the Netherlands in 1846 and was influenced by the Dutch Old masters' free technique. Upon his return in Paris he specialised in landscape and genre paintings.\n\nThis painting is a fine example of Courbet's late period when he painted some of his most beautiful landscapes. The present painting shows a view of the ch\u00e2teau St Denis, in Scey-en-Varais, near the artist's home at Ornans, between Besan\u00e7on and the Swiss border. The technique employed here by the artist, by means of flecks of colours, moves away from his realistic representation to anticipate somehow the Impressionists' manner.",

Although he attended the Atelier Suisse, he was largely self-taught as an artist. He painted portraits, landscapes and scenes from country life in a very realistic manner and became the acknowledged leader of the 19th century realists in painting. From 1844 he exhibited in the Salon. He joined the Commune in 1871 and was sentenced to six months' imprisonment for having been implicated in the destruction of the Colonne Vend\u00f4me. In 1873 he settled in Switzerland, where he died. \nLit. G. Riat, <i>Gustave Courbet,</i> Paris, 1906; G. Mack, <i>Gustave Courbet,</i> 1951. \n\n55 \nLANDSCAPE, WITH THE CHATEL ST.

The stream that flows down towards the foreground is La Loue. This view is near the artist's home at Ornans, between Besan\u00e7on and the Swiss border. Courbet apparently painted three versions of this landscape: one was sold around 1922 by Pierre Faverger in Neufch\u00e2tel, Switzerland (whereabouts unknown) while another is currently housed in the Mus\u00e9e d'Art et d'Histoire, Geneva.\nThis painting was executed during what is generally considered as a period of decline in Courbet's career. Because of his involvement with the revolutionary Paris Commune (18 March-29 May 1871) Courbet had to flee to Switzerland, where he specialised in mountain scenes. \nHaving enjoyed a great success while exhibiting at the Galerie Durand-Ruel in 1872, Courbet decided to instruct a number of painters in his style in order to increase his output as he sometimes signed some of these works. These artists included  Marcel Ordinaire (1848-1896), Ch\u00e9rubino Pata (1827-1899) and Andr\u00e9 Slomcynski (1844-1909), but also Auguste Baud-Bovy (1848-1899), Fran\u00e7ois Bocion (1828-1890), Ernest-Paul Brigot (1836-1910), Jean-Jean Cornu (1819-1876), Hector Hanoteau (1823-1890) and Alphonse Rapin (1839-1889).  \nAlthough these collaborations were a disaster, Courbet painted in the same period some of his most beautiful landscapes such as the present one, which in some ways can be interpreted as an answer to the Impressionists (even though Courbet was not able to see the first Impressionist Exhibition of 1874). In this painting, Courbet broke indeed the light reflection and colours into flecks and spots in a technique similar to that of the Impressionists.",

            "historical_context_note": "Although France and England became the new centres of landscape art in the 18th century, the Italian and Dutch traditions retained their authority. However the Arcadian vision of Italy increasingly tended towards a more precise observation of nature. Some of the most exciting developments took place in Venice, in the soft scenes of Francesco Zuccarelli (1702-1788), inspired by Claude Lorrain (1604-1682), and the fresh, spontaneous landscapes of Marco Ricci (1676-1730). Wealthy patrons, often accompanied by artists, on The Grand Tour, created a market for veduta and capriccio paintings, respectively topographical and fantasist landscape paintings. Landscape conventions were further enriched by foreign artists working in Italy, responding both to the beauty of Italian light and scenery celebrated by the Latin poets and vividly captured in the most popular landscapes of Claude Lorrain, Nicolas Poussin (1594-1665) and Gaspard Dughet (1615-1675).",
