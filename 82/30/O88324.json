            "public_access_description": "This is a knife handle of a pair with a fork. The objects are made in France, probably in Dieppe in about 1750. The ivory handle of the knife is carved with the figure of a male in classicising armour with bow and quiver, while the handle of the fork is representing a female figure holding a heart in her left hand, and what seems to be a sheaf of corn in her right. They were called Mars and Venus respectively by Longhurst, however their exact identification remains uncertain. The female figure could well be the goddess Ceres.\nKnives have been used since prehistoric times, but the history of knives, forks and spoons for eating in Europe probably commenced in the fourteenth century, and their use became accepted by the sixteenth century. Until the late seventeenth century it seems to have been common practice for people to carry their own cutlery, often in a leather case. \nEbony, ivory, fish skin, tortoiseshell, amber, bone, horn and shell were all popular for decorating cutlery. Around 1730 ceramic handles were introduced to Europe from China. Although cutlers were required by their guilds to be able to make a complete knife, handles of carved ivory, silver, bronze and glass were usually imported or made by specialist craftsmen.",
