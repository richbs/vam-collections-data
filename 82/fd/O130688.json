Critics often dismissed such pictures as intellectually undemanding, yet some of the most important artists of the day took up the subject. The emotion of these pictures centre on a new, 19th -century conception of childhood as an innocent, separate state to be shielded and prolonged. They seek a protective, affectionate pang from the viewer and evoke nostalgia for the inevitably fleeting nature of childhood.\n\nCharles Dickens wrote that fairytales \u2018keep us in some sense ever young, by preserving through our worldly ways, one slender track not overgrown with weeds, where we may walk with children sharing their delights\u2019.",
