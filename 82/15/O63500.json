The headdress worn by Pavlova as the Swan in the hand coloured photograph on the front of Dandr\u00e9's book \"Anna Pavlova\" (Cassell, London,1932) also has a central blue oval jewel. In an interview with Sue Gainsford [Birds on the wing, The Independent Extra, 23 May 2007 p13]  Marguerite Porter, who learned the role from Ninette de Valois, confirmed that the jewel should be blue.  The creature is drowning, swept along by currents and tides, pulled, pushed, carried against its will, doing its best to stay above the water but dragged down towards it ... there is no flapping about, or collapsing. It is very pure, very unsentimental ...'  \n \nThe jewel came to the Museum as part of the Cyril Beaumont Bequest.",
