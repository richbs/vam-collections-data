They are made of very fine yellow gold filigree, overlaid with shapes cut out of red sheet gold, and are sometimes decorated with a small plaque of enamel.  This pendant has stylised rays of the sun, but other motifs, such as stars, hearts and crescent moons, are also common.  It was probably intended as a wedding gift.  \n\nThis pendant has gold marks which show that it was made in the south of Italy in the first half of the 19th century.  The same distinctive technique was also used for earrings and finger rings.  Similar pieces are still being made today in the same region.\n\nIt was bought as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
