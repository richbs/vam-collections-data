The town was founded in the late 15th century, as its name implies, by Albanians fleeing from the Ottoman invasion of their homeland.  The Albanian tradition is maintained in the language and religious practices of the place, as well as the costume.\n\nThe marriage belt is the most important piece of jewellery for the women of Piana.  Its name, \u2018brezi\u2019, is derived from an Albanian word meaning \u2018race\u2019 or \u2018progeny\u2019 and the term refers to the function of the belt as a symbol of marriage and motherhood.  These belts are always made of silver, and have very large and heavy detachable clasps which are usually decorated with the image of the Virgin, as here, or one of the patron saints of the town, such as St. George.\n\nAlthough this clasp and belt carry identical silver marks, they are very different in style.  It has been suggested that the belt, which appears to date from the late 18th century, was submitted for marking at the same time as the newly-made clasp, in the mid-19th century.",
