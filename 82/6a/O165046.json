He works in series, often recording scenes that, as he suggests, are 'so familiar and obvious they fall below the threshold of people's attention'. This photograph is from Gill's 'Trolley Portraits' series of women with their shopping trolleys - a typical sight on the streets of London that Gill renders both banal and monumental. It is a special edition print, made to coincide with the exhibition of this work at the Arles photography festival in 2004.",
