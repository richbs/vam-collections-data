It evokes a sense of the harsh Indian sun that she has been exposed to whilst going about her daily life.  \n\n A related drawing is illustrated as pl.18 of a monograph on the artist Laxma Goud, Andra Pradesh Lalit Kala Akademi, 1981 and this phase of his work discussed in the final paragraph of G.M.Sheik's essay on the artist in this publication. Laxma Goud's drawings of peasants and tribals from his village of Nizampur (40 miles from Hyderabad where he now lives) often show evidence of his interest in 1975 in scraps of junk, leather and metal objects which are incorporated into bodies parched by their barren surroundings.",

Unlike typical representations of village life, he does not present an idyllic and romanticised image. His intimate knowledge and understanding of rural life allows him to depict his subjects in a truthful and sometimes humorous way. He sees the village as a very open society, where man and nature interact dynamically. In this drawing, Goud captures the vitality and calmness of this village woman. He uses very fine pencil lines to depict her hard, rough skin, which evokes a sense of the harsh Indian sun that she has been exposed to whilst going about her daily life.  \n\nLaxma Goud was born in Nizampur, a village in South India (Andhra Pradesh) in 1940. After a diploma in drawing and painting from the Government College of Art and Architecture, Hydrabad in 1963, he studied mural painting and printmaking at M.S. University, Baroda (1963-65).",

Unlike typical representations of village life, he does not present an idyllic and romanticised image. His intimate knowledge and understanding of rural life allows him to depict his subjects in a truthful and sometimes humorous way. He sees the village as a very open society, where man and nature interact dynamically. Thus his prints portray the close relationship of villagers with the animals and landscape, capturing their vitality and lust for life.",
