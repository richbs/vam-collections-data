The all-over design consists of rocks and water with clouds above, bamboo, pine, chrysanthemums and plum blossoms. There is a screen fan at the bottom front and a rustic pavillion at the centre front. The technique of decoration is based on the <i>chaya-zome</i> or <i>chaya-tsuji</i> method whereby the entire background is resisted against the dye leaving the motifs blue against the white ground. The dyed designs have been enhanced with satin stitch embroidery in black, white, purple, orange and two shades of green, and also with gold laid and couched work. There is also stencilled imitation tie-dye in dark red.\nThe garment is lined throughout with thin scarlet plain weave silk and there is a small wadded hem.\nAlterations have been made to the top part of the kimono. There is a seam at chest level which runs right round the garment proper as well as the lining. There is also a seam across the front of each of the sleeves at a slightly higher level than the chest seam. Two vertical inserts have been seamed into the back of the garment on either side of the usual back seam, and extended from the horizontal chest seam up to the collar band.",

The design has has been created using a paste-resist method called chaya-zome, which involves the extensive coverage of the fabric with rice paste, leaving only small areas of design to create the pattern when the cloth is dyed.  This highly skilled and expensive technique, which results in an indigo blue design on a white ground, was reserved for the summer kimono of high ranking samurai women. Here the technique has been combined with a stencil-dyeing technique called kata kanoko and embroidery in silk and metallic threads.",
