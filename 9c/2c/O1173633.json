In 1956 she moved to Canada and thence to the United States, where she directed and managed a number of theatres. She returned to England in 1987. The letters are from her theatrical contacts and cover her career from the 1930s to the 1990s. Associated production: Susannah and the Elders. Recipient and actor: Joan White.
