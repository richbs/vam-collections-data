The Museum Director of the time, Caspar Purdon Clarke, commented 'The selection of objects from the collection of plate was a difficult matter as many pieces were greatly admired by their owner for the fineness and difficulty of workmanship - qualities which in the early 18th century often predominated over those of beauty of form and delicacy of design.'",
