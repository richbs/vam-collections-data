There are two cords of plaited black and cream thread attached to each end of the horseshoe, one of which, at each end, ends in a tassel of coloured threads.  The horseshoe is decorated with 40 complex silver elements.  Each element consists of a ring, which is threaded on the lower row of the horseshoe, with a hollow conical part below it.  The conical part has a loop at the bottom holding a ring with two pendant bells.  There is an open filigree disc on the front of each ring, which extends downwards in a fan shape over the top of the conical part, and upwards as a granulated disc with a granule above it.  This upward extension is sewn to the upper part of the horseshoe.",

They were worn across the forehead, as well as round the neck.  \n\nHowever, this piece was described as an \u2018Ornament for Bit, Saracenic, from Cairo\u2019 when it was acquired by the Museum in 1884.  It may well have formed part of the ornamental trappings of a horse.  The padded wool frame is much more reminiscent of horse harness than of the flat ribbons usually used for women\u2019s jewellery, and there is plentiful evidence that Arab horsemen decorated their beasts as richly as their women. \n\nIt is more likely to have been made in Arabia than in Egypt.  The ornamental silver is typical of the kind of filigree work made in the Yemen by Jewish silversmiths in the 19th and 20th centuries.",
