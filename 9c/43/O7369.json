The unfolding motion between one state and the other does not disturb the contents of the two drawers.  Furthermore, the handles in the drawers, which can be opened from either side, allow it to be easily moved when it is folded as a chest.  The design maximises space-saving within a small home by incorporating the potential for various uses. But unlike neutral, modular space-saving storage systems, this remains an elegant piece of furniture which stands alone.\n\nTomoko Azumi first showed the Table=Chest at her 1995 Royal College of Art degree show.  The potential flexibility of uses for furniture was a popular idea in 1990s design, of which this is an excellent example.  But unlike most folding furniture, which can only be used in one position and folds to be stored, the Table=Chest remains useful in both its positions.",
