Below the numbers are flat keys, the centre three  can be pressed down and these are connected to springs housed in the body of the box. In the long holes at the top fits a large lever (which is broken) that protrudes underneath.\nThe box from the other end has a black rubber cone on each end square and between them are three tubes with the springs covered by plastic plates. It should be possible to place rockets or missiles in each of the tubes, to be held by the lever ratchet and fired by the flat keys. \n2. broken piece from the lever \n3. broken hook",
