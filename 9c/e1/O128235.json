The fairy costumes and fantasy elements are set in a 'real' world, inspired by the soaring architectural fantasies of the 17th and 18th centuries and costumes based upon mid-late 17th century fashions, mixing English, Spanish and French period styles.\n\nThis costume for the Queen is in the Baroque manner, extravagant and encrusted with decoration which, in the drawing, seems almost alive.  In 1946, when there were severe restrictions on the supply of fabrics, finding enough lavish fabrics must have been very hard and, in the end, this dress was the most expensive in the whole production, costing over \u00a3100 - a huge sum in those days.  \n\nIn reality, the cloak and train, being of fur, would have been very heavy.  To produce something of the same weight on stage would not have been practical for the wearer, so they were made in net trimmed with 'ermine tails' and, around the edge, a tubular trim, which would have given it weight and shape in movement.  \n \nOliver Messel (1904-1978) was Britain\u2019s leading theatre designer throughout the 1930s, \u201840s and \u201850s, mastering every aspect of entertainment - ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue - as well working in interior decoration and textile design. His lavish, painterly and romantic concepts were perfectly in tune with the times and earned him an international reputation.  By 1960, however, that style was becoming unfashionable, and Messel gradually abandoned theatre and built a new career designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.",

The production was in the repertory for nearly twenty-five years.  Messel revised the designs several times, with major revisions in 1952 and 1960 and he reworked the designs when the production was mounted in 1959 for the Royal Ballet Touring Company.  \nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's theatre designs and other designs and artefacts.  The designs were briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being housed at the V&A from 1981 on indefinite loan.  The V&A Theatre Museum purchased the Oliver Messel collection from Lord Snowdon in 2005.\n\nHistorical significance: The production of <i>The Sleeping Beauty</i> was an immediate success and established itself as the Sadler's Wells (now Royal) Ballet's 'signature' work, associated with many key events in the company's history.  These included their first sensational appearance in New York in 1949 (which established the company's international reputation in America) and Russia in 1961, when they took the ballet, performed by a British company barely thirty years old, back to the place of its birth in St Petersburg.  Messel's designs were a significant part of the ballet's success.  Sarah Woodcock said of this production \"<i>The Sleeping Beauty</i> was to be Messel's biggest and most enduring production \u2026 The production was performed nearly one thousand one hundred and fifty times, from London to Los Angeles, from Leeds to Leningrad, becoming the Company's 'signature ballet'.\" (Pinkham, ed., 1983).",
