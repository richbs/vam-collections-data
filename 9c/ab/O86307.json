It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre. He compiled them in a series of albums. Stanley was on the bill at the Grand that week with Verno & Voyce doing their \u2018Jack Sheppard!\u2019 sketch, a double act later drawn by Cooke.\n\nStanley never became a top-billing comedian, but was one of the hundreds of stand-up comedians earning a living on the halls in the early 1900s. They were useful \u2018front curtain\u2019 acts, meaning that scenery could be changed behind the curtain while they did their act in front. This is one of two drawings of Walter Stanley by George Cooke in this collection. The other shows him out of stage costume.",
