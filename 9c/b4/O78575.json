These first appeared in the late 17th century. The sugar container was usually larger than the other vessels, and later condiment sets continued that distinction. As this vase is taller and wider than the other two vessels, it would have been used to serve sugar.\n\nDesign & Designing\nCondiment containers were made in a variety of styles, reflecting the fashionable taste of the time. Most share an upright, vertical shape, such as the cylindrical, vase or pear shape that can easily be held. The cover is generally in the form of a dome. The shape of this vessel is in the Neo-classical taste, with a vase body form, fluted decoration and  high looped handles. The design was popular from the 1770s until just after 1800.\n\nHistory\nIn contemporary inventories, a condiment vase such as this was referred to as a  'vase caster', 'vase' or 'urn'. On the grandest tables, where an epergne (an ornamental table piece, often with several bowls) displaying fruit provided a centrepiece, the sets of casters could be grouped around it for guests to help themselves to condiments. Surviving designs show that condiment vases could be bought with a stand, which would increase their visual  impact. Eventually, silver vases began to be replaced by glass vessels grouped as a cruet set.\n\nPeople\nThe Daniel Smith and Robert Sharp partnership (1763-1788) supplied high-quality silver in the Neo-classical style to the most fashionable retailers and clients, including the Prince Regent. They were the principal manufacturers of a series of magnificent race cups, one of which was designed by the architect Robert Adam (1728-1792).",
