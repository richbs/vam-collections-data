This, however, was no bar to Messel's imagination - he had always used materials creatively, knowing that, in the theatre, the real on stage often looks strangely artificial, whereas artifice looks 'real'.  Thus instead of lace for the ruff, he used wired crin (a rigid synthetic mesh) edged with pipe cleaners formed into picots (decorative loops).  Expensive braids were recreated using gold paper and raffia.  \n\nDesigners are often wary of using black on stage, as it can create a 'dead' area, so for the scholarly Prospero, instead of black Messel used a dark blue green, which would have been more 'lively' under the stage lighting.  \n\nOliver Messel (1904-1978) was Britain's leading theatre designer throughout the 1930s, '40s and '50s, mastering every aspect of entertainment - ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue - as well working in interior decoration and textile design. His lavish, painterly and romantic concepts were perfectly in tune with the times and earned him an international reputation.  By 1960, however, that style was becoming unfashionable, and Messel gradually abandoned theatre and built a new career designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.",
