Robert Bremner wrote a tutor, or instruction manual, which was published in Edinburgh in 1758. This example has six courses of strings tuned in the key of C major: the two in the bass are single and the other four double. The fingerboard has a series of screw-holes for a capo, a bar-like device which makes it easier to play in different keys. Brass tuning pegs took the strain of wire strings better than wooden ones and those shaped like rings and lined with ivory, like this example, were more comfortable to grip.",
