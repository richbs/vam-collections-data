The outermost is blue, then light blue and two pink. Then a two coloured patten in double faced 3/1 broken twill showing running animals (horses or goats) of the same appearance and in light and dark blue colour. The animal pattern is app. 20 tablets wide and 2 cm wide. After this a mostly reddish part follows patterned with geometrical figures. These figures are not well defined but look like trials. The reddish pattern consists of stripes of mainly pink and stripes of mainly red bottom weave. The threading of the pink stripes are pink, red, dark blue, light blue. The threading of the red stripes are two red, one white and one blue thread. The width of the red section is at least 7 cm, which will be 70 tablets. The border has at least 95 tablets,\nThe warp is z-spun double threads and the weft is brown z-spun single threads. At the right end of the border the starting point of the border is seen and the twisting of the tablets slowly growing to the pattern (Lisa Raeder Knudsen, August 2008).",

The upper part shows running horses in pale blue on dark blue ground and below a reddish part with geometrical figures. It is unclear what these fragments would have been used for, although they are likely to have had a decorative purpose. They were reovered from the site of Miran Fort on the eastern verge of the Taklamakan desert. At this site material was discovered in the remains of a fort held by the Tibetans during their domination of the southern Taklamakan in the 8th century AD.\n\nThe site is also part of an area of Central Asia we now call  the Silk Road, a series of overland trade routes that crossed Asia from China to Europe. The most notable item traded was silk. Camels and horses were used as pack animals and merchants passed the goods from oasis to oasis. The Silk Road was also important for the exchange of ideas. Whilst silk textiles travelled west from China, Buddhism entered China from India in  this way. \n\nThis textile was brought back from Central Asia by the explorer and archaeologist Sir Marc Aurel Stein (1862-1943). The V&A has around 650 ancient and medieval textiles recovered from the Silk Road by Stein at the beginning of the20th century. Some are silk while others are made from the wool of a variety of different animals",

When Tibetan troops occupied the area in the late eight century AD, they built the fort to guard one of many routes through which they moved into Central Asia. In 1907, Stein excavated rubbish heaps at the fort and found wood slips, dating from the eight to the ninth century AD, which provided early examples of Tibetan writing. He also found fragments of wool rugs in bright colours and pieces of silk. The V&A holds a large number of textiles from the Miran Fort on loan, including spun wool, pattern and plain woven silk and wool, woven and spun hemp, woven horsehair, cords and painted silk.",
