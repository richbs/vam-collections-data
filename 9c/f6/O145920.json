            "historical_context_note": "Probably copied from one of a series of four sketches by Hamilton for intended panels above the niches in the Saloon at Kedleston Hall. Hamilton's drawings date from about 1768, but the panels were probably never executed. Although the subject of SD.524 (apparently a merchant, or wealthy visitor, arriving at a port where he is introduced to a group of women, possibly female slaves) does not correspond exactly with Hamilton's sketch, the drawing seems nonetheless to be related to the series.  See L. Harris, Robert Adam and Kedleston, 1987, p.62. Another version of SD.524 was exhibited at P & D Colnaghi, May 1984 (13). The practice of copying designs for interior decorations was \nwidespread at this period.\nLeslie Harris, Robert Adam and Kedleston, The National Trust, 1987; P & D Colnaghi, English Drawings & Watercolours, May 1984.",
