Coaches were always a highly important emblem of the wealth and power of monarchs and in this case George I took the opportunity to add a strong statement about his intentions as king.  He came to the throne in 1714, after the death of Queen Anne, and by 1718 had already had to face an uprising of the Jacobites, British supporters of the Stuart dynasty.\n\nThornhill painted the panel with figures representing the virtues of Clemency, Prudence and Justice supporting the royal arms.  Below are gathered figures representing the Roman goddess Minerva (patron of learning and the arts) to the left, and the Roman god Mercury (the messenger of the gods, personifying eloquence and reason) to the right, with a group of seated women representing Liberty, Discretion and History.  In the centre is a figure representing Heroic Poetry (holding up a scroll). We know the significance of the figures in part because of the emblems they carry but also because they are identified in an inscription on a preliminary drawing, which is also in the V&A collections (D.756-1886).\n\nThornhill was appointed History Painter to George I in 1718 and Sergeant Painter (a more lucrative post) in 1720.  He turned his decorative talents to ceilings, walls and theatrical scenery, as well as to coach panels.",
