Most of these brooches are penannular in shape, with all the decoration lavished on the head of the pin, but true ring brooches, like this example, survived in a few places, mainly in Algeria, up to the end of the 19th century.  \n\nCircular ring brooches were used singly, in the centre of the forehead or on the chest, unlike the penannular brooches, which were always worn in pairs to hold the dress together.
