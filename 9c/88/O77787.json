It is signed by Jacobus Constantin, an artist who is otherwise unrecorded. He is likely to have been a Continental artist, perhaps from The Netherlands, working for the Stuart court.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe King is seated on his throne, holding his sceptre and crushing with his left foot a representation of Discord, shown as a half-naked man with a serpent. Two classically dressed female figures, Peace and Justice, flank the King and jointly crown him with a laurel wreath of victory. Justice holds a sword and scales, while Peace holds an olive branch.\n\nMaterials & Making\nIvory was a precious and relatively expensive commodity, used at this date for portraits, and for allegorical images. It was particularly favoured by Netherlandish and German sculptors, who also used it to carve religious scenes. Ivory tusks were probably imported from Africa, where they were often bought at the same time as slaves, who were shipped to the sugar plantations in the West Indies. Ivory could be carved relatively easily, although occasionally faults led to breaks during the carving process. Because of the size and shape of the tusks large ivories are rare, many being even smaller than this piece.",
