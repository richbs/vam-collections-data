Modelled in ivory-coloured wax on a black painted ground, he is depicted in middle age, bare-headed and with curly hair and sideburns. He wears a military uniform with tasselled epaulettes and a frilled shirt. \n\nDuring the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, low relief portraits in wax became popular in Britain and they were often exhibited at the Royal Academy, the Society of Artists and elsewhere. Waxes were used in a similar way to prints and medals, in order to disseminate the image of the sitter, or, like miniature paintings or silhouettes as portable mementoes. Wax was well suited to being cast and reproduced many times over from the same mould in order to propagate an image.",
