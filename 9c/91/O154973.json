            "public_access_description": "This portrait of Captain James Cook shows the explorer surrounded by the accoutrements of his trade. Nathaniel Dance's representation lacks the stiffly-posed formality of many naval portraits of the time, with Cook depicted as as a pragmatic, yet distinguished, figure. \n\nSeated at a table with a distant view of the sea behind him, Cook is attired in the Royal Navy's splendid captain's uniform, his loosely buttoned waistcoat and the dynamic position of his legs show him to be an alert and practically-minded man. With one hand, Cook gestures to his chart of New Holland (the historic name for Australia) and the South Indian Ocean, reminding the viewer of his voyages to the South Pacific, where he navigated and documented uncharted areas. His gaze is fixed to the right, looking beyond the picture plane, with an expression of focussed determination.\n\nThis print was published posthumously following Cook's death in Hawaii on the 14th of February, 1779, while undertaking his third voyage to the Pacific.",
