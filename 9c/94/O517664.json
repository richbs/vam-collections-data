Visually impaired from birth, she developed cataracts in mid-life, but an operation at Moorfields Eye Hospital in 2007 (after the three prints which she donated to the museum were made) left her sight much improved. After years of 'living in thick brown gravy' as she described her visual ability, colours came back. \n\nIn much of her work she uses the  barcode as motif and signifier. In a barcode, each sequence of bars, while looking quite similar to the next, is unique, and the key to very specific information. While Brendon is unable to attain the detail and precision of image making that fully sighted artists might, she can still make works that refer to the significance of coded messages. Much of her work uses actual photographs of the eye, taken by herself as well as a professional opthalmic photographer.\n\nThis print differs from the two others by Brendon in the collection, which form single blocks of colour. Here the barcode takes the form of sequential blocks, suggesting a progression or narrative in the information implied in the image.",
