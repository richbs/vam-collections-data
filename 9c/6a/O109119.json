She went up to the post at the end of the bed, above Holofernes' head, and took down his sword that hung there. She came close to the bed and took hold of the hair of his head, and said: 'Give me strength this day, O Lord God of Israel!'. And she struck his neck twice with all her might, and severed his head from his body. After a moment she went out and gave Holofernes' head to her maid (Judith 13, 1-10)\".\n\nThis tapestry woven cushion cover shows the episode of Judith who saved her city of Bethulia from the siege of Holofernes, general of the Assyrian king Nabucodonosor, by killing him after a banquet.\n\nHeroines from the bible, such as Judith, Abigail and Esther, who saved others by their courageous actions, were celebrated for their virtue and depicted throughout the 16th and 17th centuries in a variety of media ranging from paintings and enamels to textiles.",
