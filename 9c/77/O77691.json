The use of an inner case with an outer protecting case is characteristic of London watches in the late 17th century and much of the 18th century.\n\nPeople\nRichard Colston was the son of a clockmaker, and became a Freeman of the Clockmakers' Company in 1682.  He probably died soon after 1702.\n\nNathaniel Delander was an important casemaker who made cases for a number of watchmakers, including Thomas Tompion.  This silver case is typical of its period in that it bears no hallmark.   When Delander was threatened with prosecution by the Goldsmiths' Company in 1682 for making a sub-standard gold case, the Clockmakers' Company asserted that gold and silver cases were not liable for hallmarking.  However, from 1683 hallmarked cases with Delander's mark are known.\n\nOwnership & Use\nThe crescent on the chevron in the arms of the Strickland family, which decorate the outer case, shows that the watch belonged to a second son.",
