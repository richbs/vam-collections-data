This is a printmaking technique in which acid is used to bite lines in a metal plate. These lines are next filled with ink, which is then printed on to paper.\n\nWhistler was one of the first artists to put his pencilled signature to a print. This practice grew up during the second half of the 19th century in order to identify works printed from surfaces made by the artist him- or herself, as opposed to reproductions of works originally created in other media.",
