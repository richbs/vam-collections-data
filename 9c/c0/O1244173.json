Lonnen in the burlesque  musical Faust up to Date at the Gaiety in 1888. The script was written by G.R.Sims and  Henry Pettitt and only received lukewarm reviews. Lonnen, who was playing  Mephistopheles, was simply described as 'energetic'. The one element of the show that  was a success was the music, and the Quartet, danced by four girls, was a huge success.\n\nIn the early days of burlesque, the tradition had been to put new words to well known  tunes as in John Gay's The Beggar's Opera. By 1888 however, original music was being  commissioned for new plays and Faust up to Date had music by Meyer Lutz and lyrics by  Albert Chevalier.\n\nCreated: Late 19th century to early 20th century.",
