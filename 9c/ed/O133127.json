Illustrated menus such as this were printed in advance on land with the inside (menu part) left blank, to be printed on board ship. Passengers often kept them as souvenirs. The menus reflect the luxury of cruise liner travel during its heyday. \"Strathmore\" was built in 1935 for P&O.  She was kept until 1963, when the newly merged P&O-Orient Line replaced its pre-war fleet.\n\nThis illustration after a watercolour by F.W. Baldwin is of Crowland Bridge, a famous landmark in Lincolnshire. Baldwin lived in Walberswick on the Suffolk coast and his watercolour paintings often featured nearby local landmarks.",
