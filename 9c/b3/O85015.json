At christening and other ceremonial occasions, families wrapped their swaddled babies in christening blankets or bearing cloths. They were of rich materials, typically silk velvet, or silk woven or embroidered with a pattern in gold or silver thread. They often had elaborate borders. \n\nSuch blankets displayed the wealth and status of their owners, and would be used only on special occasions, treated with great care, and passed down through the generations.",
