The design is of a loop, like a pleated ribbon, widest where it loops down and narrowing towards the sides of the design.  There is a dark brown ribbon above with undulating lines tied with a bow, with tassels at each end.  This bow is not in the centre of the top of the design.  There is a loop at the right side of the design. There is a trailing stem with little flowers and leaves which is arranged to echo the loop of the pleated ribbon loop but in the opposite direction.  The design is on laid paper. There is a row of pinholes along the top, above the dark ribbon, and along the bottom edge, in the centre, and in the centre of the left side and down near the lower part of the right side.",

The pattern repeats along the border. \nThe design comes from a group of designs that were part of a retailer's archive which employed professional embroiderers. The names of the female clients inscribed on the designs were of the aristocracy.  Miss Emily Pelham gave her sister's (Lady Middleton's) pattern to a family friend, Miss Holroyd. The Pelhams and Holroyds had country homes in what is now Surrey and East Sussex respectively and so not far away.  The families came to London for the season.  Lady Middleton (who was Frances Pelham) died in 1783 and so five years later Emily gave her sister's design to her friend.  Retailers who sold such designs were linen drapers and lacemakers, both of which categories existed in London and were available to the clients. Many pattern drawers worked in London where their trade proved a lucrative business during the season. The similarity of some of the designs from this group to those by Styart, whose designs were published in London, does support the argument that these designs came from a retailer's archive based in London.",

            "history_note": "This design was acquired as two separate objects in 1973 although I discovered in 2003 that it was two halves of one design that had been torn into two prior to acquisition. There is thus a museum number, with the same year of acquisition, on each half of the design.\n\nThe designs were bequeathed to the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1973 by Raymond Johnes who had 'enormous and miscellaneous collections'.*  Johnes' collection included Japanese art, on which he published,** Indian and European material.  He did not specialise in collecting textiles although he owned some examples.  He was in contact with the Museum 1920s-1970 offering to sell objects from his collection.  Johnes did not provide the Museum with information about the history of ownership of the designs. \n\n*Mr B.W. Robinson, former Keeper of the Far Eastern Department, V&A, in a letter to Mr Ayres, Assistant- Keeper in the same Department, V&A Regsitry, nominal file, (MA/1/J479). \n\n**Johnes, Raymond. <u>Japanese Art</u> London: Spring Books, 1961. Conservation joined the two halves together in 2004.\n\nHistorical significance: The names of the female clients inscribed on the designs were of the aristocracy.  Miss Emily Pelham gave her sister's (Lady Middleton's) pattern to a family friend, Miss Holroyd. The Pelhams and Holroyds had country homes in what is now Surrey and East Sussex respectively and so not far away.  The families came to London for the season.  Lady Middleton (who was Frances Pelham) died in 1783 and so five years later Emily gave her sister's design to her friend.  This design is a copy of a design inscribed 'Lady Middleton (Miss Frances Pelham) June 17th - 1785' E.224-1973.  It is puzzling why the design is dated two years later than Lady Middleton's death.  The fact that Lady Middleton's design was copied and given by her sister, Emily Pelham, to Miss Holroyd is evidence that women shared designs for embroidered dress.  Presumably they did not mind wearing the same pattern as another person in the family or whom they knew socially.  Lady Middleton's design was dated '1785' however and the copy is dated '1788'.  Perhaps it was acceptable to wear the same pattern after a few years.", 
            "place": "London", 
            "production_note": "The design comes from a group of designs that were part of a retailer's archive which employed professional embroiderers. The names of the female clients inscribed on the designs were of the aristocracy, gentry or from wealthy families that moved in the upper reaches of society.  They had homes in the country and came to London for the season.  Retailers who sold such designs were linen drapers and lacemakers, both of which categories existed in London and were available to the clients. Many pattern drawers worked in London where their trade proved a lucrative business during the season. The similarity of some of the designs from this group to those by Styart, whose designs were published in London, does support the argument that these designs came from a retailer's archive based in London.  The two inscriptions on the design are evidence of the repeated use of designs.  Lady Middleton - Miss Emily Pelham - The Hon. Miss Holroyd.",
