They set up the company in 1912 with premises on the Rock Estate in Rushden, Northamptonshire.  Such was their success that they soon moved to larger premises at Rectory Road, Rushden in 1914.  The company provided all manner of everyday shoes and boots for both men and women as well as what were known as 'fashion shoes'.  \n\nThe elaborate lattice-work decoration on this pair of men's Oxford shoes means that they would have been part of this latter category.  Men's shoe fashions in Britain during the 1920s were relatively conservative.  Plain brown or black leather lace-ups were the popular choice for everyday wear.  Although this pair is not as bold as some of Coxton's other more flamboyant designs they still stand out as something out of the ordinary.",
