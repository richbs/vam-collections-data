It had the great advantage over other types of pottery in that it could be painted - in a technique similar to watercolour - with great freshness and spontaneity. Although the potteries of London did not aspire to hiring professional artists as at Delft in The Netherlands, some of their in-house decorators were competent enough at copying a medal or engraving. Thus several plaques of Charles II (1630-1685) and especially of Queen Anne (1665-1714) have survived.\n\nPeople\nWhen the young Charles II and Colonel Careless sheltered at the home of the Penderell family at Boscobel House in Shropshire after the Royalist defeat at the Battle of Worcester in 1651, it was suggested that they might hide from the searching Cromwellian soldiers by climbing up into 'a great oak', taking with them 'some victuals for the whole day viz. bread, cheese, small beer, and nothing else'. Thus they escaped, to become the subject of legend.\n\nSymbolism\nFor every Royalist enduring the loss of Charles I's life, the exile of his son Charles II and the harsh rigours of the Commonwealth in the 1650s, the image of the King in the mighty oak, surrounded by the crowns of his three kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland, must have seemed like a talisman. Upon the Restoration of Charles II in 1660, this folk-art image became a potent symbol of loyalty, used on inn-signs, pottery and embroidery. It was later adopted by the Jacobites, loyal to the Stuart cause.",
