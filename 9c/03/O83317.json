            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nThis hat was made for a doll, known as Lord Clapham, that is thought to have belonged to the Cockerell family, descendants of the diarist Samuel Pepys (1633-1703). The daughter of Pepys's nephew John Jackson (the son of his sister Pauline) married a Cockerell, who had a family home in Clapham, south London.\n\nDesigns & Designing\nLord Clapham offers a fine example of both formal and informal dress for a gentleman in the 1690s.  His formal outfit includes a coat, waistcoat and breeches, while his informal dress is represented by the nightgown. Accessories such as the stockings, stock (a form of stiff, close-fitting neckcloth) and gloves are very valuable since very few items  from this early period survive in museum collections. Equally important is the demonstration  of how these clothes were worn together.\n\nOwnership & Use\nDolls were widely produced in the 17th century, although very few survive, due to the wear and tear they usually undergo. The high quality of Lord Clapham and his clothes indicates that he would have been expensive. There is little evidence of use, which suggests that he was admired by adults rather than played with by children.",
