The tapestries were intended to hang in the Sistine Chapel in Rome, built by one of Leo's predecessors Pope Sixtus IV (1471-84). The Chapel was primarily intended for the use of the Pope and the Papal chapel, the body of clergy and Laity immediately surrounding him.  The decoration of the chapel under Sixtus dealt largely with the theme of the Pope's authority. The tapestries continued this theme, illustrating scenes from the lives of St. Peter and St. Paul who were seen as the founders of the Christian Church, and the sources of the Pope's authority and power.  They had in addition woven borders showing scenes from Leo's life, also designed by Raphael: the cartoons for these have not survived.  \n\nThis cartoon shows how after witnessing their cure of a cripple, the inhabitants of Lystra mistake Paul and Barnabas for the local gods Jupiter and Mercury.  They prepare to offer a sacrifice to them.  Paul tears his clothes in dismay, while he and Barnabas try to stop the sacrifice, admonishing the Lystrians for their idolatry.\n\n\nFor further information on the Raphael Tapestry Cartoons please see the V&A website under : Collections, Paintings & Drawings, Paintings & Drawings Features, Raphael Cartoons.",
