The dominant system is dark blue outlined in white and the secondary system is dark green. The blue spiralling stems link the large palmettes and composite blossoms, and the green spiralling stems bear small blossoms, rosettes and leaves. Jennifer Wearden suspects there has been disruption to the pattern in the upper part of the carpet because the spirals disappear from view. The pattern is mirrored across the central vertical axis. There is one pair of very large composite blossoms, and many more of varying sizes, and cloud bands surround some of the larger motifs. There are realistic and mythical animals. Some of the mythical animals are enclosed within palmettes. From the top, the realistic animals are (in pairs): large stag, hyena, cheetah/leopard, cheetah/leopard attacking buffalo, ibex, tigers, lion attacking spotted cow (? hoofed animal), cheetah/leopard, and (partially visible) wolf.\n\nMain border: white ground with large indented ogees containing elaborate palmettes, many of which are wreathed by a stem with large flowers. The ground is heavily decorated with floral stems and the ogees are connected by broad red strapwork, and are surrounded by at least four purple cloudbands.\n\nInner border: dark brown/blue (corroded) ground with a light green meander bearing predominantly yellow, green and red blossoms, and leaves.\n\nOuter border: red ground with an elongated double meander; one is dark blue outlined with white linking mainly orange and blue palmettes and the other is green and links sprays of light coloured flowers.",
