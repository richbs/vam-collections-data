He had a facility for inventing gadgets and this vaned copper screen is reminiscent of the copper shades he evolved for some of his lamps. The pattern appears in his catalogue of 1899/1900. It has the production number 679 and costs four guineas (\u00a34.20p).\n\nBenson was a great admirer of the designer and writer William Morris, who inspired him to set up a metalwork workshop in 1880. He later opened a well-equipped factory in Hammersmith, west London, and a shop in Bond Street. The firm survived until he retired in 1920. \n\nBenson\u2019s firm produced some simple furniture but his great output was well-designed utilitarian metalwork, usually in copper and brass (as here) but sometimes in electroplate. Benson had always been interested in engineering and, unlike so many of his contemporaries in the Arts and Crafts movement, had little compunction about the use of the machine.",
