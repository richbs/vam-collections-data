The \u2018carnation\u2019 - the flesh-coloured ground painted in the area of the face - has been laid down. Some of the features have been modelled over the carnation, using hatches of red and brown, but more detail is needed on the face and on the costume. Although Hilliard did paint members of Queen Elizabeth I's court, he also accepted commissions from customers who visited his shop in the City of London. Those of his sitters whose names are not inscribed on their miniatures are now virtually impossible to identify. This portrait demonstrates a simple alternative to the complex symbolism of many court portraits.",

Full citation:\n\n\u201cNICHOLAS HILLIARD\n\n<b>II Unknown Lady</b>, 1575-80\n\n<i>Victoria and Albert Museum (p.8-1947)</i>\nVellum stuck to a playing card with three spades showing at the reverse, oval, 39 x 32.5 mm, 1 9/16 x 1 9/32 in.\n\nBoth Reynolds and Auerbach date this miniature c. 1580. but the small ruff and closely dressed hair are more typical of the years before 1580.  Federigo Zuccaro\u2019s drawing of Elizabeth I dated 1575 is a very close parallel for dress (Strong <i>The English  Icon</i>, p. 164 (108)) as are a number of ladies by Gower (e.g. <i>ibid</i>, p. 174 (121)).  The oval shape, however, first appears in 1577 and the miniature could have been painted in France.\n\nV. J. Murrell suggests that this is not as has been assumed, an abandoned miniature but probably a demonstration piece kept in the studio.  The evidence for this, in particular, the carelessness in the preparation of the vellum which has been crudely trimmed and fails to reach the upper edge of the playing card upon which it has been mounted.  This latter would have obviated its possibility as a finished portrait.  Whether this is so or not the miniature gives us a vivid insight into Hilliard\u2019s working methods of the late 1570\u2019s.  It represents a state of completion which would probably have been achieved during the second sitting.  The modelling of the features over the carnation ground in transparent hatches of red and brown is not completed.  The hair has been loosely washed over the carnation ground to indicate its disposition, but it awaits more detailed linear treatment.  The ruff is almost complete; worked up with transparent grey over a white ground, and its lace raised in thick white.  The background has been taken only so far as the first thin wash of blue bice, and awaits the second, thick floating of that colour which would result in the dense, smooth and brilliant blue which was typical of sixteenth-century miniatures.  At this stage the costume has been indicated with dark lines of brown and black over the vellum, below which there are faint signs of graphite underdrawing.\n\nCOLLECTIONS:  Bequeathed by E.
