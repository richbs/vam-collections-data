Very Usefull to Painters, Sculptors, Stone-Carvers, Wood-Carvers, Silversmiths &c. published in 1736-1737. The whole design could be seen and copied with the aid of a mirror.\n\nDesigns & Designers\nGaetano Brunetti  (active 1731-1758) had designed and painted mural decorations at the town houses of the James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos, and Charles Bennet, 2nd Earl of Tankerville, and others in the early 1730s. As a kind of advertisement for his work, and a memorial of it, he provided designs for his book derived from ideas he had used in his mural paintings. This printed design could be adapted for two- or three-dimensional work in various media. A Rococo cartouche is, among other things, an elaborate and often fanciful decorative surround for an inscription, a title, or a picture, on objects as diverse as a book frontispiece or a silver cup. Prints like this one ensured the rapid dissemination of the Rococo style in Britain.",

Brunetti inv. et del. N. Fletcher Sculp.\nVAM (20329.8; E.295-1897)\n\nFrom Brunetti\u2019s Sixty Different Sorts of Ornaments\u2026 Very useful to painters, sculptors, stone-carvers, wood-carvers, silversmiths, etc. (61 plates and title-page, engraved by Fletcher and Jean Rocque). The publication proposal was advertised in 1736 (Daily Gazetteer, 28 June); the suites were delivered to subscribers in 1737 (Daily Post, 16 May). Some plates are dated February 1737 within the design. This single cartouche was copied, with several others from the suite, by Augustin Heckel (see Cat. H2) and by James Paine on the pediment of the Doncaster Mansion House, 1745-8 (Cat. M2) Other plates were used for a Dublin silver coffee-pot of 1737 (Ashmolean Museum), and in later contexts (Cat. B13). The suite appears in Rocque\u2019s list of publications dated 1742. J.M. Rysbrack\u2019s copy is at the Avery Library, New York (information from Peter Fuhring). Most of the plates are based on mural decoration (the Daily Gazetteer connected them with Brunetti\u2019s painting at the town houses of the Duke of Tankerville and other houses), but there are six plates of furniture designs. As in the present case, they are very reminiscent of contemporary Italian examples. A chair in a very similar plate from the suite was copied for Cat. B12. Brunetti, a Lombard, whose earliest English mural decoration was carried out 1730-31, worked in the north Italian style of quadratura. In 1739 he left England for Paris, where he died. Drawings for the suite are at Waddesdon Manor and the Ecole des beaux Arts, paris.\n\nLit: Berlin 1939, 587; Croft-Murray 1970, 176; Ward-Jackson 1958, 27\nMS\"\n",
