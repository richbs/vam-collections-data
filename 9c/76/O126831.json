Palmer \n \nAccording to A.H. Palmer in the 1926  \nexhibition catalogue, his father \u2018used  \nthese spectacles for nearly seventy years\u2019 \nand wore them for all his work. Possibly  \nthey are the pair he had on in the portrait  \nof him by Henry Walter of <i>c.</i>1835 (fig. 24,  \np.67), though the resemblance does not  \nappear exact. \n \nA.H. Palmer\u2019s claim that these  \nspectacles were used by Palmer for all his  \nwork differs somewhat from the earlier  \naccount of them in <i>Life and Letters</i>: \u2018A Pair  \nof old-fashioned silver spectacles with  \nvery broad rims was used for distant  \nobjects; but on state occasions aforesaid,  \nthese were exchanged for spectacles of  \nthe ordinary pattern\u2019 (<i>L&L</i>, p. 132).  \nAs Palmer was short-sighted, it would  \nnaturally be the case that he would wear  \nglasses particularly to study distances.  \nHe also appears to have entertained a  \ndialogue with his glasses, which seemed  \nat times to offer him an alternative  \nvision. In his lost sketchbook of 1823-4  \nhe wrote: \u2018The least bit of natural  \nscenery reflected from one of my  \nspectacle-glasses laughs me to scorn and  \nhisses at me\u2019 (<i>L&L</i>, p. 13). On another  \noccasion he blames his glasses for under- \nmining his amorous aspirations, by  \ndisguising the \u2018darting artillery of my  \neyes\u2019 (see cat. 52). \n \nIt was perhaps because of his obsession  \nwith glasses that Blake\u2019s widow gave  \nhim Blake\u2019s after the latter\u2019s death.  \nA.H. Palmer states that \u2018Blake\u2019s great,  \nround steel-rimmed glasses, bleared by  \nmany years of use, were among my  \nfather\u2019s very few personal treasures\u2019  \n(<i>L&L</i>, p. 132).'\n<u>Catalogue of an Exhibition of Drawings, Etchings & Woodcuts by Samuel Palmer and other Disciples of William Blake October 20 - December 31, 1926</u>.

Pair of silver spectacles in case, used by Samuel Palmer for nearly seventy years. \nWithout the aid of these spectacles for near sight he was helpless, so far as his occupations were concerned (he hated the gimcrack, genteel pair in which he was photographed); and through them he saw the \u201cValley of Vision.\u201d He alludes to parts of the Shoreham landscape reflected in one of his spectacle lenses as laughing him to scorn. Through them he saw Blake sign for him the extremely rare sheet of the Pastorals which is now placed on exhibition (See no.28). . . . Through them he gazed with almost equal enthusiasm at ancient Rome and the Villa D\u2019Este cypresses, which, afterwards, he so often reproduced. But it was not long before the bitterest sorrows and disillusionments of life . . . fell upon him, and so dimmed were these lenses by tears, that he could scarcely see his little dying daughter when she tried to put her arms around his neck. Years afterwards, when he was finally crushed by the still greater grief for the death of his elder son, and was living through a dreadful winter, he wrote: - \u201cI have been all day trying to see my work through tears.\u201d He was working on \u201cWrecked at Home.\u201d Without these spectacles he could not see the drawing clearly, and tears made them almost useless then, and often for many weeks afterwards. . . . His old nurse\u2019s spectacles I still possess. They are of a far older and rougher type; and they have this point of interest. Wearing them she fumbled for her own favourite passages in the little volumes (No. 16) now sent to the Museum. \u2013 A.H.P.  E.3979-1923. \nPresented by A. H. Palmer, Esq.'",
