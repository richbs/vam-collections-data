However, in keeping with English National Opera's policy of innovative productions, the opera was updated to the early 1960s as seen from 2000 (!) and  the action transferred to a film studios in Rome.  The costume was worn by Judith Howarth as Fiorilla, who in this production became a film star with an older film producer husband - the programme drew parallels between Sophia Loren and Carlo Ponti, but Fiorilla the character also drew on other major film stars of the period, including Ava Gardner, Anita Ekberg and Marilyn Monroe.  \nThe costume is beautifully made.  The sheath dress with the inset 'fan' of pleated silk at the back makes it easy for the singer to move; the fullness of the matching coat is created by double box-pleating of the top layer under which are complex stiffened net skirts and frills.",
