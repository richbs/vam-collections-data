            "physical_description": "A square-cornered miniature display and storage cabinet of carved red lacquer, with five asymmetrically arranged shelves, three drawers and a two-door cupboard at the lower right.\nA/B/C/D/E: shelves. F/G/H: drawers. I: doors\nThe rear of the cabinet is carved with an eight-point star diaper, framed by a band of 'huiwen'. The top is carved with 'yanglian' floral scrolling, framed by a band of eight-point star diaper. All edges of the top, sides and frames of the shelves, drawers and doors are carved with archaistic squared scrolling. The shelves are framed on all sides by edging carved with swirling cloulds. The side panels, door and drawer fronts are carved with figure subjects as follows: Left side: Tao Yuanming enjoying chrysanthemums. Right side: Su Shi's visit to Red Cliff. F: Two elderly figures seated on the ground by water. G: Boy greeting old man with staff. H: Writing an inscription on a cliff. I(left): Washing a 'tong' tree. I(right): two figures with a servant see an Immortal high up among rocks.\nThe insides of the shelves, drawers and cupboard are lacquered plain black. The drawer pulls, hinges and caps to the feet are in gilt metal. The narrow apron on all four sides is carved with a 'wan' diaper.\nCOMPARE: W.70-1935 exhibits many of the same technical features closely enough to possibly emanate from the same workshop.\n'Gugong qiqi tezhan mulu'(Taibei 1981) no.65 is a small cabinet in the Palace Museum, Taiwan, showing figure subjects identical with those on the left side and on I(right)m as well as a slightly different treatment of Su Shi's Red Cliff excursion. They possibly emanate from the same workshop, and strengthen the possibility that this example has palace associations, since the Taibei piece will almost certainly have come from the palace collection. This does not imply manufacture within the palace.\nPROVENANCE: from the Palmer Collection, with a traditional unsubstantiated provenance to the Summer Palace, Beijing.(cc 30/7/1984)",
