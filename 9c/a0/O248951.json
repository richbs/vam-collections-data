This was executed in the same technique and was said to be of c. 1792-3; the costume of the figures appeared to be consistent with this dating. No. 62 [280-1888] may therefore well be the earliest drawing by Constable in the collection, apart from the sketches of 1790 in the <i>Juvenile Introduction to History</i> described on p. 4.'\n'The Early Paintings and Drawings of John Constable', Graham Reynolds, Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art, Yale Universtiry Press New Haven and London, 1996, p.67\nThe following is an extract from the text of the entry:\n\n'Rosenthal has identified this drawing as a copy after Girtin's drawing of Guisborough Priory. Its dating has been the subject of some indecision. I first thought it was of c.1800-1805; in the second edition of my catalogue (Reynolds 1973) I imagined that comparison with No.95.5 (Reynolds 1996) implied an earlier dating in the 1790s. The discovery of the Girtin original, Loshak 430, shows that it cannot be earlier than 1801. It may be as late as 1805, when Constable's watercolour style shows his knowledge of Girtin's.'",
