The two females on the right,who are looking towards each other, appear to be holding sceptres in their two outer arms and a bunch of lotus blossoms and a circular object respectively in their other inner hands. The third female on the left has a damaged right hand, as well as an abraded face, as does the middle one. A chubby, winged putto stretches out at the corner to grasp an end of drapery.  Below him there is the top half of a figure in profile with an inclined head and damaged arms and hands which were probably formerly held together in adoration.",
