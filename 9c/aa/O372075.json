The polyester resin appears as if wrapped around the mould. The chair is characterised by wide overhangs.\nThe legs are a v-shape tapering up from the shorter sides of a triangular base. This shape gives the legs exceptional strength. The back two legs extend upwards to form a back support for a simple, slightly indented, rectangular back. The tapered legs, narrow at the base, reach the widest point at the height of the seat, the back support then narrows again towards the highest point of the chair. The front legs continue smoothly into the seat.\n \nThe edges of the chair are very distinctive and reveal the thickness of the chair. From the front the chair, the edges of the legs are directed outwards, whereas the edges that join the four legs curve inwards. From the back, a single, sharp edge is the main focus which is slightly turned outwards, because of the tapered back support. Looking at the chair from behind reveals the curved base of seat and back. The back appears as if it has been stretched out from seat and legs.\n\nThe chair was produced in eight colours, including yellow, black, red and blue, and is glossy in appearance.",

It was designed by Helmut B\u00e4tzner's architectural office during the 1960s in conjunction with the building project for the State Theatre in Karlsruhe (Germany). Plastic furniture was still a new venture and B\u00e4tzner, seeking advice, presented his idea to furniture manufacturer Bofinger. He became a powerful supporter of the project, eventually lending his name to the chair. The chair could be produced in only five minutes with little finishing needed. It was intended as additional seating indoors as well as for outdoor use and had to be light, moveable, stackable, compact and weatherproof. The chair's popularity is confirmed by a production of over 120,000 examples.",

            "bibliography": "Dunas, Peter, 100 Masterpieces from the Vitra Design Museum Collection (1996), p. 20 and pp. 46-47\n'Plastic reinforced with fiberglass had been commonly used in furniture ever since the late 1940s with the work of Eero Saarinen and Charles Eames. When he developed his \"Tulip Chair\" in 1956, Eero Saarinen has hoped one day to be able to produce this model completely in plastic. His desire for an all-plastic chair was shared by many designers, and throughout Europe research was initiated to accomplish this end.\n\nBut only in 1966 did architect Helmut B\u00e4tzner succeed in presenting the first mass-producable one-piece plastic chair at the furniture fair in Cologne.\nThis chair was developed in 1964 and 1965 in connection with construction work for the State Theatre in Karlsruhe for which B\u00e4tzner's architecture office was handling the planning. The chair was intended as additional seating for the experimental stages, foyer, caf\u00e9, canteen, and terrace area. Versatile use both indoors and out, as single or as row seating, called for special qualities: the chair had to be light, moveable, stackable, compact, linkable, and weatherproof. The material chosen was fibreglass-reinforced polyester. It was possible to guarantee stability of the legs, seats and back, with minimal materials inputs by opting for moulding. The special shape of the legs follows a double curve. After creating the optimal design in model form, Helmut B\u00e4tzner presented the idea to Bofinger, the well-known furniture manufacturer. Together they investigated possibilities for mass production and discovered a suitable partner in the Menzolit-Werke, Albert Schmidt. Since the mid-fifties, this company had specialized in the development, production, and processing of preimpregnated polyester resin mats, which among other things were used for molds in car body construction. Rudolf Baresel-Bofinger, the general manager of Bofinger KG, convinced the chair would be a success, signed a license agreement on January 14, 1966 with Helmut B\u00e4tzner and commissioned production of the double-shell heated iron ten-ton press. During the so-called \"prepreg-process\", in a single operating cycle lasting only five minutes a near-finished chair was produced. The polyester resin was stained throughout in eight colours and, because of the smooth surface of the press molds, chairs were created which required no further finishing (only the edges of the press seams had to be smoothed). In the same year as its introduction, the \"Bofinger Chair\" received the Rosenthal-Studio-Preis in the presence of Federal Chancellor Ludwig Erhard and the founding director of the Bauhaus, Walter Groupius. Designed as a relatively low-cost piece of furniture, the \"Bofinger Chair\" became an ideal seating for public places due to its minimal weight of only four kilos, its enormous stability, its weatherproofing and easy care. Its stackability was also remarkable - eight chairs to up merely one square meter. Altogether more than 120,000 chairs were produced. Millions of cheap plastic garden chairs with similarly shaped legs have duplicated this model in numerous variations.\n\nAt the end of 1994, there were attempts by the successors Baresel-Bofinger and the Habit Company factories in K\u00fcrten-Engeldorf, Germany, to manufacture to the \"Bofinger Chair\" using recycled material. The first examples were shown at the Cologne furniture fair in 1995.'\n\nModern Chairs 1918 - 1970 (Printed for the Whitechapel Art Gallery by Lund Humphries), p. 63.",

As an architect and  because of the novelty of the suggested material, B\u00e4tzner was seeking advice from the  renowned German furniture maker Rudolf Baresel-Bofinger (Bofinger AG) who enthusiastically  supported the project. On 14th of January 1966, Baresel-Bofinger signed a license agreement  with B\u00e4tzner and commissioned the production of the double-shell heated iron ten-ton press.\n\nThe chair was first presented at the Cologne Furniture Fair in 1966 and received the Rosenthal  Studio-Preis the same year.\n\nReinforced plastic had only been in use since the late 1940s by designers like Charles and Ray  Eames and it is reported that Eero Saarinen had hoped to be able to produce the 'Tulip Chair'  (designed 1956) one day completely in plastic. The desire for an all plastic chair was a strong  concern for many designers in this period and much research was directed towards  accomplishing this aim.\n\nDescription of Craftsman from Hollis, R. 1970. Modern Chairs:1918-1970. The Whitechapel Art Gallery, London:\nArchitect. Born 1928. Trained Stuttgart. Own office from 1960, Karlsruhe.

First prize IBM Office building, Berlin 1959; First prize Cologne University Library building 1960; First prize Karlsruhe Theatre building 1963.\n\nDescription of similar object from Hollis, R. 1970. Modern Chairs:1918-1970. The Whitechapel Art Gallery, London:\nOffered in five colours, these chairs can be pressed at the rate of one chair every four minutes. The model was included in the chairs exhibition at the Stedeljik Museum , Amsterdam in 1966, and the Musee des Arts Decoratifs, Paris in 1968. It received the Studio Rosenthal Prize in 1966.",
