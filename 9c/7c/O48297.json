            "history_note": "This Set design by Anthony Holland is part of an extensive collection of designs donated to the Theatre Museum by the artist in 1996.  The design was executed for a production of  Gaetano Donizetti's opera \"Torquato Tasso\" at the Collegiate Theatre,  Gordon Street, WC1 on February 27th, 1974.  The libretto was by Jacopo Ferretti.  The opera was produced by William Chappell, and staged by Opera Rara as part of the 1974 Camden Festival. This staging marked the first performance of the opera since it's last presentation in Italy, 1881.  The same production was later revived at the Camden Festival on February 22nd, 1975.\n\nHistorical significance: This production was the first staging of  Donizetti's opera \"Torquato Tasso\" since 1881, and is an example of the gradual critical reappraisal and popularity of Italian \"Bel Canto\" opera during the second half of the 20th century.  Donizetti was a supreme exponent of this style of romantic opera during the mid 19th century, and his tragic and comic works were highly popular until the emergence of the operas by Richard Wagner.  A re-examination of his work and exciting stage presentations (such as those performed by Maria Callas in \"Lucia di Lammermoor\" , \"Anna Bolena\", and \"Poliuto\" at La Scala) led to a much greater exposure of his talents in the opera house and concert hall during the late 20th century.  By the early 1970's, previously obscure works such as \"Maria Stuarda\" had become highly popular in Britain.",
