In a time before photography, many affluent people had miniature portraits painted. They were light and portable and could be given to friends or relatives, often in silk-lined leather carrying cases made specially for them.\n\nCharles Kemble performed as a child but was briefly a civil servant in his teens.  He returned to the stage however in 1794 and made his London debut aaged seventeen as Malcolm in Macbeth, produced by John Philip Kemble at Drury Lane Theatre.  Never a great tragedian like Sarah and John Philip, he made his name in roles such as Orlando, Young Absolute, Charles Surface, Benedick and Romeo. He took over the management of Covent Garden from John Philip in 1817 and was rescued from bankruptcy in 1829 when his daughter Frances Anne, or Fanny, performed there.  From 1832 until 1834 they pefromed together on a tour of North America where he was appreciated as a typical English gentleman. From 1834 until 1845 Fanny was married to Pierce Butler of Philadelphia, which may be why this miniature was in America until it was acquired by the Theatre Museum.",
