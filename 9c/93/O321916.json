The central decorative feature of these panels, is a floriated lobed scrollwork carved in relief. Behind this is a carved strapwork also carved in relief. Each panel is carved with a different design. \nThe other four panels are made from a dark wood (possibly ebony). They have been inlaid with fragments of ivory. The ivory pieces form geometric designs on the surface of the wooden panels. They are different in style from the other eight panels and probably date from a later period.",

They were probably made during the fourteenth century. They date to the Mamluk period (1250-1517), and they have been carved in two levels of relief. The second set of panels is formed from four plaques. These are representative of a later period of Egyptian inlay. They are un-carved and Ottoman in style. They probably date to the sixteenth century (1500-1600). They were acquired by the museum in 1869 from a collection of items owned by Dr Meymar, a collector of Mamluk art who lived in Cairo during the latter half of the nineteenth century.",

            "history_note": "This object is formed from two sets of minbar (Islamic pulpit) panels.  The eight hexagonal panels probably date from the fourteenth century. The carved relief design is highly representative of Mamluk minbar panel design. The other four panels date from the sixteenth century. They are representative of Ottoman carving styles in Egypt. They have been constructed from un-carved ivory and dark wood (possibly ebony) fragments. These have been inlaid in a geometric style. Each of these panels would have formed part of the complex inlaid surface of the minbar. \n\nThe wooden mount is a later addition which was added when the object entered a private collection. It probably dates to the late 19th century. This object formed part of the Meymar collection \u2013 a collection of Islamic and Middle Eastern objects collected by the Turkish bureaucrat known as Dr Meymar who was based in Cairo in the 1860s.This collection was exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1867, from where the South Kensington Museum (V&A) made a large number of purchases to enhance their growing collection of Islamic art. Together with the collection of Gaston de Saint-Maurice (accessioned in 1884), the Meymar collection was the foundational collection of \u2018Saracenic\u2019 art \u2013 or the art of the Mamluks (ruled Egypt and Syria 1250-1517A.D) \u2013 in this museum.",
