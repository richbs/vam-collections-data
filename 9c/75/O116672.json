            "public_access_description": "This necklace, with its gold chain of interlocking scales, is an Indian adaptation of the serpent jewellery that was popular in early Victorian England and was probably made in about 1850. An English serpent necklace or bracelet would usually fasten by looping the articulated scaly body over the reptile's head. On this piece, the chain is in two sections, each terminating in a wolf head. The teeth of each head are enamelled in white, the ears in red, and the eyes are set with rubies. They hold rings between their teeth to which are linked spheres covered with pave-set pearls separated by minute gold granules. Between the pearl-set spheres is a single sphere set with turquoises in the same technique. The clasp is a hook that loops into a ring set on a swivel post. \nThe necklace was acquired by the Indian Museum in London in 1855 and was transferred to the South Kensington Museum, later renamed the Victoria and Albert Museum, in 1879.",

ISBN 0 85488 047 X\nNecklace\nBengal [Presidency], probably Calcutta/ first half of 19th century\nGold, three balls decorated with pave-set pearls and turquoises, linked between two canine heads. Details on heads, red and white enamel, with ruby eyes.\nAcquired 1855, possibly from the Exposition Universelle, Paris.\nThis necklet is very close in style to the serpent necklaces and bracelets popular in early Victorian England. The incongruous placing of the head of a dog or wolf on the sinuous serpent body, represented by interlocking scales, suggests the fashion came from Europe and was adapted in India. English jewellers' catalogues were circulated in the Calcutta goldsmiths shops producing a degeneration of local styles deplored by contemporary writers.\nCf.Flower [1951] p.17-18 and fig.14b and O'Day [1974] pl.3.",
