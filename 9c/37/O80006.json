Silver filigree buttons had been synonymous with rural dress since at least the 16th century.  Most European cultures disapproved of male jewellery, but buttons allowed men to show off their wealth and status.  They wore them in extravagant numbers, on sleeves and trousers as well as jackets and waistcoats. \n\nLinks, or pairs of buttons joined together by a loop of metal, were one of the oldest kinds.  They were originally worn at the throat, to close the shirt opening.  Later they were worn at the cuff, and this is the commonest use today.\n\nThis link comes from Dalmatia, and was probably worn as a cuff-link.  The filigree work on the front of the buttons, and the loop between them, which is squeezed in the centre, are both typical of Dalmatian silver work of the 19th century.",
