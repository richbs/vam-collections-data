The support in front is carved with strapwork, terminal figures, masks, etc. with a shield of arms in the centre, described by Pollen as 'argent and gules, per fess, over all a cross ancr\u00e9 of the tinctures of the field counter-changed' (two tau crosses, one inverted over the other, painted in red and white). The back is fan-shaped, with perforated acanthus scrollwork, flanked by terminal figures and surmounted by two sphinxes forming a pediment.\n\nThe back is fitted to the seat using the three vertical mouldings which pass through the seat and are wedged. The chair is heavy and the joints generally tight. Possibly constructed using old seats and fronts. Gesso is visible below the gilding.\n\nCondition (1/2006)\nThe back feet tipped. The reverse of the back leg is coarsely carved, and thinner (29mm) than that on 5686-1859 (36mm). There are variations between the two chairs in the guilloche moulding running below the seat - one more tightly carved than the other. The seat with a circular dish seems old, with plausible movement and worm damage. Replaced elements appear to be: turned stretcher, both side rails below the seat, the crest (which is sharp given its exposed position). Note that there is very damage to the exposed carving of the back.\n\nThe chair was described by Robinson (1856) as made of chestnut, but Pollen (1874) correctly says walnut, verified (1988) by Jo Darrah.",

They were often highly ornately carved, and would have been very uncomfortable to sit on without a thick cushion, held in position by a circular dished area carved into the seat. This sgabello formed part of a set that belonged to Jules Soulages (1803-1856), a lawyer from Toulouse. His collection was bought piecemeal by this museum, after being exhibited at Marlborough House between December 1856 and January 1857. Many pieces, including this example, were heavily restored, or made up of a mixture of old and new pieces.",
