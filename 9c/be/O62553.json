            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nThe movement of this spring-driven, striking table clock  has been extensively altered, probably in the late 17th century. Its base-plate is signed by David Ramsay, but some of the later alterations to the clock were done by the French clockmaker Louis David. A brass plate bearing his name covers Ramsay's signature. The case is likely to have been imported from France, since French clocks of this period have the same square base and domed bell-cover pierced with openwork.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nOn the base is an engraved scene showing James I, with his two sons Henry and Charles, holding the Pope's nose to a grindstone. On the right a Cardinal and three friars view the proceedings with dismay. The scene is taken from a German engraving and was inspired by the settlement made in 1609 between Spain and the Estates General of the Netherlands. The settlement was  regarded as a great blow to papal power since it was an alliance between a Roman Catholic and a Protestant state. The clock must have been made shortly afterwards, when the issue was still topical.\n\nPeople\nDavid Ramsay came originally from Dundee and worked in France and London. He was appointed 'Watchmaker and Constructor of  horologes to His Majesty King James I' in 1613 and was the first Master of the Clockmakers' Company in 1632. He died in about 1654.",
