An outer ring shows the figures of the seven Liberal Arts alternating with the Virtues and the gifts of the Holy Spirit. The seated men in the corners represent the four wise men of Antiquity: Ovid, Boethius, Horace and Aristotle. Numerous inscriptions in Latin refer to the figures.\n\nThe inscription on the double band enclosing the outer ring is taken from works by Saint Bernard of Clairvaux. The name of the prioress, 'D[omi]na Elisabet', the date 1516 and the names of 58 nuns appear on the two outermost bands.The border inscription also lists the Augustinian canons Arnold Stenwick, Anton Colhof and Heinrich Hovensse.",

It is an example of excellent craftsmanship. The subject embroidered reveals the theological and classical education received in a nunnery on the eve of the Reformation. All the inscriptions refer to the christianization of classical learning. \n\nEmbroidery was a usual occupation for nuns. The entire convent was evidently involved in making this hanging as their 58 names appear on the outer band. The addition of these names suggests that the nuns expected future generations of canonesses to remember them in their commemorative prayers.",

It is an example of excellent craftsmanship and of the theological and classical education in a nunnery on the eve of the Reformation. The annals of the convent for the year 1516 recorded the tapestry: Item eodem anno ward ock geneiget de grote tapet philosphia. \n\n<i>Design and inscriptions</i> \nThe design of the embroidery was probably based on a twelfth-century model, since it does not provide a narrative scene and neglects completely any perspective.The inscription on the double band enclosing the outer ring is taken from works by Saint Bernard of Clairvaux. All the inscriptions reflect the christianization of classical learning. The name of the prioress, 'D[omi]na Elisabet', the date 1516 and the names of 58 nuns appear on the two outermost bands. The naming of the nuns is quite exceptional although embroidery was a typical occupation for them; it means not only that the entire convent was involved in making this hanging, but also that they expected that future generations of canonesses should remember them in their commemorative prayers. The border inscription also lists their spiritual mentors, the Augustinian canons Arnold Stenwick, Anton Colhof and Heinrich Hovensse. \n\n<i>The nunnery in context</i> \n\tThe Heiningen nunnery was established in 1013 to commemorate its founders, Hildeswid and Alburgis, and provide a spiritual home for the unmarried daughters of aristocrats. From the twelfth century onwards, nunneries in Lower Saxony as well as on \nthe Middle and Upper Rhine had become centres of embroidering and weaving textiles, mainly for religious purposes. By about 1260, an embroidered altar frontal (now in the Marienberg convent in Helmstedt) had already been made in Heiningen featuring Hildeswid and Alburgis. \n\nIn 1517 the convent embarked on another wallhanging that was finished two years later. The central section originally depicted the figures of Ecclesia (the Church) and Synagogue surrounded by Sibyls. It was also duly recorded in the annals, identified by these last figures: 1517 ward geneyhet de tapet myt den Sibellen (in 1517 the hanging with the Sibyls was stitched).",
