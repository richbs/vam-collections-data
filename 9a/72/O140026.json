This albumen print, a type of photograph commonly made in the 1860s and 1870s from a glass negative, was made in the photographic studio in the factory building of Skidmore's Art Manufactures and Constructive Iron Co. at Alma Street, Coventry.  It is by an unknown photographer for the firm of the leading Victorian metalworker Francis Skidmore, (1817-1896).  This photograph is a record of the completed work and forms part of the Skidmore design archive. This could be the arch for a choir screen. It has similarities with the arch of the Salisbury Cathedral screen made by Skidmore while working with Sir George Gilbert Scott (1811-1878) on a restoration project there in1869-1870. The screen in this photograph, however, is less elaborate which suggests that it was for a parish church.  Now little known, Skidmore was once famous as the maker of the Albert Memorial (1863-1876) and the Hereford Screen (which was exhibited in London at the International Exhibition of 1862).   Scott designed both the memorial and the screen and employed Skidmore to execute them.",
