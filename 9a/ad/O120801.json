It acted as instructions for the weaver about how to tie up the threads on the loom and then weave in the pattern. It is similar to a group of designs commissioned by a silk manufacturing partnership active in Lyon \u2014 the most prestigious centre of the silk industry in Europe from the 1660s onwards \u2014 and corresponds in style to the 1760s when patterns were curvaceous. The partnership was called L. Galy, Gallien et cie from 1761 until the beginning of 1771 when the senior partner Louis Galy retired. This company was one of Lyon\u2019s 400 manufacturing concerns mid century and it kept good records, noting on the back of the designs the number of the design and minimal instructions on how it should be woven.\n\nDecisions about the way it was to be woven were obviously altered during the design process or at some later date; the first set of instructions has been scored out and replaced by new instructions. The first set aimed at making this into a cannel\u00e9, a silk with a ribbed effect in its background whereas the second set were for a smooth plain weave, a taffeta. The width of the fabric was approximately 54 centimetres. In Lyon, manufacturing regulations dictated the widths in which such silks might be woven.",

            "history_note": "The paper on which this design is painted reveals its origins in Lyon, centre of the French silk industry in the 18th century. It belongs to a group of thirty-one designs with similar motifs acquired by the V&A in 1972; they all date to the decade between 1761 and 1771. The manufacturer who commissioned this particular design is not known, but may have been L. Galy, Gallien et cie., active in Lyons from 1759-1771 when the firm became L. Galy et cie. At a later date, the designs belonged to the designer Robert Ruepp (b. 1854) whose address was 7 rue Berg\u00e8re in Paris and who exhibited silks of extreme Art Nouveau design at the International Exhibition there in 1900 and other rather less original designs in 1925.  They passed into the hands of Sir Frank Warner, head of the famed English silk manufacturing firm, from the archive of which, part being sold at auction, the V&A acquired them in 1972.",
