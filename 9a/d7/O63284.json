            "history_note": "The print depicts Carlotta Grisi as Giselle the Wili in the second act of Jules Perrot's ballet Giselle, which she created at the Paris Opera in 1841 and danced in London in 1842.  As the sky is flushed pink, the print may represent the dawn, when the wilis return to their graves.  Grisi's performance of Giselle in the second act was her supreme interpretation and she sometimes appeared in this act alone.  Reviews of the ballet describe how Giselle appeared to Albrecht 'now suspended in the air', which could indicate the use of flying sequences, although these could have been executed by a double, given that the ballerina is unlikely to have worn a flying harness throughout the act.  \nThe inscription on the reverse of the print, which may have been made by the original framer, links the print to Deryck Lynham, the dance researcher and historian and may have been given by him, or his widow, to the London Archives of the Dance.  The Archives never achieved an independent home and part of the collection was  stored with Cyril Beaumont, where it became inextricably mixed with his own collection and came to the Museum as part of the Cyril Beaumont Bequest.",
