This particular episode involves his mission to the Mon capital of Pegu to escort the princess Manisanda who is to be sent as \"a gift of gratitude\" to Anawratha of Pagan.\nCaptions in modern Burmese script help to explain the episodes:\nLeft top - Kyansittha confronts the gilded barrier which screens the princess Manisanda from the attentions of the men accompanying the mission.\nCentre top - Kyansittha opens the barrier enclosing Manisanda and asks the three traditional questions of ceremony.\nRight top - The four generals (which includes Kyansittha) are seen returning from Pegu.\nCentre right - The four generals arrive at the city of Pauk-kan (Pagan).\nCentre middle - Ministers (of Pagan) welcoming the four generals.\nCentre left - King Anawrahta questions Manisanda (she is now pregnant by Kyansittha).\n\nIt is expressed in a variation of the nan-dwin (King at Court design) where the story is shown in a series of palace pavillions in which the figures are dressed in Mandalay Court Costumes.\nFacial features are uniquely detailed and some are red and some white - an indicator of rank. Hairstyles also indicate rank and silver has been used representationally.",
