            "public_access_description": "Archie Brennan is credited with bringing about a renaissance in tapestry weaving and design in Britain.  He trained as an apprentice tapestry weaver at the Edinburgh Tapestry Company, subsequently known as the Dovecot Studios.  In 1958 he left to study at Edinburgh College of Art, returning to the Dovecot where he became head weaver and resident designer and artistic director from 1962-1978.  In 1962 Brennan also established and developed the tapestry department in Edinburgh College of Art.  Brennan's work is renowned for its humorous and decorative qualities, and often focuses on pattern and repetition.  At a Window 1 illustrates Brennan's fascination with the idea of weaving an image of a patterned textile.  The curtain, floor, dress and background tapestry are all highly pattened featuring spots, repeating squares and zigzags.  It was woven under the direction of Fiona Mathison, who succeeded Brennan as artistic director of the Dovecot Studios in 1978.",
