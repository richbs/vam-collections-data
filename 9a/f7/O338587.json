Sir Arthur Steel Maitland from La Paz in 1921\" (Bolivia)\n\nHistorical significance: The development of the Nasca style over seven centuries has been divided into different periods. Decoration became more elaborate, more graphic and less naturalistic after the early period. The curious pattern here of alternating red and brown mythical creatures with either a single or a pair of eyes round the top half of this cup relate to common Nasca motifs of radiating elements and proliferations around a single eye, or around the face of a mythical being. On the bottom half, the stylised cactus pendant decoration may refer to the hallucinogenic drink made from the San Pedro cactus, perhaps suggesting a liquid it would have contained.",

Vessels were formed by coiling, drawing and shaping by direct modelling rather than the use of moulds. When the clay was nearly dry the surface was carefully burnished with a smooth stone or similar tool before firing to produce a smooth and shiny surface. Nasca decoration is characterised by skilled polychrome slip painting. Blocks of coloured slips were painted using brushes made from Llama or Alpaca fur and then the distinctive black outlines of the image were added on top.",
