Lady Alexandra to Cecil Beaton, 10 October 1971\nDear Cecil,\nI have been meaning to tell you about a rather beautiful Jacques Fath evening dress that I would be willing to give to your exhibition.  I though it was too late but then I read in today's papers that you are still getting additions.  The dress is white satin with agate coloured embroidery.  I first wore it for the visit to Paris of Princess Elizabeth (as she then was) in 1948 or 49 (I forget which) - It does not sound as if you have any models by Jacques Fath.  I have several of that date, both day and evening.  This particular dress is here in Scotland.\nTrevor-Roper, Lady Alexandra, 'Memoirs' (Unpublished; Family Collection).\np. 331\u2026 The great excitement was the visit of HRH Princess Elizabeth and HRH the Duke of Edinburgh to Paris.  They arrived at the Embassy on May 14 [1948] and stayed until the 18th.  I was lent some lovely dresses by Fath to supplement the ones I already had.  I seemed always to be changing my dress in a great hurry.  There was a dinner at the Embassy on the second night and according to a newspaper cutting I \"was in an outstanding full-skirted dress of orchid coloured tulle with a strapless top\"\u2026 p.332\u2026 The most vivid memory I have is the dinner party at the Embassy on May 17th, the last night.  I had a wonderful Jacques Fath dress made of white satin with layers of satin at the back like a bustle and amber-coloured embroidery on the front of the bodice.  When we and various members of the Embassy were waiting before dinner, Hilda Salisbury-Jones [the wife of the Army Attach\u00e9] touched the back of my dress and there was a rustle.  She put her hand under one of the loops of satin and pulled out a lot of tissue paper.  That was a signal for everyone to pull out more and more tissue paper.  In the middle the Royal couple came in and were highly amused.  It broke the ice of the evening.  After dinner we were all going to the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre National de L'Opera for a special gala in honour of the Royal guests.  When Johnny and I arrived at the opera house and started to climb the marble staircase which was lined by the Garde Nationale when they suddenly sprang to attention and I realised they had mistaken us for the Princess and the Duke.  I hurried up the stairs as fast as my dress would allow, feeling very self-conscious.  That was the effect made by my splendid Fath dress which is now in the Victoria and Albert Museum as I have given it to the costume department together with my other Fath and pre-war Schiaparelli dresses.\nLynn, E., 'Lady Alexandra' in Wilcox, C., ed., <i>The Golden Age of Couture: Paris and London 1947-57</i> (V&A Publications, 2007), p.172 and pl. 7.18 (image of Lady Alexandra wearing the dress).",
