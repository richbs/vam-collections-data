Of all those who are partial to rowing, who would not join when the opportunity for a gay sailing regatta offers?\n2-6 persons can participate in the game. The players put their boats at the start on the drawn number: for they may only advance on the course the number of which was drawn by lot. Now the players flip the end of the arrow on the spinner in turn and move according to the number gained. Each player advances as many squares along his course as he has gained points. When he reaches a square before an obstacle, for instance 17, he must stop before it. Using but one die he can only take the obstacle, when the spots of the throw agree with the number of his course. \nHe who reaches the goal first is the victor and receives 2/3 of the pool, the next two share the rest. \n\nNo. 19/123 E.'",

After choosing a course, players take turns to move their painted metal yachts around the board, spinning certain numbers to overcome obstacles, in the hope of winning the prize pool.\n\nThe race format was popularised in eighteenth and nineteenth century board games, and the Museum's collection includes many examples where players move their pieces towards an established end point on the board. These early games often had a moral message, or a lesson to be learned on the way. In this Regatta game, however, the moral lessons have been replaced with joy in leisure and the vicissitudes of pure chance.",
