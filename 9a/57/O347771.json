This figure was commissioned anonymously by Sir James M. Barrie, the author of Peter Pan, and secretly erected on 29th and 30th April 1912, so that its appearance the next day would seem magical, and perpetuate the Peter Pan enigma.\n\nPeter Pan is the main character of the story The Adventures of Peter Pan by J. M. Barrie. The story is of a boy who refuses to grow up and creates his own world of Indians, pirates, and fairies. Peter Pan was produced for the stage in 1904 but appeared as a narrative story only in 1911.\n\nSir George James Frampton (1860-1928) was an English sculptor, medallist and decorative artist. He worked in an architects office before being apprenticed to a firm of architectural masons. He studied modelling a the London School of Art under W.S. Frith, and in 1881 entered the Royal Academy  Schools, where he won a gold medal and travelling scholarship in 1887. Like Lanteri he was involved in the exterior decoration of the Museum, executing the spandrel reliefs of Truth and Beauty above the Main Entrance.\nFrampton was elected an Associate Member of the Royal Academy in 1894 and exhibited regularly across Europe, contributing to the Munich and Vienna Secession movements.",
