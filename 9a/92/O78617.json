Rosewater or other sweet-scented warm water was most commonly used for this purpose. From the 13th century, throughout Europe, a marine theme was considered most appropriate for the decoration of a ewer and basin.\n\nThe ewer from this set is probably that now in the Kremlin Armouries, Moscow.\n\nHistory & Use\nEwers and basins played an important role in the ceremonial life of the court and were frequently exchanged as ambassadorial or New Year gifts. Sets were usually the grandest items on display on the buffet, or sideboard table. They were made in gold, silver-gilt or plain silver. The great amount of precious metal meant that the acquisition of a ewer and basin represented a considerable financial expenditure and thus emphasised the status of the owner. \n\nSubject & Style\nThis set is typical of the Mannerist style so fashionable at the Jacobean court. The style had originated in the mid 16th century in the courts of mainland Europe. It was characterised by highly sophisticated and fantastical forms executed in the most precious materials.",
