They have features of animals, either of the horse or the goat. Satyrs are usually young and have Pan's goat details (in contrast to the rather old Sileni with horse ears). They were the attendants of Bacchus. They were lazy and lecherous and spent their time drinking and chasing nymphs. In medieval and Renaissance allegory they represent the evil or rather 'Lust' and may be labelled 'Luxuria' or 'Libido'.\nRiccio (1470-1532) - meaning 'Curly-Head' - worked primarily in bronze and is acknowledged as the master of the bronze statuette during the late 15th and early 16th centuries. He was active in the humanist circle of the University of Padua, in north-east Italy. Riccio was trained as a goldsmith and lived and worked all his live in Padua. Today he is acknowledged as one of the greatest bronze sculptors of the Renaissance.\nHis statuettes, functional objects, like oil lamps, and reliefs reflect Riccio's inimitable ability to express the most refined humanist ideas prevalent in the Veneto in bronze.\nHe was also a specialist in rendering themes of Classical mythology.\nHis oeuvre is often neglected because of its small scale, but it constitutes one of the most fascinating manifestations of the poetic paganism of the High Renaissance.",
