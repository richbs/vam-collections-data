Its French counterpart usually had only eleven. Both were tuned in the key of D minor, but the German version had loud ringing bass notes, required for the new extrovert 'galant' style of music, fashionable both in solo and chamber music in about 1734, when this instrument was made. At that time, the leading composers for this instrument were Johann Sebastian Bach (1685 - 1750) and his contemporary Silvius Leopold Weiss (1686 - 1750).",
