He had a  young family:  Prince Henry (1594-1612), who was his heir, Prince Charles (1600-1649) and Princess Elizabeth (1596-1662). James embraced portraiture as a way to promote the new Stuart dynasty. During this reign, there was a massive proliferation of miniature portraits of members of the Royal Family.\n\nPeople\nPrince Charles was the second son of James I. He became heir to the throne on 6 November 1612, on the death of his older brother, Henry, Prince of Wales. He was then only  12 years of age.  Charles, who had been Duke of York, was invested as Prince of Wales in 1616.  He ascended the throne as Charles I in 1625. In 1649, after years of civil war, he was executed by the victorious  Parliamentary forces.\n\nThis miniature was painted from life by Nicholas Hilliard  (possibly born in 1547, died 1619).  Prince Charles wears the blue ribbon and Lesser George of the Order of the Garter. An English order of knighthood, the Garter traditionally comprises the Sovereign and 25 Knights Companions. Thie miniature was painted after May 1611, when Charles received the Garter. It  could have been painted to celebrate the event. Charles did not have his own court at this date and so sat for Hilliard, his father's limner (an old term for miniaturist).",

The back of the card has been overpainted with bands of opaque pink and green watercolour, oval, 51 x 41 mm, 2 x 1 5/8 in.\n\nAlthough faded, a superb <i>ad vivum</i> likeness of the young Charles I.  He wears the Lesser George of the Order of the Garter with which he was invested in May 1611.  It must therefore be after that date but precede Hilliard\u2019s portrait of 1614 at Belvoir (Auerbach, <i>Hilliard</i>, pl. 158).  It is tempting to associate it with the payment to Hilliard for a portrait of the Prince on November 3rd 1613 (Toynbee cited P.R.O. Declared Accounts Roll 544, f.32).  In composition it is strongly reminiscent, as Reynolds has pointed out, of two other miniatures; of James (no. 235 [P.3-1937]) and Elizabeth of Bohemia (no.247 [P.4-1937)) which both depict the sitters in light coloured costumes against crimson velvet curtains.  It differs from them, however, in the introduction of a decorative border of patterned gold over smalt (blue), a compositional innovation of precisely this period.  It is basically in good condition, although the background and jewel in the hat have craquelured and the silver oxidized\n\nFramed at an early date with miniatures of James I, Anne of Denmark, Prince Henry, Frederick, Elector Palatine and Elizabeth of Bohemia (Auerbach, <i>Hilliard</i>, pl. 160).\n\nCOLLECTIONS: On a label on the back of the frame is written: \u201c<i>Sheriff Hutton Park / 23rd July 1866 / Miniatures by Isaac Oliver / Family of King James 1st/ Leonard Thompson</i>\u201d; George Lowther Thompson, Sheriff HUTTON Park; sold Christie\u2019s 5th July 1894 (lot 65); bequeathed by George Salting, 1911.\n\nLITERATURE: V&A, 1947 (89).\nMargaret Toynbee, \u201cSome Early Portraits of Charles I\u201d, <i>Burlington Magazine</i>, XCI, 1949, p. 14.\nReynolds, <i>Walpole Society</i>, XXXIV, 1958, no.
