The hand would almost certainly have been used as a model, although no marble versions on monuments corresponding to it have been identified. It could alternatively have served as an example for students and assistants to copy. The Roubiliac sale from which these may have been purchased contained a number of anatomical models, including arms, legs, and knees.\n\nLouis Fran\u00e7ois Roubiliac (1702-1762) was one of the leading sculptors of his generation, and his busts and monuments are among the most important produced in Britain in the first half of the 18th century. He was born in Lyons, and probably trained in Dresden. He was later in Paris, but from 1730 he was based in London, apart from a brief visit to Rome in 1752.",
