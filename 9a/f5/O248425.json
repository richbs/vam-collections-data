The carved crest of bow shape with scrolled ends is in two parts (glued together), the upper element apparently reused from another chair, and is tenoned into the rear uprights which rake backwards slightly above the seat. The plain lower back rail is tenoned into the rear uprights, which are turned with blocks at the joints and turned vases on top. The back cane panel is contained within the crest and the lower back rail, and two plain uprights. The seat frame (side rails tenoned into front rail), which is possibly replacment, sits on the front legs, and the side and rear rails are tenoned into the rear uprights. (Pegs are visible on the outer faces of the block in the rear uprights, and where side stretchers meet the rear legs.)\n\nReplacement parts: turned central stretcher (fits poorly where it is jointed to the side stretches); back stretcher; front left leg (copying original front right leg). Back left foot patched in. Caning(?). Modern blocks have been added under the back feet.",
