They became extremely popular not only among the aristocracy and gentry, but also with merchants and tradesmen, as they were much cheaper than upholstered chairs. By the 1680s tens of thousands were being made in London every year, for export as well as for home consumption. Those that were exported also inspired imitations, and this type, carved  with crowns around the back and on the front stretcher, became particularly popular in the Netherlands and Scandinavia.",
