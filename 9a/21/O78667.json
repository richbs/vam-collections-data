            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nA miniature is so-called because of its watercolour technique, not because of its size.   These two miniatures are unusual in being painted as a pair. Both are inscribed in gold 'Ano Dm 1590' ('The year of Our Lord 1590').  One is inscribed 'Aetatis Suae 4' ('aged 4'), the other 'Aetatis Suae 5' ('aged 5').   Although the dresses of the two children are alike, it is notable that their ruffs are in different styles.  The younger child does not smile and holds an apple.  The elder has a slight smile, holds a carnation and wears a ring on the fourth finger of the left hand.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nWhen these miniatures were painted, only the well off could afford to have portraits painted.  We do not know who these children were, but we may assume that they were sisters and that they came from a wealthy family.  Isaac Oliver (about 1558-1617) introduced distinguishing elements into these very similar images: the apple and carnation, the frown and the smile.  It is possible that these symbols  had a personal meaning for the family who commissioned the portraits, and they may not have been the artist's idea.  In many paintings an apple (the fruit that Eve took from the tree of knowledge in the Garden of Eden) stood for the biblical story of the  Fall of Man.  A carnation symbolised the Virgin Mary, the mother of Jesus Christ.  But how these applied to these two girls is now unclear.  The significance or otherwise of the ring is also unknown.",

V&A P.146-1910\n\nThese two charming portraits of young sisters were among eighty miniatures acquired with the George Salting bequest in 1910. This bequest effectively established the V&A as the collection of miniatures. The National Gallery received Salting's \"\"pictures\"\" and the British Museum his \"\"drawings\"\" but public opinion was divided about whether miniatures should be categorised as pictures or drawings. The V&A's own 1908 committee on Re-arrangement argued that miniatures had \"\"no relation to applied art\"\" and thus no place at the V&A. (Significantly and perhaps defiantly, it was in 1908 that the V&A published the first catalogue of miniatures.)\nIn fact, the V&A had long played an active role in promoting the importance of miniature painting in the history of English art. An 1859 Museum catalogue devoted to \"\"pictures\"\" (but ironically, including no miniatures) stated that \"\"from the earliest time there was one branch of art in which English artists had a reputation even on the continent.... [And] excelled other nations, namely miniature painting in watercolours.\"\" By the 1850s the invention of photography had all but destroyed the contemporary miniature, but the history of miniature painting began to be nostalgically reappraised, led by the V&A. Without precedent, \"\"antiquarian\"\" miniatures figured prominently in an 1862 loan exhibition at the Museum. Their popularity led in 1865 to an extraordinary loan exhibition of nearly four-thousand miniatures (including Queen Elizabeth I, cat.122).\nThe acquisition of the Salting bequest was seen as the moment to settle Museum policy regarding miniatures. Salting's collection unofficially established the V&A as the primary institution for the collecting of miniatures and for research on this subject. The Museum also houses the National Collection of Watercolours, which has subtly influenced the collecting and interpretation of miniatures. Within the V&A miniatures took their place as early forms of watercolour painting, as an integral part of what was seen as an essentially English tradition. \nA specific outcome of this research was the rejection of the earlier attribution of this pair of miniatures to Levina Teerlinc, and the pair's acceptance as two of the earliest surviving works of Isaac Oliver, one of the foremost English miniature painters. Later discussion has drawn attention to the symbolic if enigmatic, significance of the apple and carnation, the figures' frowning and smiling expressions, and the possible dynastic meanings of these portraits of children, so rare before the eighteenth century.\n\nLit.Williamson, 1904, addendum, p.xx; V&A , 1926, p.46; Strong,1983, p.102; V&A, 1985a, pp.44-5\n\nKATHERINE COOMBS\"\n<u>100 Great Paintings in The Victoria & Albert Museum</u>.

Salting Bequest.  \n\nPortraits of infants before the 18th century are very rare, and these two little girls must therefore have been of  some great dynastic importance in the English body politic of 1590. At this date miniature painting was still an art  restricted to a very narrow circle around the person of the sovereign, a highly educated \u00e9lite of state officers and  courtiers, including their professional advisers and suppliers of cultural services. \n\nThe portraiture of both Hilliard and Oliver was, as far as we can see, exclusively concerned with this group, and  within it, it is usually possible to distinguish by their dress and by the make-up of the portrait the grandees from  the professionals. These children were emphatically grandees. \n\nThe rarity of strongly individualized child portraits is largely accounted for by the high rates of infant mortality  which seems to have inhibited the sort of emotional bonds between parents and their off-spring that seem natural  to us. The portrait is a badge of inclusion in a society, proclaiming membership of a household and a place in the  wider world. Until children could be relied upon to survive, investment of emotional and material resources in their  future seems to have been kept to an economic minimum. The changeover to the modern approach was long  drawn out over the 17th and 18th centuries, culminating in the cult of impassioned grief at the death of children  recognizable in much 19th-century fiction.\n\nThis progresses more or less step by step with the Enlightenment, with advances in practical science and with a  broad cultural attentiveness to the mores of marriage and family life. The process, as a phenomenon with real  political impetus, begins with the emergence in government of the Protestant rationalist \u00e9lite under Elizabeth I.  The two little girls were presumably scions of this \u00e9lite, and Oliver, whose work is often distinguishable by the  vigorous naturalism of the facial modelling, has endowed each of them with a convincing and characterful  presence. The pink and the apple, symbols in Christian iconography of the Virgin and the Fall, are puzzling in this  context. They perhaps make some more temporary or anecdotal allusion, reinforcing the personal quality of the  images. \n\nThe attribution of the miniatures has an amusing history. Male art historians and connoisseurs, possibly influenced  by the idea that children were women's business, started the notion that the portraits were by Levina Teerlinc,  then a shadowy figure known only from the records of payments to her in the royal accounts. In the 1930s Simone  Bergmans, a Belgian scholar, studied the two miniatures and another of similar date which she 'proved' was a self- portrait of Teerlinc. After the war, Carl Winter applied the techniques of style-analysis to the miniatures and  argued cogently that they were by Isaac Oliver, and Erna Auerbach seemed to have settled the matter by her  discovery that Levina Teerlinc had died in 1576. In ignorance of all this, however, Eleanor Tufts in a book called Our  Hidden Heritage  (New York, 1974) used the miniature to exemplify the theory that male dominated art history had  systematically expropriated the achievements of female artists and attributed their greatest works to men. Since  then the question has come up every time a new academic course or public exhibition on Women Artists has been  planned.\n\nJohn Murdoch\"\nStrong, Roy. <u>Artists of the Tudor Court: the Portrait Miniature Rediscovered 1520-1620.</u>.

These are amongst Oliver\u2019s earliest surviving miniatures and already establish him as an artist whose range and approach was to be much more varied and complex than Hilliard,  Miniatures of children, other than royal ones, are of the utmost rarity and the two girls must have been of exceptional status.  Williamson, not an infallible source, states that when there were in the possession of C. H. T. Hawkins they had with them a slip of paper stating that they were painted at Greenwich in 1590 (Williamson, <i>Catalogue, 1906</i>, I, p. 20).  Salting, who bequeathed them to the V&A had never seen this piece of paper, if, indeed, it ever existed.\n\nJustifiably, these miniatures quickly established themselves as two of Oliver\u2019s most popular works.\n\nINSCRIBED: (P.145-1910): On either side of the head: <i>Ano Dni. 1590 / AEtatis Suae. 5.</i> (P.146-1910): On either side of the head: <i>Ano Dni. 1590. / AEtatis Suae. 4.</i>\n\nCOLLECTIONS: C.
