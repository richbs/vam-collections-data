Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. Above all, they had to have the means for attaching a cord. Netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated being the katabori (shape carving), a three-dimensional carving, such as this one in the form of a dragon coiled round a dead tree.\nThis netsuke depicts two of the three imperial regalia of Japan. In the dragon's front claw and tail are the sword and the jewel but the depiction lacks the third imperial item, the mirror. In Japanese mythology the sword was discovered in a dragon's tail by the storm-god Susanoo. The hollow trunk of the tree in this netsuke is ideal to pass through the cord to attach the object to the inro.",
