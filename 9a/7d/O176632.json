The mother holds out gloved hands to the girl, who wears a brown striped gown, and is being led towards her by a young woman (probably a mistress) wearing a pale blue open gown with scissors hanging from her waist.  The girl is also greeted by a younger boy in a dark blue skeleton suit and red sash, who has apparently thrown his hobby horse and hat on the floor as he runs up to her with a peach from the mother's basket.  Two other girls, presumably also pupils, are standing in the garden just beyond the open doorway.",

            "public_access_description": "At this date it was by no means taken for granted that a girl would receive more than a very basic education, even in a wealthy family.  Aside from charity school pupils (clearly not the case here), sending her away to boarding school was even more unusual.  It possibly suggests that this child is from a family which has gone up in the world and wishes to demonstrate its wealth, as well as introducing her to girls of more established families who will be useful social contacts for her later in life.\n\nThe Wallace Collection, which contains the original painting, suggests on its website that the girl is the same child who was being visited at her wet nurse's cottage in Morland's painting 'A Visit to the Child at Nurse', and from which Ward also made a mezzotint (see Misc.709-1992).",
