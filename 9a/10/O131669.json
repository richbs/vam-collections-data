The melody would be played on keys, and a rotating wheel would supply a background drone, by rubbing the strings like a violin bow. But during the 18th century a hankering after the simple life amongst certain French aristocrats and richer members of the bourgeoisie helped make this instrument more fashionable. This elaborately decorated example was made by the Paris-based luthier Varquain. He was famous for making guitar-shaped hurdy-gurdies, known as vielles en guitare, no doubt having such customers in mind.",
