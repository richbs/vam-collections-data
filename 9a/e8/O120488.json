            "public_access_description": "Stars of the 19th century theatre were often celebrated in paintings, prints and drawings, and in ceramic figurines. Several Staffordshire factories specialised in moulded earthenware portrait figurines which were decorated by hand and sold cheaply. This represents the American actor James Henry Hackett (1870-1871) as Falstaff. Hackett made his first appearance in 1826 and became famous for his portrayal of Yankee characters.  He came to London as a star in 1833 and made his name playing several Yankee characters including Rip Van Winkle, and also Falstaff.\n\nThe pose was copied from an engraving published in Tallis's Shakespeare Gallery, 1852-1853, showing Falstaff  in Act 4, scene 2 of Henry IV Part 1, standing in the open air. At least seven earthenware portrait figurines are known to have been copied from this source and are known as Tallis figures.  They were made in many sizes, probably by by the Burslem potters Thomas Parr (who was working from 1852 until 1870), John Parr, (working from 1870 to 1879), or the Kent & Parr firm, (working from 1880 until 1894). These manufacturers passed the moulds to each other and the figures were produced throughout the Victorian period. This piece was made in two sizes, of virtually identical design, and it was re-cast throughout the century.  This appears to be a late model due to its minimal colouring.",
