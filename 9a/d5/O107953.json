Of the Nilang Pass shown here he wrote: 'I never beheld such a splendid array of peaks and glaciers; they cropped up on either side, and stood thick around me like icebergs in a polar sea. And as I stood on the crest of the Pass and surveyed this vast region held in the icy fetters of eternal winter, I could not but feel deeply impressed with the sublimity and majesty of nature when beheld in scenes like these.\u2019",
