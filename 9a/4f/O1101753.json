H, p. 20, no. 66 (Charles H); Foskett 1974, pp. 77, 124 (now identified as James H); <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 9 (thought to be <i>James as Duke of York</i>). \n\nA MS note of 1949 by Jonathan Mayne first records the suggestion that the portrait, rather than being of Charles II, is of James II as a young man, citing the portrait by Cooper at Windsor (1) in comparison. There is also some resemblance between the sitter in this miniature and the sitter identified as the young James in the miniature belonging to the Hon. Felicity Samuel. (2) But the latter has a background of shipwreck or fighting at sea and by analogy with the portrait of Algernon Perey, 10th Earl of Northumberland, Lord High Admiral, after Van Dyck (Cat. No. 62), this formula should refer to James's appointment as Lord High Admiral in May 1660, when he was a man of twenty-seven. In the Samuel miniature, the sitter wears a Garter ribbon: James was invested KG as an infant in 1642, and is appropriately shown wearing the insignia. The sitter for this miniature does not wear the ribbon. \n\nFurthermore, the certain portrait of James (Cat. No. 85) Signed and dated 1661, and thus of a date close to that of this miniature, raises doubt as to the likeness. James evidently had by this time a more adult, elongated face, with a deeply cleft chin, his hair neatly parted and not allowed to stray in tails across his forehead (see also James as a child, aged about seven, in the triple portrait attributed to Hoskins at the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge). The sitter for this miniature seems too young to be the experienced soldier, sailor and courtier who came back to London in his brother's suite at the Restoration in 1660, and who is represented as such in Cat. No. 85. \n\nAn alternative suggestion that the sitter could be Prince Henry- (1639/40-1660), the fourth but third surviving son of Charles I, who was said to resemble his elder brother James very strongly - founders because he too should be shown wearing the Garter ribbon at this date, having been invested KG at The Hague in 1653. \n\n1 Cust 1910,no. 123. \n2 NPG 1974, no. 105.\u201d\n",
