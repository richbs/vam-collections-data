Instead, the medium was used almost solely for heraldic panels. As in previous centuries, patrons of religious foundations often commissioned windows displaying their coats of arms as a means of reaffirming their association and commemorating their generosity.\n\nPeople\nThe inscription reveals that this panel was commissioned in 1582 by Edward Lucas to adorn the chapel of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. According to an 18th-century source, the college possessed two panels bearing his arms. This one seems to have been removed from Corpus Christi around 1828 when the chapel's windows were being restored by Samuel Yarrington, who sold the piece. It was acquired by the V&A from Filby Hall in Norfolk, the home of Charles Lucas, who was apparently descended from another, non-aristocratic Lucas family.\n\nMaterials & Making\nWith the widespread introduction of enamel pigments in the 16th-century, true stained glass played a diminishing part in the production of heraldic panels. Instead, larger panels of white glass were painted with colours and this work fell chiefly to Dutch and German artists. In the scrollwork border of this panel, blue, red and black enamel is used alongside silver-based yellow stain. The shield itself has been made using a different technique called 'flashing', whereby clear glass was coated with a thin surface layer of red glass, which was then scratched or 'abraded' to reveal the white detail beneath.",
