Embossing is a method where metal is hand cut and pressed\non dampened paper, moulding the paper to create the image. \n\n\nDesign & Designing  \n\n\nLarge, elaborate memorial cards such as this became popular in the\nVictorian era. They were designed to be framed and hung on the wall by\nrelatives and friends of the deceased. The majority of mourning cards\nwere quite small but elaborately embossed: they were produced in large\nnumbers by printers and the appropriate name could then be added later.\nThe V&A collection includes examples of blank cards. Embossing was used\nin a wide range of Victorian stationery: greetings cards, admission\ntickets and so on. During this period, the technique reached new levels\nof sophistication, with an almost 3-D sculptural quality.",
