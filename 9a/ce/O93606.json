It is very finely engraved with images from the life of Christ. Dutch silversmiths of the 17th century were famous for the quality of their engraving, the designs often taken from contemporary prints or paintings.\nEngravers use a steel-cutting tool called a burin or graver to carve a thin sliver of metal from the surface of an object. A professional engraver will have a large number of gravers, each suited to a particular task. Engraving, unlike other techniques used to decorate silver such as chasing or embossing, removes some of the metal from the object during the process",
