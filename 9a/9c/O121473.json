The underarm seam on the garment body is also left open for approximately 11 cm.\nThe design, on pale blue silk cr\u00eape is denser on the bottom half of the kimono. It consists of blossoms, fans, tasseled and ribboned flower bouquets and lengths of patterned textile (possibly kimono) over stands, all against clouds. The techniques used are resist-dyeing and painting (probably both <i>yuzen</i> and stencil resist) and embroidery (including polychrome untwisted silk straight stitches, knot stitch, stem stitch, laid gold work couched down with small stitches and also padded and decoratively couched, and plaited silk couched down).",

The design was created using a technique called yuzen. This involves drawing the pattern on the cloth with rice paste extruded through the metal tip of a cloth bag. The paste forms a protective coat that prevents the colour penetrating when the dyes are applied. Here the skills of the dyer have been enhanced by those of the embroider, who has highlighted the stand and the edges of the fabrics in gold and added flowers, blossoms and elaborate ties and tassels in pink, white and green.",
