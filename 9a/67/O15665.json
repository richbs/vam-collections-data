The silk twill has a woven repeating pattern of rearing horses in two shades of blue. Their saddles, manes and plumes are picked out in metallic thread. \n\nThe jacket was originally worn with a dark purple cr\u00eape evening dress with a draped hem. The ensemble formed part of Schiaparelli's Circus collection of 1938. It has been described as the most riotous and swaggering fashion show that Paris had ever seen. It had a million novelty effects, including prancing dogs and horses, grey elephants, spotlit acrobats, tents and clowns. \n\nSchiaparelli commissioned extravagant and decorative buttons for her distinctive outfits. These handmade, cast metal acrobats are full of vitality and humour. Brass screws attach the heavy buttons through the cloth on to industrial slide hooks. This was an extremely novel fastening. Other unusual buttons in Schiaparelli's fashion ranges included feathers, locks, paperweights, chains, animals and lollipops.",
