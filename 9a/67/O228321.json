Italian goldsmiths were expert at making a little material go a very long way.  The garnets in this necklace have been backed with red metallic foil to improve their colour.  Red and gold are the dominant colours in Italian traditional jewellery.\n\nThe design of this necklace is typical of traditional jewellery from central Italy.  Although complete necklaces are rare, many women would have worn earrings of this pattern, and matching pendant crosses hung from a decorative ribbon.\n\nThis necklace was bought for \u00a318 as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
