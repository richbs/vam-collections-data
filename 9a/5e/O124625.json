Attended the Academy of Music in Hanover Square from about 1843 to 1846, when he studied painting with his elder brother George (1822-1909). In 1854 settled in Cranbrook, Kent, with Thomas Webster (to whom he was related) and others; they came to be known as the Cranbrook Colony, specialising in rural genre painting. Exhibited 93 works at the RA between 1851 and 1898, and five at the BI 1851-56, all scenes of cottage life, sometimes humorous. His pictures of children engaged in adult pursuits were especially popular. Died Cranbrook 1 April 1911.\n \nLIT:  <i>Art Journal</i> 1875, pp73-6; A Greg <i>The Cranbrook Colony</i> exhibition catalogue Wolverhampton Art Gallery 1977\n\n<b>Cottage Interior</b> \nFI5 \nMillboard, 19.7 x 29.8 cm (7\u00be x 11\u00be ins) \nSigned and dated 'F D H 1852' on edge of table \nForster Bequest 1876 \n\nPresumably the 'Interior from Nature' offered in a letter of 12 July 1852 from the artist to John Forster (V&A Library, Forster Collection, MSS vol XL, no 3). The next letter (no 4) of 26 July 1852, in speaking of a 'second commission', implies that Forster bought this 'Interior' and that it can be identified with F15. A third letter (no 5) of 30 July 1853 refers to 'your Picture' being in the 1853 RA exhibition; it is impossible to say for certain whether it was this work or F16 (see below), but if the former, it could have been 'An Interior' (270), or 'The Labourer's Home' (533). The <i>Art Journal</i> (1853, p145) described 270 as 'A back kitchen, or something like it, every brick of which is signalised - but the picture is spiritless for want of a point of light'. \n\nAccording to the artist's statement in 1907 both F15 and F16 were painted in the neighbourhood of Snell's Wood, near Chenies, Buckinghamshire. \n\nThe work has previously been catalogued as 'Still-life', a misleading title in view of its subject although it does not contain any figures, except for a sleeping cat. \n\nEXH: ?RA 1853 (270 or 533); <i>The Cranbrook Colony</i> Wolverhampton Art Gallery 1977\"\ned.
