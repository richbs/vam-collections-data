This example and its pair (352A-1870) are in the form of classical vases. Items made in the Neo-classical style of the 1780s were popular as antiques after about 1860. These examples were made as fakes, between 1860 and 1870, but the Museum believed they were genuine when it bought them in 1870.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe knife-cases are decorated with marquetry of several woods, including holly, sycamore, harewood, ebony and boxwood. The tops of the cases lift up on a central rod to reveal compartments lined with velvet to hold knives.\n\nPeople\nThe Museum bought these knife-cases from Murray Marks (1840-1918), a well-known London antique dealer, on the recommendation of Sir Matthew Digby Wyatt (1805-1877), an eminent architect of his day. Wyatt regarded this pair as 'very elegant in all respects, difficult and good in workmanship'.\n\nTime\nAbout 1860, when these knife-cases were made, furniture veneered in pale wood and marquetry, imitating the style of designs by the 18th-century architect Robert Adam (1728-1792), was fashionable. For example, the London cabinet-making firm Wright and Mansfield exhibited new furniture veneered in such woods at international exhibitions in the 1860s and 1870s. The firm described such furniture as 'Adams style'.",
