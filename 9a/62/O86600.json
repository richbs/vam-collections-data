From about 1130 the whole of the Bible had a gloss, which Gilbert de la Por\u00e9e (ca.1080-1154) further revised for the Psalms and the Epistles of St Paul. Copies of his gloss have the page layout found in this leaf and another four in the V&A collection from the same manuscript, with the gloss written out continuously and the biblical text in a larger script put at the appropriate place alongside. In 1142 Gilbert became Bishop of Poitiers in western France, where his works were copied in books that were decorated in local styles. The V&A leaves are among these. The designs of the initials are of a kind found in manuscripts produced at this time in such centres as Limoges, Angoul\u00eame and Moissac. The neat interlace of the initial, and even the colour scheme with a bright green and rich red, are in a totally different idiom from Paris work of this date. The style indicates a date in the mid-12th century or shortly after, which suggests that it represents textual tradition supervised by Gilbert himself.",

From about 1130, the whole of the Bible had a gloss; Gilbert de la Por\u00e9e (ca. 1080-1154) further revised the gloss for the Psalms and the Epistles of St Paul. Copies of his gloss have the page layout found in the V&A leaves, with the gloss written out continuously and the biblical text in a larger script put at the appropriate place alongside. This arrangement seems rather clumsy when compared the the alternate-line layout that characterized glossed books produced in Paris, but it was consistently followed for Gilbert's text throughout Europe. \n\nBefore the establishment of the university in Paris at the end of the twelfth century, study and teaching centred on outstanding scholars bases in cathedral schools - Laon, Chartres and Paris among others - where books were produced to record their teaching. After ca. 1160 Paris came to predominate as a centre of teaching and book production, but before this date books were produced in cathedral towns: their design and decoration established the standard for the text in question. It has been argued that the books produced in the circle of Gilbert in Chartres were copied in all their aspects when this scholar migrated to Paris (this has been difficult to prove since the library at Chartres was totally destroyed in 1944), so that the first Paris copies were in fact imitations of Chartres books and their illumination.\n\nWhen Gilbert went to Poitiers in 1142, howeverm his works were copied in books that were decorated in local styles. The V&A leaves are among these. The designs of the initials are of a kind found in manuscripts produced at this time in such centres as Limoges, Angoul\u00eame and Moissac. The neat interlace of the initial, and even the colour scheme with a bright green and rich red are in a totally different idiom from Paris works of this date. The style indicates a date in the mid-twelfth century or shortly after, which suggests that it represents textual tradition supervised by Gilbert himself.\n\nText taken from Watson, Rowan. <u>Illuminated manuscripts and their makers</u>. London, 2002.\n\n<u>Caroline or Carolingian Miniscule script (Littera Miniscula Caroline)</u>\n\nNo other medieval reform of script, or rather canonization of an evolved script, was as far-reaching and sytematic as that of Caroline miniscule. Its successful diffusion throughout much of early medieval Europe was closely linked to an increase in intellectual activity based on the dissemination of texts, partly due to the emperor Charlemagne's promotion of scholarship and education. Heightened royal, noble and ecclesiastical patronage of book production from the late-eigth-century onwards, and the adoption of Caroline miniscule by the religious foundations and ecclesiastical institutions which were largley responsible for book production at this time, were also key factors in the success of this script. \n\nDiffusion: most of Western Europe from eighth century until eleventh to thirteenth depending on the region. \n\nTaken from Brown, Michelle P. <u>A Guide to Western Historical Scripts from Antiquity to 1600</u>.
