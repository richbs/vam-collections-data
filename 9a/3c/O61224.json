The use of plain oak,  with chamfers around the back and stumpy columns for the legs and stretchers, show that the designer, William White (1825-1900), was inspired by the theories of A.W.N. Pugin, the Gothic architect. White established his architectural practice in Truro, Cornwall, in 1847. In 1849 he was commissioned by Rev. Samuel Edmund Walker, Rector of the parish of St. Columb Major, Cornwall, to replace the existing dilapidated Rectory with a new building. White included such innovations as a fire-proof staircase made of granite in the new Rectory, finished in 1851 and praised as a model of domestic religious architecture in The Ecclesiologist. He used similar geometric designs for the stained glass windows and for the inlaid back of the chair, one of a set he designed for the Rectory.",
