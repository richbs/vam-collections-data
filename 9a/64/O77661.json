He specialised in cavalry scenes and was active in Antwerp from 1720, where he was a member of the Guild of St Luke. \n\nA companion piece to 548-1870 showing an episode of warfare probably during the war against the Turks declared in 1715. The costume of part of the soldiers indicates they are Saracens or Turks and the whole scene looks more like an ambush rather than a proper battle. Characteristics of Jan Pieter van Bredael are the lively colours and the relatively loose brushwork. The majority of his compositions show generic ambushes and skirmishes quite difficult to relate to any precise battle.",

London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, p. 46-47, cat. no. 47\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"Jan Pieter van BREDAEL (1683-1735) \n<i>Flemish School</i> \nBorn at Antwerp, the son of the painter Joris van Bredael, he settled in Prague in 1706 to work for Prince Eugene, for whom he painted battle- and hunting-scenes. After returning to Antwerp in 1720 he was recalled by Prince Eugene to work in Vienna, where he lived until his death in 1735. \n\n47 \nCAVALRY ENGAGEMENT AGAINST TURKS, \nWITH A DISTANT VIEW OF A TOWN \nSigned indistinctly lower right \n<i>..... Bredael</i> \n<i>Oak panel</i> \n9\u00bc x 13 (23.5 x 33) \n547-1870\n\nCompanion piece to 548-1870 (no. 48). A label on the back bears the inscription in Parsons' hand: 'In the Dresden Catalogue 1857 are pictures by Jan Frans Bredael, pupil of Wouverman born 1683 at Amsterdam died 1751 at the same place. This picture is signed 'Bredael' at right hand corner and is by the same artist. In Bryant's dictionary a name is given John van Breda born Antwerp 1683 d. Antwerp 1750, no doubt the same person is meant in both cases. bt. of Watson 10th June 1856.' \n     However, although Jan Frans van Bredael (1686-1750) painted some battle scenes of this kind, these paintings are more like the work of Jan Pieter van Bredael, who specialized in depicting cavalry engagements. Apart from stylistic considerations, his authorship is attested by the Turkish costume of the dead, wounded and fleeing soldiers in both pictures: Jan Pieter was in Prague from 1706 painting battle pieces for Prince Eugene, including scenes of his victories over the Turks (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna). \n\n<i>Prov.</i> Bought by John Parsons from Watson in 1856; bequeathed to the Museum in 1870.\"",

            "history_note": "Bequeathed by John M. Parsons, 1870\nJohn Meeson Parsons (1798-1870), art collector, was born in Newport, Shropshire.  He later settled in London, and became a member of the stock exchange.  His interest in railways led to his election as an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1839, and he was director or chairman of two railway companies between 1843 and 1848.  Much of his time however was spent collecting pictures and works of art.  In his will he offered his collection of mostly German and Dutch schools to the National Gallery (which selected only three works) and to the Department of Science and Art at South Kensington, later the Victoria and Albert Museum.  The South Kensington Museum acquired ninety-two oil paintings and forty-seven watercolours.  A number of engravings were also left to the British Museum.\n\nHistorical significance: Jan Pieter van Bredael depicted a large number of battles scenes, especially showing scenes of the military campaigns of Prince Eugene of Savoy to which he was attached as a court painter. The small size of this painting and his companion piece, <i>Cavalry engagement against the Turks with a church in the background</i> (548-1870), is typical of the style of the Haarlem painter Philips Wourwerman (1619-1668) that produced many small cabinet pictures depicting generic battle scenes. \nAt the beginning of the 18th century, the Turks under Sultan Ahmet III were still trying to extend their empire westwards, although back in the mid-1680s they had failed to take Vienna in a famous siege. War was declared against Austria again in 1715, and in the following years Prince Eugene of Savoy fought a number of successful battles against them. Peace was signed in 1718 with the Treaty of Passarowitch, and Hungary was thereby liberated from Turkish rule. The Turks, although no longer led into battle by the Sultan in person, had stuck to their once formidable traditional methods of warfare. These became progressively less effective against forces led by modern generals such as Prince Eugene.\nComparative works by Jan Peter van Bredael such as the <i>Battle of Petervardino</i> and the <i>Battle of belgrado</i> can be found in the Kunsthisthorisches Museum of Vienna.",

            "historical_context_note": "In Italy the classical tradition of battles scenes goes back to the Roman low-reliefs and mosaics such as the <i>Victory of Alexander the Great on Darius</i> in Pompeii, and persisted in medieval miniatures, in the 14th and 15th centuries' frescoes and in decorations on the Renaissance cassoni (i.e. wedding chests) up to such works as Pietro da Cortona's <i>Victory of Alexander over Darius,</i> 1635, Museo Capitolino, Rome, and Salvator Rosa's <i>Battle Scene,</i> 1652,  Louvre, Paris). In the 17th century however, Aniello Falcone, perhaps the first Italian battle specialist, introduced a new category of small battle, the battle scene 'without a hero' (F. Saxl) and usually without a specific topic beyond a generalized study of cavalry skirmishes between generic Christians and exotically clad Saracens or Turks. This speciality was developed by Neapolitan artists such as Carlo Coppola, Andrea di Lione and Salvator Rosa and in Florence by Giacomo Cortese. In the Netherlands, following the recent episodes of war that marked the progressive independence of the Low Countries (Eighty Years' War 1568-1648), Philips Wouwerman (1619-1668) painted generic skirmishes and ambushes (using northern settings, clothing and weapons) and he concentrated on genre scenes of crowded camp life. Tapestries also allowed this genre to develop and were now used as official military art and formed high-class mass production. In Rome, the Bamboccianti, i.e. Netehrlandish followers of Pieter van Laer nicknamed Bamboccio, were particularly interested in this genre.",
