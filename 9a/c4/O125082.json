Holmes, p. 239. who did not know of the date on the canvas, which was not recorded in the <i>Inventory of Art Objects 1888</i>, assigns the paintings to the year 1804 on grounds of style. [...]\n\n\nNote on Nos. 36, 37, 39 and 40\n\nIn the letter of 29 May 1802 to Dunthorne which contains the first systematic formulation of his artistic faith, Constable says (L. ed. S., p. 21) \"For these two past years I have been running after pictures and seeking the truth at secondhand. I have ... endeavoured to make my performances look as if really executed by other men ... I shall shortly return to Bergholt where I shall make some laborious studies from nature -  and I shall endeavour to get a pure and unaffected representation of the scenes that may employ me with respect to Colour particularly and anything else - drawing I am prety well master of. - There is little or nothing in the [Royal Academy] exhibition worth looking up to. <i>There is room enough for a natural painture</i> (Some commentators have interpreted this as a nonce-word for \"style of painting\"; but in the same letter, as transcribed by Shirley, Constable refers to \"a good painture\" and \"the French painture\" where he can only mean \"painter\" by the noun.) Nos. 36, 37 and 39 which bear dates July, September and October 1802, and perhaps also No. 40, are among the fruits of this resolve. They are recognised as the paintings in which Constable's true bent first expresses itself, and the first auguries of his forthcoming excellence in the realistic interpretation of Nature. In the following year four works by Constable were accepted for the Royal Academy exhibition, his greatest official success in this decade. Two of them were listed as 'A Study from Nature', and two as 'A Landscape'. Although their late numbers in the Academy catalogue indicate that two or three may have been drawings, there is a possibility that on one more of Nos. 36, 37, 39 and 40 may have been among those exhibited in 1803. In any event these sketches may have been among those which Constable showed Farington on 23 March 1803: \"Constable called & brought several small studies which He painted from nature in the neighbourhood of Dedham\" (Greig, Vol. II, p. 88). A painting of similar type, 'The Vale of Dedham', is reproduced in the <i>Connoisseur</i>, Vol. CII, 1938, p. 323.\nEvans, M., with N. Costaras and C. Richardson, <u>John Constable.
