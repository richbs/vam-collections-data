The coffee pot was then electroplated. The Journal of Art and Design in 1850 praised its 'well finished and smooth, bright surfaces'. The outer skin has become worn from excessive cleaning during use.\nJames Dixon and Sons started primarily as Britannia metalsmiths but by the mid 19th-century produced silver, Sheffield plate, nickel silver, Britannia metal and electroplate. Despite being at the forefront of industrial reform in the 1820s, operating one of the first steam powered rolling mills in Sheffield, they initially contracted out their electroplating to Walker and Coulson. It was not until 1848 that they applied to Elkingtons for a licence to 'meet with spirit the electroplating in Sheffield.'\n\nSilver City Exhibition RF.2006/131\n\nHistorical significance: James Dixon and Sons were renowned for their work in Britannia metal. In 1851, they received two prize medals at the Great Exhibition. It was said that their exhibits in Britannia metal so closely resembled sterling silver that they were recommended to place over them the words 'Britannia metal goods'.\nBritannia metal was a cheaper substitute for sterling silver.",
