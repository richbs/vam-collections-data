He specilaised in genre scenes involving musicians.\n\nThis work is a fine example of the paintings produced in Munich in the second half of the 19th century, one of the main artistic centres in Germany along with D\u00fcsseldorf. The present painting shows a quintet rehearsal, a subject matter Piltz seems to have particularly favoured. The earthen palette and subject matter are characteristic of the realist movement emerged in the 1840s and influential throughout the century. Compare with similar compositions, this painting probably dates from the 1890s.",

Munich school of painting developed, from the 21860s onwards, an art based on the style of 17th-century Dutch and Spanish portraiture, genre painting and history painting while taking in account the most innovative technique of the century. Although the present subject matter is not particularly Dutch or Spanish, it may be considered as an adaptation of the Dutch genre picture to the 19th-century daily life. This group of musicians are characterised by their outfits and the interior setting, which echoes the social reality of the 19th century. \nMunich paintings are usually made in a minimal, bright, chromatic palette while the portraits and genre scenes appear in a manner that was clearly less dramatic and sentimental when compared with the preceding D\u00fcsseldorf school. \nMost of Piltz's oeuvre can be found in private collections and the V&A is probably the only British public institutions to own an example of his work.",
