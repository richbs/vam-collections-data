Having worked as a  commercial photographer, he is conscious of  what he calls \"the pervasive technological- consumerist culture\". In response to this, along  with other artists of his generation such as Garry Fabian Miller and Susan Derges, he has returned  to the simplest photographic means: photography without the use of a camera. Such  procedures recall the earliest photographs of the 1830s and 1840s. This work was inspired by Fuss' visit to a Shaker community where he was impressed with their hand-built ladders. It also references William Blake's work 'I want, I want' showing a figure holding a ladder up to the stars, as well as the famous ladder in Henry Fox Talbot's 'The Haystack'. Imbued with a poignant sensibility, or the implication of transcendent aspirations, Fuss' works resound with metaphysical meaning.",
