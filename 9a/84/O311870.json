The reverse side shows a mother with a child in her arms alongside a boy carrying wood. This is a detail from Gainsborough's 'The Wood Gatherers', in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. \n\nThis piece is one of a series of medals produced by the Art Union of London which was founded in 1837 to encourage interest in the fine arts. Between 1842 and 1887, they sponsored a group of thirty medals, each with a portrait of an eminent artist, together with an illustration of their work. This medal was commissioned from Henry Weigall in 1855 and completed by Ortner in 1858.",
