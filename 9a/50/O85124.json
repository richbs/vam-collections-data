The blue border has been stitched to the red centre.\nDisplayed behind glass.\nThe central triangular panel has a red ground with a gold lion outlined with red in the centre; the lion's mouth is open and the tongue extended.  The upper half of the sun is behind the lion's back.  It is silver with gold pointed rays, all outlined with red and each point is separated by a fine red line.  Two red locks of hair fall from a point above the forehead of the sun; they fall over the lion's back and curl outwards.  Between the eyes, the nose is formed by the same red line as the eyebrows. There is a gold and red disc in the middle of the brow. The pattern ground is rather clumsily interrupted by the lion and sun and the edges are abrupt although the designer/weaver did manage to get some floral stems around the lion's feet. The ground appears to be silver divided into a lattice.  The bands of the lattice are decorated with a fine red stem, leaves and flowers.  The lattice forms slightly lobed hexagons with a red ground and an inscription in silver.  The inscriptions are in bands and there are 4 different bands.\nThe broad border is mitred at the corners; it is very wrinkled along the upper edge - WHY?\nThere are three bands:\n[1] silver ground with a fine blue meander linking a diagonal leaf and a 4-petalled flower either side of a wider silver band with a flowing inscription.\n[2] wide band, silver ground with lobed blue cartouches with 3 different inscriptions alternating with a 4-lobed compartment with 3 different inscriptions.  There is a partial rosette in blue between these compartments.\n[3] as [1].",
