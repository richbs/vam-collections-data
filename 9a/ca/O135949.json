This figure comprises parts of several different figures - head, limbs and torso - assembled and then cast as a single figure. \n\nThis figure is related to Rodin's studies for Iris, Messenger of the Gods, which was intended to surmount a second but uncompleted version of the monument to Victor Hugo commissioned in 1891. The head, limbs and torso, however, were originally completely separate, pre-existing elements. The fusion of these separately conceived pieces disturbs the equilibrium of the sculpture and creates a sense of dynamic unease.\n\nThe head exists in an enlarged form in the Mus\u00e9e Rodin, with the title of Large Head for Iris, though it was also called Head of Demeter. A cast of the enlarged version was also given to the V&A as part of Rodin's 1914 gift (See Head of Iris, Museum no. A.41-1914).",
