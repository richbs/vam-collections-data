            "history_note": "Purchased, 1887\n\nHistorical significance: Stephen Elmer (bap.1715-d.1796), worked as a still-life painter. Elmer's father painted murals at St. Andrew's Church, Farnham, Surrey. Stephen trained in his studio where he began depicting dead game. He was a member of the Free Society of Artists and exhibited 113 pictures there between 1768 and 1772. In 1772 he was elected associate of the Royal Academy. He exhibited 117 paintings there over the next 25 years. Elmer specialised in animals, including birds and fish, as well as flower and fruit pieces. These are painted in a free style that reflects works of Flemish artists such as Jan Fyt (1611-1661). Elmer produced paintings of prize game and in this field was compared to the leading animal painter of the eighteenth century, George Stubbs (1724-1806). Elmer also worked as a portrait artist. Throughout his life he lived and worked in his native Farnham. \n\nFive fish are placed in the foreground of this painting. The fish can be identified as freshwater species, including the rainbow trout which lies at the front of the group. Beyond this still life a mountainous landscape stretches back towards the horizon. Trees with foliage painted in loose downward strokes frame the painting. Throughout his career Elmer specialised in animal subjects, including fish. The composition of animals in the foreground of a vast landscape recurs in his oeuvre and can be seen in works including <i>A covey of Partridges in a Landscape</i> (Christies, Lot 5281, 9th December 2007). Elmer\u2019s animal subjects reflect those of Dutch and Flemish seventeenth century masters. The composition of this painting, placing a group of fish in front of a landscape, derives from artists such as Willem Ormea (died 1673). For example in <i>Still life of fish with a Seascape</i> (Wakefield Art Gallery, accession number A1.597) Ormea presents two fish in front of a seascape. As with Ormea\u2019s work, Elmer is able to observe with detail the different patterns of the fish, including the iridescent colours of the rainbow trout. The fish appear to dominate the brooding landscape, drawing our attention into the painting.\n\nElmer was highly regarded as an artist during his day. In his <u>Annecdotes of painters who have resided or been born in England</u> Edwards described Elmer as \u201cA painter of dead game and still life, in which line of art he produced several good pictures, and was considered as the superior artist of his time for the representation of those objects, which are familiar to the sportsman, the cook and the <i>bon vivant</i>.\u201d\n\n\nReferences: \n\nEdwards, E. <u>Annecdotes of painters who have resided or been born in England, with critical remarks on their productions</u>, London, 1808, p.235.",

            "historical_context_note": "The Free Society of Artists was founded in London in 1762. This was formed from the Society of Artists which had been founded a year earlier. In response to the Salons of Paris the Society of Artists aimed to provide a public venue in which works by living artists could be shown. It had been begun the previous year by artists including Sir Joshua Reynolds (1723-1792) and Francis Hayman (1708-1776). From 1761 the society was held annual exhibitions at Spring Gardens, Charring Cross. The majority of the participating figures were lesser artists who formed between them the Free Society of Artists. The Spring Garden faction adopted the title 'Society of Artists' and were incorporated as such by Royal Charter in 1765. In spite of the Royal Academy, which arose from the same friction, the Society of Artists survived until 1791.",
