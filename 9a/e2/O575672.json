            "public_access_description": "This large fashion illustration is an original drawing signed Fanny Fern Fitzwater. It depicts two very smartly dressed women in day dresses with matching scarves, fashionable in the late 1920s. The woman on the right also wears a very large geometric Art Deco bracelet. The dresses were probably designed by Jean-Charles Worth of the House of Worth, as this drawing was found in the archives of the Houses of Worth and Paquin alongside other designs by Worth.\n\nFanny Fern Fitzwater (1886-1966) was an American fashion illustrator and journalist. She regularly travelled to Paris to report back from the seasonal fashion shows during the 1920s and 1930s, and as this drawing shows, drew her own illustrations. By the late 1930s she had become a regular reporter for the New York Herald Tribune and was a recognised fashion authority.",
