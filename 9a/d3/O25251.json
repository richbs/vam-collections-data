In fact water-colour was a well-established method, which Sandby's skills, practised over a long career, promoted and elevated. He was a founder member of the Royal Academy and this position enabled him to raise the water-colour to exhibition status. \n\nSandby's earliest landscapes were produced for a military survey in the Highlands. This fostered an accurate and detailed approach. In 1752 he joined his brother Thomas, who was Deputy Ranger of Windsor Forest, in schemes of landscaping and improvement. Windsor Castle and its environs were to be a major source of Sandby's subject matter for the next twenty years. These studies combine topographical accuracy with a feeling for the Picturesque. \n\nThis view is a very late version dating from about 1800, of an earlier subject. The original was painted sometime in 1770, and appeared as an aquatint in Sandby's publication <i>Five Views of Windsor Castle and Eton</i> 1776-7. Although he makes a concession to the passage of time by minor changes of costume, the figures themselves, and the architecture, are drawn from his old sketchbooks. The soldier seated on the parapet also appears in a drawing in the Royal Collection of the gardens at Old Somerset House. Sandby was a master of the dramatic composition, a device which raised his 'real views from nature' above mere topography. Here the picture is divided diagonally - the dark mass of the castle apartments, and the shadowed expanse of the terrace oppose a vast area of clear evening sky above the flat landscape of the Thames valley. \n\nSandby was unusual amongst the 18th-century English water-colourists in that he used body colour (or gouache) for a large part of his output. This medium, in which the water-colour is mixed with white to make it opaque, was popular on the Continent. Sandby used pure water-colour for his military work and for subjects intended for the engravers, but he favoured body colour because it was better suited to the necessarily large scale of his exhibition works. \n\nGillian Saunders\"",

In fact water-colour was a well-established method, which Sandby's skills, practised over a long career, promoted and elevated. He was a founder member of the Royal Academy and this position enabled him to raise the water-colour to exhibition status.\n\nThis view is a very late version dating from about 1800, of an earlier subject. The original was painted sometime in 1770, and appeared as an aquatint in Sandby's publication 'Five Views of Windsor Castle and Eton, 1776-7'. Although he makes a concession to the passage of time by minor changes of costume, the figures themselves, and the architecture, are drawn from his old sketchbooks. The soldier seated on the parapet also appears in a drawing in the Royal Collection of the gardens at Old Somerset House. Sandby was a master of the dramatic composition, a device which raised his 'real views from nature' above mere topography. Here the picture is divided diagonally - the dark mass of the castle apartments, and the shadowed expanse of the terrace oppose a vast area of clear evening sky above the flat landscape of the Thames Valley.\n\nSandby was unusual amongst the 18th-century English water-colourists in that he used body colour (or gouache) for a large part of his output. This medium, in which the water-colour is mixed with white to make it opaque, was popular in the Continent. Sandby used pure water-colour for his military work and for subjects intended for the engravers, but he favoured body colour because it was better suited to the necessarily large scale of his exhibition works.\n\n[Gill Saunders, '100 Great Paintings from the V&A', p.76]",
