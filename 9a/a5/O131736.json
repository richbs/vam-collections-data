            "physical_description": "Panelled chest of joined construction with two-tiered front incorporating two carved rails. The lid (probably replaced) consists of 3 butted boards (2.5cm thick, with a narrow gap between them filled with a fillet of wood), and with a narrow batten across both ends. There is evidence of a missing hasp, and it is held on two modern strap hinges (on the back of the chest is evidence that the original lid was fixed with ring hinges).The frame of the chest is formed by four unusually massive stile feet (the rear ones 93 x 81mm in section; the front ones 96 x 60mm); the front legs have a scratch moulding on their front faces. The top front rail is carved with a band of S-scrolls, and the centre rail with a similar band; between these are four oblong sunk panels, and below are five small squre panels divided by scratch-moulded muntins. The chest ends have a single oblong plain panel. The back has four plain vertical panels divided by muntins that are plain except for a slight chamfer.\nThe interior is plain panelled with riven panels with upper rails 27-30mm thick. The front rail has a central keyhole and was fitted with a metal lock (now missing). \nThe bottom is formed by 8 relatively new oak boards (arranged front to back), supported underneath by 7 modern batten nailed into the front and back lower rails. (There is no evidence of a till.)\n\nRepairs: front left foot replaced (worm damage). Lid replaced. Bottom boards replaced.",
