This was a picturesque village of ten or a dozen houses standing well out on a spar, with a fine foreground of massy foliage and mountains in the background. There was no wind, and I had no difficulty in securing an excellent negative of this interesting subject.'",

Below is the relevant section for this photograph: \n\n'Shortly afterwards the sun broke out, and two miles further on I suddenly came upon a capital subject for my camera. This was a picturesque village of ten or a dozen houses standing well out on a spar, with a fine foreground of massy foliage and mountains in the background. There was no wind, and I had no difficulty in securing an excellent negative of this interesting subject.'\n\nBourne, S, A Photographic journey through the Higher Himalayas, The British Journal of Photography, December 3 1869, pg 579.",
