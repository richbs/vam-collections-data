The heavier and more ornate the metal, the higher the status of the deceased. As cheaper materials and techniques were introduced, styles and designs could be cheaply copied. An observer in the Morning Chronicle in 1851 reported that undertakers sought coffin furniture for their clients that was 'tasteful, new and uncommon to produce'. This tin 'lace' would have decorated a coffin. It was made using the industrial process of die-stamping, and has been painted black so that it resembles heavier and more expensive material lead.",
