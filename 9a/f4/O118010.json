Ring brooches can be circular or heart-shaped, and their design dates from the Middle Ages.  They differ from modern brooches in the way they fasten.  The wearer pulls the cloth of the garment through the central hole, and then spears it with the pin.  The greater the strain on the pin, the more secure the fastening.  Ring brooches were worn throughout Norway in the 18th and 19th century.  Their shape and pattern varied by district and use.  They were worn by men, women, and children.\n\nThere are well over 50 different names for brooches in Norwegian.  Each kind of brooch has its own distinctive name, some of which date back to the Middle Ages.  \n  \nA glibbs\u00f8lje is a ring brooch decorated with six faces, usually human but occasionally animal.  It is a variant of the spores\u00f8lje, which is a ring brooch with projections round the outside.  They are usually made of cast metal, and were most popular in the south west of Norway, though they are found as far north as Lapland.  Both men and women wore them.\n\nThis brooch has the letter M on the back, which may be the owner\u2019s initial.  Norwegians often inscribed their initials on the back of their brooches.",
