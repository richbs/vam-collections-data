Her veil was held in place by a heavy wreath of orange blossom worn low on her brow and her long court train was carried by a page and bridesmaid. She also wore a camisole with scalloped lace edging to soften the square neckline of the dress and cover her d\u00e9colletage.\n\nVelvet was a popular choice for winter weddings in the 1920s and fabrics incorporating gold and silver threads were fashionable alternatives to white satin. By 1926 some brides were marrying in knee length sleeveless or short-sleeved dresses but others, like Maud Cecil, took a more traditional approach and chose an ankle length skirt.",
