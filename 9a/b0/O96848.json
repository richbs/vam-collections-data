The other version, in silver, was reproduced in the Dekorative Kunst magazine (vol. XXXIV, 1925-6). Josef Hoffmann (1870-1956), who designed it, was a highly influential Viennese architect and designer. \n\nIn 1903 Hoffmann co-founded the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte, the exclusive Viennese workshops inspired by the Guild of Handicraft the English architect and designer C.R. Ashbee had set up in London. The workshops wanted to create good, simple design and new modern forms. They made this piece, with its hammered surface and curvilinear decorative handles, which influenced many silver designs of the 1920s.",
