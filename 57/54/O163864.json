The  Alexandria-born Greek Cavafy, whom he discovered in 1960, was one of his favourite poets. In 1966 Hockney travelled to Beirut  in search of the kind of atmosphere he imagined Alexandria would have had at the time when Cavafy was writing there. However the images which he ultimately made to illustrate a selection of Cavafy's poems are mostly of  young male couples which could have been made in many places apart from Egypt in the early 20th century. It is their simplicity and  frankness which reflect the quality of Cavafy's writing which appealed to Hockney. The portrait of the poet sets the scene for the ensuing illustrations.",
