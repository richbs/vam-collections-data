He later settled in Nuremberg and he became court painter to prince Bishop Lothar Franz von Sch\u00f6nborn in Frankfurt am Main. \n\nThis painting is a fine example of Johann Melchior Roos' compositions heavily influenced by his father's. It shows a coach attacked by brigands under a bridge with a distant landscape in the background. This type of paintings is characteristic of the Bamboccianti, active in Rome in the second half of the 17th century.",

In 1684-85 he was a member of the Drawing Academy at The Hague and from 1686-90 he was in Italy, where he came under the influence of his brother Philipp Peter (1657-1706), known as 'Rosa da Tivoli'. In 1695 he settled in Frankfurt, where he enjoyed the patronage of the Count of Sch\u00f6nborn, Like his father, he was primarily a painter of animals. \n\n\n304 \nBRIGANDS ATTACKING WAGONERS \nSigned lower right <i>J. Roos</i>\nOak panel \n13 \u00bc  X 18 (35 X 45.7) \n541-1870\n\nOn the back is a label inscribed by Parsons 'Bot. of Gale in Holborn about 3 or 4 years since, he did not know who painted it. I find the name OD the right foreground \"J. Roos\", July 1868 JMP.' \nAfter Parsons' discovery, the painting was firmly catalogued as Johann Heinrich Roos (1631-85) of Frankfurt (1893 <i>Catalogue</i>, p. 184). This attribution was not accepted by Jedding (1955), who was apparently unaware of the signature and who attributed the picture to Matthias Scheits (c. 1625/30-c. 1700) of Hamburg. \nThe signature is doubtless genuine, yet one can understand Jedding's doubts concerning the attribution to Johann Heinrich Roos. For 541-1870 is characterized by violent action and almost excess of movement, which distinguishes it sharply from the unruffled calm and static poses of J. H. Roos's work. \nThe apparent contradiction is resolved by the discovery of a pen drawing with the identical composition, though set in an open landscape (Glade Gallery, New Orleans), signed and dated <i>J M Roos 1685 a la Hay</i>. This is Johann Melchior Roos, the son and pupil of Johann Heinrich. 541-1870 would seem to be based on this drawing and it also should be attributed to Johann Melchior. \nThere is another version in oil, identical but slightly reduced at the left and lower edges (panel, 33.5 X 43 cm., present whereabouts unknown, photograph in Witt Library, Courtauld Institute). This was formerly called Wouvermans, but might be more accurately described as by or after Johann Melchior Roos. The attribution to Wouvermans need cause no surprise, for the composition was conceived when Johan Melchior Roos was a member of the Drawing Academy at The Hague and it is quite likely that it was inspired by a Dutch composition, perhaps of Wouvermans, who painted similar scenes (e.g. Liechtenstein Gallery, Vaduz). \nIn adapting the composition of the drawing for the oil painting, Roos has made the action take place against a background of classical ruins reminiscent of the Colosseum. This makes it seem likely that the painting was carried out after his visit to Italy in 1686-90, a few years later than the drawing upon which it is based. The fact that it is on oak panel suggests that it was painted north of the Alps rather than in Italy. \n\nProv. Gale, Holborn; c. 1864, John Parsons, bequeathed to the Museum in 1870.\nLit. H.

Parsons, 1870\n\nHistorical significance: Formerly attributed to Johann Heinrich Roos (1631-85) and successively to Matthias Scheits (c. 1625/30-c. 1700), the date and definitive attribution of the painting was assessed by the discovery of a preparatory drawing formerly in the Glade Gallery, New Orleans, inscribed with 'J M Roos 1685 a la Hay'. \nJohann Melchior Roos executed a number of works very close to that of his father along with animal pieces he produced as early as 1685 and in which he almost exclusively specialised at the end of his career.\nThis painting is characteristic of the Bamboccianti, a group of painters, mostly foreign, who painted in 17th-century Rome in the style of Peter van Laer called Il Bamboccio (ca.1592-1642), influenced by his small works representing genre subjects related to contemporary Italian life.",

The term conventionally refers to the school of foreign painters and draughtsmen (mostly of Dutch, Flemish, German or French origin) who were active in Rome for more than a hundred years, starting from the early 17th century. These artists produced mainly pastoral subjects bathed in warm southern light, set in an Italian, or specifically Roman, landscape. Particulalry representative of this tendency were the Bamboccianti, a group of painters who specialised in small genre subjects in the manner of Pieter van Laer, called il Bamboccio The taste for the Italianates continued undiminished into the 19th century. An early voice denouncing these artists was that of John Constable (1776-1837) and at the end of the century Italianates had lost favour oartly because of the rise of Impressionism and the appreciation of the Dutch national school of landscape expounded by such eminent critics as Wilhem von Bode, E.W. Moes and Cornelis Hofstede de Groot.",
