Produced in the mid-sixteenth century for the French court, these wares feature detailed and elaborate decoration and were probably crafted for display rather than for use.\n\nThe creation of these intricate designs would have been highly labour intensive. Elements of the decoration were moulded, stamped or inlaid to build up the complex overall pattern. Such was the skill and time required to make these wares, royal patronage is often assumed.\n\nThough traditionally thought to have been made in the town of Saint Porchaire (hence the name) it is now thought that these ceramics may have been produced in Paris.\n\nDuring the 19th century, Saint Porchaire ceramics became highly desirable collectors\u2019 items and a number of imitations were produced, such as Minton\u2019s \u2018Henri Deux\u2019 wares. Today there are fewer than 80 known examples of original Saint Porchaire ceramics.",

Espoulart of Paris, 1857.\n\nHistorical significance: \"Saint Porchaire\" ceramics are characterised by the whiteness of the clay used in their production. The chemical composition of the clay was ideally suited to the successful firing of crisp and detailed decorations, comprising numerous separate parts, and intricate design. The exact technique employed in the production of these pieces is still debated. Some elements were impressed and filled with a clay of contasting colour and moulded details were applied by hand. Similarly, the provenance of these enigmatic pieces remains a matter of some speculation. However, the extremely high quality of their design and execution, not to mention their rarity, implies that they were intended for a refined and courtly market and were therefore probably made in, or close to, Paris, rather than the village of Saint Porchaire. Recent scholarship has suggested the atelier of Bernard Palissy as their most likely source.",
