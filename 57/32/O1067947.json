Full Citation: \n \n\"<b>Elizabeth of Bohemia</b>   \n<b>1623-6</b> \nP2-1917\n \n<b>Oval 50 x 39 mm</b>       \n \nFeatures in soft brown stipples and long hatching strokes, red for the lips and dark blue-grey fro the eyes, with white highlights, all on a pale carnation ground; hair in densely worked dark brown hatches over pale brown wash; ruff in impasted white, shadowed in grey over pale grey wash; ear-rings in metallic silver and white, with gold; fichu in fine white lines shadowed with grey, over the carnation; necklace in silver over thick white; rosettes modelled in pink and crimson; background in 'clouded' transparent lavender-grey wash; on vellum put down on a leaf from a table-book. \n \n<b>Condition:</b> Very faded and the silver blackened; slightly cropped in the margins. \n \n<b>Signed:</b> Centre right, in gold: <i>PO</i> (interlaced). \n \n<b>Frame:</b> A plain black painted wooden oval (c.1900?), the backboard inscribed in ink: <i>Miniature of a Lady by Peter Oliver, Signed PO C.P.Chr\u00e9tien</i>; and a more recent inscription identifying the sitter. \n \n<b>Provenance:</b> Miss C E Chr\u00e9tien, by whom bequeathed to the Museum, 1917. \n \n<b>Exhibited:</b>  V&A and Arts Council, <i>The Orange and the Rose</i>, 1964, no. 90a. \n \n<b>Literature:</b> Long 1929, p. 321; Long 1920, p. 52; <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 42. \n \nSee also the entries for Cat. Nos. 10 [Dyce 88] and 12 [P.27-1975].  This miniature has suffered much, probably through losing its original setting, which is likely to have been at least as grand and maybe of a greater melt-down value than that which has survived on Cat. No. 10.  Technically all three portraits are very elaborated: the 'literal' metallic rendering of the jewellery is reminiscent of Hilliard's portraiture of Elizabeth I, whose mantle as heroine of Protestantism Elizabeth of Bohemia had taken on.  The use of table-book leaf as a secondary support for the vellum, on the other hand, looks forward to the technical innovations of the next half-century.  Like the rest of its group, this miniature dates from c.1623-6 when Elizabeth was largely based in the Hague.  It would be consisted with the suggested source of Gerbier's innovative use of these grounded leaves (1) if Oliver first came across them on a visit to the Low Countries in the service of Elizabeth after her arrival there in 1612 as refugee from Bohemia and the Palatinate.  \n \nThe 'clouded' lavender-grey background at this date is very exceptional.  Perhaps it was conditioned by the colour of the enamel in the original locket.  Such background were a Peter Oliver invention that was picked up and transformed into almost a personal trademark by Alexander Cooper in the next generation. \n \n1 See Cat. No. 2 [P.47-1935].\"",
