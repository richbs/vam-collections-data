They were particularly renowned for the quality of their filigree work, which was worn and appreciated as much by Muslim as by Jewish women.\n\nThese delicate pendants are typical of the kind of fine filigree made by Jewish silversmiths in the 19th century.  They may be earrings, but are more likely to have been part of a larger pair of multi-part pendants made to hang down at either side of the face.  They would originally have had coloured pastes or stones set in the mounts on their front.\n\nWhen they were acquired by the Museum in 1909 they were attached vertically to each other, but were separated where the damaged pendant is now.  They were described as an \u2018engagement earring\u2019.",
