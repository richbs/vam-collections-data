By bringing the garden inside, he made significant cost and space savings. The two courtyard gardens meet the inhabitants' need for daylight and ventilation, and offer areas for safe play and relaxation. But this layout also means that identical houses can be built to the back and to the side, thus increasing urban density and reducing building costs where the walls are shared."

            "public_access_description": "This drawing is by the British architect John Prizeman. It was made to illustrate an article about housing that appeared in the 'Daily Express' newspaper in October 1959. The imaginary house was designed to be economical in terms of both space and cost. This saving is achieved by enclosing all the accommodation within a tight rectangular ground plan, bound by walls that are shared with three adjacent properties. Light, air and safe play areas are provided by two courtyard gardens. Prizeman has opted for an axonometric projection, a type of scale drawing particularly suitable for showing the insides of buildings from above. The viewer has the sense that he or she is peering into a box and, given the contained nature of the architecture, this must be intentional. Although small, the house is not mean. There is plenty of room for modern goods and fashionable features. Prizeman populates the drawing with a television, contemporary furniture, a fitted kitchen, large windows and a recently launched \u2018Mini\u2019 in the garage. He completes the scene with a lounging father, busy mother, contented children and pet cat.",

As befits the title, many of its features are designed for ease of housework and the supervision and safety of children; 'she' is definitely at home. The design, which shows the effect of economic improvement in the 1950s, is in the most up to date American influenced Contemporary style and includes furniture form abroad, such as a chair by Charles Eames, as well as innovations such as the television, the double sink, the numerous built-in units, the combined living/dining room and the large 'picture' windows. Increasing wealth meant higher car ownership, so garaging is provided for a 'Mini', which was launched in 1959.",
