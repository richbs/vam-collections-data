The head would be displayed within a major retrospective exhibition of Gordine's bronzes and drawings to be held next year at Dorich House Museum, Kingston University and at Kingston Municipal Museum, Kingston-upon-thames, Surrey (11 Feb-5 May 2009).\nI am especially keen to display the head of Eumorfopoulos because, apart from it being a striking piece of work, he was largely responsible for arranging her first solo show in London at the Leicester Galleries in October 1928 while he also wrote the introduction to the exhibition catalogue. He later encouraged the artist to take an interest in and collect objets d'art from southeast Asia.",
