One was the innovation of a frit body (also called stone paste and quartz paste) which was developed in the middle of the 11th century in Iran. It consists of fine quartz powder, white clay and glass frit and was made to imitate the Chinese porcelains that were imported at the time.\n\nThrough the new frit body a great variety of new decorations developed such as underglaze painting which started in Iran and was perfected at Kashan. The blue pigment derives from cobalt oxide, and the black from a mineral containing iron, manganese and chrome. Both pigments proved to be relatively stable when painted under the glaze. \n\nThe present bowl belongs to a common type of early 13th century underglaze-painted wares. Its decoration shows the so called 'panel-style' which reveals radiating panels filled with floral motifs and inscriptions.",
