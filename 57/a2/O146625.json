            "public_access_description": "Ernest Nister (1842-1909) began his publishing career in 1885 when he acquired a lithographic workshop in N\u00fcrnberg and printed books for London publishers. In 1888 he became a publisher in his own right with offices at 24 St. Bride Street, London. He appointed the writer and editor, Robert Ellice Mack, as director. \n\nNister specialised in high quality colour printing for children in the last quarter of the 19th century. Movable books with various mechanisms became his speciality after 1890 (when be published his first stand-up book) but he also produced numerous picture books, annuals, poetry, nursery rhymes, calendars and greetings cards. He worked with a core of writers, including Clifton Bingham and Robert Ellice Mack, and illustrators, in particular Eveline Lance, Lizzie Lawson, Harriett M. Bennett, Edith A. Cubitt and Rosa Petherick. \n\nThis illustration by Rosa C. Petherick of a golliwog and Dutch doll sailing was probably produced for one of Ernest Nister's popular holiday annuals. Florence Kate Upton created the golliwog in her book, The Adventures of Two Dutch Dolls and a Golliwogg (1895). Her depiction of  the Golliwogg (later 'Golliwog') was inspired by a blackface minstrel doll that she had possessed as a child in America. Upton's book was extremely successful in England and the golliwog doll became a popular children's toy throughout most of the 20th century. Although Upton used the term without rascist intent, 'golliwogg' began to gain pejorative associations. The term is repeated here in its original historical context.",
