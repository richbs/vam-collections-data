In the middle of the 17th century the majority of wooden chairs and stools were not upholstered, and in more prosperous homes, decorated cushions were widely used both for comfort and for the attractiveness of their appearance.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThis cushion cover would have been worked by an amateur though accomplished embroiderer, on a canvas ground on which the  design had been drawn by a professional pattern drawer, adapting published prints. Because the design would have been drawn on the canvas in black outline only, the embroiderer could use her individual taste in the choice of colour, and to a more limited extent, stitch and type of thread.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe embroidery shows two scenes from the story of Abraham in the Old Testament : Abraham entertaining the Angels announcing the birth of Isaac, and the Angel restraining Abraham from sacrificing Isaac. The story of Abraham was an extremely popular subject in English 17th-century domestic embroidery, many versions surviving with minor variations. Most of these, and other Old Testament scenes used in embroidery, were taken originally from a book of biblical stories published by Gerard de Jode in Antwerp in 1585. The illustrations from this seem to have had wide circulation in England.",
