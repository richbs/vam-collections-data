Published in London Charles Sheard & Co., 1893.\n\nWealthy Victorian ladies were very interested in fashion. The invention of the sewing machine by Isaac Merrit Singer in 1851 led to the mass production of clothing, but many still had their clothes made by exclusive dressmakers. The main female fashion trend of the mid Victorian era was a tight bodice which blossomed out from the hips into a bell-like voluminous skirt. Skirts were able to be made like this due to the invention of an almost architectural device, the crinoline.\n\nCrinolines were steel hoops that were sown into a light dress frame. Sometimes up to thirty five of these hoops were used to create the desired effect. Although cumbersome this was considerably better than what had been the norm before. Crinolines replaced petticoats which had been lined with horsehair, that were far too hot and heavy. Crinolines had some disadvantages, the difficulty in being able to sit down being one. However the most embarrassing thing that could happen was that the hoops would make the skirt tilt, showing the lady's ankles! Here Fanny Leslie is unabashed at showing an ankle, as she steps out in the highest fashion.\n\nPopular music and fashion have always had a close relationship. Trends in music have been echoed by the clothes of the fans. Teddy boys, mods, rockers, new romantics and punks are just some of the groups that have been most identifiable by their clothes. Sometimes fans would dress in the style of the group they liked, other times groups would copy what was worn on the street. Some fashion designers and models have managed to have second careers in the music industry. Others, like Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood or have been highly influential.",
