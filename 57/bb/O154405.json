He draws directly from life and \u201cis able to distil the essence of a form; the clarity and rhythm of his emotive images\u2026 and strong simple forms produce pieces of quiet harmony which are... timeless\u201d. This server reflects the long oval shape of two hundred years ago; but unlike those, the filled handles of which lie in the plane of the blade, the artist has continued the apple theme of the blade on to the very substantial handle that lifts from the blade. Even that butt end is exquisitely finished- although, alas, not visible in the illustration. Lloyd has carried the chasing right to the edge of the blade, as he has frequently done on the rims of beakers and cups, he explains that \u201cNature is ongoing; it is not appropriate to break it off prematurely\u201d. He bears witness to the philosophy of the Arts and Crafts Movement.",
