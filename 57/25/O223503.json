By 1700 they were produced in very large numbers, particularly in the Netherlands. \n\nThe patterns were created by carved wooden moulds, into which the dampened panel of leather was pressed.  When dry, the raised areas were decorated with silver-coloured metal foil, varnished to give the effect of gilding. The ground areas were coloured with paints or varnishes, which might also be used to add highlights to the foiled areas.  Such panels are usually referred to as 'gilt leather' although no gold leaf was used.  They were particularly popular for dining rooms, where they did not trap food smells as textile hangings would do. \n\nThis pattern must have been highly popular.  Several versions are known, with different coloured finishes, both in museum collections and surviving in houses and public buildings as far apart as Brussels and Denmark.",

            "history_note": "The argument of A.J. Kendrick for accepting this panel and inventory number 421-1905 as a gift were: 'The two leather panels would be well worth adding to the Museum collection, as specimens of design and as examples of design and as examples of processes of working leather. They are both of 17th century work, and similar in design to many examples supposed to be as Spanish origin in the Museum.'\n\nThis is one of the most popular patterns ever made: five almost identical different versions have been traced (some of them in a mirrored version)(amongst which museum numbers 476-1869 and 477-1869), even as two other ones, slightly more different. The differences are in some of the flowers, the berries which are being eaten by the two birds,and the short 'string of pearls'.\n\nWall hanging in kasteel Meerhout (Belg.); castle Ulriksdal (Sweden).
