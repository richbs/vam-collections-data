In the corners there are heavy lines marking off each 'yard' or starting area of 13 squares with two diagonally opposite ones having an extra line marking out 19 squares.\nThere are four sets of pieces - each of a different colour; two sets of 13 and 2 sets of 19..  The pieces may be small checkers or counters, wooden or plastic cones, or wooden or plastic men resembling small chess pawns.\nThe game may be played by two players, 3 or 4 players playing separately, or by 4 players playing as partners.\nPartnership Halma may be played in two ways the first as pairs with pieces in adjacent yards or as pairs with pieces in the diagonally opposite yards.  The latter provides more scope for the partners to help each other.\nThe objective is for each player to attempt to move his p[ieces from his own yard into the yard diagonally opposite.  The game is won by the first player or pair to achieve this objective.\n\nStarting positions vary with the forms of play.\n1.  When there are two players, each takes a set of 19 pieces and positions them in the yards with 19 squares.\n2.  When there are 3 or 4 players , each one takes 13 markers and positions them on the 13 square areas.\n3.  Turns pass clockwise around the table if there are more than two players.  A player may move only one piece in a turn.\n4.  Moving pieces may be done in any direction - straight or diagonally, forward or backward, to one side or the other.\n5.  Two types of moves are permitted:-  1 - A STEP, by which the player moves his piece nto an adjoining square.  2- A HOP, by which a player moves his piece over a piece on an adjoining square and into a vacant square directly behind it.\n6.  A player may hop over his own or another player's pieces and all hopped pieces are left on the board.\n7.  A player may make several hops in one move, but may not combine steps and hops in a move.\n8.  There is no compulsion to make any hop.\n\nHALMA SOLITAIRE\nAn interesting Halma Solitaire problem requires the player to place 19 pieces in one of the yards and then in 19 moves position them in a symmetrical figure across the board's diagonal.  This problem can be solved in several 100 ways, and the interest therefore derives from the variety of solutions.  A fairly skillful player should be able to find 50 different solutions without too much difficulty.",
