This design is now identified with the geometrical style and primary colours used by the influential Dutch De Stijl movement. However, Gerrit Rietveld, who designed it, did not begin to produce the famous painted versions until 1923. The original design and several early versions, such as this one, were simply stained. The geometric design and simple construction of the chair grew out of Rietveld\u2019s search for new forms. He also drew on the simple geometric furniture designed by the Dutch architect H. P. Berlage. The work of the American architect Frank Lloyd Wright, which was popular in Holland at the time, was another source.",

ISBN 1851773088.\nThis example of a design classic by a leading figure of the Dutch de Stijl group has a provenance that can be traced back to the original patron. It was not, however, the first version of this famous chair to be acquired by the Museum, and its purchase reflects a significant shift in thinking about twentieth-century acquisitions. Popularly known as the Red Blue Chair, this Rietveld form has become synonymous with the geometry and primary colours of the influential modernist de Stijl movement. This version, however, predates the use of colour on the chair by about five years. With this design, Rietveld attempted to construct a chair from its most basic components, assembled in their simplest form, while also experimenting with modular design adaptable to cheap, mechanised production. The result is an abstract, architectural construction that has, since the 1950s, become an icon of modernism. Later painted versions of the chair dispensed with the side panels, which are the only nonfunctional elements of the earlier design.\nRietveld organised the first major retrospective exhibition of de Stijl for the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam in 1951; the show was also presented at New York's Museum of Modern Art, in 1952. Reproductions of the Red Blue Chair and the Zig-Zag Chair (1934) were acquired by the V&A's Circulation Department for its 1971 exhibition, \"Modern Chairs.\" However, it was not until 1987 that the Museum acquired an original Rietveld piece, the Crate Chair of 1934.\n\nLit.
