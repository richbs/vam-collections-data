In fact, the swan was historically not a symbol of Bolingbroke's house, but of the Duke of Gloucester, son of Edward III and in the medieval poem There Is a Busch That Is Forgrowe Bolingbroke is referred to as the heron - a bird that seeks high places and thus a suitable symbol for one who aspires to be king.  \n\nAccuracy of this kind is not, in fact, always helpful to a designer.  While many in a 1947 audience might be familiar with the swan's place in heraldry or folklore (as used for instance in Wagner's Lohingrin) and thus accept the symbol without question, to have used the more obscure heron might have made them wonder why it was being used and detracted their attention from the play. Designers always have to be very careful to work within the confines of the play and performers and not overpower the play and performers.",
