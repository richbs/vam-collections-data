This season admission ticket is an example of Great Exhibition ephemera. The Great Exhibition included examples of industrial design and fine art from all around the world. Foreign travel was unusual at the time, and the exhibition enabled visitors to see the exotic and the unfamiliar for themselves. The most eager visitors acquired season tickets such as this for repeat visits. The exhibition was open from 1 May to 15 October, 1851. For the first four weeks, the tickets were priced at 5 shillings, making them unaffordable to large sections of society. On 26 May, the price was dropped to one shilling.",
