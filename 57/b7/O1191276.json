Durable sake bottles, as exemplified by this piece, had to be both aesthetically pleasing and robust. On this vessel the thick black calligraphic brushwork enhances the white glaze and emphasises the subtle curvature of the body, while the wide base gives the piece stability. \n\nThe application of glaze was perfected at the Seto kilns during the fifteenth century and later adopted in the Mino province. Unpretentious in form and decoration the pieces sought to replicate Chinese porcelain ceramics that were in high demand within Japan. During the Momoyama period (1573-1615), many pieces were produced only for ritual or ceremonial use due to the expense of production. By the Edo period (1615-1868) manufacturing methods had significantly improved, reducing costs and subsequently increasing public demand for glazed stoneware. It was during this period that the Seto kilns began to produce vast volumes of Seto ware for everyday domestic use.",
