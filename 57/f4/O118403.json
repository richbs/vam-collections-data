            "public_access_description": "The design is for a border of a petticoat and not for an apron because it is rather deep for that and there is no right-angle, which there often is in apron designs, for example, in that for Lady Webster E.247-1973.  The scalloped edge is for the hem of a petticoat and gown as in an open gown at the Museum of London 51.20/1.  The design is inscribed 'Miss Vernon' however  is impossible to identify the right person without a first name and within the time constraints of this project because there were numerous Miss Vernons.  Possible candidates for the identity of this 'Miss Vernon' are: Miss Lucy Vernon, (d.1783), Hilton Park. There is an illustration of a portrait of Miss Lucy Vernon, adated 1779, which is also known as 'The Sempstress'.  Maxwell, H. George Romney. London: Walter Scott, 1902, opp. 40 p.\nLucy Vernon was the third daughter of Henry Vernon, Esq. of Hilton Park and Lady Henrietta Wentworth (youngest daughter of Thomas, Earl of Strafford).  It is perhaps not her because the design is on paper with a watermark which was recorded by Heawood as in paper used for a '1792' publication yet this fact can only be used as a guide to dating.  On the other hand, if it were Lucy Vernon's design it could have been used for someone else nine years later because Lady Frances Middleton's pattern was used two years after her death.  Another candidate is Miss Caroline Vernon who is represented as a girl in 1777 in a painting by Sir Joshua Reynolds entitled '5th Duke of Bedford, his brothers and Miss Caroline Vernon acting 'St. George and the Dragon'.  She looks of the right age to be a candidate for the 'Miss Vernon' of the design.",

            "history_note": "The designs were bequeathed to the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1973 by Raymond Johnes who had 'enormous and miscellaneous collections'.*  Johnes' collection included Japanese art, on which he published,** Indian and European material.  He did not specialise in collecting textiles although he owned some examples.  He was in contact with the Museum 1920s-1970 offering to sell objects from his collection.  Johnes did not provide the Museum with information about the history of ownership of the designs. \n\n *Mr B.W. Robinson, former Keeper of the Far Eastern Department, V&A, in a letter to Mr Ayres, Assistant- Keeper in the same Department, V&A Regsitry, nominal file, (MA/1/J479). \n\n**Johnes, Raymond. <u>Japanese Art</u> London: Spring Books, 1961.", 
            "place": "London", 
            "production_note": "The design comes from a group of designs that were part of a retailer's archive which employed professional embroiderers. The names of the female clients inscribed on the designs were of the aristocracy, gentry or from wealthy families that moved in the upper reaches of society.  They had homes in the country and came to London for the season.  Retailers who sold such designs were linen drapers and lacemakers, both of which categories existed in London and were available to the clients. Many pattern drawers worked in London where their trade proved a lucrative business during the season. The similarity of some of the designs from this group to those by Mr Styart whose designs were published in <u>The Fashionable Magazine</u> in London in 1786 does support the argument that these designs came from a retailer's archive based in London.\n\nAttribution note: The design is for a border of a petticoat and not for an apron because it is rather deep for that and there is no right-angle, which there often is in apron designs, for example, in that for Lady Webster E.247-1973.  The scalloped edge is for the hem of a petticoat and gown as in an open gown at the Museum of London 51.20/1.", 
            "historical_context_note": "It is impossible to identify the right person without a first name and within the time constraints of this project because there were numerous Miss Vernons.  Possible candidates for the identity of this 'Miss Vernon' are: \n\nMiss Lucy Vernon, (d.1783), Hilton Park. There is an illustration of a portrait of Miss Lucy Vernon, adated 1779, which is also known as 'The Sempstress'.  Maxwell, H. <u>George Romney</u>. London: Walter Scott, 1902, opp. 40 p.\nLucy Vernon was the third daughter of Henry Vernon, Esq. of Hilton Park and Lady Henrietta Wentworth (youngest daughter of Thomas, Earl of Strafford).  It is perhaps not her because the design is on paper with a watermark which was recorded by Heawood as in paper used for a '1792' publication yet this fact can only be used as a guide to dating.  On the other hand, if it were Lucy Vernon's design it could have been used for someone else nine years later because Lady Frances Middleton's pattern was used two years after her death.  \nMiss Caroline Vernon (Fig. 79).\nMiss Caroline Vernon looks of the right age to be a candidate for the 'Miss Vernon' of the design.  She is represented as a girl in 1777 in the group portrait with the 5th Duke of Bedford and his brothers.",
