Some British painters imitated this kind of oil painting in order to meet the steady demand.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nIn September 1835 Cooke went on a sketching tour of Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight, where he stayed at the Crab and Lobster Inn, Ventnor. There a local fisherman not only taught him how to make baskets and lobster pots, but also made scale models of them, presumably for the artist to paint from in his studio.  Then as now, fresh lobsters were considered a luxury food, and the image of a lobster still in its iron cooking pot would have given this work some of the appeal of a Dutch still life painting of food, but set unusually in the open air.\n\nPeople\nEdward William Cooke (1811-1880) started painting when he was very young, and aged only nine made drawings for the Encyclopaedia of Plants (1820). He had a long and profitable career as a marine painter, exhibiting 130 works at the Royal Academy. John Sheepshanks collected 11 of his paintings, as well as a number of watercolour studies for them.",

As a boy, drew plants for his father's engravings for Loddiges's monthly <i>The Botanical Cabinet</i> (1817-33). Also made preliminary drawings for his father's <i>London and its Vicinity</i> (1820-34) which were used by illustrators such as Stanfield, Prout, Cotman and Callcott, and worked on John Loudon's <i>Encyclopaedia of Plants</i> (1829). Etched his own illustrations for <i>Shipping and Craft</i> (1828-9) and with his father for Views of the Old and the New London Bridges (1833). Evidently made preliminary drawings for Stanfield. Painted in watercolours until 1834, when, after one lesson with James Stark, a family friend, he was inspired to paint in oils. Exhibited mostly marine and coastal subjects; 130 at the RA between 1835 and 1879,115 at the HI 1835-67, and three at the SBA 1835, 1838, 1876. Elected ARA 1851, RA 1863. Travelled extensively in Britain and abroad, most frequently in France from 1833, Holland from 1837, and Venice from 1850; also Italy 1845-6, Spain 1860-61, Egypt 1874. His inherited interest in natural history led to membership of several learned societies, notably FRS 1863, and his publication of <i>Grotesque Animals</i> (1872). Also published <i>Landscapes British and Foreign</i> (1874) and <i>Leaves from my Sketchbooks</i> (1876, 1877). Died Groombridge, Kent, 4 January 1880; his studio sales were at Christie's 22 May 1880 and 11 March 1882. \n\nLIT: Edited transcript of the artist's MS Diary, National Maritime Museum; MS Ledger of paintings completed 1829-78 (referred to below as <i>Ledger</i>), RA Library;<i>Illustrated London News</i> 13 August 1864, pp 173-4 (with engr portrait); <i>Art Journal</i> 1869, pp253-5; J Munday 'E W Cooke, Marine Painter' <i>Mariner's Mirror</i> (Society for Nautical Research) 1967, vol 53, pp99-113); <i>Edward William Cooke</i> Guildhall Art Gallery exhibition catalogue 1970, information also kindly supplied by John Munday \n\n<b>Lobster Pots, Ventnor</b> \nFA39 Neg 76820 \nCanvas, 39.4 x 53.3 cm (15\u00bd x 21 ins) \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nIn the <i>Ledger</i> as 'Lobster Pots, Ventnor, painted on the spot', and bought by Sheepshanks for \u00a326 5s. In September 1835, Cooke went on a sketching tour of Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight, where he stayed at the Crab and Lobster Inn, Ventnor. He recorded in his diary on 1 October that 'in afternoon made sketch of interior of the fisher hut with its gear etc. In evening rigged out baskets, buoys, corks etc'. He had been instructed in basket and lobster pot making by a local fisherman who had also made him some scale models of them. Back at Barnes, he noted on 3 December 'began Lobster pots in oil', presumably, in the light of the <i>Ledger</i> entry, another version of the subject. \n\nIt was exhibited at the BI in 1836, the size given in the catalogue as 24 by 29 inches. There is a watercolour study dated 12 October 1835 in the V&A collections, also from the Sheepshanks Gift (FA17). Waagen incorrectly states that this was the artist's first oil painting. \n\nEXH: BI 1836 (307) \nLIT: G Waagen <i>Treasures of Art in Great Britain</i> 1854, II, p303\"",
