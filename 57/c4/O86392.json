The design of the case is probably due to the influence of Edward Burne-Jones and his earlier designs for the Orpheus piano, made by the firm of John Broadwood, which originally belonged to Frances Graham, Lady Horner. Burne-Jones was interested in modifications to the shape and size of grand pianos and revived features taken from eighteenth-century harpsichords, including a trestle stand with six legs, a rectangular cover for the keyboard, and a sharp angle at the narrow end of the top. All these features were incorporated into the Ionides piano which was manufactured by Broadwoods. The gesso decoration was designed and executed by Kate Faulkner who was encouraged to persist in such delicate work by Philip Webb.\n\nIonides lent his grand piano to the first exhibition organised by the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society, held at the New Gallery in 1888. The grand piano was displayed in the North Gallery and the catalogue entry, No. 266a, identified the maker as John Broadwood and Sons and Kate Faulkner as responsible for the design and execution of the gesso. The catalogue also listed the ten craftsmen involved:\ncase maker J. Banks\ncaibnet makers, J. Wilson, W. Gilliam, S. Holkard, T. Pegg\nsound board maker, W. Robinson\nmaker-off of scale, T. Mead\nkey-makers, C. Tillson, G. Woolston\nfinisher of action, J. Shepherd\n\nThe grand piano was given to the Museum by Mrs. A.C. Ionides, a daughter-in-law of A.A. Ionides.",
