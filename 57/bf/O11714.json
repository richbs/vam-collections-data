It would have been arranged in tiers on a sideboard in the dining room, with the large and heavy cooler generally placed on the floor. Its function  was to rinse glasses and cool wine bottles.  In the 18th century, wine glasses were not set on the table, but brought to each diner by a servant. When empty they were rinsed with water from the fountain, with the dirty water discarded into the cistern, and refilled from the wine bottles chilling in the cooler.\n\nDesign & Use\nThe form and decoration of this immense cooler matches that of the smaller cistern. It would have been filled with ice taken from a nearby ice-house. Ice-houses were introduced to Britain from France in the 1660s. They usually took the form of an underground, brick building with an entrance tunnel and a drain in the base of the wall. The ice was placed there in the winter and remained frozen through the summer months.",
