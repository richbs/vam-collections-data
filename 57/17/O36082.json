It may be that the lid was put on before the varnish was properly dry and the two halves are stuck together. The top has been painted an orange with the underside having streaks of dark brown to represent a mushroom. The whole has then been painted in greens; orange and black to show leaves and flowers as well as a caterpillar; ladybird and spider in its web. The whole has been varnished. *Mushrooms are often used for storage of miniature wooden objects;\nparticularly household utensils; and other small children's toys. There is an example of one; but a completely different shape; in the museum's collection. \nThe maker; E K Latisheva; is a well known woman artist and she comes from a family of traditional craftsmen making these doll from before 1900.",
