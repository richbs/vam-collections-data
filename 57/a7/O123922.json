Adriaen Brouwer (b. 1605/6-1638) was a Flemish painter active in the northern Netherlands. He was a pupil of Frans Hals in Haarlem but is recorded in the Antwerp Guild of St Luke as an independent master 1631\u20132. Brouwer made a significant contribution to peasant genre painting in the first part of the 17th century.  His interior settings and unsentimental representations of coarse facial expressions and strong emotions were important thematic innovations. Brouwer\u2019s works contain deliberate references to moralizing literature, which elevated low-life genre painting to a new intellectual level. His paintings were highly regarded in his lifetime, particularly by Rembrandt and Rubens, who owned six and seventeen of his works respectively.  This work appears to imitate Brouwer\u2019s work from the 1650s when he began painting peasants and burghers in the act of relishing the small pleasures, such as excessive drinking and gambling, permitted by their modest experience. The work is probably a nineteenth century imitation of his manner.  The man\u2019s face has the typical \u2018beak-nosed\u2019 shape and pointed chin of Brouwer\u2019s figures and looks much like Brouwer\u2019s studies of different facial expressions/reactions such as the oval Man with Bread and Sausage in the Liechtenstein Collection, Vaduz (Knuttel, fig. 100).",

According to Houbraken he was a pupil of Hals at the same time as Adriaen Brouwer (c. 1626-27) but there is no other evidence for this. He entered the Haarlem guild in 1634, and became its dean in 1662. Influenced by Brouwer, and from 1640, by Rembrandt's chiaroscuro, he painted mainly peasant genre scenes, of which he also made some fifty etchings. \n\nManner of Adriaen van OSTADE \n\n261 \nHEAD OF AN OLD MAN \nOak panel \n61 \u00bd X 5 3/4 (16.5 X 14.6)\nDyce Bequest \nD.44 [now Dyce 44]\n\nAcquired as 'in the Dutch manner', this appears to be a 19th century work imitating Adriaen van Ostade. \n\nProv.

The <u>Catalogue. Paintings, Miniatures, &c.</u> by Samuel Redgrave notes of the 'Oil Paintings', 'The strength of Mr. Dyce's valuable bequest to Department of Science and Art does not lie in [this] portion ... which is in its nature of a very miscellaneous character.  The collection was made apparently as objects offered themselves, and without any special design.'  Dyce's main interest was in literary subjects, and this is reflected in many of the paintings he bequeathed to the V&A\n\nHistorical significance: Adriaen Brouwer (b. 1605/6-1638) was a Flemish painter active in the northern Netherlands. He was a pupil of Frans Hals in Haarlem but is recorded in the Antwerp Guild of St Luke as an independent master 1631\u20132. Brouwer made a significant contribution to peasant genre painting in the first part of the 17th century.  His interior settings and unsentimental representations of coarse facial expressions and strong emotions were important thematic innovations. Brouwer\u2019s works contain deliberate references to moralizing literature, which elevated low-life genre painting to a new intellectual level. His paintings were highly regarded in his lifetime, particularly by Rembrandt and Rubens, who owned six and seventeen of his works respectively.  This work appears to imitate Brouwer\u2019s work from the 1650s when he began painting peasants and burghers in the act of relishing the small pleasures, such as excessive drinking and gambling, permitted by their modest experience. The work is probably a nineteenth century imitation of his manner.  The man\u2019s face has the typical \u2018beak-nosed\u2019 shape and pointed chin of Brouwer\u2019s figures and looks much like Brouwer\u2019s studies of different facial expressions/reactions such as the oval <i>Man with Bread and Sausage</i> in the Liechtenstein Collection, Vaduz (Knuttel, fig. 100)",

            "production_note": "Acquired as 'in the Dutch manner' this work was described as 'style of Adriaen van Ostade' by Kauffmann in 1973 but appears to have much more in common with the physiognomies and figural studies by van Ostade's contemporary Adriaen Brouwer.", 
            "historical_context_note": "This work is typical of Genre Painting, a style which represented the lower or peasant classes of society that became increasingly popular throughout the 17th century in the Netherlands. These pictures usually depict scenes of everyday life, set in domestic interiors or in the open countryside. Some bear metaphorical meaning or moralising messages, but others may just be intended as representations of daily events. In both cases they are associated with health, pleasure and liberty. The leading figures of the Haarlem school in this field were Adriaen Brouwer (1606-1638) and Adriaen van Ostade (1610-1685).",
