Laguerre is shown singing the air 'Poor Children Three' in Act I, Scene 2.  On the back are sketches (6) of male heads including three caricatures of men wearing wigs.  English, c.1737. \n<i>Inscribed on the back</i> Charles William J[...]t (<i>partly cut off</i>) <i>and</i> Poor Children Three - Devoured he That Could not with Him graple and at one Sup he Eat them up as one would Eat an Aple an A...and at one Sup - he Eat them up as one would Eat and Aple.  The Musick by Mr:[...]. \n<i>Pen and ink.</i>                            E.84-1956 \n\n<i>Note:</i> For the text and air of 'Poor Children Three' see <i>Bickham's Musical Entertainer</i>, Vol. II, London, 1737-8, Pl.24.  Jean Laguerre (c.1700-1743) was born in London, the son of Louis Laguerre, the painted (1663-1721).  In his youth he had been trained in his father's profession, but later he became a singer, appearing at Lincoln's Inn Fields, Covent Garden and other theatres in London.  It is possible that this drawing dates from about 1737 and is by him. \nThe inscription on the back of the drawing may refer to the dramatist Charles Johnson (1679-1748).\"",
