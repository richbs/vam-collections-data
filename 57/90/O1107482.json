            "history_note": "This engraving features in Thomas Bewick's first major independent publication, <i>A General History of Quadrupeds</i>, first printed and published in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1790. It contains illustrations of animals, alongside brief descriptions of their appearance, habits and habitats, accompanied by a number of illustrative vignettes, used mainly as tailpieces.\n\nHistorical significance: Thomas Bewick was the first engraver to exploit fully the advantages of end-grain wood (the wood is cut across, rather than along, the grain). Once it had been proved that the technique could rival the fine effects of metal engraving, the advantages of wood engraving to the book trade were quickly recognised. Allowing both text and illustration to be printed in one operation, it ousted the intaglio process as the favourite for book illustration and was only superseded at the end of the nineteenth century when methods of photomechanical reproduction were developed.\n\nIn the published volume, the text accompanying this illustration includes a paragraph expressing Bewick's (or possibly Ralph Rathe's - it is disputed as to which man was primarily responsible for the final text) vehement distaste of animal crulety:\n\n'<i>The excessive cruelties practised upon this poor animal in teaching it to walk erect, and regulate its motions to the sound of the flagelet, are such as make sensibility shudder. Its eyes are put out ; and an iron ring being put through the cartilage of the nose to lead it by, it is kept from food, and beaten, till it yield obedience to the will of its savage tutors. Some of them are taught to perform by setting their feet upon hot iron plates, and then playing to them whilst in this uneasy situation. \u2013 It is truly shocking to every feeling mind to reflect, that such cruelties should be exercised upon any part of the brute creation by our fellow-men. That they should be rewarded by numbers of unthinking people, who crowd around them to see the animal\u2019s rude attempts to imitate human actions, is not to be wondered at: But it is much to be wished, that the timely interference of the magistrate would prevent every exhibition of this kind, that, in England at least, we might not be reproached with tolerating practices so disgraceful to humanity</i>.'",
