Black and red, decorated with applied panels of red Chinese silk damask, and English floral print (probably Manchester printing).\n\nThe body of the jacket is made of two strips of hand-woven cloth. These strips are folded in half, the fold forming the shoulders, and then over stitched together leaving a front opening. Additional strips of cloth have been formed into tubes for sleeves and over stitched at the shoulders. Decorated with a 'key' pattern, in brick-red, between closely ribbed borders. The applied panels decorate the back and the breast, and the silk damask ones have a geometrical pattern in red, and below them are panels of printed cotton which have a floral design in orange and pale green. The cowrie shells are sewn on to the applied bands as well as the short sleeves and the 'key' patterned parts of the jacket. With woven border of coarse red-brown wool.",
