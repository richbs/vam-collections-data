Although individual pieces rarely date back any earlier than the 19th century, the designs are very old, and European observers liked to find traces of Roman or Phoenician influence.\n\nThe use of ring brooches to fasten women\u2019s traditional clothing is universal across the region and dates back to late Roman times.  Most of these brooches are penannular in shape, like this one, with all the decoration lavished on the head of the pin.  They were worn in pairs, usually linked together by a long chain threaded through the hole at the top of the pin, to hold the dress together, and were worn upside down, with the pin and the plain ring at the top, and the decorative head hanging down.\n\nThe design of this pin identifies it as coming from the Aur\u00e8s region of Algeria.  The jewellery of Aur\u00e8s is much more austere than the better-known enamelled coral jewellery of the Kabyle region.",
