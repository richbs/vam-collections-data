It is part of a collection made by Arthur Astill, who kept posters, handbills and advertisements from theatres where he appeared in variety. Top of the bill at Leeds in June 1931 was 'Britain's Master of Comedy' Will Hay, whose impersonation of a harassed school master at St Michael's became well known to film audiences later in the 1930s. Arthur Astill appeared with Gwen Fontaine 'in mimicry and ventriloquism'.\n\nArthur Astill (1887-1962) started his career in a Pierrot Troupe known as the Olympic Serenaders. He became a solo 'mimetic and whistler' and in 1912 was described as 'the Whistling Ploughboy'. He went on to form a double act with Gwen Fontaine (1891-1978) whom he married in 1911. Astill took the top billing in Leeds with Gwen Fontaine as his assistant, but later in the 1930s they were billed as Astill and Fontaine. One of their later double acts, entitled 'Impressions of Country Life' used Arthur's whistling skills in impersonations of birds, and also included impressions of animals and children.",
