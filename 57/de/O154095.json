            "public_access_description": "This tailored costume was made by London fashion house Mascotte. The jacket and skirt of purple gaberdine are trimmed with a binding of fancy black silk braid. The hip-length jacket, fastened with a single button, has narrow sleeves and a buckle at the back to provide shaping at the waist.  It is lined with purple silk with the Mascotte label at the neck. The skirt, which is in the narrower style of the 1910s, flares slightly at the hem and is made to look as if it wraps around the front. In fact it is fastened at the back with hooks and eyes. A slight fullness at the back of the skirt is held with a small buckled tab. Five pairs of decorative buttons, covered in black braid which descend from the waist are almost entirely hidden by the jacket which suggests it would have been worn separately with just a blouse when inside. \n\nMascotte of 89 Park street was one of the great houses of the Edwardian period and like the house of Lucile, a much more famous contemporary, was run by a Society Woman, Mrs Cyril Drummond. Worn by Miss Heather Firbank (1888-1954) this ensemble forms part of a collection of well over 100 pieces of her clothing acquired by the museum in 1960. Miss Firbank (1888-1954), daughter of the affluent Member of Parliament Sir Thomas Firbank and sister of the novelist Ronald Firbank, patronised many of the top London dress-makers and tailors of the time.  Mascotte, based in Park Lane was just around the corner from the Firbank's London residence.  \n\nThe Heather Firbank collection forms an invaluable record of a stylish and wealthy woman's taste between about 1905 and 1920. Many items were shown in an exhibition at the Museum in 1960: 'Lady of Fashion: Heather Firbank and what she wore between 1908 and 1921'.",
