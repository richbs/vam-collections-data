The feet are separate pieces joined on but not jointed. The head and body are carved from a single piece of wood. The body is rounded at the upper front and flat at the back and lower front. The lower arms are carved at the ends in a curve to indicate hands. The lower parts of all the limbs are painted white and the feet black. The head and shoulders are painted cream with different colours for the facial features. There is a black hair cap with grey curls showing, the eyes are blue and the mouth a red line with blob in middle. The eyebrows are grey lines and the cheeks have a pink blush. The nose protrudes. There is a hole in the top of the head.\nThe doll wears a simple sleeveless cotton dress with white and red horizontal stripes. This is glued to the legs on the outer side of each upper leg. It was originally fastened to the back upper body with a pin but this is now missing",
