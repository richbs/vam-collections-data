Under Yoshimitsu the Zen principles of restraint, understatement, economy of movement and frugality of expression became incorporated into the performance. By the early seventeenth century Noh had become an even more austere and formalised drama reserved almost exclusively for the military elite.\n\nThe Noh mask of Asakura-Jo depicts an old man; the broad bone structure, direct glance, slightly smiling mouth disclosing two rows of teeth together with the real hair used on the moustache, beard and topknot all lend the mask a rustic and healthy look, contrasting with the elegant dignity to be found on other types of \u2018Old Men\u2019 masks \u2013 which are often used to represent deities. The mask is used for roles such as old fishermen or farmers in the first act of warrior plays such as Yashima (Yashima Bay) and Tadanori (The Warrior Tadanori). According to one account, the name for the mask derives from the fact that the original of this mask was presented to the warlord Asakura. Another account of the origin of the name is a pun on the characters used to write the name making him the 'Old Man of the Brightening Dawn.'",

From his studio in Kobe, Suzuki continued a tradition which stretches back over some 600 years creating Noh masks both for performance and exhibition. Suzuki has donated a number of masks since 1987 thereby enhancing the V&A\u2019s collections of masks which began in 1876 when we acquired 12 masks from Samuel Bing. \n\nDuring February and March 2002 in the Toshiba Gallery at the V&A, as part of the Japan 2001 Festiva, Suzuki displayed 12 masks in the exhibition \u2018The Spirit of Transformation: the Noh masks of Suzuki Nohjin\u2019 and subsequently donated six masks (FE.127 to 132-2002). \n\nIt was typical of Suzuki\u2019s friendship with the V&A that even on his death-bed that among his last thoughts he instructed a bequest of No masks \u2013 including a mask of Okina, a type that I had mentioned to Suzuki many years ago that we would dearly love to have in our collection.",
