It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand. He compiled them in a series of albums. Leamore\u2019s act at the Grand consisted of patter and two songs - one about marrying Liza, and the second about the tribulations of a park-keeper. Other performers on the bill that week with Leamore included The Egbert Brothers, who were also drawn by Cooke.\n\nLeamore\u2019s first professional appearance was as an eccentric comedian and clog dancer at the Old Rodney Music Hall in 1880. He then appeared at the Star, Bermondsey, in 1882, at the Middlesex Music Hall, and in the West End of London at the Trocadero. He became one of the most successful character comedians of the 1890s and a regular performer at all the leading London halls as well as the provincial circuit. His most famous songs included \u2018Hi! Hi! Hi! I Thought She Was So Shy\u2019 and \u2018Percy from Pimlico\u2019. Leamore was one of the first music hall performers to make commercial recordings.",

            "history_note": "This caricature is of the music hall performer, singer and comedian Tom Leamore (1866-1939). Leamore made his first professional appearance in 1880 at the Old Rodney Music Hall. After appearing at the Star, Bermondsey in 1882, he appeared at the Middlesex music hall and subsequently in London's West End at the Trocadero and most of the leading halls. An advertisement in 'The Era' for September 1903 shows him appearing at three London halls in one night. Some of the songs with which he was associated include 'Serving 'em all Alike'; 'My Intended'. 'The Shipwrecked Captain', and 'Percy from Pimlico'. He was one of the first music hall performers to make commercial recordings. The caricature comes from the second album of caricatures in a collection of albums owned by the Theatre Museum compiled by the graphic artist George Cooke.  It is labelled by the artist 'Geo Cooke HYS BOOKE' and features music hall performers working in the early 20th century.",
