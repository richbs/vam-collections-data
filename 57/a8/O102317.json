It comes from the story S\u00earat Cabolek (The Book of Cabolek), thought to have been written by Raden Ngabehi Yasadipura I, the pioneer of modern Javanese verse, who died in 1729. There are many versions of the story which became a popular shadow theatre play, often performed under the name Bima Suci (The Holy W\u00earkudara).  Dewa Ruci is The Holy W\u00earkudara, since after his enlightenment he changed his name to Bima.",

The good characters are recognisable by their elongated features and pointed noses, whilst the evil characters have round eyes, bulbous noses and protruding teeth.  Even today Javanese puppet shows are imbued with mystical associations and often form part of marriage, birth and thanksgiving ceremonies.",
