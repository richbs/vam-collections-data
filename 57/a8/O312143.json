It depicts the head of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales.\n\nThe society for promoting the acclimatisation of animals and plants in other countries was founded in 1860 by Hon. Grantley Berkeley, Mr. J. Crockford and Mr F. Buckland. The Prince of Wales was elected president of the society in 1865. The society did not however flourish.\n\nGeorge Gammon Adams (b. 1821-1898) was a portrait sculptor and medallist. He designed and exhibited prize medals for the Great Exhibition. In 1852 he was chosen to model the death mask of Wellington. One of his public monuments is the 'Napier' statue in Trafalgar square.\n\nThe roundel was among the items given to the Museum by I. D. Adams, the daughter of  George Gammon Adams, in 1980. In total, 196 items were included in the Adams gift, which consisted of many models for medals as well as the busts and figurative sculpture. In most instances it is not possible to date conclusively the many models included in this gift.",
