It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years. Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nRoy Fox was born in Denver, Colorado, and arrived in Britain in 1930 as an established band-leader. He performed at the Caf\u00e9 de Paris with an eight piece all-American line-up, but made his name through a Decca recording contract and by becoming resident band-leader at the Monsigneur Restaurant in Piccadilly for which he assembled some excellent British musicians including singer Al Bowlly. Fox and his band appeared at the Palladium in December 1930 and he eventually formed a second band which proved popular during its time at the Caf\u00e9 Anglais. Over the next few years he did a round of club and stage performances, backed up by radio broadcasts and studio dates. In 1938 he went to Australia, only returning to Britain in the postwar years.",
