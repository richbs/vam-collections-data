He received many awards at the end of his life and became a member of the Munich and the Berlin Academies.\n\nThis painting is a good example of the naturalistic landscapes Baisch started to paint in the 1870s when he came back from France. This work, which depicts horses, cattle and sheep sheltering under trees from a storm, shows dramatic rendering of light and difficult weather conditions characteristic of the French Naturalist painters and the Dutch imagery from the 17th century.",

Educated at Leeds Grammar School, and was deputy chairman of the London, Chatham and Dover Railway Company 1869-70.  Died Winslade, near Exeter, 7 December 1885.  Bequeathed all his collection of drawings, watercolours and oil paintings to the Bethnal Green Museum; they have since been transferred to the V&A.  He also collected engravings, Japanese vases and panels, and bronze and marble sculpture.\n\nHistorical significance: This painting is characteristic of the 19th-century German art which was strongly influenced by the 17th-century Dutch imagery. The dramatic effect of light and difficult weather conditions is on the other hand reminiscent of the post-Romantic output. \nBaisch worked for some time in Paris under Rousseau and seemed to have found his inspiration in the land by the North sea and in the wide plains bordering the Dutch coast. Such pictures dramatised by the effect of the storm on the natural elements attracted patrons and collectors of the 19th century although this movement waned under the development of Impressionism.\nComparable works include <i>Highway in Rainy Weather, Holland</i> and <i>Dutch Pasturage, Morning</i> in the National Gallery of Victoria as well as a painting dated 1882-84, presented at Sotheby's London, 23 Nov. 2000, lot. 16. Compare with these compositions, the V&A painting is particularly remarkable for the rendering of the wind effect in the foliage.",
