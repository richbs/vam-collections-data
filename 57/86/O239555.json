The event was organised to create digital portraits via a computer network.\n\nThe Amiga computer system, operated by Michael Wright, was established as the first link of the network and was used to scan in black and white portraits of participants in real time.\n\nNext file formats containing portrait data were converted to Macintosh file formats and transferred to a second link, a Mac workstation. Artist, Liz Crimzon, painted backgrounds for the portraits.\n\nA second Macintosh, linked to the first Mac by an internal network, was operated by Paras Kaul who sent the computer enhanced portraits by modem from a phone line at the Convention Center to Paras Productions in Washington, D. C.\n\nAt this location computer graphic campaign buttons for the democratic party were added. Portraits were then sent back to the Amiga workstation which was connected to a 16 monitor video wall at the Convention Center where they were viewed by CYBERARTS participants.\"",
