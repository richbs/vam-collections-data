The palace was built by Giulio Parigi for the Senator Niccolo dell' Andrea and was completed in 1619, and the fountain was presumably supplied soon afterwards. A late 17th century writer records that there was formerly a bronze figure by Giambologna (1529-1608), sculptor to the Medici Grand Dukes of Tuscany, in the centre of the basin. The bronze cannot be identified with certainty. The original figure had already been replaced by the Bacchus seen here at the time of acquisition. this figure dates from the 18th or possibly early 19th century."

The palace was built by Giulio Parigi for the Senator Niccolo dell' Andrea and was completed in 1619, and the fountain was presumably supplied soon afterwards. A late 17th century writer records that there was formerly a bronze figure by Giambologna (1529-1608), sculptor to the Medici Grand Dukes of Tuscany, in the centre of the basin. The bronze cannot be identified with certainty. The original figure had already been replaced by the Bacchus seen here at the time of acquisition. this figure dates from the 18th or possibly early 19th century.",
