The God, whose head is crowned with vine leaves, stands naked with a cup in his right hand, (the bowl of which has been broken off) and his left hand resting on some clustered grapes and foliage over a tree trunk. Beneath the tree trunk there is a putto holding grapes and a basket full of grapes at his feet. \n\nThe statue's pose reveals the influence of Michelangelo's Bacchus, while its rococo style suggests it dates from the first half of the eighteenth century. This figure was described on acquisition as Venetian and may have been bought by Robinson in Venice.",
