The seat was painted in the Festival colours of yellow, blue, red or grey. Race's 'Springbok' stacking chair was also designed for the Festival. The 'Antelope' demonstrates the economic use of material and form. The delicate curvelinear outline and distinctive ball feet typify the contemporary or festival style of the early 1950s. The design gained an international reputation for Ernest Race. Like Race's BA3 chair, the 'Antelope' received a commendation at the 1954 Milan Triennale. The Race Furniture Ltd. put it in commercial production in the mid-1950s.",
