In China dragons are an extremely popular decorative motif, found on many different kinds of objects and materials. The dragon is regarded as a supernatural creature and is also one of the animals in the Chinese zodiac. It is the subject of numerous Chinese legends. The 'fish-dragon' motif relates to a folk tale in which a golden carp, after leaping up the 'dragon' falls, is transformed into a dragon and flies away. This is regarded as a metaphor for success.\n\nTime\nDuring the 14th century cobalt was imported into China from the Middle East, especially Iran. By the Qing dynasty (1644-1911), however, methods of processing local Chinese cobalt ores had been developed. Blue and white porcelain was exported in large quantities to the Middle East and to a lesser extent to the West.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThis dish was manufactured at the Jingdezhen kilns in Jiangxi Province. A large part of the production there consisted of blue and white wares. The cobalt blue pigment was painted directly on to the porcelain body, which was then covered in a clear glaze and fired at a temperature of between 1280 and 1350\u00baC.",
