Part of a tea service for six it  was described as 'a sugar bason ... octagon red pannel pattern'. It was used for small lumps of refined white sugar, which would have been served with tongs. Britain's sugar came from sugar cane plantations in the West Indies. In 1784 a French visitor to Britain noted that 'Sugar, even unrefined sugar ... is necessary [for tea] and very dear'. It  was also widely taken with coffee, as it counteracted the bitter taste.\n\nDesign & Designing\nBoth the octagonal shape and the painted decoration were inspired by a type of Japanese porcelain now known as 'Kakiemon'. The bulk of Kakiemon wares imported into Britain were made before about 1700. They were highly prized in mid-18th century Britain, when they were often described as 'Old Japan'.\n\nTime\nThere are several entries for octagonal wares in Chelsea sale catalogues of 1755 and 1756. The 1755 catalogue lists several 'Octagon old' or 'Octagon Old Japan' tea services, but there are none in the 1756 catalogue. This may indicate that the fashion for octagonal wares was in decline by 1756.",
