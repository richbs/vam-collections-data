His right hand is raised in blessing. In front of him is the cross bearing the bearded, long-haired figure of Christ, his head inclined to the left, wearing the torse and a loincloth. An orb is carved below Christ's feet. A Dove representing the Holy Ghost is perched on top of the cross. Two angels stand on brackets holding chalices under Christ's hands, and two more holding censers stand right and left at the top of the panel. An unusual feature is the mitred bishop or abbot, presumably the donor, who wears an alb and cloak and kneels on a cushion on the lower left of the panel. He presses a staff against his body with his right arm and holds a large heart in his hands, representing the symbolic offering of his heart to Christ. A scroll curves from his mouth toward the Dove.\n\nThe hands of God the Father are damaged. The angels in the top corners of the panel are damaged; heads, hands and censers are missing. The sides and corners of the panel are chipped and there is a break across the top right corner of the panel. The Dove's head is missing.\n\nThere are slight traces of gilding in the hair of God the Father and Christ. The back of the panel has been heavily cut away at the bottom. There are four lead-plugged holes with the remains of latten wires.",

In front of him is the cross bearing the bearded, long-haired figure of Christ and a Dove representing the Holy Ghost perched on the top of the cross. Two angels stand on brackets holding chalices under Christ's hands and two more holding censers stands right and left at the top of the panel. \n\nUnusually there is a mitred bishop or abbot, presumably the donor, who wears an alb and cloak and kneels on a cushion on the lower left of the panel. He presses a staff against his body with his right arms and holds a large heart in his hands, representing the symbolic offering of his heart to Christ. A scroll proceeds from his mouth towards the Dove. This design, incorporating a human figure holding a heart which he offers to the crucified Christ, is reminiscent of a South German woodcut.",
