Hard pastels resemble chalk in their effect and can most usefully be thought of as manufactured chalk.   The pastel painting technique of the eighteenth century, with its soft powdery quality, relied on soft pastels to create this effect.  Pastel was applied in layers, the artist using his fingers or cotton wool or a stump to blend areas of colour.\nHarder pastels were used differently, often sharpened to a point so as to obtain effects similar to those acheived by drawing.  These would be placed in a holder such as those held by sitters in the portraits of Gardiner and Hoare on display here.  The black outlines seen in this portrait and found in most of Hamilton's early pastels are either hard black pastel or natural black chalk.",
