He had by now mastered the medium, production was running smoothly and, absorbed in textile printing and dyeing, he was able to delegate. As well as working for Morris & Co. in other media, Faulkner designed wallpapers on her own account several of her patterns were issued by Jeffrey & Co. in the early 1880s. \n\nWith its small floral trails, the paper is not in the immediately recognisable \u2018Morris & Co.\u2019 style. This was perhaps an advantage in widening the range.'",
