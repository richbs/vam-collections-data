The doll has moulded and painted features and is of all-in-one construction apart from her jointed head and arms: she has blue eyes and long dark brown rooted nylon hair, the top of which is caught back with a blue thread.  She is moulded as wearing a round-necked white top with a fuchsia pink five-point star motif, and three-quarter length sleeves of bright blue; her short skirt is also of bright blue, and her high-heeled platform-soled shoes are fuchsia pink.  All her 'clothing' is of non-removable moulded vinyl except for a blue nylon fabric skirt worn over the moulded vinyl one.\nThe photograph frame is of moulded pink vinyl in the form of a stylized five-petalled flower, containing a slip-in picture roundel of Barbie, and with a small sheet of coloured stickers (mainly hearts, stars and crescent shapes) to decorate it.  The packaging consists of a translucent white vinyl holder for the doll, a paper slip showing the four dolls in the series, and a clear polythene bag for the photo frame, all contained within a clear polythene bag which is printed in black with safety warnings in various languages.",
