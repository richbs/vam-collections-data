But the leg is also closely similar to the left leg of the dead Christ in the Piet\u00e0 in St. Peter's in Rome.\n\nThe French word \u00e9corch\u00e9 literally means flayed or skinned. It has been adopted almost universally by scholars when speaking of a human figure stripped of its skin and thus displaying the superficial layers of muscles. Sculpted models or statuettes in which the muscles of the body are revealed (or \u00e9corch\u00e9s) first appeared in sixteenth century Europe, and in Italy primarily.",
