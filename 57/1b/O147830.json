The explosion in popularity of parlour music in the late 19th century, with a piano becoming a fixture in the home, led to the printing of famous songs from the music hall stage. This music sheet is one of many that were issued with the words and music of songs performed by the music hall star Marie Lloyd.\n\nMarie Lloyd (1870-1922) had a career spanning 40 years. She first appeared at the Eagle Tavern in London aged 15 as Bella Delmare, singing \u2018My Soldier Laddie\u2019. By 1885 she had become Marie Lloyd with her hit song \u2018The Boy I Love is Up in the Gallery\u2019. She was a huge success and topped the bill at the West End music halls. Her songs were full of innuendo and double meaning. \u2018She\u2019d never had her ticket punched before\u2019 and \u2018Oh Mr Porter what shall I do?\u2019 appeared innocent on first reading but took on a very saucy interpretation when performed by Miss Lloyd.",
