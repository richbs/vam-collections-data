This was designed and made for the Milan pharmacists' guild by Niccol\u00f2 da Varallo, one of the principal glass painters working in the cathedral in the late 15th century. Documents record that the project began in 1479.\n\nIn the mid 19th century a great deal of restoration work was carried out on the window. It seems that this panel and two others were removed. The other two panels are now in the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, Massachusetts. \n\nThe image on this panel shows the great theologian and monk St John of Damascus. He is pleading his innocence against the accusations of the seated Byzantine emperor, who had received a letter falsely incriminating him.  Below are the saint's words 'Testis est michi deus' ('God is my witness'). Other panels still in the window continue the story, where John's right hand is cut off and hung over the city gate. Finally, the Virgin Mary restores it to him. \n\nSt John of Damascus, a monk living in Syria, was born about 657 and died about 749. He opposed a decree of the Byzantine emperor, who was based in Constantinople (later called Istanbul), forbidding the veneration of holy images. St John's defence of images hinged upon his writings on the divine nature of Christ. Since God had taken human form, images were permissible.",

            "bibliography": "Williamson, Paul. <u>Medieval and Renaissance Stained Glass in the Victoria and Albert Museum. </u> London, 2003. ISBN 1851774041\nOn the east wall of the north transept of Milan Cathedral is a three-light window dedicated to the life of St John of Damascus, illustrating thirty scenes from his birth to death. The window has been restored on a number of occasions and in the mid-nineteenth century was comprehensively reordered by the Bertini workshop. The present panel and two others now in the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston were presumably removed at that time. The scene shows the great theologian and monk St John of Damascus (ca.657-ca.749) pleading his innocence against the accusations of the seated Byzantine Emperor, who had received a letter falsely incriminating him.  Below are the saint's words 'Testis est michi dens' ('God is my witness'). Other panels still in the window continue the story, where John's right hand is cut off and hung over the city gate, and finally restored to him by the Virgin after a vision. The window was designed and executed for the Milan pharmacists' guild by Niccolo da Varallo, one of the principal glass-painters working in the cathedral in the second half of the fifteenth century, and documents record that the project commenced in 1479.",
