This was intended, he said, \"as a monster big-city Daily Bugle with its scandals and scoops that you\u2019d find blowing in the streets at three in the morning.\" Klein had been a student of the painter Fernand Leger, whose advice had been to \"get out of the studio into the streets...to be monumental.\" Klein\u2019s work is monumental street art, far removed from the mainstream documentary style of the fifties. In 1958 Klein turned to film-making, only returning to photography in 1980.",
