            "history_note": "Bennett's execution of the desk shows his technical mastery, his inventive approach to structure, and his attraction to various materials. The piece is unusual as an example of studio furniture largely made of metal and plastic.  Bennett takes full advantage of the possibilities of aluminium, a very difficult material to work, to create a lightweight, strong and dramatically sculptural form - a paper thin top perched on four slim, wiggling legs. The use of ColorCore for the top connects the piece to one of the major 'design editing' phenomena of the decade, when the Formica company commissioned architects (such as Frank Gehry) and furniture makers to experiment with this new material. Unlike traditional plastic laminates is coloured all the way through its depth, making it ideal for cabinetmaking techniques.\nAccording to the maker's wife, Sylvia Bennett (correspondence 5 April 2011) the table was made over a period of years, from about 1985 to 1990. This is corroborated by Andy Lewis, the son of the owners, who noted that his parents had waited a long time for the object to be delivered (he said 'eight years,' correspondence 12 April 2011). This positions the piece in the latter half of the 1980s, Bennett's greatest decade of influence and productivity.\n\nHistorical significance: Garry Knox Bennett was the leading American studio furniture maker of the 1980s, and this one-off table is a superlative example of his work. It is somewhat unusual for him, in its lightness of form and relatively restrained use of colour. This is perhaps explained by the original commissioning clients, Sidney and Frances Lewis, who are among the most accomplished American collectors of Art Nouveau material.",
