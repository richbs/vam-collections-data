Firstly as a strictly circular mirror and secondly with the addition of the handle. \n\nThis is evident in that the lotus blossom-shaped attachment of the handle runs over the original inscription on the outer edge. There is a slightly blurred duplicate effect indicating a double casting. The position of the handle's attachment necessitates that the mirror is held at a horizontal angle in order to view the decoration and inscription straight on, which contradicts its own natural function.\n\nDepicted in the central roundel, and framed by an epigraphic (Kufic) frieze, is Zal being carried into the air by the Simorgh. The Simorgh is depicted as an eagle in heraldic posture with head turned to the left, wings outstetched and the long flowing tail curling upwards.\nThe wings are stylized in the Samanid convention. Each are divided into two halves by a band of beads enclosed by two fillets, the longer feathers being rendered by long incisions.\nZal is depicted as a standing figure in front of the bird. His arms are outstretched and bent upwards, holding on to a rope moulded over the head of the bird.\nPatina: red oxide and olive yellow on all the bas-relief parts that have been exposed to rubbing.",
