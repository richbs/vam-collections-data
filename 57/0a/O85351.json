These panels imitate the three-dimensional pattern called gadrooning found in Ottoman silverwork.\n\nThis jug was made in Iznik, north-west Anatolia, a well-known centre of ceramic production. The coloured ground here was a style that Iznik potters developed for some wares in the 1550s. They covered the body of the pot with coloured slips and added details of the design in slips of contrasting colours and paint. This development was associated with the appearance of a distinctive red slip in tilework of the same period.",

Details of the design were added in slips of contrasting colours, and paint. This development was associated with the appearance of a red slip in painted wares of the same period.\n\nThis jug is a fine example this phase of Iznik ceramics. Here the jug is a lovely salmon hue. The potter has painted white stripes down the neck and body to imitate the look of fluting on a metal jug.",
