The set was designed and worked to hang around the walls of the drawing room at Smeaton Manor, Northallerton, in North Yorkshire. The embroiderer, Mrs Ada Phoebe Godman, who lived at Smeaton Manor,  was the daughter of Isaac Lowthian Bell, a patron of William Morris. She commissioned Morris to produce a design for her to embroider, and her diary describes its delivery on 31 August 1877. An existing drawing of Mrs Godman  shows her still completing the embroideries in 1900.  \n\nOther examples are in the collections of the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, and the William Morris Gallery, Walthamstow, London. The design of repeating artichokes has a traditional structure and shows Morris's preoccupation in the 1870s and 1880s with Middle Eastern and early Italian silks and velvets. \n\nThe design did not remain exclusive to this client.  A pair of hangings from the same design were worked in silks by Mrs Margaret Beale and her daughters for their country home, Standen, in East Sussex.  The original design, inscribed 'Mrs Godman. Design for embroidered hanging (artichoke design)', was acquired by the V&A in 1898 before the Smeaton hangings were finished (museum no. 65-1898).",
