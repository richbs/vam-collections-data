Mimi and Ines were portrayed in engravings of 1755 and 1758 by Etienne Fessard after paintings by Christophe Huet. However, there is no reason to suppose that the box itself belonged to Madame de Pompadour as it was made in 1764, the year of her death and the engravings were in circulation from the mid 1750s. An alternative reading is that the dogs actually represent fidelity and companionship.\n\nThe box is set with roundels of enamel skillfully imitating the hardstone lapis lazuli.\n\nFran\u00e7ois-Nicolas G\u00e9nard was apprenticed to Louis Mailly in 1737 at the age of 14 but at Mailly's death, less than two years later, he moved to Simon Desormeaux. G\u00e9nard became a master goldsmith in 1754 and was sponsored by Noel Hardivilliers.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde  formed  one of the world\u2019s great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
