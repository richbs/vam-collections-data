It's Fine Art', an article written by Tom Morton, on the subject of the V&A's collection of comics. In the cartoon, Marf makes reference to the time she spent researching the comics collection at the V&A, and one of her characters, Carlo, is a member of V&A staff.  The strip appeared as three pages, of which this is one and the V&A holds the artwork for the other two (E.272:1-3-2005) and proofs of all three (E.273:1-3-2005).\n\nMarf is known for her cartoons for the Evening Standard, beginning in 2002 and moving to the 'Londoner's Diary' page in August 2003 and is also the arist behind the strip cartoon entitled 'Lucky'. She also worked for Canada's National Paper, The Globe and Mail in 2000. Her cartoon images appear on T-shirts, bags and scarves for Topshop.",
