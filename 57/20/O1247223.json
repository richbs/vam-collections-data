Samuel Begg originally worked in New Zealand and Australia but moved to London in the 1880s. In 1895 he joined the staff of the Illustrated London News and was employed by them as an illustrator until 1919.\n\nIn July 1899 Queen Victoria is reported to have 'ordered' George Sanger and his circus to come to Windsor Castle and the circus troop staged a costumed procession which included appearance by George Sanger's wife as Britiannia with a live lion on top of her coach to symbolise the nation's power and strength. \n\nThis item is one of several theatrical drawings from a collection of sketches commissioned from contemporary artists to be printed in illustrated magazines. The collection was donated to the museum by Sir William James Ingram in 1914.",
