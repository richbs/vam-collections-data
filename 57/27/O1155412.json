In the late 1960s he created psychedelic posters for many of the British and American bands of the time, and for underground magazine Oz. His influences came from the decorative and eroticised designs of Art Nouveau, combined with the melting rainbow colours of LSD visions and pop art inspirations from the post-war media; traces of Disney, horror movie monsters and comic book characters and can often be seen  hiding amongst the images.\n\nMr Tambourine Man is a song written and performed by Bob Dylan and featured on his 1965 album Bringing It All Back Home. It has become famous for its surrealistic imagery, influenced by artists as diverse as French poet Arthur Rimbaud and Italian filmmaker Federico Fellini. Interpretations of the lyrics have included a paean to drugs such as LSD, a call to the singer's muse, a reflection of the audience's demands on the singer, and even religious interpretations.",
