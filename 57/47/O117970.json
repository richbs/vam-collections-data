Born into a Jewish family in Frankfurt, she initially pursued an academic career before moving to Paris in 1930 to concentrate on photography. She emigrated from Paris to New York in 1941 and remained there after the war. This  was taken on a trip to Paris in 1952. Bing remarked on a stylistic change that had occured since the 1930s, attributing it to the war and her sense of isolation that developed in New York as an anonymous \u00e9migr\u00e9. She felt that she was \u2018in a vacuum\u2026looking out from the world as if from a space capsule\u2019. This photograph reveals a sense of that isolation and detachment. A close-up abstracted view of decaying leaves, it hints at the post-war depression and in its modernist concentration on patterns and space, also shows the influence of Bing\u2019s contemporary, the American photographer Andr\u00e9 Kert\u00e9sz.",
