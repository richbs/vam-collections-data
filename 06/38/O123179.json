The extras in the shot were asked to come the night before and spend the evening partying, drinking, smoking and having fun to create the right kind of atmosphere. Jim Lee then brought the girls in the next morning and set them against the seedy and well abused location. The contrast works well and enhances the girl's elegance.",

The photograph was taken in a boxing ring in the Bronx, New York and styled by Anna Wintour.  The photograph was taken on a Nikon F camera using an 85mm lens.  The lighting set up involved lighting the boxing ring from above and then the girls separately. The extras in the shot were asked to come the night before and spend the evening partying, drinking, smoking and having fun to create the right kind of atmosphere. Jim Lee then brought the girls in the next morning and set them against the seedy and well abused location. The contrast works well and enhances the girl's elegance.",

His great breakthrough was meeting the diva of fashion editors, Anna Wintour, at that time the assistant fashion editor at Harpers and Queen, who he regularly collaborated with to produce some of his best work, which continued years later after they both moved to New York.\nCentral to his work is the concept of telling stories which he creates using casts of three or three hundred and extraordinary locations and props. He has recently re-emerged as an active photographer working on numerous magazine editorials with top fashion stylists.\n\nRecently Jim Lee has moved seamlessly into directing TV commercials, his first film was for Levi\u2019s followed by several fashion and beauty commercials. In 2003/4 he had six photographs showing in the Ossie Clark retrospective at the Victoria and Albert Museum.\n\nsee also: http://www.jimleefilm.co.uk/",
