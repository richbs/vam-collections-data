This silver-gilt beaker containing a knife, fork and spoon  would have been vital for a prosperous person travelling in Britain. The handles of the spoon and fork unscrew and can be fitted in the wood and baize frame inside the beaker. The original knife handle would also have unscrewed, but the current blade is probably a 19th-century replacement. Forks were not generally used in Britain before the 17th century. Travellers in the 1590s noted that the English tended to 'throw their food into the mouth as you would toss hay into a barn'..\n\nThe set would also have included a nutmeg grater, a spice box and a corkscrew, but these no longer survive.\n\nPeople\nThe cutlery and beaker bear the mark 'TT' beneath a coronet, which may be the mark of the goldsmith Thomas Tysoe (active 1690-1700).\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe beaker and cutlery handles are beautifully engraved with floral scrolls. The beaker has a putto (cherub) on one side. On the other,  we see two winged figures holding a blank escutcheon (heraldic shield), which may possibly have been intended for an inscription or a coat of arms.",
