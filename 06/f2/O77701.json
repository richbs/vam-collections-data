Almost all the parts are carved in the form of the letter S, apart from the sides of the chair-back and some of the stretchers below the seat.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe decoration on the stretcher between the front legs, as with many chairs of this date, is identical to that running along the top of the chair-back. It is formed of two scrolls framing a crowned rose.  Roses and crowns were frequently used in this way on chairs, to suggest loyalty to the King and country.  The rose was the symbol of England.\n\nMaterials & Making\nCaned chair seats and backs were introduced in Britain in the 1660s. The fashion derived from imported Indian chairs, and the cane was imported from East Asia by the East India Company. Cane was cheap and chairs with cane seats tended to be light and portable.  Seat or 'squab' cushions were generally used over the cane, for comfort and to protect the cane.",
