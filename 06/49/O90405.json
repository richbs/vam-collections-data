Socketed candlesticks made their appearance in the late 13th century and gradually replaced the earlier pricket form, at least for domestic use. The earliest sockets were polygonal in cross-section; by the 15th century they were round. \n\nThe form of the stem and base of candlesticks at this time is the result of a complicated interplay between two typological currents. The first type naturally evolved from the simple European pricket candlestick, where the shaft is supported on three legs. The second type originated in the Near East and had a high cylindrical or slightly conical base surmounted by a flat circular wax pan and a short circular stem. These candlesticks were introduced into Europe by the Muslim community in Venice from the 14th century.\n\nBroadly speaking the development of the base of European candlesticks can be attributed to foreign influence, while the stem, which gradually became longer, with an increasingly complicated range of knops and balusters, is largely European in origin.",
