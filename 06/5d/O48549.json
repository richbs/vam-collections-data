            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nSpecific cutlery for eating fish evolved in the early 19th century.  In 1838 a book of etiquette for ladies recorded that, 'in first rate society, silver knives are now beginning to be used for fish: a very pleasing, as well as decided step in the progress of refinement.' People no longer used steel knives and forks, as the steel was said to react with acids in the fish sauces and taint the flavour of the food. Fish knives and forks were commonly called 'fish eaters' or 'fish-eating knives and forks'.\n\nDining Etiquette\nThe complicated dining etiquette of the Victorian era encouraged the development of utensils for eating particular foods. The proper use of cutlery formed an important and often lengthy section in all the etiquette manuals. As the century progressed, the rules for the use of some cutlery changed, reflecting the refinements that began to differentiate the manners and status of 'old' and 'new' money. The development of fish eaters is a good example of this. Until the 1880s manuals recommended that fish be eaten using two ordinary table forks or one fork and a piece of bread. Middle-class families would have bought the newly developed utensils, such as fish eaters, marking them out from those who already owned more traditional sets of cutlery. In some circles the innovative cutlery designs were never accepted and have remained a subject for prejudice and exclusion to this day: 'I take him to a French restaurant in the posh bit of Battersea ...We have Dover sole while he gets depressed about the fish knives. \"Another ghastly Victorian improvement. No decent home would have fish knives ...\" ' (Daily Mail, July 1998).\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe fork handle is in the King's pattern  the most popular cutlery design in the 19th century and still made today.",

            "historical_context_note": "<b>Object Type</b><br>\nSpecific cutlery for eating fish evolved in the early 19th century.  In 1838 a book of etiquette for ladies recorded that, 'in first rate society, silver knives are now beginning to be used for fish: a very pleasing, as well as decided step in the progress of refinement.' People no longer used steel knives and forks, as the steel was said to react with acids in the fish sauces and taint the flavour of the food. Fish knives and forks were commonly called 'fish eaters' or 'fish-eating knives and forks'.<br><br>\n\n<b>Dining Etiquette</b><br>\nThe complicated dining etiquette of the Victorian era encouraged the development of utensils for eating particular foods. The proper use of cutlery formed an important and often lengthy section in all the etiquette manuals. As the century progressed, the rules for the use of some cutlery changed, reflecting the refinements that began to differentiate the manners and status of 'old' and 'new' money. The development of fish eaters is a good example of this. Until the 1880s manuals recommended that fish be eaten using two ordinary table forks or one fork and a piece of bread. Middle-class families would have bought the newly developed utensils, such as fish eaters, marking them out from those who already owned more traditional sets of cutlery. In some circles the innovative cutlery designs were never accepted and have remained a subject for prejudice and exclusion to this day: 'I take him to a French restaurant in the posh bit of Battersea ...We have Dover sole while he gets depressed about the fish knives. \"Another ghastly Victorian improvement. No decent home would have fish knives ...\" ' (<i>Daily Mail</i>, July 1998).<br><br>\n\n<b>Design & Designing</b><br>\nThe fork handle is in the King's pattern, the most popular cutlery design in the 19th century and still made today.",
