Private Lives opened at the Apollo Theatre, London, on 1 November 1944. The hotel terrace setting shown in published photographs of that production does not correspond to this design, which may be for a later revival. The play was presented in 1946 at Wimbledon Theatre and was given a British tour in 1949. It was also staged in the USA but the lack of export or customs stamps on the design suggests that it was not made for the 1946 USA tour or for the 1948 New York revival.\n\nGladys Calthrop (1894-1980) was an English set and costume designer. Born Gladys Treeby in Devon, she married, and later separated from, Everard E. Calthrop. She met Noel Coward in Italy during 1921, they subsequently became friends and worked together on many plays. Their first collaboration was on The Vortex in 1924 for which Calthrop designed both sets and costumes. She worked in both London and New York.",
