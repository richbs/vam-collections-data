            "public_access_description": "This cabinet was designed by a Mr Crosse, about whom nothing further is known, and made by the firm Wright and Mansfield.  Wright and Mansfield specialised in the production of furniture based on English eighteenth-century designs.  This cabinet is typical of the fashionable furniture revival in the 1870s and 1880s known as the \u2018Adams\u2019 style.  \n\nInfluenced by the work of the eighteenth-century architect and designer Robert Adam, the \u2018Adams\u2019 style\u2019 was characterised by the use of a combination of classical motifs, such as ram\u2019s heads, urns and swags, and eighteenth-century techniques such as marquetry and occasionally the incorporation of decorative Wedgwood plaques.  All these features can be seen on the Wright and Mansfield cabinet.\n\nThe cabinet was exhibited at the 1867 Exposition Universelle in Paris where it was the only piece of British furniture to be awarded a gold medal.  It was praised for the high quality of its materials and workmanship and seen as very \u2018English\u2019 owing to the use of satinwood and Neo-classical decoration.  Originally valued at \u00a31,400, it was bought by the Museum in 1868 at a reduced price of \u00a3800.",

Sala, Notes and Sketches of the Paris Exhibition, London 1868, pp.351-2.\n'Messrs Wright and Mansfield have a very sumptuous armoire cabinet in the English Louis style, of satinwood, elaborately inlaid with coloured woods, and panelled with delicious little slabs of Wedgwood ware in pale blue and white. The cabinet is the sunniest and gracefullest thing imaginable; but it is just the shadow of a shade too light and jocund. It looks as though it had been made to be eaten; and although it may contain some day \"sugar and spice, and all that's nice,\" you don't want to eat your cupboard.'\nRamond, Pierre. La Marqueterie.
