Floors and walls, especially in the warm regions of central and southern Iran, were furnished with pavements and friezes of glazed tiles. Here the design was as popular as it was versatile and could be extended to cover all sizes of surface and provided a good base for carpets. Similar designs are seen on the floor tiles in Qavam House, also  known as Narenjestan e Ghavam, a traditional and historical house of an upper class merchant family in Shiraz, Iran, built between 1879 and 1886, by Mirza Ibrahim Khan. The Qavam were merchants from Qazvin. \n\nSee also 1531D-1876, and 1531 Lost OK 89.",
