Inscribed on the back in graphite: Lord Brooke; and in another hand: by Cooper.  \n \n<b>Frame:</b> Nineteenth-century copper-gilt rim of V-section holding a convex glass in a rebate; the back closed by a toothed copper strip; the hanger a small half-round ring.  \n \n<b>Provenance:</b> In 1889, collection of Edwin H Lawrence, subsequently called E Durning Lawrence, from whom purchased, 1892.  \n \n<b>Literature:</b> Williamson 1904, vol. I, pp. 51-2, pl. XXVII, no. 3 (as by Cooper but the repro. captioned as by Mrs Rosse); <i>Catalogue of Miniatures</i>, 1908, p. 8, fig. 14 (A Gentleman); Foster 1914-16, II, p. 15, no. 32 (as Robert, 3rd Lord Brooke); Long 1930, p. 12 (as Possibly Robert Greville, 2nd Baron Brooke); Foskett 1974, p. 121 (following Long, but adding 'unsigned'); <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 9. \n\nThough the miniature has been in unsatisfactory condition for most of the last 100 years, the attribution to Cooper has not been questioned. Long, in allowing that the sitter might be the 2nd Baron Brooke, by implication dated the portrait before 1643, a period of Cooper's oeuvre from which there are few extant examples. This very early date could explain some aspects of the style that would be anomalous if the portrait belonged in the late 1640s, which is where it would naturally be placed. However, the sharp gouache hatching in the face might well be by the restorer's hand, and certainly no conclusions should be drawn concerning Cooper's early style on this basis; nor should stylistic anomaly be seen as corroborative of an early dating.  \n \nAs for the sitter, Foster's Robert, 3rd Lord Brooke is nonsense, since the 3rd Baron was called Francis and was not a soldier; the 4th Baron, younger brother of Franc is, was called Robert, but he was not born until c.1638. Robert, the 2nd Baron and Parliamentary General, is the only candidate possible of the three Lords Brooke, and this miniature seems to resemble the portrait of the 2nd Baron at Warwick. (1) Apart from the direction of the sitter's gaze, and the tendrils of hair on the forehead in the Cooper, the heads are similar. Beyond this, portraits said to be of Brooke are:  \n \n1 Three-quarter length attributed to Dobson at Warwick, (2) c.1640. \n2 Half-length facing left, in 1936 in a private collection in London, (3) c.1640. \n3 Engraving after I, published 1 February 1824 by Harding, Mavor and Lepard, engraved by R Cooper. \n4 Engravings of a separate and earlier type, showing the sitter with Van Dyck beard and moustache; anonymous engraver, published as a plate for Anthony \u00e0 Wood's <i>History of the Rebel1ion</i> (1713). \n5 A miniature identified as the 2nd Baron Brooke, lent by the Earl of Warwick to South Kensington 1865 (no. 1947), is clearly a good Cooper of c.1660-5 and therefore cannot be of Brooke.  \n \nLord Brooke was killed, in an accident that still raises the morale of monarchists, by a shot in the eye as he directed the 1643 attack on the fortified Cathedral Close in Lichfield. The story is that he had just prayed to be 'presently cut off' if his cause were not right; the date was 2 March, the feast of St Chad (d.672/3), (4) 1st Bishop of Lichfield and patron saint of the Cathedral.  \n \n1 Engraved by WT Fry (after a drawing by W Hilton) for the 1817 edition of Lodge's Portraits. \n2 Photo NPG; but the sitter is Colonel John Russell, and the artist is Hayls. \n3 Photo NPG. \n4 NPG archive.\"",
