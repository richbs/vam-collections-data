Responding to specific locations in the Museum, the architects explored themes such as study, work, play, performance and contemplation. Seven of the proposals were then selected for construction at full-scale.\n\nThese projects promoted an attitude to architecture where to 'dwell' meant something more than simply to find shelter. Each building invited the participation of the viewer. These immersive environments reawakened people's ability to inhabit architectural space on both a physical and an emotional level.\n\nConsisting of inter-connected performance booths set around a spiral staircase, this project is a test site for newly devised live commissions. The staircase can operate as a corridor, as seating, or as a stage. A number of framing devices exist, including red curtains at the booth entrances and the steel mesh screens and acrylic windows which allow a view into the structure.",
