Although ivory, wood and stone are relatively easy to carve, other materials such as gemstones are much more demanding. Most of these carvings were made for wealthy patrons and collectors, who delighted in the rarity of the material and quality of the carving. This piece was made and decorated on a lathe, perhaps by a wealthy amateur craftsman. Ivory turning was a fashionable hobby at this period.\nThe lack of figurative carving means that it is hard to date precisely, but its shape suggests it dates from the second half of the seventeenth century. It is likely to originate from Germany, where many turned vessels were made at that date, although its exact place of origin remains uncertain.",
