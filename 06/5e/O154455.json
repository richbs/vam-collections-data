It is best described in the artist's own words.  \"The seafood server was forged from a sheet of 14 gauge sterling silver using cross peen and silversmithing hammers.  The undulating appearance is intended to summon thoughts of moving water mingled with sea life forms.  A forty ounce cross peen hammer was used to lay in the wide heavy marks that encouraged the rippling of the metal.  Small domed shaped hammers and featherweight cross peens provided texture that changes from scale like to sheet smooth.  The outer sides of the piece move towards one another in what might be dancing waves or the meeting of wave and whale form.  This juncture is the grasping place when the server is used to scoop fare such as shrimp or small clams.  The server can also be grasped at either end to accommodate the left or right hand.  The underside is satin finished to contrast against the high polish of the piece, as sand contrasts against water.\"",
