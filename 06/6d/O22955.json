On the advice of the art gallery owner Robert Fraser, Peter Blake and Jann Haworth, both fine artists, were involved to create a set with a crowd watching the Sgt. Pepper's Band.

Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band</i>. The Beatles. Des: M. C. Productions & The Apple staged by Peter Blake (b.1932) & Jann Haworth. Photo: Michael Cooper. Offset lithography. Parlophone EMI. \nPr. & manufactured: Garrod & Lofthouse Ltd., 1967. E.577-1985. \nNow the most celebrated \u2018underground\u2019 record and sleeve design ever issued, <i>Sgt. Pepper</i> was originally mixed for mono release and was nearly sold (at Epstein\u2019s suggestion), in a plain cover to avoid any possible litigation. The design was conceived as a montage celebration of the celebrity, calling upon the pop art-fine art talents of Blake and Howarth to inject a certain monumentality into what may otherwise have been a work of lesser moment. \nThe record is not strictly a concept album like those with strong lyrical or narrative content which followed in the 1970s, yet the special unity and self-importance achieved through track linkage, carefully chosen popular and counter-cultural iconography does impart an operatic air of consistent thematic treatment. \nIncluded in the package was a separate coloured \u2018cut-out\u2019 sheet of moustache and sergeant stripes, an idea first aired in <i>Ark</i>, The Royal College of Art magazine. \n<i>Their Satanic Majesties Request</i>. The Rolling Stones. Des: & Photo: Michael Cooper. (Back cover illus: Tony Meeviwiffen). Offset lithography. Decca. Pr: Robert Stare, England. 1967. E.576-1985. \nThe central image is printed on a faceted sheet of plastic to create a pseudo three-dimensional effect. The set was built by the Rolling Stones, Michael Cooper and Archie at Pictorial Productions, Mount Vernon, NY. It is a direct ripost to the Peter Blake <i>Sgt. Pepper</i> sleeve for the Beatles, released in the same year. This design, together with the music within illustrates how even a group of such a well-defined self-image as the Stones could not resist experimenting with the ubiquitous psychedelic and eastern influences of the time\u2019",

Considered the first concept album it is recorded as though it is a performance by a mythical band rather than by the Beatles themselves. This is reflected in the cover. Peter Blake, a painter, decided on the novel approach of creating a stage set, where the Beatles (waxworks from Madame Tussaud's) join their heroes (lifesize photographs) and crowd around the band. Its innovatory and colourful design also meant that fans would spend more time looking at the cover: identifying portraits, reading the first full set of printed lyrics on a record sleeve, and examining the free gift - a cardboard insert of cut-outs, including a moustache and badges: the badges were apparently to be found stapled to the back pockets of fans' jeans.\n\n[Julia Bigham, 'British Design at Home', p.148]",
