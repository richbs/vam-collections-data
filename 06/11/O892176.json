The following is the full text of the entry: MARATTA,CARLO (1625-1713) 738 The Marriage of the Virgin Inscribed in ink in a later hand 'B.B.L' and 'FL' Point of the brush and dark brown wash heightened with white; the outlines indented with the stilus 10 x 7 (254 x 177) D.1012-I900 PROVENANCE Dr H. Wellesley (according to a note on the back of the mount); Dalton Bequest 1900 LITERATURE Dalton Catalogue, p. 13 (as by Francesco Vanni) The technique, not often used by Maratta, has a parallel in a drawing of the Visitation in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford (Parker, Ashmolean Catalogue, no. 900, pl. 196). Two pictures by Maratta are based on our composition: (a) in S. Isidoro, Rome; painted in 1652, destroyed in 1798 and replaced with a copy; (b) a picture that served as a model for a mosaic in the Santuario della S. Casa at Loreto. In both pictures the composition is reversed. Another drawing showing the same scene, also reversed, is in the Albertina (Albertina Catalogue, 3, 1932, no. 781). The subject was engraved by Robert van Audenaert, with other figures and an architectural background added (Le Blanc, I, p. 67, no. 15). Mr Pouncey and Dr Schaar kindly drew my attention to the pictures at Loreto and in S. Isidoro.",
