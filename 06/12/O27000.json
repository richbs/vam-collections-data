Some pieces might interlock, but most of the puzzle was just pushed into place. This meant that it would not stay in one piece very easily. To solve this, the outer edges of some puzzles, like this example, had interlocking pieces that would hold the whole puzzle together.\n\nMany 19th-century puzzles were made for educational purposes. This puzzle is a times-table of old pence, which translates pennies into shillings. The illustrations are from stories, fables and nursery rhymes, including \u2018Old Mother Hubbard\u2019.",
