London: The Victoria and Albert Museum in association with Hurtwood Press, 1983.\nThe full entry of the text is as follows:\n\n\"<i>Clementina, Viscountess Hawarden   British   1822-65\nPhotographic study   early 1860s\nAlbumen print from wet collodion negative\n236 X 268 mm   Mus. no. 324-1948 </i><sub>(although the number in this book is wrong- the number marked on CMS and on image itself is 324-1947)</sub>\n<i>Given by Lady Clementina Tottenham</i>\n\nLady Hawarden's photographs are often remarkable for their lighting, and this is no exception.  Unlike Mrs Cameron, who so often used diffused, rather flat lighting, Lady Hawarden has here made use of strong sunlight falling on her sitter from a window.  Such circumstances normally lead to an intolerably wide range of contrast between highlight and shadow.  The shadow side of the sitter's face is lit by reflected light from the tabletop, and this 'fill-in' lighting has kept the contrast within acceptable limits.  The albumen print has not been gold toned, and shows the consequently very yellowed highlights.\nThe title of this photograph is the one used by the photographer in the catalogues of the exhibitions in which she showed in her lifetime.  Her mentor in photography appears to have been the High Art photographer Oscar Rejlander, who wrote after her death: 'She was an earnest believer in the progress of photography, and that it could be used as an art and abused like a daub.  She worked honestly, in a good, comprehensible style.  She aimed at elegant and, if possible, idealised truth' (<i>The British Journal of Photography</i>, 27 January 1865). Lady Hawarden belongs, like Mrs Cameron, to the second wave of amateur photographers - which emerged when the technological problems of the albumen/collodion combination had been solved and materials more or less standardised.  Her work received critical praise (including that of Lewis Carroll).  Her photographs are mostly figure compositions taken in her photography room on the first floor of her house in Prince's Gate, South Kensington.  This photograph demonstrates her interest in bold lighting effects of a kind impermissible in professional portrait photography of the period, arrangements of pattern, and luxurious costume.  Her models were her three daughters and son.",
