They may still have been drunk from on ceremonial occasions, but were now more important as objects for display and as fine gifts passed between gentlemen.\n\nDecoration\nThis cup and cover are of a standard symmetrical form. It has, however, been overlaid with elaborate decoration, transforming it into a thoroughly contemporary display piece of the early Rococo phase. A Bacchic theme, referring to the cup's original function as a ceremonial drinking vessel (Bacchus was the god of wine), can be seen in the engraved scenes around the upper part of the body. This theme is further emphasised by the scrolled strapwork and fruiting vine decoration around the body, foot and cover, terminating in the boldly-modelled basket of grapes serving as the finial.\n\nWorkshop Practices\nThere are a number of very similar cups and covers by different makers which date to the late 1730s and early 1740s, suggesting not only close cooperation between leading goldsmiths, but the possibility that a single workshop made all the cups, or at least the casting models, and supplied them to different makers.\n\nTax\nThis cup is a 'duty dodger', a piece that was not submitted to the Assay Office for hallmarking, therefore avoiding the excise duty price of 6d per ounce payable at assay. The saving in this instance would have been a considerable \u00a32.10s, as this cup and cover weigh 101 troy ounces. George Wickes was one of a number of eminent goldsmiths who practised duty-dodging.",
