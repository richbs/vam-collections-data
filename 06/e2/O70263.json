            "public_access_description": "This sculpture is one of the most famous pieces in the Victoria and Albert Museum. We are not sure who modelled it. Andrea del Verrocchio, Leonardo da Vinci and Desiderio da Settignano are among a variety of 15th century Florentine sculptors who may have made it. It is true that the Christ Child resembles Desiderio's work. But the emphasis on the human relationship between mother and child and the naturalistic treatment of the subject are typical of the time.\n\nThe style of the terracotta is similar to Antonio Rossellino's work. In particular, it resembles the Virgin and Child on the Cardinal of Portugal's tomb in San Miniato al Monte in Florence. Rossellino made this about 1461-1466. The statuette in the V&A was probably a sketch model for a life-size marble group. The group was probably similar to the Madonna del Latte on the Nori Monument in the church of Santa Croce, Florence. Dated 1478, this was one of Rossellino's late works. Antonio Rossellino was the most important member of a family of sculptors. Most of his works are in his native Florence, but some survive in other towns, such as Prato and Naples. You can see his first signed work, the bust of Giovanni Chellini, dated 1456, in the V&A.",

            "history_note": "This sculpture, one of the most celebrated pieces in the Victoria and Albert Museum, has been attributed to a variety of fifteenth-century Florentine sculptors, including Verrocchio, Leonardo da Vinci and Desiderio da Settignano. The Christ Child is certainly reminiscent of Desiderio's work, but the naturalistic  intimacy of the figures is typical of the treatment of the subject at the time, emphasising the human relationship between mother and child. The present terracotta is stylistically similar to other work by Antonio Rossellino, notably the Virgin and Child on the monument to the Cardinal of Portugal in San Miniato al Monte in Florence of about 1461-66. The statuette was probably a sketch-model for a life-size marble group similar to the Madonna del Latte on the Nori Monument in Santa Croce, Florence (1478), a late work by the artist. The works of Antonio Rossellino, the most important member of a family of sculptors, can mainly be found in his native Florence, but some survive in other centres, such as Prato and Naples.  His first signed work, the bust of Giovanni Chellini (dated 1456), can also be seen in the Museum.",
