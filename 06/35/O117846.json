Born into a Jewish family in Frankfurt, she initially pursued an academic career before moving to Paris in 1930 to concentrate on photography. Ilse Bing (1899-1998) uses the horse to explore the effects of solarisation. Solarisation happens when negatives are exposed to light in the darkroom during developing and printing, producing partly reversed images. Bing\u2019s experiments developed from an interest in light; as she explained, at the time, \u2018light was considered the medium that permits photography. But for me it became the main subject: the protagonist of my photography\u2019. Bing liked to remove objects from their context, concentrating on the abstract, expressive qualities that materialised in her photographs. The Surrealists called this effect \u2018d\u00e9paysement\u2019 (removal from the natural sphere).",
