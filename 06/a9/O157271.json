All four edges have been cut back to form a rebate (11-12mm wide, 7mm deep). A canvas strip has been glued along the bottom edge lip, and there is a hole at the centre of the top edge lip with the remains of a peg. On the front are extensive exposed common furniture beetle channels and possibly some traces of pigment (bottom edge, centre) suggesting that the panel may have been painted, and stripped.",

It is likely that comparatively little medieval, domestic furniture survived intact beyond 1600, but during the 19th century there was a thriving market in fragments, such as panels and the fronts of chests, which were sometimes re-used in replica or fake medieval furniture. This piece was carved in solid oak, and includes three fleurs-de-lis, one of the symbols used on the royal arms of France, although its use does not necessarily mean that the panel was made for a royal household. Exposed channels on the surface of the panel were made by Common Furniture Beetle larvae (woodworm) and may suggest that the panel was originally painted, and later stripped.\n\nThe panel was one of ninety-six pieces of architectural decoration collected by the architect A. W. N. Pugin. They served as models to be used in the Thames Bank workshops for the decoration and furnishing of the new Palace of Westminster, and were later transferred from the Office of Works to the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert Museum).",
