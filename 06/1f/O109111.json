On the outside of the silver is an appled layer of red enamel. Pinned  to the red enamel are silvergilt 'flames' which symbolise the flames from the burning bush on Mt Sinai. In between the flames are strips of silver which arch over the enamel and rise to the top of the crown where there is a smaller crown with bells attached.

            "public_access_description": "In Judaism the Torah (the scroll containing the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Hebrew Bible) is usually decorated with either a crown or a pair of finials. The crown symbolises majesty and the Law. \n\nThe maker of this brilliantly executed crown was the eminent silversmith, Professor Gerald Benney. Although he was not Jewish himself, Benney began to make Jewish ceremonial objects in the 1960s, in a contemporary style. Here he has used red enamel to symbolise the burning bush that Moses saw in the desert and 12 gemstones to represent the 12 tribes of Israel.",

In the late 19th century ceremonial silver was available through large companies such as Joseph & Horace Savory and cherished pieces were brought into England by the Jews who had fled the pogroms in Eastern Europe. In the first half of the 20th century the two world wars and the Holocaust meant that little Jewish silver was produced. It was not until Jewish communities had become more established that synagogues began to commission new work. The designers were often non-Jewish, as was Professor Gerald Benney, the eminent silversmith who began to make ceremonial objects in contemporary styles in the 1960s. More recently a new generation of silversmiths, including Tamar de Vries Winter, have continued to make ritual objects. Their work has enabled traditional Jewish religious customs and practices to be fulfilled in a modern style.",
