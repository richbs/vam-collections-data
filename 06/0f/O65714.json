The techniques and motifs used are found on Islamic metalwork at this period, such as the scrolling arabesques and running animals in the borders. The human figures, too, are depicted in an \u2018Islamic\u2019 fashion. But they are clearly Christians, because they swing censers and carry crosses in a baptismal procession. The lid of the casket is a later addition.",

All of them have been attributed to workshops in Syria and Egypt on the grounds that a number of formal devices common to those areas during the first half of the 13th century are characteristic of these objects. The figures are precisely drawn, they have sharp undercut edges and they are usually set against elaborately worked backgrounds of tight arabesques, scrolls or interlacing swastikas. Also characteristic of this group is the fact that their iconographic repertoire, while Christian in theme, departs from the established pictorial traditions of the medieval Christian world. This is due to the political environment of the area in which they were made, and in fact their decorative program is quite typical of Ayyubid Islamic iconography.",
