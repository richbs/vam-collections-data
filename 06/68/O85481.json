            "public_access_description": "This candlestick imitates the silver styles inspired by ancient Greek and Roman architecture. Such Neo-classical sticks were extremely popular from about 1765. The stem of this candlestick encloses a rod which pushes up to eject the candle. The reddish tone of the metal is due to the high copper content in the brass.\n\nProduction of candlesticks wassimplified in the 18th century by the development of casting the stem in one piece using a removable core, a process called hollow core casting. This allowed for a much finer and thinner casting to be made for both the base and the stem. It also encouraged the development of the multi-faceted candlestick form in the early 19th century, which was only made in brass. \n\nThe use of hollow core castings changed the method of extraction of the candle stump. The most frequent method of removal in use from the early 18th century onwards was a push-rod extractor, which this example has. It consisted of a disc in the nozzle connected by an iron rod passing through the hollow stem to a brass button under the base.",

ISBN 1851773088.\nA number of the large individual collections bequeathed to the Museum- notably those assembled by John Jones and George Salting- contained many related objects that were already understood as series through which it was possible to trace the development of  a particular type of artifact or style. Although the seemingly comprehensive nature of such collections was of course illusory, the Museum's holdings of vast numbers of like materials nonetheless made it possible to display row after row of similar objects, thus representing visual typologies. These typological displays, which were much indebted to anthropological models of the era, are exemplified by this series of brass candlesticks. Such massed groups of objects that, taken individually, have never been regarded as \"\"masterpieces,\"\" form an important facet of the Museum's collections and are still a significant part of its displays (fig.79).\nThese candlesticks represent but a small fraction of what is one of the most comprehensive collections in existence. They range in style from plain medieval forms found in excavations to finely engraved Venetian candlesticks of the sixteenth century, and present a history of the domestic candlestick from the twelfth to the nineteenth century.\nMuch of the interest in ordinary domestic brass and copper wares was stimulated by the English Arts and Crafts movement around 1900, and the emergence of candlesticks as a category of collector's item, with a growing literature, is really a twentieth century phenomenon, developing after the candlestick was no longer an essential domestic object. The Museum, however, had already begun collecting in this field as early as 1855.\n\nANTHONY R.E. NORTH",
