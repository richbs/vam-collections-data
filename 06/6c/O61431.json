It was probably designed by George Jack, who from 1880 worked as the assistant to the firm\u2019s chief furniture designer, Philip Webb.  Jack took over from Webb after his retirement in 1890.  Although there is no definite evidence that Jack designed the chair, the wavy outlines of the vertical rails under the arms are reminiscent of details on a sideboard designed by Jack and shown by Morris & Company at the Manchester Jubilee Exhibition in 1887.\n\nThe chair is covered in Utrecht Velvet (a stamped mohair plush), which has faded from its original olive-green colour. The fabric was sold in a number of colourways, for seat upholstery.",
