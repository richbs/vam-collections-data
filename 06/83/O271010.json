The original design was woven in two scales - 'Crown Imperial' a woven cotton fabric with a repeat of 15.72 inches x 10 inches (40 cms x 42.5 cms), and in woven wool and mohair, called 'Mohair Damask', with a smaller repeat. Although these later reproductions are woven in wool, they more closely resemble the larger scale design. The pattern is picked out in two colours and shows an ogee repeating motif of large Crown Imperial lily heads.\n\nThe fabric was woven in West Germany for the American firm of Unika-Vaev, who specialised in contract work for offices and other large-scale interiors. The firm has also been responsible for reproductions of Wiener Werstatte fabrics, and the factory responsible for the re-weaving of the Morris and the Austrian designs is the same as was originally used for the Wiener Werstatte fabrics.\n\nEach sample has an identifying label attached to it giving technical details of each piece.\n\nWoven to a width of 51 inches (129.5 cms) and the fabric is 100% wool.",
