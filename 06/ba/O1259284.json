The central image depicts a simple brown wooden fishing boat being launched from the beach into the waves, by three men wearing white loincloths and red hats. There appears to be a pile of fishing nets in the centre of the boat. One of the men is standing on the boat, while another kneels and the final man pushes the boat into the waves. The bottom three quarters of the design is taken up by the sea while the top quarter depicts the sky. In the top left corner are the words \u2018Sea-Fisher\u2019 in black, whilst \u2018WIMCO\u2019 in black is within a white diamond, in the top right. At the bottom of the design are the words \u2018Safety Matches\u2019 with \u2018Made in India\u2019 underneath. The whole design is enclosed within thin black and thicker beige borders.",

These small boxes, sold for a few pence, are bold and colourful, some simple and na\u00efve, others more complex and detailed. The images range from gods and goddesses, women, flowers, fruits, monuments, transport, tools, consumer goods and more. Successful covers are continuously copied and there can be endless variations of one particular image produced by rival companies. Many covers have a \u2018retro\u2019 feel about them because of this copying process, this also makes them difficult to date.  Despite their ephemeral nature, they can convey historical, political and social information.  Matchbox art dates back to the 1920s when India began producing its own matches from factories in Calcutta  in Bengal and Sivakasi in Tamil Nadu. Prior to this, matches were imported from Europe, mainly Sweden, and Japan. Early images reflect themes of nationalism while more recent images include planes, motorcycles and trucks.",
