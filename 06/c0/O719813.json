Crace at 14 (later 38) Wigmore Street, London, 1849.\n\nAt around 1849 it would seem that Pugin was trying to set up a business partnership between himself and Crace. He devoted much time to supplying Crace with designs for furniture to be made up and sold by the firm and at his persuasion  Crace built a factory at the back of the Wigmore Street house to make furniture, which included many of Pugin's gothic designs. The partnership scheme however was unsuccessful and Crace's existing showroom in the French Renaissance manner remained unaltered from 1838 until the whole was pulled down in 1899. \n\nAugustus Welby Northmore Pugin (1812-52) is widely considered as one of the most significant and influential architects, designers and theorists of the 19th century. Following his conversion to Catholicism in 1835, he identified the Gothic style with Christian architecture and his work and writings inspired and framed the Gothic Revival. In 'Contrasts', published in 1836, he condemned classical forms and ardently praised 14th and 15th-century architecture. Pugin is best remembered for his work on the Palace of Westminster.",
