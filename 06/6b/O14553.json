It was probably intended as a burial accessory for one of the many large tombs built in Japan in the 6th century AD. Similar vessels with rounded bottoms have been found with tall supporting stands. The marks visible on the exterior reveal that the jar was made by joining together a series of coils of clay which were then beaten into shape with a textured paddle. The flow of air into the kiln was controlled so that only a limited amount of oxygen could enter. This resulting reduced atmosphere caused the iron-rich clay to turn a greyish black colour. The deep green splash of glaze which defines the front of the jar is the chance result of flying ash from the wood fuel settling and melting on the pot surface during firing. These features are characteristic of ceramics known as Sue wares. The technology for making these wares was introduced into Japan from Korea at the turn of the 5th century AD.",
