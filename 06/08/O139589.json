One of a new generation of British sculptors to emerge in the early 1980s, in his early work Woodrow created installations from abandoned domestic objects such as washing machines and vacuum cleaners; later he worked with welded steel constructions and bronze. He also works in other media, creating series of prints and drawings. This macabre drawing is created from representational and abstract forms, which combine to create the impression of severance, death and destruction.",
