Nicholas Hilliard first trained as a goldsmith and introduced to this watercolour art innovative techniques for painting gold and jewels.  In this miniature we see his characteristic curling and scrolling calligraphy, painted in real gold and then burnished.\n\nPlace\nNicholas Hilliard set up business in Gutter Lane in the City of London.  In his treatise on limning Hilliard noted that limners  should choose an area away from other trades, a 'place where neither dust, smoke,  noise nor stench may offend' and some colours would suffer in the 'sulphurous air of seacoal and the gilding of  goldsmiths'. Also 'the place where you work' should be lit from the north-east by one window, 'great and fair', with no walls or trees blocking the light.  The late Medieval buildings of London would have made it hard to find such a workplace.\n\nPeople\nThis sitter was once called Mistress Holland, Maid of Honour to Queen Elizabeth, because of a later inscription on the miniature's back.  There is no real proof that she is Mistress Holland, but her magnificent costume, embroidered with tiny bees and deer, does not rule against her being a lady of the court.",
