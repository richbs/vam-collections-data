            "physical_description": "The rectangular relief is divided into two horizontal registers, the top right hand corner having been broken off. The upper edge of the slab has a half-round moulding decorated with lotus petals. The two registers are separated by a rounded moulding carved with a motif of twisted strings of pearls and ribbons. The lower register is divided into two scenes from the life of the Buddha separated by three framed columns with rounded shafts with stylised Corinthian capitals. The shafts are marked with incised horizontal lines to indicted they are comprised of three blocks and stand on plain plinths and rounded circular bases. An incised zig-zag line under the left hand column may be a mason's mark.\n      The upper band is the shallower of the twoand comprises four figures (originally five) seated under <i>caitya</i> arches between stumpy columns carved with plain shafts which rise up to a bell-shaped block which supports a motif based on a double lotus pedestal under an Indo-Iranian style capital with saw-tooth decoration.  The <i>caitya </i>arches also have saw-tooth decoration and rest on stylised bunches of grapes.  The figures within these arches comprise two seated Buddhas in lotus position with their eyes downcast in meditation and their hands in their laps wrapped in their robes. The Buddha on the left is flanked by two worshippers seated each with one leg drawn up against their bodies which are twisted round in adoration of the Buddha with their hands raised together in the <i>anjali mudra</i>. The figure on the left has his hair drawn loosely back in tresses with a top-knot while the figure on the other side in the central position wears a cockaded turban  the right hand figure which is now lost was presumably of another worshipper facing the other Buddha).\n      The scene on the right of the lower register depicts 'The Great Departure', when Prince Siddhartha leaves his worldly royal life at Kapilavastu. The prince is seen riding his horse, Kanthaka, wearing his princely clothes and a cockaded turban. Behind him the figure of Chandaka holds up a royal parasol, while below the horse two heads and torsos of yakshas emerge from the ground to hold up the horse's hooves to deaden their noise. On the left Mara stands in a defiant pose holding a bow in his left hand and a club in his right. He, too, wears a cockaded turban. Behind him on the extreme left there is another figure with curled hair tied in a loose topknot and wearing jewellery.\n      The other scene on the left side of the slab shows the Buddha with a downcast expression wearing his monk's robes seated on a low box-like seat decorated with a zigzag pattern. He raises his right hand in the <i>ahhaya mudra</i> and clasps a bowl in his left hand in his lap. Two ladies approach him on the left, the front one carrying a spouted vessel and the other a deep bowl.  They wear heavy earrings with braided hair under twisted wreaths. Two turbaned male worshippers stand inclined towards the Buddha on the other side with their hands in the <i>anjali</i> position. The iiconography of this scene may reasonably be assumed to be the 'Gift of Amrapali', in which the courtesan, Amrapali, confirms her donation of a mango grove to the Buddha's religious Order through pouring some water.\n   On the upper and lower edges there are grooves for clamps.",
