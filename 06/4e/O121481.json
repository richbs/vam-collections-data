Japanese-born Mori first studied at Musashino Art University, Tokyo (1993-97), and has risen to almost instant fame since graduating from Camberwell College of Arts, London, in 2000. In 2004, Peter Jones, Sloane Square, commissioned her to create a foyer sculpture entitled 'Sprig' for its newly refurbished interior. \n\nMori says of her own work, 'I am always drawn to the visual impact of an aggregate assembled with many small components and find infinite possibilities of the form multiplied by the vital power beyond the physical space, such as cell division through the microscope. My work consists of multiples of individually forged silver or steel and the subtle difference of each piece results from hand-hammering. No piece is individually planned but becomes fully formed within the making and thinking process. The uncontrollable beauty is the core of my concept.'",
