The form was used particularly in Eastern Scotland and also in Salisbury, where a group of chairs has been identified, which may come from the same workshop. The French origin of the design may have suggested the name caqueteuse (a chattering woman or a gossip) which was used for such chairs in the early 20th century by British collectors.  Some French chairs of the period were known as caquetoires, but these were usually upholstered.\n\nThis famous chair was formerly in the collection of Percy Macquoid, who illustrated it in his influential book  The History of English Furniture, published in 1904. He described who it was found covered in layers of black paint in the village of Colyton, Devon in about 1860. Some obvious repairs indicate that the chair was restored in the 19th century, and probably taken apart completely at this time.  The chair was dated by its carved back panel but some experts have questioned whether this dates from the 16th century. They have argued that the hairstyle, the low-cut bodice and puffed, slashed sleeves suggest a 19th-century version of 16th-century costume, possibly intended to represent Mary, Queen of Scots.  It is possible that a 19th-century panel was inserted into an earlier chair frame, or that the chair was actually created as a fake in the 19th century.",

            "history_note": "Notes from National Trust Study day 2003 by NH\nOak armchair of 'caqueteuse' or 'caquetoire' form with carved back panel. Acquired as c1535, later revised to 1550-1600.\n\nRepairs\nPR arm - a new section let in at tip. PL arm - a new mid section let in.\nSeat front edge repaired at PR side.\nShaped seat reinforcers held with machine made screws (may be dated to after mid 19c)\nPL front leg -  new lower section has been spliced in and secured with what is probably a screw covered by a plug. (An x-ray would confirm this.)\nScrewed metal brackets under arms and on PL rear leg\n\nInteresting details\nSeat boards have unnecessary pegged holes. The seat might have been replaced using say old floorboards, or are the holes evidence of earlier repairs, now removed?\nThe carved panel is the most prominent part of the seat, but costume details are inconsistent and the full-face face carving (as opposed to profile) feels suspiciously 19c. Might the chair have been improved with a new panel? \nFrom the reverse of the carved panel you can see that it is rebated into the grooves of the frame, and the back smoothed down. On much oak furniture of the 17th century you would expect a relative lack of finish and 'bevelled' edges to the panel. Rebating is a feature of 16c panel construction and smooth finish is more in keeping with a  high quality chair (as this purports to be). Some irregularities in the smooth finish can be seen, but might be explained by the maker planing down a rough patch across the panel (known as traversing) before using the plane along the grain in the usual direction. We know that the chair was stripped of layers of dark paint in the 19c, which might also explain some surface marks. The knot has been cited as evidence of 16c date, as a 19c faker would take care to use better timber.\nThe front stretcher has a protruding moulding, in common with many chairs of this type, especially French examples, which also employ moulded arms. Do you think the wear is convincing?\nThe arms meet the back in a clasped tenon (aka bird's mouth), where the arm wraps around the edge of the back panel, and the back panel is angled. This method is found on French chairs, but not Scottish or Salisbury chairs, raising the question of whether this chair could be French.\nWoodworm channels are exposed at base of back panel, as well as simple exit holes. Exposed channels may be evidence of old timber being reused (since the surface has been planed down) especially when they occur on a moulded surface but any pressure on worm-infested wood can cause the thin layer of wood covering the channel to collapse revealing the channels. On the other hand it has been suggested that exposed channels in this position (under a cushion, where natural wear would occur) are not so unusual.\nInitials IS scratched on reverse of top rail. Scratched initials like this are unlikely to have been a maker's mark, which were more often punched. It  probably relates to an owner, though of course not necessarily the first owner.",
