When the handle is turned the images flick over and, seen in rapid succession, give the impression of a moving picture. This is the effect of the phenomenon known as 'persistence of vision', whereby the eye briefly retains the memory of an image. Kinora reels have about 600 pictures and turning at a speed of about 10 pictures per second, they last about a minute. The Kinora was one of the domestic versions of the mutascope a paying device usually found in amusement arcades and on seaside piers at the beginning of the twentieth century. These are sometimes known as 'What the Butler Saw' machines.",
