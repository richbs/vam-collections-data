Here a nobleman is visiting a lady at her home. Outside two women are drawing a floor design (rangoli) in rice paste, and a couple are playing a board game called pachisi or chaupar. The festival of Diwali falls during Karttik, and it is traditional to play games, and often make a bet, at this time. \nThe style of the painting is typical of Bikaner in Rajasthan in the early 18th century, and appears to be the work of the court artist Murad.",
