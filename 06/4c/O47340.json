The nose is vertically stitched in black wool with the central five stitches dropped to meet the mouth which is an inverted V shape. The ears are small and placed on the side of the head with the upper edges aligned with the head seams. The eyes are black boot buttons. The stuffing in the head is wood wool and that of the body and limbs is a mixture of wood wool and kapok. There appears to be some sort of voicebox in the lower body. There is a blank metal button in the left ear.",
