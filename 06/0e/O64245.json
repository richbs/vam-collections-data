The head, right arm, portions of feet and hands are missing.  He is wearing monk's robes with his right shoulder bare. One end of the robe hangs over his left shoulder, and the other end is lightly held over palm. The icon refers to the moment of the final defeat by the Buddha of the demon Mara and the forces of worldly entanglement.  With this gesture the Buddha called upon the earth goddess to witness his victory over temptation.  She appeared and his final victory was confirmed. A <i>vajra</i> (thunderbolt), rests on the lotus seat  between his knees, symbolising the adamantine quality of his faith.",
