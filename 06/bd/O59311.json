The wide blade at the front collected the crumbs, which were held by the low curved rim at the back. As an alternative, families without a crumb scoop might sweep away crumbs with a napkin or a crumber ( a small tray with a brush).\n\nDesign & Designing\nCrumb scoops or gatherers could be very plain or elaborately decorative, with heavily engraved blades and fluted ivory or stag horn handles.\n\nThe Electroplate Process\nThis crumb scoop was made by the electroplating method. The manufacturing firm of Elkington & Co., founded in Birmingham by George Richard Elkington (1801-1865) and his cousin Henry Elkington (about 1810-1852), exploited the development of the new manufacturing process of electroplating, in which silver is deposited on a base metal by the action of an electric current. Elkingtons revolutionised the silver and plating trades throughout the world by marketing electroplate as a cheaper substitute for silver. People of limited means were therefore able to decorate their tables with items that had the look of silver, and thus conveyed wealth and status, but  at a much more affordable price. In 1896 the Goldsmiths' and Silversmiths' Company offered solid silver crumb scoops for \u00a32 15s (\u00a32.75), over twice the price of an electroplated example at \u00a31 5s (\u00a31.25).",
