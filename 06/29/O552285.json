The range of hi-tech tubular metal furniture, painted in bright 1970s colours, represented a complete departure from the traditional cosiness of British furnishings. The industrial look of the seating and tables fitted into the new mid-1970s fashion for converting industrial premises and warehouses into living spaces, where the old boundaries between the domestic and work space were being blurred. Like much of Conran's furniture, this range was intended equally for domestic or business use.",
