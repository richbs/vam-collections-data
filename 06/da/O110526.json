Born in India on 4 November 1862, he was educated in Plymouth, Devon, and set several of his novels in and around Dartmoor, including Children of the Mist (1898), The River (1902), The American Prisoner (1904), The Whirlwind (1907), The Mother (1908), The Virgin in Judgment (1908), The Three Brothers (1909), The Thief of Virtue (1910), The Flint Heart: a Fairy Story (1910), The Beacon (1911), The Forest on the Hill (1912) and Orphan Dinah (1920).  He was President of the Dartmoor Preservation Association and died on 29 December 1960.\n\nThe Flint Heart: a Fairy Story was reviewed by the New York Times Saturday Review on 15 October 1910: 'Mr Phillpotts has written a fairy-tale, and it is such a good fairy-tale that every one is sure to be very glad that he has done it'.  In December 1910 the same newspaper included the book in its list, 'One Hundred Holiday Books', with a final note, 'The sixteen excellent illustrations are by Charles Folkard'.\n\nCharles Folkard (1878-1963) was an artist, illustrator and author of children's books.  Educated at Lewisham, he became apprenticed to a firm of designers but left to become a professional conjuror. He later produced illustrations for The Daily Mail, inventing the cartoon character, 'Teddy Tail'.  The Flint Heart (1910) was one of Folkard's earliest commissions; he went on to illustrate children's books for the next forty years, including Swiss Family Robinson (1910), Pinnochio (1911), Grimm's Fairy Tales (1911), Aesop's Fables (1912), Arabian Nights (1913), Jackdaw of Rheims (1913), Mother Goose Nursery Rhymes (1919), British Fairy and Folk Tales (1920) and Songs from Alice in Wonderland (1921).",
