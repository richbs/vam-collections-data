Tompion numbered most of his clocks and a date sequence has been worked out by specialists using these numbers.  This number is consistent with a date of manufacture around 1690.\n\nThe movement has a gong train with a large spring, barrel fusee and pendulum.  It is also fitted with a complex repeating mechanism.  If the cords attached to two short arms at the back of the clock are pulled, the hour and quarter hour are struck on two bells of different pitch.  The case is of oak and a measure of the quality of Tompion's workmanship is the use of an ebony veneer of unusual thickness.\n\nMaker\nThomas Tompion (1639-1713) was the leading English clockmaker of the period.  He introduced some important innovations, including some of the first watches with balance springs and also complex repeating mechanisms for clocks.  All his clocks and watches are of outstanding quality.  A contemporary recorded that Tompion could get as much as \u00a310 for his clocks, whereas other clockmakers could only get \u00a34 to \u00a36.\n\nOwnership & Use\nThe owner of this clock was from the French family of Lefort des Ylouses and came from Boulogne.  A family story records that the clock was first acquired by a member who had been a French prisoner of war during the Napoleonic wars.  He was presumably a senior officer on parole, and thus wealthy enough to buy such a clock.",
