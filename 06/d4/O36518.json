Written on the top in pencil is Stasione Grande. \n2. box base; plain brown cardboard with staples at each corner. On one end is a white paper label printed in black to show the maker's name and trademark resembling a 19th century steam engine together with Made in Germany. Also on the label is stamped `1St 418'and hand written in pen the price 18,500 (DMs). Stamped on the end of the box above the label are 88 and U within a circle. \n3. station; pressed mild steel with celleloid strips used to cover the windows. The base is rectangular painted a soft olive green over a base\nochre colour. It has two holes in the body and one hoop cut out of one side. The underside has a black ink stamp - M\u00c4RLIN; in an oval with Made In Germany underneath. (Attached by cellotape to the underside is a small label number 12 which may indicate that the station was originally part of a private collection.)\nThe body of the station is painted ochre and is marked with a series of doors and windows; most of which have been cut out. On one long side, all the windows have been cut out and the lower ones trimmed with a creamy yellow paint. There are also four doors, painted dark brown and with the top halves cut out. The other long side has a partial balcony, panels of windows both top and bottom which are covered with panels of opaque celluloid and two brown doors which open and are held in place by small swivel hooks. Most of the windows are trimmed with the creamy yellow paintwork and two blocks are marked, one Wirtschaft and the other Gep\u00e4ck, on white metal strips attached to the wall. Also on this side is a red pillar box and a red post box, two more dark brown doors\nwhich do not open and two green pumps and a bar across the top. The balcony fits round one of the narrow ends of the station. This end is divided and into the centre is placed with clock tower, held by a bracket painted both green and ochre. The other narrow end has panels of windows which have not been cut out. Inside the body is a bracket from which hangs an electric light bulb and electric wires which end in red and green plugs. \n4. roof; pressed mild steel; slightly shaped and painted brick red with the corners tinged with green. One end is cut away to fit around the clock tower. \n5. clock tower; pressed mild steel; painted ochre with one side showing a round clock, two dark brown doors and set of small windows. The clock is marked in black, the arms showing 9 o'clock and backed with a sheet of opaque celluloid. \n6. clock tower roof; painted brick red with a patch of dark green. At one end is a `radio mast'. \n7. electric light bracket \n8. label marked 12; which was originally cellotaped to the under side of the station.",
