The house was built between 1722 and 1735, and the State Apartment -- comprising a bedroom, dressing room and drawing room -- was furnished by about 1732.\n\nThe centrepiece of this suite -- all covered in the same rich green silk velvet -- is the great State Bed designed by William Kent (V&A Museum no. W.58-2002). Kent does not appear to have designed the accompanying seat furniture, which was probably entirely the responsibility of the chair maker. This may have been Thomas Roberts junior, who supplied other furniture to Walpole around this time. These pieces are carved naturalistically with with lion's masks and legs, and gilded on a ground made gritty with sand.\n\nOn loan to Houghton Hall.",
