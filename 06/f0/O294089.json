In 1935 his son Charles Goldsmith entered the firm with the aim of making glasses a fashion item. From the company's offices in Poland Street, his sons A. Oliver and Ray Goldsmith built upon the company's reputation for attention-grabbing designs and solicited celebrity endorsement for their products. Key clients included Lord Snowdon, Princess Grace of Monaco and Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\nCharles Oliver Goldsmith designed this frame at a time when the plastic was cut and shaped by hand in the company workshop. The frame received much publicity at the time. Its unusual design, with the sides of the frame emerging from the nose, was photographed being worn by celebrity actress Diana Dors on July 15, 1956.",
