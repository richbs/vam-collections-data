As the name suggests, diners used it spread butter. Examples with a silver blade were made from about the 1770s onwards.  \n\nToday, \u2018cutlery\u2019 refers to knives, forks and spoons in general. Historically, cutlers made only the knife-blade (of steel). Knife-handles, spoons and forks, together with servers and other table implements made by silversmiths are known as \u2018flatware\u2019. Francis Higgins, who made this butter knife, specialised in spoons and forks. \n\nThe main technique for decorating flatware was die-stamping. The silver \u2018blanks\u2019 were pressed between two steel dies or moulds previously carved with the imprint of the design. The dies were expensive to produce and intended for mass-production.",
