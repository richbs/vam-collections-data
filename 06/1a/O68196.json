On the right hand side of the 'h' is a portrait of a woman (Mala Sinha). Between the 'k' and 'h' on a much smaller scale, there  is a full figure image of Mala Sinha in a dance costume. On the left hand side of the 'k' and extending to the bottom of the cover is a large scale portrait of a man (Dharmendra).  The cover is coloured in blocks of bright pink, yellow and black and has a very sixties look to it.\n\nOn the inside cover is an image of a couple , she is holding a Chinese umbrella. Above them is written 'The great adventure of a brave brand of Indian patriots'.\n\nThe first page has portraits of Mala Sinha and Dharmendra in one half along with a synopsis of the film in English. The next four pages have a synopsis and song lyrics in Hindi interspersed with images and the final three pages have the equivalent in Urdu.
