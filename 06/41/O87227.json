Fans were part of the exhibition, both as items of display and as souvenirs of the event.  This fan was probably one of the more expensive souvenir versions. It has bone sticks rather than the less expensive wood ones.  The reverse of the fan leaf is printed in gilt with vignettes of female silhouettes alternating with coats-of-arms.\n\nThe proceeds of the Great Exhibition allowed the purchase of land for the South Kensington Museum, now the Victoria & Albert Museum.  The V&A acquired many of the Great Exhibition\u2019s winning entries. They now form an integral part of the its collections.",
