Unusually, the saint is shown without wings, but these were probably lost when the top of the panel was cut away. In his left hand he holds a shield, which he also thrusts into the dragon's jaws. The saint's body, arms and legs are carved with scored, overlapping squares representing feathers to indicate he is an angel. He wears a kerchief round his neck and a cloak draped from his left shoulder. The dragon's tail curls round the saint's left leg.\n\nThe lower part of the panel, including the saint's feet and most of the dragon, is missing. The saint's right hand and the top part of the lance are missing. His head has been broken from the body and replaced. The panel has been roughly cut away round the head and shoulders of the saint. No paint remains.\n\nThe back of the panel is marked with a roughly drawn profile of a man, a number of random scratches, the number '15541' and an outline shield with some deep cuts in it. There is one lead-plugged hole.",

Unusually the saint is shown without wings, but these were probably lost when the top of the panel was cut away. The saint's body, arms and legs are carved with scored, overlapping squares representing feathers to indicate he is an angel.",

A panel, closely resembling the present panel in design, of St. Michael (with wings) was in the chapel of Naworth Castle, Cumbria. A carving of the saint is on the side of the alabaster tomb of William Rudhall (d. 1530) and his wife at Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire.",
