Ravanat Naik's identity is unknown, but he was probably working with them as a draughtsman on the   Pamban Passage clearance; he may have been a Naik / Naigue, a rank equivalent to Corporal in the Madras Sappers, under Jenkins' command.  Jenkins was supervising the Pamban Passage project, clearing a new shipping channel between the coast of Madras and Sri Lanka. Their headquarters was only a few miles across the same island from Rameshwaram, and a short boat trip up river from the Madras coast to the other sites at Madurai.\n\nAlong with seven other watercolours by the same team, and five by Justinian Gantz, it was presented to the Court of the Honourable East India Company on 16th January 1845 by a Captain Lock. The paintings were in the India Museum until five were transferred to the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1878.\n\nSince the beginning of the nineteenth century, English soldiers and civil servants had been collecting information and images of the historic sites in India. In 1800-5, Colonel Mackenzie had drawings of the temple, and the 'choultry' of Tirumala Nayak at Madurai made for him by  an Indian draughtsman. The present drawings are significant in illustrating the process by which Indian artists were recruited to help with military projects and archeological records. They also demonstrate the draughtsmanship which was an essential skill for military men, especially ones engaged in engineering projects.",
