London: The Victoria and Albert Museum in association with Hurtwood Press, 1983.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n\"<i>Paul Martin   British   1864-1942\nA group of snapshots   1890s\nCarbon prints in different colours (reproduced same size)   Given by Mr E. V. Martin</i>\n\nAmateur photographer liked the carbon process for the degree of control over the final image it afforded as the carbon tissue could be transferred to any paper, or indeed, other surface.  Carbon prints on rough papers, especially suited to the impressionistic photography of the 1890s, were popular for exhibition work.  Just over a third of the prints exhibited at the Royal Photographic Society in the 1890s were made by the carbon process.  The prints could be made in a very wide range of colours.  The Autotype Company offered some 30-odd different colour-ways including Campari pink.  Purists preferred the sobriety of grey and sepia, but some photographers, like Paul Martin, experimented with a range of colours which reinforced the general atmosphere of their subject matter.  Carbon printing was done by contact; small negatives give small prints.  To make large prints, large original or enlarged duplicate negatives had to be made.\nPaul Martin habitually recorded his holidays in the 1890s, usually preserving the results in small albums.  He printed mostly in platinum but also used carbon.  The snapshots (the word Martin himself used) here were taken on holidays in Hastings (1893), Jersey (1896) and elsewhere.  The albums show that he worked methodically with the same ingredients, here notably sea, beach and sky and their fluctuating light relations.\"",
