Valpy and his wife in a late 17th-century house in the Cathedral close at Winchester. The dining room is an early example of the taste for 'decorating with antiques' which is still current today. Eighteenth-century style furniture is mixed with more contemporary design, such as the easy chairs under fabric covers, all set on a splendid highly coloured rug.\n\nVery little is known about the artist, except that she lived in Winchester when these watercolours were painted and normally specialised in architectural subjects.",
