Lead-glazed ceramic production here began probably in the 17th century and carried on into the 19th century. More recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in traditional lead-glazed incised slipware in the region and new potteries have emerged.\n\nDishes, or bowls, of a similar size and decoration are found in collections in Switzerland and in Germany. From about 1725 to 1760, the central imagery is primarily floral. After this and until the early years of the 19th century, the central imagery consists of fish, birds and human forms. They exhibit a variety of inscriptions which, although, specific to the person who commissioned the bowl, are not related to the imagery depicted. It has been assumed in the past that if the bowl had, for example, a central image of a fish, it was meant to be used as a dish for cooked fish, and other such image/function connections.  It is now believed that these dishes were used for a variety of food items. The fine decoration suggests that they were used on special occasions rather than for daily use.\n\nThe similarities between this dish and one now in the Historisches Museum in Bern are striking. The wide border design of alternating rosettes, 'pomegranates' and leaf forms is the same and the construction of the letters in the inscription is very similiar. The dish in Bern bears the initials 'S.C.' and it is very likely that S.C. is also responsible for the V&A dish.",

Emile Calame (5 rue du Grand-Chene, Lausanne).\nThe similarities between this dish and the one in Bern (see Wyss in References) are striking. The wide border design of alternating floral and leaf forms is the same. The construction of the letters is almost precise. The dish in Bern bears the initials 'S.C.' and it is very likely that S.C. is also responsible for the V&A dish.\n\nDishes, or bowls, of a similar size and decoration are found in collections in Switzerland and in Germany. From about 1725 to 1760, the central imagery is primarily floral. After this and until the early years of the 19th century, the central imagery consists of fish, birds and human forms. They exhibit a variety of inscriptions which, although, specific to the person who commissioned the bowl, are not related to the imagery depicted. It has been assumed in the past that if the bowl had, for example, a central image of a fish, it was meant to be used as a dish for cooked fish, and other such image/function connections.  It is now believed that these dishes were used for a variety of food items. The fine decoration suggests that they were used on special occasions rather than for daily use.",
