It shows the goddess of Wisdom, Minerva amidst clouds, surrounded by allegorical figures representing Astronomy, Music, Poetry, Architecture, Sculpture and Painting.

This kind of work is commonly known as <i>modello</i>, i.e. a reduced-scale detailed preparatory drawing or painting that shows how the final composition would look like. \nThis work shows the mythological figure of Minerva, the goddess of Wisdom, surrounded by allegorical figures representing Astronomy, Music, Poetry, Architecture, Sculpture and Painting. In the final version (still <i>in situ</i>), Sculpture is holding a bust of William III crowned with laurel. The subject symbolised the King's enlightened patronage of the Arts.\nThe asymmetrical composition and the lively gesture of the figures, a few overlapping the edges of the painted oval frame, are typical of Verrio's manner. He specialised in providing his designs with a theatrical grandeur that helped to establish the vogue for Baroque decoration in England. The palette dominated by strong hues of red and reddish brown enlightened by touches of pure white and intense blue are reminiscent of the art of Rubens (1577-1640) and Van Dyck (1599-1641), still en vogue in England when Verrio came to London in 1671. His figures are often of beautiful quality, influenced by Neapolitan and French painting, which he knew before even travelling there thanks to Giovanni Andrea Coppola (1597-1659) with whom he collaborated in Lecce. \nThe complex composition, which recalls the earlier <i> Gods Assembled on Mount Olympus,</i> c. 1793, Museum and Art Gallery, Northampton, is reminiscent of  the great 18th-century Venetian decorative scheme, another evidence of the artist's extensive visual culture. Upon the death of the King in 1702, Verrio painted for Queen Anne his last royal commission in the Queen's Drawing Room.",

            "historical_context_note": "History painting, i.e. depictions of non recurring events based on religious, classical, literary or allegorical sources, particularly developed in Italy during the Renaissance (15th-16th centuries). History painting could include religious themes, or depictions of momentous recent events, but the term was most frequently associated with Classical subject-matter. However a renewed impetus was given to religious subjects after the Council of Trent (1545-63), which stipulated new iconographical programmes. The development of art treatises, in which the compositional rules guiding the art of painting were discussed also notably, influenced the evolution of history painting. From around 1600 history painting's principal rivals: still-life, landscape and genre painting began to emerge as independent collectable genres. Furthermore, the Rococo taste for the ornamental in the early 18th century prioritised the decorative quality of history painting, so that subject matters became more entertaining than exemplary. There was a renewed interest in history painting during the Neo-Classical period after which the taste for such pictures faded towards the end of the 19th century when an innovative approach to the image was led by the Symbolists and was developed further by subsequent schools in the early 20th century.",
