Since it came to the museum from Marie Ney herself it is reasonable to suppose that it was made for her as a souvenir and was not generally available.  Similar tankards were probably specially commissioned by the producer for all the cast members as a memento of the success of the production at London's Drury Lane Theatre, where it opened in March 1930. \n\nMarie Ney (1895-1981) was born in London but made her first professional stage appearance in Australia in 1916 and in Britain in 1923 at Brixton Theatre.  In 1924 she was engaged at the Old Vic for a season of plays, playing several Shakespearean heroines including Desdemona, Ophelia and Viola.  She became one of Britain's best-known leading ladies and played a wide variety of roles on stage and in films up until the 1960s.",
