The use of such a cup and cover in the home was purely decorative.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe design of this two-handled cup and cover demonstrates a typical feature of English Neo-classical silver, contrasting areas of plain, reflective surface with rich chased decoration. The acanthus leaves, swags, frieze and fluted ornament have been assembled to create a sophisticated object of high-quality craftsmanship.\n\nVase Mania\nThe vase was arguably the most fashionable interior design accessory of the late 18th century, and a distinctive icon of the Neo-classical style. Inspired by the revival of interest in the ancient world, the vase was often based on engraved design sources of a later period. This silver cup and cover in vase form was at the top end of the market for such products, along with the ancient urns imported from Italy and the ormolu-mounted (gilded) hard-stone vases.\n\nPeople\nLouisa Courtauld (died 1807) was a member by marriage of one of the most famous families of 18th-century goldsmiths. Her portrait, attributed to the society painter Johann Zoffany (1733-1810), but perhaps by Nathaniel Dance (1735-1811), shows a wealthy businesswoman, rather than a working silversmith. Louisa Courtauld ran the firm after the death of her husband, Samuel (1720-1765), at first alone, but from 1768 to 1777 in partnership with the senior apprentice, George Cowles. Later she formed a short-lived partnership with her son Samuel. Women were active in 18th-century London's business life. It has been estimated that one third of all women of property ran a business.",
