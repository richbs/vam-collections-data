J,3.41) the pigs can be  identified accordingly:\n\n\"Among pigs who have already reached the sea is Howick, on his back on a billowing wave; beside him floats a paper: 'Repeal of the Test Act'. Behind him the head of Lord Holland looks up wistfully. Lord Grenville is carried downwards, one forefoot on a paper: 'Emancipation of the Catholic Army and Navy', while the (torn) 'Catholic Bill' floats before him. His body is covered with a distended skin of guineas, in reference to his two highly paid offices. Next, the hind-legs and vast rump of Lord Temple project from the water; beside him is a paper: 'Last Stake of the Broad Bottom Family'. Beside him is an almost submerged barrel of 'Whitbread's Entire', from which project the hind-legs of the drowning Whitbread. Next behind these, and about to plunge into the waves, are Lord St. Vincent, wearing a naval coat, Buckingham in spectacles and Garter ribbon, Bedford (Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland), from whose neck falls a ribbon inscribed 'Erin-Go-Bragh'. Just behind St. Vincent and Buckingham are Windham, Fitzpatrick (on his back), and Petty; next above these: the Duke of Norfolk, Erskine wearing his Chancellor's wig, Lauderdale, his body covered with tartan, and Spencer, with Moira close behind Bedford. The latest pigs to leave the ground are Ellenborough in his wig, Courtenay, Sidmouth, Derby, Carlisle, and Tierney; a little apart from the others Sheridan, his body covered with Harlequin's chequered coat, still has his hind-legs on the edge of the cliff. Portions of six other pigs appear in the m\u00e9l\u00e9e.\"\n\n(British Museum database)",
