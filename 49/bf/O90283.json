It was recovered from the site of Endere, a fort site that had been occupied during the fifth century AD, abandoned, and then reoccupied by the Chinese from the eighth to the eleventh century AD. All the textile pieces from this site in the V&A are from the early occupation era, some from the fort and some from the house settlements. They are mostly felts, plain weave wools and silks and some possible hemp threads.   \n\nEndere is part of an area of Central Asia we now call the Silk Road. The term refers to a series of overland trade routes that crossed Asia, from China to Europe, where the most notable item traded was silk.  The Silk Road was also important for the exchange of ideas. Whilst silk textiles travelled west from China, Buddhism entered China from India in this way.\n\nThe Victoria and Albert Museum has around 700 ancient and medieval textiles recovered by Stein at the beginning of the twentieth century. The textiles range in date from the second century BC to the twelfth century AD. Some are silk while others are made from the wool of a variety of different animals. Most of the pieces are fragmentary and it is not easy to see what they would originally have been used for. Occasionally, whole items survive such as shoes, purses and religious banners.",

During the Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD), Endere fell to the Tibetans and the city was abandoned in the ninth century AD, when the nearby Endere River changed its course. Stein excavated there in 1901 and 1906, locating remains of its great fort and a number of buildings devoted to Buddhist worship. In one shrine he found textile rags and fragments of Buddhist manuscripts deposited at the feet of stucco statuary, possibly as votive offerings. Written in Chinese, Tibetan and Sanskrit and other scripts, they suggested that the shrine had drawn worshippers from far and wide. The V&A holds, on loan, a number of textiles from Endere, including tanned leather, wool felts and yarns, woven silk, and braided plant fibres.",
