She has a wax over composition head, with painted and moulded features, inset black glass eyes, and dark hair falling in ringlets from a centre parting.  The body is of undyed calico; the main seams are at the centre back and the inside legs and crotch.  The hands (each of which had originally three separate fingers but no thumb) and the forearms are of tan leather, giving the appearance of gloves, and the upper arms are of calico.  The clothing consists of \n\nA broad-brimmed hat of black beaver, the high tapering crown trimmed with an external band of black velvet around the base.  The band is finished with a bow of matching fabric at the centre back and trimmed with black beads and brown braid.  The hat has no fastenings, but is loosely stitched to the cap beneath.\n\nA cap of white spotted net, padded out with tissue at the back .  It is trimmed with a double ruffle of gathered lace which is decorated at each side of the face with a central row of looped white silk ribbon with picot edging. The cap is trimmed around the neck with more lace and ribbon, and fastens beneath the chin with tying strings of white ribbon to match that on the lace frills.\n\nA gown (betgwn) of unlined red wool patterned in a dark blue check.  It has three-quarter length sleeves and an open fronted skirt attached to the crossover bodice in unpressed pleats at the waist.  The garment fastens with a unattached tie belt of red woollen braid, and all edges have a binding to match. \n\nA matching ankle-length underskirt (pais) arranged in unpressed pleats at the waist and bound with red woollen braid.  The garment is fastened with a pin at the waist back.\n\nA plain cream cotton fichu.\n\nA shawl of printed cotton, printed in a red, black and cream paisley pattern with botehs and stylized flowers.\n\nAn apron of black and white checked wool attached in unpressed pleats to a waistband and tying strings of white cotton tape that fasten in a bow at the front\n\nA pocket of undyed chamois leather\n\nA pair of knitted black cotton undersleeves.\n\nA petticoat of striped dark blue and cream coloured wool, with unpressed pleats at the waist.\n\nA short petticoat or chemise of unbleached cotton\n\nA pair of short brown knitted cotton stockings.\n\nA pair of black leather shoes, hand stitched, with flat unit soles; the tops are bound with black ribbon.  Each of the vamps is trimmed with a black ribbon bow and a white glass button, and the ankle strap of each shoe also fastens with a white glass button.\n\n(original 1929 register entry):\nDoll, dressed: Welshwoman.\nThe doll is dressed in a red and blue check dress, a black and white check apron, paisley shawl, leather shoes and a high beaver hat with a twisted cord.",
