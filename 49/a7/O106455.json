A king with three attendants on foot, rides from the left towards a low building in which, lying on a bed, is another king, who raises himself up as if to greet his visitor. Behind him are three more attendants.\nThe scenes on the relief are explained with reference to three Kings, where David, on his deathbed, is urged to select Solomon as his successor as king of Israel. The bearded and crowned David is shown in his bed in an open building on the right, gesturing as if to introduce the next scene, with Sadoc, Nathan and Banaias in attendance. The same three figures are clearly shown on the left, accompanying the young, beardless but crowned Solomon, who is riding David's mule. The back is entirely plain.",

Stylistically this plaque is related to works of art produced in the Lower Rhine area at that time.\nThe scenes on the relief are explained with reference to three Kings, where David, on his deathbed, is urged to select Solomon as his successor as king of Israel. The bearded and crowned David is shown in his bed in an open building on the right, gesturing as if to introduce the next scene, with Sadoc, Nathan and Banaias in attendance. The same three figures are clearly shown on the left, accompanying the young, beardless but crowned Solomon, who is riding David's mule.\nThe relief probably formed part of the decoration of a stool, a 'faldistorium', a folding stool or throne.",
