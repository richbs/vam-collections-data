Woodblock printing is the technique used here, although this fabric is probably not from the top end of the market. It might have been used for curtains or upholstery. Several other designs for furnishing fabrics illustrating Nelson's naval victories are known, so the theme was obviously thought an acceptable one for a domestic interior.\n\nPeople\nViscount Nelson was born Horatio Nelson, a clergyman's son, in Norfolk in 1758, and was killed at sea off Cape Trafalgar, Spain, in 1805, a celebrated hero whose death was deeply and publicly mourned. As British naval commander in the wars with Revolutionary and Napoleonic France, he won crucial victories in major sea battles that included  the Nile (1798) and Trafalgar (1805), where he was hit by enemy fire while directing the conflict from his flagship, HMS Victory.\n\nSubject Depicted\nThe inscription depicted on the plinth on which the figure of Nelson stands - 'England expects that every man will do his duty' - refers to his famous last instructions, signalled in flags, to his battle fleet on the morning of the battle of Trafalgar.",
