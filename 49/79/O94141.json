            "public_access_description": "Caleb Wing was a specialist in the reproduction of medieval illuminations. John Jarman (died 1864) was one of the collectors for whom he worked. This facsimile was made from the Della Rovere Missal, which was illuminated in Italy in the 1490s by Francesco Bettini. It was probably made while Wing was repairing the original, which had been damaged by a flood. At that time John Jarman owned the Missal.\n\nWing was also a teacher. We know that he gave lessons in 'Missal Painting and Flower Painting from Nature' to young women in Brighton during the holiday season in 1859. Illumination was considered to be a genteel pastime. It was a drawing-room pursuit for women of good family. It was claimed to be more rewarding than embroidery or crochet-work.",
