Street clothes were held out by the '50s equivalent of crinolines - petticoats with channels containing plastic hoops or paper nylon or starched underskirts. However, couture clothes such as this extravagant, strapless evening dress had their own specially built petticoats.\n\nIn this playful Lanvin-Castillo design attention is focused on the back which forms an almost bustle-like protrusion. The petticoat falls straight at the front but behind has many layers of net and stiffening. The dress fastens over this and the top layer of net with large felt spots is curved up at the back to reveal the innumerable frills beneath. A double satin ribbon forms a sash and its plaited end with bow nestles in the black frills.\n\nWorn and given by Stella, Lady Ednam.\nThe Cecil Beaton Collection\nT.52&A-1974"

Castillo was known for his evening gowns with tightly fitting bodices perched above spreading skirts.  It reverted to the original name of Lanvin when Castillo left in the early 1960s to establish his own house.\n\n\"Other old established houses were rejuvenated by taking on new chief designers, such as Lanvin, which unusually was renamed Lanvin Castillo following the appointment of Antonio Canovas del Castillo in 1950.  This very grand, luxurious establishment, arranged over six floors, had 600 employees and a mainly private clientele, and was described by <i>Time</i> magazine as the place where Parisiennes would go 'if they wanted to be sure they would not be mistaken for Americans'.\u201d From Wilcox, C., 'Dior's Golden Age' in Wilcox, C., ed., <i>The Golden Age of Couture: Paris and London 1947-57</i> (V&A Publications, London), p.46",
