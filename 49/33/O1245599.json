Acting as the official photographer for the British Black Panther Movement, Kenlock\u2019s photographs record the group\u2019s activism and the instances of racism they aimed to combat. \n\nThis photograph depicts Desmond\u2019s Hip City, the first black-owned record shop in Brixton and a thriving cultural centre for music within Britain\u2019s black community. Kenlock documented the damage to the shop as an example of the racially motivated violence carried out by members of the right-wing group the National Front.\n\nThe V&amp;A acquired ten photographs by Kenlock alongside work by his contemporaries Charlie Phillips and Armet Francis as part of the Staying Power project. Staying Power is a five year partnership between the V&amp;A and Black Cultural Archives. The project aims to explore black British experience from the 1950s to the 1990s through photographs acquired by the V&amp;A and oral histories conducted by Black Cultural Archives.",
