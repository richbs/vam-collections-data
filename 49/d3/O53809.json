There are staples above the wrists and knees. There are strings to the wrists, and bar1 works the arms and legs together.  There is a run-through string from the top of the upper arm through the shoulder and side of the head to the second bar, and a string is attached to the top of the spine which runs through the head, through bar 2 and bar 3, and is then attached to bar 2.

Marionette shows were a popular form of entertainment for adults in the 19th century, many of them family concerns which travelled around the country long before the advent of film and television, presenting shortened versions of London's latest popular entertainment from melodramas and pantomimes to minstrel shows and music hall. In the 18th and early 19th centuries their theatres were relatively makeshift, but after about 1860 many became quite elaborate, with walls constructed from wooden shutters, seating made from tiered planks of wood, and canvas roofs.\n\nThe figures were carved, painted, dressed and performed by members of the company.  This is a trick figure of a dissecting skeleton which would have walked or danced on stage before magically dispersing its bones in the air and re-forming itself.  This was such a popular marionette music hall act that most marionette companies would have featured a similar figure in their troupe.",

They began working on recreating some of the puppets' original repertoire. Since the original cloths were too fragile for performance, new backdrops were painted, and in August 1951 as part of The Festival of Britain celebrations, the marionettes took to the stage again as The Old Time Marionettes, at the Riverside Theatre, Festival Gardens, Battersea Park. In the 1980s George Speaight lent the troupe to puppeteers  in Germany but in the late 1990s he sold them to John Phillips, whose widow sold them to The Theatre Museum after his death in 1998.",
