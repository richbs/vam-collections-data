An inscription is unusual in a commercially made garment at this date, but it shows the many different shapes and patterns that  the company's knitting machines could produce. The words may be adapted from the Bible: 'Be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren...' (1 Pet. 3:8).\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe stocking is knitted mainly in a lacy stitch that was popular in women's and children's stockings and socks during the 19th century. Stocking stitch, which is much stronger, was used for the sole of the foot and at the top, where the wearer would put most pressure on the stocking.\n\nInnovation\nAt this time Pope & Plante were trying out a knitting thread that mixed rubber with silk or cotton to give some flexibility.  This  produced better fitting stockings that would also last longer.",
