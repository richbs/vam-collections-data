In the centre is a lobed lozenge outlined with a band of red and white trefoils alternating with a small orange circular outline.  There is a red and blue 'sun' in the middle surrounded by 4 cypress trees and four small botehs.  The field is covered with tiny floral motifs and random stitches.  A fine red line forms a second lobed lozenge around the first. That space has tiny tree-like motifs on the green ground.  The four corners are triangular and filled with stitches: a cypress tree and 2 botehs and a quarter section of a series of concentric circles. \nThere is a wide border almost entirely covered with embroidery.  The recognisable designs include cypress trees and two types of very curved botehs.\nA narrow outer border is edged with the white and red dots and contains a black meander with red carnations, blue flower heads and a black outlined boteh with 2 red dots.  White stitches are used to outline the border and add detail.\nThe edges of the cover are unembroidered green twill.\nColours: Z2S; red, orange, blue, white, black, purple.\n\nFor a similar piece see 1062-1875.  Note: this is not identical to 874A-1877",
