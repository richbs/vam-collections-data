The album contains some of his work from the period 1706-1716, as well as five designs from the 1730s.\n\nJames Leman was born in 1688 into a weaving family of Huguenot descent. In 1702 he was apprenticed to his father, Peter, and lived with his family in Stewart Street, Spitalfields in London. Leman\u2019s inscription on the design states that it was made for his father Peter Leman, showing that he drew it while still an apprentice.",

The designs have been subsequently numbered by the Prints, Drawings and Paintings Department, however, a concordance exists.\n\nHistorical significance: The designs collected in the album are, with the exception of some fragmentary medieval examples in Italian collections, the earliest silk designs known to exist.",
