He did not specialise in collecting textiles although he owned some examples.  He was in contact with the Museum 1920s-1970 offering to sell objects from his collection.  Johnes did not provide the Museum with information about the history of ownership of the designs. \n\n*Mr B.W.

            "production_note": "The design comes from a group of designs that were part of a retailer's archive which employed professional embroiderers. The names of the female clients inscribed on the designs were of the aristocracy, gentry or from wealthy families that moved in the upper reaches of society.  They had homes in the country and came to London for the season.  Retailers who sold such designs were linen drapers and lacemakers, both of which categories existed in London and were available to the clients. Many pattern drawers worked in London where their trade proved a lucrative business during the season. The similarity of some of the designs from this group to those by Styart, whose designs were published in London, does support the argument that these designs came from a retailer's archive based in London.\n\nAttribution note: The design looks best in a vertical orientation.  The design might be for a petticoat or an apron without a border.  There is an apron in the Museum of London (MOL) which has sprigs all over it to the edge and which has only a narrow openwork border \nMOL. NN8175.  The way that the sprigs continue right to the edge is similar to this design which is why it could also be for an apron .   There is another apron, in the same Museum, that has sprigs which continue to the edge.  The border was made by gathering the muslin into a wide frill held by an embroidered seam MOL. Z.806.",
