The figure formed part of the decoration of the staircase, erected by Abbot Bonifazius Gessnet between 1754 and 1770, in the Abbey of Bildhausen, Unterfranken. Bildhausen, a Cistercian foundation, was secularised in 1803, and since 1914 has been in large part destroyed.\nIt has also been suggested that the present figure could represent a Sybil, probably the Libyan Sybil, who is normally shown with a garland of roses, and that there were more Sybils on the balustrade which have disappeared.\nDietz (1708-1777), was a German sculptor of the Rococo era. Ferdinand changed his name to Tietz. He was the second son of the sculptor Johann Adam Dietz.",
