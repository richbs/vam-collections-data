William Chappell trained as an artist, but became a dancer in the 1920s, combing a successful career as stage designer and dancer until he relinquished the performing stage for an even more successful career as a director, especially of revues;  he thus had an unrivalled understanding of what would work on stage for the dancer and of the simplicity demanded of working in a space as small as the Mercury Theatre.",
