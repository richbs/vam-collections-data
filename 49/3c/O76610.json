Julia Trevelyan Oman was famed for her meticulous research and attention to detail in her period costumes.  Many of the details would never be seen from the audience, but Oman believed that they would help the performers 'feel' the correct period and style.  \nThe dress is a recreation of the fashions of the 1920s, with high, Empire-line waist and straight skirt.  Costumes of this period were usually light-weight, but this dress is in satin, with wonderfully made rose trims.  These give the costume, and hence the wearer, weight and dignity suited to the fashionable society world depicted in Act III of the opera.   \nThe costume was made by the firm Bonn and Mackenzie, who were among the finest costume makers of their generation, famous for their attention to detail and creating believable 'clothes' for the performers.  Their costumes were a counter to anyone who thought that theatrical costumes were crude and tacky.",
