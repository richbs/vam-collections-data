Objects were selected to fit into the following themes, In the Home, Fashion, Exploration, Technology and Fantasy.  \n\nTin toys are some of the most sort after toys today.  They cover a huge range of movement mechanisms from friction and clockwork to battery.  They also cover a variety of subject matters.  One of the most prominent subjects is space and space travel.  As many of these toys were produced in the era of the Space Race, 1957 to 1972, the makers were inspired by the optimism of the time and the public demand for all things space related.  It also allowed them to create toys that are highly imaginative.  Most of these brightly coloured tin toys were manufactured in Japan.",
