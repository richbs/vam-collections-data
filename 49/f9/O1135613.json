            "public_access_description": "Because of the complex nature of Igor Stravinsky's score with its irregular rhythms Lydia Sokolova made notes on the choreography for her solo as the Chosen Virgin in Leonide Massine's production of Le Sacre du Printemps. This was the second staging of the ballet for Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes and Sokolova (who had also danced in Vaslav Nijinsky's production) considered Massine's ballet as more complicated and accurate than Nijinsky's.\n\nMassine began to choreograph the role of the Chosen Maiden on Sokolova in Liverpool where a pianola (mechanical piano) and piano rolls (perforated rolls which enable the pianola to 'play' the score) were hired. Stravinsky was an early supporter of mechanical recordings of his score. Massine's Le Sacre du Printemps was certainly one of the first ballets to be choreographed to a pianola.\n\nLydia Sokolova recorded in her autobiography Dancing for Diaghilev, p.159, the creation of the ballet. 'I had in my bag a little notebook of Hilda Bewicke's in which she had drawn for me the pattern of the dress she was making, as I wanted to copy it. Massine made me write down in this the number of times the first step was to be danced; then he tried the next, and I wrote that down....We tried several more movements, which I did not record at the time, but those first two steps remain in the small black notebook which I have always kept as a souvenir of the beginnings of the dance of the Chosen Virgin, perhaps the most extraordinary dance ever invented.' She later adds, 'The dance grew at terrific speed, and by the time the company arrived back in London three-quarters of it was done. It was all written down in the little penny notebook. That notebook holds the sole record of my dance in Le Sacre du printemps.' pp.160-161.\nMassine's production of Le Sacre du Printemps, re-using the score by Igor Stravinsky and sets and costumes by Nicolas Roerich, was first performed by the Ballet Russes on 15 December 1920 at Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Champs-Elys\u00e9es, Paris.",
