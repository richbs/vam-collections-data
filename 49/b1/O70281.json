Papers of this kind were popular in France, both with the aristocracy and with the ruling class who succeeded them in the years immediately after the Revolution that began in 1789. It is rare to find them in British houses, but this panel is part of a set of six in the V&A's collection from a house at Longford, near Newport, in Shropshire. The paper was printed at R\u00e9veillon's wallpaper workshop in the Rue de l'Arbre, Paris. R\u00e9veillon was one of the most important manufacturers and retailers of wallpaper in France in the later 18th century. Arabesque patterns derive from 16th-century engraved ornament and from Raphael's famous pilaster designs in the Vatican (about 1519), and ultimately from ancient Roman mural decoration.",
