With a large complex abstract pattern of ameboid shapes strongly outlined in black, enclosing discs of blue and green, and arranged in a regular grid pattern against subtly shaded areas of red and blue. Other areas enclosed have graduations of red to blue with variations caused by using weft threads of varied size. There are discs of blue on the same blue, and the discs are woven in a much thicker weft. In the bottom left hand corner is an area of yellow and green with a grid pattern of black dots.\n\nCotton warp of approximately 10 threads to the inch. Therefore there are approximately 960 warp threads. Woollen weft, varying from 10 to 14 weft threads to the inch, depending on the texture required by the pattern. \n\nThe artist's monogram 'HC' and the Dovecot mark are woven in green on the right about a third of the way down. The top two inches and the bottom two inches have been folded back and over sewn. At the top there is a canvas strip sewn on and press-studs fitted to it for display purposes.",

            "public_access_description": "Harold Cohen studied painting at the Slade School of Fine Arts in London. By the mid-1960s he had established himself as an abstract painter with an international reputation, representing Britain at the Venice and Paris Biennales. \n\nOver All was commissioned by the V&A in 1966; the Museum had previously acquired a large rug mural designed by Cohen for the British Government's Pavilion at the Milan Triennale of 1964. The merge of colours in the background is evocative of Cohen's early work but proved difficult to achieve on the loom. Cohen believed that weavers had to be involved in the design process from the earliest stage in order to understand and interpret the design and he developed a unique collaborative relationship with the Edinburgh Tapestry Company's weavers. Cohen understood that a woven textile can 'never look like paint ... for weaving is not a mere reproductive process'. This innovative approach produced one of the workshop's finest tapestries.\n\nA year or so after this tapestry was produced, Cohen took up a post as visiting professor at the University of California at San Diego, where he began to experiment with computers. Some of his earliest computer-assisted works from this period are also in the V&A's collections. In the 1970s, Cohen went on to develop AARON, a computer program that uses artificial intelligence to create machine drawings based upon the artist's accumulated knowledge and experience.",
