The back with low-relief, carved back panel with a coat of arms (unidentified) between two fluted pilasters, below a cornice and scrolling pediment carved with shell motif. The front and back legs joined with rectangular stretchers (no back stretcher). With a heavy grained (painted) oak finish.\n\nOf joined construction in oak with pegged mortise and tenon joints, with single-piece back uprights, and the front legs continuing as arm supports. Where the arms meet the back uprights, they are carved in a 'bird's mouth', but the fixing method is hidden beneath paint. The stretchers are not tenoned to the legs in the conventional manner, but carved and nailed to meet the rounded profile.\n\nModifications\nThe front feet tipped. The seat boards replaced, and with brackets beneath. Left arm clumsily built-up at joint with back upright. The eccentric and crude joint between the stretchers and legs suggests that the chair may have been considerably reduced in height and heavily rebuilt. The right arm has a round mortise on its underside, in an impossible position for an arm support given the shape of the seat, suggesting that it is a replacement.",

The coat of arms probably belong to the trade itself, but has not been identified. It is comparable to similar chairs belonging to the Incorporated trades of Aberdeen (at Trinity Hall, Holbourne St., Aberdeen) which date from the first half of the 17th century. The form of such chairs, with high, narrow back and curved arms is characteristic of eastern Scottish chairs that show mark French influence arising from 16th century trade links between the two countries. During the 19th century, they came to be called 'caqueteuse' chairs, from the French word for a gossip.\n\nThe chair has been reduced in height and substantially restored and heavily painted with a grained oak finish, possibly to conceal the repairs.",
