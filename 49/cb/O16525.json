Two hundred years later in England, Morgan specialised in genre scenes, usually with children, and here he shows a group of unruly boys just leaving school.  They have immediately engaged in a fight in the snow.  Morgan's subtle colouring, the tonalities of the winter landscape enlivened by the chromaticism of the boys' clothing, and the brisk handling of paint, have appealed to viewers since the picture was first exhibited, and it is not surprising that the image has been reproduced on several occasions in the form of a Christmas greetings card.\nPart of the Dixon bequest.",
