Pan consists of chopped areca nuts mixed with spices and wrapped in a leaf from the Piper betel tree. The small pouch would be offered after meals as a digestif, or as part of the leaving ceremonies at formal gatherings, particularly at court. The shape of this silver gilt  box is inspired by the shape of the leaves it held, and is extremely unusual.\n\nPlaces\nThe box was made at Alwar ('Ulwar' according to Victorian spelling) in Rajasthan and bears the maker's name, Lalji, about whom nothing is otherwise known.\n\nHistorical Associations\nThis box was exhibited at the 1851 Exhibition and was bought by the Museum of Ornamental Art for \u00a36.10s. Its relatively high price reflects the quality of the workmanship.",
