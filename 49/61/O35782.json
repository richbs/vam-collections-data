The whole is mounted on four wheels with the rear pair attached to rods to create the feeling of the pistons. At the front there is a coupling loop of brown cord with a matching hook at the back augmented with a wooden ball. The cab is designed with doorways and windows. \n\nDetails from John Gould: The flexible coupling was designed so that\nthe train could go on a track.\n[Train Carriage] carriage; beechwood with a black roof; the colour changes are achieved, as with the engine, by using ends and inner cuts of the wood. Mounted on 4 wheels which are secured with dowels rather than nails or pins. The coupling is the same as the engine's. \n\nDetails from John Gould: The flexible coupling was designed so that\nthe train could go on a track.",
