Long (1) picked up from Collins Baker (2) the names of Pole and Pooly; from Goulding the name of Mrs Pawling; and from <i>DNB</i> and Nagler the more plausible idea of William Peacke. Subsequently he inclined towards Plowman, on the grounds of a portrait of the Old Pretender as a boy, inscribed <i>Plowman W P</i>. (3) Oliver Millar produced the name of Powlet from a list of pictures at Old Somerset House: 'By William Powlet 302 A Lucretia leaning upon a Bed and stabbing herself, a limning from Kens. Sto: No. 42.' (4) Long's note on W P (5) cites two such subject miniatures, presumably both copies from pictures in the Royal Collection, a <i>Madonna Praying</i> and an <i>Old Woman</i>, the latter after a Rembrandt still at Windsor. Both are orthodox in technique, both about 115 x 90 mm, apparently similar in style and with monograms very similar to those on the following two miniatures. Recently Katherine Gibson has found the record of William Pawlett's appointment in 1673 as 'Lymner in Ordinary for drawing & Coppying of Pictures for his Mats. Cabinett' and as Gallery Keeper, 13 May 1686. (6) In 1701 he petitioned William III to have his salary of \u00a354.15s. per annum continued as a pension ('as he alledges no other subsistence for him selfe & family'), which William granted 14 January 1701 at Kensington Palace.

After its acquisition by the Crown in the early seventeenth century, 'Old' Somerset House, with its galleried central section attributed to Inigo Jones. served periodically up to 1774 as a royal dower house. It was demolished summarily in 1775 to make room for the new government and other offices designed by Sir William Chambers, known thereafter as Somerset House. \n5 Long 1923, p. 89. \n6 PRO, Lord Chamberlain's Papers, LC 3/27, p. 71. \n7 Katherine Gibson, personal communication, 1997 (citing, Lord Chamberlain's Papers, LC5/53, unpaginated) .\n\n<b>181</b> <b>Unknown Man </b>\n<b>1670-5 </b>\n612-1882\n\n<b>Rectangular 224 x 188 mm\n</b>\nFeatures freely hatched in brown and sanguine, with black in the eyes and facial hair and touches of white for the eyes and tip of the nose, on a pale creamy carnation ground; hair in brown wash, deeply hatched in gummy black and grey with ochre lights; cravat in impasted white over a grey wash; armour, landscape background and accoutrements in appropriate opaque washes, hatched with darker colour and heightened with white; sash in lake washed wet-in-wet; a black marginal strip; on vellum put down on a leaf from a table- book. \n\n<b>Condition:</b> Faded; some blackening of whites in the plume and armour; scattered flaking. \n\n<b>Signed:</b> Lower left, in white: <i>WP</i> (see A in Appendix 2). \n\n<b>Frame:</b> Tortoiseshell and black oak, perhaps late eighteenth- or early nineteenth-century.

A letter (1) to him from H M Hake at the National Portrait Gallery suggested instead Lord Clifford of Chudleigh (1630-1673), one of the Cabal, architect of the secret Treaty of Dover (1670) and Principal Secretary of State to Charles II (1672). \n\nThe date of this portrait, on the evidence of the wig, should be the early 1670s, at which date it would, to be James, have to compare with Lely's unfinished head of James in the NPG; (2) and to be Clifford it would have to compare with either of Lely's portraits of him from the late 1660s and early 1670s. (3) Neither of these sitters is convincingly similar - Clifford's face, in particular, being rounder, and the chin more prominent and dimpled. As Comptroller and Treasurer of the Household (finally, from November 1672, Lord High Treasurer), Clifford bore the white staff shown in the Lely cited. The sitter for this miniature distinctly bears a military baton. \n\nDoes the baton suggest the Earl Marshal? If so, the sitter could be Henry Howard (1628-1684), created Earl of Norwich and hereditary Earl Marshal of England in October 1672, and succeeding after his elder brother's death (13 December 1677) as 6th Duke of Norfolk. The likeness is just about compatible with Howard's in the whole length by Lely of 1677, (4) at which time Howard still had the appearance of a young man. \n\n1 30 July 1935; department files. \n2 NPG 1978-9, no. 41. \n3 See for example the seated portrait in undress, NPG 1978-9, no.42.\n4 Duke of Norfolk: NPG 1978-9, no. 53.\" \n",
