The woman is shown in half length, with her head turned upwards and to the right and her long waving hair bound by a jewelled fillet. She is shown wearing a loose ruched robe with a braided collar which has slipped from her right shoulder leaving her right breast bare. \n\nWhile previously identified as a Virtue, the figure's nudity, emotion and incomplete form set it apart from conventional representations suggesting instead an antique subject.  In particular the woman may represent Lucretia, a legendary figure whose rape and suicide triggered a revolution which led to the formation of the Roman Republic.",
