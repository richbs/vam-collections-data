In response, English harpsichord builders made larger instruments and fitted them with devices designed to vary the volume. But by about 1800 the piano had prevailed, largely thanks to the efforts of Broadwood himself. Broadwood had started his career making harpsichords in the workshop of Shudi's father, Burkat Shudi the elder (1702\u20131773). In 1770 he formed a partnership with his employer, making both types of instruments, which he continued with the younger Shudi from 1773 until 1793. After 1793 Broadwood traded alone, exclusively making pianos.",
