The Buddha is seated on a high cushion-covered platform with his right hand raised in <i>abhaya mudra</i>, while the other was missing on acquisition, but has been added at an unrecorded date as a restoration for display purposes in a raised position holding his robe. The face of the Buddha has a hint of a smile, his chin is dimpled, and his eyes have incised pupils. The head is set on a short neck and his hair is swept up to a small pointed <i>ushnisha.</i> His monk's robe covers both shoulders, the ends of which fall across his shoulders down to his knees. He has a plain circular nimbus behind his head over which  are splayed a canopy of leafy branches from the ashoka tree.  In front of the platform are four small crouching worshippers kneeling on their right knee with left foot flat on the ground.   On the upper level of the relief, the Buddha is surrounded by twelve worshippers, six on either side.   Among these worshippers, appearing as half figures, are two smaller torsos and heads with the one near the Buddha's right shoulder characterised as Vajrapani as he is holding a thunderbolt.\n\n The scene is carved under an imbricated half-round moulding, while the lower edge is carved with a foliate scroll.\n\nThe top right hand corner has broken off and the lower right hand corner is also damaged There are two  squared holes next to the Buddha's knees and another one above on the left under the top moulding which were presumably for architectural fixings. Other associated fragments with this relief are under IM 70, A and B-1939.",
