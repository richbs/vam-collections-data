Classically inspired 'sandal shoes', with their square toe and throat, flat soles, rosettes and ribbon ankle ties, continued to be worn in black or white for formal wear right up to the 1860s.  However, from the 1840s more elaborate styles for everyday wear began to emerge and heels came back into fashion.  \n\nBuckles, which were all but abandoned between 1790 and 1850, except on Court shoes, returned to popularity. These styles were sometimes referred to as Cromwells because they resembled a style of seventeenth-century footwear.  However, unlike their predecessors which served a practical function, the nineteenth-century buckle was purely for show.  Donated to the museum in 1919, this pair of shoes was worn by the donor in the 1870s.",
