The cloth is made up of three loom widths seamed together, each width being 35.5 cm across. Popular among commoners and royals alike, wrapping cloths (pojagi in Korean) were used to wrap gifts, to cover food, to wrap and store bedding quilts and for many other purposes. They were made in different sizes, patterns and materials, including cotton, silk, ramie and hemp. An item wrapped or covered in a beautiful pojagi signified its importance and showed respect towards the receiver. Special events, such as weddings, therefore necessitated new pojagi to be made. This was especially the case at the court when on royal birthdays, New Year\u2019s Day and other important occasions cloth was presented to each royal household for making clothes and shoes. At such times, the gifts were wrapped in different types of pojagi depending on the shapes and sizes of each item.",

Registered File number 1983/2216.\n\nIn the register a paper, written by Charlotte Horlyck, Curator of Korean Art at the Victoria & Albert Museum for The National Museum of Korea Newspaper states that:\n\u2018One of the most interesting textilic items in the collection is a square painted <i>pojagi</i> decorated with floral and auspicious symbols. Measuring 107 cm by 107 cm, the cloth is of natural-coloured plain-weave hemp and made up of three loom widths stitched together, each width being 35.5 cm. Surrounding the central roundel are twelve squares decorated with five different kinds of <i>kilsangmun</i> painted in the primary colours of red, blue and yellow, and secondary colours of pink, light blue and green. Painted <i>poljagi</i> like this one are usually called <i>tangch\u2019aebo</i>. They were produced at the court and seem to have been made specifically for royal wedding ceremonies. The motifs on the V&A\u2019s <i>poljagi</i> supports this as they all refer to long life, happiness, health and peace.\nAs is typical of <i>tangch\u2019aebo</i>, the most conspicuous motif is the central one of two phoenixes facing one another, this being a design, which also appears on wedding garments. The <i>kilsangmun</i> which surround the birds were popular auspicious motifs during the Chos\u00f4n period when they were used on a wide range of different artefacts, including lacquer and metalwares. The propitious message of the <i>poljagi</i> is further accentuated by the fruits and flowers, such as peony, pomegranates, peaches and <i>pul su</i>, which appear in the surrounding twenty squares. The peony, for example, has traditionally been a sign of abundance and prosperity, while the plentiful seeds of the pomegranate have made it a symbol of bountiful offspring. In the four corners are squares with grasses and <i>yongji</i>, symbolising longevity and immortality.\u2019",

Various materials were used, including silk, cotton, hemp, and ramie, but <i>chogakpo</i> are generally stitched together of the same kind of fabric, though different fineness of weaving is not uncommon. It is interesting that pieces of men\u2019s and women\u2019s clothes were never sewn together, which clearly reflects how men and women lived in separate quarters as prescribed by the strict Confucian rules of propriety which governed society at this time.\nThe earliest surviving <i>poljagi</i> dates to the late 11th century, thus testifying to a long and unbroken tradition of making and using these items in Korea. In the Chos\u00f4n period they developed into a highly expressive art form, culminating in works that have continued to fascinate and inspire people even today. A large number of exhibitions featuring <i>poljagi</i> have been held in Western museums, including the V&A, and their strong designs and bold colour combinations have made them among the most well known and popular Korean art objects in the West.\u2019\n\nFrom Kim, Soo Kyung, <u>A Study of Poljagi (Korean Wrapping Cloths) in the Late Chos\u00f4n Dynasty (1724-1910)</u>, unpublished PhD thesis, New York University, 1997, p.115:\n'Fourteen <i>inmunbo</i> [painted <i>poljagi</i> made for the court] are preseved in the Royal Museum (Seoul), a direct royal inheritance from the Chos\u00f4n dynasty (table 14). The Museum of Korean Embroidery (Seoul) has several more, and the researcher has confirmed that some are also preserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum (London) and Suk Joo-sun Memorial Museum of Folk Art in Tanguk University.'\n(This volume is in the FED library 4AJ30).",
