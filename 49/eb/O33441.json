The high vantage point offers a sweeping view over the enclosing cliffs and the mountains beyond. The characters in the red cartouches read, from left to right, 'Ashisokokuraya', 'yushuku', 'Sugawa', 'Hayakawa' and, once again, 'yushuku'. 'Yushuku' means 'hot spring inn'. Ashisokokuraya appears to be a place name. Hayakawa, or Haya River, is the name of the river downstream of the bridge. Sugawa is the name of its upper reaches. \n\nHakone is still one of the most popular resorts in Japan. It is situated in the south-western corner of Kanagawa Prefecture. From certain vantage points, it offers spectacular views of Mount Fuji some 40 kilometres away. Hakone was the 10th post-station along the Tokaido Highway. City dwellers wanting to escape the noise and bustle of Edo (modern Tokyo) could reach it relatively easily. Many of its inns were built around its hot springs. These were a popular subject for  'ukiyo-e' ('pictures of the floating world') artists. They made paintings and woodblocks aimed at the popular urban market.",
