There is a similar bust in lead said to depict Fairfax, which has led to the suggestion that the present piece represents the same sitter. Weaver supported the theory that the lead bust was indeed a portrait of Fairfax by noting that the lead bust located in the Council Chamber of York Philosophical Society is a replica of a bronze bust at Leeds Castle in Kent, a former home of the Fairfax family. He suggested that the Leeds bust was by the medallist and wax-modeller Abraham Simon (1617-1692), whose brother, the medallist Thomas Simon (1618-1665), also executed medals depicting Fairfax.",
