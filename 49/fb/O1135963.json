Plumb spent most of his working life at Christ's College, Cambridge where his stature as a scholar was acknowledged by a steady stream of honours. In parallel, Plumb also became known for the panache with which he dressed. Within the fairly conservative dress code of academic life, Sir John chose suits, ties and shirts that were often remarked upon. \n\nAccording to an obituary written by historian Simon Schama (who incidentally was taught by Plumb), Sir John 'was hardly your standard-issue cloistered, pipe-puffing don. He favoured loudly striped shirts, soft-brimmed blue fedoras, fast cars and big, dark coats'. This tie, with its luxurious plum coloured silk and designer label, formed part of the stylish wardrobe of an influential scholar.",
