It was awarded for sales of over 1,000,000 units by 12 December 1984, and would later sell double platinum. The album isn't considered one of their greatest, however, with the band moving away from raw hard rock and following other bands of the period into the area of pop-metal.\n\nThe first gold record awards were presented to artists by their own record companies to publicize 1 million sales; the first single receiving one in 1942,  with RCA presenting the first gold album award to Harry Belafonte in 1957 for the 1956 album Calypso. The RIAA was formed in 1952, and its first official designated gold record was the Oklahoma soundtrack in 1958. The platinum rating started in 1976. In 2006, the RIAA certified 84 songs as gold winners for ringtone downloads.",
