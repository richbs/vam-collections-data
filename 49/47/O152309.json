Plain weave cotton embroidered with silk in surface darning on the diagonal and running stitch.\nThe design was drawn onto the back of the fabric with ink.\nDirectional design: a faded red 8-pointed star in the centre containing a light blue and white blossom at the bottom, 2 horizontal tulips, a pair of curling leaves on either side of a central blue stem which leads into a blue blossom; there is a yellow bird either side of it and curving leaves come from the back of each bird.  A straight diagonal stem links these to a repeat of the lowest light blue and white blossom.  Surrounding the star are 4 angular sections with a light brown ground and faded red outer border. Each contains a central blossom and a pair of tulips.  This arrangement leaves 4 light blue corner segments each containing a blossom and a pair of leaves.\nThe border has a yellow ground with light brown S-shaped motifs alternating with a pink Z-shaped motif with a horizontal light blue pointed cartouche and a pair of green diagonal leaves.\nEmbroidery threads: 2S silk; white, black, yellow, green, light blue, light brown, faded red, olive green, blue, dark red, light yellow.\n\nNOTE: there are distinctly Ottoman elements in the design.  See also Circ.746-1912 and T.38-1940 for similar designs.",
