Miniatures of individual members of the Royal Family proliferated. They were useful as small precious objects that could be exchanged as gifts. The King's miniaturist, Nicholas Hilliard (possibly born in 1547, died 1619), painted this miniature of James's new son-in-law.\n\nPeople\nFrederick V (1596-1632) was Elector Palatine of the Rhine. He was a powerful German prince who ruled the part of Germany known as the Palatinate. During the Reformation, this area became a centre of Protestantism, despite being part of the Holy Roman Empire, which was Roman Catholic. Frederick's  marriage in 1613 to Princess Elizabeth (1596-1662), daughter of James I of England, united these two leading Protestant powers. Their grandson became George I of England (ruled 1714-1727), the first of the Hanoverian dynasty. The couple became King and Queen of Bohemia in 1619, but were exiled in 1621.\n\nHistorical Associations\nFrederick is shown wearing the Order of the Garter. An English order of knighthood, the Garter traditionally comprises the Sovereign and 25 Knights Companions. Frederick attached great importance to its cult of chivalry. This miniature was painted between December 1612, when he was installed as a Knight of the Garter, and April 1613, when he left England after his marriage to Princess Elizabeth. It was painted to celebrate one or other of these events.",
