            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nThe Crown's use of heraldic glass as a means of propaganda developed significantly during Henry VIII's reign (1509-47). Decorated windows of this type, showing the King's arms combined with those of his Queen, were often used in the royal palaces. Given Henry's succession of wives, they were an architectural feature that required regular alteration.\n\nHeraldry\nIn 1536 the arms of Henry VIII's third wife, Jane Seymour, were universally substituted for that of her predecessor Anne Boleyn, who had been executed in May of the same year.  On the left of this shield are the royal arms of England, on the right Jane Seymour's arms. They show her descent from five different families who bore coats of arms. The sixth section (top left when viewing, just to the right of centre) has the coat of arms granted her by Henry on their marriage. This is known as a 'coat of augmentation' and was given to elevate her status. Jane was not of royal blood and had served as lady-in-waiting to both of the King's previous wives.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe shield displays the rich effects that could be achieved by scratching through 'flashed' glass to reveal  the clear glass beneath the thin ruby layer. The clear glass could then be stained, as with the lions in the Seymour arms. A different effect could be achieved by inserting pieces of one colour into a different ground (the technique used for the fleurs-de-lis). Different glass working techniques can be observed in the near identical panel C.455-1919.\n\nPlace\nThe previous owner, who donated this panel to the Museum, reported that it came from Nonsuch Palace, Surrey, an  opulent  hunting lodge built by Henry VIII the year after Jane's death in 1537. Although there are no documents to confirm this claim, it is quite plausible.",
