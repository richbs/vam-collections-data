Inside the compartment are two large formal flowers with four large three-lobed leaves and various other formalised leaves. Above the compartment are three sprays each consisting of three formal flowers and leaves. The rest of the design consists of trailing stems bearing flowers and leaves, one of which extends up to the waist. The bodice is embroidered to match. All the frills and the hem are also edged with eyelet hole scallops and ornamented with formal six-petal flowers. There is a double line of eyelet holes around the waistband.",
