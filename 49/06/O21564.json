The stool is constructed from a steel frame with a curved sycamore seat. The seat is decorated with an oval enamelled metal plaque featuring a figure based on a sculpture of a dancing faun found in the archaeological excavations at Pompeii in the 18th century.\n\nThe use of classical imagery is a typical feature of post-modernism. Designs from the 1980s often used revived Neo-classical styles, but executed in contemporary materials. The 1980s saw an increase of designers working outside of the craft tradition, producing objects for a new style-conscious market with a high disposable income.",
