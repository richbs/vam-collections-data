Here tulips, carnations and other flowering plants seem to sway gently in a breeze, following the curved shape.\n\nThe white fritware body and brilliant underglaze colours are typical of ceramics made in Iznik. This small town in north-west Anatolia was a major centre of production and produced some of the most accomplished examples of Islamic pottery.\n \nIn the 16th century, when this piece was made, the wealth of the Ottoman rulers was reflected in sumptuous decorative arts. Their bold designs rarely included human or animal figures, preferring plant- and flower-based patterns, as here. This feature was deliberately designed to distinguish them from those produced in Iran at this time.",

The Iznik style continued to develop and another new colour, emerald green, was used extensively from the 1570s. Soon after this, though, the level of patronage of the Iznik industry began to decline, and the quality of production drifted downwards. This splendid vase therefore shows the Iznik style at its peak, with realistic tulips, carnations and other flowers freely painted against a background of pure white.",
