From the form's introduction in the early 17th century, the large two-handled cup held a high status in England. It was used as a ceremonial drinking vessel and presented as a mark of honour and reward. Until Charles II abolished the practice as an economic measure in about 1680, it had been the tradition since the Middle Ages to exchange presents at court on New Year's Day. For an archbishop, the customary gift from the king was an object weighing 46 ounces, close to the weight of the Sterne Cup.\n\nThe cup had been offered to the Museum as early as 1864. But the Museum's curator at that time, J. C. Robinson, took the view that English silver of this period was merely 'useful plate' and rejected the piece, saying, 'I do not think it can be considered as coming within the category of works of art.' By the time the cup was offered to, and acquired by, the Museum in 1925, its acquisition was suppported, as it was described by a curator in the metalwork department as 'a piece of English silver of remarkably fine character, very much more important than anything of the kind we have. It is precisely such examples of outstanding quality which are needed to give weight and solidity in building up the national collection.' The Museum was in competition to purchase the cup with the leading London silver dealer Lionel Crichton, and the cost, \u00a31,000, swallowed up the entire annual acquisition budget of the Metalwork Department. \n\nAlthough it was stressed then that 'this is just the kind of really fine work of art which we must increasingly aim at supporting', the antiquarian emphasis on the cup's royal association and the link, however tenuous, with the archbishop's great-grandson, the novelist Lawrence Sterne, who wrote Tristram Shandy, have together given the cup a special standing. This seems to have outweighed what is now perceived as its rather poor quality as a piece of goldsmith's work.",

For an archbishop, the customary gift from the king was an object weighing forty-six ounces, close to the weight of the Sterne Cup.\nAcquired in 1925, the cup had been offered to the Museum as early as 1864. But the Museum's curator at that time, J. C. Robinson, took the view that English silver of this period was merely \"useful plate\" and rejected the piece, saying, \"I do not think it can be considered as coming within the category of works of art.\" By the time the cup was offered to the Museum in 1925, its acquisition was suppported, as it was described by a curator in the metalwork department as \"a piece of English silver of remarkably fine character, very much more important than anything of the kind we have. It is precisely such examples of outstanding quality which are needed to give weight and solidity in building up the national collection.\" The Museum was in competition with the leading London silver dealer Lionel Crichton, and the cost, \u00a31,000, swallowed up the entire annual acquisition budget of the Metalwork Department. Although it was stressed then that \"this is just the kind of really fine work of art which we must increasingly aim at supporting,\" the antiquarian emphasis on the cup's royal association and the link, however tenuous, with the archbishop's great-grandson, the novelist Lawrence Sterne, author of Tristram Shandy, have together given the cup a special standing. This seems to have outweighed what is now perceived as its rather poor quality as a piece of goldsmiths work.\n\nLit. Oman, 1970, plate 11B\n\nPHILIPPA GLANVILLE",
