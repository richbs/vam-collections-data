Bartolommeo Neroni, (known as il Riccio) (1505/15?- 1571) was a Sienese painter, illuminator, architect, stage designer and engineer. His earliest works reveal the influence of Il Sodoma while his later paintings also demonstrate a close familiarity with works by  Domenico Beccafumi and Baldassare Peruzzi who were also working in Siena at that time. Neroni most likely painted the two panels depicting standing women holding attributes (425-1869; 426-1869) in the V&A collection as part of a series of three donne illustre or famous women in the poetic tradition of Petrarch and Bocaccio. These panels probably formed part of a painted series of decorations for a room in a palace and may have originally formed the back of a cassapanca or bench chest such as those painted by Beccafumi ca. 1519 for Francesco Petrucci (National Gallery, London, Doria Pamphilj, Rome). 425-1869 depicts the ancient Roman maiden Tuccia, held up as an epitome of Chastity by the ancient authors Valerius Maximus, Petrarch and Pliny as, having been accused of incest, she successfully entreated the Roman goddess Vesta to help her demonstrate her innocence by allowing her to carry a sieve of water from the Tiber River to the temple of the goddess without spilling a drop.",

London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, pp. 203-204, cat. no. 251.\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\nBartolommeo NERONI (ll Riccio) (? 1500-71/73) \nSienese School \nHe worked mainly in Siena, and also in Monte Oliveto, Lucca, and elsewhere. A pupil of Baldessare Peruzzi, he was strongly influenced by Sodoma, whose daughter he married in 1543, and by Beccafumi. His principal work is the <i>Coronation of the Virgin</i> in the Pinacoteca at Siena. \n\n251 \nCHASTITY \nTempera on panel \n29 \u00bc x 17 \u00be (74.3 x 45) \n425-1869 \n\nThis allegorical figure and its companion piece (426-1869; no. 252) were attributed to Beccafumi by Berenson (1932), Venturi (1932) and Gibellino-Krasceninnicowa (1933). The latter related them to the Sibyl in the Palazzo Doria, Rome, and the Penelope in the Episcopal Seminary in Venice (Gibellino-Krasceninnicowa, pls, xii, xv). Yet although they are similar to these figures, they are clearly inferior to them and Pope- Hennessy (1940) argued convincingly that they were most unlikely to be by Beccafumi. He attributed them to Neroni and compared in particular the head of Chastity with that of the sinner in the <i>Woman taken in Adultery</i> in Neroni's fresco of 1536 at Monte Oliveto. This attribution was accepted by Sanminiatelli (1967). \nThe significance of the sieve as a symbol of Chastity lies in its connection with the principal Vestal Virgin (C. Ripa, <i>Iconologia,</i> 1603, p. 66 f.). It was her task to carry the newly-lit fire on a sieve into the Temple of Vesta during the annual re-lighting ceremony. The allegory, therefore, derives from a knowledge of classical literature, although it does not appear that the Vestal Virgins were portrayed with a sieve in classical art. \n\nProv.

[425-1869; 426-1869] were removed with other ptgs. from the wall (West) of Rm. 108 (staircase) and stored temporarily in June 1917, when the Board of Education took over temporarily durint the rest of the war period, this portiono fht eMuseum for use as offices. F. W. Stokes'\n\nHistorical significance: Bartolommeo Neroni, (known as il Riccio) (1505/15?- 1571) was a Sienese painter, illuminator, architect, stage designer and engineer. His earliest surviving documented works, include illuminations for an Antiphonal, (signed, dated 1531\u20132, Genoa, Bib. Berio) and a fresco of <i>The Departure of SS Maurus and Placid</i> (1534) for the the convent of Monte Oliveto Maggiore reveal the influence of Il Sodoma. His later paintings also demonstrate a close familiarity with works by  Domenico Beccafumi and Baldassare Peruzzi who were also working in Siena at that time. His figures have the sharp-nosed features favoured by Beccafumi, the soft limpid eyes painted by Sodoma and the bodies and monumental spatial composition of Peruzzi. Neroni's name is associated with several important buildings in Siena and from 1552-55 he was primarily occupied with building fortifications and making military models and drawings.\nNeroni most likely painted the two panels depicting standing women holding attributes (425-1869; 426-1869) in the V&A collection as part of a series of three <i>donne illustre</i> or famous women in the poetic tradition of Petrarch and Bocaccio. These panels probably formed part of a painted series of decorations for a room in a palace and may have originally formed the back of a <i>cassapanca</i> or bench chest such as those painted by Beccafumi ca. 1519 for Francesco Petrucci (National Gallery, London, Doria Pamphilj, Rome). 425-1869 has long been described as a personification of Chastity but she may be more precisely identified as the ancient Roman maiden Tuccia, an exemplar of that virtue, and her pose suggests she orginally formed the right hand panel of the series. Tuccia is held up as an epitome of Chastity by the ancient authors Valerius Maximus, Petrarch and Pliny as, having been accused of incest, she successfully entreated the Roman goddess Vesta to help her demonstrate her innocence by allowing her to carry a sieve of water from the Tiber River to the temple of the goddess without spilling a drop. The identity of the central (missing) maiden remains unknown, although Sulpitia, praised by Bocaccio as the most highly chaste Roman matron, is a strong possibility. Like Tuccia, Sulpitia is among the illustrious women praised by Valerius Maximus and Pliny, and she appears together with Claudia Quinta (The Walters Art. Mus.; Baltimore; NG Washington respectively) in another series of virtuous women painted in the 1490s for a Sienese patrician palace.",
