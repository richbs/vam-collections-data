            "public_access_description": "Andrea Solario\u2019s earliest paintings show the influence of Antonello da Messina. Early in 1507 he was called to France to decorate the chapel of Cardinal Georges I d\u2019Amboise\u2019s ch\u00e2teau at Gaillon where he also painted a series of frescoed portraits of the Amboise family (destr. in French Revolution). After his return to Milan, Andrea worked briefly for Cardinal d\u2019Amboise\u2019s nephew and heir, Charles II d\u2019Amboise, Governor of Milan. Solario\u2019s works show a gradual evolution from the sharp precision towards a softer, more graceful manner. His distinctive style combines brilliant colour with influences from Antonello and Leonardo. His art also betrays a remarkably keen understanding of works by the early Flemish masters, which he could easily have encountered in Venice, Milan and France. Also reflecting northern models was his use of a technique combining oil and tempera.\nPreviously attributed to Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio (ca. 1467-1516) and Filippo Mazzola (ca.1460-1505), since1962 the V&A picture has been attributed to another Milanese painter, Andrea Solario. Nevertheless, the work closely resembles Boltraffio's Portrait of Gerolamo Casio of ca. 1495 (Pinacoteca di Brera, Milan) which similarly depicts a long haired young poet wearing laurel and a red cloak against a dark ground. There is also a similar treatment of light and shade and represention of physiognomy, evident for example in the stongly outlined almond shaped eyes which turn towards the beholder, the broad flat cheeks and slightly pointed chin. A close comparison can also be made with Solario's Portrait of a Young Man dated after 1490 in the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, Madrid.",

F. Cook suggested that it was more probably by Mazzola. This attribution was supported by Berenson in his list of 1932 and it remains reasonably convincing. But, considering the extent of the repainting, it would be rash to treat this as more than tentative. \nX-ray photographs show the fragment of a previous painting of a saint with a gold halo underneath the portrait. \n\nCondition.

Educated at Newcastle Grammar School and University College London, he was a student in the Inner Temple 1828 and qualified as a barrister 1843.  Began his career as a journalist as dramatic critic of the <u>True Sun</u> 1832; he later edited the <u>Foreign Quarterly Review</u> (1842-3), the <u>Daily News</u> (1846) and most famously the <u>Examiner</u> (1847-55).  He was the author of numerous works, notably the <u>Life and Adventures of Oliver Goldsmith</u> (1848) and the <u>Life of Charles Dickens</u> (1872-4).  He bequeathed his extensive collection of books, pamphlets, manuscripts, prints, drawings, watercolours and oil paintings to the V&A.  \nSee also <u>South Kensington Museum Art Handbooks.

Early in 1507 he was called to France to decorate the chapel of Cardinal Georges I d\u2019Amboise\u2019s ch\u00e2teau at Gaillon. Andrea was at Gaillon until 1509, where he also painted a series of frescoed portraits of the Amboise family (destr. in French Revolution). After his return to Milan, Andrea worked briefly for Cardinal d\u2019Amboise\u2019s nephew and heir, Charles II d\u2019Amboise, Governor of Milan. Solario\u2019s works show a gradual evolution from the sharp precision towards a softer, more graceful manner. His distinctive style combines brilliant colour with influences from Antonello and Leonardo. His art also betrays a remarkably keen understanding of works by the early Flemish masters, which he could easily have encountered in Venice, Milan and France. Also reflecting northern models was his use of a technique combining oil and tempera.\nF.1 has been previously attributed to Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio (ca. 1467-1516) and Filippo Mazzola (ca.1460-1505). In 1962 Fritz Heinemann gave the work instead to another Milanese painter, Andrea Solario. The work closely resembles Boltraffio's <i>Portrait of Gerolamo Casio</i> of ca. 1495 (Pinacoteca di Brera, Milan) which similarly depicts a long haired young poet wearing laurel and a red cloak against a dark ground. There is also a similar treatment of light and shade and represention of physiognomy, evident for example in the stongly outlined almond shaped eyes which turn towards the beholder, the broad flat cheeks and slightly pointed chin. A close comparison can also be made with Solario's <i>Portrait of a Young Man</i> dated after 1490 in the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, Madrid.",

            "historical_context_note": "In his encyclopaedic work, <i>Historia Naturalis,</i> the ancient Roman author Pliny the Elder described the origins of painting in the outlining of a man's projected shadow in profile. In the ancient period, profile portraits were found primarily in imperial coins. With the rediscovery and the increasing interest in the Antique during the early Renaissance, artists and craftsmen looked back to this ancient tradition and created medals with profile portraits on the obverse and personal devise on the reverse in order to commemorate and celebrate the sitter. Over time these profile portraits were also depicted on panel and canvas and progressively evolved towards three-quarter and eventually frontal portraits. These portraits differ in many ways from the notion of portraiture commonly held today as they especially aimed to represent an idealised image of the sitter and reflect therefore a different conception of identity. The sitter's likeness was more or less recognisable but his particular status and familiar role were represented in his garments and attributes referring to his character. In the16th century especially metaphorical and visual attributes were included to elaborate highly complex portraits.",
