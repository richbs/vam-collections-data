In 1997 Nathalie launched a collection of handcrafted, limited edition handbags, represented in the Victoria & Albert Museum's permanent collections as well as in the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York. Her first public foray into clothing was in 2004 with the launch of her signature collection \"Secours Populaire\" which includes clothes, fashion accessories and fragrances.\n\nThis metallic silver ensemble and blue T-shirt belong to her May 2005 project, the launch of her new brand 'Full of Chic'. Most of the products within this collection - which include clothes, accessories and jewellery - are intended to blur the sexual and seasonal divides and follow Nathalie's sartorial philosophy that men and women should mix and match: old and new, cheap and expensive, classic and trendy. This ensemble is representative of Hambro's clean, pared-down clothing and her aim to design clothes that are fresh and colourful.",
