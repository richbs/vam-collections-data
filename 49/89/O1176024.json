It is made of yellow silk damask in 4/1 satin, using the full width of the damask with an extra piece seamed at each side to create the required width. It is shaped with cut-out areas to fit around the chair legs. The damask's design is in point repeat (creating a mirror-image of the design to either side of a central axis), with stylised plants and flowers, that slightly evoke chinoiserie. The design has been carefully placed to be seen to best advantage on the seat.\nThe front and sides are decorated towards their edges with an abstract floral  design in applique of white satin embellished with pale blue embroidery. The embroidery is in the form of laid and couched fine cord and chenille thread, with small details embroidered directly into the damask. Traces of the underdrawing can be seen in places, in black ink.\nThe back of the cover is of pieced linen. There are three pairs of hooks and eyes at each corner to secure the cover at the back of the chair legs.",
