Jewellers followed this tradition, or even took it a step further, by recycling materials to make entirely new creations. With today's consciousness of global warming and the need to use sustainable materials the jeweller of the future will undoubtedly engage more with recyclables. \n\nChang created his early jewellery from recycled materials and found objects. Today he uses disposable plastics from everyday life. In a time consuming and labour intensive process he transforms these into sculptural jewellery with vibrant colours. His exuberant wearable objects are truly unique, the plastics appear like precious lacquer work and his designs are metamorphosed into surreal works of art.  Chang likes the irony of making an artistic statement with an object meant to last, which has been designed from materials meant to be thrown away.\n\nHis training in printmaking and sculpture is ever evident in his work. Apart from jewellery he has also made furniture and designed gardens.",
