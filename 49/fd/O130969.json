II, pp. 122-3, cat.949\nThe following is the full text of the catalogue entry: \n\n'CANALETTO\nAntonio Canale (<i>1697-1768</i>)\n\n\n949\nArchitectural capriccio, with reminiscences of Montagu House, London \nPen and ink and wash over pencil \n9 7/8 x 151 1/8(251 x 384) \tE.3791-1934 \nPROVENANCE John Barnard (inscribed on the back in his hand 493; Lugt 1419, 1420); Archdeacon Charles Parr Burney; his daughter Mrs Rosetta d'Arblay Wood (inscribed on the back RDWI8); her daughter Miss Edith Mary Burke Wood, afterwards Lady Powell; bequeathed by Lady Powell, 1934 \nLITERATURE Constable, p. 149, and p. 546, no. 786a; the same, Catalogue of a Canaletto exhibition held at Toronto and Montreal, Canada, 1964-65, no. 123 \nThe capriccio is based on the terrace of old Montagu House beside the Thames, a theme that Canaletto treated in several other drawings. In this drawing the features that recall Montagu House are the cube-shaped pavilion overlooking the Thames, which is fairly accurately represented, and the house with a classical pediment on the right, which, though much reduced in scale, still evokes Montagu House through its situation and its pediment. The classical porch next to it is an invention; Westminster Bridge is missing; and the water looks more like a lagoon than a river. Constable infers from the calligraphic handling that the drawing was made in Venice after Canaletto's return from London, that is to say after 1755. \nHe lists three other versions of the drawing, all by Canaletto, as follows: Constable, no. 786, in the Staedelsches Kunstinstitut, Frankfurt; Constable, no. 786b, in the possession of Lord Howard de Walden; Constable, no. 786c, in the British Museum (1866.7.14.10.). A similar theme is also treated in Constable, no. 753, in the possession of Mr P. de Boer, Amsterdam, a drawing which corresponds more closely with reality than the group discussed above. The topographical aspects of this drawing are discussed by F. J. B. Watson in an article on 'Some unpublished Canaletto drawings of London' in <i>The Burlington Magazine</i>, 92, 1950, p. 315. \nFor a reliable view of Montagu House terrace as it was in Canaletto's day see the various paintings by Samuel Scott in the possession of the Tate Gallery, The Fishmongers' Company, the Duke of Buccleuch and the Lord St Just (whose picture is reproduced as pl. 42 in the illustrated catalogue of an exhibition of early drawings and pictures of London, held at the Burlington Fine Arts Club in 1920).'\n\nPeter Ward Jackson, 1979\nBeddington, Charles, <i>Canaletto in England</i> Yale Center for British Art, 2006, cat. no. 65\nExhibition catalogue\n<u>Victoria & Albert Museum Department of Engraving, Illustration and Design & Department of Paintings Accessions 1934</u> London: Published under the Authority of the Board of Education, 1935\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n<b>CANELETTO, Antonio (1697-1768).</b>\nCapriccio : a paved quay with buildings, statues and figures beside a lagoon, and a tower on a distant shore. \n     <i>Pen and ink and wash.</i>     (9 7/8 x 15 1/8)                                                                         E. 3791-1934\n                                                      Bequeathed by Edith, Lady Powell.\n     <i>Note.</i>-The drawing bears, both in the margin and on the back, the collectior's mark of john barnard (d. 1784), in whose collection it was no. 793 (Lugt, 1419, 1420). Three drawings, \"Views in Venice\", by Canaletto, figured in the Barnard sale in 1787 and fetched \u00a36-10-0, \u00a315-10-0 respectively. The drawing may have passed into the collection of Dr. Thomas Munro before becoming the property of Charles Parr Burney, successively Archdeacon of St. Albans and Colchester, whose collection was inherited by his daughter, Mrs. Rosetta d'Arblay Wood. Her iitials, \"R D W,\" and the number 18, are inscribed in pencil on the back of the drawing. It passed from Mrs. Wood to her younger daughter, Edith Mary Burke Wood, who married Sir Richard Douglas Powell, Bt., K.C.V.O. (1842-1925), and bequeathed 32 drawings to the Museum.\n     Another version of the same subject is in the collection of Mr. George A. Simonson, london. A signed drawing which has many points of resemblance but has been wrongly entitled \"By the new bridge inb Lodnon\", is in the St\u00e4delschen Kunstinstitut, Frankfort (Inv no. 459), It seems more likely that these subjects are \"Capriccios\" combining motifs from more than one place.
