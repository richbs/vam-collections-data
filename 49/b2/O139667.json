During the 17th century, this intrument supplied the bass in music ensembles. This example is undated and is signed simply John Rose, so it could have been made by either the father (ca. 1530 \u2013 ca. 1597) or the son (ca 1560\u20131611), who both had the same name. The Roses were the leading viol makers in London in their day, and this instrument is probably one of the earliest English viols to have survived. The father traded from Bridewell Palace, which was owned by the City of London by 1553 and was partly hired out for workshops. The most famous instrument made by either the father or the son was an orpharion, a wire-strung instrument that resembled a lute, signed Ioannes Rosa and dated 1580, which is currently at Helmingham Hall, Suffolk.",
