Upper 5 cms. plain weave as above with a fringe of warp threads grouped in 7s and tied with a single knot; 14 cms. long.  Only dark brown hair remains in the fringe because the woollen component has decayed, although it can be seen in the signle knot and in the warp.\n\nDESIGN: Field: dark purple ground with 4 rows of 15 bands of irregular horned diamonds alternately white and pink, the pink having a vertical dark blue hooked bar and 3 diamonds and 4 stylised flowers.  The bar in the white diamonds is pink with the same decoration.  Offset at 5 rows of smaller irregular diamonds with a blue or dark blue ground.  There are 14 and 2 half bands of these, all containing an 8-pointed orange star containing a dark blue and white quartered diamond and in the four corners, a pink, white - centred triangle.  Each of these secondary irregular diamonds is enclosed by a fine pink and white line bearing pink and white flowerheads which, when joined vertically, create a lattice-like appearnance.  The pattern along both sides is inconsistent - flowers in the lower half and half diamonds in the upper half.\n\nMain border: along the sides this has a white ground with opposed hooked triangles paired by colour; along the top and bottom the white ground has stepped lozenges each containing 4 diamonds.\n\nInner and outer borders: red ground with geometric meander in purple with blocks of various colours.\n\nOutermost border: only along the sides and the top edge, undecorated purple pile, along bottom, purple diamonds with white crosses.  The border is infilled with white triangles.\n\nUpper and lower bands: dark purple ground with a band of 9 plants hooked top and bottom , each with three pairs of serrated leaves, separated by a hooked vertical stem bearing theee 3-pointed motifs in white and yellow.  At the exrteme top and bottom there is a narrow band of a chevron-like design in several colours.  At the lower right hand corner, there is a row of 4 stepped lozenges.",
