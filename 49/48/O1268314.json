Although rare as a theatrical souvenir type, the decision to commission a lunchbox is extremely appropriate for a production based on Roald Dahl\u2019s tale about a school girl and a production attended by a large number of students. \n\nIn addition to demonstrating how theatrical souvenirs can help provide information about an audience's expected constituency,  the lunchbox also highlights the importance of marketing , branding and merchandise to the theatre industry today.",
