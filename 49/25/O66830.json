The hexagonal medallions have a floral chequer-like fill, the central medallion with a green ground and the lower and smallest and the upper and largest with a white ground.  The central and side concentrics share a white, linked outer border bearing tiny red and blue crosses.  The borders of the half rows are consistently (apart from the lower quarters) in bule, light brown, blue, light brown, green, red but the complete concentrics vary - the outer ones including a yellow border.  All borders bear the cross motif which, in the lowest part of the field, is occasionally a distinct floret.\nMain border: dark brown (decayed) ground in all borders but the lower, where it is dark blue.  Stylised white rosettes with floral centres and pseudo-kufic (debased) hooked bars, also in white, are all outlined in red.\nInner border: yellow ground bearing linked 'S' motifs in red.  On the surviving outer side borders the same motif has a white ground.\nDate catalogued: 11.12.96",
