Cardew believed that traditional Nigerian earthenwares were perfectly adapted for their purposes and could not be improved upon, but he proposed the introduction of a centre where potters would be trained to make glazed stonewares for new markets. The Pottery Training Centre he founded at Abuja (present-day Suleja) supported new pottery enterprises, but its greater impact came through its manufacture of high-quality pots for local and overseas markets. These pots expressed, as Cardew saw it, an African sensibility using techniques developed in Europe and East Asia. Following Cardew's departure in 1965, the centre was run by Michael O'Brien.\n\nThis oil jar was bought at Abuja in the late 1960s by Michael and Dorothy Kirkbride, a British architect and painter respectively, who were then living and working in Nigeria.",
