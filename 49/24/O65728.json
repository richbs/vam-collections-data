A naked boy, Sudaya, standing in <i>anjalimudra</i> on the right and the same boy crouching inside an arched  tomb near his dead mother provide the key to this narrative scene.  On the high base, on the right one can see the toes of a  foot which may belong to the Buddha to whom all these remaining figures are facing.  Inside the funeral monument Sudaya is crouching on the floor with his right hand on the body of his dead mother stretched out before him, with her dishevelled hair tumbling over the edge of the base.  Behind the tomb stands the erect figure of a turbaned and bejewelled prince holding the end of his <i>uttariya</i> which is looped round his body. He appears to be carrying a bunch of flowers in its lower fold , which Ackermann suggests may identify him as the converted father of Sudaya. A further turbaned figure stands behind him next to a robed figure with curls and <i>ushnisha</i>, who may be a bodhisattva.  There are seven further figures in two registers making a variety of gesticulations. Only two of these retain their faces.",

The carving was given by Major Robert Grenville Gayer-Anderson Pasha, (1881-1945), the Orientalist, and his twin brother, Colonel Thomas Gayer Gayer-Anderson, who were  both noted collectors. The major, known as 'John', spent most of his adult life in Egypt and only returned to England to live with his brother due to bad health in 1942 at which time this gift with a number of other Indian artifacts was made. Colonel Thomas Gayer Gayer-Anderson made a notable collection of Indian paintings, which were largely collected during his  military service at Pune (then named Poona) on the General Staff 1926-1930. This carving and the other Indian artefacts donated at this time probably were also collected during this period.\n\nThe narrative in the relief  bears similarities to a relief from Jamal Garhi, in Peshawar ( No 1885), which is described with an illustration by Ingholt, !957. He describes how the youngest  pregnant wife of a certain king was buried alive following a conspiracy hatched by the jealous elder wives.  Such were the merits of both the young wife and her unborn child from his former lives, that she gave birth to him after her death. The child was able to suckle at her breast and lived for three years in the tomb until it became ruinous enough for him to escape from it, whereupon he lived for a further three years alone in the jungle until the Buddha came upon him and made him a monk.\n\nAckermann, Hans Christoph. <u>Narrative stone reliefs from Gandhara in the</u> <u>Victoria and Albert Museum in London</u> : catalogue and attempt at a stylistic history Rome : IsMEO, 1975. p128-9, plate LVIb.",
