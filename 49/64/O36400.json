It is simply carved and partly painted in ochre and brown; together with red and blue-black designs representing floral patterns and single flowers on the head dress and dress. Around the neckline are dots of these two colours with matching stripes on the sleeves. Around the woman's neck is painted a dark pink ribbon and bow. The facial features are indicated by two pink cheek dots; black dot eyes and a red mouth. The child figure is not separately painted. The figure appears to be standing on a block and it is flat at the back with a high semi-circular head dress. \n*This is a symbolic doll type showing the protection and comfort given by the adult to the child - a symbol of protection not necessarily simply between adults and children but between people and people and animals. \nA N Varganov is a well known and internationally known maker of these toys. His work is represented in other museums in the USA; Australia; Japan and Germany. He comes from a traditional craft family making these types of toys; both wooden and papier mach\u00e9; from before 1900.",
