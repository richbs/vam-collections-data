There are several versions of this cabinet, made of various exotic and native woods, with different patterns of inlay.  Designs for the inlay, grilles and mounts were included in a collection of drawings, Tracings by Thomas Wilkinson from the designs of the late Mr George Bullock 1820, now in Birmingham Museum. After Bullock's unexpectedly early death in 1818, his business was sold and the sale catalogue listed several collections of designs, including, possibly, the Wilkinson tracings.  Bullock's designs may therefore have been used by other cabinet-makers.\n\nThe raised section on the top of this cabinet was probably intended for a bust or large ornamental vase. Inside, the cabinet is fitted with shelves, which may have been used for books.",
