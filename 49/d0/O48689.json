It is one of 31 similar works which William Marshall Craig produced to illustrate Modern London, a guide book published by Richard Phillips in 1804.  Since the V&A already possesses 10 watercolours from the series, this new acquisition is an especially welcome addition to the collection.\n\nThe bookshop shown in this watercolour was owned by Benjamin Tabart (1767/8-1833), who also ran his specialist children's publishing company, The Juvenile & School Library, from the premises.  As fellow publishers and possibly former business partners, Tabart and Richard Phillips were closely connected: advertising, selling and even reprinting one another's books. That Craig was instructed to illustrate Tabart's shop was evidently a friendly gesture on Phillips' part; probably he hoped to offer his colleague a bit of free publicity."

It is one of 31 similar works which William Marshall Craig (c.1750-c.1828) produced to illustrate Modern London, a guide book published by Richard Phillips in 1804.  The V&A already possesses 10 watercolours from the series.\n\nThe bookshop shown in this watercolour was owned by Benjamin Tabart (1767/8-1833), who also ran his specialist children's publishing company, The Juvenile & School Library, from the premises.  As fellow publishers and possibly former business partners, Tabart and Richard Phillips were closely connected: advertising, selling and even reprinting one another's books. That Craig was instructed to illustrate Tabart's shop was evidently a friendly gesture on Phillips' part; probably he hoped to offer his colleague a bit of free publicity.",

Some made of slight deal, covered like the others, but in addition to the greater strength having a lock and key, sell according to their size, from three shillings and sixpence to six shillings each.  The crier of Band-boxes or his family manufacture them; and these cheap articles of convenience are only to be bought of the persons who cry them through the streets.'\n\nThere then follows a note about Tabart's shop:\n\n'The Biblioteque d'Education, or TABART'S Juvenile Library, seen to the left of the Plate, is in New Bond-street, at the corner of Grafton-street.  It is a very admirable and unique Institution, where all elementary books of science and education are to be found, in addition to every moral and amusing publication that can \"teach the young ideas how to shoot,/Or pour the fresh instruction o'er the mind.\"'",
