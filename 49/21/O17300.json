Bermingham, 2005, pp. 23-24\n<u>100 Great Paintings in The Victoria & Albert Museum</u>. London: V&A, 1985, p. 82\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"Thomas Gainsborough 1727-1788\n<i>British School</i> \nTRANSPARENCY: COTTAGE AND POND, MOONLIGHT \nOil on glass, 28 X 33.6 cm \nP.33-1955. <i>Bequeathed by E E Cook through the NACF.</i> \n\nIn 1781 Gainsborough's friend Philip de Loutherbourg astonished London by the display of his <i>Eidophusikon</i>, or <i>Representation of Nature</i>. This elaborate contrivance, consisted of a six-foot wide stage with brilliant lamps, slips of stained glass, trees made from cork and moss, mechanical models, transparencies and sound effects which were all employed to produce moving scenic effects. On one occasion Gainsborough was helping to produce the sound effect of a thunder storm by shaking a sheet of copper, when a real thunder storm broke out. De Loutherbourg gripped Gainsborough by the arm, and said 'Our thunder is better, by God!'. \n\nGainsborough's experience in helping with this apparatus, and his knowledge of contemporary stained glass painting, inspired him to produce a set of ten, or possibly twelve, transparencies, one of which is reproduced here. They were viewed in a peep-show 'show-box', illuminated from behind by four small candles and seen through a lens. The light was diffused and varied by a coloured silk screen inserted between the candles and the glass, so that remarkable flickering effects of light were produced.\n\nA painting on opaque canvas can only achieve a luminance scale of 20 to 1, but by painting on glass a far greater approximation can be achieved to the luminance scale of nature which can reach 760 to 1 on a bright sunny day. Gainsborough enjoyed experimenting with the wider range of tonal effects available by using a glass support as can be seen in this moonlit nocturn with its dramatically lighted cottage door and windows, a characteristic picturesque subject. Some of the other transparencies relate closely to oil paintings by Gainsborough, and it seems probable that he painted many more than these surviving examples, experimenting with similar compositions both on glass and canvas.\n\nLionel Lambourne\"\nHayes, John. <u>The landscape paintings of Thomas Gainsborough: a critical text and catalogue raisonn\u00e9</u>.

Gainsborough's rather amateurish box (pls 171, 172) consisted of a large storage space, containing twelve slats, to house his transparencies; a system of cords and pulleys to hoist the desired transparency into position; four slats behind this position, into anyone of which could be inserted a semi-transparent silk screen; and, at the back, five candle-holders. The spectator viewed the transparencies through a large round peep-hole, fitted with a magnifying lens, in the front of the box. The lens could be adjusted to between 25\u00bd and 34\u00bd inches of the projected transparency, thus producing an image with a magnification of between two-and-a-half and five times the size of the original, according to the length of adjustment. The light transmitted from the candles behind, albeit diffused through the silk screen, produced a luminosity close to that in nature impossible to achieve in oil painting on an opaque support. It is not known whether the transparencies were intended to be viewed with the painted surface facing the candle or the spectator; there is optical evidence to favour the former method, but this matter, and others connected with the box, require further investigation (the reproductions in the present catalogue are all of the painted surface). (I am grateful to Mr Lionel Lambourne and Mr John Murdoch, of the Victoria and Albert Museum, for their help, and for allowing me to examine the official file.) Gainsborough must have painted numerous transparencies for showing in his box, but only ten survive (this one and cat. nos 133, 134, 139, 140, 154, 155, 172, 173 and 177): all these are completely tonal in quality, executed in a range of blues, greens and browns, and Gainsborough's aim was clearly to heighten and dramatize his effects of light. This is the first occasion on which Gainsborough painted a moonlight scene and the first in which he tried out an indoor lighting effect: the window, and the doorway against which the figure is silhouetted, are brilliantly illumined by fire-light (the similar effect in the cottage window in the Rutland <i>The Woodcutter's Return</i> (cat. no. 105) is caused by the rays of the setting sun). Edward Edwards described the effects produced by Gainsborough's transparencies as 'truly captivating, especially in the moon-light pieces, which exhibit the most perfect resemblance of nature'. Also mentioned on pp. 141, 142. \n\nDATING   Identical with cat. no. 133 in the spindly tree-trunks, the rapid handling and highlighting of the soft, washy foliage, and the fluid treatment of the foreground. The motif of the cottage beside a pool is related to cat. no. 135.\"",
