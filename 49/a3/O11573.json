A few finely-potted mid-17th-century delftware versions have survived, as have some very basic earthenware candlesticks of the 16th and 17th centuries, sometimes with crude trailed slip decoration. It is clear, however, that the more expensive metal was much preferred. The function of this Wrotham piece must always have been secondary to its purpose as a presentation and display object.\n\nTrading\nThough the decorative Wrotham slipwares have survived in surprising numbers, covering the period 1612-1739, their place in the story of the development of English ceramics is less important than might appear. The farmer-potter families of the small Kent village of Wrotham made objects of daily use such as bread-crocks, chicken feeders etc.,  as well as a small range of inscribed slipwares commissioned by local people.",
