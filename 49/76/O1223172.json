She studied for her MFA at the Slade in 2007-9, and in 2009 was the winner of the prestigious Clifford Chance Postgraduate Printmaking Prize.\n\nPrint - etching, screenprint, woodcut - is her primary medium but she is not a printmaker in the conventional sense. In much of her work the printed element is the starting point for a three-dimensional work in which she plays variously with volume, space, surface and shadow. Much of her work involves explorations of the idea of repetition - which is of course fundamental to printmaking - but sometimes the repetition occurs within the confines of a single piece (as in the 'Truncated Element' series, which employs versions of a repeating pattern) or it mutates from one piece to the next; sometimes the repetition is inherent in the form - for example wallpaper. Malmros often complicates the idea of the repeat by cutting and folding areas of the print to negotiate between two and three dimensions in a single work. In this piece, Truncated Element III, there is complex interplay between negative and positive (black / white, printed areas / cut-out spaces) as well as subtle use of shadow and reflection.",
