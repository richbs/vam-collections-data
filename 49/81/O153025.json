The central square [57.5 cm square] has a dark red ground with a mass of pale blue branches and blossoms with highlights in yellow, red and white which may be forming a series of meanders. This panel is framed by a yellow band containing a repeating,  rigid motif of three inward facing stems with flowers in green and blue. Beyond this is a white band [a] with a green meandering stem with a pattern of two red and one blue flowers and a flying green parakeet. Beyond is a wide dark red band with a thin green meandering stem holding six different exotic blossoms in blue, red and white with smaller leaves and flowers including pomegranates.  The six blossoms are repeated along each side of the cover and there are two different corner motifs.  Band [a] is repeated and the outermost band has reciprocal trefoils in red and green.\nThe backing is pieced, salmon pink cotton twill.\nThe facing is bias cut, plain weave blue cotton.",
