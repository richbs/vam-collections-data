            "public_access_description": "This bottle, with its globular body and long tapering cylindrical neck, is typical of the experimentation with organic forms that typified the French Art Pottery movement at the turn of the century.\n\nHoentschel was a friend and admirer of the sculptor and ceramicist Jean Carri\u00e8s, with whom he worked in the early 1890s and with whom he shared a keen interest in Japanese ceramics. Japanese style  prompted an altogether looser aesthetic, rich surface patination, and abstracted decoration, as seen in the glaze and gold effects on this bottle.\n\nThis bottle is of stoneware. The elevation of stoneware to an art medium in France followed the exhibition of traditional Japanese wares in Paris in 1878.\n\nGeorges Hoentschel (1855-1915) was an architect, sculptor and collector, as well as a ceramicist. He was born in the same year as his close friend Jean Carri\u00e8s who was a great influence on his contemporaries, including Hoentschel, in his use of stoneware as an art material. Hoentschel enthusiastically followed Carri\u00e8s to St Amand-en-Puisaye, adopting the potter's life in about 1888-90.  Like Carri\u00e8s he was keenly interested in Bizen and Seto wares, adding the gold to this 'vase' in reference to Japnese ceramics.  As a collector, Hoentschel amassed French art from the middle ages to his own time.  By 1908 he had sold the major proportion of the earlier pieces to J.Pierpoint Morgan, who subsequently presented them to the Metropolitan Museum in New York.  Hoentschel showed his own collection of Carri\u00e8s' ceramics in the international exhibtion, Paris, 1900, where he was also responsible for design and arrangement of the highly praised Salon des Bois .  He presented the Carri\u00e8s ceramics to the French state in 1900 after the much-loved potter's' early death.  In 1904 Hoentschel was exhibiting his own ceramics in the international exhibition in St Louis and towards the end of his life he returned to Paris to work at a friend's studio until his death in 1915.",
