Sadler experimented with transfer-printing on white glazed delftware tiles, transferring images from engraved copper plates to tiles, using enamel colours fixed in low-temperature firing.\n\nActors and actresses could become big stars in the 18th century, when theatres, concert halls and pleasure gardens were the major forms of public entertainment.  Engravers regularly produced images of paintings of the most popular performers, so the ability to reproduce engravings on ceramics was a lucrative development.  Since the engravings were transfer-printed, the original images appear on the tiles in reverse.\n\nCharles Macklin (1699-1797) was born in Ireland.  He may have started his stage career around 1720, playing Harlequin with strolling players, and his first appearance on the London stage was probably at Lincoln's Inn Fields in 1725.  In 1733 he appeared at Drury Lane in The Recruiting Officer.He persuaded the management there to revive The Merchant of Venice which made him famous overnight for his Shylock. Well known for his quarrelsome nature and 'his rough mind and rougher manner', it is said that he lived in the shadow of David Garrick and never achieved the recognition he deserved. His last appearance on stage was in May 1789 when he attempted Shylock, but was unable to finish it.",
