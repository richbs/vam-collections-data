The son of Apollo and Coronis, Asklepius was the ancient Greek God of Medicine and healing. His attribute is usually a staff with an intertwined snake, the rod of Asklepius, which is still a symbol of medicine today.\n\nFanelli was born in Florence in about 1577, and documented in Genoa in 1608, where, until about 1631, he produced religious works in marble, silver, ivory and bronze. By 1635, he was working at the English court. Although he described himself 'sculptor to the King of Great Britain', it is unclear whether this was his official title. The V&A owns versions of several small bronzes by the artist, described as 'ffrancisco the one-eyed Italian' in an inventory of Whitehall Palace in 1639. George Vertue stated that Fanelli 'lv'd and dyd in England'.  He is last documented in 1641 and believed to have died soon after.",
