By this time the theatre, built in 1674 on the site of an earlier playhouse, seemed old-fashioned and in need of renovation. Minor improvements were made to the interior, then in 1775 Garrick employed the famous architect Robert Adam to re-design the whole building inside and out. \n\nThis late 18th century painting shows Adam's imposing  neo-classical entrance on Brydges Street (now Catherine Street).  The original building had been licensed by Charles II and therefore was entitled to call itself the Theatre Royal. Adam acknowledged this by placing carved figures of a lion and a unicorn, the emblems of British Royalty, on the triangular pediment. The Royal Arms are shown on a medallion in the centre. At the apex is a classical trophy of Greek armour and weapons.\n\nAdam's design was celebrated in contemporary engravings. These emphasised the grandeur and depicted the new entrance as a palatial structure towering over tiny passers-by. By contrast this painting appears to be a realistic representation of what the unknown artist has seen in Brydges Street, including the pawnbroker's shop to the left of the theatre and the inn to the right.",
