More of a philosophy than mere design movement, Pugin described Gothic in 1836 as \"the only correct expression of the faith, wants, styles and climate of our country\". It became virtually a national style when chosen for the rebuilding of the Houses of Parliament in 1835. This salt cellar (one from a set of four) was designed by Pugin for his own house, 'The Grange', in Ramsgate. The set remained in the Pugin family until 1976, when two of the salt cellars and their spoons were purchased by the Museum.",
