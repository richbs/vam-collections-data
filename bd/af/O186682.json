One of the most popular designs was the girandole, with three drops hanging from a central boss.  This 17th century pattern survived until the end of the 19th century with traditional costume in Italy.  This earring was originally a girandole, but two of the drops are now missing.  Girandole earrings were found throughout central and northern Italy in the 19th century.  \n\nThis earring was acquired in the Abruzzi, and was described as a bridal gift.  The Abruzzi is a remote and mountainous area of central Italy, and traditional jewellery survived there longer than in many other parts of the country.  It was formerly part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, and the jewellery is often different from that found elsewhere in northern and central Italy.  Italian earrings are usually made of thin gold, or gilt metal, but in the Abruzzi all kinds of jewellery were often made of heavy silver.  \n\nThis earring was bought as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
