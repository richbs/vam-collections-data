By the late nineteenth century, when this vessel was  produced, the Dehua kilns were a well established centre for production of devotional images and European figures. Direct copies of European designs were less numerous than in Jingdezhen while direct imitations of shapes and designs used in European factories were very rare. This piece is a unique exception as no other examples have so far been identified. The date of this vessel is also in dispute as it could been produced between 1785 and 1820, during the period of the English originals. However the decline of ceramic output from Dehua suggests the piece would have been much later, at the end of the nineteenth century, when production had been revived and European demand was great.",
