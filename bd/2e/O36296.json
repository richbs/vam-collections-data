The legs and rider\nare separately attached. It is light and dark brown; with white; black and yellow. Its tail is unravelled white thread and the reins a white thread. The integral key protrudes from the right shoulder of the body which houses the clockwork mechanism. Around the middle of the body is a band of red and black striped cloth which covers the open allowing the movement of the horse. When wound the horse's body opens and narrows at the middle forcing the legs to open and close and move the whole forward. The rider; representing a jockey; is coloured red; yellow; blue; black; tan and white. The figure sits forward of the body join. \n*The mark is a K within a 5 petalled stylized flower. It is similar to that used by Yonezawa Toys of Tokyo.",
