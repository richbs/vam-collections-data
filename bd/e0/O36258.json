Attached to the back with screws is the opening hatch plate section to which are fitted the mud guards (right one is broken off). The top is high at the back slowly sloping to a shallow nose. The top is moulded to show the large round turret on the left, a forward hatch, an oval hatch on the right and square hatches at the back. The engine exhaust pipe is on the right side and there are several walkway grip pads over the surface which itself has been given a rough texture. The round turret and the front hatch have been cut out and have their own covers. At the front large clear plastic head lamps have been added as well as small coloured dots as indicator lights; these have also been added at the back. Two decals have been attached, one the battalion emblem and the other ACTION MAN TRANSPORT COMMAND 2. cover for the turret, oval with steel pins which fit into the slots on the turret top \n3. mud guard, plastic with a strip of soft black plastic; it has the remains of glue on the edge\n4. flag on a grey plastic pole which would also act as a radio aerial; flag is a red a blue paper pennant \n5. machine gun, black and silver plastic; this was contained in the body",
