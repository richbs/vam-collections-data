            "public_access_description": "Circular micromosaic tabletops with complex iconological programmes were a specialty of the workshop of Michelangelo Barberi in Rome and are among the most outstanding works ever produced in this medium. Barberi was trained as a painter and the pictorial was central to his \u0153uvre - at times to a degree that seems to defy the very essence of a mosaic. The endless shades of glass colours and the seamlessly colour-matched interstices render the illusion of a painted surface almost perfect.\n\nBarberi postulated that technical perfection was not an aim in itself, but needed to be accompanied by a patriotic calling - a 'service to Rome' and Italy. As a result of this postulation, mosaic as a medium is a message in itself: the ancient art form - as revived and refined in Christian times at the Vatican Workshops - testifies to the successful connection between antiquity and the present, as well as the continuity and renaissance of Roman traditions in Barberi's time.\n\n\"The Four Ages of the History of the Eternal City\"  are the subject-matter of the tabletop, and are introduced by four portrait medals: \"a king, a consul, an emperor and a pope.\" The fourth age, Christianity, is represented by the central view of Saint Peter's Square. The views and trophies on the outer ring are chronologically arranged and need to be read counter-clockwise, beginning with the view of the Palatine Hill as legendary place of the foundation of Rome.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes. Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",

The first micromosaics were created in the 18th century, but it was not until Arthur Gilbert himself became interested in collecting them and invented the term 'micromosaics' that they became known as such. The tesserae are minute pieces cut from thin pieces of glass known as smalti filati, and some of the finest micomosaics can consist of as many as 5,000 tesserae per square inch (ca. 3 by 3cm). By the late 18th century Rome had become central to the production of micromosaics and sold them as souvenirs to wealthy foreigners visiting the city. From small elegant snuffboxes to large monumental tabletops, micromosaics could be used to decorate objects of all shapes and sizes. They could even be made to resemble full-sized canvas paintings, and indeed Arthur Gilbert himself mistook his very first micromosaic for a painting. When he brought it home to show his wife, he had to convince her that it was not in fact a cracked painting, as she supposed, but a mosaic.",
