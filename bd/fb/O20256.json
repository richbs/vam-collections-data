            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nThis frame was originally one of a larger set made to complement a specific architectural interior. The idea of framing a series of paintings as a set was developed in the reign of Charles II (1660-1685). At that period, the frames were designed by the carver, but later, during the reign of William and Mary (1689-1702), they often followed the architectural features of the rooms in which they would hang.\n\nPeople\nThis frame was made for Ralph, 1st Duke of Montagu (1637-1709), as part of a huge set for the paintings and mirrors at Montagu House, London. Montagu had served as Charles II's ambassador in Paris. On his return, he patronised many Huguenot refugee craftsmen in the decoration of his grand house, including the Pelletier brothers. Much of the Pelletier work is now at Boughton House, Northamptonshire.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe combination of strapwork and floral ornament on the outer moulding is similar to published designs for picture frames by the Huguenot designer Daniel Marot.\n\nMaterials & Making\nLike many of the Pelletier frames for Montagu House, this one retains its original water gilding. In this type of gilding, the base coat, a reddish clay known as 'bole', is moistened with water before the gold leaf is applied. When the work is dry the gold is burnished with a special tool until it is bright and shiny.",
