This medium is more durable than paper. Although these portraits were called 'plumbagos', meaning black lead, they were usually drawn in graphite and sometimes in ink. This portrait is done in graphite.\n\n\u2018Plumbagos' developed in the Netherlands in the late 16th century within the print trade. They developed from the printmakers\u2019 original drawings on paper, from which a print would have been engraved. 'Plumbagos' were introduced into England when the monarchy was restored in 1660, by printmakers who returned home from exile abroad. As the taste for 'plumbagos' became established, artists who were not printmakers also began to produce them.\n\nA few artists continued the art of the 'plumbago' into the early 18th century. Lewis Pingo was born in 1743. He was the son of Thomas Pingo (1692\u20131776), an Italian medallist and die engraver who settled in London in the 1740s. Lewis also worked as a medallist. Between 1756 and 1764 he won many prizes from the Society of Arts in London, for drawings, medallions, ornamental designs and for his die and gem engraving. In 1776 he succeeded his father as Assistant Engraver at the Royal Mint in London. He became Chief Engraver there following the death of Richard Yeo (1779), and retired in 1815.",
