The salver must have been made for a special occasion and was never claimed.\nInscribed and engraved on the back RUNDELL BRIDGE ET RUNDELL AURIFICES REGIS LONDINI and with the arms of Joseph Neeld.\n\nElaborate salvers such as this were intended for display on a buffet or sideboard, rather than use on the table. The central design of St George and the dragon was probably provided by Benedetto Pistrucci, an Italian gem-engraver and medallist, who is known to have worked for Rundells. He engraved the subject of St George for the reverse of the new gold coinage in 1817. The frieze around the rim, based on the Parthenon sculptures, was probably drawn from a stock design in the workshops. Such mixing of design sources was common 19th-century practice, particularly in firms of the size of Rundells, which had its own design studios and a large turn-over of plate.\n\nThe salver must have been made for a client, but never paid for, since it was bequeathed to Joseph Neeld, Philip Rundell's great nephew. Despite being senior partner in the firm, and worth a reputed \u00a31,250,000 on his death, Rundell was a notorious miser. It is most unlikely that he commissioned the salver himself.\n\nClassical Ideal Exhibition RF.2009/1012",
