The Museum had been set up on the South Kensington site in 1857 and was called the South Kensington Museum. In 1899 the foundation stone for the new building was laid by Queen Victoria. She wanted to rename the institution The Albert Museum, in recognition of her dead husband, Prince Albert, who had inaugurated the original, but was persuaded to add her name, hence the Victoria & Albert Museum. The architect of the new building was Sir Aston Webb (1849-1930). Brangwyn's print shows construction in progress. Brangwyn took a great interest in the V&A, and in 1909, the year the building was completed, offered to paint a mural in the Octagon Court for free. The offer was refused because it was felt that a museum should provide a neutral background for the exhibits it displays.",
