She combined traditional precious metals with pebbles, shells and bones used for their shapes and tactile qualities. Her work challenged the association of jewellery with wealth. When invited to take part in the 1975 exhibition \"Jewellery in Europe\", she explained that 'Compared to its creative quality, the whole concept of money making jewellery today is a contradiction and for me of total unimportance'. \n\nShe was born in Germany in 1936 and came to England in 1957. She studied at the Leeds College of Arts and then at the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London. She concentrated originally on painting and printmaking, but became an influential figure in the British contemporary jewellery scene in the 1960s and worked until her death from cancer in 1985.",
