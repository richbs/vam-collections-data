            "public_access_description": "Lawrence Cheung is design consultancy created by Alan Cheung and Geoffrey Lawrence in 1993. Working predominantly for public sector and non-profit clients, the organisation creates corporate identities, brochures and a variety of other materials including posters, conference and exhibition packages, signage, invitations and tickets - aswell as specialising in typography. \n\nEvery year since 1988 Lawrence Cheung has produced a limited edition Chinese New Year's greeting for its clients and friends. Since 1999 these greetings have taken the form of a scroll inspired by Escher's metamorphoses. In this card form 2000 a group of rabbits morphs into a dragon as the year of the rabbit gives way to the year of the dragon.\n\nThe Chinese animal signs are a 12-year cycle used for dating the years. They represent a cyclical concept of time, rather than the Western linear concept. The Chinese Lunar Calendar is based on the cycles of the moon and is constructed differently to the Western solar calendar. In the Chinese calendar, the beginning of the year falls somewhere between late January and early February. The Chinese have adopted the Western calendar since 1911, but the lunar calendar is still used for festive occasions such as the Chinese New Year.",
