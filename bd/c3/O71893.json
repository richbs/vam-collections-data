He had been a sleeping partner since 1850 in a firm of military tailors, Rogers, John Jones Ltd, at 33 Bruton Street, London. As Jones died on 7 January 1882, this bust is almost certainly a posthumous commemorative portrait.\n\nThe bust and pedestal were originally at the premises of Rogers, John Jones Ltd. The vendor of the bust had been employed by the firm, and believed that it had been in the company's possession since 1882. The Museum used to own a plaster version of the bust (Mus. no. 12-1900), but this was sold to the present firm of Rogers, John Jones Ltd, 16 Clifford Street, London, in 1971.\n\nJohn Lawlor initially studied at the Royal Dublin Society Schools; in 1845 he travelled to England and attended the Royal Academy Schools. His best known work is the group representing \"Mechanics\" which he executed in 1864 for the Albert Memorial. He travelled to America in 1886, returning to London in 1901.",
