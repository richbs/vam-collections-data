His successor, Kharak Singh, began construction of a samadh or funerary monument to commemorate him on 7 August in the capital at Lahore, on a site north of Hazuri Bagh near Lahore Fort. After Ranjit Singh's death the kingdom was plagued by rivalry among his successors. The state was annexed in 1849 by the British, and they later completed the monument.\n\nArchitectural models were made in many parts of India during the 19th century as souvenirs or records of famous buildings, often commissioned by British residents in India during their stay on the subcontinent.  The very large and detailed model of the Maharaja Ranjit Singh's samadh came into the collections of the East India Company's Museum in London. It was displayed imposingly there in the first gallery of the 'New Museum', rooms which opened in 1858. Then in 1879 it was transferred with thousands of other objects from the India Museum to South Kensington, the future V&A.\n\nAt that time fires were a common hazard and difficult to control. In the 1880s a fire raged through the annex destroying most of the model. Some of the surviving parts were subsequently transferred to the National Museum of Ireland and the Royal Museum of Scotland. Twelve fragments of the model were all that remained in the Victoria and Albert Museum's collection.",
