The complete outfit consisted of a pale green wool two-piece suit, the shirt and a wool bow tie by Chris Ruocco Tailors; a satin handkerchief, leather and elastic braces, and leather shoes. It reflected a style of dress worn by young black and Hispanic men in early 1940s America.\n\n\u2018Zoot\u2019 meant something worn or performed in an extravagant style, and since many young black and Hispanic men wore suits with outrageously padded shoulders and trousers sharply tapered at the ankles, the term \u2018zoot suit\u2019 passed into everyday usage. At a time when black Americans were expected to assume a subservient attitude to whites, the ostentatious zoot suit was a direct challenge to the social order. Its extravagant use of fabric also made wearers unpopular in wartime America. \n\nThe outfit was based upon the colourful and flamboyant suits worn by Cab Calloway in the 1943 film \u2018Stormy Weather\u2019.",

Unable to find an original zoot suit, this replica was commissioned. It was based upon the colourful and flamboyant suits worn by Cab Calloway in the 1943 film \u2018Stormy Weather\u2019.
