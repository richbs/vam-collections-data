London: Published by Trustees of the Victoria and Albert Museum, 1987.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n\"Copy after Robert DIGHTON (1752-1814)\nKeep Within Compass, 1786 (BM S 6903)\nLettered with the title and <i>Keep Within Compass And You Shall Be Sure, To Avoid Many Troubles Which Others Endure/ Fear God/ Industry Produceth Wealth\n</i>Etching and engraving coloured by hand\n23.2 X 16.5cm\nE.4898-1960\nGiven by the Executors of Mr. H. Clifford Smith.\n\nBM S= British Museum <i>Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires,</i> London, 1870-1954.\n\nThe abiding popularity of this print's theme, dealt with so skilfully by Hogarth in a number of his engravings is further demonstrated by the fact that this print was copied from a mezzotint by Robert Dighton and was itself copied in reverse and in reduced form in another print in the V&amp;A's collection, E.55-1971.  The comparison of the two prints from separate sources shows that the pirating of the above print involved copying the hand-colouring as well as the design.  Both are crudely coloured in the same five colours.\nThis type of print, in which the subject matter rather than the artist is of chief interest, probably sold cheaply, and, although the publisher might wish to make his goods more attractive by having them hand-coloured, he would wish to keep his costs down by paying the colourist as little as possible on piece work, hence the slapdash application of a narrow range of colours.\" \n",
