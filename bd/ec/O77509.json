Such sets are known as 'cabarets' in Britain, where they were usually for one or two people, and as d\u00e9jeuners in France. Eighteenth-century accounts of tea drinking in France indicate that the tea was made very strong in a small pot, and then diluted with hot water before being drunk. It is unlikely, however, that these pieces were ever used by Horace Walpole, their first owner, as for anything other than display.\n\nPeople\nThe service was bought by the writer, designer and collector Horace Walpole in Paris in 1765-6. In 1784 it was in the Great North Bedchamber of his gothic villa at Strawberry Hill, near Twickenham. At Strawberry Hill Walpole combined modern French porcelain with older ceramics collected for their antiquarian interest.\n\n Trading\nWalpole purchased these pieces some years after they were made, so probably bought them from the stock of a Paris dealer, rather than as new pieces from the factory. Continental porcelain could not be legally imported to Britain until 1775 unless it was declared to be for private use. Much French and German porcelain was illegally imported for sale in this way.",
