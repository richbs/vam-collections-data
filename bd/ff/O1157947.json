In the distance is the house where she worked.\n\nThis is the third of four prints William Hogarth made about the life and death of Tom Nero, exploring the issue of human cruelty both to humans and to animals.",

Woodcut. 45.2 x 37.6.</b> \nThis print had a reforming purpose. Hogarth said that it required 'neither great correctness of drawing or fine engraving', as these would have 'set the price of them out of the reach of those for whome [<i>sic</i>] they were chiefly intended'. The coarseness of the etched line gives it almost the appearance of woodcut. Although Hogarth had the skill and technical resources to produce this image himself (see fig. 6), he chose to have it cut on wood, the medium of the broadside with which the working classes were most acquainted. \n\n<b>6.</b> (opposite above) <b>William Hogarth (1697-1764), <i>Cruelty in Perfection</i>. Plate from <i>The Four Stages of Cruelty</i>, 1751. Etching. 38.8 x 32.1.</b> \nHogarth also issued this subject etched by himself. The lines are finer than those in the woodcut but considerably coarser than those in the print reproduced below (fig. 7 [F.118(21)]). The etched version was printed in two grades of paper and sold for one shilling the coarser, and sixpence extra the finer, in order to make it accessible to as large an audience as possible.'",
