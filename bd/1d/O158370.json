It is made of watered steel, and its hilt is overlaid with gold. The chiselled elephant-head on both sides of the blade at the forte is overlaid with gold on a cross-hatched ground to indicate trappings. There are traces of gold overlay on the baluster-shaped grips of the hilt, and residual sheet silver on the sides. The style of the elephant head relates to depictions of elephants in Mughal paintings of about 1650, and the dagger was presumably made in one of the weapon manufacturing centres of the Mughal empire at about this time.",

The painting forms the left half  of what must originally have been a double page composition depicting the reception of a foreign embassy at the Mughal court, perhaps made to illustrate a history of Shah Jahan's reign. Only the head of the elephant head is included, as is the case with the dagger, and its trunk curls in a precisely similar way. This association with an imperial painting, together with its high quality, suggests that the dagger was produced in a Mughal court workshop.",
