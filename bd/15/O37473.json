The heads have been carved and painted and other wood stained.  Each figure consists of a torso, hollowed out to take the spike for the head.  Attached to the shoulders by knotted rope are the arms, which are divided at the elbows and the two halves attached in the same way.  The lower arms, painted pink, are carved to form the hands which turn out almost at right angles; attached by knotted ropes to each hand are the control rods.  Each figure is dressed in a jacket and long skirt of cotton, batik dyed in soft brick red, cream and deep green.  The jacket is bound with brown cotton and nailed to the torso at the front; the skirt are gathered around the waist line.  The spikes on which the heads sit are also the control rods for the heads and bodies.  They are approximately 34cm long; half the length forms the spike and the red broad and flat at the middle taper to the lower end.  At the middle is a shallow groove for the operator's thumb.  The tapered end fits into a hole is a small round stand to hold the puppets when they are not in use.\n1.  male figure, head, carved and painted to show the facial features, ears and black hair; over the hair is a patterned headdress painted brown, green and black on beige.\n2.  spike and body rod to hold the male head\n3.  torso of the male figure\n4.  female figure, head, carved and painted to show the facial features, part of the ears and the hair which is black with a gold tiara.
