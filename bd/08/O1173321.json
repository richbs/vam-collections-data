            "public_access_description": "The Fillmore in San Francisco is a historic music venue, named after its original location at the intersection of Fillmore Street and Geary Boulevard. Known as the Fillmore Auditorium in the mid-1960s, concert promoter Bill Graham began a series of concerts featuring bands from the counterculture of the time. In 1968, due to his spiralling success, he moved to a larger venue which he named Fillmore West. Having closed in 1971, and after extensive repair work to fix earthquake damage, Graham's venue was revived when Live Nation reopened the original Fillmore venue in 1994.\n\nSan Francisco in the mid-1960s was the hub of the LSD and Hippie scene and the cultural and political rebellion of 1967's Summer of Love. The resulting influence of these factors on the artists of the area created the fantastic psychedelic posters of the Fillmore. Art dealer Jacaeber Kastor said of the posters, \"They couldn't just tell you the information about the show. They had to tell you what kind of people you might meet, what kind of far out trip you might have or perhaps even reveal the mysteries of the universe. Wow. Quantum mechanics, visual mudwrestling, Acid test pop quiz on a phone pole!\"\n\nThe poster was designed by Rick Griffin. Griffin spent his youth in South West USA, surfing and cartooning. His first job was as a staff artist for Surfer Magazine, and he created album graphics for surf musicians such as Dick Dale. He settled in San Francisco in 1966, where he created poster art for the Human Be-In, the hippie happening in Golden Gate Park that spawned the Summer of Love. He took his influences from American advertising and counter culture, using symbolic emblems such as flaming eyeballs, Indian braves, bleeding hearts and skulls.\n\nThis gig was headlined by Albert King, a blues guitarist and singer who had hits in the 1950s and 60s. Creedence Clearwater Revival were also on the bill. Although they were from San Francisco, Creedence's sound combined rock and roll with southern rock styles, also known as swamp rock.",
