The brooches are made of silver and would have been attached to a woman's robe with the pin and ring device at the top of each brooch. The piece is decorated with brightly coloured enamelled filigree and set with corals. Coral was believed to contain baraka (good luck) and to protect children and communities from evil.\n\nThis brooch was probably made by a Jewish silversmith as the Berbers thought working with metal was an inferior occupation. The filigree and enamelling  techniques used here ware introduced to North Africa in the late fifteenth century by Jewish immigrants fleeing persecution in Europe.  Jewish silversmiths dominated jewellery making in North Africa until the late nineteenth century.",
