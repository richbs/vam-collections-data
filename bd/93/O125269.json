His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nMessel created costumes and sets inspired by late 19th-century French art for Dodie Smith\u2019s play, Letter from Paris (1952).  Adapted from Henry James\u2019s novel, The Reverberator, (1908) the play explores the clash between American and aristocratic European values in late 19th-century Paris.  The production received a lukewarm reaction from critics and ran for only three weeks.\n\nMessel\u2019s costume design for Charles Waterlow, a cultured and intellectual artist and friend of Gaston Probert who is charmed by Francie Dosson.   The inscription on the design indicates that a portrait of the late nineteenth century French artist \u00c9douard Manet inspired the design.",

It  was directed by Peter Glenville with music by Ronald Emanuel and featured Brenda Bruce as Francis Dosson and Nicholas Phipps as Charles Waterlow.  \nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's theatre designs and other designs and artefacts.  The designs were briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being housed at the V&A from 1981 on indefinite loan.  The V&A Theatre Museum purchased the Oliver Messel collection from Lord Snowdon in 2005.",
