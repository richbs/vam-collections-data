This cup and cover is in pentagonal shape with eccentric turned mouldings. The stem is an open spiral coil. Inside the cup is the inscription; 'Princeps F. MDCLXXXI'. It was turned by the Medici Prince (the son of Grand Duke Cosimo III) under the tutelage of Philip Senger(Filippo Sengher; active in Florence 1675-1704), who was the court-turner of ivory for the Medici Court in Florence. A turned ivory box and lid in the Museo degli Argenti, Florence, similarly signed and dated 1678 testifies to the Prince's early proficiency in his hobby. \nThis piece is an example of the 'extraordinary passion for the lathe turning' in princely households, the product of a 'princeps artifex' (MacGregor 2007, p. 43).",
