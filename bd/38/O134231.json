Studied at Sass's Academy from 1835; entered RA Schools. In a long, prolific, and highly successful career, exhibited 107 works at the RA between 1840 and 1906, 13 at the BI 1838-1857, and 12 at the Society of British Artists 1838-1883. Subjects predominantly literary, historical, and - most notably - scenes of contemporary life, with which he achieved his greatest popular fame, amplified by many engraved reproductions, beginning with <i>Ramsgate Sands</i> (exh RA 1854 and bought by Queen Victoria). In 1875 his <i>Dinner at Boswell's</i> ... of 1869 sold at Christie's for \u00a34567, the highest price ever achieved by a living artist. Member of 'The Clique' in the 1840s; elected ARA 1845, RA 1852. Died Sr John's Wood, London, 2 November 1909; there had been a studio sale at Christie's 14 June 1884. The <i>Art Journal</i> obituarist wrote: 'the artist will be missed: he was an institution'. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1856, pp237-40 (for other references to Frith in the <i>Art Union</i> and <i>Art Journal</i>, see the entry in C Wood <i>Dictionary of Victorian Painters</i> 1971); W P Frith <i>My Autobiography and Reminiscences</i> 3 vols 1887-8; <i>Times</i> 4 November 1909 (obit); <i>Art Journal</i>191O, p14 (obit); Mrs J Panton <i>Leaves from a Life</i> 1909, <i>More Leaves from a Life</i> 1911; W P <i>Frith</i> Whitechapel Art Gallery exhibition catalogue 1951; N Wallis <i>A Victorian Canvas</i> 1957; J Mass <i>Gambart: Prince of the Victorian art world</i> 1975; A Noakes <i>William Frith: Extraordinary Victorian Painter</i> 1978. \n\n<b>Sancho Panza Tells a Tale to the Duke and Duchess</b> \n513-1882 \nPanel, 20.3 x 33 cm (8 x 13 ins) \nSigned and dated 'W P Frith 1850' br \nJones Bequest 1882 \n\nA sketch for (or possibly a replica of) the painting commissioned by the merchant banker Frederick Huth and exhibited at the RA in 1850 (not, as the <i>Autoiography</i> incorrectly states, in 1849). Unusually, no other version of this subject by Frith seems to be recorded, so the present work is probably the sketch shown to Huth as referred to below. The present whereabouts of the RA picture are unknown; for its early history see under <i>Prov</i>: below. \n\nThe RA catalogue gives the title and accompanying quotation as follows: \n\nSancho tells a tale to the Duke and Duchess, to prove that Don Quixote is at the bottom of the table: 'Then thus, (quoth Sancho,) both of them being ready to sit down, the husbandman contended with the gentleman not to sit uppermost, and he with the other that he should, as meaning to command in his own house; but the husbandman, presuming to be mannerly and courteous, never would, till the gentleman, very moody, laying hands upon him, made him sit down perforce, saying \"Sit down, you thresher; for wheresoe'er I sit, that shall be the table's end to thee\". And now you have my tale; and, truly, I believe it was brought in here pretty well to the purpose. Don Quixote's face was in a thousand colours, that jaspered on his brow'. \n\nThe quotation is from chapter 31 of the second part of Cervantes' satirical romance <i>Don Quixote</i> published 1605-15. \n\nFrith wrote of the commission: \n\nIt is always agreeable to be able to note instances of liberality, as well as intelligent critical supervision, during the execution of a work; and in my commission from Mr Huth I experienced both. When I produced my sketch my employer asked me to name a price for the picture that would be satisfactory to me, and on my hesitating he named one himself, much in excess of what I should have demanded. \n\nHe continued: \n\nI think I succeeded in some respects very well in my 'Quixote' picture; the Sancho and the Chaplain being thought successful, the Don less so, from the extreme - almost insurmountable - difficulty of giving to his figure the dignity that his appearance, the lank jaw and attenuated form, are so apt to destroy; and it is only in such hands as [C R] Leslie's that the difficulty disappears. On the whole, my reputation was advanced... \n\nThe <i>Athenaeum</i> critic found the RA painting 'of great beauty in colour', \nwhile the <i>Art Journal</i> thought 'the definite variety and appropriate felicity of character in this picture are evidently a result of assiduous study and research ... The colour and texture are of great excellence; on the whole, there are few more admirable pictures in the Exhibition'. \n\nFrith exhibited one other Don Quixote subject, 'Altsidora, Pretending Love for Don Quixote, Feigns a Swoon at the Sight of Him' at the RA in 1869. \n\nPROV: (RA picture) commissioned by Frederick Huth, exhibited at the RA 1850 (332), still in his family collection 1887; sold Christie's (C F Huth sale) 6 July 1895 (82) 85.1 x 115.6 cm (33\u00bd x 45\u00bd ins), signed and dated 1850), bought Vokins \u00a3252 \n\nENGR: (RA picture) J and G P Nicholls in <i>Art Journal</i> 1856, p239 \n\nLIT: (RA picture) <i>Athenaeum</i> 25 May 1850, p559; <i>Art Journal</i> 1850, pl7l, 1856, p240; <i>Autobiography</i> I, pp196-8; E B Chancellor <i>Walks among London's Pictures</i> 1910, p244\"",
