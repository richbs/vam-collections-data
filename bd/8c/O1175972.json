A ban on Christmas cards to conserve supplies of paper was mooted during the First World War but the idea was abandoned in the interests of maintaining the troops' morale. The cartoons of Captain Bruce Bairnsfather (who had been injured at Ypres) were published in the popular tabloid magazine The Bystander and were enormously popular with the troops for their satirical unromantic view of life in the trenches. In 1916 The Bystander published a collection of the cartoons in a book, Fragments from France, which was hugely successful, selling out in several editions and running to a series of sequels. Many of the cartoons were also published for sale as prints and postcards. \"There goes our blinkin' parapet again\" is from the first book in the series.",
