She made her first appearance on the London stage at the New Royalty Theatre in 1863 in a burletta called The Pirates of Putney and made her name at the Roylty Theatre in 1869 as the original Mrs. Pinchbeck in T.W. Robertson's play Home.  She became one of London's most popular leading ladies in the 1870s, managed the Olympic Theatre for a year from September 1872 and appeared on Broadway in 1878 and toured to San Francisco, Chicago and St. Louis as Rosalind, Juliet and Lady Teazle.",
