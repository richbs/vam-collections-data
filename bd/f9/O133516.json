The later works have a soft palette and dream-like quality to them, whereas this poster, with its bold graphics and strong use of colour is much more lively. \n\nBonnard's father, a public servant, had wanted his son to study the law; Bonnard dutifully trained as a barrister and was admitted to the bar at the age of 21. Nevertheless, Bonnard also indulged his aspirations to be a painter and enrolled as a student at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian in Paris and it was here that he would meet the fellow artists with whom he would form the symbolist group that was to have a lasting impression on his life's work: Les Nabis.",
