            "physical_description": "1. horse is of moulded plastic; reddish brown with black trim. Under each foot is a small brass wheel. The key bar protrudes from the left shoulder of the body which houses the clockwork mechanism. Around the middle of the body is a band of black and white plastic saddle shape\ncovering the open allowing the movement of the horse. At the top of the saddle is a small red bar into which hooks the rider. When wound the horse's body opens and narrows at the middle forcing the back legs to appear to kick; this forces the horse along on its wheels. \n2. rider; representing a cowgirl; has a wire frame. The torso is covered with red fabric which matches the hat. Around the neck is a yellow vinyl kerchief and a matching belt at the waist. The trousers are white vinyl; outer edges are pinked; and the feet are made from white and brown felt. The head is a painted cloth face mask (in the style of the 1930s) with\nyellow floss hair styled into a bun at the back. The figure holds the reins in its right hand. Between the legs is a small metal hook which fits into the top of the saddle to hold the doll on the horse. \n3. box; card printed in colour to show the title; maker's name; and an illustration of a jumper and jockey on one side and a cowboy on a white horse on the other. On one edge is a stable door pattern marked SCUDERIA; Stables; and ESPER; probably the horse's name. \n*Printed along the bottom edge of one side: Made in Italy Brevettato in Italia Brevete Germany.France.Italy Patent Applied For in USA.Canada Great Britain.Schweiz.Belgique \n4. winding key; marked Quercetti \n5. cellophane bag printed in red with Quercetti; to house the rider \n6. cellophane bag printed in red with Quercetti; to house the key",
