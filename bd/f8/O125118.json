He later settled in London, and became a member of the stock exchange.  His interest in railways led to his election as an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1839, and he was director or chairman of two railway companies between 1843 and 1848.  Much of his time however was spent collecting pictures and works of art.  In his will he offered his collection of mostly German and Dutch schools to the National Gallery (which selected only three works) and to the Department of Science and Art at South Kensington, later the Victoria and Albert Museum.  The South Kensington Museum acquired ninety-two oil paintings and forty-seven watercolours.  A number of engravings were also left to the British Museum.",

James Nasmyth wrote that for his brother Patrick, \u2018The immediate neighbourhood of London abounded with the most charming and appropriate subjects for his pencil. These consisted of rural \u201cbits\u201d of the most picturesque but homely description \u2013 the decayed pollard trees and old moss-grown orchards, combined with cottages and farm-houses in the most \u201cpaintable\u201d state of decay, with tangled hedges and neglected fences, overrun with vegetation clinging to them with all the careless grace of nature\u2019 (Peter Johnson and Ernle Money, <i>The Nasmyth Family of Painters</i>, 1977, p.31). This painting exemplifies the naturalism observed by Nasmyth\u2019s brother, while also reflecting Nasmyth\u2019s absorption of 17th-century, Dutch landscape painting, particularly the work of Jacob van Ruisdael (1628/9-82) and Meindert Hobbema (1638-1709).",
