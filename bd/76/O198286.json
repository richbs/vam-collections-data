The replacement softwood drawer divider perhaps at least suggests that the drawers were not entirely reconstructed shortly before acquisition.\n\nIt is possible that neither drawer was fitted with a lock, suggesting that they were concealed, but as the desk was evidently meant to be portable, the drawers would have fallen open if not secured, and there is now no evidence of a concealed catch. As the sloping top is not hinged, it is fairly obvious that it must incorporate at least one drawer, so concealed drawers would not have been a very effective security device on this piece.\n\nThe relatively simple construction and the quality of the figural motifs suggests that this piece was not of the highest quality.",

            "historical_context_note": "During the 15th century a well-appointed study would have contained a built-in desk unit. Around 1500 a new type of portable writing-desk that could be placed on any available table, became popular. It was of Spanish-Moorish origin, and consisted of a shallow desk with sloping lid for writing on (or resting a text for reading), which contained drawers and compartments for pens, inks, papers and seals. Its size and smooth bottom meant that it was ideal for travellers. Only very grand ones are fitted with feet, which would have been impractical for most travellers. It is clear from Erasmus' fundamental Latin handbook of manners and civility for schoolchildren that the contents of such desks were not just personal, but private. Renaissance images of scholars and ecclesiastics often show them in the act of writing at a sloping writing-desk. Most 16th and 17th century desks were probably neat but plain, while those that have survived tend to be elaborately decorated with veneers inlay or carving.\n\nAdapted  from Dora Thornton, The Scholar in his study",
