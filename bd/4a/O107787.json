They were made in the technique n\u00e5lbindning, sometimes called knotless netting or single needle knitting -  a technique closer to sewing than knitting. These socks were made using three-ply wool.\nSome believe that this technique was a forerunner of the faster method of knitting with two or more needles.",

He was executor of the estate of the late Major Myers and these items were selected among others from a list of textiles as 'a large number of very useful examples'.

            "historical_context_note": "<i>Technique</i> \nBoth <i>n\u00e5lbindning</i> and knitting produce a texture composed of elastic rows of stitches made out of a single thread. Its elasticity facilitates a close-fit for hands, feet and head. Fit is of particular importance in a cold climate but also for protecting feet clothed in sandals only. <i>N\u00e5lbindning</i> is much more time-consuming than knitting and requires great nimbleness of the left-hand fingers - an extension of a basic basketry or netting technique, which in its simplest form is a single loop worked through a single loop, and is akin to sewing. This technique is linked with home production for personal use, but is highly skilled.  The disadvantage with <i>n\u00e5lbindning</i> is that only a limited length of yarn (a needleful) can be worked, another length  has to be joined - in knitting a thread of indefinite length is used. \n\nThe technique <i>n\u00e5lbindning</i> is without doubt older than knitting, used widely since prehistoric times. The needles used are flat, blunt and between 6 -10 cm long, relatively large-eyed at one end or the eye is near the middle. They are usually made of bone or wood. The mass demand for elastic items of clothing displaced <i>n\u00e5lbindning</i> by the much faster and more economical knitting, between AD 500 and 1200. However, the technique survived  in many rural areas for hard-wearing garments till at least the 19th century (for example, in Scandinavia).\n\nThe origins of 'true' knitting might be found in the material from the territory of the Roman Empire, and it is thought that the earliest pieces knitted with two needles were found in Holland and date to the end of the second century AD. So far the earliest knitting is considered to come from Islamic Egypt - 11th century. It is possible that knitting was introduced to Europe from Asia through trade routes to Venice or as a result of the Moorish invasion of Spain (711-712 AD).\n\n<i>Shape</i> \nThe big toe divided from the others suggest that the socks were probably meant to be worn with sandals. It is unclear whether the socks formed offerings to the dead or were used as foot coverings. Note that the holes have not laddered (though they have spread somewhat). This effect is typical of knitting when the wool breaks, but not of <i>n\u00e5lbindning</i>.",
