Lacking any portrait miniature from which to copy a likeness, the carver of this ivory statuette (who was probably working in Delhi, a major centre of the craft), gave the maharaja the majestic appearance and jewellery of a Mughal emperor. In reality Ranjit Singh was renowned for his simple dress and plain features, bearing the ravages of childhood smallpox, which had permanently scarred his skin. It also left him blind in one eye, a detail that the carver has incorporated. The statuette is similar to a \u2018portrait\u2019 of the maharaja in an illustrated copy of the \u2018Tazkirat ul-\u2019umara\u2019 (\u2018Historical notices of princely families [of Rajasthan and the Punjab\u2019]) by Colonel James Skinner of about 1830, suggesting that the carver used this as his model.",
