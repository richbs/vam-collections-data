Renowned even in the medieval period for its woodwork, Abadah in the nineteenth century was most famous for its elaborately carved sherbet spoons (qashuq) made of pear- and box-wood. \n\nThe spoons were made in a variety of shapes and sizes. The largest and most impressive spoons were used for drinking sherbet, while slightly smaller ones were used for soup and rice and the smallest type was used for pickles. Large spoons were usually made in two parts, with a long rhomboid handle joined to the bowl-section by a socket. The socket was concealed under a large rosette to make it appear as if the spoon had been carved from one large piece of wood. Large spoons also had a curved 'buttress' underneath the rosette which braced against the bowl, adding stability and preventing the spoon from breaking under the weight of its load of sherbet. \n\nExquisitely carved spoons were the preserve of the well-to-do. They featured prominently at fancy dinner gatherings, where they were the only utensils used. The spoons were placed in ceramic basins full of sherbet with their handles balanced on the side and their bowls floating atop the sherbet. A guest would drink from the spoon, then place it back in the basin for the use of the other guests. One spoon might serve for two or three people in this way.",
