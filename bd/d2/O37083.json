The nose and mouth are of black stitches and the eyes of brown and black plastic.  The upper body and arms are of red felt designed to represent a hunting jacket with a single white button at the front (this is a replacement).  The front chest is yellow felt representing a waistcoat.  The hands are double thickness white felt stitched to indicate fingers and separate thumbs.  The legs are of purple and white printed rayon, shaped and stuffed to represent riding britches with the lower part and feet of green felt.  At the top of the green felt, below the knee line,is a band of red felt.  The bases of the feet are lined with a sheet of card.\n2.  neck tie, a length of white satin ribbon tied around the neck in a bow.\n\n*From the use of the mohair fur fabric and the rayon, this is likely to have been made before 1939 when the company converted to producing war equipment.  However, the use of the plastic eyes may indicate a later date of post 1947 to about 1952.",
