Politically and economically advantageous alliances were meticulously negotiated and lavishly celebrated. This was only possible with extravagant spending and those who could afford it paid vast sums of money to fete the occasion. An elaborate courtship involved the exchange of many gifts particularly associated with, and often made especially for, the ritual. Therefore, art objects had a specific role in the practical business of arranging a marriage, translating tangible wealth in to signifiers of abstract virtue.\n\nLove was a major iconographic theme in the decoration of maiolica. Besides the amorous themes from myth and legend, there exist numerous plates painted with the idealised portrait of a woman, often accompanied by her name or an  inscription. In this instance, the female figure is depicted carrying the pierced heart in an expression of virtuous devotion, so important to Renaissance ideals. She stands between two symbols of fecundity and fruitfulness, which symbolise the hopes of the union. Fertility and chastity were both highly-valued qualities in women wishing to make a successful marriage.",

Besides the amorous themes from myth and legend, there exist numerous plates painted with the idealised portrait of a woman, often accompanied by her name or an  inscription. In this instance, the female figure is depicted carrying the pierced heart in an expression of virtuous devotion, so important to Renaissance ideals. She stands between two symbols of fecundity and fruitfulness, which symbolise the hopes of the union. Fertility and chastity were both highly-valued qualities in women wishing to make a successful marriage.",

Politically and economically advantageous alliances were meticulously negotiated and lavishly celebrated. This was only possible with extravagant spending and those who could afford it paid vast sums of money to fete the occasion. An elaborate courtship involved the exchange of many gifts particularly associated with, and often made especially for, the ritual. Therefore, art objects had a specific role in the practical business of arranging a marriage, translating tangible wealth in to signifiers of abstract virtue.",
