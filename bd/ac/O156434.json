            "public_access_description": "This cabinet, made by Robert Hume in London in 1824, is set with earlier mosaics made in Paris around 1650-1700 in the Gobelins workshops. The Manufacture des Gobelins was founded as a dye works in the mid-15th century by Jean Gobelin. In 1662, Louis XIV purchased the Gobelins manufactory and there Colbert united all the royal artisans, creating a royal tapestry and furniture works. The relief mosaic technique developed in Florence under the influence of Giovanni Battista Foggini spread to the French factory in France where Florentine mosaicists were active.\n\nIn the 19th century some of the products of the Gobelins workshop were dismantled and the complex mosaics reused on more modern furniture. Florentine craftsmen working at the Gobelins workshops in Paris made the six rectangular panels of flowers and birds in the late 17th century. Robert Hume later reset them when he designed this clock cabinet for Hamilton Palace, the Lanarkshire home of Alexander, 10th Duke of Hamilton.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world\u2019s great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",

Partridge, London, 1978.\n\nHistorical significance: Documents in the Hamilton archives indicate that the London cabinet maker Robert Hume procured mosaic items specifically for this clock cabinet which was under construction in 1822. The cabinet was completed on 16 December 1824.\n\nThe pietre dure on the clock face and its immediate outer border with its fruit motifs carved in deep relief and attached by gilt-bronze pins differs from the earlier pietre dure panels and was probably commissioned specifically for this cabinet in the 1820s.",

            "historical_context_note": "The six panels on the lower and upper cornices were made according to the relief technique developed in Florence under the influence of Giovanni Battista Foggini; this technique spread to the Gobelins factory in France when Florentine mosaicists went to work there. During the 18th century some of the products of the Gobelins workshops were dismantled and re-used. These six panels are clearly related to a series of mosaics illustrated on a design for a cabinet by Philippe Francois Julliot (1735-1835) which include the motif of a bird pecking at grapes.  Two similar mosaics are found on a pair of cabinets by Adam Weisweiler in the Swedish Royal Collection; others are on a pair of cabinets by the same cabinet maker in the Wallace Collection, London.",
