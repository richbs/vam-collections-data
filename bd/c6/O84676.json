Versions of this chair were used throughout the building, including upholstered models in the director's office and conference room. \n\nThe chair's general form recalls an armchair designed by Gustav Siegel and shown at the Paris 1900 Exhibition. Wagner's model, however, has more elegant feet. The 1907 Thonet catalogue listed the aluminium mounts as optional extras. It also offered the option of fine or coarse caning for upholstery, a chair covering often used for light-weight Thonet seat furniture.",
