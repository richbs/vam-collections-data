The drawing shows the Marquess in Roman armour with raised sword in his left hand, and an olive branch in his right. He served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland and was the first Governor General of India. This sculpture was one of Bacon's most important commissions. The marble figure was executed for the East India Company, and now stands in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London. It is interesting to note that a choice of drawings was made for presentation to the client. This design is the closer of the two to the finished sculpture. The alternative design for the sculpture is also at the V&A (Museum number E.424-2008). \n\nBacon began his career as a modeller in a porcelain factory, going on to design for the ceramic and metalwork industries. His career as a sculptor, however, took off when the Archbishop of York commissioned a bust of George III. His best known works are the monuments to Thomas Guy in Guy's Hospital, Pitt the Elder in Westminster Abbey, and Dr. Johnson at St. Paul's Cathedral.",
