Morris brought modern art into local schools and colleges.  He was in touch with many European artists and architects and through his assistance many were able to come to Britain to escape persecution in Hitler's Germany.  Extensive research by the Trust has failed to establish the identity of the artist.\n\nHistorical significance: This drawing is a stylish and evocative portrait of one of the 20th century's major choreographers.",
