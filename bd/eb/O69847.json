The image includes a poem by Steven Smith that echoes the new spirit of defiance against the brutalities of apartheid that was emerging at the time. Jantjes work at this time was overtly political.

Jantjes (born 1948)</b> \n\n<i>Freedom Hunters</i>, 1977 \n\nJantjes first came to Europe from South Africa on a German Academic Exchange Scholarship, studying in Hamburg from 1970 to 1972, then staying on as a political exile.  In 1976, working at the Poster Collective in London, he made a set of anti-racist screenprints to be used in schools.  He also exhibited at the ICA his suite of prints <i>South African Colouring Book</i> (1974-5), which used the metaphor of childhood pastime and educative toy to indicate the depth and cruelty of pro-apartheid indoctrination.  <i>Freedom Hunters</i> more specifically commemorates the infamous massacre of students in Soweto on 16 June 1976; the image, lettered with a poem by Steven Smith ('We'll evolve...As an epidemic of Black Freedom Hunters') echoes Nelson Mandela's own view on the new spirit of defiance developing at the time. \nFor his screenprints of the 1970s Jantjes used the photographic and collaging process developed by artists working with the printer Chris Prater; Jantjes had in fact studied with one of these artists, Joe Tilson, in Hamburg.  Overtly political in tone, his commentary directly mirrors the imagery of television and press reportage through which Britain came to know of events in South Africa. \nDeeply aware of his responsibilities, Jantjes placed his own very contemporary, media-orientated work firmly in a historical tradition; he wrote in 1978: \n<i>If the axiom of art for art's sake still applies to Western European art, it is certainly not applicable to African art.  I believe it never has been.  For African artistic expression, whether rock painting or bronze sculpture, workshops or was dances, never transcends either the physical or cosmic reality of the African people; African works of art appear meaningless seen in relation to Africa's cultural and historic reality.  It has always been art for life's sake.  The environment of today's Africa demands liberation from inhumanity.  Can the art of Africa ignore this demand?  Can it be anything else than art for liberation's sake?</i>\"",
