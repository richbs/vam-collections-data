Full Citation:\n\n\u201c<b>114 Unknown Man</b>\n<b>1663</b> \nEvans 39 \n\n<b>Oval 71 x 59mm</b> \n\nFeatures hatched, with a marked horizontal tendency, in brown and sanguine, blended with blue and grey in the shadows, white heightening in the eyes, all on a pale carnation ground; hair washed in pale brown, hatched and lined in darker colour, with the lights in pale brown and ochre gouache; the collar in grey wash worked over in white; the costume and armour in opaque washes of brown, ochre, grey and black, heightened with white and gold; background a sky and landscape in opaque washes of blue, grey, dark brown etc., hatched and stippled for the detail; on vellum put down on pasteboard. \n\n<b>Condition:</b> A small late addition filling out the oval to the right, the gouache constituted with zinc-white; otherwise excellent. \n\n<b>Signed:</b> In ink, on the back: M:S: Fecit/1663 (see A in Appendix 2). \n\n<b>Frame:</b> A rectangular frame, probably modern, of black veneer over oak; a complex bolection moulding with flat sides; the glass held in a rebate at the front; a gold painted inner slip frame with a bevelled oval cut out for the miniature; a gilded ring-headed screw hanger. \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> Alan Evans; by him bequeathed to the National Gallery, 1974; placed on indeterminate loan at the V&A. (See Appendix 3.) \n\n<b>Exhibited:</b> New Haven etc. 1981- 2, no. 57. \n\n<b>Literature:</b> Foskett 1979, p. 118, pl. 22a; <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 57; Murdoch 1981, p. 142, pl. 26c; Reynolds 1988, p. 72, fig. 39. \n\nThis miniature appears to have been acquired by Evans on his own account, possibly in substitution for a somewhat sombre and unsigned example of Snelling's hand which Wallop had owned and which had been one of the earliest objects lent by Wallop to the Museum in 192 7. Long therefore did not know of it. It is clearly a beautiful and accomplished work, which might have led him to improve his opinion of Snelling's abilities. (1)\n\nIn technique, and in the presentation of the figure against a bright sky background, the miniature suggests that Snelling, already by this date a limner of nearly twenty years standing, may have been a source for Flatman's early style.
