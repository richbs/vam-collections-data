The stylized fish that leaps from the blade to form the handle seems to move at such speed that detail is lost. The chased ripples of the blade and scalloped edges enhance the sense of movement, of a moment frozen in time. The flash of the action is captured in the glints of light that reflect off the undulating ripples. The piece is exquisitely proportioned, the tapered navette shape of the blade balanced by the handle. The smoothness of the ripples are beautifully offset by the delicate scale patterns of the fish. The handle ends with the delicate fish mouth as a novel finial, an original touch to this delightfully simple design.",
