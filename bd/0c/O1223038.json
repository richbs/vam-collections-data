This character was played by Mr. Topham and appeared in scene 1: 'The Region of Reverses in the Island of Ups and Downs'. The playbill credits: 'The Masks, Models and Physiognomical Devices, Designed and Executed by the celebrated Dykwynkyn'. In an article of 1867 the playwright T.W. Robertson described him as 'the presiding genius of all theatrical Christmas revels.'\n\nFor his pantomime work Keene used the name Dykwynkyn which he characteristically signed on an artist's palette on the ground. He was also responsible for designs for a number of other lavish productions of the day, and for these he was billed as Mr. R.W. Keene.",
