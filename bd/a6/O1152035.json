Here 'Design' is personified as a graceful winged figure ready to inscribe something on a tablet. Though this drawing seems to propose 'Design' as weightless, transcendent thought being giving solid form, Dyce's book itself became notorious for its prosaic, monotonous and mechanical drawing exercises.",
