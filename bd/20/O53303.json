            "public_access_description": "Kenton & Co. was founded in 1890 by a group of architects and designers including Ernest Gimson, the designer of this cabinet on stand. The furniture was made by a group of professional cabinet makers. The firm had a successful exhibition in London in 1891 but closed in 1892 because of financial difficulties and because the partners wanted to concentrate on other projects. This cabinet was bought at the exhibition by the architect and designer, Allan F. Vigers, and purchased by the Museum from his daughter.\n\nFollowing Arts and Crafts principles, the names of those individuals involved in each piece of furniture by Kenton & Co. were stamped in appropriate places. Gimson's initials and the name of the maker, A. Bowen, are stamped inside the cabinet with the firm's name. Many of the pieces by Kenton & Co. show the influence of earlier styles both in the design and in the decoration. Gimson used seventeenth-century furniture designs as sources for the cabinet and for the marquetry decoration.",
