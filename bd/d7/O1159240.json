Presided over by Andrew Lloyd-Webber and a panel of critics, viewers voted each week for their favourite Maria, with Lloyd Webber choosing which of the two singers who gained the fewest votes should stay in the contest.\n\nBox office receipts were exceptionally good for this musical, as for the previous show which had conducted a similar search for the title role of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Coat. The television programmes worked as extraordinarily effective advertisements for the musicals, whilst also helping audience members to make a difference as to who got to the next week's programme.",
