They originated in the 1440s with the desire to reproduce coins and hardstone engravings from ancient Greece and Rome. Some were made as collector\u2019s pieces, to be viewed and displayed in private, and others for practical purposes. They also inspired designs in other media, from architecture to bookbindings. The fashion for swords decorated with elaborate pommels was at its height around 1500. This shield-shaped plaquette was almost certainly designed for this purpose. Mucius Scaevola was a hero of Roman legend who thrust his hands into flames as proof of his courage. In the Renaissance period he represented patience and constancy.",
