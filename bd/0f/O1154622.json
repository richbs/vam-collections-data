Scrapbooks may be said to have their origins in the commonplace books popular with adults from at least the 16th century: these books contained a mixture of observations, recipes, poetry, letters etc, which might be printed or hand written, and the pages were sometimes also decorated with pictorial elements.\n\nScrap books for use by children became really popular from about the 1870s, when colour printing became more affordable and readily available. This meant that in addition to cutting illustrations from magazines and books, and pasting in souvenirs, the scrap book compiler could easily and quite cheaply buy colourful and professionally produced pictorial 'scraps' or 'reliefs' showing a wide variety of subjects. These had originated in Germany in the 1800s as printed decorations for confectionery, and began to be collected as souvenirs of various occasions. Among the more popular subjects for children were flowers, birds and animals, nursery rhyme figures and seasonal outdoor scenes such as children harvesting or skating.\n\nThe scrap book has had something of a revival in recent years, partly in connection with the availability of digital and computer-accessible images, and is often created in digital form.",

'Evie' was the youngest child, her siblings being Sebastian, Caroline, Henry, Ernest and Arthur. The donor writes \"I assume the reason the scrapbook was inherited by my late husband's branch of the Clarke family is because when 'Aunt Evie' married and travelled to India she gave the book to the elder daughter of her eldest brother, Sebastian Clarke. His daughter (1897-1985) was christened Agnes Mary but was always called Nessie. At the end of her life she lived in a retirement home for governesses which is still in Chislehurst. We had regular contact with her during these years and when she died we inherited some of her possessions.\"",
