The design was executed for a production of Donizetti's opera \"Lucia di Lammermoor\" which originally opened at the Netherlands Opera, Amsterdam, on September 11th 1970. The scenery for the production was designed by Henry Bardon.  The production was subsequently revived by Scottish Opera at the Theatre Royal, Newcastle on September 29th 1974.  The revival was directed by John Copley, conducted by Roderick Brydon, and Elizabeth Harwood appeared as in the title role.  The lighting was by Charles Bristow.  The production was revived again by Scottish Opera in 1975 and 1981.",
