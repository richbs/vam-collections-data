This design is annotated with the names of a number of different characters and actresses. Mrs Vale (Jane) was played by Eileen Carey in 1929. The costume may originally have been intended for the character of Harriet (Lady Edgar James), whose name has been crossed out, and may have been re-used for actress Winifred Talbot \n\nGladys Calthrop (1894-1980) was an English set and costume designer. Born Gladys Treeby in Devon, she married, and later separated from, Everard E. Calthrop. She met Noel Coward in Italy during 1921, they subsequently became friends and worked together on many plays. Their first collaboration was on The Vortex in 1924 for which Calthrop designed both sets and costumes. She worked in both London and New York.",
