            "public_access_description": "David Walker (1934-2008) studied design at the Central School of Art under Jeanetta Cochrane from whom he learned the importance of a thorough knowledge of historical dress. This sense of history can be seen in his meticulously conceived but hugely theatrical and imaginative recreation of clothes for plays and operas and of more fantastical dresses for ballet. He began his career principally as a costume designer, working at Theatre Workshop in 1960 and then at the Royal Court Theatre, the Royal Shakespeare Company and the Royal Ballet. He has become one of the world's leading designers, especially acclaimed as an opera and ballet designer, and has created productions for every major opera house and ballet company in the world. Walker's skill lies in adapting historic dress in theatrical terms, working in a highly imaginative way with fabrics and trimmings while remaining true to the period in which a production is set. His designs are as much works of art in their own right as they are guides to the costumiers.\n\nHandel's 1742 opera Semele is based on Greek myth.  Semele is the human lover of the god, Jupiter, who appears to her in mortal form. Juno, furious at her husband's infidelity, visits Semele is disguise and convinces the girl that she will gain immortality if she sees Jupiter as his true self, the mightly god of thunder.  Reluctantly, Jupiter agrees to her request and Semele perishes in flames.  \n\nThe Royal Opera House production in 1982 celebrated the 250th anniversary of the building of a theatre on the Covent Garden site.  It was the first time that Semele had been staged at Covent Garden since 1744, when it was given 'in the Manner of an Oratorio' at the  first Covent Garden Theatre.  The 1982 production was directed by John Copley and conducted by Charles Mackerras with sets by Henry Bardon and costumes by David Walker. Valerie Masterson sang Semele and Kathleen Kuhlmann Juno. Walker's designs are based on the 18th-century theatre's idea of classical dress.  His sumptuous design for Juno shows the goddess's imperious character as well as her costume. The purples, blues and greens are the colours of the peacock, traditional symbol of Juno.",
