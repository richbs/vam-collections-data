In a four-feet wide oval framed in gilded leaves is an eastern scene with two arab stallions, a grey and a chestnut, led by attendants through country with cactus and palm trees, a minaret and a dome topped by a crescent in the distance.\n\nTo either side of this scene, the ground is pink covered with a stylised flowering train in red. In front of this at each side is a large urn or incense burner, its base hidden by a large plant and flowers. More flowers are in the spandrels at the top of the oval, as are two tassels, blue at the left, and red at the right, attached to an outer scrolling edge of Moorish design.\n\nThis Crossley mosaic is stuck to a piece of printed warp, looped pile, carpeting with another design which has no repeat. Enormous flowers some 10-11 inches across smother a pierced cartouche in an architectural surround decorated with scrolls and lattice in rococo revival style.",
