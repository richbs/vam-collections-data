The statuette was commissioned from the sculptor by the Museum and is one of three versions made by Sir Eduardo Paolozzi and cast by the Arch Bronze Foundry in London in 1996.\n\nPaolozzi (1924-2005) was a British sculptor, collagist, printmaker, film maker and writer. Born of Italian parents, he attended Edinburgh College of Art in 1943. After a brief military service, in 1944 he attended St Martin\u2019s School of Art in London, and from 1945 to 1947 he studied sculpture at the Slade School of Fine Art. In 1947 he moved to Paris. He remained there until 1949, meeting artists such as Arp, Braque, Brancusi, Giacometti, Jean H\u00e9lion, L\u00e9ger and Tristan Tzara. He was attracted to Surrealist art and ideas and was also impressed by the art brut of Dubuffet. From 1949 to 1955 Paolozzi taught at the Central School of Art and Design in London. During the 1970s Paolozzi experimented with wood in a number of abstract relief works using an intricate network of geometric and biomorphic elements.\n\nElizabeth Esteve-Coll was appointed Keeper and Chief Librarian of the National Art Library from 1985, and was Director of the Museum from 1988 to 1995. The two reliefs on the pedestal of the figure were inspired by objects in the Museum's collections. The left-hand panel is an interpretation of the Descent from the Cross, a model in gilt, wax and wood by the 16th-century Italian architect and sculptor Jacopo Sansovino (Museum no. 7595-1861). The right-hand panel is inspired by the Burghley Nef, a nautilus shell (similar to mother-of-pearl) mounted in silver parcel gilt, dating from 1482-3 (Museum no. M.60-1959).\n\nThe Museum also has a maquette of the head and torso of this figure in plaster on a wooden base (Mus. no. A.2-2001) and a plaster maquette of the head (A.3-2001) together with a plaster maquette for the plinth and two for the base (Mus. no. A.6 to 8-2001). A plaster maquette for the complete figure is also in the collection (Mus. no. A.5-2001).",
