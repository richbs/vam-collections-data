It is of  the plaster model of the figure of 'The Shield of Faith' by the sculptor, James Redfern (1837-1876), in about 1865 to 1867 for the fl\u00e8che, or spire, of the Albert Memorial that was intended to be electroformed in copper but was not executed in this form. Instead a different figure of Faith, crowned, holding aloft a cross and a chalice, was electroformed and erected on the fl\u00e8che of the Albert Memorial, Hyde Park, London, completed in 1874, to commemorate Prince Albert. This albumen print functions as a design for Francis Skidmore (1817-1896)  for scaling up the plaster model to full size shown by the squaring up and the numbering of the resultant grid prior to electroforming the figure in copper which he was to undertake at his firm, Skidmore's Art Manufactures and Constructive Iron Company, at Alma Street,  Coventry. The figure was then to be gilded in situ on the Memorial.",
