            "physical_description": "Cassone with high-relief carved scenes from the stories of Apollo and Phaeton, divided by caryatid term figures, centred on a shield supported by two putti. On lion feet.\n\nThe front of the cassone consists of a single deep (about 11cm) board (neatly excavated inside to form a shoulder), and a freize panel butting onto the single deep board. Integral to the deep board are the four relief panels, and the rearmost parts of the shield and supporters, and term figures, (the near shoulder of the end terms). The foremost parts of the term figures are built up with a top layer. The freize panel is carved in the solid with the heads of the term figures and a grotesque mask escutcheon\nThe freize panel has been rebacked with a replacement section.\nThe ends formed by a large single panel, below a separate freize panel. Integral to the main panel is the carved trophy (in low relief), the body of the rear term figure, and  part of the body of the front term angel figure. Integral to the freize is the head of the rear term figure, the head of the front term figure. A moulding of beads appears to have been nailed to the freize.\n\nThe back consists of a narrow board above a deep board (probably glued rather than doweled together), both roughly finished on the outside.\n  \nThe lid consists of a rectangular frame of half-lapped construction, held on three ring hinges (apparently original). The frame is carved on the front and ends with a fluted fore-edge, and overlapping coin pattern. It is plain along the back. On the frame stands a angled, rectangular frame formed by thick, cyma mouldings (meeting in a mitred joint), carved with superimposed acanthus leaf, and at the top edge a double cyma leaf moulding. This angled frame contains a flat panel, in the centre of which is an applied roundel with a grotesque male mask.\n\nThe bottom consists of two, (possibly doweled) boards, with moulded ends, nailed up into the sides, back and ends. The cassone stands on four lion feet (3 of which are apparently replacements, the rear left could be older).\n\nDescription of ornament, from left\n\nEnd: youthful term figure bust with breastplate, set on a plinth with scrolling shoulder\nTrophy panel with a winged helmet and bundle of arrows, 'suspended' on a cord from a ring   \nNaked female winged caryatid at the corner\nPanel with Apollo and Python\nNaked female caryatid \nPanel with Clymae and Phaeton\nShield supported by two putti\nPanel with Phaeton and Apollo (statue)\nNaked female caryatid \nPanel with Eridanus river god (Po)\nNaked female winged caryatid at the corner\nPanel with a scrollwork cartouche (or shield) with a cingquefoil boss, with twin ram head supporters, 'suspended' on a cord from a ring   \n\nAll the term figures wear bead necklaces (painted) and hair ornament. The rear term figures are youthful busts wearing a breastplate, the head inclined towards the front of the cassone\n\nReplacement parts: apron",

            "public_access_description": "This cassone (chest) and its pair (4416-1857, also in the V&A), were probably made to celebrate a marriage linking two wealthy families, whose arms are prominently displayed in the centre by naked putti. It is possible that it marked the marriage of Paolo Lancelloti and Giulia Delfini in Rome, in 1570. \n\nAcross the front of each cassone are four scenes carved in relief, relating to various episodes from Greek myth. On this cassone, from the left Apollo has shot dead the dragon or serpent, known as the Python which guarded the oracular shrine at Delphi (perhaps a play on the family name, Delfini), which Apollo then took his own oracle. The second scene probably shows the nymph Clymene, with  Phaethon her son by Helios (the sun), praying to the sun god. The third shows Phaeton as a youth asking Helios (like a living statue, on a plinth), for the use of his father's celestial chariot. The fourth scene shows a reclining river god with two attendants and probably represents Eridanus, into whose waters Phaethon crashed, when he could no longer control the fiery horses (a scene shown on the companion cassone). \n\nThe classical myth, with its themes of love, and the lessons of imprudence and filial duty/parental responsibility, would have been seen as resonant and edifying for a married couple. On the female term figures that separate the scenes, lion masks are strategically placed below their waist, and a fierce mask forms the escutcheon around the keyhole. Both details suggest that a symbolic guard is being placed over the family valuables and reputations.",
