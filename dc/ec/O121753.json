Images were generally printed on paper of a standard size. Here three such sheets have been used to create a larger picture. Woodblock prints are sometimes called ukiyo-e, which means 'pictures of the floating world'. This world was that of the pleasure district with its brothels, theatres and teahouses.\n\nSubject Depicted\nThe Tale of Genji was written by a court lady in the 11th century and is considered the world's first novel. It tells the story of the life and loves of Prince Genji, and, after his death, of Kaoru, supposedly his son but actually the grandson of his best friend. The influence of the Tale of Genji on the subsequent art and literature of Japan cannot be overestimated. This print is one of twelve depicting scenes from the Tale of Genji in each of the twelve months. The scene has been brought up to date, however, with figures in the fashions and surroundings of 19th-century Japan.  \n\nTime\nThis print was published in Edo just at the time that commercial and diplomatic ties were being established between Japan and western nations in the mid to late 1850s. During the second half of the 19th century large numbers of prints were exported to Europe and the United States. They were avidly sought out by western collectors, artists and designers, and played a major role in the development of 'Japonisme' and then art nouveau.",
