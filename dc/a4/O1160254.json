Others included The Panorama of Europe, The History of England, The Royal Game of British Sovereigns, The Wonders of Nature, and Joseph and His Brethren. All were designed to be played with counters and a numbered teetotum, or spinning dice. \n\nThis game takes players on a tour of London's visitor attractions of the early 1820s, including the Tower of London, the British Museum, Carlton Palace in Pall Mall, the Cosmorama Exhibition in St. James's Street, Punch and Judy and the theatre in the West End, and the Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens. It was sold by Edlin's Juvenile Library in London, specialists in games and puzzles: 'for the Instruction and Improvement of Youth'",
