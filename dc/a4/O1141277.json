He has continued to paint, and to make prints, alongside and often integrated with his writing.  His most acclaimed work is his first novel Lanark, published in 1981 and written over a period of almost 30 years. It is now regarded as a classic, and has been described as \"one of the landmarks of 20th-century fiction.\" Gray's works combine elements of realism, fantasy and science fiction, plus clever use of typography and his own illustrations. He has also written on politics, in support of socialism and Scottish independence. In addition to illustrating his own books he has also made prints such as this in which illustration takes precedent over the text.  This print is one of five which illustrate (and give the text of) Gray's own poems; they are very characteristic of his graphic style, and the wit and inventiveness of his illustration.",
