An inscription in pen on the lower left of the darwing reads, \u2018environs de Cusset, Ferme sur les hauteurs de l'ardoisi\u00e8re\u2019 while a visit to Cusset is recorded in a letter by Millet from June 1866 (Moreau-N\u00e9laton, <i>Millet racont\u00e9 par lui-m\u00eame</i>, vol. III, 1921, p. 10), but doubtless he went there on numerous occasions during his stay in Vichy. \n\nAlthough landscapes without figures are rare in Millet's work, the artist produced many sketches of this type while staying at Vichy between 1866 and 1868. He would rent a carriage to explore the surrounding countryside, in particular the hilly uplands above Cusset, stopping frequently to make rapid pencil or ink drawings in small sketchbooks. These sketches were later re-worked in the studio when the artist added watercolour. The present work contains varying notations, done in pencil, relating to landscape features and colours. This writing is visible beneath the washes of watercolour, further suggesting that the artist added the watercolour some time after he drew his subject.\n\nIn the drawing, Millet experimented with dark lines, creating areas of carved earth and foliage of differing sizes to form a receeding viewpoint. Millet was a founding member of the Barbizon school of painting whose members also included Jean-Baptiste Camille Corot, Th\u00e9odore Rousseau, and Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Daubigny. The group advocated a push toward Naturalism and utilized muted tonalities, looseness, and soft rendurings.",
