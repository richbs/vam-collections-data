Much of their material contains lyrics critical of the troubles in Northern Ireland.\n\nWith t-shirts becoming a staple fashion item for youth and rock 'n' rollers in the 1960s, promotional t-shirts printed to advertise products also became common place. This trend moved from corporate arena to youth movement with the merging of rock 'n' roll, advertising and fashion into the creation of the concert t-shirt, of which this is an example. Not only does it advertise a concert the wearer has been to, but concert and band t-shirts can also show the wearer's allegiance to specific musical subcultures or youth movements.",
