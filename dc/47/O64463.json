Inscribed, language: Sanskrit and dialect; script: Gaudiya, 10th-11th century, records the donation of the caitya (so-called stupa) by the Vajrayana-Panditacarya Rahulabhdra. Records the name of four persons: Valo, Mujja, Tingala and Sumati. Illustrates them with the Seven Jewels (sapta ratnas) and perhaps the Vajracarya Rahulabhadra seated in cross-legged position on a cushion holding vajra and ghanta, a person named Valo is shown below in kneel-down position and with folded hands towards the Vajracarya below. In the recess of the panel at the beginning from left to right are shown four persons in kneel-down position, perhaps called as Valo, Mujja, Tingala and Sumati on top, Valo and Mujja may be the parents and Tingala and Sumati, daughter and son respectively, and while the parents carry offerings, the children are shown with folded hands. Perhaps this Valo has been illustrated twice (once wrongly spelt Valo). After the four persons the Seven Jewels are shown in the following order: Hasti-ratna, Parinayaka-ratna, Mani-ratna, Cakra-ratna, Stri-ratna, Mantri-ratna and Asva-ratna followed by a tray with garland and flowers and with two offerings, one on each side.",
