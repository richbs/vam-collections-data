The play was revived in 1887, 1888, 1894, and 1902. Mephistopheles was Irving's second most frequently played role after Mathias in The Bells. \n\nBernard Partridge (1861-1945) was a painter and illustrator who became the principal cartoonist of Punch magazine.  He acted at the Lyceum in his youth, using the name Bernard Gould, and made many drawings of Irving, some of which appeared in the theatre's souvenir programmes. His work has provided both a record of costumes and scenery and of the dramatic effect of Irving's performances.",
