They lived there with their carers, the nursemaid, nanny and governess. All kinds of furnishings were designed specifically for children, including nursery wallpapers. People thought that these should show suitable designs. Some designs were educational, for example nursery rhymes and alphabets. Others were based on morally improving subjects. These were inspired by books such as John Bunyan\u2019s Pilgrim\u2019s Progress (1678) and Daniel Defoe\u2019s The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe (1719). Both books were republished in the 19th century in editions intended for children.",
