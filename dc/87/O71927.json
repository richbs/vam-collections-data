Later, in 1923, after her husband's death, the Princess gave it to the Museum.\n\nIn a letter relating to her acquisition of the piece, Princess Louise commented: 'It was modelled by Mr Fuller, an English Sculptor settled out there [in Florence], and is entitled \"A Centurion\".  It is very cleverly executed, and he took a great deal of trouble with it, and it went through all sorts of processes to give it an ancient look.'\n\nCharles Francis Fuller (1830-1875) joined the army in 1847, but left 1853 and travelled to Florence, where he studied under the American sculptor Hiram Powers (1805-1873). He appears to have lived in Florence from 1859 to about 1869, then at Rome for a period around 1871-5. He exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy between 1859 and 1875.",
