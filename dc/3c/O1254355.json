It was first performed at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Sarah Bernhardt, Paris, on 29 May 1926. Diaghilev had hoped to repeat the success of Les Matelots created the previous year and L\u00e9onide Massine choreographer of Les Matelots would probably have been a more appropriate choreographer of the over-elaborate narrative than Balanchine. Nevertheless Balanchine\u2019s inventive pas de deux for the tall Felia Doubrovska and rising star Serge Lifar indicated the development of his choreographic style. \n\nThe sheet of working ideas for the front cloth for Pastorale shows the Star holding an envelope and two further versions showing the star with bicycle behind her being the more finished  \n\n\nThe final design for the frontcloth is at the Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford, is drawn   in ink and pastel showing an elongated woman and man with bicycle emerging through the curtain. It is reproduced in Alexander Schouvaloff The Art of Ballets Russes (1997) p.287\n\nA similar apparent sketch for a front cloth by Pruna for Les Matelots is reproduced on the cover of the souvenir programme for the June 1925 season by the Ballets Russes at the Ga\u00eete Lyrique, Paris",
