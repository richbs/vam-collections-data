His arms are outstretched while nails are hammered through his hands by two figures behind the cross wearing gowns, the right-hand figure kneeling on one knee. A bearded figure at the top left of the panel, wearing a tunic, is represented pulling a rope over his right shoulder, as is a figure on the lower right. A figure on the lower left appears to be holding a hammer. \n\nThe whole of the lower part of the panel is missing. The head and right arm of the figure at the top right of the panel are missing, as is the leg of the figure at the top left. The top of the panel behind the figures has been restored with plaster. The face of Christ is worn.\n\nThe executioners' faces are darkened in the customary way. A considerable amount of the usual green paint and daisy pattern remain on the ground and also on the cross. The background at the top of the panel is decorated with gesso knobs and gilded. The panel has been backed with slate.",

His arms are outstretched while nails are hammered through his hands by two figures behind the cross wearing gowns. A bearded figure at the bottom left of the panel is represented pulling a rope over his right shoulder. It has been suggested that the presence of ropes in the image may be directly influenced by the practical problems of showing the Crucifixion realistically on the medieval stage.",
