They were probably offcuts or fabric samples from his workrooms. Many of the patches are printed or woven dress-silks, but cotton, wool, and even lurex patches appear, documenting the broad range of luxury textiles used by couturiers.\n\nThe maker's father was part of the high-end London fashion market. He owned R. L. Salmon Ltd, a London-based dress manufacturer which had exclusive rights to reproduce Jacques Heim's Paris collections between 1957 and 1969. He would have been well-positioned to acquire the fabric samples used to make this skirt.",
