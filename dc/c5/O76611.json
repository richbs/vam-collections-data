Typically, the chambu has a spherical body of more or less compressed form, a high foot, and a short flaring neck. The decoration on this piece incorporates typical chased decoration of the ten avatars, or incarnations, of the god Vishnu, the phallic linga shrines sacred to Shiva, and a depiction of Shiva riding his bull, Nandi. From his head pours the Ganges stream, cutting across the bands of decoration below to the last one which represents the sacred Ganges river. In the river are the primordial tortoise, fish, a snake and an empty boat with four oars. The band between depicts the route followed by pilgrims circumambulating Varanasi, passing the temples and sacred sites along the way. The piece is dated 1822 of the Vikramsamvat era, or 1765-66 AD.",
