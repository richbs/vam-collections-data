He had purchased them from the Maharaja of Jaipur in Rajasthan, and it is thought that this example was made by the court jewellers of Jaipur in the early 18th century.\nTurban jewels in the Mughal tradition of the subcontinent from the 16th century were emblems of royalty, worn only by the emperor and his sons. However, by the 18th century when this jewel was probably made, Mughal power had declined and formerly intractable rules were being broken. The rulers of regional kingdoms, whether Hindu or Muslim, then also adopted turban jewels as emblems of rank, and were virtually independent, even though they still formally acknowledged the Mughal emperor as their ruler.",
