Addey (1912-1999) worked as a commercial artist for over sixty years, working for Dorland Advertising and Mitchells among other London advertising firms. His work shows the range of products and illustration styles, from aeroplanes and cars, beer and perfume, to satirical cartoons and calendar pin-up girls and is representative of the post war boom in advertising during the late 1940s and 1950s.\n\nThis design in blue and red ink is for a poster for an exhibition titled \"Trust the People\". Simple forms have been used to create strong recognisable silhouettes of standing figures in the top left corner and the profile of a man's head with an upraised hand in the right foreground. The style of the figures is continued in a bold type which contrasts with the use of type in the style of handwriting for the word \"Exhibition\". The combination of blue and red against a white background with the style of illustration creates a bold composition that can immediately be noticed and read by its audience.",
