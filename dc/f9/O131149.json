The Malaysian-born principal dancer of The Royal Ballet, Ravenna Tucker is shown as Swanilda dressed as Copp\u00e9lia, with the Australian character dancer John Auld as the eccentric Dr Copp\u00e9lius. Peter Wright's production of Copp\u00e9lia for the Birmingham Royal Ballet was his final major production prior to his retirement as the company's artistic director (1977-1995). First performed at the Birmingham Hippodrome on 3 March 1995, this production celebrated the 125 Anniversary of the ballet's creation at the Paris Op\u00e9ra in 1870.  Sets and costumes were by Peter Farmer, who has the ability to treat traditional ballet costumes with respect and imagination.\n\nBased on The Sandman by E.T.A. Hoffmann and danced to an original score by L\u00e9o Delibes, Copp\u00e9lia quickly won its place in the international ballet repertoire. Peter Wright's production was based on the staging by Marius Petipa and Enrico Cecchetti for the Imperial Russian Ballet as re-staged for the Vic-Wells Ballet in 1933 by Nicolai Sergueyev.",
