It was worn by the mother of Lady Hoyer Millar. In September 1900 The Queen, The Lady's Newspaper described the ideal tea-gown: 'It is quite a perfect gown showing soft falling kilted flounces at the hem, silk muslin or silk serving to enhance the beauty of incomparable lace'. \n\nThe waist stay (20 inch waist) has the 'Worth Paris' label and is inscribed with the number '63331'. Charles Frederick Worth (1825-1895) was a celebrated couture dressmaker in Paris. He was born in England at Bourne in Lincolnshire, and started working at the age of 12 in a draper\u2019s shop in London. After working for various haberdashers and silk mercers, he left for Paris in 1845. In 1858 he went into partnership with a Swedish businessman, Otto Bobergh, and opened his own house. He was soon patronised by the Empress Eug\u00e9nie (1826-1920), wife of the French Emperor, Napoleon III, and her influence was instrumental to his success. Obtaining made-to-measure clothes from his house was a symbol of social and financial success. They were appreciated for their beauty, elegance and fine workmanship.",
