The Taming of the Shrew, directed by Denis Carey, opening on 30 November 1954. Kenneth Rowell designed the sets and costumes, creating a world of bright primary colours. 'There could be no doubt from the moment the curtain went up that this was to be a comedy' wrote Mary Clarke in the book which commemorated the second season of the five year plan.  The costumes were loosely based on Elizabethan and Renaissance fashions. Gwen Cherrell, who played Bianca as 'an infuriatingly sweet and sugary little idiot' according to Clarke, wore this costume in the final, wedding, scene. \n\nKenneth Rowell (1920-1999) began designing for dance in his native Australia in the 1940s. Following the success of his designs for Ballet Rambert's 1949 Australian tour, Marie Rambert and Laurence Olivier recommended Rowell for a British Council scholarship, and in 1950 he came to London to study. Two years late John Gielgud commissioned him to create the costumes for Macbeth at Stratford-upon-Avon and this established Rowell as a major stage designer. Based in England for thirty years, he worked as both a designer and a painter, returning to live in Australia in 1982.",
