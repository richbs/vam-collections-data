They usually wore them on a black velvet ribbon, fastened tightly round the neck like a choker, with a slide at the front.  The ribbon passes through the bale of the cross, and is then threaded through a hole or loop at the base of the slide, and out at either side.  The ribbon is tied in a bow at the back of the neck.\n\nNormandy has the greatest variety of crosses, some so elaborate as to be almost unrecognisable.  This cross is very similar to the later croix de Saint-L\u00f4, also called a croix quadrille from its lozenge shape, but lacks the ring of small crystals round the base of the high conical mounts which are its distinguishing characteristic.  \n\nLike all Normandy crosses, it was made to be worn with a matching slide, but these are often lost.  The slide on this cross was made in Normandy in the late 18th or early 19th century, but does not match the cross precisely.",
