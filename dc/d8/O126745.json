On this white ground is a larger design of linked blue hexagons, chrysanthemums and plum blossoms in faded red, blue and yellow pigments and dyes, and grey-mauve and gold embroidery.\nThe ground weave is a damask of the type known as <i>rinzu</i>. It is a 5-end warp faced satin weave figured with a 5-end weft-faced satin weave. The hexagons and chrysanthemums are resist-dyed with clusters of spots known as <i>kanoko shibori</i>. At least some of these effects may have been produced by the use of stencils. Additional colour has been brushed over some of the chrysanthemums.\nThe centres of the hexagons and chrysanthemums are embroidered with gold couched thread and some of the plum flowers are entirely worked in this method. The other plum flowers are worked in satin stitch embroidery in grey-mauve floss silk, and green floss silk is used for rudimentary branches.\nThe garment is lined throughout with thin red plain weave silk and the cuffs are lined with white damask self-patterned with bird roundels against a diaper of crossing wavy lines. There is a small red silk wadded hem.",
