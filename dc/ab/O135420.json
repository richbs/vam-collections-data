The photograph is thus a record of the work done, probably taken between 1865 -1880 and comes from an archive of designs and photographs from the firm. \n\nThere are printed designs for similar finials in a pattern book lettered 'Skidmore's Art Manufactures Co. Book of Designs' in Coventry Public Library. The page of designs is lettered 'Designs for Wrought Iron Finials Vanes'. Some printed designs for finials are in a private collection which are from a later date than the ones in Coventry because they are lettered 'BIRMINGHAM' as below. In 1872 Skidmore's Art Manufactures and Constructive Ironwork Company went into liquidation and was taken over by Winfields of Birmingham so it appears that Skidmore was still producing similar weather vanes for more than seven years from 1865 because the pattern book in Coventry Library is lettered with the title that Skidmore's firm used from this earlier date. The page of designs in the private collection is lettered 'VANES, FINIALS and HINGES.' and 'F:A:SKIDMORE: COVENTRY and 24 HUNTERS Rd BIRMINGHAM.'",

Peter Howell (see References) has some printed designs for railings in his private collection which are from a later date than the ones in Coventry because they are lettered 'BIRMINGHAM' as below. In the 1872 Skidmore's Art Manufactures and Constructive Ironwork Company went into liquidation and was taken over by Winfields of Birmingham so it appears that Skidmore was still producing similar railings for more than seven years from 1865 because the pattern book in Coventry Library is lettered with the title that Skidmore's firm used from this earlier date. The page of designs in Peter Howell's collection is lettered 'EXTERIOR RAILING, and GATES. balconies & c.'  and 'F:A:SKIDMORE: COVENTRY and 24 HUNTERS Rd BIRMINGHAM.'\n\nAttribution note: This albumen print is a photographic record of a gate produced by Francis Skidmore 's firm Skidmore's Art Manufactures Company, Coventry.",
