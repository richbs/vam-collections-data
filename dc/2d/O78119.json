He used bright primary colours and simple regular repeat patterns in his wallpapers, which is clearly visible here. This design is very clearly drawn to show one repeat of the pattern.\n\nPlace\nPugin was in charge of decorative furnishings for the Houses of Parliament in London, known at the time as the New Palace of Westminster.  This is the design for one of over 100 wallpapers that Pugin created for the Houses of Parliament. It was part of a group of papers that introduced badges and symbols connected with the history of the building. The white hart or stag was the badge of Richard II and the gold cross and birds on a blue background was the emblem associated with Edward the Confessor. The stag and the 'R' were used in designs for tiles for the lobby between Westminster Hall and the Members' Entrance.\n\nDesign & Designing\nPugin's many wallpapers were important and influenced other wallpaper designers at the time. This design is typical of  Pugin's designs in its use of heraldic emblems. Where possible Pugin used elements he found in original medieval designs. Although this paper was never produced, the design was probably adapted by Pugin for another wallpaper.",
