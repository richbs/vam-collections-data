The inner central space is divided into 2 zones by repeating [a], the upper triangular part decorated with 5 small cartouches outlined in blue, yellow and black, each containing a Shikashti [spelling?] inscription in one or two lines worked in black straight stitches, largely worn away.  These bordered a triangular motif filled with stepped lozenges in green, yellow and blue.  The lower part is rectangular containing a lobed cartouche outlined in green, white and black chain stitch framing a black and white inscription worked in straight stitches. Different on all 4 sides with an infill of a rosette and buds.\nThe cap extends to form a flap along the bottom: it is interlined with heavy plain weave silk behind a pieced red woollen fabric, possibly twill tapestry, with offset rows of botehs densely infilled with fan-shaped floral motifs against a densely packed ground; the predominant colours are light and dark blue, lightgreen, yellow, pink and white.  This flap is also lined with Astrakhan and could be used as a neck protector or could be it could be worn upturned at the front [see mid-17th century Safavid Court paintings].\n\nFacing: originally along all the lower edges but now just along the lower edge of the flap.  Largely distintegrated because of moth damage but originally a dark blue and white striped wool, possibly twill tapestry.  Bias-cut, the stripes contain a leaf meander in yellow or light green with red, white and yellow details.  \nInterlining: Where the facing has worn away it is possible to see an olive green plain weave silk interlining.\nTrimming: on all seams and along the edges is a metal thread braid.\nEmbroidery Thread: silk, 2S.\nMetal Thread: silver-gilt strip close S-wound on yellow silk core.",
