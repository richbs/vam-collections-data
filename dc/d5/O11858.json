Brass mounts, oncolite limestone top. The top drawer has a shaped front and a brass knob in the form of a floral spray. Below the drawer is a fall-front with a  writing surface of green leather, tooled and gilded, and two inner drawers with an open compartment above. The drawer-fronts are inlaid with a geometric pattern. Below the fall-front is a shaped door which opens to reveal a cupboard with a single shelf.\n\nThe fall-front and cupboard door have marquetry of flowers and tendrils, the wood used for the flowers and leaves cut across the grain to show the growth rings. The flowers are set against four panels of veneer, in which the grain of the wood is arranged to form a diamond shape. The fall-front and cupboard door have edging strips of brass, and the corner mounts are in the form of acanthus leaves and husks.",

The lyre-shaped body was fashionable in France at the time for such small, delicate writing desks. The decoration of flowers in veneers cut across the grain of small branches (\u2018end-grain\u2019 or \u2018bois de bout\u2019 marquetry) was also used at the time by high-quality cabinetmakers. \n\nHowever, some of the details of construction, particularly of the drawers, suggest that the secr\u00e9taire was made in London in the early 19th century. This piece is branded with the initials \u2018EHB\u2019 for the 19th-century dealer and cabinetmaker Edward Holmes Baldock. He ran a profitable business in London, selling antique furniture, glass and china and repairing and copying pieces of furniture made in Paris in the 18th century. This secr\u00e9taire was probably made between 1830 and 1845.",
