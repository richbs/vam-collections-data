            "history_note": "Historical significance: Guiseppe de Levis was born and died in Verona.  He came from a large family of sculptors and bronze foundry men although he was by far the most successful.  His works have been identified from the signature that he frequently cast on to his works: IOSEPH DE LEVIS IN VERONA MI FECE.  In addition to his signature, de Levis also often dated his works which has allowed around 30 works to be clearly attributed to him.  There was speculation that he may have been Jewish on account the way he signed his name, Jospeh de Levis, but this has been discounted since Rognini discovered that his family came from the village of Levo.  The Latinized form of his name was considered normal at the time by people who were keen to elevate their positions in society if they were not originally of noble birth.  \n\nDe Levis specialised in ornamental artefacts such as bells, mortars, inkstands, door-knockers and firedogs.  For smaller figurines etc he was skilled enough to work alone but for more challenging and significant figures he would often collaborate with the sculptor, Angelo de Rossi.   When working together, the sculptors would both sign the works.  The V&A firedogs are signed by Giuseppe de Levis alone however. \n\nIn many of his works, and indeed on these firedogs, Giuseppe de Levis used a number of motifs such as sphinx like forms and sea horses.  It is often difficult to tell how personal motifs are.  It could be perceived that since we see motifs such as sea horses frequently on works by Giuseppe de Levi, that they could signify his handicraft when they appear on unsigned utensils.  In reality, it is likely that they were common property of all of the founderies of the day.  In turn, it is probable that artists borrowed such devices from one another.",
