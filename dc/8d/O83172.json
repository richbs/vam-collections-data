Day continues to work for style magazines such as Ray Gun, Dazed and Confused and Vogue Homme International. In contrast to the traditional and glamorous image which dominated fashion photography during the late 1980's, Day\u2019s work represents a more informal, confrontational and confessional approach to the medium. She has used unconventional, and sometimes androgynous models to question the gender stereotyping found in the mainstream media and magazines.",
