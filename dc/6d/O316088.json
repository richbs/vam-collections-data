The donor remembers her mother and other ladies attending diplomatic receptions in the formal trains and removing the trains for dancing. The dress originally had a wide frill of lace round the neck opening and shoulder straps according to a photograph given at the same time, which was removed before the dress was donated.\n\nThis dress is a superb example of Parisian haute couture at its most luxurious and sumptuous, showing the fine quality of late 19th century couture beading and embroidery. The immense train and soft creamy silk satin ground offer a canvas for the bead embroidery to be seen to advantage.",
