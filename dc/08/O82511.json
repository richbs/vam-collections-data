The head covered with a low crown ornamented with conventional floral-motives, with sockets for jewels.  On the top of the skull was a triple ushnisha, of which two tiers  are broken away, as is the back of the head.  The surface is well patinated.\n\nThe crowned Buddha has been a recurrent theme in Thai sculpture since the Khmer-Lopburi type appeared in the mid-12th century.  The figures are adorned in a simplified version of the 12th-century type but retain the richly decorated crown, with the skull protuberance (usnisa), missing on this example, above.  The Ayudha style appears to draw as much on the earlier Lopburi school as it does on its immediate predecessor, the Sukhothia school.",
