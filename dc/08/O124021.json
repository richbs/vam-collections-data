III in <i>L'Art Fantastique de Gutsave Moreau, Paris, 1960</i>, by Ragner von Holten and in the water-colour \"L'Apparition\", illustrated as no.17 in von Holten, which Moreau exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1876.  The attitude and rhythm of the dancer's body are very similar to those of Salom\u00e9 in two oil sketches: \"L'Apparition\" no.222 of the <i>Catalogue Sommaire du Gustave Moreau, Paris</i>, in 1926 and Salom\u00e9 \"Tatou\u00e9e\" no.19 and to a drawing of Salom\u00e9 no.20 in von Holten. \nThis drawing was formerly in the collection of Charles Hess\u00e8le.\"\nPierre-Louis Mathieu, <u>Catalogue raisonn\u00e9 de l\u2019oeuvre achev\u00e9</u>, Fribourg, 1976, pl. 315, p. 334.\nPierre-Louis Mathieu, <u>Gustave Moreau Monographie et Nouveau Catalogue de l\u2019oeuvre achev\u00e9</u>, Paris, 1998, pl. 353, p. 388.\nRachel Sloan, 'Gustave Moreau and the Raffalovich family: new documents on Sappho', <u>The Burlington Magazine</u> CXLVIII (May 2006), p. 330.\nCompares Sapho\u2019s stance, particularly the raised arm and tapered legs to the work, Apollo victorious over the serpent Python, ca. 1885, (National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa).",

Op\u00e9ra de Sapho\u2019, it was to serve in part as a costume design portraying Mademoiselle Subra, the dancing star of the Paris Opera Company. Mademoiselle Subra may have performed Sapho at the 1884 revival of Charles Gounod\u2019s opera, <i>Sapho,</i> at the Paris Opera (Palais Garnier). Fran\u00e7ois Pierre R\u00e9gnier, the Opera manager, asked Moreau to design the costumes for the production. However, the designs were eventually sold at a benefit for the widow of a former director, having not been utilized for unknown reasons. \n\nThe dancer\u2019s elaborate dress was undoubedtly influenced by orientalist tastes. Moreau often used outside visual sources containing what was seen as new and exotic material; for further evidence of this see <i>Sappho</i>, also in the V&A\u2019s collection ( P.11-1934), which shows her in a Japanese kimono inspired by popular prints being sold in Paris at the time. \n\nThe figure of Sappho reccurs many times in Moreau\u2019s oeuvre and in particlular the artist re-worked her pose in several works. For instance, the dancer\u2019s mood and stance are related to that of Salom\u00e9, in the oil paintings <i>Salom\u00e9 Dancing before Herod</i> (Mus\u00e9e Gustave Moreau, Paris), and to the body of Apollo in <i>Apollo victorious over the serpent Python</i>, 1885, (National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa). Also reminiscent is the watercolour <i>L'Apparition</i> (Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris), which Moreau exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1876, and a drawing of Salom\u00e9 (Jean Ehrmann collection). In addition, two oil sketches representing Salom\u00e9, <i>L'Apparition</i> (Fogg Art Museum, Harvard) and <i>Salom\u00e9 Tatou\u00e9e</i> (Mus\u00e9e Gustave Moreau, Paris), are akin to the costume design.",
