The cover depicts Eugene Statton with 'blackface'<sup>1</sup> dressed in a white waistcoat, trousers, coat, top hat and shirt with red bow tie. Also depicted is a girl leaning on a fence and staring out over a lake dressed in a maid's outfit with bonnet.\n\n<sup>1</sup>Blackface is a style of theatrical makeup that originated in the United States around 1830 and which was based on racist stereotypes of African Americans. It was most commonly used in the minstrel performance tradition. White performers (and sometimes black) used burnt cork, greasepaint or shoe polish to blacken their skin and exaggerate their lips. The look was completed with \u2018woolly\u2019 wigs, gloves, tailcoats and/or ragged clothes. Blackface was a performance tradition in American theatre for over 100 years and was also popular overseas. Stereotypes embodied in the stock characters of blackface minstrelsy played a significant role in cementing and proliferating racist attitudes. While the term itself is not problematic, the tradition to which it refers is grounded in racism.",
