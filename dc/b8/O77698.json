In this saddle watch and pedometer, the movement of the horse causes the watch and outer case to jerk up and down, making the chain pull on the pedometer mechanism each time, and record the number of paces.  The small dial on the right counts up to ten paces, the dial on the left 0-100 paces.  The perimeter of the main dial is calibrated with 0-10,000 paces   The top dial shows the time.",
