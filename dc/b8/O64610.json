Under Warner, Jeffrey & Co. became one of the most innovative and successful wallpaper manufacturers in Europe. They raised standards of design in the industry by employing artists such as Crane.\n\nThis pattern has not been identified as yet, but it includes many of the motifs Crane used in his designs, such the phoenix, a serpent, and pomegranates. Unfortunately the paper has been painted over with white emulsion; originally it would have been richly coloured and probably highlighted with gold pigment, in imitation of the 17th-century embossed leather wall-hangings it was designed to imitate.",
