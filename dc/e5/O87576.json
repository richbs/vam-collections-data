Around the 'pool' are four yellow stylised trees and four U-shapes which are filled with geometric motifs.  In each corner of the cover is a stylised red palmette flanked by white leaf forms; these alternate with a large U-shaped motif in beige and with other scattered motifs.\nA narrow yellow border has a thin black angular meander carrying blue, red, yellow and green leaf forms.\nEmbroidery threads: 2S silk; white, beige, black, red, blue, green and yellow.\nThere are some repairs using surface darning which may indicate that surface darning is a more recent technique.\nCould this design be seen as a version of a Persian Garden Carpet?",
