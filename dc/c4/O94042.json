At first glance, this photograph could be mistaken for a fashion plate, the models turning just so in order to display the sweep of the dresses. On looking more closely, however, j becomes clear that Isabella Grace is dressed in the height of fashion. In keeping with fashion developments of 1863 and 1864, her crinoline is fuller at the back rather than round, i a style which led ultimately to the bustle in the 1870s. With her hat and jacket on, she could be preparing to go out to mak calls. In contrast, Florence Elizabeth is costumed from the dressing-up box. The skirt which has been draped over her light summer dress appears in many other photographs. Though she seems not to be wearing a crinoline, her outfit has been carefully arranged so that her silhouette complements her sister's form. The basic formal contrasts of the composition serve to counterpoint its centre: Isabella Grace's serene face, steady and in focus, poised beside Florence Elizabeth's wavering, unfocused profil perdu.'",
