In 18th-century London, leading citizens founded institutions to assist the poor, sick and isolated. Prevention was better than a cure, and in 1758 the Asylum for Female Orphans was founded to prevent prostitution. In the same year the Magdalen Hospital was established to reform repentant prostitutes.\n\nHospital governors recognised the importance of religion in educating and nurturing those for whom they cared. Regular communion was considered part of the healing process. In poorhouses parish officers saw that communion was celebrated and prayer books distributed.\n\nIn the Poor Houses Parish officers saw that communion was celebrated and prayer books distributed .In December 1822 the Overseers of the Poor paid \u00a32.2s for twenty-four Prayer Books. In January 1823 they paid \u00a33 11 shillings to the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge for Bibles.",
