The necklace consists of a series of open rings made from curved ribbon wire, arranged as if they were to be threaded on a thick thread, with the edge of the ring facing out.  The edges of the rings are alternately patterned with a series of engraved zigzags, and a hammered effect.  There is a loop attached at the top and bottom of each ring.  The rings are joined together by small loops of ribbon wire connecting the loops at the top and bottom of each ring.  These joining loops are each decorated with an applied coil ring on the front.  At the ends of the necklace the last three rings on each side are soldered together to form the base of a snap clasp.\n\nThe pendant is made of filigree in the shape of a Maltese cross, with swallow-tail ends, and motifs in the interstices between the arms.  There is a disc of gold, with a flower in the centre enamelled in dark blue on white, riveted to the cross in the centre.  This central disc is surrounded by a circle of small coil rings.  Rosettes of filigree and sheet gold are soldered to the inner ends of the arms and to the motifs between the arms.  There is a triangular loop at the top of the cross, for suspension, to which is attached a large decorative filigree loop.",
