She rests her right foot on the neck of the beast which appears from under the hem of her skirt. She is otherwise naked except for  her jewellery which comprises a  heavy segmented necklace under a row of beads, large circular ringed earrings and heavy wrist bangles. Her hair is swept back off her face and gathered into a bun on top with an ornament fixed in the centre parting above her forehead. Her large eyes are modelled with incised lines under arched incised eyebrows. Her remaining two arms are uplifted, her left hand holding a large bell (<i>ghanta</i>) andin her right one a baton-shaped unidentified weapon. (According to the <u>Devi Mahatmya</u>, the bell was given to her by Indra when the gods were arming her for battle with the demonic forces (<i>asuras</i>) led by Mahisa).",

It is a recurrent subject in Hindu sculpture from the Kushan period (1st century AD-320 AD) onwards. \n\nThis form of Durga goes through an elaborate iconographic evolution which we can trace through rock-cut and freestanding versions. The majority are large-scale images in a temple context. This representation is a small-scale terracotta, crudely modelled for use perhaps in a household or wayside shrine. It shows Durga in an early four-armed form, lifting the buffalo's body up by the tail and holding its head down with her foot so she can despatch it with Shiva's trident.",

The original text submitted in English reads:\n\n2: 50 Durga\nMetamorphosed limestone; 143 cm high\nIndia, South, KarNaTaka, Mysore region, mid-13th century CE\nVictoria and Albert Museum IS.77-1965\n\n2: 51 Sculpture of Durga\nTerracotta; 17.5 cm high\nIndian, North, 7th century CE\nVictoria and Albert Museum IS.71-1986, given by Mary and Douglas Barrett\n\nDurga, the goddess represented in these two sculptures, is one of the most commonly depicted of any form of the goddess in India. In her role as Durga Mahishasuramardini, \u2018slayer of the demon Mahisha\u2019, Durga saves the male gods and the universe from defeat. The worship of Durga images can be traced as far back as the Kushan period (1st century CE \u2013 320 CE), with surviving images being found at Mathura in North India dating to this period. The first textual accounts of Durga killing the buffalo demon are later, among them the Devibhagavata PuraNa (5th to 7th century CE) and the Devimahatmya, provisionally dated to the 8th century. In these texts, her independent and fierce nature is clearly apparent. \n\tAlthough often considered a form of Siva\u2019s consort Parvati, Durga \u2013 the inaccessible - is rarely depicted in a domestic setting, or even with a male consort. Instead Durga is typically realised as a dynamic warrior goddess, defeating all before her. Both sculptures represent the final moment of the battle between Durga and Mahisha, a powerful demon, who takes the form of a buffalo and is invincible to all but a woman. Durga, however, was created from the fierce energy of the male deities and endowed with their weapons. Spurning his offers of marriage, Durga finally slays the shape-shifting Mahisha by cutting off his buffalo head and striking the emerging demon with a trident given to her by Siva. \nThe small terracotta image was probably made for a small domestic or wayside shrine, whereas the larger stone example came from a temple. Both show Durga towering over the other figures, with \u2013 especially in the later sculpture - a calm, detached expression, belying any connection with the violent events taking place. \nThe terracotta plaque, made at a time before the iconography of the episode had fully crystallised, shows a four-armed Durga killing the buffalo with her trident, while pressing its neck down with her foot and lifting it by the tail. Her upper hands hold a bell and an unidentified weapon. The buffalo appears to be excreting in death, a touch of sordid realism.\nIn the 13th-century sculpture, Mahisha has resumed his human form and rises out of the buffalo\u2019s hide, only to be speared by Durga. Her multiple arms surround her, holding a selection of weapons and framing the central figure. The lavish embellishment of this sculpture, such as the scrolling decoration in the arched surround and the heavy jewellery she wears, is typical of the HoysaLa dynasty (11th-14th centuries), generous patrons of the arts who ruled much of what is now KarNaTaka. \nThe worship of Durga is still a major part of the Hindu festival calendar, with a large series of rituals being held in her name. Durga Puja, held in the autumn months, involves the creation of large images of the goddess vanquishing the demon. These images are worshipped throughout the festival, which culminates in the submergence of the images in nearby rivers, lakes, ponds or tanks. \n\nCam Sharp Jones and Nick Barnard",

This form of Durga goes through an elaborate iconographic evolution that may be traced through rock-cut and freestanding versions of the subject. The regional distribution of this form of Mahisasuramardini was limited to northern India, centred on Mathura and extending across Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. Durga during the post-Gupta period became increasingly identified with Shiva as his <i>shakti</i>, having formerly been associated more closely with Vishnu. Durga was already the subject of large-scale stone and metal sculptures by this period, as witness in Madhya Pradesh at Udaigiri and elsewhere; this small-scale terracotta has been crudely modelled for use perhaps in a household or wayside shrine.",
