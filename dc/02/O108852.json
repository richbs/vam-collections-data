            "physical_description": "The tome was built for the emperor Humayan during the reign of his son Akbar. \n\nAs seen in this photograph, the tomb consists of a small platform about 1.5 m in height. Standing on this is a high platform 6.5m high by 99 m wide per side. Each of the sides of the high platform has 17 arches and the corners are chamferred with an oblique arch. The central arch on each side has a staircase which leads to the next level, the mausoleum itself. The mausoleum has a square plan (47.54m across) although it is octagonal in shape because of the slightly campherred corners.\n\nThe over exposure of this (negative?) photograph makes it difficult to see the white marble dome at the top of the mausoleum. The bright Indian sunlight often made it difficult to photograph white marble. This was the first double dome to be built in India, a favourite Persian device whereby the external structure  was given an imposing exterior dome but the interior was smaller and kept in proportion to the rest of the internal structure. The dome rises to over 42.67m and is the first full dome in India as all other pervious domes did not trace a full semi-circle. It is surrounded by small pavilions or Chhattris, which were once believed to serve as madrasa (colleges).  The Chhattris and the red sandstone and white marble panels of the fa\u00e7ade are the primary  Indian architectural influences to this largely Persian style monument.",

It is also the first example of a garden-tomb. The tomb is particularly important in the history of Indian architecture as it is the prototype for the Taj Mahal. \n\nThe British photographer Samuel Bourne lived and worked in India between 1862 and 1869. During this time he toured the Himalayas and travelled through the subcontinent, photographing its landscape, architecture and historical sites. He set up a studio in Simla with Charles Shepherd and sold his prints sold to an eager public both in India and Britain.",

            "historical_context_note": "The tome was built for the emperor Humayan during the reign of his son Akbar. Although Humanyan\u2019s widow, Bega Begam (Haji Begam) is popularly thought to have commissioned it, some documents suggest that it was  Akbar who played the more significant part. The monument has been dated to between  1562 and1571 and was designed by the Persian architect Mirak Mirza Ghiyas. \n\nThe tomb is the first substantial piece of Mughal architecture in India incorporating symmetry, high arches, a double dome and also the first example of a garden tomb. It is particularly important in the history of architecture as it is the prototype for the Taj Mahal. \n\nAs seen in this photograph, the tomb consists of a small platform about 1.5 m in height. Standing on this is a high platform 6.5m high by 99 m wide per side. Each of the sides of the high platform has 17 arches and the corners are chamferred with an oblique arch. The central arch on each side has a staircase which leads to the next level, the mausoleum itself. The mausoleum has a square plan (47.54m across) although it is octagonal in shape because of the slightly campherred corners.\n\nThe over exposure of this (negative?) photograph makes it difficult to see the white marble dome at the top of the mausoleum. The bright Indian sunlight often made it difficult to photograph white marble. This was the first double dome to be built in India, a favourite Persian device whereby the external structure  was given an imposing exterior dome but the interior was smaller and kept in proportion to the rest of the internal structure. The dome rises to over 42.67m and is the first full dome in India as all other pervious domes did not trace a full semi-circle. It is surrounded by small pavilions or Chhattris, which were once believed to serve as madrasa (colleges).  The Chhattris and the red sandstone and white marble panels of the fa\u00e7ade are the primary  Indian architectural influences to this largely Persian style monument.\n\nAlongside the emperor Humayan, several other Mughal rulers are buried here. It was also here that the last Mughal emperor, Bahadur Shah II was captured  by the British in 1857, after the Indian \u2018Mutiny\u2019.",
