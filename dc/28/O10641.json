(See Further Information.) They are purported to have been written by Charles I (1600-1649) to his wife Henrietta Maria (1609-1669) on the window of his prison at Carisbrooke Castle on the Isle of Wight, where he was detained in 1646. There is, however, no evidence to support this supposed provenance. The glass  is hand blown and extremely thin, qualities compatible with a 17th-century date.\n\nPeople\nCharles I ruled Britain and Ireland from 1625 to 1649. He had an authoritarian conviction that he ruled by 'divine right' and was answerable only to God. This rendered him incapable of coming to terms with Parliament's demands for increased powers. In 1642 these quarrels culminated in the declaration of war against the Parliamentarians. Despite initial success in the Civil War, the Royalists were eventually defeated by Oliver  Cromwell's New Model Army. In 164, Charles was captured. Charged with 'crimes against the realm of England', he was beheaded on 30 January 1649 at Whitehal, Londonl.\n\nCharles married Henrietta Maria, the sister of Louis XIII of France (ruled 1610-1643), in 1625. It was not until the assassination of the King's court favourite - George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham - three years later, in 1628, that he seems to have developed any real love for his wife. Thereafter, he came to value the Queen's counsel in state affairs very highly. If genuine, the inscriptions on these windows certainly tesify to their devotion to one another.",
