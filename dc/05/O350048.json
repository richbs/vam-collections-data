He was one of the most important sculptors active in this country in the first half of the 18th century, and specialised in portrait busts and funerary monuments. Although he never visited Italy, many of his works are clearly indebted to classical archetypes. His terracotta models are particularly fine, and are often virtually finished pieces in their own right.",

In a further letter of 23 September 1921, Mr Woods wrote, 'My mother had several groups of single busts - (in my childhood) - which I understood came to her from some Dorsetshire kinsfolk whose deaths did not take place so early as I imagined. I do not know how long the objects may have been in the possession of the Dorsetshire people before their deaths, but the latest date may even be 1834 that is to say the date of the death of the old lady from whom they are supposed to have come to my mother.'
