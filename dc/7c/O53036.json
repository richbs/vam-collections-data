It is one of a pair with an octagonal table en suite.\n\nPlaces\nIn 1805 there was already a very large library, of two stories with a gallery, at Stowe House, Buckinghamshire. The Gothic Library was created in a former schoolroom below the existing Library and connected to it by a staircase. It was furnished with a set of Indian 17th-century carved ebony chairs, as well as the suite of furniture, which included this table.\n\nHistorical Associations\nMessrs Christie & Manson sold the contents of Stowe House on the premises over 40 days in August, September and October 1848. The sale, caused by the massive debts of the Duke of Buckingham, attracted buyers that included Queen Victoria, who had recently visited Stowe with Prince Albert, several members of the Rothschild family, and various prominent dealers from London. The pair of side tables and the octagonal table en suite were bought by the same person and remained together until 1972. The octagonal table is now in the Brighton Museum and Art Gallery.",
