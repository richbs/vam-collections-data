            "public_access_description": "William Mulready RA (1786-1863) was born in Ireland but moved to London in 1799.  With the encouragement of the Scottish painter John Graham (1794-1866) he entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1800.  His early work tackled a wide range of subjects, including history and portraits, but by 1815 he focused almost exclusively on domestic subjects.  He noted his own goals as \u2018Story, Character, Expression, Beauty\u2019 and together with the Scottish painter David Wilkie (1785-1841) was the most popular and admired artist in the genre.\n\n\u2018First Love\u2019 is a good example of the precise detail and brilliant colour which Mulready employed in his domestic scenes.  It also shows the layers of meaning he incorporated in his work through carefully selected titles.  In the exhibition catalogue to the 1986 exhibition on Mulready held at the V&A, Marcia Pointon discusses this point asking, \u2018Is \u201cFirst Love\u201d the love of the child for its mother or of the youth for the young woman?  If this is \u201cFirst Love\u201d what is second love?'\n\nThe painting is one of around 500 British oil paintings, watercolours and drawings which were donated to the Victoria & Albert Museum by John Sheepshanks (1784-1863) in 1857.",

Moved to Dublin 1797, London about 1799; encouraged by the Scottish painter John Graham and the sculptor Joseph Banks, entered RA Schools 1800 (won silver medal for drawing 1806). Pupil and assistant of John Varley, whose sister Elizabeth (also an artist) he married 1803 (separated 1810). Exhibited 78 works at the RA between 1804 and 1862, and five at the BI 1808-9 and 1826. Wide range of subjects in early years, including history and portraits, but by 1815 almost exclusively domestic subjects of precise detail and brilliant colour, and with Wilkie the most popular and admired artist in the genre. He noted his own goals as 'Story, Character, Expression, Beauty'. Elected ARA 1815, RA 1816. Many book illustrations; accomplished draughtsman, particularly perhaps of academic nude studies. Designed first penny postage envelope 1840. Elected member of many distinguished institutions at home and abroad. Died 7 July 1863; his studio sale was at Christie's 28-30 April 1864. His four sons Paul Augustus, William junior (see entry below), Michael (see entry above) and John were all trained as artists. Much manuscript and graphic material in National Art Library and V&A collections, also Tate Gallery. \nLIT: \tF G Stephens Memorials ofWilliam Mulready RA 1890; A Rorimer Drawings by William Mulready V&A exhibition catalogue 1972; K Heleniak William Mulready 1980; M Pointon Mulready V&A exhibition book and catalogue 1986. (The three last all have full bibliographies) \nThe most comprehensive recent catalogue raison\u00e9e of Mulready's works, arranged in chronological order, has been compiled by Kathryn Moore Heleniak, in her book William Mulready 1980, which provides the basis for the following entries. Her numbers have been quoted, and a brief resume given of her listing of alternative versions and related drawings. Further reference should be made to both her book and to Marcia Pointon's catalogue Mulready which accompanied the exhibition of 1986 held at the V&A, National Gallery, Dublin and Ulster Museum, Belfast; to Heleniak for more detailed comments on related works and documentation and Pointon for social commentary and aesthetic analysis. \n\nFirst Love \nFAl41 Neg 7854 \nCanvas, 76.9 \u00d7 61. 7 cm (30 \u00bd \u00d7 24 \u00bd  ins) \nHeleniak (150), who dates the work to 1838/9, records one related drawing in the Ashmolean, Oxford, three in the V&A, (6021, 6401, 6402) and two in the Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester. \nThe Art Union, 1840, p74 wrote: 'First Love is a delicious composition; a youth is whispering into the ear of as fair a maiden as was ever born of woman; she is too young to comprehend the meaning of the love-words that call the flush into her cheek and brow; the morning of their years and hopes is made to contrast happily with the rich sunlight of a departing day; and just at the moment when some answer must be made, forth rushes from the cottage the girl's mother and a noisy boy, with a summons to the supper table. It is a sweet story sweetly told; and negatives the assertion that a painter can preserve but one incident in a tale; what a volume of thought is produced by this single passage in a life!'\nMore prosaically W M Thackeray as Michaelangelo Titmarsh in Fraser's Magazine (June 1840, pp722, 726), broke into 'cod' German: 'but dat bigture of First Loaf by Herr Von Mulready ist wunderschon! Where in the while works of modern aertists will you find anything more exquisitely beautiful?'\n\nEight years later The Athenaeum on 10 June 1848 (p584) wrote: 'In 1839 Mr Mulready proved again that he could invest a subject drawn from scenes of humble life with the attributes of the highest walks of his art. A poetic spirit breathes through his presentment of First Love.'\n\nIn her entry in the 1986 catalogue Pointon points out the complex layers of meaning implicit in the painting's title: 'Is \"First Love\" the love of the child for its mother or of the youth for the young woman? If this is \"First Love\" what is second love?' \n\nEXH: \tRA 1840 (133); Society of Arts 1848 (XXII); William Mulready South Kensington Museum 1864 (81); Dublin, International Exhibition 1865 (44); William Mulready V&A 1986 (136) \n\nRonald Parkinson\"\n<u>Vikutoria & Arub?to Bijutsukan-z? : eikoku romanshugi kaigaten = The Romantic tradition in British painting, 1800-1950 : masterpieces from the Victoria and Albert Museum / selected by Mark Evans</u> [Japan : Brain Trust], 2002. 185 p. : ill.
