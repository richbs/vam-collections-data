The artist has used simple and minimal lines creating figures that appear somewhat stylised yet dynamic. The drawing reflects Keyt's commitment to support the revival of indigenous art forms. Kathak, which is one of the eight forms of Indian classical dances, originated from northern India. This dance form traces its origins to the the nomadic bards of ancient northern India, known as Kathaks, or story tellers. These bards, performing in village squares and temple courtyards, mostly specialized in recounting mythological and moral tales from the scriptures and embellished their recitals with hand gestures and facial expressions. Performers used theatrical and stylized gestures and musicians often played instruments and sang along, to enliven the stories.\n\nGeorge Keyt (1901\u20131993) was born in Sri Lanka (Ceylon). The ancient hill capital of Malwatte Vihareand with its Buddhist temples came to exercise a powerful and lasting influence on his artistic and literary output. Increasingly, the artist became greatly drawn towards Sri Lankan Buddhist philosophy, leading him to champion the Buddhist revival cause. This interest spurred the young painter to reject the Western cultural values he had been brought up with and explore both Hindu mythology and Indian literary works. \n\nTowards the end of his career, the artist assimilated Western elements into his visual vocabulary such as Picasso\u2019s cubism and Henri Matisse\u2019s painterly flatness to paint Hindu mythological figures.",

            "historical_context_note": "George Keyt (1901\u20131993) was born in Sri Lanka (Ceylon) and educated at Trinity College in Kandy, an elite colonial institution modelled after the British schooling system. As child of Indo-Dutch origins, Keyt practiced drawing, developing a keen interest in art history, Indian and Western literature. The ancient hill capital of Malwatte Vihareand with its Buddhist temples came to exercise a powerful and lasting influence on his artistic and literary output. Increasingly, the artist became greatly drawn towards Sri Lankan Buddhist philosophy, leading him to champion the Buddhist revival cause. This interest spurred the young painter to reject the Western cultural values he had been brought up with and explore both Hindu mythology and Indian literary works. \n\nBy studying Buddhist and Hindu philosophies, Keyt developed closer links to the indigenous culture and Indian way of life. Towards the end of his career, the artist assimilated Western elements into his visual vocabulary such as Picasso\u2019s cubism and Henri Matisse\u2019s painterly flatness to paint Hindu mythological figures. During the 1930s, the artist met the Indian polymath Rabindranath Tagore in Ceylon. This meeting left a lasting impression on the artist who renewed his commitment to revitalize Indian art and culture. \n\nKeyt is also considered to be one of the most influential Sri Lankan poets. His most notable literary contribution was the translation of the Gita Govinda into English and Sinhalese. Moreover the artist illustrated both works with elegant drawings. Keyt has been exhibited internationally. His work can be found in various museums and galleries abroad, as well as in private collections around the world.",
