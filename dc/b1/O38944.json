During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in the UK, modern languages such as French and Italian were part of a curriculum grouping described as \"accomplishments\", and considered most suitable for the education of girls. This grouping also included music and art; girls might additionally be taught some literature, history and geography, but it would be very unusual for them to have access to the subjects more typically taught to boys: Latin, Greek, grammar, mathematics, logic or astronomy.  Girls were also expected to learn domestic skills such as cooking and sewing.",
