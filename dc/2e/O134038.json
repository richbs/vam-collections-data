Studied at Sass's Academy from 1835; entered RA Schools. In a long, prolific, and highly successful career, exhibited 107 works at the RA between 1840 and 1906, 13 at the BI 1838-1857, and 12 at the Society of British Artists 1838-1883. Subjects predominantly literary, historical, and - most notably - scenes of contemporary life, with which he achieved his greatest popular fame, amplified by many engraved reproductions, beginning with <i>Ramsgate Sands</i> (exh RA 1854 and bought by Queen Victoria). In 1875 his <i>Dinner at Boswell's</i> ... of 1869 sold at Christie's for \u00a34567, the highest price ever achieved by a living artist. Member of 'The Clique' in the 1840s; elected ARA 1845, RA 1852. Died Sr John's Wood, London, 2 November 1909; there had been a studio sale at Christie's 14 June 1884. The <i>Art Journal</i> obituarist wrote: 'the artist will be missed: he was an institution'. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1856, pp237-40 (for other references to Frith in the <i>Art Union</i> and <i>Art Journal</i>, see the entry in C Wood <i>Dictionary of Victorian Painters</i> 1971); W P Frith <i>My Autobiography and Reminiscences</i> 3 vols 1887-8; <i>Times</i> 4 November 1909 (obit); <i>Art Journal</i>191O, p14 (obit); Mrs J Panton <i>Leaves from a Life</i> 1909, <i>More Leaves from a Life</i> 1911; W P <i>Frith</i> Whitechapel Art Gallery exhibition catalogue 1951; N Wallis <i>A Victorian Canvas</i> 1957; J Mass <i>Gambart: Prince of the Victorian art world</i> 1975; A Noakes <i>William Frith: Extraordinary Victorian Painter</i> 1978. \n\n<b>Scene from 'Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme': Monsieur Jourdain Receiving his Guests</b>\n537-1882 Neg L810 7 \nCanvas, 31. 7 x 55.9 cm (17\u00bd x 22 ins) \nSigned and dated 'W P Frith 1860' br \nJones Bequest 1882 \n\nA reduced replica of the painting exhibited at the RA in 1848 and now in the Harris Museum and Art Gallery, Preston (see <i>Versions</i>: below). Frith wrote: \n\nI received a hundred and sixty pounds for this picture, but at what price it was acquired by Mr Newsham, of Preston, I have no means of knowing. At the death of that gentleman the picture passed, with the whole of his fine collection, into the possession of the Corporation of Preston, as a free gift to the people of that town. At the South Kensington Museum there are small copies of the Moli\u00e8re pictures in the Jones Collection. \n\nFrith continues by relating the story of the model for the Marquise ('one of three sisters who were all favourite models at that time') who later married a nobleman. \n\nThe RA catalogue gives the title and accompanying quotation as follows: Scene from 'The Bourgeois Gentilhomme' \nMonsieur Jourdain, apr\u00e8s avoir fait deux rev\u00e9r\u00e9nces, se trouvent trop pr\u00e8s de Dorim\u00e8ne. \n<i>M Jourdain</i>: \tUn peu plus loin, Madame. \n<i>Dorimene</i>: \tComment? \n<i>M Jourdain</i>: \tUn pas, s'il vous plait. \n<i>Dorimene</i>: \tQuoi done? \n<i>M Jourdain</i>: \tReculez un peu pour la troisi\u00e8rne. \n\nThe scene is from the end of act 3 of Moli\u00e8re's play (first performed in 1670), in which the 'would-be gentleman', in his new clothes, tries out an elaborate series of bows of greeting to his aristocratic dinner guests. For Frith's earlier painting of the dining-room scene in act 4, see 538-1882 p105. \n\nThe <i>Art Union</i> critic wrote of the RA picture: 'In costume and character the figures are remarkable, and not less in drawing and solidity of painting'. It was also, interestingly, admired by Th\u00e9ophile Gautier at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1855: '11 est int\u00e9ressant de voir comment un Anglais comprend une sc\u00e8ne de Moli\u00e8re. - Il la comprend tr\u00e8s-bien, \u00e0 en juger par le tableau par M. Frith, qu'on croirait avoir vingt ans d'orchestre \u00e0 la Com\u00e9die-Francaise'. Of the setting, it is worth noting that the sculpture in the hallway is the much-reproduced classical marble of 'Cupid and Psyche' (Capitoline Museum, Rome). \n\nMoli\u00e8re's plays were popular as subjects for artists in England in the 19th century: see the entries in this catalogue for the paintings by W M Egley and C R Leslie, for example. Far more popular, it seems, than with theatre audiences; John Wood notes that 'in the nineteenth century romance and sentiment were supreme, and Moli\u00e8re was relegated to the school and the study. The recorded professional performances in English between 1850 and 1900 can be counted on the fingers of two hands' (<i>Five Plays</i> 1953, pxxv). \n\nFrith seems to have painted another pair of replicas, almost the same size, also in 1860, of the two 'Bourgeois Gentilhomme' scenes (see <i>Versions</i>: below). What may be other versions, but are simply described as scenes from the play, or scenes from Moli\u00e8re, are: Christie's (Thomas Creswick's sale) 6-7 May 1870 (364), bought Agnew's \u00a3241 10s; Christie's (Francis Broderip's sale) 10 February 1872 (668, dated 1860 and painted for Broderip), bought Addington \u00a3399; Christie's 26 April 1890 (81, from John Hunt collection, 30.5 x 38 cm (12 x 15 ins), signed and dated 1860), bought Innes \u00a352 10s; Christie's (Marquis de Santurce sale) 25 April 1891 (39, 29 x 30.5 cm (9 x 12 ins), bought Innes \u00a368 5s).
