Between his outstretched hands he holds a napkin containing six souls of the saved, shown as diminutive heads. The cross, bearing the bearded Christ, his head inclined to the left and wearing a loincloth and the torse, is between his knees.\n\nThe hands of God the Father appear to be later restorations in alabaster. The head of God the Father is missing. There is a dowel hole in the cross above Christ's head, doubtless to hold the Dove, although there is little space to contain it. The details of the figure of Christ are worn. No paint remains on the figures.\n\nA large amount of alabaster has been scooped out of the middle and bottom of the back of the figure. There are four holes, two plugged with lead.",

The large and heavy figure of God the Father is enthroned and wearing a gown with a cloak draped over his knees. Between his outstretched hands he holds a napkin containing six souls of the saved, shown as diminutive heads. The cross, bearing the bearded Christ, (God the Son) his head inclined to the left and wearing a loincloth and the torse, is between his knees. There is a dowel hole in the corss above Christ's head which propably originally held the Dove, symbolic of the Holy Spirit. \n\nThis carving is said to have been formerly in a church in Abergavenny.",
