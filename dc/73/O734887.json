Jacques Androuet Du Cerceau was one of the greatest architects in 16th-century France in the tradition of Sebastiano Serlio (1475-ca. 1554) and Andrea Palladio (1508-1580).

            "historical_context_note": "The drawing is laid down on the same sheet as E.534-1937 and 535-1937; the sheet is inscribed <i>12</i> in brown ink on the top right corner, suggesting that it was originally part of an album subsequently dismantled and which could have enclosed drawings of similar characteristics. \n\nOriginally acquired as an anonymous Italian design from the late 16th century, this drawing was subsequently identified as a copy after engravings by Jacques Androuet Du Cerceau. \n\nIn 1977, Janet Byrne identifies these two urn-shaped vases as plausible preparatory drawings for etchings by Jacques Androuet Du Cerceau, who was then copying two prints: a covered vase etching after Enea Vico, and another covered vase etching after Agostino Veneziano, both in the Metropolitan Museum, New York. However the V&A drawing is slightly different in details with the prints. She also noted that one of the striking differences between the Du Cerceau etchings and the Vico and Veneziano engravings is a matter of scale: the Du Cerceau prints are much smaller than the Italian models but of the same size of E.536-1937. The V&A drawing is in the same direction of the Du Cerceau print.\n\nProf Dr Peter Fuhring has pointed out (written communication, April 2012) that this drawing is not by Jacques Androuet Du Cerceau, though it has been attributed to him and occasionally published under his name. In fact the sheet was part of an album that is now dismantled and other sheets from it have appeared on the art market. All these drawings are copies in the same direction of the vases etched by Du Cerceau. Another drawing of the same series is also in the V&A: see E.534-1937.",
