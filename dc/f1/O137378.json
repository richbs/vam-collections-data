This semi-circular table incorporates a framed 'gate' that swings out from the main frame to support a folding leaf. (The right back leg consists of two elements, one of which swings out to support the folding top.)  It is clear that the hinged top is not original, and some aspects of construction are unusually crude in comparison with surviving  furniture from about 1600. One possiblity is that the folding top and gate were created as part of the elaborate restoration in about 1900 of a genuine, static, semi-circular side table. \n\nFolding tables are listed in English inventories from the 15th century but very few have survived from before 1600.",
