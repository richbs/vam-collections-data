Made of nylon, it wasn't made to be worn, but rather to be held up outstretched in the audience so that the band could see your adoration. This fashion came from the British phenomenon of having a scarf in your supported team's colours, and holding it up on the football terraces.\n\nBlack Sabbath were one of the most influential heavy metal bands of all time, helping to create the genre with ground breaking albums such as Paranoid. Their original sound focused on ominous lyrics and doomy music, in stark contrast to popular music of the early 1970s.",
