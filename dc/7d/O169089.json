            "physical_description": "Flat woven wool carpet. Bands of geometric decoration alternating with bands of solid blocks of colour mainly in red, brown, black and two shades of blue but with details in white cotton. Some green wool has faded to blue. The sides are finished with blue and red cord.\n\nWarp: White S spun wool, 8 threads to inch.\nWeft: Paired threads Z spun wool or cotton in the colours required by the pattern, approx. 15 shoots to inch.\n\nThe blocks of solid colour are joined in a regular kilim style with interlocking areas of colours. The elaborately patterned bands are made by a form of needle-weaving with long floats on the back so that each band appears to be raised.\n\nWARP: white wool; Z2S; thread counts vary from 8 per inch (31 per dm), in lower half to 11 per inch (39 per dm) in light red block in upper right; average would be 9 threads per inch (35 per dm).  Note: some warp increase can be seen in lower left hand part of band 1.\n\nWEFT: wool; 9 colours: red, light red, dark green, green, dark blue, blue, brown, black, white; z-spun, unplied but usually 2 threads have been passed together and given a slight S-twist; 34 weft threads per inch (132 per dm counted at 66 per 5 cms).\n\nSIDE FINISH: 3 cords but only the outer cord runs the full length of the carpet.  All 3 are overcast: the outer has a two-coloured diagonal of dark blue and red; the inner two have a chequered pattern, the middle one in light red and light blue, the inner one in black and brown.\n\nEND FINISH: Lower: cut but with max 1 cm of warp braiding and plaiting.  Above are three bands woven to correspond to the side cords, forming corners with the middle and inner cord.  Upper: three bands to correspond to the side cords, forming corners with the middle and inner cord.  After this comes 1 cm. plain weave first with dark red weft and then dark blue followed by 1 cm. of warp braiding from which three lengths only remain of the warp fringe, max. 11.5 cms.  The dark red and dark blue of the outer selvedge continue along the upper edge for 15 cms on the left and 9 cms on the righthand side.\n\nDESIGN: 15 main bands described from the lower plain weave area: \n(1) 7 bands of plain weave in black/brown/blue/red etc.\n(2) band of 10 interlocking blocks in all colours except white and green; the major junctions are in slit tapestry and the minor have weft floats.  The band is bordered first by reciprocal red/black trefoils and then by a narrow dark blue ground with small white stepped lozenges.\n\n(3) as (1)\n(4) dark blue ground with full-depth light red stars with dark blue tracery.  Band bordered on either side by dark blue ground containing white rectangles around a dark blue X-motif.\n(5) as (1)\n(6) with blocks as (2).  The outer reciprocal trefoils are green and red.  Beyond, bands in dark blue with small white motif.\n(7) as (1)\n(8) dark blue ground with three bands of small, light red rectangles, the central ones framed by red diamonds, hooked at top and bottom.  Band bordered by white stepped lozenges as in band (2).\n(9) as (1)\n(10) as (6)\n(11) as (1)\n(12) as (4)\n(13) as (1)\n(14) as (2)\n(15) as (1) but its two outer narrow bands have (1) reciprocal trefoil in red and dark blue and (b) the white motif as in (6) \nNote: the two outer bands of (1) are as (15) except that (a) is in red, brown and green.",
