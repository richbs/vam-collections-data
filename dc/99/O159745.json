In both dishes, the principal decoration consists of figures and the white-slipped flesh of the figures is left unpainted.\nA two-handled bowl (see La ceramica nel Veneto) was excavated in Legnago in 1947. It has the same orange-red largely cut-away background and the same intertwined border as on this V&A dish. It is dated mid to late 15th century and attibuted to Leganago.",
