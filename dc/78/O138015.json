Sk\u00e5ne province, in the extreme south of Sweden, has the richest tradition, and more jewellery was worn there than in any other district.   Almost all the Swedish traditional jewellery at the V&A comes from Sk\u00e5ne.  \n\nThe most popular necklace was a choker, made of several chains fastened at the front with a large decorative snap clasp.  These are often decorated with filigree and coloured pastes.  Swedish traditional jewellers made lavish use of coloured glass.  Red was the most popular colour, as everywhere in Europe.  These traditional necklaces often have a small pendent heart at the front.\n\nThe clasp on this necklace has a full set of Swedish silver marks.  It is marked with the Swedish 'cat's paw' standard mark, the three towers mark of Lund, the date letter U4, for 1850, and the maker's mark GD.  Gabriel Dahlberg was a silversmith who specialised in traditional jewellery, who worked in Lund from 1845 to 1893.",
