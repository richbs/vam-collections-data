Like The Caf\u00e9 de Paris it was a fashionable night-club and restaurant where one could dine and be entertained. The performers on this bill include The Crichton Lyrical, a five-piece band formed in 1921 consisting of Syd Roy, Harry Roy, Harold Lyons, Maurice Tronny, and Eddie Collis that played at the opening of the Caf\u00e9 de Paris in 1923. Although this poster is not dated, it must date from around 1924 when The Crichton Lyrical Band played there, and before 1925 when it was taken over by Robin Humphreys and Martin Poulsen and re-named The Caf\u00e9 Anglais. \n\nThe British-born ukulele player Sydney Nesbitt, second on the bill, lived much of his life in Canada but was popular in Britain in the 1920s, and in 1926 recorded the song Hey Mister have you met Rosie's sister? on the Parlophone label. The biggest star of the evening however was Tex McLeod, the American cowboy entertainer and star of Wild West shows who moved to England in 1919 and quickly became a headlining star in some of the country's most opulent night clubs and variety theatres.\n\nThe identical twenty-two year old twins, the dance act The Dolores Sisters, or the Dolores Twins, who also appeared in this cabaret kept this poster as a souvenir of the production.",
