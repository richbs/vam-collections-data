This <i>caitya</i> arch probably comprised the top portion of a false gable panel from a <i>stupa.</i> The two upper compartments of the relief, which are divided by a torus moulding with pointed leaf decoration, show the Buddha, in <i>dhayana mudra</i> with worshippers in the form of winged ichthyocentaurs with coiled tails.  In the bottom arched section  divided from the above two registers by a round-headed saw-tooth moulding, which is mirrored above by another pointed arched moulding, there is a standing haloed Buddha in <i>abhayamudra,</i>facing an ascetic dressed in a dhoti. This illustrates the rejection by the Buddha of orthodox Brahmanical teaching, represented by the sage who points to his leaf-hut at the left.  To the right stands Vajrapani, bearer of the adamantine thunderbolt. There are also the heads (the one to Buddha's left side being turbaned) and upper torsos of two men, which emerge from the back slab on either side behind Buddha, while another figure on the far right, possibly of a disciple dressed as a monk, is now only seen as a shadow, owing to the stone having been damaged.\n      The outer framing comprises two mouldings, the outside margin being decorated with curled-over leaf or petal motifs, while the inner, broader one has a running scroll of five-petalled rosettes.",
