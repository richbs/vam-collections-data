Young children are shown listening to records of Felix singing and performing on a piano and fiddle. This is apt since in 1923, in Great Britain, Felix was the subject of the Paul Whiteman song Felix Kept on Walking, one of the most popular records of the day.\n\nFelix debuted in 1919 as the silent star of short animated films. He was created by Otto Messner and the cartoons were produced by the studio of Pat Sullivan. His distinct personality, comic pantomiming and the surreal, \u2018magical\u2019 quality of the animation gave him international stardom.\n\nFelix\u2019s relationship with music stretches back to his first ever appearance, as Master Tom, in Feline Follies. In this film he serenades his love interest, Miss Kitty White, with a banjo. The musical notes he produces become wheels, attaching themselves to their tails which then become scooters, allowing the two lovers to go for a joyride.",
