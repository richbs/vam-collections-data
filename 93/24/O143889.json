He had been living in Srinagar as Director of the Technical Institute of Kashmir and wrote to the museum in 1922 offering to sell his collection before returning that year to the UK. All were acquired in Kashmir and were said to have come from the tomb of Madani near But Kadal in Srinagar, Kashmir.  The mid-fifteenth century monument was refurbished by a Mughal nobleman in the reign of Shah Jahan (1628-1658) with tiles from an unknown tile-making centre perhaps in the Mughal province of Panjab.",

He had been living in Srinagar where he had been Director of the Technical Institute of Kashmir and wrote to the museum in 1922 offering to sell his collection before he left that year to return to the UK.  The tiles are said to have come from the tomb of Madani near But Kadal in Srinagar, Kashmir.  The building dates from the mid-fifteenth century, but was refurbished by a Mughal nobleman in the reign of Shah Jahan (1628-1658).",
