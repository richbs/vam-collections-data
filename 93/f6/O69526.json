The addition of elaborate silver gilt mounts and a handle transformed it into a lidded tankard. In Europe, by the mid-seventeenth century, it had become popular practice to attach metal mounts to Chinese porcelain. Similar silver gilded mounts were produced in England during the late 16th century. On the collar of this piece is the stamped mark of an unknown silversmith. The same mark 'CW' appeared on a spoon with a London hallmark of 1669-1670. \n\nThis figurative scene of a man holding the reigns of two horses is in a free painting style that was characteristic of the porcelains produced during the 'Transitional period' (about 1620-83). This decoration reflects the preference for narrative scenes, generally taken from woodblock prints that illustrated popular novels and dramas.",
