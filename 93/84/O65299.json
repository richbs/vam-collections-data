The firm was set up by Max Gort-Barten in 1946 from a workshop on London's Old Kent Road. The first product was a toaster but the firm later diversified into kettles, coffee makers, corkscrews and grills.\n\nThe following is from the Dualit promotional brochure for 2002:\n\nThe Dualit Corkscrew is made to a unique patented design, blending simplicity of line with advanced engineering. The result is a combined foil cutter, crown top bottle opener forming the stand for the corkscrew, which removes corks swiftly and accurately with the minimum of effort. The two \u2018legs\u2019 of the Corkscrew fit easily and grip firmly over the bottle, allowing the cork-removing spiral to be readily centralised. Once engaged, simply wind the three-wing handle at the top and the cork will rise up the helix withdrawing the cork. Lift the corkscrew clear of the bottle and unwind for the cork to fallout. This ergonomically designed Corkscrew is made from solid metal and stands stable within its stand. It is available in matt chrome or stunning gold plate.",
