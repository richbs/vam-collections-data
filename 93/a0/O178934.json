Sniffed from the back of the hand, from pinched fingers or from a spoon, snuff was enjoyed on social occasions and would be placed on the table or passed around a group. Thousands of small portable boxes to contain the powder were made as personal accessories, often in novel designs, to be given as gifts.\n\nShoe- and boot-shaped snuff boxes were made throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. Shoes have long been associated with love and marriage and were often given for good luck. Snuff boxes were usually made of carved wood, but this shoe-shaped example is fashioned out of papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 and thickly coated with japanning. Decoration, in the form of buttons and stitching, is added in silver paint. The hollow at the top of the shoe would have contained the snuff, which was secured with a hinged lid. The small size and light-weight material of this box would have made it ideal for carrying on one's person. This box is one of a pair, which may have been given as keepsakes between friends or sweethearts.",
