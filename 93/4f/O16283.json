The figure was originally designed for a small wall fountain, most likely for the Villa at Careggi or one of the other Medici Villas. He would originally have held a whirligig which would have turned as it was hit by the water from the penis. Jet's of water would also have sprayed from the fish's mouth.\n\nThe figure is a putto or erote - in winged form with classicizing long hair, reminiscent of antique prototypes. The sculpture demonstrates the importance of antiquity informing the work of Donatello.",

It was bought from the Piot Collection sale (Paris, 1864, 25-30 April, No. 24, \u00a3160).\n\nHistorical significance: Until the object was cleaned, the putto was thought to be standing on a 'rocky base', but it proved to be a tortoise, one of the Medici emblems. The work is significant for the MRG context because it shows the relevance of antiquity for Donatello.  The putto - or erote - in its most classical, winged form seems to be the only one used by Donatello.  The naked figure stands in a contrapposto pose with his classicizing long hair, all reminiscent of antique prototypes, but transformed and made relevant to the Medici by the discreet addition of their emblem.",
