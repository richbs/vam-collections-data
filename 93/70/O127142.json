            "public_access_description": "This figure of a Chinese 'pagod' or idol is the central model of a table decoration group by the great modeller at the Nymphenburg porcelain factory, Franz Anton Bustelli.  Sixteen individual chinoiserie figures, including a priest and various children and adult attendants, some playing musical instruments or singing and others bowing down in worship, were designed by Bustelli to be positioned around this central figure, raised up on a tall plinth.\n\nBustelli's figure illustrates the continuing fascination with China in fashionable society. Oriental figures had been modelled by K\u00e4ndler at the influential Meissen porcelain factory from about 1740 onwards.  However, an interesting fresco in the Chinese pavilion (Pagodenburg) in the grounds of Nymphenburg castle, executed in by Johann Anton Gumpp in 1719, may have given Bustelli the idea for this integrated group.  It shows an idol figure seated on a towering pedestal surrounded by worshippers.",

Several musicians, having an upright posture, on small pedestals of grass were probably followed somewhat later by a temple scene with several figures, whose devoted-acting individual figures could be arranged on flat, cut-out plinths around an idol on a high pedestal.  Together with later additions that result from changes of already existing models, they were offered for sale as Temple of the Idols with 16 idolaters in the price list of 1767.'",
