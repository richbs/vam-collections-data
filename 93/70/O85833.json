No one has identified the coat of arms, which makes it difficult to assign it to a particular family estate or city.\n\nThe arms are described in heraldic terms as: Or, a double-headed eagle displayed sable; with an escutcheon of pretence, argent, a cross argent (on a gold ground, a black double-headed eagle with wings outspread; on the breast of the eagle a small shield with a white cross on a white ground).\n\nTwo knights support the arms. One holds a white banner with a white cross on it, repeating what is depicted in the escutcheon (small heraldic shield).\n\nThe roundel may come from the Deutschordenshaus (\u2018house of the Teutonic Knights\u2019) in the city of Gelnhausen. The Teutonic Order was founded as a hospital in the Holy Land, similar to the orders of the Templars and the Hospitallers. Its members devoted themselves to serving German pilgrims and Crusaders. \n\nIf this roundel does depict the arms of a member of the Teutonic Order, then it is possible that it was originally in a window in a meeting room or hall of the Deutschordenshaus.",

            "bibliography": "Williamson, Paul. <u>Medieval and Renaissance Stained Glass in the Victoria and Albert Museum. </u> London, 2003. ISBN 1851774041\nThis superbly drawn roundel shows two knights flanking a yellow shield with the imperial emblem of double-headed eagle in black with a small escutcheon of pretence with cross. The young knight on the left holds a banner, similarly decorated with a cross, and that on the right, with helm, holds a sword in his left hand. They stand before a diaper ground, scratched through a thin coat of dark enamel on ruby glass, the bottom third of which was restored, probably in the late nineteenth century.  It was recorded in the first half of the nineteenth century in Geluhausen east of Frankfurt, and because of the arms it is probable that the roundel came from the Deutschordenshaus (house of the Teutonic knights) there, probably decorating a window in a meeting room or hall. Like the St Peter roundel (no.49), it has been associated with the Housebook Master. Because of its original provenance and its relationship to other glass paintings from the Middle Rhine, it may have been made in a Mainz workshop, probably around 1480. From Gelnhausen the roundel passed to the Schloss Mainberg at Schweinfurl until 1901, then to the von Hollitscher (Berlin) and Noll (Frankfurt) collections until 193]. It was bought by the American media magnate William Randolph Hearst, but was sold again a few years later and purchased by the Museum in 1938 from the London dealer Wilfred Drake.\nH. Schmitz, Die Glasgemalde des koniglichen Kinstgewerbemuseums in Berlin. Mit einer Einfuhrung in die Geschichte der deutschen Glasmalerei, Berlin, 1913.\nabb.189 & p.112 Says it is from the Cathedral of Gelnhausen in Hess. The roundel passed into the collection in the castle in Mainberg into the possession of Herr von Hollitscher in Berlin and then into the collection of William Randolph Hearst.\nR.
