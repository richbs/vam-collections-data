            "public_access_description": "These four textile samples were used for a set of curtains said to be part of a mid-19th century redecoration scheme for Windsor Castle, Berkshire. The green ribbed silk was used for the main body of the curtains. The figured silk ribbon in green and white was used to trim the vertical edges of the curtains and the green silk fringe for other edges. The shinier green silk taffeta was employed for lining the curtains. \n\nA handwritten label originally attached to one of the samples states 'Supplied to Queen Victoria for curtains at Windsor Castle'. The donor of these samples, John Fowler (1906-1977) of the London interior decorating firm of Colefax & Fowler, worked on schemes for royal palaces. He was acquainted with the Master of the Royal Household and collected many historic samples for reference. Though he never worked on a scheme for Windsor there is good supporting evidence that these samples were intended for this royal residence. \n\nThe ribbon features strong nationalistic motifs - the rose of England, the thistle of Scotland and the shamrock of Ireland. These combine to create a suitable design for a royal palace. Two silk-weaving firms, Norris & Co. and Daniel Walters & Sons, both of Spitalfields, London, are known to have produced silks for Windsor Castle. It is likely that one of these firms manufactured the patterned furnishings.",
