The text is as follows: <i>school of</i> VERONESE, PAOLO 413 <i>Recto</i> A seated faun with is right arm raised Inscribed along the right edge in a later hand 'Paolo Veronese' Pen and ink Size of sheet 16 x 6 5/8 (406 x 168) 4462 <i>Verso</i> Design for a frieze round the top of a room with Apollo and Hyacinthus in the middle, flanked by two fauns serving as caryatids, two female busts and other ornamental motifs Pen and ink and wash PROVENANCE Sir P. Lely (Lugt 2092; on the verso); J. Talman (see the gold border on verso, as in Lugt 2462); bought 1865 The old attribution to Veronese is to some extent justified by the design on the verso, which is close to him, though probably not by him. The study of a faun on the recto is less like him, but it is somewhat similar, in the penwork, to a well known drawing of two seated fauns in Mr Curtis O. Baer's collection. Mr Baer's drawing has been much discussed and variously attributed to Titian, to Domenico Campagnola, to Dosso Dossi and to the young Sebastiano del Piombo. The question has never been satisfactorily decided. The most recent discussion of it (with a bibliography) is in Jacob Bean and Felice Stampfle, Drawings [rom New York Collections: I. The Italian Renaissance, Metropolitan Museum of Art and Pierpont Morgan Library, New York, 1966, p. 45, no. 59. A curious feature of the Victoria and Albert drawing is the gnarled hands and feet of the faun.",
