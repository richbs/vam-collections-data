In doing so, he laid the foundations of modern photography. Calvert Jones learned of these developments in 1839 through a neighbour who was a cousin of Talbot. Jones lived in South Wales and he made many photographs there and in the West of England. He also travelled widely, making photographs on the continent. Jones' work stands out in the early development of photography because he was one of the first to apply a schooled artist's eye to the medium.\n\nIn 1853, Jones moved to Belgium. Although this photograph is dominated by a foreground building, it is probably a record of Notre-Dame du Sablon, which is considered to be one of the most beautiful of the gothic churches in Brussels.The entrance porch and rose window occupy the centre of the composition and the roof of the church extends to the side of the photograph. When Jones took his photograph, it was still surrounded by houses.",

They were demolished as part of one of  Leopold II urbanisation projects.",
