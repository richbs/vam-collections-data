At first, women collected and wore the magnificent crosses which were part of traditional dress in many towns, but they also wanted other pieces of jewellery to match, such as earrings, buttons, bracelets and belts.  These had never been part of traditional dress in Normandy.  To fulfil this demand, many French silversmiths started to make this additional jewellery using the same moulds which were used for making the traditional Normandy croix bosses.  Not to be outdone, British silversmiths, particularly in Birmingham, also started to make jewellery in the Normandy style, although theirs is not always as close to the original as that produced in France.\n\nWhen the museum acquired these buttons in 1925 they were described as \u2018copied from a Normandy design\u2019, but they are not very similar to buttons made with authentic moulds.",
