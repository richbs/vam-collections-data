The top of the plant has a cluster of pale green leaves and three flower buds.  The tier below has a full head of orange flowers and leaves, below which there are more pinnate leaves springing from the stem.  The flowers and leaves are both shaded in a darker tone in fine lines of brushwork.  The plant is shown against an ivory-coloured plain ground.\n      It is framed with strips of buff-coloured paper with black ruled lines on either side of gold lines, the outer one being broader than the inner one.  The main border is a plain ivory colour with its margins embellished with strips of paper in a yellowish buff colour outlined on the inner edge with a double black outline.  The left hand margin has been abraded and a strip of beige textile stuck to it as a gutter for the present album binding.",

It contains 56 leaves on which are Mughal miniature paintings, drawing and flower studies on both sides. The binding is covered with an Indian brocade silk that may have been cut from lengths brought home by the 2nd Lord Clive, who served as Governor of Madras, 1799 to 1803.  The album was sold from Powis Castle at Sotheby's sale, 16 to 18 January 1956, lot 332A.",
