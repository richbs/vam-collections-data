The field is undecorated. A narrow column of the blue and yellow chevron pattern is on either side; is comes from a stepped column base and terminates in a line of blue and red architectural forms.  This edges a white band with blue, red and purple flower heads on a green leafy meander which, in an expanded form, continues to fill the spandrels.  At the top is a central rectangle in blue and two shades of red encloses a white cartouche decorated with floral elements.  Three sides of the central panel is edged with a narrow yellow band [a] with a tiny red and blue meander and then with a wider band in white with a green lattice enclosing small purple flower heads.  Band [a] is repeated. A narrow band [b] is red and a light red meandering pattern. Band [a] is repeated and this frames a line of oblongs with two types of cypress tree, mainly blue on a white ground within a blue arched form.  Across the top of the central panel these oblongs are repeated in blocks of five and six; the innermost on the right hand side is incompletely printed. At the side is a repeat of [a] and [b] with an outermost band in a column format with a blue base and a light blue band with a dark blue meander and red and white flower heads.  This band terminates abruptly at the top in a line of architectural elements in blue and red and a series of domes and spiky finials in red, blue, purple and yellow. Along the bottom is a reciprocal trefoil in blue and white, then a narrow band with a blue meander and 4-petalled purple flower heads on a yellow ground.  These are either side of a deep white band with lobed zigzag of blue leaves enclosing two types of large red blossoms and small purple irises.\nThe quilting is worked with silk thread through an undecorated plain weave cotton backing and through the facing; there a padding of cotton fibres.  The quilting is worked in diagonal lines around a central diamond.\nDecorative Backing: Made from at least three pieces.  White ground, roller printed, plain weave cotton decorated with a narrow boteh in off set rows connected with ribbon-like swags against a dense floral pattern in blue and two shades of brown.\nFacing: bias-cut plain weave cotton, block printed with a small floral motif in red, blue and purple in off set  rows on a white ground.",
