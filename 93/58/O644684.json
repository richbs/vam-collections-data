Those shaded on the left seem to be the designs done by Birckenhultz as they are marked \u201cPBF\u201d at the bottom, which stands for Paulus Birckenhultz Fecit (Paul Birckenhultz made this). Those shaded on the right, though apparently part of the same series are marked \u201cP.B.In.\u201d standing for Paulus Birckenhultz Invenit (Paul Birckenhultz designed or invented this), suggesting that these designs were copied later from Brickenhultz\u2019s original designs, accounting for the reversed designs and for the \u201cinvenit\u201d inscription, which Birckenhultz himself never used.
