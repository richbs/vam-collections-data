Potters used the lustre technique to make their wares shine like gold.\n\nFirst a glazed vessel or tile with little or no decoration was made in the normal way. When the piece had cooled, a design was painted over the glaze in metallic compounds. The pot or tile was then fired again, this time with a restricted supply of oxygen. In these conditions, the metallic compounds broke down, and a thin deposit of copper or silver was left on the surface of the glaze. When polished, this surface layer reflected the light.\n\nThe lustre technique was introduced to Spain from Egypt as early as the 12th century. In the 13th century, Muslim-ruled M\u00e1laga was the main centre of production, but in the 14th century, Christian-ruled Valencia took over. Potters there continued to use Islamic designs, such as the bands resembling Arabic calligraphy on this jar.",
