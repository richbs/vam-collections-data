The design, entitled 'Perino', shows a head with hair and a beard made of leaves, surrounded by foliage and scrollwork, typical of the so-called 'grotesque' style, a type of ancient Roman decoration rediscovered during the Renaissance.  \n\nIn 1856 Owen Jones's the Grammar of Ornament was published, an analysis of patterns and colours from many periods and cultures. The book became an invaluable source for designers who, like Jones, believed that reproducing flowers and similar objects in a naturalistic way was in bad taste and who preferred to employ stylised motifs.",
