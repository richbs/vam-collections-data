The creature on the right appears to be some sort of wingless bird, with a long beak. The mammal-like figure on the left has a rounded mouth and large eyes. Both creatures face inward toward the eagle.",

They had no religious function but gave some support to the monks and clergy in the long parts of the services when standing was required. This explains the name 'misericord', which comes from the Latin for mercy. The decoration was often amusing, sometimes moral, and included grotesque figures and observations of the natural world in depictions of animals, birds and foliage.\n\nThis misericord is decorated with a carving of an eagle holding a blank scroll in its beak. An eagle is the attribute of St. John the Evangelist, and the carving may have been intended to be a representation of this.  \n\nThis misericord was probably carved in East Anglia, but we do not know which church it came from.",

Remnant \u2013 in <i>A Catalogue of Misericords in Great Britain</i>, Oxford, 1969 \u2013 pointed out the differences in design in the seats.  \n\nIt is now thought the misericords divide into two groups: one of six (W.6,9 to 12 and 54-1921), which are still believed to be from St Nicholas and one of four (W.7,8,52 and 53-1921) which, while possibly still from East Anglia, are not now thought to be from St Nicholas.

            "historical_context_note": "Misericord is the name given to the ledge supported by a corbel which is revealed when the hinged seats in medieval choir stalls are tipped up. The word comes from the Latin <i>misericordia</i> which means pity and alludes to the original function of the ledge.  \n\nThe rule of St Benedict, introduced in the sixth century AD, required the monks to sing the eight daily offices of the Church (Matins, Lauds, Prime, Terce, Sext, Nones, Vespers and Compline) standing up.  They were only permitted to sit during the Epistle and Gradual at Mass and the Response at Vespers.  Such long hours spent standing was particularly arduous for the older and weaker monks and they soon adopted a leaning staff or crutch to help take the weight off their feet.  \n\nBy the eleventh century the rules were slightly relaxed and misericords were introduced \u2013 the monks were able to perch on the ledge and lean back slightly, taking much of the weight off their feet whilst still giving the appearance of standing up straight.  They were in use wherever the monks were required to sing the daily offices, including cathedrals, abbeys and collegiate churches.  They sometimes even appeared in Parish churches.\n\nThe earliest mention of misericords appears in the eleventh century in the rules of the monastery of Hirsau in Germany.  It is not known when they were introduced in Britain but the earliest surviving examples are found at Hemingbrough in North Yorkshire and Christchurch in Dorset.  Both date from the early thirteenth century.  The earliest complete set of misericords is in Exeter Cathedral and dates from 1240 to 1270.\n\nThe choir seat, the ledge and the corbel supporting it were made of a single piece of wood, usually oak.  The corbel provided an ideal platform for medieval craftsmen to carve all manner of narrative scenes and decoration.  British misericords differ from those elsewhere in Europe by having subsidiary carvings on either side of the central corbel.  These are known as supporters and are often used to develop the theme introduced in the carving of the corbel.  \n\nOver half of the misericords in Britain are decorated with foliage but of those which do have narrative decoration, both in Britain and on the Continent, very few depict religious subjects.  More common themes included scenes of everyday life and moral tales, often being depicted in a humerous way.\n\nWhether, as has been suggested, the lack of religious scenes was because the hidden location of the misericords meant craftsmen were more free to be creative with their carving, or whether the monks would have thought it inappropriate to sit on images of Christ, Saints or biblical scenes is not known.  However, their lack of overt religious content together with their concealed physical position probably contributed to a large number of them surviving the Reformation and still existing today.\n\nInformation taken mainly from: \n<i>Church Misericords and Bench Ends</i>, Richard Hayman, Shire Publications, Buckinghamshire, 1989 (no copy in the NAL)\n<i>The World Upside-Down \u2013 English Misericords</i>, Christa Gr\u00f6ssinger, London, 1997\n(NAL = 273.H.95)",
