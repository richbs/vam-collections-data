His paintings were very popular, particularly with an urban audience who wanted to believe in the idea of  a countryside inhabited by people who were happy and contented with their work. In reality, the 19th century was a time of hardship for agricultural workers and their families.",

It can be found in Shakespeare's plays, George Morland's paintings, the bawdyness of 18th-century ballads, and the tragic inevitability of the fate of Thomas Hardy's heroine Tess of the D'Urbervilles. Birket Foster's milkmaid, his most famous composition, serene in her rustic vigour and comeliness, occupies an important place in this tradition, and served for the Victorian urban public as a potent and nostalgic visual reminder of their rural roots. \n\nBirket Foster's immense contemporary popularity as a water-colour painter is one of the most interesting aspects of Victorian art. He enjoyed the somewhat dubious distinction of being one of the most extensively copied of all Victorian artists. His works were duplicated with loving enthusiasm by generations of emulative artists who sought to capture the secret of his infallible formula of pretty girls or children and domestic animals portrayed in peaceful landscapes reminiscent of Constable's paintings. Inevitably over the years, many of these copies have gained fraudulent signatures, and are now passed off as genuine works. But where they fail, and where Foster succeeded, was in the surprising power of his underlying life drawing, and the vigorous freedom of his landscape sketches, concealed by his elaborately stippled water-colour technique.\n\nLionel Lambourne\"",
