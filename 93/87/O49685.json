There are clumps of brown thread sewn onto the face perhaps to denote whiskers. There is a short tail which forms part of the whole body. A white label with printed black text is sewn into the bottom seam. There is an embroidered design of a dog's head and paws resting on a bone outline with the letters PP in red inside. The stuffing is very soft.",
