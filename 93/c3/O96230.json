The depth of the turned wood border would protect the gesso portrait within during use. Games of skill such as chess and draughts with their chivalric and military associations had deep roots in patrician leisure, and Luxury boards and games-pieces became common possesions amongst the elite of Renaissance Europe.\nCharles is depicted with the Order of the Golden Fleece: the badge of the Order can be seen suspended as a pendant on his chest.",

            "historical_context_note": "This wooden medallion was almost certainly used as a games-piece. The depth of the turned wood border would protect the gesso portrait within during use. Games of skill such as chess and draughts with their chivalric and military associations had deep roots in patrician leisure, and Luxury boards and games-pieces became common possesions amongst the elite of Renaissance Europe. Probably produced in series, sets of such games- pieces comprised of perhaps thirty-two pieces, which have subsequently been split up and in part lost. It is likely that they were made in Augsburg in the mid-sixteenth century, copied from slightly earlier medals by Freidrich Hagenauer and others. Emminent personages such as Charles V or his brother Ferdinand are usually portrayed on this type of games-piece.\n\nHere Charles is depicted with the Order of the Golden Fleece: the badge of the Order can be seen suspended as a pendant on his chest. Modelled on the English Order of the Garter, the Order of the Golden Fleece was restricted to a limited number of knights, initially 24 but increased to 30 in 1433 and 51 in 1516. The order was explicitly denied to \"heretics\", and so became an exclusively Catholic award during the Reformation, though the choice of the pagan Golden Fleece of Colchis as the symbol of a Christian order caused some controversy.",
