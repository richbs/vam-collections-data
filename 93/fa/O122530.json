It is made of an industrial synthetic material which has been treated as if it were a craft material.  The back and sides of the chair are made of a single sheet of pliable polyurethane resin which has been poured into a mould.  The colours and details of each chair are unique, although the overall dimensions and shape can be made serially.  Bright colours are characteristic of all Pesce's designs, not only in his children's furniture. The chair also demonstrates Pesce's interest in the symbolic value of furniture.  The seat is actually the profile of a head, and another smiling face is suggested by the holes that pierce the chair's back. Many of  Pesce's designs for furniture and interiors have anthropomorphic qualities. He made adult and children's Crosby chairs, which were named after the location of his workshop.",
