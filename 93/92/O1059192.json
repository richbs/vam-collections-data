Full citation:\n\n\u201c<b>121 Unknown Man</b>\n<b>1663</b> \nEvans 22 \n\n<b>Oval 62 x 50mm</b> \n\nFeatures in long, sloping hatches of brown and sanguine, with shadowing in blue-grey and black, with touches of white in the eyes, on a yellowish carnation ground; hair in brown wash, hatched and lined with darker colour and with the lights in opaque pale brown and grey; cravat in white over grey wash; robe in dark grey wash with black and white heightening; background to the left an opaque dark brown wash and to the right a sky in opaque blue, ochre and grey washes; a rudimentary landscape with a tree in off-white lower right; a gold marginal strip; on vellum put down on a leaf from a table-book. \n\n<b>Condition:</b> Excellent. \n\n<b>Signed:</b> Lower centre right, in gold: <i>TP</i> (see D in Appendix 2) and dated 1663. <b>Inscribed</b> in lead-point on the back: <i>Begun on Shrove/Teusday [sic] 1663./TP/ [flourish]/ London / finish't Marsh[ sic]. 1. [flourish] / 1663.</i> The inscription repeats a similar one in silver-point below it: <i>Begun on Shrove - /Teusd / 16</i>; truncated presumably when the card was trimmed to the oval for sending to the goldsmith for its locket. \n\n<b>Frame:</b> Seventeenth-century oval gold locket, the back convex and the sides with a broad channel flaring to the bezel, which holds the slightly convex bevelled glass; the hanger of D- section, deeply channelled in the centre, bifurcating into diminishing spirals of flat wire of three turns; engraved on the back below the hanger with scroll ornament. There seems to be an inscription <i>inside</i> the hanger: Mr [flourish] F\u2019s. \n\n</b><b>Provenance:</b> Acquired by the Hon. F H A Wallop from an unrecorded source before 1927; lent to the V&A 1927-49; the ownership transferred to Alan Evans, June 1933 and by him bequeathed in 1974 to the National Gallery; placed on indeterminate loan at theV&A. (See Appendix 3.) \n\n<b>Exhibited:</b> Grosvenor Place 1932; RA 1934, no. 1011. \n\n<b>Literature:</b> Long 1929, p. 155 ('one of them, Signed and dated 1663, is a particularly good example'); <i>Summary Catalogue</i>1981, p. 22. \n\nOn the attitude of Long, and others, to Flatman's skill as a miniaturist, see Cat. No. 118. \n\nThe scratched note inside the hanger suggests that the locket was made to order from 'Mr F', or at least that, if it were a stock item, it had been specifically selected by him.\u201d",
