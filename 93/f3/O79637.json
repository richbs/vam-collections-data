In the Syrian region, which incorporated much of Palestine, Jordan and Lebanon as well as Syria itself in the 19th century, they were worn by all sections of society, from townswomen to the nomadic Bedouin of the desert.  The designs vary by sector and show influences from a wide area, reflecting Syria\u2019s strong trading traditions and central location.\n\nHinged bracelets like these were more common among the settled urban and rural population.  The use of a red paste on one and a green on the other is characteristic of Syrian traditional jewellery.  They were bought for five shillings and sixpence (the pair) at the International Exhibition, London, in 1872.  Their name was recorded as \u2018ussuar\u2019, which is a generic Arabic name for bracelets in the region.",
