The Spanish born couturier Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga (1895-1972), \u2018the Master\u2019 to his fellow couture designers, had moved to Paris from Spain in 1937. By 1952 he had 232 employees and his house produced 356 new designs per year. His clients, admitted to his salon only after a personal introduction, included many cosmopolitan women of different nationalities. Some dressed exclusively in his clothes.   \n\nBalenciaga was a perfectionist in all aspects of cutting, sewing and finishing of garments.  This evening coat typifies the superb cut and increasingly monastic simplicity of his designs in the late 1950s and into the 1960s. Its only accent is the large glittering jet button. The shapes of such garments owed much to his knowledge of ecclesiastical vestments.",
