Pulchinella, as he was then called, was presented within a tent rather than in the type of booth we know today. Pepys brought his wife to see the show two weeks later and that October the same show was performed at Whitehall for the King. \n\nJoey the Clown brings the tin to Mr. Punch and says it contains his supper. Mr. Punch takes the lid off, looks inside and says it's empty. Joey says he guarantees his supper will be there after they sing 'Here we go round the mulberry bush'. After the song the sausages appear when the identical lid at the other end is removed. because Joey has turned the tin upside down.",
