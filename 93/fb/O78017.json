In church, the flagon replenished the communion cups or chalices. This flagon, with a matching chalice, was among the church plate exhibited by the church furnishing firm of Cox & Son at the International Exhibition of 1871. The previous year the company had won a prize at a Society of Arts competition for art-workmanship when it showed communion services. The flagon may have been made for this competition.\n\nPeople\nThis flagon was probably designed by the architect George Goldie ( 1828-1887 ). His London architectural practice, Goldie & Child, was responsible for the design of many new Roman Catholic churches including the Church of the Assumption in Kensington Square.\n\nTime\nReligious revivalism in Victorian England which sought to reinstate the ceremonial aspect of services in Anglican churches and the growth of Roman Catholicism led by propagandists such as the architect, A.W.N. Pugin, increased the demand for church furnishings. By 1870 the catalogue of Cox & Son, who made this flagon, claimed to be able to supply 800 designs of furniture, Gothic metalwork, carpets and hangings by 'eminent church designers'. The flagon, advertised in a later catalogue, cost 75 guineas and was one of the most expensive items for sale.",
