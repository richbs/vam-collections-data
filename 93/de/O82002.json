No. 12 [James II, Louis XIV, the 'Jewel-Office' in Paris (see below); in 1801 presented by George, 2nd Earl  Spencer (1758-1834) to James Edwards (1756-1816), who left and account of the circumstances with the  miniatures to his son, the Revd E J Edwards: \n\t \nAbout the year 1801, General - came to England to negotiate a treaty of peace with this nation; there was some secret our  Government wished to gain private information of which could only be obtained through a private French family (name forgotten).  Mr.  Edwards\u2026was breakfasting with Lord Spencer, then First Lord of the Admiralty, when this was mentioned.  Mr Edwards was  personally acquainted with this family, and told Lord Spencer that he could learn anything from them that he was desirous to know.   Shortly after, Lord Spencer asked Mr Edwards to go over to Paris (promising him a safe conduct) to ascertain the particulars that the  Government required.  Having satisfactorily performed the business, he returned, and thought no more of it till six weeks after, he  received a letter enclosing a draft from the Treasury for \u00a3500.  Not understanding why this was presented to him, he took it to Lord  Spencer, who said it was the usual payment for such a mission.  Mr Edwards, not having anything to do with diplomacy, declined  accepting it, having undertaken the negotiation as an act of private friendship to Lord Spencer.  \n\t \nShortly after, Lord Spencer told Mr Edwards that he had something to offer him which he could not withstand thought he refused the  money, for he had heard from the agents of the French Government that some of the neglected treasures of the Jewel-Office in Paris  were to be sent to this country.  So little was known of their value that these Stuart miniatures lay disregarded among the old chains  and ornaments of this collection, which was accompanied with a written document, stating that James II had brought them over from  England, and had deposited them with Louis XIV when he went to St. Germains, intending to reclaim them on his return .

On his brother\u2019s accession as Elector in 1610, he assumed the minor family title of Duke of Simeren (Simmern), and committed himself irrevocably to his brother\u2019s cause when, in 1619, he accompanied Frederick and Elizabeth to Prague to claim the crown of Bohemia.  Like Frederick he lost all in the debacle of the family ambitions, and joined Elizabeth and Frederick at The Hague in 1621.  This portrait, which dates on costume and style to the early 1620a, must belong to the same group of \u2018Bohemian\u2019 propaganda portraits as the slightly later <i>Elizabeth</i> images (Cat. Nos. 10, 11 and 12 [Dyce 88; P.2-1917; P.27-1975]).  Like the last it has the archaising \u2018Elizabethan\u2019 solid blue background. \n \nPortraits of Ludwig are rare and, as a subsidiary figure in British/European history, he has been omitted from the national iconographies.  Like Charles Louis and Rupert, sons of Elizabeth in the next generation, however, Frederick V and Ludwig seem to have looked very much like one another.  Probably some of the Frederick images are actually of his younger brother.  This miniature provides a touchstone.\u201d",
