The leg components are fixed front to back so that one forms the two left hand legs and one the two right hand legs. The legs taper slightly towards their lower ends and terminate in brass cups. These cups consist of six narrow leaves with points upwards, their lower ends curve together to form a small brass ball which makes contact with the floor. The front seat rail consists of a single rectangular strip of mahogany joined by a mortise and tenon joint to the side rails. The back seat rail is also of rectangular shape but set at an angle of about 30 degrees to the horizontal across its section. The method by which this rail is joined to the side rails is invisible but the probable method is by a blind mortise and tenon joint at each end. The side seat rails are fashioned from four rectangular strips of mahogany laminated together, they curve upwards from the horizontal to the v vertical planeto from the sides of the back. The seat itself is of woven cane which though of some age is unlikely to be contemporary with the chair. There is a strengthening bar across and beneath the seat, it runs between the tops of the legs. The front uprights of the arms are of five strips of mahogany laminated together then formed into a tapering rod of circular section. Their narrow ends are fixed horizontally on the side seat rails, they curve upwards into the vertical plane, their upper ends have a carved collar of acanthus leaves. Above the point where the end of each arm upright joins the arm is placed a wooden sphere. The arms consist of four rectangular pieces of mahogany laminated together. They are horizontal along most of their length but curve upwards towards their rear ends to join the side rails of the back. The top rail of the back consists of an approximately 30 degree annular segment of mahogany slightly curved in the vertical plane. The two pieces of wood from which it is made are joined horizontally.",

That paint has been removed, and with it the paint that would originally have decorated the chair. The removal of the original paint is unfortunate, but it does allow us to see how the curved legs are each made of several layers of mahogany. The layers were laminated together and then bent with the use of steam. This technique was taken up and fully exploited by the Thonet firm in Germany after 1830. In the second half of the 19th century bentwood furniture became highly popular. The use of laminated wood has enabled the legs to be made very slender, and indeed the whole chair is very light.\n\nThe chair was made by the firm of Chapuis, who traded in Brussels. They made many versions of this chair, with different painted decoration. The form is based on a design first made in Paris about ten years earlier by the firm of Jacob Fr\u00e8res.",
