The kaleidoscope of stitches in bright primary colours emphasises its hand-crafted appeal, and the striking patchwork effect is achieved by alternating blocks of stocking and fancy stitches.\n \nThe designer, Patricia Roberts, set up a hand-knitting business in 1976 and still runs a shop in London today. She has published many pattern books and issued ranges of luxury yarn. This cardigan is typical of her innovative designs in bold colours using contrasting textures and decorative stitches.\n\nRelated items by Patricia Roberts are a pair of multi-coloured gloves (T.63:1-2013 and T.63:2-2013) and a beret (T.62-2013).",
