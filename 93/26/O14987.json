Until 1867 she exhibited under her maiden name of Miss Edith Dunn, and from 1870 under her married name, Mrs T.O. Hume. \n\nHume has not presented this group of fisher girls in the picturesque fancy dress preferred by contemporaries such as Miles Birkett Foster and Helen Allingham in their studies of rural workers. They are shown in the real dress of women of their class and occupation. Nevertheless the three girls are shown as healthy, industrious and respectable representatives of the rural labouring classes.\n\nThis painting was bequeathed to the V&A by Joshua Dixon (1811-1885), a successful cotton merchant. In addition to oil paintings, watercolours and drawings, his collection also included engravings, Japanese vases and panels, and bronze and marble sculpture. Born in Dalston, north-east London, Dixon died on his estate of Winslade Park in Somerset and left his collection initially to the Bethnal Green Museum, which is part of the V&A, for the 'benefit of the people of East London.'",
