The column and fingers are reminiscent of a glove, the base of which is open to reveal an interior decorated with foliage. There is flowering foliage on either side of the glove shape and a thin branch bearing fruit lying across it. There is a vertical band next to the glove shape on the right. The design is short and smaller than the page on which it is pasted. It does not therefore have a folded section unlike many of the other designs in the album.\n\nThe design is squared up for cords and dezines in pencil, with dezines numbered in ink.",

A constant supply of fashionable new designs from which to create new lines was required, so patternmakers and master weavers like James Leman supplied a wide range of designs for different weavers. The album contains some of his work from the period 1706-1716, as well as five designs from the 1730s.\n\nJames Leman was born in 1688 into a weaving family of Huguenot descent. In 1702 he was apprenticed to his father, Peter, and lived with his family in Stewart Street, Spitalfields in London. Leman's inscription on the design reveals that it was commissioned by Mr Tullie, a mercer who was an important customer of Leman's who bought 25 silks, mostly the more expensive kinds, between 1708 and 1721.",
