They were usually attached with tiny screws.\n\nPeople\nThe firm of Cope & Timmins was formed by the amalgamation of two earlier firms, Cope & Collinson and Clarke & Timmins, in 1800. Both firms were brass-founders, meaning that they specialised in brass products, and had factories in Birmingham, the renowned centre of brass manufacturing, as well as premises in London. Brass-founders produced a wide range of goods, including castors, hinges, handles, lock plates and curtain fittings, as well as decorative furniture mounts.\n\nTime\nThe enormous popularity of historic revivals in the period 1800-1840 resulted in a corresponding demand for a range of designs for decorative brass mounts. Manufacturers borrowed freely from one other, and many of the same patterns remained popular, being reproduced over many years, like this mount.",
