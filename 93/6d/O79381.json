No evidence of a cord.\nEnd Finish is missing.\nDesign: Dark red ground with a central row of small blossoms and palmettes and 2 half rows down each side. Ther are 2 intermediate rows of larger blossoms; in each there is a single below and above the centre and a vertical pair at the centre, all with a dark blue scalloped outline. From the base of each blossom extends a pair of sprays of small white flowerheads-these loop together in the central part of each row. Below the lowest blossom and above the highest extend long, graceful saz leaves and blossoms. Towards the top of the field this design squashed.\nMain Border: dark red ground with dark blue cartouches alternating with circles. Each cartouche contains a central light blue rosette from which extend a pair of dark red composite blossoms and leaves. The elaborate white cloudband frame around the cartouches continue to encircle both a smaller circular flower and the large dark blue circular rosette, which lies on the other side of it. The small circle lies between 2 half rosettes at the edges of the main border. The upper main border is squashed.\nInner and Outer borders: Green ground with floral meander of alternating dark blue and dark red rosettes on dark blue stem.\nGuardstripes: reciprocal pattern in dark red/dark blue outlined in white.",
