This model appears in the 1947 Utility Furniture Catalogue as one of two designs of dressing table in the Chiltern range. They were available in oak, like this one, or mahogany. A note in the bedroom furniture stock book of  Heal & Son says production of the design was discontinued in 1949.\n\nAfter the Second World War, rationing in Britain persisted under the Utility scheme which controlled the design and distribution of furniture. Utility furniture often only had solid wood for the frames. The rest of the piece was constructed from veneered panels to conserve timber. The designer and furniture maker Gordon Russell led the design panel for the Utility Furniture Scheme but did not contribute designs for the range. These were supplied by a committee of designers, with most of the work done by Edwin Clinch and H. J. Cutler. They were both based in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, an area with a tradition of furniture-making.",
