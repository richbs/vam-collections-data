            "public_access_description": "This hinged box is decorated with reverse-painted panels of ox horn, each comprising a self-contained scene of auspicious motifs representing longevity and happiness, such as deer, tigers, peonies, rocks and various types of birds. They are set off against a deep red background creating an overall harmonious and luxurious decorative effect. In contrast, ox horn panels with motifs painted against a yellow or green background appear more colourful but also less delicate. The four horizontal edges are each decorated with three sets of interlocking diamond-shapes made of brass. They are auspicious symbols which were frequently used in the Choson period to adorn many different kinds of objects, ranging from metal and lacquer wares to textiles. The lid is secured by a vertically joined brass lock on a large circular plate. The top of the lock is shaped in the form of a butterfly while a five-petalled flower can be seen at the bottom. \n\nThe box dates to the late Choson dynasty (1392-1910), when painted ox-horn decoration was popular. The technique is extremely laborious as it requires the ox-horn to be soaked in warm water or steamed, whereupon it is flattened and then separated into thin, translucent layers. These are then cut into squares or rectangles and painted on the reverse. The painted panels are finally glued onto a wooden object, in this case a box, with the painted side facing the wood, so that the design shows through to the undecorated horn surface. The robust outer surface of the horn is polished to a brilliant finish. \n\nThe technique of ox-horn decoration is unique to Korea, and it was used on sewing-boxes, small chests and clothes boxes, as well as on smaller items, such as rulers and combs. The size of the V&A box and its decoration suggests that it was made for the royal court. The Museum has several lacquer wares in its collection, but this is the only piece decorated solely with ox horn. This is in itself not surprising considering Choson ox horn objects are far outnumbered by lacquer wares. One likely reason behind this is that ox horn is generally more susceptible to changes in atmospheric conditions than lacquer objects. Alterations in temperature and humidity cause the splitting and curling of the horn panels, resulting in them curling away from the wooden frame to which they are attached. Therefore they survive less well over time. Also the V&A box had to undergo extensive conservation work before being displayed in the gallery.",
