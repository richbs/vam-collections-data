Their first protest activity was to send 'Mother's Day cards' to their political representatives, including the United States President:\n'For my Mother's Day gift this year,/ I don't want candy or flowers./ I want an end to killing./ We who have given life/ must be dedicated to preserving it./Please talk peace.' The initial run of 1000 cards swelled to 200,000 due to the project's popular appeal. The profile of the organisation was further raised when Lorraine Schneider created the AMP sunflower logo with the words: \"War is not healthy for children and other living things.\" This message became very popular for a time in the United States and was reprinted on bumper stickers, cards and posters such as this one.\nIt also prompted other protesters to continue the theme with posters such as \"Peace is not healthy for generals and other killing things.\"",
