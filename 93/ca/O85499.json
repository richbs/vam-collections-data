ISBN 1851773088.\nAn interest in both materials and processes of manufacture motivated many of the Museum's early acquisitions, as with the purchases made from international exhibitions (cats.2-13). Although the degree of this concern with materials and techniques has varied, it has always been reflected in the collection of models (cats.16, 87, 136-137), textile designs (cats. 139, 186.1, 190.1), and works that illustrate printing processes (cats. 36-39). This irresistible demonstration of craftsmanship was given in 1874 by the artist James Ronca, a carver of cameos in hard stones and shell, who had for thirty years produced the cameo portraits of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert that were mounted in the Royal Victorian Order, the Queen's personal award.\nThis six-step series was made to illustrate the preparation of a shell cameo portrait from its earliest state, the shell itself, with a section for the cameo removed, to the finished portrait of John Everett Millais, the pre-Raphaelite painter. Intermediate stages demonstrate how the carver cut a rough blank and sketched on the shell a pencil outline of the portrait. Outer layers of the shell were then partially stripped away and the profile cleared right to the ground (the bottom or inside layer of the shell). In the final state, fine details such as hair are silhouetted against the dark polished ground, while portions of the upper layer are retained to give colour and relief to the head. As well as being clearly instructive, the series is a virtuoso example of nineteenth-century shell cameo carving and shows how the more experienced carvers in the medium could produce work of a quality rivalling that of the more costly and prestigious hard-stone cameos.\nAt the time of its acquisition, the series was sent to Bethnal Green where it was quickly consigned to storage. Rediscovered in 1991, it was displayed at the V&A in the Sculpture Department's Materials and Techniques galleries. In its new position next to the collection of carved gems and shell cameos the series is accompanied by a panel explaining the cameo carving process, with an illustration of a nineteenth-century shell cameo-cutter's workbench. The label also quotes a passage from an interview of 1908 with Ronca in which he describes his work and the different processes involved in cutting hard-stone and shell cameos.\n\nLit.Thompson, 1898; Evening News, 1908; Bury,1991, vol.1, p.218.\n\nLUCY CULLEN",
