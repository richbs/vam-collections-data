Their wealthy owners engaged in few commercial exchanges requiring cash.  In addition to serving as 'sweet bags' or 'gift wrapping', purses sometimes contained mirrors for grooming.  Others functioned as sewing kits which held needles, thread and tiny scissors.\n\nMaterials & Making\nCanvas work was a popular form of embroidery in the 17th century.  It used a linen canvas ground with an open weave so that stitches of silk or metal thread could be worked over each intersection of warp and weft in a regular manner.  A variety of stitches such as tent, cross, plait and Gobelin stitch, appear in canvas work.\n\nDesigns & Designing\nThe floral pattern of cornflower, carnation, pansy, borage and rose is typical of early English 17th-century embroidery.  A variety of embroidery pattern books offered similar designs to be used on nightcaps, coifs, purses and other accessories.",
