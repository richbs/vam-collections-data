On the same side is an incised parasol, an emblem of royalty, with traces of its original gold inlay. Nearby is a gold inlaid sun with curling rays and human features. The hilt is made of copper, thickly gilt and chased all over with floral decoration. The leather-covered scabbard is original and has matching gilt copper mounts. The parasol indicates a former royal owner and the overall style of the sword suggest this was somewhere within the Mughal empire in the second half of the 17th century. It was bought at a UK auction in 1987.",
