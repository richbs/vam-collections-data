In 1925 he was invited to become artistic director of the Velten-Vordamm pottery, near Berlin, where he stayed until the following year. His influence on the pottery's production was considerable and continued well after his departure.\n\nThis bowl and lid, to a design developed during Bogler's time at the Bauhaus, appears to have been made while he was director at Velten-Vordamm. It was acquired by the Museum in 1993 from Galerie Ulrich Fiedler in Cologne. It had been bought by Fiedler from gallery Fifty-50, 793 Broadway, New York, having formerly been in the possession of \"a German Jewish immigrant family\" (letter from U. Fiedler, 24 February 1993).",
