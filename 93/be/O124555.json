            "public_access_description": "This is the second drawing from a series of twelve watercolours which show the manufacturing processes of Doulton's Lambeth pottery works by William Rowe about 1893. In this drawing, three workers are unloading clay from a barge, which is a spacious, flat-bottomed vessel for transporting cargo, to the factory. Below the drawing is a pencil sketch showing clay held by hands. Above the drawing, the painter indicated, in pencil, that the process represented was that of 'unloading clay from barge'. \n\nThis drawing, along with other drawings in the series, provide a unique insight into the workings of the Lambeth factory. They not only depict processes from digging, grinding and purifying clay, to modelling, decorating, glazing and firing the finished piece, but also include portraits of Doulton's most important and influential designers and craftsmen, such as the Barlow sisters and Mark Marshall.\n\nThe set of drawings remained in the archives of the factory for many years until the dispersal of the Doulton material, when they were bought by the collectors of art pottery, Allen Harriman and Edward Judd. The designs seem not to have been executed in ceramic form as panels or a frieze as intended. However, it is recorded that a set of full-scale drawings was made and displayed at the Chicago exhibition in 1893 and were later purchased by Northwestern University Guild.",

These watercolours by William Rowe appear to include portraits of Doulton's most important and influential designers and craftsmen, such as the Barlow sisters and Mark Marshall. William Rowe himself also occasionally worked at Lambeth, and it is possible that one of these drawings might include his own portrait. The Lambeth pottery works depicted in these drawings show that factory life has shifted from 'dark satanic mill' horrors to a light and airy atmosphere. Part of Doulton's Lambeth factory still survives in Lambeth on Black Prince Road.",
