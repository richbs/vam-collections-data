More recently the Museum labelled it 'Flanders, possibly Malines, about 1480'.\nHowever, many of the medieval and renaissance objects sold by Spitzer have subsequently been identified as fake and this spoon is almost certainly one of them (see Tait, 1991, p. 351). The spoon entered the collection of George Salting, who bequeathed it to the Museum on his death in 1910.",
