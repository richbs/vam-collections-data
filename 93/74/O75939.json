It is also similar to designs by Anna Maria Garthwaite in the 1740s for silk made in Spitalfields. This area of east London was famous for silk weaving from about 1700. Wallpapers with an identical design but printed in a single colour have been found in Eagle House, Bathford (in yellow), and at Doddington Hall, Lincolnshire. A receipt dated May 1760 records that Thomas Chippendale supplied the paper to Sir William Robinson. It was hung in both the front and rear rooms on the first floor of his house in London. \n\nThe second wallpaper has a smaller pattern of trailing flowers and foliage. It probably dates from around 1770. Flocks were heavier than other papers and needed a stronger glue to fix them to the wall. Decorators often pasted the new paper on top to avoid the trouble and extra expense of removing the previous paper. On the back are two pencil sketches that transferred from the plastered wall to the lining paper. They show other schemes for the drapery of a Venetian window. The sketches are probably by Thomas Chippendale, or possibly one of his assistants. Chippendale's firm supplied and hung the red flock wallpaper.",
