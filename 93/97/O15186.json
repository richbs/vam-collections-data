The body is of a dark-brown colour and covered with a thin crackled glaze, which is very uneven and leaves unglazed areas exposed. There is some glaze degradation near the foot.The vase dates from the 15th century, coinciding with the early part of the Choson dynasty (1392-1910). It is classified as punch'ong ware. The term punch'ong is a contraction of a modern Korean term - punjang hoech'ong sagi - meaning 'green, powder-like dressing on a grey vessel'. Punch'ong wares were made during the 15th and 16th centuries. They are stonewares, often decorated with white slip. Inlaid, incised and carved designs were particularly popular, but spontaneous, free-spirited motifs painted with brown iron oxide, as well as other types of design, are also found.",
