There are 4 white and 4 yellow flaps, arranged alternately, with a flap at each end in the same colours.  On these end flaps are transers showing the rules; the other flaps are numbered 1 to 4.

Around the outside of each set of keys is a plain metal bar.  The keys are attached under the playing surface to one of the metal flap, corresponding to its number.  The metal bars operate the end flaps or goals.  Above the playing surface on all sides is fitted a metal `net' which can be released and be folded down for storage.
