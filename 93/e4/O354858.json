The shoulder-bands, of very fine texture, are woven in bright-coloured silks with figures (in chariots?), animals and birds, all rendered in an obscure angular convention.  The rest of the tapestry-work is in coloured wools and undyed linen thread.  The lower border has three large circles containing: - (1) a figure (saint?) on horseback holding a long spear (?) in one hand and a globe in the other, with a standing figure on each side; (2) two figures standing by a lake on which is a man in a boat (repeated twice); (3) a man with two large hounds in leash amid trees.  The circles are outlined by a row of heart-shaped floral forms, edged by interlaced and geometrical ornament, and are connected by small circles formed by bands of similar design.  The intervening spaces contain large floral devices of shaped triangular form.  The square panel on the right contains a semicircle with an adaptation of the subject in the last circle of the lower band, and to the right, two winged figures beneath a tree, in which are two birds.  The subject within the semicircle on the other square is undecipherable.  The ground throughout is red.  The pattern of the silk shoulder-bands appears to be later in character than that ot the other tapestry-work; possibly they may be an 8th or 9th century addition to an earlier tunic; the use of silk rather than wool is to be noticed.",
