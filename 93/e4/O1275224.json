A close survey of her life sees her transformed from muse to ground-breaking artist\n\nBorn in Poughkeepsie, New York, Miller began her modelling career on the cover of American Vogue before meeting Man Ray in Paris in 1929.  She bacame both his lover and muse and under his guidance started to produce her own imagery.  On returning to New York she set up her own studio working in fashion, advertising and celebrity portraiture.  \n\nIn the 1930s she documented her travels to Egypt and Romania whilst spending summers in Europe with her Surrealist friends.\n\nIn 1940 she became a freelance photographer for Vogue and later war correspondent.  She was the only woman in combat photojournalism in Europe during the Second World War.  The magazine published Miller's searing dispatches including reports on the Liberation of Paris, the siege of St Malo, the death camps in Dachau and Buchenwald and the banality of Hitler's apartment in Munich.  After the war Miller married Roland Penrose and returned to portraiture, concluding her career with a humourous series titled Working Guests photographing famous artists, including Picasso, on their farm in Sussex.\n\nThis limited edition selection of gelatin silver print photographs printed from Lee Miller's original negatives were selected by Mark Haworth-Booth, the curator of the 2007 V&A exhibition The Art of Lee Miller.  They have been printed and published by the Lee Miller Archives to commemorate the centenary year of Lee Miller.",
