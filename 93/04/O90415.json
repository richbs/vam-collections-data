Her early-stage sketches for the Spike Light fill three sides of a pocket-sized sketchbook. Unusually for a product designer of our time, these are the only designs she made before she developed the shape and form of the light through hands-on moulding of the material. The finished product is made out of pre-pleated aluminium mesh. The sketches show her initial ideas, with fluted forms developing from the pleats. The final shape of the lampshade came through handling the material, and seeing how it worked and could be manipulated in practice.",
