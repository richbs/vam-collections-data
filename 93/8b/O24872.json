His symbols - the sword, which cuts the knot of ignorance, and book, representing the teachings or dharma - are held in lotus flowers at each shoulder. Facing him is Maitreya, the embodiment of compassion and the Buddha of the Future epoch. He makes a similar hand gesture.

His hands are raised in the gesture of \"turning the wheel\" (dharmacakramudra).  Lotus support his attributes, the sword (\"cutting through the darkness of ignorance\"), and the book of the law (dharma).  Facing Manjusri is Maitreya (Tib: Byams-pa), the buddha of the future epoch who will restore Buddhism after a period of neglect.  Maitrya is similarly seated to Manjusri and also performs the dharmacakramudra gesture, evoking the Buddha's teachings.  Both figures are seated on Chinese thrones and are richly attired in the Chinese manner, reflecting the close links between Tibet and China in this period.",
