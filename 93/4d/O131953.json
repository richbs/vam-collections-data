This silk programme was produced in honour of the opening of the Metropolitan Opera House at the Lincoln Centre, New York, and unlike many attempts at producing modern silk programmes, this has the sumptuous feel of a much older silk programme, because of the quality of the silk.\n\nFor the inaugural performance of the Metropolitan Opera House the new opera Antony and Cleopatra was comissioned from the romantic and lyrical American composer Samuel Barber (1910-1981),  The production was designed and staged by the great Italian film and opera director and designer Franco Zeffirelli ((b.1923) and conducted by the promimenent American conductor Thomas Schippers (1930-1977).  The occasion of the opening of a grand opera house with a new opera certainly merited the production of a sumptuous silk programme which was rolled around bamboo and presented in its own gold-coloured cardboard tube.",
