It was awarded for sales of more than \u00a375000 of the album A Nice Pair, a 1974 double release of Pink Floyd's first two albums on one record or cassette (1967's The Piper at the Gates of Dawn and 1968's A Saucerful of Secrets). The BPI first started awarding metallic discs in April 1973, on a revenue based system, but this was replaced in January 1978 with a unit system. They continue to this day, with the BPI having awarded over 9000.\n\nSyd Barrett had long since left Pink Floyd by the time he received this award. Having embarked on a solo career in 1968, at his record label's request, he managed to record two albums before departing the music industry. He was persuaded into Abbey Road Studios in August 1974, but only recorded for 3 days before leaving for a hotel in London, where he stayed until 1978. He moved back to Cambridge and became an artist, disengaging from public life.",
