Apprentice goldsmiths applying for master-goldsmith status usually had to make a trial piece of work, or 'masterpiece', that met an agreed standard of workmanship. From 1531 until 1572 Nuremberg apprentices were required to make a columbine cup (named after its resemblance to the columbine flower), a gold ring set with a precious stone and a steel seal die. In some guilds apprentices or journeymen were not allowed to marry until their masterpieces had been accepted. Otherwise, they were subject to fines. If a masterpiece was refused, applicants could continue as journeymen working for other goldsmiths. They could also try to persuade a master to submit their work under his hallmark, although this defied guild regulations.",
