Reacting against the futuristic minimal fashions of the preceding years, designers began to look towards flowing forms, natural materials, hand-craft and traditional fabrics, drawing inspiration from folk dress, historicism and romanticised ideas of a gypsy lifestyle.\n\nThis hood consists of a close fitting cap with an extending piece of fabric, known as a bavolet, covering the neck. The bavolet  is attached to the cap with leather ties and has scalloped edging, decorated with perforations and embossed circles to give a hand-tooled effect. \n\nThe piece was designed by George Mallard, a London based milliner who established his business in 1954 under his own name. In 1966 the company was renamed Malyard Hats. Known for his innovative and fashionable hats, Mallard designed for both men and women and catered to the retail and wholesale trades. The company ceased trading in 1985 upon Mallard's retirement.",
