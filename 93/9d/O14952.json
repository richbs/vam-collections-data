            "bibliography": "<u>100 Great Paintings in The Victoria & Albert Museum.</u> London: V&A, 1985, p.196\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"Edward Burra 1905-1976\n<i>British School</i> \nSURREALIST COMPOSITION c.1934 \nWater-colour, 77.7 X 35.2 cm \nP.6-1960 \n\nEdward Burra was an individualist and subscribed to no school or style, apart from his brief alliance with the English Surrealists (with whom he exhibited in 1936 and 1938), and his membership of the abstract art group <i>Unit One</i>, organized by Paul Nash, in 1933.\n \nIn a sense, though typical in colour and manner, this gouache is not representative of Burra's art as a whole. Most of his work was figurative, exaggerated caricatures in the style of George Grosz, with an emphasis on low-life and the exotic. His later work included still life and landscape subjects. His adoption of Surrealist principles - creating an alternative reality by the exploration of the sub-conscious mind and dream imagery in free association - was brief: from around 1929 (when he worked almost exclusively in collage) to 1934, at the latest. In his interest in, and use of these ideas he was in advance of his contemporaries, most of whom remained unaffected until the mid 1930's when Surrealist works were first exhibited in London. Burra had toured France with Nash in 1930, and they encountered Surrealist painting and collage in the galleries there, but Burra was already familiar with the work of Max Ernst, Magritte and others from German and Belgian magazines.\n\nIn this picture it is evident that he had absorbed much of the visual vocabulary of Surrealism, though this composition has none of the menace so characteristic of his low-life underworld scenes. The female figure who dominates the whole is a pastiche of elements from Ernst and Magritte in this period. The influence of De Chirico is apparent too, in the massive arcaded building on the right, with its long vista of blank windows, and in the heavy shadows. The small figure, left of centre casts a long shadow towards the viewer and this has been anthropomorphized by the addition of eyes, and of tiny claw-like hands and feet. Certain elements such as the white pseudo-Georgian folly to the left betray the English origin of the composition. \n\nThe perspective of the whole is illogical, and therefore disturbing. It is impossible to reconcile background and foreground, left and right. There are elements of 'trompe l'oeil' too: the emblematical rectangles above and below the arcaded building appear to have been stuck on to the picture.\n \nIn spite of the borrowings the style is distinctly Burra's own. The wit and vigour of his large water-colours (he never used oil) were much admired by fellow artists, and he was considered by Paul Nash and Wyndham Lewis to be one of the finest living painters. \n\nGillian Saunders\"\nThe following is an excerpt from an article entitled 'Edward Burra: Spain and Surrealism' by Katherine Hudson, which appeared in <i>The </i><i>British Art Journal</i>, Volume XII, No. 1. \"<i>Surrealist Composition</i> exhibits many of the motifs and stylistic traits that were to characterise Burra's work of the 1930s. Its title designates Burra as a surrealist before the movement had truly emerged in England, and in retrospect, this categorisation proves a useful means of viewing his work within some sort of art historical frame. But how far was Burra really a Surrealist? Clearly, he drew on a rich heritage of English romanticism and whimsy, which the major theoriticians of surrealism in Britain, Herbert Read, David Gascoyne, and Andr\u00e9 Breton acknowledged as a significant precursor to the movement - Lewis Carroll is a recurring reference point in their writing, and the precipitous tunnels and doorways to different worlds in <i>Surrealist Composition</i>recall the fantasy realm of <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>. At the same time, the increasing exposure Burra gained to the European Surrealist exhibitions in London and Paris had, without doubt, a considerable bearing on his style. Andrew Causey cites in particular Miro's <i>Portrait of Mrs Mills</i> c. 1750 (after George Engelheart) (1929) and Picasso's fragmented female figures as influences, while spatially, de Chirico seems an obvious comparison.\"",
