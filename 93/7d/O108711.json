They would have been used during the service of Mass, when wine (in the chalice) and bread (on the paten) are consecrated by a priest and, in Catholic belief, transform miraculously into the body and blood of Christ. The costly value of the silver and the high quality of the craftsmanship reflect the precious nature of their function. The foot of the chalice is chased (hammered into relief) with the twelve apostles and the paten depicts Christ in Majesty. \n\nBy tradition, these were the only items of silver from the Convent to survive an attack during the French Revolution in 1791, a period when much French silver was melted down. The convent had been set up in 1630. These pieces were probably presented to the nuns when their chapel was ready for services and were probably the gift of 'IC' whose unidentified arms are engraved on the foot of the chalice. He may have been the priest Jacques Camusat, who first suggested the foundation of the convent.",

            "historical_context_note": "The Counter Reformation \nThe 16th century was a period of intense self examination for the Roman Catholic church. Internal dissent was undermining its authority and whole nations were going over to the new Protestant faiths. To clarify its role, the church held the Council of Trent from 1545 to 1563. It addressed concerns about religious education, abuses of wealth and the relief of the poor. The Society of Jesus (the Jesuits) became the champion of the reformed Catholic church and promoted the faith worldwide. At the heart of this Counter Reformation was the need to restore the Eucharist to the centre of worship. In Catholic belief, the Eucharist enshrines the moment when bread and wine, consecrated at the altar, are transformed into the body and blood of Christ. A priest holding up a monstrance Detail from The Adoration of the Holy Eucharist, by Claudio Coello, 1685-90 Monasterio del Escorial, Madrid.\n\nArt and Faith \nThe image and message of the reinvigorated Roman Catholic church were actively promoted through dramatic architecture and furnishings. Throughout the 17th century new churches were built in the grand Baroque style. Their sumptuous interiors were complemented by elaborate monstrances, candelabra, sanctuary lamps and censers. Awe-inspiring altar silver drew the eyes of the faithful towards the Eucharist.",
