            "history_note": "Historical significance: From the mid-sixteenth century commissioning series of painted portraits of notable ancestors became a common habit among upper classes. In some cases people would commission series of sculpted portraits, far fewer examples of which survive. This bust belongs to a series of eight portraits of illustrious members of the Calderini family, six of which survive in different museums and private collections. \nThe sitter, Giovanni Andrea Calderini, was a celebrated Doctor of Laws, and a member of the Collegio Civile and Collegio Canonico of the University of Bologna, a Canon of Bologna Cathedral, Vicar-General of Bologna and Auditor of the Rota (judge of the papal court). He is first recorded in 1410 lecturing on canon law. The significance of the date 1424 inscribed on the base is unknown. \nPope-Hennessy attributed this bust to Andrea Marchesi, called Formigine, on the basis of a comparison with the monument to Giovan Battista Malavolta in San Giacomo Maggiore, Bologna. The bust at Hartford was ascribed by Ulrich Middeldorf to the Bolognese sculptor Girolamo Cortellini, and later, more convincingly, to Lazzaro Casario (1542-1592). This attribution is confirmed by stylistic comparison with the bust of Elisabetta Bianchini Vizzani in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (inv. 69.48), the only signed work by Casario, dated 1589. The busts belonging to the Calderini series share a similar composition and a kind of geometrical abstraction in the carving of the costumes, which does not reveal the bodies underneath. Furthermore, some busts have identical base and costume.",

            "historical_context_note": "This portrait is part of a series of eight busts mentioned by Marcello Oretti in Palazzo Calderini in Bologna in the 18th century: 'otto busti di sette uomini illustri di tale casato con una donna illustre, marmo bianco come il naturale' (Marcello Oretti e il patrimonio artistico privato bolognese, eds. E.Calbi and D. Scaglietti Kelescian, Bologna 1984, p. 216). The series is now dispersed: three busts are in private collections, one in the Museo Davia Bargellini, Bologna (inv. 315), and one in the Wadsworth Athenaeum, Hartford (inv. 1959.230). The location of the remaining two busts is unknown, although at the beginning of the last century they were recorded in the Bardini collection in Florence.",
