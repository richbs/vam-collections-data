Ethel Augusta Dumayne was the eldest of at least five children, the others being Clarice (born ca. 1883), Henry (born ca 1886), Dorothy (born ca 1888) and Norah (born ca 1890).  Their parents were Henry Langford Dumayne, a dentist, and his wife (n\u00e9e Eliza Cranswick Cooper).\nThe two different types of mark on the set establish the date of manufacture so firmly that either Ethel Augusta was christened at seven years of age, which is quite possible, or the set was given to her at a later date, perhaps by a godparent.",
