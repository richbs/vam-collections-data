The volume of the chair has been pared down without reducing its comfort, and new foam-rubber padding has been used in place of bulky springs. The upholstery looks as if it has been draped over the metal frame.\n\nThe Flamingo armchair undeniably shows the influence of international design trends on mid-twentieth-century British furniture design. Specifically, it recalls the form of the Womb Chair, designed by Eero Saarinen in 1948 and made by the American manufacturer Knoll.  Ernest Race was a leading British designer of the post-War years, who introduced new materials and techniques to British furniture. The Flamingo armchair was selected as a 'design of the year' by the Council of Industrial Design in 1959.",
