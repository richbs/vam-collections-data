By the 19th century these chains had fallen out of fashion.  Only priests, and people who wore traditional dress, continued to use them.  It is impossible to date these chains accurately, as they remained unchanged for centuries, and are rarely marked.  \n\nMost were made of plain silver, but silversmiths in the town of Veliky Ustyug, in the north of European Russia, made fine enamelled chains in the 17th century.  These were extensively copied in the 19th century, with the revival of Russian nationalism.\n\nSome chains were purely decorative, but most carried religious pendants. This chain has an octagonal pendant, which would originally have contained an icon or cross.  It hangs from an ogival bead with the image of Christ's head on the front.",
