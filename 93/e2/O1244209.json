The date commemorates the Stonewall riots of June 28th, 1969 a day which is recognised as the start of the gay rights movement in the U.S. and around the world. \n\nThe Stonewall Inn was a gay bar in Greenwich Village, New York City. Despite weekly police payoffs, police raids were frequent. Starting in the early morning of 28th June, and continuing for three days clientele fought back against the Police who had raided the Inn. The Riots are now generally credited with being the first instance in the U.S. that gays and lesbians fought back against a government-sponsored system that persecuted sexual minorities. \n\nUnite to Fight! was originally printed at Times Change Press, in New York in about 1973. Times Change Press was founded in 1970 by Su Negrin and Tom Wodetzki, and provided opportunities for artists representing various positions on the political spectrum, including anarchist, Marxist-Leninist, communitarian, socialist, feminist, lesbian and gay. Inkworks, a democratically run worker collective and a union shop, reprinted it in 1976.",
