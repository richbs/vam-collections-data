The Museum Number is in the top left hand corner.\nNOTE: this panel seems to have all the design elements of the main number, but on a larger scale.\n\nThere is a border along the bottom: chevron stem and pink blossom facing the lower right with a spray of 3 mauve flowers facing to the upper right.  Edged with light green chevron lines which continue part of the way up both sides.\nThe main pattern is a series of diagonal lines from lower right to upper left.  These are chevron lines in light green and dark blue.\n\nThere are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: pink blossom with a white base pointing either to the lower left or upper right alternating with an angled chevron stem and white pointed flower pointing either straight down or to the right.\n[2] wider stripes in two designs: [a] noticeable diamonds: yellow vase outlined in light blue with pink and light blue flowers alternating with yellow cone-forms outlined in light blue with pink and blue flowers and 2 flowers outlined in black.\n[b] seems to be designed in four sections: angled chevron stem with pointed flower outlined in light blue pointing down edged along the top with 5 faded mauve flowers; a pair of black edged pink flowers and a group of 7 small mauve flowers around a pink centre; angled chevron stem with right pointing blue flower; yellow vase pointing right outlined in light blue with 2 black edged flowers and a mass of pink and mauve flowers.\n\nThreads: silk; 2S; dark blue, dark green, green, white, light blue, orange, yellow, black, red, mauve and pink.",
