The second border, far more ornate, is composed of six classical portrait busts of Greek philosophers within laurel wreaths all encompassed by a framework of strapwork, scrolling foliage, and female masks on matted and trelliswork ground. The central medallion is decorated with an applied escutcheon surmounted by a marquess's coronet within an elaborate pierced and chased surround of putti, strapwork, and swags on an engraved trelliswork ground. The centre boss was later engraved with the Grenville coat of arms. The boarder between the central medallion and the broad rim was added later and is composed of a flat-chased band of scrolls, shells, and scalework. The names of each philosopher is engraved on the reverse: HERACLITUS, DEMOCRITUS, DIOGENES, ANTISTHENES, ZALEUCUS and SOCRATES.",

It was probably made for Richard Temple, Viscount Cobham of Stowe in Buckinghamshire. The Rococo decoration around the centre was added about 1740, and the coat of arms for Richard Grenville, 2nd Marquess of Buckingham, after 1812, from which period the gilding most probably dates. \n\nWhen the Catholic King Louis XIV revoked the religiously tolerant Edict of Nantes in 1685, Huguenots (French Protestants) were forced to leave the country. Many were craftsmen who settled in London.  Their technical skills and fashionable French style ensured the luxury silver, furniture, watches and jewellery they made were highly sought after.  Huguenot specialists transformed English silver by introducing higher standards of craftsmanship. They promoted new forms, such as the soup tureen and sauceboat, and introduced a new repertoire of ornament, with cast sculptural details and exquisite engraving.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver,  mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",

It would appear to have been modified on at least two occasions subsequent to its original manufacture. The engraved rococo scale and scrollwork around the central cartouche was probably done between ten and fifteen years later; this decoration bears a close resemblance to that on a series of trays by de Lamerie dating from the mid 1730s to early 1740s (see for example, Clayton, 1985B, P. 170, no. 3 and Phillips, 1935, pl. LXXXVII). The gilding is certainly not original and probably dates from the time at which the coat of arms and marquess's coronet were added, that is, in or after 1813. (Schroder, 1988, p.194)  The arms...are those of Grenville, for Richard, second marquess of Buckingham (1776-1839). In 1796 he married Lady Anna Eliza, daughter and sole heir of James Brydges, duke of Chandos, in consequence of which he assumed in 1799 the additional surnames of Brydges-Chandos. He succeeded his father in 1813 and was created Earl Temple of Stowe, marquess of Chandos, and duke of Buckingham in 1822.
