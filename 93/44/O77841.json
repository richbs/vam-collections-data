This example is thus datable to around 1810-1820.\n\nMaterials & Making\nExperiments in re-creating the metallic lustre on pottery, which was already known from 15th- and 16th-century Spanish and Italian maiolica (tin-glazed earthenware), took place in Germany and France at the end of the 18th century. It was in England, however, that the process was perfected and used commercially, probably first in 1805 by John Hancock working for Daniel & Brown, the decorators who occupied part of the Spode factory at Stoke-on-Trent. This silver lustre, at first intended as an embellishment for porcelain, was made by dissolving platinum in acid and combining it with spirits of tar. After the biscuit-fired pot was painted with this mixture, it was reduction-fired at low temperature in order to convert the oxide back to a very thin film of untarnishable metal. Until the invention of cheap electro-plating in 1840, vast quantities of this silver-lustred pottery were made, particularly in Staffordshire and Yorkshire, which were exported to France via Jersey, and to Scandinavia and other parts of the Continent via the port of Hull.",
