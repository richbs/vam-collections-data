Its lower edge dips down in a broad arc. The central window to allow the keys to strike the platen is a continuously curved lozenge. The carriage, when moved into its central position, fits precisely into the side profiles of the stationary back bar. The chromed levers and handles grouped at either end of the carriage are subordinated to the strong sculptural character of the body. The back of the carriage is relieved by a series of closely aligned, parallel channels.",
