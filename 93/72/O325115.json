It was originally worn with the curved section over the top of the head, like an Alice band, and was used to hold an expensive lace cap safely in place against the force of a north-sea gale.  It was usually covered by another cap when in use, so that the only parts which could be seen were the two decorative gold ends peeping out by the ears.  \n\nIt was described as 'worn by Vierlander women in the neighbourhood of Hamburg' when it was acquired in 1872.  Although these head ornaments are now considered uniquely Dutch, they were worn over a wider area before the 19th century.  Many elements of the traditional jewellery of the North Sea coast region of Germany are shared with Dutch jewellery. \n\nIt was bought for five shillings at the International Exhibition, London, 1872.",
