In 1982, Bowie asked him to design the set for the 1983 Serious Moonlight Tour.  Boshier also worked on the cover of Bowie Let\u2019s Dance Album (1983) \u2013 a huge  global commercial success which generated more income than all his previous albums put together.  Bowie intended to go back to more theatrical presentations following the 1976 Thin White Duke Tour which was based around using Brechtian lighting.  Bowie asked Boshier to come up \u201cwith something punky\u201d. This is reflected in the fragmented design.  In the event, the design proved too complicated for the likely venues and it was replaced with a simpler design largely using lighting.",
