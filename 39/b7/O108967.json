            "history_note": "<i>Collected Stories</i> was a new play by Donald Margulies, directed by Howard Davies, designed by John Gunter with lighting by Peter Mumford and sound by John A Leonard. It was advertised as 'a provocative play' in which 'respected short-story writer Ruth Steiner becomes the mentor to budding fiction writer Lisa Morrison. Ruth eventually welcomes the awe-struck student, revealing secrets of the craft and intimate details of her painful past including a shattering affair with the poet Delmore Schwartz. But Lisa's emergence as a successful novelist, cannibalising Ruth's own experiences for her subject matter, takes an appalling toll on the artist, as Lisa evolves from protege to friend to peer and ultimately to threatening rival. \n\nThe production starred the film, stage and television actress Helen Mirren as Ruth 'who was last seen on the London stage in the Royal National Theatre's production of Antony and Cleopatra, she is perhaps best known for her starring role in television's Prime Suspect for which she has received no less than four BAFTA Awards for Best Actress.' Anne-Marie Duff played Lisa.",
