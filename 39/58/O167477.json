Carruthers withdrew the loan and offered the cabinet in exchange (in the end he gave the cabinet and one chair)\n\nCarruthers described the cabinet as \"a glazed William & Mary china cupboard\" and enclosed a rough pencil sketch (in the RP).  Carruthers who appeared to Thorpe (V & A) to be \"well-informed about English furniture\" stated that the china cupboard was English, not Dutch, and \"extremely pretty in design\".\n\nThorpe & Edwards agreed to the exchange and \"take (Carruthers) word for the cabinet \" as they have no way to inspect it.\n\nCarruthers further description\nrefers to it as this \"Carolean china cabinet\u2026unique so far as I know\".  He sends a print taken shortly before delivery (not in RP) and notes \"there is a good deal of worm\" and\n\"Being originally a painted piece some of the bits (chiefly in the drawer front) are laid open lengthwise but I am confident you will have no difficulty in accepting it as genuine throughout, and English.  The mixture of woods is what one would expect\u2026and I should say the handles were originally small wooden knobs as there is no sign of the 'Tuck in' holes that\u2026brasses would leave\u2026\u2026Judging by the colour alteration behind the later brass plates the stripping could have been quite a time ago.  The drawer seems to have been much in use at one time.\nWhat a pity it didn't turn up in time for the great Dictionary\".\n\nCarruther letter, arranging delivery\n\"to me it is 1) the drawer in the stand (presumably for dusters?) and 2) the solid ends, which point to this being a true china cabinet rather than a showcase for ship models and the like\".\n\n20/6/46 Transit Room notes Condition\n\"worm eaten\nparts missing\nhandles of drawer missing\nglass panel of door missing\"\n\nLetter Ralph Edwards to Carruthers\nthanks and accepts the cabinet \"which should make an interesting students piece after repair\"\n\n1951 Letter Carruthers to Museum\nsuggests  that the museum might want to sell the cabinet as he feels they were less than thrilled with it at the time the gift was made.  Edwards declines the option to sell.",
