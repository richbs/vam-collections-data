On either side of the main approach to the Villa Cordellina at Montecchio Maggiore, near Vincenza, is a group of sculpture similar to this and the six drawings which follow. The group on the left 'Jupiter and Juno', has no immediate parallel among our designs, but the one on the right 'Rinaldo and Armida', is very close to this one (see Fig. V). It seems likely, therefore, that those studies were devised for the guidance of the sculptor who carved the garden ornaments, which are thought to be products of the workshop of the Marinalli family of Vincenza. There are some other similar studies of single standing figures; one inscribed 'Iuinone', was in the d'Hendecourt Collection.",

            "history_note": "Historical significance: Giambattista was one of the most renowned painters of eighteenth-century Italy. He studied in the workshop of Gregorio Lazzarini. However Tiepolo moved away from the classicising style of his master, creating instead works with a focus on tonal qualities in the manner employed by his contemporaries Giambattista Piazzetta and Giovanni Battista Pittoni. This follows in the tradition of the sixteenth-century artist Tiepolo. Tiepolo began his career painting a series of canvases depicting <i>Prophets</i> and <i>Apostles</i> for S Maria dei Derelitti, Venice, in 1715-16. He is documented on the register of the Venetian confraternity of painters in the following year. \n\nBy the 1720's Tiepolo's success at home brought many commissions from outside Venice. Between 1725-6 he worked in Udine, on a scheme of frescoes for the Patriarchal Palace (now the Archbishop's Palace) for the Patricarch Dionsio Dolfin. In 1730-31 Tiepolo worked in Milan producing works including frescoes for five ceilings in the Palazzo Archinto. During the 1740s, Tiepolo was at the height of his fame. He produced paintings indcluding  the <i> Family of Darius before Alexander</i> (1743) and the frescoes of <i>The meeting of Anthony and Cleopatra</i> and <i>The Banquet of Anthony and Cleopatra</i> for the Palazzo Labia, Venice. From 1750-3 Tiepolo worked in W\u00fcrzburg on a commission for frescoes of the ceiling and walls for the Kaisersaal of the Residenz at W\u00fcrzburg. Again in Venice, Tiepolo became the president of the Venetian Academy in 1756. In March, 1762, Tiepolo was summoned by Charles III of Spain (reigned 1759-88) to paint three ceiling frescoes in the Palacio Real, Madrid. He travelled that year with his sons, Giandomenico and Lorenzo, to work on the project. He was to remain in Spain until his death in 1770. Tiepolo's works ranged from frescoes and paintings on canvas of histories, mythologies and religious subjects. As well as these works, which were the result of commissions from patrons, Tiepolo also produced a series of etchings. Tiepolo was an expert printmaker. His output can be seen in the two main groups of etchings that he produced, the <i>Capricci</i>, a group of ten prints, and the 24 <i>Scherzi di fantasia</i>. Stylistically these works probably date to the 1730s or 1740s.\n\nThis is one of a group of seven drawings made by Tiepolo of pairs of lovers from Antique mythology. Each of these drawings present he figures in a pyramidal composition. Here Rinaldo is seated on the ground as he looks up at his lover, Armida. The story of Rinaldo and Armida was written by the sixteenth century poet Torquato Tasso. Set during the first Christian Crusade, it tells of how the enchantress Armida is sent to stop the crusaders from completing their mission by murdering the sleeping soldier, Rinaldo. Instead she falls in love with him and creates an enchanted garden in which to hold the soldier who, under her spell, falls in love with her. The story ends when two of Rinaldo's comrades find him and hold a shield up so that he can see his reflection, thus reminding him of his role as a crusader. In this drawing Tiepolo places the lovers close together as they gaze into each other's eyes to convey the love for each other with which they are both captivated.\n\nThis group of drawings relates to statuary on either side of the main approach to the Villa Cordellina at Montecchio Maggiore, near Vicenza. This drawing is very close in design to the sculptural group of Rinaldo and Armida on the right of the approach to the villa. It is likely that this and the other six designs were produced as a guide for the sculptor of these garden ornaments. It has been suggested that the sculptures were made at the workshop of the local Marinalli family in Vincenza. Tiepolo produced frescoes for the ceilings and walls at the Villa Cordellina in 1743 and it is probable that these designs for sculpture are of the same date.",
