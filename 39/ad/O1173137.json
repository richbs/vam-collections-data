Both could be reproduced quickly and in large numbers, whereas before this revolutionary technology they could only be drawn, painted or written by hand.\n\nThe use of woodblocks to print text had been known in the East since the 8th century. In Europe the technique was first applied to textiles, but shortly after 1400 it was adopted also for images.\n\nSoon, texts too were reproduced by various methods of printing. The final breakthrough came in the 1450s, when Johannes Gutenberg in Mainz produced a Bible using a new method based on moveable type, with individual metal letters and characters.\n\nThe artist Anne Desmet was commissioned by the Victoria and Albert Museum to produce a facsimile woodblock, copied from a French sixteenth century sheet of uncut playing cards in the collection by Gilles Savoure and make prints from the block. The whole process was filmed and can be seen in the Victoria and Albert Museum's Medieval and Renaissance Galleries.",

            "history_note": "In 2006 the printmaker Anne Desmet was commissioned by the V&A's Medieval and Renaissance Gallery team to produce a facsimile woodblock copied from a French sixteenth century sheet of uncut playing cards by Gilles Savour\u00e9 (E.988-1920) held in the Victoria and Albert Museum, and make prints from the block. The whole process was filmed for a 'How Was it Made' video which can now be seen in the V&A Medieval and Renaissance Galleries.",
