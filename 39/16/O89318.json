            "public_access_description": "This ivory statuette and its related one (V&A no. A.78-1952) are made (signed J.D.) by Jacob Dobbermann in Germany in ca. 1730-40. The present example represents Henry IV of France. It was previously thought to be made by Fran\u00e7ois Dusart (1620-1688). The accompanying statuette represents Louis II, Duke of Bourbon, Le Grand Cond\u00e9.\nJacob Dobbermann (1682-1745) was a Polish amber,- and ivory-carver, active in  Germany. He almost certainly came from a family of amber-carver in Danzig. From 1716  onwards he was the court artist of the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel. He is formally  documented as 'Bernstein- und helffenbeinarbeiter' at Kassel in 1737. He produced ivory  portrait medallions, and numerous reliefs in ivory, often depicting mythological scenes,  many of them based on South Netherlandish engraved sources.",
