His images show an enchantment with women : everyday muses - ordinary women shopping, sunbathing, sitting on benches or simply strolling around. The damage, rough hand-decorated borders and general patina of age of the prints adds to their allure. They make a wonderful example and contrast - of how it is not always the pristine, fine print by the acknowledged master that can hold a place on the gallery wall and in the Museum.",
