The upper surface was engraved with a complex design, which was \"inlaid\" with gold and silver, most of which has been lost. The term \"inlay\" is conventionally used by art historians in the context of Islamic metalwork to describe a type of decoration that, in this case at least, probably involved the following procedure:\n\n1. The surface of the brass was engraved with the design;\n2. a black organic substance was used as infill in the areas where the gold or silver accents were to be placed; and\n3. pieces of gold or silver foil, cut to shape, were stuck on to these filled areas, and the edges of the foil were then pushed down into lines already engraved in the brass.\n\nThe foil was held in place both by the black infill and by the way its edges were inserted into the engraved lines.\n\nIn its original condition, the overall effect of the decoration must have been magnificent, as almost the whole surface would have been covered with precious metal foil. It also seems that the details of the design were heightened by pushing the black organic infill into parts of the engraved design not overlaid with foil. To uninformed observers of such work, it would have appeared that the tray was inlaid with gold and silver rather than overlaid with foil over a black filler, and this is how the conventional description of \"inlay\" came about. \n",

            "public_access_description": "This tray is an outstanding example of Islamic art as it developed under the Mamluk dynasty in Egypt and Syria. Well-established techniques of metalwork were employed, such as inlaying silver into brass. But now these were used to create objects created with a new focus on spectacular inscriptions. These usually include the patron\u2019s name and titles, along with laudatory phrases. The artists interspersed the inscriptions with abstract ornamentation, such as the roundels and central geometric pattern seen here. \nThe calligraphy of the tray is majestic. The inscription reads, \u2018Glory to our lord the Sultan, the wise, the just, may his victory be glorious\u2019.",
