This gives the illusion of a single  three-dimensional image when viewed through a stereoscope designed to hold it.\n\nOwnership & Use\nStereographs were mass produced. Viewing them was a popular amusement carried out in the home from the 1850s until the early 20th century. On the reverse of this stereograph is a quote from a poem by William Cowper:\n\n'Tis pleasant through the loopholes of retreat,\nTo peep at such a world, to see the stir\nOf the great Babel, and not feel the crowd'.\n\nThe lines refer to the pleasure of viewing this bustling city scene in comfort through a stereoscope (the 'loopholes of retreat') without physically having to jostle with the crowd.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThis stereograph is from a series entitled 'Instantaneous Views of London'. The word 'instantaneous' reveals that an important selling-point for such photographs was that they quickly captured a moment in time. In this case the crowd and carriages of a busy London street are frozen in motion.",
