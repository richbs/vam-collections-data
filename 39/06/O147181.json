She is holding a drinking glass in her left hand and a long-necked flask in her right hand.  Her tunic is red and is decorated with white botehs with spangles.  Under this there is a pale pink transparent blouse with hanging sleeves.  This is embroidered over a layer of gauze.  The skirt was applique using woollen fabric woven with a shawl design over a turquoise ground. Her shoes are black with red felt indicating henna on the soles of her feet.  A wide variety of spangles have been used in quantity, decorating the headdress and accessories and indicating jewellery.  There are also embroidered white dots possibly denoting pearls.
