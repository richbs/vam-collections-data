            "public_access_description": "This necklace, with six oval micromosaic plaques depicting Bacchant boys, is an excellent example of smalti filati miniatures for jewellery produced in Rome in the early 19th century. In this piece, they are mounted alternating with gold and pearl leaves to form a necklace with two gilt-brass chains. The style of the necklace, with its elegant pearl elements, indicates a date at the beginning of the 19th century.\n\nThe choice of subject matter is as charming as it is frivolous. The cult of Bacchus appears acceptably on jewellery only in the guise of the seemingly innocent plays of the small boys. The thyrsus staff - an attribute of Bacchus, the god of wine, and a symbol of fertility - can be found on the plaques next to the Bacchant boys playing with goats as a symbol of lust. Wine appears on the remaining plaques, and might be instrumental in bringing the subjects of the other two together.\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte dominated Europe at the time when this necklace was made. His fascination for micromosaics was well-known and, as a consequence, micromosaic jewellery was quite popular, especially during the first decade of the 19th century. For example, Princess Augusta of Bavaria (1788-1851), the wife of the Viceroy of Italy, Eug\u00e8ne Beauharnais, is depicted in her portrait with a gold tiara adorned with the micromosaic of the head of Bacchus. This shows that micromosaics were an acceptable and fashionable alternative to gems and diamonds.\n\nThe micromosaics are limited to a comparatively small range of colours with tesserae of 0.2 to 0.5 millimetres in width. Cube tesserae have been used, especially in areas depicting sky. The backing of the plaques is hidden by the mounts of the necklace. The interstices are surprisingly small and partly coloured to match the surrounding glass tesserae.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes. Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",

The first micromosaics were created in the 18th century, but it was not until Arthur Gilbert himself became interested in collecting them and invented the term 'micromosaics' that they became known as such. The tesserae are minute pieces cut from thin pieces of glass known as smalti filati, and some of the finest micomosaics can consist of as many as 5,000 tesserae per square inch (ca. 3 by 3cm). By the late 18th century Rome had become central to the production of micromosaics and sold them as souvenirs to wealthy foreigners visiting the city. From small elegant snuffboxes to large monumental tabletops, micromosaics could be used to decorate objects of all shapes and sizes. They could even be made to resemble full-sized canvas paintings, and indeed Arthur Gilbert himself mistook his very first micromosaic for a painting. When he brought it home to show his wife, he had to convince her that it was not in fact a cracked painting, as she supposed, but a mosaic.",
