It is inscribed on the front MRS RICHARD PERROTT, and on the back P. MACDOWALL, R.A., SCULP. 1870. \n\nThis portrait bust was commissioned by Richard Perrot from the sculptor Patrick MacDowell together with its pendant, the bust of Richard Perrot. They are possibly amongst the last commissions undertaken by MacDowell, who died in the same year they were executed. It is not known whether they were produced for a special purpose; the donor described his father and mother as 'private persons'. Nothing further is known of the sitters.\n\nPatrick MacDowell (1799-1870) was an Irish, Belfast born, sculptor, who was initially apprenticed to a London coachbuilder. Later he trained under the sculptor Peter Francis Chenu. He attended the Royal Academy Schools, but already after two years he had a well merited and established reputation as a sculptor. His most important work is probably the memorial to Frederick Richard Chichester, Earl of Belfast (d. 1853) in Belfast Castle, but he is best known for his group depicting Europe for the Albert Memorial in Kensington Gardens.",
