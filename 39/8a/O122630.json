At the age of seventeen he became a pupil of the painter Philip Reinagle (1749-1833) and in 1788 he entered the Royal Academy Schools.  In 1790 he won a gold medal for his historical painting Caractacus Recognising the Dead Body of his Son.  \n\nIn 1791, Howard went abroad.  He spent most of his time in Italy but visited France and Switzerland on his way there and Vienna and Dresden on his way back. When in Rome he met John Flaxman, whose Neo-classical figural style helped to form his own.  When he returned to London in 1794 he continued to work in this style to produce historical works relating to subjects such as the Bible, Shakespeare and Milton.\n\nFrom 1794 he became a regular exhibitor at the Royal Academy and was elected an Associate in 1801 and a full Academician in 1808. He also exhibited work at the British Institution between 1806 and 1844.  This particular painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1808.",
