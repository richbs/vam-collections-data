A.5 and 6-1964, originally formed part of a large hooded fireplace in black marble, inset with two bronze plaques and the three marble reliefs. Frampton produced the fireplace for the Imperial Institute (later the Commonwealth Institute), London, which gave the reliefs to the Museum in 1964. There is no further record of the bronze plaques: they were presumably removed at the same time as the relief panels but did not form part of the Institute's gift to the Museum.\n\nIn an interview given to the journal Studio in 1896, Frampton commented: 'I have certainly done a good deal of interior work, both in churches and public buildings ... I have also done some fireplaces and other work at the Imperial Institute.'\n\nSir George James Frampton (1860-1928) was an English sculptor, medallist and decorative artist. He worked in an architects office before being apprenticed to a firm of architectural masons. He studied modelling a the London School of Art under W.S. Frith, attended the Royal Academy Schools. Like Lanteri he was involved in the exterior decoration of the Museum, executing the spandrel reliefs of Truth and Beauty above the Main Entrance.",
