Minton was a painter, but recognised as an illustrator and printmaker too. His preferred medium was lithography, which he felt was closer to painting than any other graphic medium. This intimate view of a guardsman's private life indirectly reflects Minton's homosexuality. Guardsmen were popular figures of attraction for upper- and middle-class gay men in the 1950s, and they gained a reputation for availability. As with many of Minton's portraits, this print draws on his fascination with the 'manly ideal'.",
