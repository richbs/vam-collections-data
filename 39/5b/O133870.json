He first trained with Christian Gottlieb Steinlen (1779-1847) in Vevey and subsequently with Fran\u00e7ois Bonnet (1811-1894) in Lausanne. In Paris in 1845, Bocion entered the atelier of Louis-Aim\u00e9 Grosclaude (1784-1869) and later that of Charles Gleyre (1806-1874) and befriended Gustave Courbet (1819-1877) and other important exponents of the Realist movement. Back in Lausanne in 1849 he became a teacher at the Ecole moyenne et industrielle of Lausanne, a position he held until his death. At the same time, he had an extensive output with several travels abroad. He exhibited in Paris, Vienna, Anvers, London and was a founder member of the Swiss society of watercolorists (1884).\n\nThis painting portrayed the Rev. Townshend's dog, a King Charles spaniel called Bully. The dog is mentioned and described in the correspondence of Charles Dickens who knew Townshend since the 1840s. This painting was executed shortly after Bocion's return in Lausanne where he probably met the Rev. Townshend. Bocion did a few animal paintings in the 1850s but the main thematic of his oeuvre is the depiction of scenes by the Leman Lake.",

Grosclaude in Paris. From 1849 he lived in Lausanne. He painted historical subjects in his early years, but subsequently concentrated almost exclusively on landscapes, in particular views of Lake Geneva. \nThere are sixteen paintings by Bocion in the bequest of the Rev. C. H. Townshend, who was in the habit of spending the winter in Lausanne. \n\n23 \nTHE REV. TOWNSHEND'S DOG \nSigned and dated lower right <i>F. Bocion 1855</i> \nCanvas \n23 \u00bd x 19 \u00bc (60 x 44) \nTownshend Bequest \n1621-1869 \n \nThis dog - a King Charles spaniel by the name of Bully - makes several appearances in the correspondence of Charles Dickens, who knew Townshend from 1840. In a letter of 1856 to Wilkie CoIlins, Dickens, in Paris, described a visit from Townshend: 'This Bully disconcerted me a great deal' (K. Robinson, <i>Wilkie Collins,</i> 1951, p. 99). On 1 February 1859 he wrote in a letter to Cerjat: 'To pass ... to Townshend ... let me report him severely treated by Bully who rules him with a paw of iron' (<i>The letters of Charles Dickens,</i> ed. G. Hogarth & M. Dickens, 1893, p. 476). Indeed, Dickens never became reconciled to Bully: on 3 May 1860, in another letter to Cerjat, he described the dog as 'old upon his legs and of a most diabolical turn of mind' (<i>ibid.,</i> p. 497). \n\nProv.

By F. Bocion. Signed. Swiss. Present century'; bequeathed by Rev. Chauncey Hare Townshend, 1868.\n\nHistorical significance: This painting is one of a group of 16 paintings bequeathed to the museum by the Rev. Townshend who had a villa in Lausanne where he spent his winters. \nThis painting portrays the Rev. Townshend's dog, a King Charles spaniel called Bully. The dog is mentioned and described in the correspondence of Charles Dickens who knew Townshend since the 1840s. This painting was executed shortly after Bocion's return in Lausanne where he probably met the Rev. Townshend. \nAlthough the thematic of the Lake Leman is central in his oeuvre, Bocion also executed a few animal paintings such as <i>Poultry</i>, dated 1855, Victoria & Albert Museum, London (1584-1869), <i>Madame Ney's Cat</i>, dated 1854, Private collection and <i>A heron</i>, dated 1855, Private collection. These paintings correspond to a period of experimentation for the painter before he concentrates on landscapes set in the surrounding of the Lake Leman in Switzerland. No such animal paintings are recorded after the 1850s.\nThis painting was bought and perhaps even commissioned by the Rev. Townshend however it does not appear in his post-mortem inventory. The V&A owns the most comprehensive group of Bocion's works in the U.K.",
