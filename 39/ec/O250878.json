The Villa Farnese on the Palatine had been acquired by the Farnese by 1565. The gateway to the grounds is in two parts: the lower part, shown here, being designed by Jacopo Barozzi Vignola. It carries a rusticated Doric order flanked by two niches. The metopes bear the Farnese fleur-de-lis. The upper part, being in a different style, has been ignored by Chambers. \n\nChambers moved to London in 1755 and published his influential Treatise on Civil Architecture in 1759.  Chambers demonstrated the breadth of his style in buildings such as Gower (later Carrington) House and Melbourne House, London, in such country houses as Duddingston, Scotland, and in the garden architecture he designed for Wilton House, Wiltshire, and at Kew Gardens. He became head of government building in 1782, and in this capacity built Somerset House, London.",
