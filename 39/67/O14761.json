His left arm is clasped round Samson's left thigh, and his head is held back by Samson's left arm. He gazes up into Samson's face. Samson looks down over his shoulder at the Philistine, and raises his right arm to strike him with the jaw-bone of an ass. A loose cloak or piece of drapery is attached to a strap worn over Samson's left shoulder, and falls over his right hip. On the front of the strap is an incised inscription.",

This is the earliest of the great marble groups by Giovanni Bologna (called Giambologna), and the only substantial work by the artist to have left Italy. Commissioned by Francesco de\u2019Medici, it was subsequently set up on a fountain in Florence. In 1601 the fountain was sent to Spain as a gift to the Duke of Lerma, chief minister of Philip III of Spain, from the Grand-Duke Ferdinando I of Tuscany. The group was later presented to Charles Prince of Wales on his visit to Spain in 1623. On its arrival in England, it was given to the king\u2019s favourite, the Duke of Buckingham, and subsequently changed hands three times before coming to the Museum in 1954.\n\nThis sculpture is a good example of the multiple viewpoints seen in Giambologna\u2019s work; the spiralling movement of the bodies means that there is no single viewpoint. This contrasts with the work of the slightly later sculpture of Bernini, whose monumental works almost invariably have only one viewpoint. Despite the fact that the marble is weathered from three centuries outdoors, Giambologna\u2019s sensitive carving is still apparent.",

            "history_note": "Giambologna , a Flemish sculptor, active in Italy. Born and trained in Flanders, he travelled to Italy in 1550 to study the masterpieces of Classical and Renaissance sculpture. On his way home, he visited Florence (c. 1552) and was persuaded to settle there under the patronage of the Medici dukes, eventually becoming their court sculptor.\n\nAs a sculptor, Giambologna grafted an understanding of the formal aspect of Michelangelo\u2019s statuary on to a thorough reappraisal of Greco-Roman sculpture, as it was being daily revealed in new excavations. Particularly influential were the ambitious representations of figures and groups in violent movement, and the technical finesse of late Hellenistic work, most of which had not been available to earlier generations (e.g. the Farnese Bull; Naples, Mus. Archeol. N.; excavated in 1546).\n\nFor half a century Giambologna dominated Florentine sculpture, carving an ever more impressive series of statue groups in marble: Samson Slaying a Philistine (1560\u201362), Florence Triumphant over Pisa (1563\u201375), the Rape of a Sabine (1582), Hercules Slaying a Centaur (1595\u20131600). In addition, Giambologna produced several extraordinary bronze statues, Bacchus (before 1562), Mercury (c. 1565) and Neptune (1566), culminating in his equestrian monument to Cosimo I, Grand Duke of Tuscany (1587\u201393). The last was copied shortly afterwards for the kings of France and Spain.\n\nBy c. 1570 Giambologna had become the most influential sculptor in Europe; apart from the fame that his monumental statues in Florence inevitably brought, his style was disseminated in the form of small bronze reproductions of his masterworks, or statuettes, which he composed independently as elegant ornaments for the interior. These were used by the Medici as diplomatic gifts for friendly heads of state, and were also eagerly purchased by European collectors as examples of sophisticated Florentine design. They were especially favoured in Germany and the Low Countries and were prominently illustrated in paintings of fashionable gallery interiors there.\n\nFor compositional subtlety, sensuous tactile values and sheer technical virtuosity, Giambologna\u2019s work is virtually unequalled in any period or country.",

            "historical_context_note": "In 1560 a commission for a Fountain of Neptune for the Piazza della Signoria, Florence, which had previously been allocated to Baccio Bandinelli, fell vacant on his death. A competition was held to decide which of the available sculptors should receive the commission. Bartolomeo Ammanati won, through influence at the Medici court and the support of Michelangelo from Rome, but the young Giambologna\u2019s full-size model (destr.) was highly praised by another great sculptor, Leone Leoni, in a letter to none other than Michelangelo.\n\nIn view of this achievement, Giambologna received his first major commission from Prince Francesco de\u2019 Medici, for an over life-size group in marble depicting Samson Slaying a Philistine (1560\u201362). The subject and treatment were derived from a project of Michelangelo\u2019s from the 1520s involving Samson and Two Philistines; this got no further than the stage of a model and is known only from a series of bronze aftercasts (e.g. Florence, Bargello, sometimes attributed to Pierino da Vinci). Francesco\u2019s and Giambologna\u2019s intention was therefore to render in marble (as originally intended) what might have been Michelangelo\u2019s most magnificent sculptural composition, embodying as it did all his theoretical ideals: a pyramidal or conical volume, with a flame-like contour to suggest movement, and three figures unified in action. Giambologna created a distinct variation on the theme, however, by removing the third, dead, figure from the base, thus enabling him to pierce the lower part of the pyramidal block of marble with a series of interstices, which penetrate daringly into and through the depths of the block. The technical problems involved in excavating the marble to this extent were enormous, but Giambologna welcomed the opportunity of demonstrating his virtuosity, in imitation of such Hellenistic groups as the Farnese Bull (Naples, Mus. Archeol. N.), which he had seen in Rome.\n\nLater (1569\u201370) Giambologna created an oddly shaped basin, with monsters supporting it, for a fountain that he crowned with his earlier group of Samson. It is quadrilobed in plan, with four great fungus-like protrusions instead of the normal circular basin; bronze monkeys cavorted in niches below.\n\nTaunted by the Philistines, Samson, wielding an ass's jawbone, slew a thousand of them until they lay in 'heaps and heaps' .After this labour God caused water to flow from the jaw-bone for him to quench his thirst.  \n\nSamson, one of the Old Testament Judges, is portrayed in The Bible as being of great physical strength and a womanizer. It is likely that some such historical figure existed whose legendary feats were kept alive in local story telling. The biblical author enlarged and embellished them to serve the religious and patriotic ends of Israel. The Medieval Church regarded him as one of the prefigurations of Christ. He is also the prototype of fortitude whose emblem is a broken pillar.",
