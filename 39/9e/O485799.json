            "physical_description": "Man's robe of dragon-patterned silk.\n\nOn a deep yellow satin ground, the design is brocaded in gold thread, red, white and blue silk, bound with a proportion of the warp. The width of each panel of silk is approximately 22.5 inches, and contains only half the design.\nLarge dragons with gold scales outlined in blue, wreathed in red and blue clouds, spring upwards to clutch the sacred disc. These two-toned, five-clawed dragons fill the whole length of the robe; one on each side of the front, and one on the back, with smaller dragons on each sleeve. Their features are unusually bold. At the hem of the garment are the usual rocks rising from waves in which are also branches of coral, gold circular ornaments (yuan sheng) and gold rectangular ornaments (fang sheng.\n \nThe robe is long and ample, with fairly straight-cut, long sleeves, a high neck, and the front fastened by a single button. The robe has been altered or awkwardly put together from a restricted amount of silk for an extra strip of material about 4 inches wide is inserted round the area of the waist, and pieces are patched together without regard for pattern under the overlapping front. The lining is of dark blue silk damask with a small pattern of the eight buddhist symbols; with an edging of red silk damask patterned with cloud bands and small dragon roundels.\n\nThe silk is Chinese, but the robe was probably made into its present form in Tibet. It is reputed to have been worn by a high-ranking Tibetan Lama. Schuyler Cammen: \"China's Dragon Robes, pp.173-4 mentions: \n\na) that early Tibetan robes tended to have \"long narrow sleeves without cuffs; extending a foot or so beyond the hands of the wearer and have unslit skirts\", as does this robe, \n\nb) that a modern book on Tibet mentions the highest rank of laymen as well as lamas, wearing robes of royal yellow with dragon designs, \n\nc) that photographs of the highest Tibetan nobles in Lhasa show them in dragon robes of archaic design with large single dragons down front and back, similar in style to dragons on early Qing robes. The dragons on this robe are also of early Qing type.",

A deep blue silk with a design of Buddhist motifs is edged with red silk bearing cloud bands and dragon roundels. These rich red facings seem to have been especially favoured in Tibet. The scale of the designs on these lining silks is small and contrasts with the large-scale dragon motif curling up the front and back of the outside of the garment. This yellow dragon silk as well as the blue and red lining materials were all woven in China, a regular source of fine textiles, not only for Tibet, but also for other Himalayan Buddhist states. This Tibetan robe echoes the design on dragon robes worn in China by male officials of the imperial bureaucracy and it would have played a similar role in Tibet.  The wearer is likely to have come from one of Tibet's noble families who were obliged to reside in the capital, Llasa, to carry out government duties. These details shows the inside of the front overlap section that fastens across the chest.",
