The box is int he form of a shallow vase, with concave sides about a convex, gadrooned lower section. The lid, veneered on the inside, is fitted with a lock and there is a keyhole on the vertical upper section of the box.\n\nThe inside of the box is veneered and a veneered circular panel is fitted halfway down the box. Below this panel the lower part of the box is lined with red baize. The panel is pierced with four round openings, two large and two slightly smaller, arranged in a circle alternately large and small.  The two larger holes are fitted with removeable circular caddies, both veneered and each with a hinged lid and foil lining. The two smaller holes are now empty but may have originally been fitted with cut-glass bowls, which stood on circular raised bases visible through the holes. \n\nThe spiral-twist stand ends in a gadrooned collar above the tripod base. The feet have flat sides and shaped tops with rounded ends above the castors. There is a turned pendant below the centre of the tripod base and small bosses on each flat side of the feet.",

The carved mouldings and spiral twist stand show that the tea poy was in the Jacobean revival style, very fashionable in the 1840s, as was the use of walnut as a decorative veneer. The size and shape, and the use of castors, made the tea poy a practical piece of furniture which could be moved into position for making and serving tea. The interior is fitted with removeable tea caddies and with spaces for cut-glass bowls. These bowls, which are now missing, were used for mixing tea and for sugar. T.H. Filmer, whose label is stuck to the underside of the caddies, established a cabinet making and upholstery firm in Berners Street, near Oxford Street, London, in 1835 and the firm remained in business until at least the late 1860s.",

He is listed at No. 28 Berners Street in the Post Office Street Directory of 1846, with both Nos. 28 & 32 Berners Street listed in the 1854 edition. By the time of the 1866 edition the firm has become Thomas Henry Filmer & Sons, upholsterers &c. 28, 29, 31 & 32 Berners Street W. & 34 Charles Street, Middlesex Hospital, W.\n\nSeveral pieces of furniture survive with the firm's label, which is either on printed paper for earlier pieces, or a stamped oval brass label giving 28, 32 & 54 Berners St. Oxford Street.  These surviving pieces include examples of extending tables, using the method patented in 1835 by Robert Jupe for increasing the diameter by inserting extra leaves.\n\nAlthough T.H. Filmer is not listed as an exhibitor at the Great Exhibition held in London in 1851, Filmer and Sons did participate in the London International Exhibition in 1862 where their display included an extending table using a screw and cog mechanism by Samuel Hawkins, illustrated in <u>The Art Journal Illustrated Catalogue</u>, 1862, page 58. According to the<u> Official Illustrated Catalogue of the International Exhibition, London, 1862</u>, vol. II, Class XXX, p.12, some of the furniture exhibited by Filmer & Sons was based on prize competition drawings by students of the South Kensington School of Art.\n\n The firm also exhibited at the <u>Exposition Universelle</u> held in Paris in 1867 where their display included another novel example of furniture design, a 'fauteuil' or conversation seat . This was composed of two sofas and two armchairs, which could also be used as separate pieces, a design which was selected for praise by <u>The Art Journal Illustrated Catalogue 1867</u>, p. 110.",
