Maureen was an amateur toymaker who found success in the 1980s with her handmade soft toys and puppets.\n\nThese puppets are softer and more tactile than earlier Punch and Judy sets; the faces are made of felt and the bodies are shaped to comfortably fit a child's hand. Rather than being carved of wood, the heads are stuffed with soft material. \n\nPunch and Judy was popularised throughout the nineteenth century as an entertainment for children. However,  the main character was a British incarnation of Pulcinella, a violent yet humourous clown from the earlier Italian tradition of Commedia dell'Arte. This was an improvised theatrical form performed and watched by adults.",
