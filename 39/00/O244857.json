Princess Margaret is standing, with her arm around her elder sister's shoulders. The girls wear matching gowns with puffed sleeves, and pearl necklaces. Their dresses are embroidered with sequins in bow-like shapes. A vase of chrysanthemums is seen towards the lower left of the image. A backdrop depicts an enlarged and adapted section of 'Le Petit Parc' by the French painter Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard (1732-1806). Beaton has appropriated the pose of the princesses from that depicted in Thomas Gainsborough's (1727-1788) 1763-4 painting 'The Artist's Daughters, Molly and Peggy'.",
