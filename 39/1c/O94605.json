The design appears to have been influenced by Maeterlinck, the Belgian poetic dramatist and essayist and one of the leading figures in the Symbolist movement.  He achieved great contemporary popularity with his play, L'Oiseau Bleu (The Blue Bird) which was first performed in 1908.  In his youth, Ramsden was an active and keen promoter of amateur dramatics.",
