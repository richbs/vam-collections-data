In a statement made in 1988 he averred that printmaking was a seminal activity for him, which significantly affected his development as an artist, particularly the way he continued to draw and he confessed to sometimes having a longing to make prints. \n\nThis somewhat fantastical image shows a knight on horseback bearing a military standard, accompanied by a soldier with a drum, both advancing before an armoured tank through a devastated landscape. In a vague way the image is reminiscent of Albrecht Durer's print 'Knight, Death and the Devil' and possibly Sandle was deliberately invoking this time-honoured image of the futility of war and valour. As with many of his prints of the 1980s this image appears to be influenced by Vorticism or Futurism, artistic movements of the early 20th century which looked to the machine as an aesthetic inspiration.",
