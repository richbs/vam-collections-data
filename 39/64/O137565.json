            "public_access_description": "Albrecht D\u00fcrer produced many portraits which were either drawn or painted, but made comparatively few printed portraits. His subjects were his friends and associates but also leading figures in politics, religion, science and the arts as well as key figures involved in the Reformation. Some of these portraits were for private use while some were designed from the outset for public display. By the time of producing this print D\u00fcrer was an accomplished master of engraving. \n\nFrederick the Wise, Elector of Saxony (1463-1525), the subject of this print, was one of D\u00fcrer's earliest significant patrons. The print was done a year before the death of Frederick and is based on a silverpoint drawing made by D\u00fcrer now in the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Paris. The drawing was presumably made during a visit by Frederick to Nuremberg in 1522-23, where D\u00fcrer had his workshop. The print from this drawing is small and intimate. D\u00fcrer shows the Elector, almost full-face, filling the whole space, and demonstrates the artist's technical mastery of engraving in the detail of the Elector's voluminous beard and the intricacies of the fur mantle. D\u00fcrer shows the reflection of a window in the eyes of his sitter, a device often used by the artist in his portraits. On either side of the head are the coat of arms of the Prince Elect of Saxony to the left and the Dukedom of Saxony to the right. The lettering in Latin on the tablet in front of the Elector reads 'Sacred to Christ. He favoured the word of God with great piety, worthy to be revered by posterity forever. Albrecht D\u00fcrer made this for Duke Frederick of Saxony, Arch-Marshal, Elector of the Holy Roman Empire....'. Frederick is remembered as the man who saved Martin Luther from the fury of the Catholic Church. Following Luther's excommunication in 1521 he ensured his safe protection in Wartburg Castle.",

To D\u00fcrer's relief, the Elector ensured the safe protection of Luther in his castle at the Wartburg when the reformer's life was endangered following his excommunication in 1521. Friedrich the Wise was D\u00fcrer's earliest significant patron, and his commission of a painted portrait in 1496 was a major work that stimulated others to patronize the young artist. Friedrich's later commissions included D\u00fcrer's magnificent 'Adoration of the Magi' of 1504 and the 'Martyrdom of the Ten Thousand' in 1508 as well as other altarpieces.\n\nThis engraving shows an elderly Friedrich the year before his death. It is based on a silverpoint drawing in Paris (Ecole des Beaux-Arts; Strauss 1524/I). As with his portrait of Ulrich Varnb\u00fcler (cat. no. 163), D\u00fcrer has taken the unusual step of signing the print in full, [as well as including his monogram AD which appears above the left shoulder of the sitter].\n\nFrom 'Albrecht D\u00fcrer and His Legacy - The Graphic Work of a Renaissance Artist', Giulia Bartrum with contributions by G\u00fcnter Grass, Joseph L.

The engraving is based on a prepartory drawing (SD.1524/1), presumably drawn during Frederick's stay in Nuremberg between November 1522 and February 1523. As in most of his later portraits, D\u00fcrer shows the reflection of a window in the pupils of his sitter, perhaps symbolizing the eye as the window of the soul.'",
