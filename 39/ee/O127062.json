It may have been made as a study in its own right, rather than as a model for a larger work.\n\nJohn Flaxman (1755-1826) as sculptor, designer and teacher was a major proponent of the neo-classical style in Britain, and his numerous church monuments and portrait busts exemplify the style he had absorbed in Rome, where he worked from 1787 to 1794. He was a member of the Royal Academy, and gave important lectures on sculpture there, in which he singled out Michelangelo and Canova as great sculptors, and disparaged Bernini and the baroque style. A large collection of his plaster models is held in the Strang Print Room, University College, London. He also made outline illustrations of Homer, Aeschylus and Dante. Many of those in his sketchbooks (now in the V&amp;A) were drawn from the antique while he was in Italy. Furthermore he produced models for pottery and silver supplying the pottery manufacturer Josiah Wedgwood among others. He thus can be considered as an important pioneer in the development of Industrial Design.",
