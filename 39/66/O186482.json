Richardson was Soane's assistant in 1824-1837 and may have altered the original design as no known Soane scheme corresponds with the elevation as shown here. \n\nThe origins of the project stretch back to the summer of 1779 when Soane was in Parma. While there, he decided to enter the prize competition to be staged the following spring by the academy of that city. The prescribed subject for this open student competition was Castello d'Aqua, or waterworks. With the help of his friend, the amateur architect Thomas Pitt, Soane picked his way through a welter of different plan types and elevations, some al antica some in 'modern' vein. In the winter the form crystallised in along the lines shown in the Richardson's plan. \n\nA Pantheon-domed water tank fed outlying reflecting pools and corner fountains. The plan derived from Soane's own James King Mausoleum. Richardson's rusticated elevation is faithful to the spirit of Soane's but altered the architectural order. Soane employed a baseless Doric because of its primitive overtones and Richardson's are encrusted with an exaggerated vermiculation that gives the shafts the appearance of being fur-jacketed in an almost Mannerist fashion.",
