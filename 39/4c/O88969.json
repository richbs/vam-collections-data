Power produced several botanical illustrations around the year 1800. The artist's work is on vellum and in the style of Georg Dionysus Ehret (1708-70), and it is possible that he or she was one of his many pupils.\n\nThis species of Hydrangea was introduced to Europe from Japan around 1780. It is a very difficult plant to draw, with the tight bunching of petals on the flower head. Here the artist has chosen to present the plant in a rather flat and diagrammatic style. It is a competent drawing, and accurately represents the botanical details. But it is slightly stiff and formal, which suggests the work of an amateur rather than a professional artist.",
