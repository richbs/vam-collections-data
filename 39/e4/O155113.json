His documentation of the years he knew them, from 1963 to his death a decade later, has ensured that his name is synonymous with the band.\n\nHe was also involved with the London art scene of the sixties. The Robert Fraser Gallery in Duke Street, Mayfair - to which Cooper became attached in 1964 - played host to the incipient Pop Art movement as well as to establised names such as Jean Dubuffet and Rene Magritte.\n\nThis portrait, taken at the Democratic Party Convention in Chicago in 1968, shows a group of writers and poets from the 'beat generation' - Terry Southern, Allen Ginsberg, Jean Genet and William Burroughs.",
