He worshipped, and informed the King of what he had seen; the Monarch was commanded by the god in a vision to erect a temple in the wilderness over his image. He accordingly set about building the Pagoda which he completed; and the Town of Madura at the same time. Shortly afterwards the king had a daughter supernaturally born to him, whom Shiva afterwards made his consort, or more correctly speaking Parvati became incarnate as the daughter of Malaya Dhuraja King of Madura, son of Kalashekhara Pandyan; After the death of that King, Shiva in person ruled Madura under the name of Sundara or Sundareswara Pandyan\u2026'",

It was written off in 1937, and rediscovered and re-evaluated in the 1990s. See Dewan p.423 for listings of other copies elsewhere.\nThis photograph was published as plate I of fifteen in the album <u>Photographs of Madura: Part III</u> 1858, by 'Captain L. Tripe, Government Photographer', published in 1860. It was taken as part of Tripe's remit as the government photographer, which he himself defined broadly, as recording, \u2018before they disappear\u2019 buildings, sculptures and inscriptions\u2026' including the picturesque. This was a model for an extensive survey, including tuition of others and experimentation in his own practice. He was funded by the Madras government, but intended selling additional copies of some prints so that his practice could be self-funding.\n\nThis photograph was published without any text specific to it, but following a large section of text about the great pagoda:\n\u2018The following pictures are representations of various parts of the great Pagoda of Madura, dedicated to [the Hindu god] Shiva, under the name of Sundareshwaran or Chokkalingum, \u2018lord of beauty,\u2019 and his consort Parvati, commonly called by the Sanscrit name Minakshi, or in Tamil Ankayal-Kannammal, meaning \u2018the fish-eyed one,\u2019 she whose eyes resemble the fish termed in Tamil kayal.\n[The legend of the temple is as follows.]\n\u2026In the days of Kalashekhara Pandyan whose Metropolis was at Manav\u00far, one Dhananjaya, a merchant, was benighted in the forest, or [Sic;of] Kadamba trees (Nauclea cadamba) which overspread the Peninsula after the deluge, and discovered the image under a tree. He worshipped, and informed the King of what he had seen; the Monarch was commanded by the god in a vision to erect a temple in the wilderness over his image. He accordingly set about building the Pagoda which he completed; and the Town of Madura at the same time. Shortly afterwards the king had a daughter supernaturally born to him, whom Shiva afterwards made his consort, or more correctly speaking Parvati became incarnate as the daughter of Malaya Dhuraja King of Madura, son of Kalashekhara Pandyan; After the death of that King, Shiva in person ruled Madura under the name of Sundara or Sundareswara Pandyan\u2026\u2019\n\nHistorical significance: Tripe's photographs of South India are an important body of work within Tripe's oeuvre, and are recognised as being some of the most aesthetically and technically competent images of India made in the 19th century.\nTripe entered his Madura series as part of total of 50 photographs from his 1857\u20138 tour of South India in the 1859 annual exhibition of the Madras Photographic Society. The jury dubbed his photographs \u2018the best in the Exhibition\u2019 but as Tripe could not be classed an amateur, he could not win the gold medal. Tripe declined the silver medal amicably, since he considered that as an official photographer he had an unfair advantage over the other entrants. \nTripe\u2019s photographs were valued for their informational value and their technical quality. The adjudicating committee stated that Tripe\u2019s photographs \u2018illustrate admirably the architecture of the Hindoo Temples and Places of Southern India, and in particular the Madura and Tanjore series comprise in this respect all that is most worthy of record in those cities.\u2019 (See Dewan, p.16). Forty-six of Tripe\u2019s 50 exhibited images were made from paper (calotype) negatives, which the committee didn't feel were as successful as dry collodion-on-glass negatives, however, declaring that \u2018the superiority of definition given by Collodion [-on-glass] is very visible when placed side by side with them.\u2019 It is thought that Tripe prefered paper to glass negatives due to paper being easier and safer to work with.",

            "historical_context_note": "<b>The southern districts tour and Madras presidency photographs, 1857-58</b>\nThe Madras government appointed Tripe as photographer following the 1855 directive from the Court of Directors in London, who discouraged illustration in favour of 'photography as a means by which representations may be obtained of scenes and buildings, with the advantages of perfect accuracy, small expenditure of time, and moderate cash', and asked that photography be the main means of recording architecture and antiquities (Dewan, p.6).  \n\nAs official photographer to the Madras Government, Tripe set off from Bangalore on 14 December 1857 after delays due to waiting for modifications to his new English camera, and his recovery after falling from a horse. He ended his tour in Madras on 30 April 1858 after travelling via Srirangam, Tiruchchirappalli, Madurai, then Pudukkottai, Tanjore, and Tiruchchirappalli again (then called Seeringham, Trichinopoly, Madura, Poodoocottah and Tanjore). \n\nAll of these areas had been forcefully taken under British rule in the previous one hundred years, but Tripe looked for scenes or subjects with architectural or antiquarian interest rather than political significance. He had wanted to ensure his images were practical too: before he had set out he had asked the chief engineer for guidance on what would be most useful from an engineering perspective, and incorporated this input into his work.",
