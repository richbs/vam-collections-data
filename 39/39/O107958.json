His distinctive clothes are worn by the famous although it remains to be seen how much he can keep his style in the public eye once the initial interest has worn off.\n\nSee for example:\nSunday Telelgraph: The Telegraph Magazine, 22 June, 1996\n London Evening Standard, Tuesday, 24 September, 1996\nThe Art Newspaper, no. 69, April, 1997\nLondon Evening Standard, Wednesday, 17 March, 1999\n\nHistorical significance: David Tang could be called a Chinese nationalist as he celebrated Hong Kong's return to the People's Republic of China in 1997 with special Chinese-made clothes & a clever advertising campaign, while others were not so jubilant about relinquishing British rule. For some, 1997 represented a poignant moment at the end of Empire.",
