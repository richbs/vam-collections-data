During the next century, clockmaking developed as a particular technical skill. Clocks became popular status symbols and were produced in large numbers throughout Europe. George Etherington (died 1739), the maker of this clock, was admitted to the Clockmakers' Company in London in 1684. Nearly thirty years later he was considered of sufficient status to stand as Master of the Company for one year.  A large number of clocks by him are known, many of them longcase clocks, which now carry the popular name of 'grandfather clocks'.  Like many such clocks, this one has lost the lower plinth to its base, and the coved top called a 'caddy top', which would originally have made it at least 20 cm taller.\n\nOn loan to National Trust Gladstone's Land.",
