ISBN 1851773088.\nThis plaster cast after Michelangelo's marble original, 1504-06, in the church of Notre-Dame, Bruges, Belgium, was acquired from the Belgian government in 1872 through the international exchange scheme initiated by Henry Cole. The agreement - for the \"\"promotion of art\"\" - facilitated exchange between museums across Europe of reproductions of objects in their respective countries. The document concluding this agreement, the International Convention, was signed by the fifteen crowned princes of Europe in 1867 at the Paris Exhibition. With the aid of this agreement, the South Kensington Museum was able to amass a collection of casts unrivalled in its international scope and diversity.\nIn 1863, in his capacity as \"\"Art Referee\"\" (advisor on acquisitions), J.C.Robinson visited Bruges. In his report to Cole, he enthused over the Madonna and Child he saw at Notre-Dame and urged that a cast be made. While not disregarding the question of the \"\"genuineness\"\" of the group as the work of Michelangelo, Robinson nonetheless went on to describe it as \"\"one of the most highly finished, complete and most beautiful works of the great master\"\", concluding, \"\"the great merit of the work and its importance in the history of art, would I think fully justify the outlay attending its reproduction.\"\" The cast was not acquired by the Museum until 1872, however, when procedures for acquiring reproductions had been formalised by the International Convention. In its year of acquisition, the cast was lent to the international exhibition held in London, where it was displayed in a gallery devoted to art reproductions. In the exhibition catalogue and in the original Museum register entry, the cast is recorded as being from an original \"\"attributed\"\" to Michelangelo, illustrating once again the shift in thinking as to the authorship of the group.\nThe cast of the Bruges Madonna is today displayed alongside other casts of sculpture by Michelangelo in the east Cast Court, devoted entirely to reproductions of Italian works of art. It is probable that the surface of this cast was left unfinished - showing the casting seams - to illustrate the complex network of piece moulds required to make such a reproduction.\n\nDIANE BILBEY\nTrusted, Majorie. ed. <u>The Making of Sculpture: the Materials and Techniques of European Sculpture.</u> London: V&A Publications, 2007. p. 162. pl. 311.",
