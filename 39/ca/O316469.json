            "public_access_description": "After Queen Victoria wore white satin for her 1840 wedding, white became established as a fashionable colour for bridal gowns. For most nineteenth century brides, a wedding dress was an expensive purchase which was expected to be worn many times after the ceremony. Many brides chose coloured day dresses to wear for \"best\" afterwards, but there were other ways to prolong the life of a fashionable white wedding dress beyond its original wearing.\n\nThis dress illustrates two methods. It was made with removable longer sleeves to enable it to be worn both as a day dress and as a short-sleeved evening gown. The rich silk satin is said to have been re-dyed red, but a close examination of the dress does not support this story. Some brides did have their white dresses dyed, and a coloured dress would have been more practical in the longer term than white. A re-dyed dress could then have been worn for a number of years afterwards.\n\nThe dress is said to have been worn by Agnes Eleanor Hubbersty when she married Nicholas Price Wood in Darley, North Yorkshire, on 27 April 1843.",

The parish records as well as memorials in the parish church of Wirksworth (in Derby) between 1600-1900 have been made available online, and reveal that Agnes Eleanor Hubbersty (15 May 1812-December 8 1892) married Nicholas Price Wood, a banker and solicitor. She was the daughter of the Reverend Nathan Hubbersty BD (1767-1828) , formerly headmaster of Wirksworth grammar school, and Mary Dorothy Hubbersty (n\u00e9e Tomlinson) (1777-1852).\n\nFurther research uncovered that Nicholas Price Wood was born 19 Feb 1810 at Brownhills, and died at Wirksworth Hall on 10 July 1868. It also revealed that he and Agnes were married on 27 April 1843 (rather than 1848) at Darley, North Yorkshire.\n\nThe dress does not appear to have been re-dyed, so was possibly always red.",
