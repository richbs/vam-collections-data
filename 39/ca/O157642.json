The body has a flattened base and applied panels of shellwork at the junctions with the feet.  A cast coat of arms for Sir John Campbell (showing the arms of Campbell with Pershall in pretense surrounded by the badge of the Order of the Bath) is applied to the front and back. The upper part of the body is chased with shells, scrolls, a goat mask, and faun masks on punched matted ground.  The spout is shaped as a bird's head, with a carved wooden spigot in the form of a crest.  The scroll handles are chased with foliage and surmounted by a female head.  The hinged, domed cover, chased similarly to the upper part of the body, has an ovolo border and flame finial.  The lamp is also of inverted baluster form chased with flowers and rococo cartouches on a matted ground; it is engraved four times with a crest and coronet.",

Sir John Campbell (1696-1782), for whose home it was made, served as ambassador to Russia, Lord of the Admiralty and Keeper of the Privy Seal.\n\nWhen the Catholic King Louis XIV revoked the religiously tolerant Edict of Nantes in 1685, Huguenots (French Protestants) were forced to leave the country. Many were craftsmen who settled in London.  Their technical skills and fashionable French style ensured the luxury silver, furniture, watches and jewellery they made were highly sought after.  Huguenot specialists transformed English silver by introducing higher standards of craftsmanship. They promoted new forms, such as the soup tureen and sauceboat, and introduced a new repertoire of ornament, with cast sculptural details and exquisite engraving.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
