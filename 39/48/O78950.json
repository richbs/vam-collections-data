It has an upholstered seat and back which are covered with embroidery in coloured wool on canvas ground, with a walnut frame. Its back and seat depict two different scenes.\n\nMaterials & Making\nNeedlework in wool on canvas was considered to be the most durable form of upholstered seat covering, and was sometimes made by the ladies of the house. Contemporary book illustrations were used as sources for the needlework patterns.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe back shows a pastoral scene: two figures in fanciful costume with a cauldron. The seat shows a scene from Aesop's Fables: a crane thrusting its bill down the throat of a wolf (from 'The Wolf and the Crane').Further Information\nInvestigation of the under upholstery has revealed that the present 18th-century needlework did not originally belong to the chair. It was applied in the late 19th- or early 20th century. The chair legs originally had rimmed feet.",
