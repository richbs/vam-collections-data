Her photographic work explores Britain\u2019s hidden histories associated with Africa and the Caribbean and is often personal, reflecting her own experiences as a black, British, woman artist. She has received a number of awards and commissions and has had her work published in numerous magazines and books. Her work is held by Arts Council England and the National Trust as well as by the V&A, which holds her series Pastoral Interludes. \n\nSelf-Evident is a series of eight portraits of black men and women posed in English countryside scenes.  Each of them holds an object associated, with the Afro-Carribean diaspora.  These range from tropical flowers and a conch shell to objects with more stereotypical connotations such as fried chicken and watermelon.  These carefully composed, square format images will build on the V&A\u2019s existing holdings by Pollard, which are made with a different technique of hand-coloured gelatin silver prints combined with text.",
