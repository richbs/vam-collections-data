Most European cultures disapproved of male jewellery, but buttons allowed men to show off their wealth and status.  They wore them in extravagant numbers, on sleeves and trousers as well as jackets and waistcoats.  The most popular kinds, throughout the region, were round filigree buttons, which varied in design and details of construction from place to place.  \n\nSilver filigree buttons, with round granules for decoration, were called \u2018braamknopen\u2019 (blackberry buttons) in Dutch.  They are now considered typical of Zeeland, but in the 18th and early 19th century they were worn throughout the Netherlands, and along the North Sea coast of Germany as well.  These buttons, with little pyramids instead of granules, may be Dutch, but are more likely to be German.  They date from the early 19th century.",
