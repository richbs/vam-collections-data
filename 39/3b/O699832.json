            "historical_context_note": "The present drawing represents a bird identified as a European Roller (Coracias garrulous). This species occurs as two subspecies: the nominate breeds from Morocco, south-west and south-central Europe and Asia Minor east through north-west Iran to south-west Siberia (Russia); and semenowi, which breeds in Iraq and Iran (except north-west) east to Kashmir and north to Turkmenistan, south Kazakhstan and north-west China (west Sinkiang). \n\nThis drawing was originally part of Cassiano dal Pozzo\u2019s Museum Chartaceum (Latin for \u2018Paper Museum\u2019; now Windsor Castle, Royal Lib., and London, British  Museum). \nCassiano dal Pozzo (1588-1657) was a renowned scholar and patron who assembled a vast collection of paintings, medals and books but also drawings and in particular drawings of antiquities and natural history subjects.\n\nThe drawings were commissioned from major and minor artists, including Pietro da Cortona, Pietro Testa and Vincenzo Leonardi, as well as collected from other sources. The present drawing has been attributed to Vincenzo Leonardi (1590\u2013c.1648), who worked for Cassiano from at least 1621 until 1646, providing mainly natural history subjects His style is characterised by the use of a sophisticated layering of watercolour and bodycolour.\n\nCassiano\u2019s intention was to form a visual encyclopaedia of the ancient and natural worlds but his project was never published. A group of drawings were however reproduced in a number of books on natural history, and artists and scholars drew on its fund of images of the Classical world. (See other examples in the collection: E.2776-1962, E.426-2009 and E.1026-2011.)",
