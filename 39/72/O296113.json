Men often wore these in extravagant quantities with traditional costume, at their collars and cuffs, as well as to fasten shirts, jackets, and waistcoats.  \n\nThis pair of buttons was worn to hold the neck of the shirt closed.  The use of buttons as collar links precedes their use in fastening clothes in most northern countries, and the buttons used in this way come in many patterns.  These buttons, made from strands of twisted wire arranged in a plaited pattern over a solid base, are unusual, but there is no reason to doubt their origin.  They were described as being worn by the peasantry of Emden, when they were bought for the Museum, for five shillings (for three pairs) at the International Exhibition, London, 1872.",
