The density of warp threads has been reduced across the top band of the field.\n\nWeft: brown wool; Z2S; 2 shoots after each row of knots; 19 knots per inch (77 per dm).\n\nPile: wool and silk; 7 colours: dark red, red (wool) and pink (silk), yellow, dark green, dark blue, black; asymmetrical knot open to the left tied around 2 threads; 247 knots per sq. inch (4235 per sq. dm).\n\nSide Finish: incomplete but evidence on the right-hand side of one cord oversewn with red wool.\n\nEnd Finish: Lower: plain weave with red wool; cut. Upper: cut.\n\nDESIGN: Field: yellow ground with three bands of 12 curled leaf motifs in colours contrasting with confining hexagons, each having vertical, parallel sides with saw-toothed upper and lower sides plus an extruding stem that joins to make overall lattice. Fourth band (second from bottom) has 12 small curled leaves alternating with diagonally divided rectangles. Extra-worn leaves and whirls are in pink silk.\n\nMain border: dark red ground with a linked, small gul motif.\n\nInner and Outer borders: dark red ground with dark green and dark blue hexagonal cartouches, every fifth with a pink silk ground, each cartouche enclosing an S-motif.\n\nUpper Band: red silk ground containing black, hooked lozenges, each infilled with four yellow flowerheads.\nLower Band: red wool ground with small, blue crosses with the lower arms hooked and interspersed by small yellow flowerheads.",
