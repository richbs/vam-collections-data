She was 12 in 1757 so perhaps Susan received it as a gift or made it herself.   Her grandson recorded her name on a piece of parchment which was kept with the scoop as it was passed down through the family as an heirloom for nearly 200 years. \n\nSusan Keck was born in 1745 in Great Tew, Oxfordshire. Her father was a Member of Parliament and she later married Francis, Lord Elcho. Apple scoops such as this were evidently found in wealthy homes as well as modest ones. It is carved with geometric patterns and a little ball which moves inside the handle. Though this one is mainly decorative, it could be used for eating or removing the cores of apples.\n\nIt was given to the V&A in 1939 by a descendant who had no children to pass it on to.",
