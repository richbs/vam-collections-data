This particular one is most likely to be Greek, as it was described when it was acquired.  The delicate gilded silver filigree and the use of coral beads are both characteristic of the kind of high-quality jewellery made in Greece in the 19th century.\n\nIt would originally have had a small loop at each end.  Its owner would have tied a ribbon through these loops to fasten it round her neck.  Similar pieces were also worn across the forehead, but they usually have prominent decorative motifs in the centre.\n\n It was bought for \u00a31 1s at the International Exhibition, London, 1872.",
