In this article Honey draws a parallel between the style of painting on this jug and the enamelling on the cover and mounts of the jug in the Victoria and Albert Museum 9-1867. While this latter important item was painted and signed by the <i>hausmaler</i> Johann Schaper, the mounts are considered to be later. The cover of 9-1867 is illustrated Plate 1A. Honey suggests the use of strong colours, including a particular shade of orange, curious fully rounded vegetables (including bifurcated turnips), wavy ribbons and scrolls and naturalistic flowers link this enamelling to the present jug and to a fa\u00efence dish in Frankfurt illustrated Plate 1E (unsigned) and a jug in Berlin, Plate 1F, signed <i>I.H. </i> With reference to the distinctive manner of rendering the flowers: 'These flowers are in the very interesting naturalistic style which appeared towards the middle of the seventeenth century in some engravings of Nicolas Cochin of Troyes (b. 1610, d. 1686). His 'Livre nouveau de fleurs tr\u00e8s outil pour l'art d'orf\u00e8vrerie et autres' of 1645 included tulips, fritillaries, and other flowers, then in favour through the contemporary vogue of 'Dutch' gardening, all rendered in a charming stiff botanical style which was developed in France by the goldsmiths and jewellers, such as Gilles L\u00e9gar\u00e9, Fran\u00e7ois Lefebure and others in the so-called 'Louis Treize' enamels, and took on a softer, more luscious, quality in the engravings of J. B. Monnoyer (b. 1635, d. 1692) and Jean Vauquer (fl. circa 1670), the latter a jeweller who also published a book entitled 'Livres de fleurs propes pour peintres et brodeurs.' The Dutch goldsmiths naturally practised a similar style, and in Germany it was developed notably by Johannes Th\u00fcnkel (about 1665) and by Christoph Schmidt and other Augsburg engravers. Similar flowers were worked into English embroideries of seventeenth and early eighteenth-century date, and embossed in much Restoration silver.'\nSchmidt, R., Meisterwerke Deutscher Fayencekunst\nBosch, Helmut. <u>N\u00fcrnberger Hausmaler</u>, Klinkhardt &amp; Biermann, Munich, 1984.
