            "public_access_description": "Hans Rottenhammer (1564/65-1625) was born in Muncih and became the apprentice of the court painter Hans Donauer (c. 1540-1596). In the early 1590s, the painter set out for a long sojourn in Italy, more specifically in Venice and Rome where he is documented between 1591 and 1595. Back in Venice, Rottenhammer established a studio, which attracted collectors and great commissions. In 1606 he returned to Augsburg, where he stayed until his death. His sons Hans Rottenhammer II (1622-1668) and Domenikus Rottenhammer (1622-?) were also painters but almost none of their work has survived.\n\nThis small oil on quartz is a rare example of Rottenhammer's painted jewellery. It depicts a Virgin and Child with the Infant Saint John the Baptist and was probably executed while working in Italy, either in Venice or Rome between 1591 and 1606.",

Another version was exhibited in Jean-Luc Baroni's gallery, London, from 18th-31st Jan 2008.\nThis oil on quartz is an unusual support and technique for Rottenhammer best known for his numerous mythological and religious small scenes on copper. The quartz was used here to suggest the colour of the Virgin's dress and is used also to simulate the background. \nWhile in Italy, Rottenhammer absorbed the work of the great masters and this work is reminiscent of such compositions as Correggio's <i>Madonna of the Basket</i> (1524-The National Gallery, London), which indicates that it was probably executed while travelling in Italy between 1591 and 1606.",

This is a good example of the way in which the natural colour of the stone has been incorporated into the composition: the Virgin's purple dress is unpainted quartz. The reattribution of this work to a German artist shows how non-Italian artists successfully learned and practiced fashionable painting techniques associated with Italy.",
