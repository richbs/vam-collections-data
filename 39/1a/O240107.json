Each photograph has been mounted on card, annotated with the name of the sitter at the bottom and then inserted into the album.  \n\nAround 1880, a photographic portrait studio by the name of E. & J. Baldwin was commissioned to photograph a series of silhouettes, or 'shadow profiles', made earlier in the century. This represents an intersection of two methods of recording one's likeness, practiced almost one hundred years apart. It is interesting to consider that this family had its collection of silhouettes photographed, possibly for posterity, and fashioned a beautiful album in which to display them.",
