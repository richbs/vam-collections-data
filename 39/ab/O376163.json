These are separated from each other by plain cylindrical beads, some silver-gilt, and some silver.  At the front of the necklace there are three filigree pendants, possibly made of gold.  The central one is shaped like a crescent, with a piece of sheet gold shaped like a cross over a crescent on its front, and a rosette, set with a pearl, between the horns.  There are three leaf-shaped pendants hanging from the lower edge, with a pearl above the central one.  The two side pendants are smaller, shaped like an irregular rosette with a central pearl and three leaf-shaped pendants hanging from the lower edge.  At each end of the necklace is a short length of fine chain ending on one side with a ring and on the other with a curved hook.",
