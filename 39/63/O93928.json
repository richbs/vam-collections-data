            "public_access_description": "Ridolfo Sirigatti carved the portrait of his mother, Cassandra, dressed in rich materials. Though her fold-down collar is relatively simple for the time, her dress appears to be made of brocade in the pomegranate pattern popular in Florence. She wears a widow\u2019s veil in commemoration of her husband. In this treatise, the writer Raffaele Borghini described the veil as 'a wonderful thing, so delicately worked that one can see the light through it'.\n\nThis bust is a rare example of Ridolfo Sirigatti's activity as a sculptor (active ca. 1570-1600). Together with its companion piece, depicting Niccol\u00f2 Sirigatti (A.12-1961), it shows high technical skill and an unusual and original style in comparison with Florentine contemporary sculpture. The peculiar disposition of the shoulders in both busts, with the right one pulled slightly back from the rest of the figure, and the left pushed slightly forward, shows the artist's intention to give an impression of movement. The technical virtuosity, visible especially in the draping of the fabric, foreshadows the taste of seventeenth century Roman sculpture. It is possible to identify some elements that would appear in the sculptures by Pietro Bernini, who received his first artistic training from Rodolfo Sirigatti.",

The son of a rich textile merchant and of Cassandra, daughter of the painter Ridolfo Ghirlandaio, Ridolfo continued his father's mercantile activity and brought fame to his family by becoming one of the Knights of Santo Stefano (the order instituted by Grand-Duke Cosimo I de Medici) in 1581. \nHe was also very interested in the arts and practised sculpture. Before the discovery of the present bust and its pendant in 1961, his only documented work was a bust of grand-duke Francesco I in a niche in the fa\u00e7ade of the Palazzo dei Cavalieri di Santo Stefano in Pisa (Sirigatti only provided the model for the bust). He features as one of the four protagonists in Raffaele Borghini's art treatise Il Riposo (1584), as an art expert and collector. The bust can be identified with the marble head of \"his (Sirigatti's) mother, which enables us to see her as though she were alive\" mentioned in the dialogue between Ridolfo and the collector Bernardo Vecchietti. Borghini praised this bust not only for its likeness, but also for a detail which he noted with admiration: \"A wonderful thing about it is a most delicate veil, which he has placed on her head. It falls down on her shoulders and is carved free of the neck the whole way round, and it is so diligently worked that one can see the light through it.\"\n \nIt is inscribed with the sitter's name and the date on the socle (CASSANDRA GRILLA[N]DARIA NICOLAO SIRIGATTIO NVPTA MDLXXVIII). On the back there is another inscription, a dedication in which presents the bust as a tribute from Sirigatti to his mother: QVEM GENVI RODVLPHVS ANIMI CAVSA CAELAVIT (Ridolfo, whom I bore, sculpted this as a tribute of love).",
