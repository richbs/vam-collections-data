His second Christian name is wrongly given as John in DNB. Apprenticed for two years with James Baker Pyne in Bristol; a Member of the Bristol Sketching Club. Exhibited 17 works at the RA between 1833 and 1845, 14 at the BI 1840-45, and ten at the SBA 1836-40. Travelled extensively, making drawings which he used later for finished and exhibited paintings: seven months in Germany, Switzerland and Italy with the watercolourist George Fripp 1834-5, Greece, Egypt, Malta and Naples 1838-9, and Turkey 1843-5. Suffering from a heart condition, he died young in Bristol 8 September 1845. His studio sale was at Christie's 1-3 April 1846, and his work achieved high prices for some years after. A sketchbook and several watercolours are also in the V&A collections. \nLIT: \tArt Union 1845, p318 (obit); Art Journal 1864, pp293-5; N Solly Life of William James M\u00fcller 1875; C Bunt The Life and Work of William James M\u00fcller Leigh-on-sea 1948; William James M\u00fcller Bristol City Art Gallery exhibition catalogue 1962; there was an exhibition of M\u00fcller's work at the Tate Gallery 1985, but no catalogue seems to have been published. \nItalian Landscape \n1839-1900 Neg 18945 \nCanvas, 30.5 \u00d7 23.8 cm (12 \u00d7 9 3/8 ins) Signed and dated 'W M\u00fcller 43' br \nAshbee Bequest 1900 \n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
