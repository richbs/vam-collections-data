They were made in plain, lightweight silver such as this one but also in pewter or ceramic. Trencher salts took their name from the large piece of coarse bread or the wooden platter from which diners ate.\n\nDesign & Designing\nSalt was highly valued as preservative and flavouring and consequently salts were among the most important pieces of metalwork in a Tudor or Stuart household. Beautiful examples made of precious metals and gems were used to show wealth and status. These small salts represent the everyday, unadorned aspect of an object with great symbolic importance.\n\nThis salt and several other pieces of domestic silver were found in 1891 by a boy chasing rabbits at Stoke Prior, near Leominster. It is a particularly interesting group as this sort of relatively simple household silver rarely survives.",
