Re-dated to 1948 by Daw San San Maw; Ministry Archaeology, Rangoon, 1994\n\nAttribution note: Kengtung is noted for producing this type of gilded lacquer container. It is in the shape of a pyi-daung (rice basket) as originally these receptacles were baskets with carrying straps and is called ko kaw tee in the Shan language. The tribal figures are those from Kengtung State but still need identification.\nEmbellishments were added to attract Burmen and European buyers: -\na) Burmese peacock was added to appeal to Burmese market.\nb) High relief of the figures introduced around the turn of the 20th century.\nc) Signatures started with the commencement of European trade.\n(Further information from R.
