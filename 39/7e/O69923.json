Made for the Western market.  \nA rectangular chest with an everted base and overhanging lid that is slightly domed, with a recessed ledge running round the interior towards the bottom, probably to support a tray, now missing. \nThe four sides and lid of the chest are decorated with landscape and figural scenes, some of which allude, in an abbreviated form, to the <u>Genji monogatari</u> (Tale of Genji), the tenth century classic of Japanese literature.  The two women in court dress in a garden among other palatial buildings depicted on the front probably refer to 'Nowaki' (The Typhoon), chapter 28.  One side portrays a man in court attire with an attendant, representing Genji and an attendant from chapter 15, or Yugiri from chapter 28.  The other two main sides portray buildings among landscapes and have no traceable reference to specific chapters of the novel.  All four scenes are contained within a strip of thin gold foil, followed by a thicker zigzag.  The main decoration on lid depicts a palace garden with a complex interconnecting verandahs, bridges and a gateway within an ornate ogival cartouche formed by a strip of gold foil.  This is set against a geometric diaper pattern on the domed part within an outer key-fret border in thin slivers of mother-of-pearl.  The two semicircular end panels of the lid are each decorated with a flower-head among scrolling leaves.\nThe decoration is carried out throughout in gold and silver <i>hiramakie</i> and <i>takamakie</i>, inlaid with mother-of-pearl, gold, gold foil and <i>kirikane</i> on black lacquer ground.  The interior of the lid is decorated with a landscape within a kidney-shaped panel in gold on black lacquer.  The remaining parts of the interior of the lid and chest are covered with <i>nashiji</i>, while the underside of the chest is in plain black lacquer.",

The box was undoubtedly the result of a special commission and was modelled on contemporary Dutch wedding caskets. These Dutch caskets were usually made out of silver and filled with gold coins as a token of marriage.   \n\nHigh quality export lacquerware, such as this chest, was made to special order in Kyoto, Japan's former imperial capital. It was then transported to Deshima, a small island in Nagasaki harbour, for shipment abroad by Dutch merchants. During the late 17th century merchants of the Dutch East India Company were the only Europeans permitted to conduct trade in Japan.",
