Nine of the twelve loose leaves have been darkly over-printed with images of women taken from the realms of art history; for example, Botticelli's Venus, a Rembrandt woman, Tenniel's Alice in Wonderland, and an aboriginal figure.\n\nAs with much of Davis' work, 'Birthmark' suggests that notions of race and femaleness form ever-changing complex layers within an individual's personality and cannot be easily pinned down.\n\nThree of the leaves are over-printed with poems by Simon Perchik. The book's covering boards are made from thick corrugated card, again hand-torn and stained with ink.\n\nThe whole package, designed by A.S.C. Rower, is bound together with a length of rough baling twine which adds to the overall organic feel of the work and a pervasive earthiness suggestive of womanly fecundity.\n\nNAL copy is no. 57 in an edition of 150, signed by the artist, author and designer.",
