Webb's design won a competition in 1891 to provide an imposing fa\u00e7ade on its Cromwell Road side. We know this today as the main entrance, but up until the 1890s it was an uninviting, ramshackle area littered with temporary buildings. This southern extension to the V&A was completed in 1909.  Webb's drawings were publicly exhibited and reviewed by the architectural journals of the period. His design was described by the Building News as combining 'many of the beauties and artistic capabilities of the Romanesque with the grace and playfulness of Spanish Renaissance'. Part of the sequence of single statues spaced out along the frontage is visible in this design. The statues represent ten English painters, ten English craftsmen, six English sculptors, and six English architects including Thomas Chippendale, William Chambers, John Constable, G. F. Watts and William Morris. Webb's new scheme was inaugurated in 1899 by Queen Victoria, who decreed that the museum's name be changed on this occasion from the South Kensington Museum to the Victoria and Albert Museum.",
