Many combination weapons combined the growing popularity of firearms with an already proven and familiar weapon design, in this case a two-handed sword design popular in Central and Northern India. \n\nIn Europe and Asia from the 1500s there was an explosion of innovative and unusual designs produced to incorporate this new technology, often sponsored by heads of state. Henry VIII was an enthusiastic patron of new weapons technologies but their popularity seems to have been universal.  \n\nAfter the conflicts in India between the British and the French during the Seven Years War, new firearms technology was enthusiastically studied and adopted by many Indian rulers. This weapon incorporates an early 19th century English flintlock mechanism. English weapons using similar locks had helped successfully overthrow many powerful states such as the Marathas. It may have been partly because of this reputation that an English lock was used in this combination weapon.\n\nHowever, flintlocks were found to be more prone to mechanical failure in hot and dry climates. Simpler, more robust matchlock firearms remained popular in India throughout the 19th century.",
