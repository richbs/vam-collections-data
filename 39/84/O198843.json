Between the 1780s and the 1850s, middle and upper class girls, in particular, often used devices like this posture board, also known as a back board. It was placed across the back just above the waist with the elbows tucked behind its ends. This pulled the shoulders back, producing an upright stance, and encouraged the user to concentrate on keeping this position in order not to drop the board.\n\nSome educational reformers eventually concluded that this kind of method was too artificial, and that it led to vanity and self consciousness:\n'Miss Fanshaw, an erect stiffened figure, made her entr\u00e9e; and it was impossible not to perceive that her whole soul was intent upon her manner of holding her head and placing her elbows, as she came into the room. Her person had undergone all the ordinary and extraordinary tortures of back-boards, collars, stocks, dumbbells, &c.' \nA description of a teenage girl from 'The Good French Governess' by Maria Edgeworth (1831).",
