These seem to be additions to widen the panel whilst trying to keep to the pattern and colouring. A border has been added to the outer edges here; this may have come from the pair to this trouser panel as the design is the same. Directional design with the top of the pattern at the bottom of the panel, so that the wearer saw the correct pattern. There is a border along the bottom and also along the upper sides]: dark brown ground with segmented pattern of downward pointing red blossom alternating with a downward pointing stem of 3 white flowers.  Triangular motifs fill the intervening spaces.  Small isolated motifs are embroidered on the outer edge of the cotton.  A dark brown embroidered line begins at the top of the border and continues part of the way up the sides of the panel.\n\nThe main pattern is a series of diagonal lines from lower right to upper left.  These are chevron lines in pink and yellow.\nThere are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: dark blue ground with a group of 3 white flowers and a pink bird [with no legs] with a cluster of green, pink and yellow flowers above its wings.\n[2] wider stripes in three designs: [a] diamond segments, one with white and light blue and yellow flowers and one with a straight striped stem and 4 large pink blossoms; both facing towards the bottom.\n[b] circular group of white flowers alternating with a large pink blossom on a straight stem; both pointing straight down.\n[c] branching striped stems each with 4 flowers: blue, pink outlined with green, pink outlined with white and white and mauve buds; pink and mauve flower outlined with light blue, mauve and light blue outlined with yellow, pink outlined with white and the same buds. Each sprig is associated with a group of 4 white flowers.\n\nThreads: silk; 2S; red, pink, orange, white, green, light green, dark green, mauve, light mauve, yellow, dark brown, light blue, dark blue, blue.",
