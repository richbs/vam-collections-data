The upper course has five square marquetry panels, depicting the three Greek goddesses (or their Roman equivalents) who were judged by Paris, separated by scenes of fish swimming in the sea and the moon shining on Northern Europe. These square panels are divided by narrow arched panels decorated with marquetry peacock feathers. The bird itself, Juno's symbol, occupies the central panel in the pediment. The lower horizontal course combines three mirrored sections with recessed cupboards, on whose surfaces the narrative of the Judgement of Paris and its consequences is sketched out. On the right the winner's crown is flanked by the apple inscribed 'Detur pulchriori', and on the left a ship flanked by olives  represnts the Greeks departing to avenge Helen's abduction to Troy, leading to the Trojan War.\n[Cabinet] The lower section of the cabinet divides into three principal sections. In the centre section, two doors enclose the inner space which has a central, sliding removable shelf and a fixed shelf level to either side. The doors fasten with two sliding bolts on the left side, and a lock on the right.  In the right and left main sections of the lower part of the cabinet the space is divided horizontally by shelves, on top of which are small lockable cupboards. Above these small cupboards are drawers, which are pulled out by means of turned rails.\nThe surface decoration consists of similar pattern, stringing and marquetry as on the upper section of the cabinet, with two fine vignettes of symmetrical lilies on the central cupboard doors.\n[Drawer] Left hand drawer, the front face veneered in ebony with ivory inlay in the form of arcading; below a horizontal rail\n[Drawer] Right hand drawer, the front face veneered in ebony with ivory inlay in the form of arcading; below a horizontal rail\n[Shelf] Internal removable sliding shelf.",

Such pieces combined exotic materials, such as mother-of-pearl and ivory, and excellent construction. This cabinet is typical of such exhibition furniture.\n\nPeople\nBruce J. Talbert (1838-1881) was a successful commercial designer of metalwork, stained glass, wallpapers, textiles and furniture. He also published two books of designs for furniture, one of Gothic ideas in 1867, and another of Jacobean designs in 1867. The firm of Jackson & Graham, which made this cabinet, was established by Thomas Jackson and Peter Graham at 37 Oxford Street, London, in 1836. They expanded rapidly and their premises included both workshops and retail showrooms. The firm specialised in high quality furniture, using luxurious materials as seen in this cabinet.\n\nHistorical Associations\nThe International Exhibition held in Paris in 1878 offered Jackson & Graham the opportunity to display their finest products to a continental audience. and the firm won the Grand Prix d'Honneur for the British Section of the exhibition. The cabinet was bought by the Khedive of Egypt (the viceroy of Egypt during Turkish rule from 1867 to 1914) for \u00a32,000.",

Vol. xxiii, pp.39-60.\n'In 1878 [the year the Juno cabinet was made] Talbert had at least two years to live, and it is odd that little of his work can be firmly ascribed to this period; perhaps by then he was already an alcoholic.' p.41.\n'As a market-conscious commercial designer, Talbert could afford no lasting attachment to the Gothic forms which had made his name.' p.46.\nTalbert, Bruce James. <u>Examples of Ancient and Modern Furniture, Metalwork, Tapestries, Decorations &c</u>. London, 1876.\n'It has been said that the revival of the so-called Queen Anne style, has arisen almost entirely from the predilection of certain Artists for the furniture of that period.  Were this true, woodwork would have taken a very leading position and, so far as architecture is concerned, a false one.'\n'The man who wishes to design well, must needs have a great knowledge of, and a great reverence for, the good work of the past ages, even though he may believe that their days are not ours, and that the giving of our best efforts to meet the present wants, if honestly done, will likely be correct.'",

The Khedive apparently commissioned a room <i>en suite</i> at a cost of \u00a36,000, according to Talbert's obituary in a trade periodical, <u>The Cabinet Maker</u>, which also described the Juno cabinet as \"showing the versatility of Talbert's genius, and his power to grasp Classicism with the same success as Gothic and Old English\", <u>The Cabinet Maker & Art Furnisher</u>, vol. II, no.13, 1 July 1881, p.5.\n\nHistorical significance: The design for the Juno cabinet may have evolved from an earlier ebony and ivory cabinet illustrated in Talbert's second book, <u>Examples of Ancient and Modern Furniture, Metal Work, Tapestries, Decorations &c.</u>(London, 1876).  This earlier cabinet was designed to match some Indo-portuguese chairs illustrated in Shaw's <u>Ancient Furniture</u> (London, 1836).",
