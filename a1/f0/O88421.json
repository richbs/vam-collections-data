The two dragons on the sides turn to bite themselves, that on the front bites its tail, while the beast at the back scratches its neck with its left front paw. Originally the base had four feet of bone or walrus ivory. The feet were set at a sloping angle deep into the base, each held by two long pins. On of these pins survives. The base also may have had a copper-alloy plate on the underside, as this is scored with cross-hatched lines. This plate would probably have held in place the tapering rectangular-sectioned tang of the cross, which completely pierced the base through the centre.",

This pyramid-shaped carving, decorated with four grotesque animals, served as a base for a crucifix, which would have been fitted into the slot on the top.\nOriginally this base had four feet of bone or walrus ivory. The base also may have had a copper-alloy plate on the underside. This plate would probably have held in place the tapering rectangular-sectioned tang of the cross, which completely pierced the base through the centre. The iconography of the base - dragons or serpents biting themselves - is found on a number of Romanesque metal cross feet.",
