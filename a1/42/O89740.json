It shows a figure representing Learning - a young woman seated beneath a tree reading a book. By her side are a scroll, a pair of compasses, a book and a set square, with a landscape behind. Beneath is the legend: 'IN LABORE QUIES' (which can be translated as 'while you work, you rest'). It is signed 'O. Roty'.",
