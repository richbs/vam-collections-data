It was a present for Caroline, the daughter if the castle's owner Sir Robert Gordon, for her sixth birthday in August. It is quite a plain house with few outstanding features and is a good example of the type of house that was being made as a plaything for children to use, as opposed to more elaborate examples that adults would have had. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert rented the castle in 1848 and lived there until their new home at Balmoral was finished in 1855. Their children played with this house for many years.",
