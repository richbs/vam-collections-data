Before the First World War, the evening meal in middle-class households was a highly elaborate, formal affair in which many courses were served. The subsequent generation tended to favour a more simplified ritual with fewer courses, starting later in the evening. The cocktail hour was born! Cocktails were an American invention. They assumed widespread popularity, particularly during the era of Prohibition (1919\u201333). Cocktails could conveniently disguise the appearance of alcohol. But Prohibition failed to stop America drinking. As Gatsby, a character in Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s novel The Great Gatsby (1925), amply demonstrates, the rich never went thirsty. Organised crime saw to that. At Christmas 1933, after Prohibition was finally repealed, almost every middle-class household in America witnessed one spouse giving the other a cocktail shaker.\n\nIn Great Britain, cocktails became particularly fashionable when the Savoy Hotel opened its American Cocktail Bar in 1929. This was under the management of Harry Craddock, a legendary New York bar tender who had found it difficult to get legitimate work. One year later, Craddock\u2019s The Savoy Cocktail Book was published. It has since become the bible of the British cocktail trade. All the major West End retailers in luxury goods sold distinctive cocktail shakers. In their Christmas catalogue for 1933, Asprey\u2019s advertised three novelty cocktail shakers. One in silver in the shape of a ship\u2019s bell was on sale for the considerable sum of \u00a325.",

He began his career as an industrial designer, firstly as a glass designer for Stevens & Williams of Staffordshire and after the success of this range, as a designer of earthenware for Wedgwood which proved equally successful.  From 1934, he was also used as a designer for the Sheffield silversmiths, Mappin & Webb.  His work was successfully exhibited at the British Industrial Art Exhibition, Dorland Hall and the Milan Triennale, 1933, British Art and Industry, Royal Academy, 1935 and the Paris International Exhibition, 1937.  After 1938, he switched to architecture; the new Wedgwood factory at Barlaston being the first commission of his new career.",

            "historical_context_note": "Legend has it that the cocktail was invented during the American War of Independence in the early 1770s. A few of George Washington's troops were relaxing in The Four Corners Inn in upstate New York when the young Irish barmaid, Betsy Flanagan, who was administering to them decided to serve a new drink of her own making. Into each glass, she served a mixture of rum, rye whiskey and several fruit juices and, as a final flourish, decorated each glass with a feather plucked from the plump rooster of a nearby Loyalist farmer. Amidst much laughter as she served the drinks, a young French officer leapt to his feet and proclaimed, 'Vive le coq-tail' and so the cocktail was born. Cocktails were particularly in vogue during the interwar years of the 20th century. Although now internationally popular, cocktail drinking is particularly associated with the USA and the design of this shaker with its chrome finish and stepped decoration, has overtones of American Art Deco.\n[Eric Turner, 'British design at Home', p.149]",
