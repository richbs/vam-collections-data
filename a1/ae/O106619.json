            "public_access_description": "Sand casting used moulds of highly compacted, fine sand held in a frame. It was a less expensive method of casting suited to the multiple production of simple objects such as plaquettes and bells. In the 19th century, however, a more sophisticated technique was developed for the serial production of sculptural bronzes. Some artists rebelled against this, favouring instead the traditional method of lost-wax casting. This plaquette was sand cast. The grainly surface on the back is probably due to the impression of the sand from the mould. In contrast, the front has been worked until it is smooth.",
