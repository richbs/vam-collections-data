Full Citation:\n\n\"<b>111 Mr Bryan Rogers</b>\n<b>1673</b> \nEvans 30 \n\n<b>Oval 56.5 x 47mm</b> \n\nFeatures in brown and sanguine with grey diagonal hatching over a pale carnation ground; hair in brown wash, hatched with darker colour and with the lights in pale gouache, also over the carnation; cravat in pale brown wash, modelled in thick white and shadowed in grey; robe in pale brown wash, modelled with darker brown and pale pinkish-grey; background a dense brown wash; on vellum put down on pasteboard. \n\n<b>Condition:</b> Minor abrasions; otherwise very good. \n\n<b>Signed:</b> Not signed. Inscribed in gold, lower left: 1673; and in ink on the back: <i>M:r / Bryan Rogers/ June ye 5 :th / 1673</i>. \n\n<b>Frame:</b> Nineteenth-century copper-gilt rim of V-section holding a convex glass in a rebate; the back closed by a toothed copper strip. \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> Reginald Pole, sold as part of 'a fine set of family miniatures', Sotheby's 1 May 1930, lot 127, repro. ('probably by Nicholas Dixon'): bought by the Hon. F HA Wallop and lent to the Museum 12 June 1930-2 November 1949; given to Alan Evans, 1933, and by him bequeathed to the National Gallery, 1974; placed on indeterminate loan at the V&A. (See Appendix 3.) \n\n<b>Exhibited:</b> Grosvenor Place 1932 (as by Dixon). \n\n<b>Literature:</b> <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 24; Murdoch and Murrell 1981, p. 288, figs 15, 16. \n\nThe attribution to Dixon was probably first made by Sotheby's, and it was not rejected by Long when the miniature was lent to the Museum. He compared it to the Sir Thomas Thynne (Evans 32, on loan to the NPG) which was then firmly attributed to Dixon.  Reynolds on the other hand doubted whether the Thynne was by Dixon, and noted for Bryan Rogers: 'I do not see the hand of Dixon in this.' (1) The present attribution is based on the presence of all the technical markers for Gibson. The handwriting on the back, allowing for fifteen years' difference of date, is reasonably consistent with that on the Sir Richard Anderson (formerly Captain Pearce) and more particularly with that on the Lady Isabella Dormer of 1671 (Cat. No. 109). (2) \n\nBryan Rogers seems to have been the second husband of Margery Keigwin, daughter and co-heiress of Nicholas Godolphin of Trewarveneth in Cornwall. Her first husband, whom she married in February 1635/6, was Richard Keigwin (b.1605), a merchant of Penzance, and scion of the family of Keigwin of Mousehole, members of which were distinguished royalists. (3) On the face of it, Richard Gibson painting Mr Rogers in 1673 is evidence that the commissioning of miniatures had spread well beyond the metropolitan professional and Court class by this date. \n\n1 MS note, 20 August 1949, Wallop Loan Book, p. 166. \n2 The issue of the handwriting is discussed at greater length in Murdoch and Murrell 1981, p. 288, figs 2, 3,13-16. \n3 Burke 1833-8, vol.
