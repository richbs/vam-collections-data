            "public_access_description": "This chair makes innovative use of industrial glass and metal fittings. The metal fittings are of a type more commonly used in shop fitting. In the late 1920s Denham Maclaren worked for the interior decorator Arundell Clarke. He undertook display and exhibition work for them. This experience may have led him to experiment with glass as a material for furniture. Maclaren's chair was not only fashionable in its use of glass, but also in the choice of zebra skin upholstery. Many designers used animal skins of all kinds between the First and Second World Wars. The use of zebra added an exotic, even Surrealist, touch.",

ISBN 085667463X.\nBaker, Malcolm and Richardson, Brenda, eds. <u>A Grand Design : The Art of the Victoria and Albert Museum.</u> London: V&A Publications, 1997. 431 p., ill. ISBN 1851773088.\nAlthough contemporary British textiles and ceramics were purchased by the Museum during the 1930s, many of the most significant examples of British modernism, including this inventive, exotic chair of glass and zebra skin, were acquired only in the late 1970s in connection with the \"Thirties\" exhibition, a joint venture of the V&A and the Arts Council of Great Britain.\nWhile Denham Maclaren designed only a relatively small quantity of furniture from the late 1920s to the end of the 1930s, he of all British designers best captured the spirit of contemporary European modernism. He followed the functionalist precepts of Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, and most of his furniture was constructed of steel and glass. Reflecting the glamour of Hollywood of the period, this chair, like many of Eileen Gray's contemporaneous designs, tempers the austerity of modernism with sophisticated wit. Maclaren maintained his own London showroom from 1930 to 1936, and retailed his designs through Duncan Miller's West End showroom from 1936; he designed radios prior to the outbreak of war in 1939, although none were put into production. After 1945 his interests moved away from furniture design. This classic chair was purchased by the Museum directly from Maclaren in 1979.\n\nLit.
