The lid is moulded in the form of a feline mask.  Two wick-holders project from the front of the well. These cut through the middle of the bowl, the underside is on a level with the flat base.  The wick-holders have straight, parallel sides, the upper side horizontal, the underside slanting slightly and then more sharply up to the lotus bud-shaped opening.    A lateral flange in the form of a tri-lobed arch projects from either side of the well.  At the rear is a ring handle surmounted by a thumb-rest which rises at a 45' angle.  \n\nBelow, three chamfered legs descend at a slant then break at an angle into quarter circles resting on hexagonal feet. Engraved decoration consisting of  foliated scrolls is confined to the two trefoil flanges, a band that encircles the well mouth and the plates that partially cover the spouts. The upperside of the thumb rest  has an engraved design of addorsed birds looking back to peck at an inverted lotus bud.\n\nPatina: Uniform, mat blackish brown",
