            "public_access_description": "The ballet L'Oiseau de Feu or The Firebird composed by Igor Stravinsky was presented in London for the first time on 18 June 1912 by Serge Diaghilev's company Les Ballets Russes. Tamara Karsavina dance the title role of the firebird, with Adolph Bolm as her captor, Ivan Tsarevich, and Enrico Cecchetti as the wizard Kostche\u00ef. This illustration shows Ivan outside the castle gates when Kostche\u00ef tries to turn Ivan to stone but he steals the egg containing Kostche\u00ef's soul. The Tsarevna and the Magic Twelve Maidens look on outside the castle gates.\n\nThis illustration was published in the British magazine The Sphere in July 1912. Its artist, Fortunino Matania was the son of an Italian artist who studied at his father\u2019s studio and designed his first advertisement at the age of 9. He worked in Italy for the periodical L'Illustrazione Italiania between 1895 and 1902, and in Paris for Illustration Francaise from 1902.  He was invited to London to cover the Coronation of Edward VII for The Graphic in 1902, joined the staff of The Sphere in 1904 and became one of its star illustrators. He was especially well known during the Great War for his realistic wartime illustrations.",
