It is the stylized form of a male figure painted in red; yellow; purple; turquoise; black; green and pink to show the head; body and hands of\na man holding a bowl and large spoon. The figure wears a cap; has curly blond hair and is turning its head to the left. The shirt is decorated with dots and flowers. The legs and feet are represented by plain areas of purple and red. \n*Underneath is a fragment of printed paper; this is the original label applied when the toy was given to the co-operative. It has been partly destroyed and parts (including the date) are missing. This toy was made to traditional designs and it would have been sold to the Co-operative group for sale. Although the area co-operatives have been replaced there is still no credit given to an actual maker.\nVanka is a figure which can be seen in many different materials. It is a toy representing a traditional folk character called IVAN; a centuries old figure who always wins but is regarded as simple but resourceful. Vanka is a corruption of the name IVAN; similar to Bobbie and Robert.",
