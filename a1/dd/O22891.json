On both vessel and cover are painted floral sprays and leaves on swirling stems in underglaze blue. Fragance would have come out from the pierced holes on the cover as well as the bud-shaped knop. There are two marks inside the tall foot, one reading 'Qianlong nian zhi' (made in the Qianlong reign), the other, reading 'Jin Dingsheng zao' (made by Jin Dingsheng), is written horizontally near the footring.\n\nBlack deposits on the interior of the incense burner are evidence that the piece had been used. The vessel is a faithful copy of a 15th-century prototype, and its quality is as fine as that of imperial ware.  However the marks make it clear that the piece was not made for the use of the Qianlong Emperor.  Not only is the reign mark different from the standard imperial marks, the name Jin Dingsheng would not have been inscribed on an object for court use.\n\nQing dynasty, Qianlong period (1736-1795)",

The fragrant scent would have emerged from the pierced holes on the cover as well as the bud-shaped knop. Black deposits in the interior are evidence that the piece had been used. \n\nThe vessel is a faithful copy of a 15th-century prototype, and its quality is as fine as that of imperial ware. The mark on the base, however, indicates that the object was specially commissioned by a private individual, whose identity is unknown.",
