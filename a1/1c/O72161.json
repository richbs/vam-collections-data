Born in Bradford, Yorkshire, in 1937, he began printmaking because he had no money, and sold his first prints to the Museum of Modern Art, New York, while still a student. The following year the Royal College of Art in London withheld his diploma for failing to satisfy the requirements of the General Studies Department. He retaliated by producing his own parody of this requisite. In it he frames the College Rector, Robin Darwin, with two faces, upheld by the tutor of the General Studies Department, who in turn is being pursued by the monstrous maw of the Registrar, John Moon. Bent under the weight of these bureaucrats are the students, seen below the frame at the bottom of the picture. Hockney did subsequently receive his diploma, as well as the gold medal for painting that year.",
