They were the official mascots of the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympic Games, chosen to represent Canadian hospitality. Their names and colourful outfits were meant to be typical of Western Canadian culture.\n\nThe first official Olympic mascot was a Dachshund called Waldi who appeared at Munich in 1972, but Hidy and Howdy marked the first attempt to have both male and female versions, designed to appeal to children. Travelling in their personal motor home, a rota of 140 high school students performed as the mascots for public appearances, and the pair appeared on a wide range of merchandise including lapel pins, embroidered banners and as the plush toys seen here. \nThe appearance and use of Hidy and Howdy was carefully managed by the Calgary Organising Committee and the Community Relations Department, who licensed the production of plush bears to Hasbro Canada Inc.",
