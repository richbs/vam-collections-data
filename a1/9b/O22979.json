The series employed talented and innovative designers already established in the field of textiles, such as Groag and Lucienne Day. The series itself proved to be important and influential, establishing the terms 'modern' and 'contemporary' as selling points.\n\nThis, as its title tells us, is a nursery wallpaper. The design consists of child-like line drawings, red on a plain ground, of simple almost hieroglyphic motifs - sun, flower, house, balloon, fish, ball, tree and so on. At first sight it appears naive, but it is actually rather sophisticated, being inspired, like many 1950s patterns, by the line drawings of the artist Paul Klee. This paper was definitely for the middle-class nursery, being too specialised, too expensive and not sufficiently colourful to appeal to popular taste.",

The series employed talented and innovative designers already established in the field of textiles, such as Groag and Lucienne Day. The series itself proved to be important and influential, establishing the terms 'modern' and 'contemporary' as selling points.\n\nThis, as its title tells us, is a nursery wallpaper. The design consists of child-like line drawings, red on a plain ground, of simple almost hieroglyphic motifs - sun, flower, house, balloon, fish, ball, tree and so on. Seemingly naive, it is actually rather sophisticated, being derived, like many 1950s patterns, from the line drawings of Paul Klee. This paper was definitely for the middle-class nursery, being too specialised, too expensive and too dull in colour to appeal to popular taste.\n\n[Gill Saunders, 'British Design at Home', p.138]",
