The play by Brandon Thomas was first produced in England in February 1892 at the Theatre Royal Bury St Edmunds by the actor W.S. Penley (1851-1912) with Penley starring as Lord Fancourt Babberley, the luncheon guest who finds himself obliged to impersonate Charley's aunt from Brazil, 'where the nuts come from'.  It was produced in London at the Royalty Theatre that December, transferring to the Globe Theatre in 1893.  It was a huge success, achieving the record-breaking run of its day of 1466 performances, and making Penley's name as a star.  It opened on Broadway in October 1893 where it ran for four years.\n\nSeveral different souvenirs were produced in England and the United States as mementos of the play in general, and W.S. Penley as Charley's Aunt in particular, including ceramic and metal statuettes of Penley, pill and trinket boxes embossed with images of him, and this cat statuette which related to the play's advertising slogan: 'Enough to make a cat laugh'.",
