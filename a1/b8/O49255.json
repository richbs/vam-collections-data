It was designed by Robert Mackintosh, and made by the star New York costumier Barbara Matera; in design, cut and colour, it is a bold outfit, designed to register over the large spaces of the theatre and announce the presence of a star.  It marries into the vogue for orange which characterises the late 1960s and 1970s. \nAt that time, few Hollywood stars of Ginger Rogers's stature had appeared on the London stage and producers Bernard Delfont and Harold Fielding ensured that the 57-year-old was treated like a star from the moment she stepped off the boat at Southampton, wearing a coat with fur-trimmed hood and thigh-length boots.  A regimental band band played songs from the show as dockers cavorted for the hundreds of photographers and reporters.  She then boarded the Ginger Rogers Mame Express to Waterloo Station where similar ballyhoo awaited her before an open horse-drawn landau took her to the Savoy Hotel.  At Drury Lane, the star dressing roomwas redecorated in pink silks and satins.  It was a hugely expensive publicity exercise by producers , but as her salary was \u00a3250,000 for a year's run, they needed all the publicity they could get.",
