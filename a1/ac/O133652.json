            "bibliography": "Parkinson, R., Victoria and Albert Museum, <u>Catalogue of British Oil Paintings 1820-1860</u>, London: HMSO, 1990, p. 92\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\"FINCH, Francis Oliver (1802-1862)\n\nBorn London 22 November 1802, son of a city merchant. Studied with watercolourist John Varley 1814-19, then toured Scotland, returning to study at Sass's art school. Exhibited 14 landscapes at the RA between 1817 and 1832, but was principally a watercolourist, exhibiting 286 works at the OWS, becoming Associate 1822, Member 1827. Visited Paris 1852. Also painted portraits and miniatures, and was a singer and poet, publishing a volume of sonnets and a long poem, <i>An Artist's Dream</i>, 1863. Died London 27 August 1862. There are 17 watercolours in the V&A collections. The <i>Art Journal</i> obituarist admired the 'quiet delicacy of execution and classic, poetical feeling'; the <i>Athenaeum</i> thought 'with him the old school of painting may be said to die'. \n\nLIT: <i>Athenaeum</i> 6 September 1862, p315 (obit); <i>Art Journal</i>1862, p207; Mrs E Finch <i>Memorials of the late Francis Oliver Finch. . . with selections from his writings</i> 1865 (with engr portrait by A Roffe, after a photograph by T M Richardson): T S R Boase <i>English Art 1800-1870</i>,1959; <i>DNB</i>; J Maas <i>Victorian Painters</i> 1969; M Hardie <i>Watercolour Painting in \nBritain, II The Romantic Period</i> 1967, pp 171-2 \n\n<b>Landscape Composition</b> \n442-1888 Neg FF412 \nMillboard, 20.9 x 30.5 cm (8\u00bc x 12 ins) \nPurchased 1888 \n\nThe scene, with figures walking by a lake or river in what seems to be the ornamental garden of a classical mansion, was a favourite subject of the artist; a similar view is seen in the watercolour 'The Twilight Walk' also in the V&A collections (FA646). The ltalianate, Claudian composition is in the style of artists such as George Barret, with whom Finch was compared; according to the <i>Memorials</i> (p91), Finch most admired Claude, and copied a painting by him in the Louvre. The most Romantic mood may be compared with that of certain works by Francis Danby and his circle, and it is also worth remembering that Finch wrote poetry. Finch's master, John Varley, also worked on occasion in this 'poetic' style, for example the 'Illustration to Byron's \"Bride of Abydos\" 'in the V&A collections (1515-1882). Finch's early patron was Lord Northwick, for whom he worked on views of his house and grounds. Northwick Park, and his other property at Thirlstane Place, may have been an inspiration for paintings such as the present work (compare for example Anne Rushout's <i>Picturesque Views</i> of Northwick Park published in 1815).\"",
