Also depicted is a man's face, perhaps intended to be a 'wild-man' emerging from the woods. The iconography is probably the same as that of its companion piece, A.34-1936. The relatively simple carving of the capital, and of A.34-1936, suggests that it was made for a provincial, parish church. \n\nSee P.
