In this one Roubiliac has left both the architectural elements and surfaces roughly finished, suggesting he was working out the composition of the whole. The individual figures appear to have been modelled separately. It was made in ca. 1750.\n\nLouis Fran\u00e7ois Roubiliac (1702-1762) was one of the leading sculptors of his generation, and his busts and monuments are among the most important produced in Britain in the first half of the 18th century. He was born in Lyons, and probably trained in Dresden. He was later in Paris, but from 1730 he was based in London, apart from a brief visit to Rome in 1752.",
