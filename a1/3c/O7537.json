            "public_access_description": "Dating from the 14th century, this stained-glass panel is typical of its period. Heraldry and other quasi-military motifs constituted an increasingly important element in English monumental art. Such imagery was used, in particular, to decorate the windows, shutters and window-splays of domestic apartments and chapels at the Plantagenet court. This panel is emblazoned with three lions and has a border argent. It probably depicts the coat of arms of Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent and 3rd Baron Holand (1350-97). He was created Earl of Kent by King Richard II in 1381.\nCommissioning stained glass schemes was a highly effective means of portraying and promoting notions of an individual's identity and community. At a time when the English monarchy was becoming increasingly concerned with its public image, the presentation of its arms alongside those of other nobles gave powerful visual expression to their political alliances, blood ties and lineage, both real and aspirational.\nThis panel was possibly acquired from Strawberry Hill (Twickenham, Middlesex), home of Horace Walpole (1717-1797). Walpole, who pioneered England's 18th-century Gothic revival, transformed the property into a pseudo-Gothic 'castle' in which to hoard his celebrated collection of antiquities, prints and curiosities. His particular interest in heraldry was reflected in the Medieval stained glass with which he decorated his residence.",

His arms appear to have always been the newly created arms of England (quartered with France) with label argent.\n\nThe arms of Edmund of Woodstock, the youngest son (by second marriage) of Edward I, were the arms of England (gules 3 lions passant guardant or) differenced by a bordure argent. This Edmund was the first Earl of Kent; he was born in 1301 at Woodstock Palace, Oxon, and executed for treason in 1330, by order of his nephew, Edward III. He was succeeded by his son, Edmund, as 2nd Earl of Kent who died in 1331. His youngest son, John, then became the 3rd Earl of Kent until his death in 1352. His heir was his sister Joan who became 4th Countess Kent. She married, first, Thomas Holland who succeeded to the Earldom of Kent, and, second, the Prince of Wales (the Black Prince).\n\nJoan had made a secret marriage at the age of 12 to Thomas Holland (azure semi de lys argent a lion rampant argent). This Thomas Holland was one of the founder members of the Order of the Garter and was one of the principal captains on the Calais Campaign (1346/7). Summoned to Parliament between 1353 and 1356 as Baron de Holland. Became Earl of Kent in 1352 upon the death of his brother-in-law, John. He died in 1360 and was succeeded as 2nd Earl of Kent by his son by Joan, Thomas (but not until 1381). \nThis Thomas bore the arms: gules 3 lions rampant or a bordure argent. He became a knight of the Garter in 1375. \nJoan and Thomas' son John, 1st Duke of Exeter, bore the arms: gules 3 lions passant guardant or a bordure semi de lys.\n\nIt seems likely that the arms, gules 3 lions passant guardant or a bordure argent, were first born by Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent (1301-1330) and were then born by his descendents, passing to the Holland family at the death of John, 3rd Earl, in 1352. \n\nThomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester (1355-1397) was the 13th child of Edward III and Queen Philippa. Was born at Woodstock Palace in Oxfordshire. His arms were those of the newly created arms of England (quartered with France) and a bordure Argent.\n\nThe so-called Calais Arms (early 17th century) states that Sir Edmund of Woodstock, Lord of Kent (arms of England bordure argent) was one of the leaders of the Calais Campaign (1346/7). This is not possible and, instead, must be referencing his son, John, 3rd Earl of Kent.",
