The demand for 'antique' vases was so great that, in addition to copying surviving Classical antiquities, manufacturers copied designs from prints of the 17th and 18th centuries. Some of these prints were highly fanciful inventions, which were not seriously intended to be models for production. Wedgwood adapted the design here from a vase print by Friedrich Kirschner (1748-1789), a German miniature painter.\n\nMaterials &amp; Making\nThe vase is made of Black Basalt, one of several types of pottery that Josiah Wedgwood (1730-1795) introduced or refined. The black colour came from 'Carr', an oxide of iron suspended in water that had flowed through coal seams and mines.",
