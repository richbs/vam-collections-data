They were simple wooden marionette puppets painted in bright colours and usually wore brightly coloured felt clothes.  Many of the puppets produced by Pelham were characters from well known children's stories like Hansel and Gretel, and Little Red Riding Hood.  Bob Pelham had always been interested in the way string toys moved. He had originally started up a company called Wonkey Toys making Wakouwa's.  A Wakouwa is a wooden toy, usually in an upright position, held together by string. It stands on a base which when pressed collapses the toy and when released returns the toy to its original position.  Pelham puppets are still very popular today in a strong collectors' market.",
