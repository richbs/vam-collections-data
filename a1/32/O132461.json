He was a collaborator of Canaletto when he was in his 40s and became later very popular running a large studio of his own. He trained both his younger brother Nicol\u00f2 and his son Giacomo, whose work is well known and who imitated his father's style.  \n\nThis painting is a characteristic example of Francesco Guardi's 'capriccio' paintings, a genre that became popular in Venice. It shows an imaginary landscape with Roman ruins and small figures involved in a daily activity. The pictorial rendering of light is particularly elaborate and witnessed the mastery of Venetian painters in that field.",

Before 1800,</u> London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, p. 140, cat. no. 161.\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\nFrancesco GUARD I (1712-93) \nItalian (Venetian) School \nThe son of an Austrian painter, Domenico Guardi (1678-1716), he was born in Venice, where he lived his whole life. He appears to have shared the studio of his elder brother Gian Antonio (1698-1760) in the period before 1760. Gian Antonio was a painter of figure subjects whereas Francesco practised mainly view painting, but the exact division between the two brothers is controversial. Francesco was influenced by Magnasco, Marco Ricci and Carlevarijs, as well as by Canaletto, whose pupil he may have been and whose compositions he copied in his early years (see below nos. 163-65). He was elected to the Venetian Academy in 1784 and died in 1793. His sister married G. B. Tiepolo. \nLit. G. Simonson, <i>Francesco Guard</i>i, 1904; G. Fiocco, <i>Francesco Guardi</i>, 1923; <i>Mostra dei Guardi</i> (<i>Catalogo</i> a cura di P. Zampetti), Venice, Palazzo Grassi, 1965.\n\n\n161 \nCAPRICCIO WITH RUINS AND FIGURES \nCanvas \n36 \u00bd x 28 \u00bd (92.7 x 72.5) \nJones Bequest \n489-1882 \n\n489-1882 is a companion to 490-1882 (no. 162). They belong to a group of Capricci which Guardi painted in the second half of his career. The motif of the arch in 490-1882 appears in a smaller picture in the N. G. (no. 2522: <i>18th century Italian Schools. Plates, 1957, pl. 37</i>) and with minor variations in a painting formerly in the Manfroni Collection, Trento (R. Pallucchini, <i>La pittura veneziana del settecento</i>, 1960, fig. 649). The latter is securely dated 1778, when Guardi visited Trento (not in 1782 as was formerly believed; see F. De Maffei, <i>Gian Antonio Guardi</i>, 1951, p. 42). Another closely comparable composition (formerly Chiesa Collection, Milan; Goering, 1944, fig. 129) was also painted during Guardi's stay in Trento. The N. G. picture has been dated c. 1775-80 and 489190-1882 may be placed in the same period. \n\nProv. Wynn Ellis Collection; John Jones; bequeathed to the Museum in 1882. \nLit. G. A.

Victoria & Albert Museum, HMSO, London, 1990. p.xix-xx\n\nJohn Jones (1800-1882) was first in business as a tailor and army clothier in London 1825, and opened a branch in Dublin 1840.  Often visited Ireland, travelled to Europe and particularly France.  He retired in 1850, but retained an interest in his firm.  Lived quietly at 95 Piccadilly from 1865 to his death in January 1882.  After the Marquess of Hertford and his son Sir Richard Wallace, Jones was the principal collector in Britain of French 18th century fine and decorative arts.  Jones bequeathed an important collection of French 18th century furniture and porcelain to the V&A, and among the British watercolours and oil paintings he bequeathed to the V&A are subjects which reflect his interest in France.  \n\nSee also <u>South Kensington Museum Art Handbooks.  The Jones Collection.  With Portrait and Woodcuts</u>.  Published for the Committee of Council on Education by Chapman and Hall, Limited, 11, Henrietta Street. 1884.  \n<u>Chapter I. Mr. John Jones</u>.  pp.1-7.\n<u>Chapter II. No.95, Piccadilly</u>.  pp.8-44.  This gives a room-by-room guide to the contents of John Jones' house at No.95, Piccadilly.\n<u>Chapter VI. ..... Pictures,... and other things</u>, p.138, \"The pictures which are included in the Jones bequest are, with scarcely a single exception, valuable and good; and many of them excellent works of the artists.  Mr. Jones was well pleased if he could collect enough pictures to ornament the walls of his rooms, and which would do no discredit to the extraordinary furniture and other things with which his house was filled.\"\n\nHistorical significance: The present painting appears to be a characteristic example of Francesco Guardi's production of 'capriccio' pieces and forms a pendant with 490-1882. It shows an imaginary landscape with Roman ruins and arches through which one can distinguish the seashore, a boat and little figures in the background. The ruins are partially covered with branches and foliage while two small figures dressed as peasants are carrying baskets in the background. The colour scheme, dominated by a silvery green tonality, provides the picture with diffused brightness enhanced by the play of light and shade projected against the ruins. A wide atmospheric sky reveals the taste of Venetian painters for the pictorial rendering of light. \nThe 'capriccio', a somewhat derivation of the 'veduta', i.e. a landscape or town view that is largely topographical in conception, enabled the painter to develop further his imagination as he included in a realistic setting fantastic elements and had therefore to combine them together in an elaborate composition. A characteristic of Guardi's artistic practice was to use again and again identical motifs in different works. In this painting, Guardi focused on the ruined arch that he employed in several other versions over the decades (see for instance <i>A Caprice with Ruins on the Seashore</i>, The National Gallery, London, dated 1775-80). \nAccording to A. Morassi (1973), this work is one of the most elaborated 'capriccio' executed by Francesco Guardi to be dated between the 1760 and 1770 when he developed a much freer brushwork, an essential characteristic of his mature period. This 'capriccio' witnesses Francesco Guardi's personal interpretation of the art of such past great masters as Marco Ricci, whose style particularly influenced Guardi, and to some extent of Canaletto, both exerting a great impact on the development of the 18th-century Venetian art.",

            "historical_context_note": "A 'capriccio' is a painted, drawn or engraved composition that combines imaginary and realistic architectural features in a picturesque setting, often dotted with small figures, and mostly displayed as wall schemes for interior decoration. It emerges as a genre during the early 18th-century Rococo period, and became extremely popular during the era of the Grand Tour of Europe, stimulated by the need of recording topographical settings. The Italian landscape, which abounded with classical ruins, was especially favoured for this new genre painting. It particularly developed in Venice with such artists as Marco Ricci (1676-1730) and his uncle Sebastiano Ricci (1659-1734), together with Canaletto (1697-1768), Giambattista Pittoni (1687-1767) and Giovanni Battista Piazzetta (1682-1754), and in Rome where Giovanni Paolo Panini (ca. 1692-1765) was the most representative of the 'capriccio' painters. The genre declined during the early part of the next century, gradually transformed and was eventually absorbed by the Romanticism.",
