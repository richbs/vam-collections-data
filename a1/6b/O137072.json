At the rear of the blade \"cut-card\" work spills from the handle like fronds of seaweed. The irregular dips and rolls of the free trowel-shaped blade mirror the ebb and flow of a tide. The fretted patterns on the blade echo the curves of the cut-out, receding back like a dying wave. The upright handle, erect and strong takes the shape of a porpoise tail, its asymmetry complementing the irregularity of the blade and capturing the essence of marine life. The bright pitted surface of the handle, created by a high-speed stone wheel, adds a tactile element to the server enhancing the sense of vitality.  The underside of this server is acid-etched with marine motifs giving subtle detail to this simple piece. Rococo principles are in evidence here applied with the freedom of form that is typical of many American designs.",
