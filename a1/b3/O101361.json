In the centre, at '2', at the top are what look like a  magnified view of part of a flea and drawings of individual parts. To the right, at '3', could be a diagrammatic representation of an astronomical constellation, a tadpole and a section of  a plant.

The technique of Chine coll\u00e9 in which a very fine paper bearing the printed image is pasted to a stronger one is used here, with the Japanese Ganpi paper (made from a tree of that name) adhered to Arches, a stronger, French paper. Imai caught the fish portrayed here at the coast of his hometown and tells us it was 88cm long. He ate it with his family after making a number of drawings. The images around the fish may derive from old Japanese fishing manuals.  \n\nImai's best known works are the Sushi-Maru series which focuses on fish caught in Japanese seas.  He often depicts the fish used in sushi and the timing of his work is governed by the fishing seasons. He  likes to think of making an etching as a process akin to cooking, in which adjustments of heat and seasoning can be compared to the judgement of immersion times of the plate in acid, the depth of line cut and the application of ink.",
