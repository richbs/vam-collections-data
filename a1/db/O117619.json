Born into a Jewish family in Frankfurt, she initially pursued an academic career before moving to Paris in 1930 to concentrate on photography.\n\nIn the early 1930s Bing had been a prolific photographer, well-known for her modernist, journalistic city scenes. This photograph was taken during a period when Bing made few photographs and felt that she had \u2018said what I had to say\u2019. It demonstrates her skill in photographing still-life, an unusual subject for her. The sharp angles, steep perspective and focus on light and shade, typical of her images of buildings, add to the beauty of this delicate image.",
