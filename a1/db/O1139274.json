In 1942 she wrote what became her signature song I'm Going to See You Today. During the war she toured India, North Africa and the Middle East with a company performing for the British troops. She became a writer at the BBC and later a television panelist. She is perhaps best remembered for her one-woman shows and monologues, including that in which she played the harassed nursery teacher saying the now famous line: 'George - don't do that.'\n\nThe artist Stacey Hopper was born in South Wales and taught art before the war at Ealing. In 1934 he published the caricature The Origin of the Nazi Salute which credited the salute as a tribute to an image of Hitler holding up n a paintbrush. During the war, whilst serving in the Royal Corps of Signals, Hopper's artistic talent led to his providing artwork for the Army Medical Department, notably to warn soldiers of the dangers of malarial mosquitoes. He returned to teaching after the war and continued producing caricatures for publication, especially of actors and entertainers.",
