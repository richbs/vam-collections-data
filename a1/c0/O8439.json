This panel, the second of six relating the legend of St George and the Dragon, depicts 'How the damsels of the court cast lots who should be the Dragon's meat and how the lot fell to the King's daughter'. The series was believed to have been made to decorate windows at Harden Hall in Bingley, West Yorkshire. Morris & Co. soon built up an extensive repertoire of designs which could be reproduced or adapted for new commissions. At least one other version of the series is know to survive in a house in Cragside, Northumberland.\n\nPeople\nThis series was designed by Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1828-1882). Following his preoccupations with the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, he came into contact with William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones in 1856. They shared an enthusiasm for the legendary past and expressed it in narrative cycles such as this.  Rosetti produced considerably fewer cartoons for stained-glass windows than others in the group, and his interest in the medium died out after a few years.\n\nMaterials & Making\nMorris & Co. lacked the technical expertise to make the glass for their designs, but bought it from the London glassmakers James Powell & Sons. A wide range of high quality 'pot metal' (coloured glass) is used in this panel. The olive greens and rich, dark reds, juxtaposed with dazzling areas of gold and white, are characteristic of the innovative palette used throughout the series.",
