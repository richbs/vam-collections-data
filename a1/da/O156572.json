The document awarding Admiral Earl Howe the freedom of the City of London was presented in a gold box in 1794. The honour was to commemorate his blockade of French grain ships when Britain was at war with France after the French Revolution.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver,  mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
