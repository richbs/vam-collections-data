Rupert would often assist Millais by photographing backgrounds for paintings and sitters for portraits. Beatrix Potter recounted one particularly memorable sitting in July 1884 when her father photographed the former prime minister, William Ewart Gladstone (1809-1898), for Millais' second portrait of him, completed in 1885: ' Papa has been photographing old Gladstone this morning at Mr. Millais'\u2026  They kept off politics of course, and talked about photography.  Mr. Gladstone talked of it on a large scale, but not technically.  What would it come to, how far would the art be carried, did papa think people would ever be able to photograph in colours?' (Journal, Monday 28th July 1884).\n\nMary Millais (1860-1944) and Caroline Millais (Mary is pictured here holding a tennis racket and Caroline is seated on the doorstep on the right) were the daughters of Euphemia ('Effie') Chalmers Gray (1828-1897) and Sir John Everett Millais (1829-1896).  Euphemia had previously married the art critic, author, poet and artist John Ruskin (1819-1900) in 1846.  Shortly after their marriage, however, Ruskin introduced her to his friend and proteg\u00e9e, Millais, and while she modelled for Millais' painting, The Order of Release (1853), she fell in love with him.  Ruskin had been unwilling to consummate his marriage to Euphemia and, despite having been married for several years, she was still a virgin. In 1854, therefore, Euphemia annulled her marriage to Ruskin and married Millais the following year.  They had eight children, including John Guille Millais, a naturalist and wildlife artist.  \n\nThe Millais family lived mostly in London but spent long summer holidays at Annet Lodge near Bowerswell, Perthshire.  Here, Millais executed many of his best-known paintings and enjoyed the company of likeminded friends, including the Potters who also spent extended summers in Perthshire, first at Dalguise, then later at Eastwood, a large house on the bank of the Tay in Dunkeld.  Rupert photographed several pleasant summer afternoons in the company of the Millais family; another version of this photograph is held in the V&A's Linder Bequest.",
