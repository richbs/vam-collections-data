He was a pupil of Adolf Stademann (1824-1895) and Adolf Heinrich Lier (1826-1882) in Munich. He travelled extensively in Germany, England, Italy and Holland, exhibited in Vienna and Munich between 1873 and 1883, and in the Royal Academy in London between 1880 and 1881. \n\nHeffner was one of the greatest exponents of the Munich School of Paintings led by A. Stademan who was his master. This painting depicts a winter scene on the Isar river in Munich, with small figures in the foreground. Following the Realist technique, this work was probably executed directly after the motif in open air. This work is a fine example of Heffner's early manner.",

The refined and almost monochrome brushwork is characteristic of his first manner before it evolves towards a broader technique inherited from the English models of such painters as Turner and Constable but also the French Realist Corot and Rousseau. \nThe palette is dominated by monochrome hues of yellowish brown and is a good example of the Realist movement that developed in the Germanic countries in the second half of the 19th century under the influence of French realism and the Barbizon school. \nThis work was probably executed in open air, following the tradition of Realist paintings and later reworked in studio while the monochrome overall aspects provides the picture with an interesting photographic quality. \nThis work may have been painted directly for the English market as Heffner regularly supplied pictures to the English art dealer Thomas Wallis, whose business activities brought to Munich. Such pictures attracted patrons and collectors and hitherto a great extent of Heffner's oeuvre is to be found in private collections rather in public institutions.",
