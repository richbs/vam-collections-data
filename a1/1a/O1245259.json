This marionette was one of twenty marionettes used by Peter and Frances Grant for their production of Pinocchio, adapted by them from Carlo Collodi's children's story The Adventures of Pinocchio for their touring company The Theatre of Marionettes. The Clown was also used in Gepetto's Workshop on Tour and Victorian Entertainments as an example of a 'Fantocchini' or trick puppet. The Clown can be manipulated to do the splits, bend over backwards and stand or walk on his hands.\n\nThe Grants started their company in the 1960s and worked with it all over Britain and Europe.\n\nThe bodies of the marionettes were sculpted by Frances Grant from obeche, a tropical type of wood well-known for its lack of splinters or resin, while the  faces, hands and feet were sculpted by her using epoxy resin. Peter Grant dressed all the figures, using a wide range of fabrics and techniques for their costumes and their props.",
