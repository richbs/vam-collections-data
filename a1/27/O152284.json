Faced with plain weave cotton and backed with plain weave cotton.\nThe cover has been assembled from fabric probably used in a garment - the embroidered has been cut through and there are marked creases along the top end from old seams.\nthere is one group of elongated leaves which subtly overlap to form parallel undulating lines.  The leaves are narrow and pointed at both ends, some contain chevrons and some are divided along their length and are worked in 2 colours: red and yellow, light green and green, grey and metal thread, dark green and metal thread, apricot and metal thread and sometimes apricot alone.  There are small 3-petalled flowers in white or apricot and small pointed buds in light brown.\nThe embroidery silk seems to be unplied.\nMetal Thread: Silver strip close S-wound on very light yellow silk.\nGeneral Note: when metal thread wears it's impossible to know whether or not it was originally close wound. \nFacing: bias cut blue plain weave cotton.\nBacking: green plain weave cotton.\nThere are lines of stitching on the front: some of the regular stitching along the sides is connected to the facing; there are also two horizontal lines of irregular tacking in purple silk which go through the backing.",
