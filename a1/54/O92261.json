The perforations are not simply decorative. They ensured a flow of air to keep the charcoal embers burning.\n\nFood and drink were often prepared a long way from the room in which they were consumed. People burned charcoal in braziers to keep kettles or pans hot and to warm rooms when there was no fire. Moderate-sized braziers were generally set down on tables or tripod stands.\n \nBraziers have the longest and most widespread history of all types of heating apparatus. They could be used at any time and in any place, speedily ignited or conveniently stored away when not in use. They burned charcoal, a more convenient, economical and efficient fuel than raw timber. It was cheaper to transport, easier to store and longer lasting as less was needed to generate the same amount of heat. Smoke and fumes were eliminated in the open and only the glowing embers brought indoors.",
