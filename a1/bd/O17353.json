The architect Philip Webb, who accompanied Boyce on his visit to the barn, wrote to him fifteen years later: 'this drawing I thought to be one of your best pieces of good work, work in truth which was always good, and often quite perfect of its kind... an historic representation of what the Architects and others will soon destroy.'  In fact, this important barn is now a protected building, and is open to the public.  Boyce was a great friend of Rossetti and other Pre-Raphaelites, indeed we know a great deal about them from his diaries, and he derived from them his minute treatment of landscape and architecture and luminous colouring.  The year of this painting, 1878, was significant for Boyce as he was finally elected a Member of the Old Water Colour Society; as a gentleman of independent means, he was not considered a 'professional' painter.",
