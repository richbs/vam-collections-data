This is said to be inspired by the contrasting colours of the Ganga and Jumna the two great rivers in north India. The ornate nature of the lota indicates that it is likely to be used for religious purposes, such as carrying water to wash the temple gods.  This is a typical south Indian shape which adapts the round globular form by extending the top further than the base of the pot.",

The basic design of the lota was adapted to perform many related functions: holding, carrying, and pouring water.  The form, decoration, size and material reflect the function of the pot, the geographical area in which it was produced and the status of the people for whom it was made.  The shape itself is derived from natural forms such as the gourd and the melon. Different types of pots are used to carry water from the well for everyday use, to store water, to drink water from and for  daily ablutions. They are also used as containers for sacred water or water that is to be used for ritual purposes.",
