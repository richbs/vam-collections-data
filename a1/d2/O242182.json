From 1973-1975 he worked at the Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence at Stanford University, where he developed the computer program AARON, which became his creative authority from then on. Besides instructions on form and colour the program also takes into account what AARON has previously drawn, thus making it highly complex. Over the years AARON was further developed by the artist ('taught by the artist'), making it more and more a complex system. AARON can be seen as the first robot in human history to create art, the world's first pure A.I. (artificial intelligence) artist. The machine for example even selects and mixes colours and washes out the brushes. AARON cannot learn new techniques or imagery on its own - this must be hand-coded by Harold Cohen - but it is capable of producing a practically infinite output of distinct images in its own style.",
