The body, painted grey over white with black hooves, is made in two sections (top and bottom) with each leg joined on separately. Each back leg has a wood brace at the top and the body as a whole is gently shaped. The tail stump also appears to have been joined on separately and is surrounded with a band of leather, some studs but no hair. The head and neck are of cast iron mounted on a central panel of wood running along the upper neck. The head is screwed to each side of the body with two screws, though one of these is still covered in plaster. The head is hollow with pegs to the wood neck panel showing on the cheeks. There are no eyes but the open mouth and nostrils have some traces of red paint. One stud and a strap of leather are attached to the chest. The two rockers are of iron and each end is curled. There is a cross brace at each end between the rockers which widen out in the centre. The horse is mounted on four metal arms which are bolted onto the rockers.",
