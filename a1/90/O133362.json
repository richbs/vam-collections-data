The back fastens with oversized jewellery clasps, covered with a diagonal strip of leather.\n\nPaco Rabanne was the son of Balenciaga's head seamstress. After studying architecture, he designed jewellery and accessories for Paris couturiers such as Balenciaga and Dior. In 1966 he opened his own fashion house in Paris where he sold dresses made out of innovative or unusual materials like acrylic discs, metal links, and paper. In 1968, he designed the actress Jane Fonda's wardrobe for the film Barbarella.",
