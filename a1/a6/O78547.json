The cradle shape held the circular cheese upright as it rested on its side. Commonly made in wood, cheese plates in silver are very rare. Only four similar plates are known.\n\nPeople\nThis cheese plate was ordered by Brownlow Cecil, 9th Earl of Exeter (1725-1793), from the London goldsmiths Parker and Wakelin.  Edward Wakelin  (active from 1730, died 1784), who supplied the cheese plate, had supervised the workshop of the goldsmith George Wickes in Panton Street, London, since the 1740s. When Wickes and his partner retired, he continued the business in partnership with John Parker (active about 1730-1765). The plate may have been made in the firm's own workshop or  by an outworker under Wakelin's direction. The cheese plate cost the Earl \u00a337 7s 6d; the engraving of his coat of arms, crests and coronets was an extra 15 shillings.",
