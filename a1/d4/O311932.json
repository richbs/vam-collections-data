            "history_note": "Mr James Lycett provided the following information:\n\n\"The blank (unengraved) medal was probably supplied to the Mechanics' Institution by Joseph Mayer, Silversmith in Liverpool, in 1839, manufactured using John Ottley's dies.\nThey were supplied as part of a new campaign to encourage the citizens to contribute for a new building for the Mechanics' institution.  A Life Membership cost 10 Guineas. Earlier Life Members had received a copper token. \n\nThe order of the numbering of the silver medals is in the order of who donated the largest amount - not in order of time of donation.  Thus the funds must have been collected (between 1832 and 1839) before the silver medals were engraved and presented.\n\nMiss Durning donated \u00a3105. 0. 0. to the school building fund to earn her Silver Medal. She was probably \"Miss Jemina Durning\", younger sister of George Holt Snr. Esq's wife, Emma.  George Holt also was a Life Member of the Liverpool Mechanics' Institution, and a little later became very deeply involved with\nthe School.\n\nThe proceeds from such memberships allowed the construction of a new school building to go ahead in 1836, and it was formally opened during the 7th annual week long meeting of the British Association in Liverpool, held mainly in the new building, during September 1837.\n\nThe Liverpool Mechanics' Institution had started in 1825 as the Liverpool Mechanics' School of Arts, and took on the name of the Liverpool Mechanics' Institution in 1832 when the new building campaign began.\nOn moving into the new building in 1838, additional day schools were added and it gradually morphed into the Liverpool Institute High School.  The school was closed in 1985.  The building still remains at the top of Mount Street in Liverpool and is now occupied, since 1996, by the Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts (LIPA).\"",
