By 1874, he had taken over his father\u2019s firm, now established in nearby Nancy, and begun to revolutionise its products with new glass designs in the Art Nouveau style. In 1884 he opened a furniture-making workshop and he soon became famous for his elegant Art Nouveau pieces, of which this fire screen is typical. \n\nGall\u00e9 had studied botany as a young man and his love of plants is evident in many of the pieces he made. Here the flowing lines of the overall design and of the marquetry decoration transform what was a very traditional item of furniture. The marquetry is combined not only with high-relief carving but also with subtle low-relief carving of the fronds and leaves, which add a subtle depth to the design.",

ISBN 1851773088.\nThis firescreen, like the Majorelle cabinet (cat. 165), was one of the Art Nouveau objects purchased for the V&A by George Donaldson from the 1900 Paris Exposition Universelle. Emile Gall\u00e9 was a leading designer and manufacturer of glass (by 1900 he employed more than 300 workers at his Nancy factory) and, from 1884, furniture as well; he won prizes for both at the 1900 exhibition. Gall\u00e9 studied botany and mineralogy at university, and he passionately advocated natural ornament in furniture.\nThe firescreen's decoration of dancing leaves and swooping vines-whose tendrils snake along the screen's framework and even wrap around its legs, thus integrating structure and decoration-is archetypal Art Nouveau and quintessential Gall\u00e9.\n\nRICHARD DUNN/BRENDA RICHARDSON\nGreenhalgh, Paul Ed., <font u>Art Nouveau : 1890 - 1914</font u>.
