            "history_note": "The first 'Art of War' series was designed by Lambert de Hondt and woven by Jerome Le Clerc and Gaspar van der Borght.  This tapestry is from the second series woven by de Vos and designed by Phillipe de Hondt.  Some sets of the second series include scenes and figures borrowed from the cartoons of the 'Battles of the Duke of Marlborough'. \n\nThis tapestry was formerly at Drakelowe, and probably sold before 28 May 1937 when the other two pieces from that set were sold at Sotheby's.\n\nThe 'Art of War' tapestries belonging to Mr Finney were reputed to be the set which was made for Augustus the Strong of Saxony in 1708.  This date, given by Schmitz in <u>Bildteppiche</u> (3rd ed., p.256) is probably a mistake for 1718 as a scene taken from the 'Battle of Blenheim' in the Dresden set could not have been used until after 1717.  'The March', 'The Camp' and 'Cutting Fascines' are illustrated in Ackerman.  'The Siege' and 'The Ambush', not known to Ackerman, appear to be part of the same set, which Bernheimer stated was of eight pieces.  Of the two further pieces illustrated by Ackerman, 'The Halt' is now in the National Museum, Warsaw, and the tapestry after 'Blenheim' was on the art market in 1964.  The eighth, missing piece may have been similar to Marlborough's tapestry of 'Malplaquet' for the Dresden set was known as 'Die Schlachten bei H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt und Malplaquet'",
