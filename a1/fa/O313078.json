This cast was probably taken from the first clay sketch model which Brock was commissioned to execute by the Queen Victoria Memorial Committee in April 1901. This model was completed by the following summer when it was officially inspected by the King in June 1901.\nIn 1921 the Victoria Memorial was described by Kineton Parkes as 'Sir Thomas Brock's biggest undertaking, and the most considerable work of a monumental kind in recent London Sculpture'.\nTwo further models for the Victoria memorial outside Buckingham Palace are also in the Museum's collections (inv. nos. A.8 and 9-1977). These three bronzes were given to the Museum by Mr and Mrs Roland Morris in 1977. Mr Roland Morris's father was William Thomas Morris (1874-1944), Chairman and Managing Director of the Morris Singer Company who cast the works.",

Mr Roland Morris's father was William Thomas Morris (1874-1944), Chairman and Managing Director of the Morris Singer Company.\nThis cast was probably taken from the first clay sketch model which Brock was commissioned to execute by the Queen Victoria Memorial Committee in April 1901. This model was completed by the following summer when it was officially inspected by the King in June 1901.\n\nHistorical significance: In 1921 the Victoria Memorial was described by Kineton Parkes as 'Sir Thomas Brock's biggest undertaking, and the most considerable work of a monumental kind in recent London Sculpture'.",
