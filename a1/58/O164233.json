Changes in the design of watches made the movements redundant, but beautifully enamelled watchcases proved useful to box makers for re-use. Here the boxmaker has taken the earlier watchcase and added a lid, rims, and two enamel portraits painted by Zincke, who dominated the enamel portrait market in London from the early 18th century.  The portrait of a woman resembles a portrait of Frances, Lady Carteret by Abraham Seaman (active 1724-53).\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde amassed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
