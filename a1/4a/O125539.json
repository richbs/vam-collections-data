Tallboy, walnut (in 2 parts\"\n\n1924 letter, Browett to Rackham\noffers to bequeath furniture to the V & A.  Brackett's request to inspect the furniture at that time is not taken up.  Browett writes \"the walnut chest on stand is English and is really a piece of fine quality, the photo does not show the claw and ball feet properly; they are firm & well shaped, not skimpy\".\n\n5/6/37 letter, Browett to Rackham\noffers to present the bequeathed furniture at one.  He writes \"there are a number of pieces of walnut, marquetry and mahogany furniture which I think are of sufficient interest to be chosen.  The best of the walnut pieces is illustrated in Macquoid's Dictionary of English Furniture, Vol.2 page 63) fig. 31.\n\n9/6/37 memo, Thorpe to Edwards\nexpresses interest only in the chest illustrated in Macquoids.\n\n12/7/37 letter, Browett to Edwards\nlists the walnut tallboy among 34 gifts of furniture and many gifts of metal and ceramic.  He writes \"The collection has been gathered together on a very slender income\u2026.and represent practically the whole of my life's savings\".\n\n(There does not seem to be any report by Edwards of his July 3 1937 visit to inspect the furniture)\n\n31/8/37 letter, E Maclagan (Director) to Browett\nthanks him for the gift and writes \"It is not very long since our collection of English furniture was universally recognised as being hopelessly inadequate;\u2026..the acquisition of so many first rate examples together marks a really notable step in its improvement.  Many visitors\u2026will be\u2026..indebted to your taste and liberality\".\n\n2/10/37 letter, Edwards to Browett\nreports that a special exhibition of his gift will open in October and that he has written an illustrated article in \"Country Life\" for 9 October on Browett's gift.\n\n22/10/59 minute, Thorpe to Molesworth\nsuggests a letter to Browett who \"has excellent taste in furniture, by which the Museum might benefit further\".  Thorpe has visited Browett and seen \"the near-twin of the ivory claw tallboy\".\n\n31/10/59 letter, Browett reply to Thorpe\nexplains that his dramatically reduced circumstances prevent him from making further gifts to the V & A.",
