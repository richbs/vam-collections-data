            "public_access_description": "This chair's very clever, simple design allows it to be made from a single sheet of plywood. Designed in 1934 by Gerald Summers and manufactured by his London company, The Makers of Simple Furniture, the chair is made from a plywood sheet consisting of 13 layers of cross-grained veneer. The sheet was first cut with four straight lines, which outlined the position and width of the arms and back legs. While the glue between the plys was still wet, the sheet was then pressed in a wooden mould for eight hours. The mould articulated the curve of the chair's legs and arms, leaving only the front legs to be cut out after the moulding process was finished. \n\nThe construction of the chair from a single piece of moulded board gives it a highly distinctive visual and structural clarity. Summers was one of a group of European designers working in the early 1930s to push the formal and structural limits of new furniture materials such as plywood.",

Despite constructive advantages, the production costs of the chair and subsequently the sales price were quite high (especially higher than the then popular Scandinavian designs).\n\nHistorical significance: This chair is an example of the ideal unity of material, production and form. The simple construction dispenses with connectors and almost no off-cuts, using one single sheet of plywood. Following a simple pattern which separates the back legs from the back and armrests, the segments were bent in different directions resulting in an organically shaped armchair that is comfortable even without a cushion.",
