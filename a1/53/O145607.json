            "physical_description": "Cover, silk satin embroidered with couched metal thread and details in silk in satin stitch and laid and couched, faced with black plain weave silk and backed with green plain weave silk.\nPieced.  The border and the central field were probably part of one larger embroidery which has been cut down and re-arranged.\nFor similar pattern lay-out and colour scheme see 56-1877.\nThe border along the top and bottom consist of long red ground pieces and beige ground corner squares. There is a similar red ground stripe in the central field and one now forming the right hand side border. The pattern on these is an undulating stem with leaves, blossoms and small spiral circles.  The stems and main elements are outlined with black and white silk threads twisted together.  The left hand border and the top and bottom ones seem to have been cut from a less linear design and have curving stems and birds.  The beige ground corner square have also been cut from a larger piece and contain a large serrated leaf. There are two beige ground stripes in the central area to either side of the red one already mentioned.  The one on the left has a wide undulating stem with large serrated leaves.  The one of the right is a wide stripe with a rigid stem, central roundel overlaid with a 5-petalled flower head and terminating with a stylised pomegranate between two upward curving leaves.  There are two large birds perched across the stem.  The original embroidery probably consisted of a series of red and beige stripes and the wide beige stripe with the birds may have been in the centre.  Although the top and bottom borders have been added, there is no evidence that the vertical stripes have been tampered with.\nRed satin: red Z-twist warp and cream weft\nBeige satin: beige Z-twist warp and beige weft.\nMetal thread: [1] silver-gilt close S-wound on Z-twist light cream silk couched with light pink and sometimes red silk. [2] silver strip close S-wound on Z-twist white silk couched with white silk.\nEmbroidery silk: pink, green, black, white, dark green and blue.\nFacing: bias cut black plain weave silk\nBacking: unpatterned lime green plain weave silk",
