Both studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris and became famous for their skillful reinterpretation of 18th-century styles. \n\nThey built a large practice working for rich financiers and industrialists both in France and Britain. They remodelled Luton Hoo for the diamond magnate Julius Wernher, and one of their most celebrated commission was the Ritz Hotel (1903-6) in London, the first steel-framed building in the city designed with a Parisian exterior and mansard roof, and interiors in the Louis XVI style.",

This design for a bed in the style of the 1720s is from an album of designs for all types of bedroom furniture, including matching wardrobes, bed-side tables and chaises longues. The elaborate gilded bed-head and footboard, with hoofed feet and legs derived from chair or chest-of-drawer legs, was typical of their work. Other looks that appealed to middle-class taste at this time included less exuberant, though equally grand forms such as Neo-classical or Empire styles. Beds, wardrobes and other furniture were veneered, gilded and adorned with ormolu mounts to suit the Parisian apartments and hotels. The  designs in this album are executed in a pretty, light manner making them all the more attractive to prospective customers.\"\n<u>Edwardian Opulence.
