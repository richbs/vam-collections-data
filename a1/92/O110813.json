Sumptuously embroidered and accessorised with jewels, these gowns provided a glittering show at receptions and balls, the opera or the theatre.  Some were specially commissioned for a specific occasion, and worn only once, others bear evidence of alterations.\n\nThis dress is embroidered with silk thread and sequins from top to bottom, which would have been very expensive as it was done entirely by hand.  It would have been sent out to one of the many specialist workshops in Paris, and each tiny sequin and stitch placed individually by a team of highly-skilled embroiderers.\n\nThe dress was worn with a pair of full-length black evening gloves.",
