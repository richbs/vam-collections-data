The same decoration is repeated on the back of the dish. On the base is the mark Caihua Tang zhi (made for the Hall of Many-Coloured Flowers) written in overglaze red within a double circle.\n\nThis very distinctive design is related to Tibetan Buddhism, probably inspired by a headdress known as a 'five-leaf crown', the five leaves representing the five Buddhas Vairocana (centre), Aksobhya (east), Ratnasambhava (south), Amitabha (west) and Amogha (north).
