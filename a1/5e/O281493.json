This tile is decorated with a scene from the epic Iranian poem that tells the partly mythical history of Iran, known as Firdawsi's Shanamah (Book of Kings), a sixty thousand line work. The tales were recorded in manuscripts, many beautifully illustrated, for Iranian rulers by the leading court painters. In this scene, probably copied from a contemporary lithograph, Rustam, a legendary warrior of early Iran in the service of the Caliph (King), captures the Emperor of China, riding on his white elephant. The design reveals the influence of European perspective and realistic depictions, probably derived from the increasing availability of Western publications and prints, and Western-style painting academys. The lithographic printing process was introduced to Iran in the 1840s, and almost immediately inexpensive copies of the great classics were produced and widely circulated in this new style. \n\nIn the mid 19th century, tiles were sold as individual objects for display, rather than as multi-part friezes, many were acquired by Western tourists and visitors as souvenirs. Major-General Robert Murdoch Smith, who was an engineer working as Director of the Persian Telegraph Company, had been puchasing Iranian art for the South Kensingnton Museum (as the V&amp;A was then known), and acquired this and another tile, now in the Royal Scottish Museum, Edinburgh, on his last trip in 1887, directly from the potter, Ali Muhammad, of Isfahani, who had moved to Tehran to work. Murdoch Smith purchased several tile panels from Ali Muhammad, between 1884 and 1887.",
