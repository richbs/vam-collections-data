The type of pattern repeat used was known as a point repeat, in which the pattern appeared in mirror image to either side of a central axis. This gave quite a formal effect to the pattern, but the overall effect could be lightened with delicate drawing of the individual motifs. In this case a trailling pattern resembling lace has been included. A lady at Court in the period, Mrs Delaney, described a dress she wore in 1729 as having \"a running pattern like lace in the ground\".",
