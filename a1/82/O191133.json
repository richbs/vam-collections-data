It represents a type of poster that was designed in a \u2018before text\u2019 version by professional artists and then made available to district electoral offices by the party headquarters.\n  \nThe idea for the composition of the poster, which depicts a landscape, was triggered by the SZDSZ logo, consisting of three birds in the national colours. Gy\u00f6rgy Kara, the designer of the logo is also the author of the poster. Kara, joined later by his colleague P\u00e9ter Nagy, created a well functioning and clearly identifiable system of printed materials for the party. They had to consider the poor financial environment and improvisations were often unavoidable.  The design was therefore kept extremely simple. The schematic landscape with the soaring birds, however, does not fail to achieve an effect of clarity, freedom and cheerfulness.\n\nAt the bottom we can see another logo \u2019de\u2019 standing for \u2019demokratikus ellenz\u00e9k\u2019 (democratic opposition). The particle \u2019de\u2019 also has its own meaning that can be roughly translated as \u2019yes, indeed\u2019, \u2019for all that,\u2019 \u2019you bet\u2019.",
