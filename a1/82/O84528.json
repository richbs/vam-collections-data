The date [in the inscription], presumably written by the artist of from indications by him, had not previously been recorded.  Holmes, p. 246, had dated the sketch on stylistic grounds c.1823.\n\nConstable first moved to Hampstead in the summer of 1819: he rented Albion Cottage, Upper Heath, towards the end of August (Beckett, II, p. 253).  On 2 November 1819 Farington noted in his diary \u201cHe [Constable] brought two pictures, Studies on Hampstead Heath, which he had painted\u201d (Greig, Vol. VIII, p. 234).  No. 171 is possibly one of the studies shown to Farington on this occasion.\n\nConstable used No. 171 as the sketch for many paintings of Hampstead Heath at Branch Hill Pond.  Among them are:\ni.\tNo. 301 in this Catalogue.  23 \u00bd x 30 \u00bd ins.  Exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1828.\nii.\tTate Gallery No. 1275. 10 x 30 ins.  Painted for W. G. Jennings in 1836.  Bequeathed by Miss Isabel Constable.\nThis version has a rainbow and a windmill added to the scene.  (L. ed. S., Pl. XII, in colour)\niii.\tTate Gallery No. 1813.  13 x 19 \u00bd ins.  Painted for Jack Bannister.  Bequeathed by Henry Vaughan.  (L. ed. S., Pl. 84)\niv.\tA painting sold as Lot 126 at the Henry Hebbert sale held at Messrs. Christie\u2019s, 21 April 1894.  24 \u00bd x 31 \u00bc ins.\nIn his catalogue entry of Tate Gallery No. 1275 (which was then in the National Gallery), Davies (p. 29) lists iii as a related design; he also gives the evidence for identifying the scene as Branch Hill Pond.  Constable may also have used this sketch in preparing those paintings by him of the Branch Hill Pond which have different compositions; for example, the cow drinking from the water on the left recurs in the design engraved by Lucas as \u2018Hampstead Heath\u2019 (S. 51).\n(See also No. 251 [339-1888])",
