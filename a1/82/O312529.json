It is made by George Gammon Adams. \n\nDisraeli (1804-1881) was an English novelist, politician and Prime Minister and is recognised primarily for achievements in imperial and foreign affairs, especially with the 1878 conflict between Russia and Turkey relating the Bulgarians. This lead to the Congress of Berlin summoned by Prince Bismarck, where then a settlement was reached - largely due to Disraeli - to give the Bulgarians a qualified independence.\n\nGeorge Gammon Adams (b. 1821-1898) was a portrait sculptor and medallist. He designed and exhibited prize medals for the Great Exhibition. In 1852 he was chosen to model the death mask of Wellington. One of his public monuments is the 'Napier' statue in Trafalgar square.\n\nThe roundel was among the items given to the Museum by I. D. Adams, the daughter of  George Gammon Adams, in 1980. In total, 196 items were included in the Adams gift, which consisted of many models for medals as well as the busts and figurative sculpture. In most instances it is not possible to date conclusively the many models included in this gift.",
