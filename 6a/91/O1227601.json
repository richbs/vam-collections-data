            "history_note": "The boombox is an icon of 1980s urban street culture. Whether carried on the street, used as the music for a party, or featured in television and film, the boombox was potent both sonically and symbolically. First appearing in the mid-1970s, they became popular just as the Sony Walkman did, around 1980/1981 \u2013 an interesting occurrence of a technology being miniaturized and scaled up at the same time. From a technical point of view, the boombox improved on previous transistor radios by combining several functions in one device: a tapedeck, radio (this example with AM, FM, and two shortwave bands), sound control, and powerful speakers (this example putting out 20 watts in each of its two channels). This integration also allowed for recording from the radio, a microphone, or in some models, from tape to tape. So the boombox could be used like an amateur studio, to create a unique \u2018mix tape\u2019 that could be played at parties, or decorated and kept or given as a gift \u2013 an important everyday design practice in its own right. \n\nBut the physical presence of the boombox was what made it culturally important. These were big, heavy objects (made heavier by the D batteries that powered them), and playing them loudly in public was an unmissable act of autonomy and aggression. As the slang term \u2018ghetto blaster\u2019 implies, the boombox became indelibly associated in the 1980s with poor urban neighbourhoods, and with African-American hip hop culture in particular \u2013 a strong ethnic association that is unusual in product design. Though it did catch on elsewhere to some extent, New York City was the undoubted capital of the boombox, despite the fact that the leaders in manufacturing the radios were halfway around the world in Japan: firms like JVC, Aiwa, Rising and Toshiba. \n\nSpike Lee\u2019s Do The Right Thing  memorably places a boombox at the symbolic heart of its narrative of racism and neighbourhood identity. The otherwise silent character Radio Raheem plays Public Enemy at high volume, leading to a fateful confrontation with local Italians in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. This fictional rendition is echoed by the real-world backlash against the huge radios, which were sometimes targeted by police as public nuisances (a phenomenon that continues in laws passed today against loud car stereos).",

            "historical_context_note": "The object is a gift by Mr. Lyle Owerko, the leading American boombox collector, and author of The Boombox Project , a cultural history published in 2010. It is the object featured on the book\u2019s cover, which is a primary motivation for this choice from his collection. It is an unusually forceful rendition of the form, with \u2018crash bars\u2019 (to protect the speaker mesh, a detail bespeaking the vigorous use of such objects), stark graphic design, and two red lighting strips that flash according to the speakers\u2019 playback volume.",
