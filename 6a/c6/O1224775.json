The dress has been made up from kit form and the pre printed lines for cutting the pattern pieces are still visible in the inside of the hems. The dress has been machine stitched together along the major seams with a machine lace trim around the collar and cuffs hand stitched on. The dress has a wide but high scooped neck and 3/4 length wide sleeves. The dress is a loose fitting A-line shape probably designed to finish around or just above the knee for a child of about 7 years old. Under the proper left sleeve at the front the hem has come undone from where the dress was assembled, revealing the tabular cuts to create the seam.",
