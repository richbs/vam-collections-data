He took his idea to the BBC programme 'Dragon's den' in 2006 where it failed to gain approval. It has since taken to the shops where it has proved successful. They are designed specifically so that the child can sit on them, with wheels, giving the chance for the child to wheel themselves or have an adult pull them along. The idea is to alleviate boredom whilst waiting in airports or at train stations. It also allows the child to imitate adult behaviour and feel more grown-up by carrying their own possessions, with innovative twists such as the straps inside being referred to as a 'seat belt' for a teddy bear. \n\nThe object was acquired for the 2010 exhibition 'Sit Down: Seating for Kids', as an example of a unique, modern-day design. It is designed to look like a tiger, though other examples such as a ladybird, gruffalo and a bumble bee are now available. It was displayed in the 'Children on the Move' section of the exhibition.",
