His attention to detail and ability to create visually stunning and decorative costumes were aspects of his work that appealed to producers and public alike, and led to his constant stream of work throughout his life.  He was a well known illustrator of children's books as well as a costume designer, but it was his detailed and superbly decorative designs for the Empire Theatre ballet costumes from 1908 to 1915, led to an obituary writer noting: \"The name C. Wilhelm should be written in gold on the history of ballet\".\n\nThe acquisition of some of Wilhelm's designs for \"The Mousme\" is especially welcome for the Theatre Museum, which also holds the designs he did for the gentlemen's costumes in \"The Mikado\" at the Savoy Theatre twenty-six years earlier.  A fashion for all things Japanese had first made an impression in Britain in the 1860's and has been given new impetus in London by the 1884 Japanese Village Exhibition in Knightsbridge.  By 1885, Japanese artefacts imported to London had started a craze for Japonism.  \"We are all being more or less Japanned\" wrote the Daily Telegraph theatre critic after the first night of \"The Mikado\", and the popularity of a Japanese setting had not lost its appeal as late as 1911 when Wilhelm designed these costumes for \"The Mousme\", a musical by Lionel Monckton and Howard Talbot at London's Shaftesbury Theatre, which opened on 9th September.\n\nCatherine Haill",
