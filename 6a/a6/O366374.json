Feathers could be plucked from the tail feathers of a live bird without arming it.  The demand for feathers was very high and around this time the hunting of ostriches also started. Feathers were sent in great numbers in New York while the centre of the market of feathers took place in London. \nOstrich fans as well as boas and hats, reached wide popularity from the 1915s. Feathers were mounted or glued in different arrangements on different materials including tortoiseshell. \nFor the most precious  examples, and for special occasions, feathers were dyed in the same shade as the dress worn.The intense and luxuorious orange tone of the present example is evocative of the Oriental world; feathers were seen as highly exotic objects which were highly fahionable at the time.  Following the new elongated silhouette of dresses fans also became bigger, longer and wing shaped.",
