The grasshopper, a heraldic pun on the name Gresham ('Gres' is the Anglo-Saxon word for grass), grasps the letter 'M' for Lady Mary Gresham. Lady Mary was wife of Sir John Gresham (1492-1556), who was knighted in 1537, became Lord Mayor in 1547, and was the founder of Gresham's School in his birthplace, Holt, Norfolk.\n\nThe quarry comes from Titsey Place, Limpsfield, Surrey, former home of the Leveson-Gower family, descendants of the Greshams. If, as seems likely, the quarry was made specifically for Titsey Place, which Sir John bought in 1534, it can be dated to between 1534 and 1538.",
