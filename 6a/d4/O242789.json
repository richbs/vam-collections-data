The images themselves Yamamoto tones and deliberately stains, tears, marks and creases to create a worn patina.  Most are no larger than 3 x 5 inches and have the feel of 'found' objects.\n\n'R-25(B)' allows for more intimate interaction with Yamamoto\u2019s work, as it is designed to be held by the viewer.  It is a gelatin silver print set in resin in a found tin box, and is a unique object.  It makes an interesting counterpoint to the historic collection of other cased photographs such as daguerreotypes and ambrotypes.",
