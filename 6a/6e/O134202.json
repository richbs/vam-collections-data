During a protracted military engagement in 1659, the two men arranged a truce in order to meet in a tented enclosure, virtually alone. Both came armed: Shivaji wore mail under his clothes and metal skull protection under his turban. He also held metal \"tiger claws\" of this kind concealed in his hand. The two men fought and Shivaji disembowelled his opponent. \n\nThe claws are accompanied by a fitted case that is inscribed: \"The 'Wagnuck' of Sivajee With Which He Killed the Moghul General. This Relic was given to Mr. James Grant-Duff of Eden When he was Resident at Satara By the Prime Minister of the Peshwa of the Marathas\".",
