They welded together furniture and objects from scrap metal and recycled elements, but quickly Brazier-Jones's work became more sophisticated.  The Atlantis Chair was one of his most successful designs and shows his interest in historical motifs.  The references are oblique and non-specific but allude particularly to grand French Empire furniture of the early  nineteenth century, which was often decorated with cast gilt bronze mounts derived from animal forms, like the wings and hoofed legs on this chair. The curved rear legs recall the shape of sabres, a convention also found on Empire furniture. Between 1989 and 1994 Brazier-Jones made an edition of 100 cast bronze Atlantis chairs, and 100 cast in aluminium.  This is an early prototype from 1988, retained by Brazier-Jones, which he reupholstered in 2001.",
