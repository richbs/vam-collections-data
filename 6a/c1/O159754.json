He exhibited paintings at the Salons of 1866 and 1868 and began making 'rustic' pottery on a visit home to Vinay in that year. He exhibited his ceramics in 1869 at l'Union Centrale des Beaux-Arts Appliqu\u00e9s \u00e0 'Industrie (when this example was purchased from him, his address then at Boulevard de Montparnasse 8).  In 1870 Fantin-Latour painted 'The Studio at Batignelles' (now in the Louvre) showing on the table a cast from the antique and a Laurent Bouvier pot.  In 1872 he exhibited his ceramics for the last time, probably at the Durand-Ruel gallery, before ill-health brought a halt to his ceramics.",
