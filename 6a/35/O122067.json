Sometimes the 'lazy lines' have been paired and within them are sections of darker weft.\n\nPILE: wool: 7 colours: dark yellow (difficult to distinguish; it may have faded from something else), yellow, dark blue, light blue, dark brown, brown (which has probably faded from something else), white; symmetrical knot tied around 2 threads; 52 knots per sq. inch (791 per sq. dm).\n\nSIDE FINISH: 2 cords overcast with yellow wool\n\nEND FINISH: Lower: incomplete but with a maximum of 2 cms. of plain weave with cream wool; Upper: missing.\n\nDESIGN: Described as woven.  Field: light blue ground with long, 5-sided panel in dark blue with stepped niche at lower end.  A long, vertical central stem bears 20 pairs of fruit and ends in three stylised blossoms, all in yellow.  24 pairs of small lillies in yellow, dark yellow and blue emerge from the sides.  Outside the panel, the field is heavily decorated with bands of 11 or 10 and two halves of bowls containing three yellow or dark yellow flowerheads.  These form a single column on either side of the panel and a single band along the upper edge.  There is a band beyond the field's lower edge which has diagonal lines (in both directions) of small, faint lozenges in dark yellow on yellow.\n\nBORDERS: There are nine, described from the inside:\n(1) white ground with arabesque meander in dark yellow, yellow, light blue and light brown\n\n(2) , (4), (6) and (8): yellow ground with a sprig with a single light brown or yellow blossom.\n\n(3) and (7): dark brown ground with dark yellow, yellow and light brown sprigs\n\n(5) and (9): white ground with dark yellow, yellow and light brown sprigs.",
