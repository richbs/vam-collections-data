She draws 'freehand' with a mouse using a relatively simple programme. The computer drawings are based on pencil sketches and paintings done of actual landscape views.\n\nSeven of these drawings, along with an essay and descriptive captions, were published by Occasional Works, a small Californian press, in this accordion-fold, limited edition book in 1993.\n\nThe seven landscapes in this perspex bound book are all of places 'away from home' for Hollister, among them: Vermont in the United States, Prevessin in France, St. Anton in Austria, and Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia.\n\nThe work blends the computer drawn landscapes with the traditional letterpress printing of the text elements.\n\nFor Hollister, the simplicity of her tools and their effects are significant, 'I was interested in the challenges posed by the narrow choice of grays (really combinations of black and white squares) and by the small size and scale of the black and white image seen on the screen'.\n\nEach of the original landscapes has been 'translated' using the computer to produce a new interpretation of its beauty.",
