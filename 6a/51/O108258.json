            "public_access_description": "Founded in 1903 by the architect Joseph Hoffman and the painter Koloman Moser with financial backing from the industrialist Fritz Waerndorfer, the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte sought to produce decorative arts of exceptional design and craftsmanship. \n\nThe fashion department of the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte opened in 1910 under the direction of Edward Wimmer. Begun during a time of financial difficulties, the popularity of the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte\u2019s fashion and textiles production and its retail outlets in Vienna and abroad helped sustain the organisation through the 1920s. Although printed textiles, on linen, cotton or silk, were by far the most common type of textile produced under the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte label, some tulle or net textiles and trimmings were also made. In 1917 a specialist shop was opened in Vienna to sell the textile department\u2019s products which included not only printed silks and cottons but also ribbons, lace and embroidery.\n\nThis net dress was possibly designed around 1920 by Edward Wimmer who remained the director of the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte\u2019s fashion department until 1922. Its material and applied tulle ruffles are similar to a dress photographed in 1920 that was designed by Wimmer. The dress is not lined and would have been worn over a petticoat. The silhouette of the dress is intriguing because it is very fashionable, more so than Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte designs of a decade earlier. According to Angela Volker, Viennese expert in Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte, the organisation's fashion production at this time was not particularly special, producing clothing that was commercially successful but less distinctive than in earlier years. With its fairly short skirt, bare arms and dropped waist the dress has the shape and similar details to dresses  in Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte drawings and advertising of 1919, as depicted in Volker\u2019s book \u2018\u2019Weinermode + Modephotografie\u2019, page 140.",
