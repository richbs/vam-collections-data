It is made of looped pile Brussels carpeting in wool and jute. The design, of meandering bluebell stems interspersed with daffodils, marks the interest of Arts and Crafts designers in the forms and colours of British garden flowers, which inspired many repeating patterns for textiles.\n\nWalter Crane was a founder member and first president of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society.  He was one of the best known and most versatile artists and designers of his generation and designed tapestries, carpets and woven and printed fabric amongst many other types of object.  He also worked as a painter and book illustrator.  \n\nJames Templeton & Co., established in 1839 in Glasgow, became a foremost producer of artistic carpeting in the 1880s, buying patterns from designers like Voysey, Day and the Silver Studio.  They were particularly interested in the work of the Glasgow School of Art, employing a number of ex-students.",
