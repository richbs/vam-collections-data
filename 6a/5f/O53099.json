They may have been made for a large saloon or drawing room, or perhaps for a long suite of rooms. The set was probably made in the workshop of William Vile and John Cobb, one of the most accomplished furniture-making firms of the 18th century. Vile\u2019s specialism was carving, and it is likely that he designed these chairs and supervised their making in the workshop. He had trained with William Hallett, who had also made furniture for Lord Shaftesbury from 1744 until his own retirement, in 1752.\n\nThe modern silk covers, put on by the Museum, were dyed to match a surviving fragment of the original, and the chairs have been upholstered in the traditional 18th-century manner, with tufting, piping (or \u2018welting\u2019) and close nailing.",

However, the chairs are unlikely to date from before 1755 at the very earliest, and Hallett appears to have effectively retired in the early 1750s (though he afterwards provided financial backing to the partnership of Vile & Cobb, established c. 1752). William Vile, who had been Hallett's principal journeyman, is quite likely to have retained the custom of Lord Shaftesbury. A stylistic link is presented by the stools supplied by Vile & Cobb to The Vyne, Hampshire, in 1753, which have similar feet in the form of architectural guttae (Anthony Coleridge, <i>Chippendale Furniture</i> (1968), p. 27, fig. 28).",
