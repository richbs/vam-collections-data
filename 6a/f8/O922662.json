They depict church festivals and weddings, typically feature drunken behaviour, and often end in fights. This emerged from a longer tradition in poems and in farces performed at banquets and carnival processions. The peasants in this set by Hans Sebald Beham have names (based on the names of the months), recalling the practice of using named participants in the poems and plays. \n\nBeham's peasants appear in different formats, suggesting a wide-ranging market and different uses. These engravings are of small size and were perhaps aimed at collectors or were pasted into books. Larger versions of these same peasants appear in a frieze on the wall in an engraving by Frans Huys entitled The Lute Maker's Shop.",

There is evidence of such images in positive settings, including an external wall-painting for a wealthy goldsmiths house (Haus zum Tanz in Basel) designed by Holbein around 1520 and sculptures on fountains and bookbindings to religious books.\n\nBeham's peasants appear in different formats, suggesting a wide-ranging market and different uses. Large pictorial woodcuts covering more than one sheet might have been displayed on a wall. A woodcut made in 1528 with a poem in Latin by Hans Sachs must have aimed at a literate audience. As engravings of small size, these sets of couples were perhaps aimed at collectors or were pasted into books. Larger versions of these same peasants appear in a frieze on the wall in an engraving by Frans Huys entitled The Lute Maker's Shop.",
