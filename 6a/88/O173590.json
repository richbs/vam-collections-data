Features delicately stippled and hatched in brown and sanguine with some blue and grey and some white heightening (but see Condition), on a pale carnation ground; hair in a very transparent pale brown wash, hatched over with darker colour and touches of blue-grey; dress in black wash, the lights in pale grey; the jewel picked out in brown and grey with highlights in gold; the pearl in brown wash with a grey and white highlight; background in a solid blue wash, shaded darker to the left and low down; traces of a gold marginal strip; on vellum put down on a leaf from a table-book.  \n \n<u>Frame:</u> The miniature is directly attached to its old, nearly flat bevelled glass and fitted as the centrepiece of the first of two vitrines containing the so-called Leicester House miniatures. The vitrines appear to be constructed in two parts, of possibly different dates. The inner and apparently earlier is a short plank of fruitwood, ebonised on the front, into which oval and circular complex bolection mouldings, cut from a fine-grained ebonised fruitwood, are set, thus providing a rebate for the miniatures. The outer part is a deep picture frame of fruitwood stained dark brown, with a glazed rebate into which the inner part fits. Miniatures in both sets are labelled with apparently late eighteenth- or early nineteenth-century inscriptions on the inner part and carry number labels from South Kensington 1865.The backs of the outer part have been built out with hinged shutters and fitted with brass furniture of the late nineteenth or twentieth century. This work was probably ordered by Lewis, lst Viscount Harcourt (see below), who is recorded on two of the individual object labels (Due d'Alencon and Lord Burghley) as having added them to the set in 1907 and 1911 respectively. The vitrines, and miniatures from both sets, have been conserved; in some instances, such as the Mary Sidney, I they have been heavily restored. This may have been under the aegis of Joseph Duveen, from whom there was a note, which was still preserved in one of the vitrines when they were inspected by the present cataloguer in 1980. Lewis Harcourt's active curatorship of the sets would relate to the fact that he was a trustee of the British Museum, the NPG and the Wallace Collection and was a founder and trustee also of the Museum of London.",

[underlined with a flourish ] <i>/now/ Countess of Leycest[ er]</i>. The inscription is cut in such a way as to suggest that the miniature was originally fitted with the normal locket, which would have been removed by the time the present vitrines were assembled. Also inscribed in a later hand in ink above:<i> Lady</i>, the number 3 in graphite, and in the lower part of the oval the number 1712. The inner part of the vitrine bears a label written in ink in an eighteenth- or early nineteenth-century hand: <i>Lady /Dorothy /Percy / Countess of Leicester.</i>  \n \n<b>Frame:</b> The miniature is directly attached to its old, nearly flat bevelled glass and fitted as the centrepiece of the first of two vitrines containing the so-called Leicester House miniatures. The vitrines appear to be constructed in two parts, of possibly different dates. The inner and apparently earlier is a short plank of fruitwood, ebonised on the front, into which oval and circular complex bolection mouldings, cut from a fine-grained ebonised fruitwood, are set, thus providing a rebate for the miniatures. The outer part is a deep picture frame of fruitwood stained dark brown, with a glazed rebate into which the inner part fits. Miniatures in both sets are labelled with apparently late eighteenth- or early nineteenth-century inscriptions on the inner part and carry number labels from South Kensington 1865.The backs of the outer part have been built out with hinged shutters and fitted with brass furniture of the late nineteenth or twentieth century. This work was probably ordered by Lewis, lst Viscount Harcourt (see below), who is recorded on two of the individual object labels (Due d'Alencon and Lord Burghley) as having added them to the set in 1907 and 1911 respectively. The vitrines, and miniatures from both sets, have been conserved; in some instances, such as the Mary Sidney, I they have been heavily restored. This may have been under the aegis of Joseph Duveen, from whom there was a note, which was still preserved in one of the vitrines when they were inspected by the present cataloguer in 1980. Lewis Harcourt's active curatorship of the sets would relate to the fact that he was a trustee of the British Museum, the NPG and the Wallace Collection and was a founder and trustee also of the Museum of London.  \n \n<b>Provenance:</b> From a collection of miniatures belonging to the Sidneys, Earls of Leicester of the second creation; seen by Vertue at Leicester House in 1735: 'at Leicester house many Limnings - paintings of all kinds'. There follow details of several recognisable limnings, including the Hilliard <i>Self - Portrait</i> and the portrait of his father, both now V&A, of which Vertue comments: 'The gilt mettal Frames. first made for them was taken away and the two pictures sett in a gold Snuffbox - by the present Earl of Leicester, who had them from his Brother, but I wish them to be returned into their old Frames again.\" (2)  Vertue also noted: 'The collection of pictures limnings &c or drawings that heretofore was in the Lord Leicesters house in London - are now in the posession of Mr Perry Esqr.(3) who marryd a Neece of Lord John Earl of Leicester. - and as he has also great part of the Estate of Penshurst in Kent so he there has all the pictures furniture, manuscripts, papers &C.'(4) This notebook was begun in 1741; Jocelyn, the last Earl of Leicester died on 7 July 1743, but his will was not proved until 1746 and not implemented until the death of his widow in November 1747; so the date of this entry is c.1748-50, not 1734 as given by Roy Strong (see below). From Penshurst, the miniatures seem to have descended in two main groups, one as described by Strong, remaining at Penshurst until the end of the last century, the other, to which the present miniature belongs, as stated on the label attached to one of the vitrines: 'These miniatures came from Penshurst, and were given to me, by the Hon.ble Mrs Anson to whom they were a legacy from her Aunt the Hon.ble Lady Yonger.' (5) Dr Alastair Hawkyard, quoted by Strong, has elucidated this note: the Hon. Lady Yonge was Anne, daughter of Thomas, 7th Lord Howard of Effingham (1682-1725); she married Sir William Yonge, Bart (c.1693-1755). Although she had a remote connection with the Leicesters through her mother, Philadelphia Pelham (1654-1686),(6) because the miniatures were said to have come from Penshurst, Lady Yonge could have acquired them only after about c.1750, that is, long after the family connection could by itself have been the reason.  \n \nAlaistair Laing (7) amplifies this, commenting that the key factor was not Lady Yonge's kinship with the Leicesters, but the nature of her relationship with Mary Sidney (d.17 58; the wife of Sir Brownlow Sherard) who was with her sister Elizabeth (d.1783; married William Perry 1 738; mother of Elizabeth, later Lady Bysshe Shelley, and ancestress of the Lords De l'Isle and Dudley), one of the two co-heirs of Jocelyn, 7th and last (recognised) Earl of Leicester. Horace Walpole (8) called her 'a vulture' and, Alaistair Laing continues: 'She certainly used the relationship to persuade Lady Sherard to leave her half-share of the Sidney heirlooms away from either the Sidney or the Sherard families when she died in 1758, and instead to her, who proceeded to sell most or all of the oil paintings (with significantly, all the Sidney I Leicester identities suppressed) at Langfords on 10 May 1764.' The miniatures which must have been part of Mary Sidney's share of the Leicester inheritance, evidently were not sold, but passed as recorded from the vulture Lady Yonge to her niece.  \n \nLady Yonge's niece Mary Howard (who acquired the surname Anson from a maternal uncle of her second husband) obviously had the same connection through Philadelphia Pelham with the Leicesters, but it was her mother, also called Mary, who provided the connection for the subsequent descent of the miniatures through to the Harcourts. Mary Howard's mother was the first wife of George Venables-Vernon, 1st Baron Vernon (1707/8-1780); his third wife was Martha Harcourt, sister of Simon, 1st Earl Harcourt (d.1ll7); Martha's third son Edward Venables-Vernon (1757-1847), Archbishop of York, succeeded to the Harcourt estates (but not the titles) on the death of the 3rd and last Earl Harcourt (1742/3-1830). The relationships here suggest that Mary, Mrs Anson, may have given the miniatures to her mother Mary (whose handwriting it might therefore be on the label quoted above), from whom they passed through the common husband to Martha, via whom the entire Harcourt plus this Sidney property passed into the possession of the Venables-Vernons around 1830.  \n \nThe Archbishop was succeeded in 1847 by his son George (1 785-1861; his maternal uncle was the Marquis of Stafford) . He was succeeded by his brother, the Reverend William Harcourt (1789-1871), who lent the miniatures to South Kensington in 1865. His heir was his son Edward William (1825-1891), who was succeeded by his son Aubrey (1852-1904), who was in turn briefly succeeded by his uncle Sir William George Grenville Vernon Harcourt (1827 -1904); and he by his son Lewis (1863-1922) , The latter was ennobled in 1917 as Viscount Harcourt and succeeded by William Edward (1908-1979), 2nd Viscount, who died without a male heir. He was succeeded at Stanton Harcourt by his daughter Elizabeth, the Hon. Mrs Gascoigne. \n \n On the death of the 2nd Viscount, the family sought exemption of the miniatures from capital taxes under the provisions of the Finance Act 1976. The present cataloguer inspected the miniatures in 1980 and, recognising their importance, recommended exemption. Subsequently, in 1987, the family decided to offer them to the nation in part settlement of capital tax, and they were accepted by the Museum in 1988. One miniature, however, the portrait identified as Mary Sidney by Nicholas Hilliard, was separated from the group and allocated to the National Portrait Gallery.  \n \n<b>Exhibited:</b> South Kensington 1865, no. 1712.  \n \n<b>Literature:</b> Not specifically mentioned by Vertue in the references above; George Perfect Harding, <i>List of Portraits: Pictures In Various Mansions of the United Kingdom</i>, vol. I (1804) pp. 47 -9; R Strong 'The Leicester House Miniatures: Robert Sidney, 1st Earl of Leicester and his Circle',<i>Burlington Magazine</i>, CXXVII, no. 991 (October 1985), p. 697. \n\nThe history of the miniatures before 1735 is uncertain. The inventory of the pictures at Leicester House in 1677, after the death of Robert, 2nd Earl of Leicester, contains no mention of them and suggests that the house and contents had been largely dismantled by the time the inventory was made.(9)  \n \nDorothy Percy was the eldest surviving child of Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland (c.1564-1632). Known as 'Henry the Wizard' , he was a distinguished mathematician and patron of learning. He is the subject of the famous portrait by Hilliard which shows him reclining as a Melancholic philosopher in an enclosed garden, accompanied by symbols of his intellectual life. Between 1605 and 1621 he was imprisoned in the Tower on suspicion of complicity in the Gunpowder Plot. Dorothy was named after her mother, who was the daughter of Walter Devereux, 1st Earl of Essex. Her marriage to Sir Robert Sidney, 2nd Earl of Leicester (1595-1677) in January 1615 was secret and became generally known only in March 1616. The alliance through her between the Leicesters and the Northumberlands on the moderate Protestant wing of the Court party influenced her husband's political career during the 1630s and 1640s. He, like her father, was perhaps primarily an intellectual and spent long periods in retirement at Penshurst. By Dorothy he had six sons and nine daughters. The eldest daughter, also Dorothy, was Waller's 'Sacharissa', subsequently Countess of Sunderland (see Cat. No. 36).  \n \nTechnically the miniature relates closely to the other portraits of leading Court ladies of the late 1630s, represented here by the <i>Katherine Bruce</i> (Cat. No. 27) and <i>Lady d'Aubigny</i> (Cat. Nos 28 and 29). But for a portrait of this date or later, the sitter seems very young. Were it not for the inscription, which itself reads as though it should have been written soon after the sitter's husband had succeeded to the earldom in 1626, it might be preferable to identify her as the daughter ('Sacharissa'), b.1617, rather than the mother.  \n \n1 Now NPG. \n2 Vertue IV, p. 80. \n3 Mr Perry was the husband of one of the daughters and co-heirs of Jocelyn, 7th Earl of Leicester (see below). When Horace Walpole visited Penshurst in 1753 to look at pictures and other objects, he encountered 'Mr Perry who has availed himself of the partiality which he found you had for me, and passed upon you from my friend ... when he went out of his own drawing-room at Penshurst, \nthat Mr Chute and I might see it, and then I said \"Sir, I hope we don't disturb you\"; he grunted something and walked away -la belle amitie ... !' Letter to Sir Horace Mann , 21 July 1753 (<i>The Yale Edition of Horace Walpole's Correspondence </i>, ed. W S Lewis (New Haven and Oxford, 1960, vol. XX, p. 389). \n4 Penshurst was the principal seat of the Leicesters.
