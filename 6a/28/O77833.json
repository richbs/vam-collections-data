Japanese export cups of this early period did not have handles. The blue, red and gold colour scheme is typical of the so-called Imari style, which was much copied by 18th-century European manufacturers.\n\n Place\nThe Imari style is named after the port in western Japan through which this and other products of the nearby Arita kilns were shipped. Porcelain for export was sent to Deshima, a small island in Nagasaki harbour, for shipment abroad by Dutch and Chinese merchants.\n\n Time\nFrom 1639 to the mid-1850s merchants of the Dutch East India Company were the only Europeans permitted to conduct trade in Japan. This was due to the Japanese government's seclusion policy, which was enforced during this period. Hard-paste porcelain comparable in quality to Chinese and Japanese imports was first made at Meissen in Germany in the early years of 18th century. Porcelain was made in Britain from the late 1740s onwards.",
