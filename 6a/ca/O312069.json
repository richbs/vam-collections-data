This bust, which was formerly at Gordon Castle, was commissioned by Alexander 2nd Duke of Gordon (d. 1728), probably during his visit to Florence in 1717, in gratitude for favours received from Grand Duke Cosimo III. \n\nThe foremost Florentine sculptor of the late Baroque period, Foggini began to receive commissions for sculpture from the Medici court as early as 1676. A decade later he was appointed grand ducal sculptor and in 1694, court architect. Foggini carved several portraits of the Medici dynasty.\n\nDress and adornment were important in expressing identity.  Here, the Duke's attire conveys his status and power, notably with the armour, displaying the scallop-edged breast plate and part of the cross of Santo Stefano on his chest, and the swathe of drapery - presenting him as warrior or knight. In contrast, the sculptor has skillfully conjured up the delicate and intricate needlework of the lace cravat, which was not only expensive but also highly fashionable. The elevation of the bust on an elaborate pedestal, and the slight turn of the moustached face with flowing locks, add to the impressive presence of the ducal image.",

Foggini, the foremost Florentine scultpor of the late Baroque period, began to receive commissions for sculpture from the Medici court as early as 1676. After Ferdinando Tacca's death in 1687, Foggini was appointed grand-ducal sculptor and within a decade became the court architect as well.\n\nThe bust of Cosimo III was commissioned by Alexander, Duke of Gordon, in gratitude for favours received from the Grand-Duke, probably during the Duke's visit to Florence in 1717. This episode is recorded by Baldinucci in the manuscript of Foggini's life (Anna Matteoli, Francesco Saverio Bandinucci, Vite di artisti dei secoli XVII-XVIII prima edizione integrale del codice palatino 563, Rome, 1975, p.384, 170.c; see Lankheit 1962, p.237). The bust is documented at Gordon Castle, Fochabers, Banffshire by Gordon in 1754 and later by Forsyth, Sinclair and Seton (<u>op. cit.</u>). There are two replicas of the present bust, one on the fa\u00e7ade of San Jacopo oltr'Arno in Florence for which Foggini received a payment on 10 June 1721, and another for the fa\u00e7ade of the Palazzo dei Cavalieri in Pisa, made in or after 1723.\n\nAcquired in London by Dr W. L. Hildburgh, F.S.A. and given to the Museum in 1948.",
