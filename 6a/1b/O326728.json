The jambs have gilt brass mouldings chased with acanthus foliage at the bottom and central pilasters extending over the mantel. The pilaster are multi-angular with three-sided bases and semi-cylindrical capitals and are decorated with recessed polygonal rods decorated with pairs of diagonal flutes.  Pierced steel ornaments are applied at intervals between the pilasters and the outer edges of the jambs.  The mantel has a feature of nine blue semi-cylindrical columns reducing in diameter from the centre one outwards and etched with gilt foliage. The spaces on each side are filled with recessed saltires with pierced ornaments alternately of steel and gilt brass. The mantel shelf projects and was originally covered with another plate that is now missing and so it has been inverted and the former underside polished to form the top. The flat surrounds of the opening are etched with conventional foliage and set at intervals with gilt copper foliage.  All the main edges are decorated with applied beading.\n[Fender] The fender is bowed out in the middle and mounted on five ball feet and consist of an upper and lower rail, the space between filled with pierced tracery executed in studded cut steel and incorporating eleven floral wreaths, each framing an oval plate to which is applied a pair of gilt brass sprays. The fronts of the rails are decorated alternately with circles of studs and oval gilt copper bosses chased with leaves. The top rail is surmounted by thirteen studded finials set alternately with twelve faceted knobs. The inside of the fender is partly filled by a plate carrying three vertical hooked rods supporting poker, tongs and shovel, all decorated with cut steel work.\n[Urn] The largest urn has a cup-shaped bowl, moulded stem and square base all of studded cut-steel work. The junction of bowl and stem is covered by a gilt brass moulding chased with foliage from below which projects a series of cut steel acanthus leaves (of which five are missing). The cover is bell-shaped and of gilt brass chased with foliage and raised on seven in curved beaded strips. It is surmounted by a studded steel knob and has a flanged steel rim decorated with applied steel balls.\n[Urn] Mantel ornament, one of a pair, of ovoid body, conical stem and square base, the body formed of eight vertical steel strips set with steel balls and framing gilt copper panels decorated with engraved and applied foliage, On top is a gilt tube set within four pierced and studded steel hoops surrounded by a cut-steel finial and springing from a gilt coronet. The stem and base are of studded cut steel the latter mounted on a gilt copper plate edged with foliage.\n[Urn] Mantel ornament, one of a pair, of ovoid body, conical stem and square base, the body formed of eight vertical steel strips set with steel balls and framing gilt copper panels decorated with engraved and applied foliage, On top is a gilt tube set within four pierced and studded steel hoops surrounded by a cut-steel finial and springing from a gilt coronet.
