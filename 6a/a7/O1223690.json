The plate has no footring, and is glazed on both sides with the exception of the flat base.\n\nAccording to Suzanne Katkhuda, the plate was made on a jigger. When leather hard, slip was applying on a banding wheel. It was then biscuit fired to 1020 degrees C, after which it was painted and glazed and fired again to 1120 degrees C, with a 10 minute soak to avoid crazing.",

The earliest plates were made without footrings. Production was later moved to Brixworth, near Northampton.\n\nHoldenby Designs was established by Suzanne Katkhuda and Jim Powell in 1987 to manufacture and sell Katkhuda's designs. The company was first based in the stable yard of Holdenby House, a stately home in Northamptonshire. These premises were rapidly outgrown, and at the end of 1991 the company moved to the nearby village of Brixworth. In 1993, further premises were acquired in Parsonage Street, Tunstall, Stoke-on-Trent, where white earthenware was produced.",
