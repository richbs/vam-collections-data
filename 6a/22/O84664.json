Its use of continuous leather upholstery over seat and back, the double leg stretchers at varying heights and the brass-capped feet would have made the design unusually advanced in 1905. However, the overall effect of the chair is somewhat severe. Perhaps this helps to explain why this chair model does not seem to have been in production as long as a comparable, more graceful, chair by Otto Wagner designed in 1901.",
