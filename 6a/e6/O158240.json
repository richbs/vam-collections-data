The idea, and the materials, both came from Asia. Cane seats and backs made the chairs much lighter than those conventionally upholstered and within a few years the new form of seating became extremely popular, creating a threat to both the makers of woollen cloth and the upholsterers. The older trades presented petitions to parliament but could not stop the rise of the new trade. This produced tens of thousands of caned chairs each year, chiefly in London, and many of them were exported. This chair, with its front legs and back panel both showing the motif of S-scrolls, was one of the most popular patterns for such chairs from the 1680s.\n\nOn loan to Provost Skeen's House.",
