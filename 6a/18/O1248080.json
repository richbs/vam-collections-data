The deep sea diver complete with  metal look helmet and tool belt with weapons, could be submerged in a bucket of water, and, by blowing through a rubber tube attached to the top of his helmet, the diver would rise up again in the water. The toy is made of cellulose acetate, which, at the time, was an experimental form of early plastic often used for toys.",
