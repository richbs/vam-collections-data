The three sides of each triangle are different in colour, and each side has a number printed at its edge.  These numbers run from one to ten and are scientifically arrange at the edge of the triangles so that they may be matched with each other, or added together to form the scoring combinations in the game.  Players try, by matching colour and number, or matching colour and making certain score totals, to play all the triangles from their hands and to make as large a score as possible.  The player, who plays all his triangles first, receives his full score, while those who hold triangles at the end of the hand suffer penalties.  The player who has the highest score at the end of the game wins.\n\nPreparation:-\nTo start the game, take all the triangles from the box and place them face down in the centre of the table around which the players are sitting.  Mix them very thoroughly and then let each draw five triangles at random.  Each player should then lay his five triangles on the table in front of him, face up, so that he and all other players may see just what triangles are in each hand.\nThe player who is found to ave the lowest triangle plays it to the centre of the table thus starting the game.  (The lowest triangle is the one with the three numbers which add up to the lowest total.  The lowest triangle in the game is the one having the figures one, two, three on its three sides which, of course, add up to the total of six.)  Play passes to the left clockwise around the table.  Only one triangle may be played on each turn and a player must always play if possible.\n\n*FOR METHODS OF PLAY AND THE DIFFERENT GAMES WHICH MAY BE PLAYED SEE THE RULES BOOK (photocopy)",
