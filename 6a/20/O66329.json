She had the opportunity of continuing her singing studies at La Scala, but her family felt she was too young, and after a bout of TB affected her voice she abandoned grand opera for the variety stage, appearing with concert groups including The Seven Romps in1912 and then in various double acts with other girls including The Trilbies with Eileen Lawler in 1913, touring the Near East and Asia as well as Britain, and with Evelyn Kirkby as Kirkby & Harrington.  She appeared in pantomime in London and the regions as well as in variety.",
