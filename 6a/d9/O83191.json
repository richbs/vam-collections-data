They approached a subject from a variety of angles, above and below, to express the speed and dislocation of modern life. The result was a refreshed perception and appreciation of even the most everyday subjects and surroundings. Here, the ritual of washing hands becomes a study of forms, textures and dynamics. Nevertheless, the subject loses none of its human appeal.",
