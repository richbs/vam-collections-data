The rosary, used to help make sure that prayers were said correctly, was banished from Protestant countries.  In the south it was commonly worn as an ornament, as well as a declaration of Catholic identity.\n\nThe main purpose of this rosary must have been decorative, as it is far too fragile to have been used for counting prayers on a regular basis.  The shape of the filigree cross, and crown above it, are typical of Italian rosaries.  It was bought as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
