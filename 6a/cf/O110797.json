For instance, Philip II of Spain, who reigned from 1556 to1598, possessed a set folding chairs from China, that can still be seen at the El Escorial Palace outside Madrid. This table is thought to have been made in Spain, although the table top is decorated with birds, trees and flowers in the style of Chinese silks.  The gold painting on black also echoes the characteristic colour scheme of Chinese or Japanese lacquer, which would have been highly valued in Spain at the time. It is an early example of the influence of Asian furniture on European design. But several aspects of its construction follow Spanish design, including the typical iron bracing bars and the divisions of the decoration of the top into geometrical panels.  This dividing up of the decoration was also found on the sides of cabinets made in such different centres as Antwerp, Naples and Madrid at that time.",
