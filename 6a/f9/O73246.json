ISBN 1851773088.\nThurston Thompson, the Museum's photographer, was sent to photograph Santiago Cathedral in order to complement the immense cast of the Cathedral's late-twelfth-century west portico. At the same time as the photographs were taken, the cast was being made by Domenico Brucciani, J.C.Robinson used photographs to provide an impression of the context of the original work. Thus, two forms of reproduction were employed in the Museum to establish what was thereafter to be regarded as one of the canonical works of medieval art.\nRobinson first saw the portico in 1865, describing it in a letter to Cole as \"\"incomparably the most important monument of sculpture and ornamental detail of its epoch...[I]n abstract relative importance as a work of art this is on a par with the gates of Ghiberti\"\". In his eyes it was \"\"one of those extraordinary and unique works, in which a great artist seems at one bound to have emancipated himself from contemporary mannerism and produced a masterpiece for all time.\"\" Following his return to South Kensington, Robinson successfully argued for Brucciani and his team to be sent to Santiago, and for Thurston Thompson to accompany him to record the form and the setting of the doorway. Robinson was exacting in his detailed instructions as to where Thompson was to set up his camera specifying precise viewpoints such as \"\"General view of the cathedral and its adjoining buildings from betwixt the 9th and 10th tree at the roadside\"\".\nThe portico is concealed behind the later west front, and Robinson was not confident that Thurston Thompson would be able to photograph the dark interior of the building, which would require exposure of many minutes. Indeed, even this exterior view shows evidence of a long exposure, with a \"\"ghost\"\" figure visible to the right of the steps in the foreground - presumably a person who grew tired of waiting for the picture to be finished and walked off while the exposure was underway. Despite these difficulties, Thurston Thompson succeeded in producing an impressive sequence of views, as well as a remarkable record of other objects previously noted by Robinson in various cathedral treasuries elsewhere in Spain. In addition to complementing the cast at South Kensington, the photographers were given an independent existence as a publication by the Arundel Society in 1868. This Society, which had been established to make known major works of art, had already published Thurston Thompson's photographs of the Raphael Cartoons. Unlike the cartoons, however, the portico had been virtually unknown until the 1860s and this volume, together with the cast and a book about Spanish medieval works by George Edmund Street (one of the Museum's advisors on acquisitions), secured it a prominent place within later histories of medieval art.\n\nLit.
