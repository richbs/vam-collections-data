            "physical_description": "Girl's Camp Fire ceremonial gown with headband, membership pin, ring, bracelet and necklace\n[Camp Fire gown] Girl's Camp Fire ceremonial gown, made to regulations laid down in the movement's hand-book, and stipulated to be worn over dark knickers (no petticoat), with moccasins or dark shoes and stockings on the feet.  The loose-fitting pull-on gown is of unlined khaki cotton drill, with side vents at the hem: the rounded neck, bound in brown cotton tape, has a slit front with the flaps turned back; the underarm seam of the short inset sleeves and the hem of the gown are edged with dark brown suede fringing (in the case of the hem, the bottom of the fringe to be worn seven inches from the ground).  The sleeves are also trimmed with a plain narrow band of dark brown suede around the edge; the skirt fringe has modern replacements of a narrow band of pale green braid decorated with moulded brown beads.  A triangular badge of cut and layered coloured felt is stitched to the breast of the gown, and represents the emblem of the camp to which the wearer belongs; a short string of yellow wooden beads hangs from its base, and another from the true right neck flap; long strings of coloured wooden beads on leather thongs or lengths of thread hang on either side of the camp badge.  Every piece of decoration on the gown is required to have meaning, and the coloured wooden beads are honours (the Camp Fire girl's equivalent of the Girl Guide's badges).  There are seven crafts for which honours are awarded for tasks performed or skills attained from the schedule, each with its own colour: orange (home craft), red (health), brown (camp craft), green (hand craft), blue (nature craft), yellow (business craft), red/white/blue (citizenship).  A string of ten purple beads was also awarded for each rank attained; and larger beads known as 'Big Honours' for achieving a group of honours in a particular craft.\n[Camp Fire headband] Camp Fire headband of woven glass beads with an ivory-coloured ribbon backing.  The narrow band is woven with a design of birch leaves in gold and silver on a clear background.\n[Camp Fire membership pin] Camp Fire membership pin of mild pressed steel enamelled in royal blue and silver with a pin and clasp fastening at the back.  The front is triangular with slightly curved sides: the royal blue border bears the three elements of the word 'Wohelo' in silver ('Wo' for work, 'he' for health and 'lo' for love, one of the key philosophies of the movement), with the letter W in royal blue on a silver ground in the centre.  To become a member, a girl had to be at least eleven years old and pass a short test.\n[Camp Fire Wood Gatherer's ring] Wood Gatherer's ring of sterling silver: the otherwise plain band is decorated with a bundle of seven silver faggots symbolising the seven points of the law (Seek beauty; Give service; Pursue knowledge; Be trustworthy; Hold on to health; Glorify work; Be happy) with three dots on either side to symbolise Work, Health and Love.  \nAlthough girls of eleven to thirteen years worked for the rank of Runner first, any girl joining at over thirteen could omit that stage and begin to work for the rank of Wood gatherer, as Sibyl Vincent seems to have done, passing all ten requirements listed in the hand book.\n[Camp Fire Fire Maker's bracelet] Fire Maker's bracelet of sterling silver.  The open-ended bracelet carries the word 'WOHELO' in Tsimshiam Indian lettering on a hammered ground.  Candidates for the rank of Fire Maker had to be at least fourteen, to have been a Wood Gatherer for at least a year, and to have passed the requirements listed in the hand book.  (The fourth and most senior rank was that of Torch Bearer).\n[Camp Fire necklace of honours] Necklace of coloured wooden honours beads threaded on a leather thong (used as an alternative to stringing them on the leather thongs attached to the gown): the honours are for business, home craft, hand craft, citizenship, and health, with two Big Honours for health at the centre front.",

            "public_access_description": "Luther H. and Charlotte V. Gulick started the Camp Fire youth movement for girls in 1910 in the United States. It encourages many of the same practical skills as the Guides movement in Britain, and tests its members in a similar way but within a quite different framework. Camp Fire was based on a romantic version of Native American culture, with each member making her own ceremonial costume based on the dress of the squaw, and choosing herself a new name for her identity within the group. \n\nCeremonial gowns such as this were made to regulations laid down in the movement\u2019s handbook, which stipulated that the dress must be worn over dark knickers (no petticoat), with moccasins or dark shoes and stockings on the feet. A triangular badge of cut and layered coloured felt was stitched to the breast of the gown, representing the emblem of the camp to which the wearer belonged. Every piece of decoration was required to have meaning, and the coloured wooden beads were honours, awarded for seven crafts: orange (home craft), red (health), brown (camp craft), green (hand craft), blue (nature craft), yellow (business craft), red/white/blue (citizenship). A string of ten purple beads was also awarded for each rank attained - Runner, Wood Gatherer, Fire Maker and Torch Bearer - and larger beads known as \u2018Big Honours\u2019 for achieving a group of honours in a particular craft.\n\nThe royal blue border of the Camp Fire membership pin bears the three elements of the word \u2018Wohelo\u2019 in silver: \u2018Wo\u2019 for work, \u2018he\u2019 for health and \u2018lo\u2019 for love, one of the key philosophies of the movement. The Wood Gatherer\u2019s ring is decorated with a bundle of seven silver faggots symbolising the seven points of the law: seek beauty; give service; pursue knowledge; be trustworthy; hold on to health; glorify work; be happy.",
