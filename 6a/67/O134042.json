Briefly at school in London, then Leeds Grammar School. Returned to London 1827 to study at Sass's art school and 1828 at RA Schools. Travelled to Paris 1832 and Italy 1833-5. Exhibited 134 works at the RA between 1833 and 1882, 14 at the BI 1836--43, and one at the SBA 1837. Nearly all his paintings were literary, biblical or historical subjects and domestic genre; the fact that he was Roman Catholic may explain his choice of many of the subjects. Founder member of the Etching Club in about 1840. Awarded one of the three first prizes in the 1843 competition for the new Palace of Westminster decorations with 'An Early Trial by Jury'; travelled again to Italy to study fresco painting before painting several frescos at Westminster. Elected ARA 1843, RA 1848; appointed Professor of Painting at the RA 1867, and examiner in painting for the South Kensington Schools of Art 1870. Visited America and Canada 1876. Died Bournemouth, Hampshire, 21 August 1890. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1869, ppl77-9; CH Cope <i>Reminiscences of Charles West Cope</i> RA 1891 (referred to below as <i>Reminiscences</i>)\n\n<b>Almsgiving</b> \nFA57 Neg HF3976 \nPanel, 69.9 x 45.7 cm (27\u00bd x 18 ins) \nSigned and dated 'C W Cope/1839' on bottom step br \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nPainted for John Sheepshanks, and exhibited at the RA in 1840 with the following quotation appended to the title in the catalogue: 'Reject not the affliction of the afflicted, neither turn away thy face from a poor man'. No source for the quotation is given, but it may be an adaptation from the Apocrypha, <i>Book of Ecclesiasticus</i> Chapter 4 verse 5: 'Turn not away thine eyes from the needy, and give him none occasion to curse thee'. \n\nIt is a pendant with 'Beneficence' (FA56, p47). The <i>Athenaeum</i> critic commented: \n\nStothard might have designed that delicate white-robed figure, with one babe in her arms, and another creeping close at her side ... The old head behind her is beautiful in its contrast - more than beautiful, even pleasing ... More than one technical defect might be charged upon this picture; but the feeling displayed in it must soften and elevate those who look on it; and in as much effect is wrought on the gazer, the artist's work is a good one, and his spirit worthy of all praise. The simple and holy affections are too rarely touched - how much more rarely expressed - by our painters! \n\nThe head of the woman giving alms and the pose of the male beggar may have been adapted from Raphael's famous cartoon for the Sistine tapestry, 'The Healing of the Lame Man at the Gates of the Temple', then in the Royal Collection (since 1865 on loan to the V&A).\n \nEXH: RA 1840 (204); <i>Artist at Work</i> Hampstead Arts Centre 1966 (47) \n\nLIT: <i>Athenaeum</i> 16 May 1840, p401; <i>Reminiscences</i> p377\"",
