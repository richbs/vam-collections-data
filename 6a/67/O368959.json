Each tenon pierced with two large peg holes and a smaller, countersunk hole in the centre that appear to have been added later as a fixing point for display. Both sides are cut at the front with a quarter-round moulding, and a continuous, square groove in which panels would have been held. The front surface, inset between squared edges is carved in low relief with a ribbon loop from which is suspended a plant (possibly the leaf and seed head of columbine - Aquilegia spp., or rosehip, or tulip), superimposed at the bottom over a raised band in a variant of Greek key pattern. The back is plain but for a lump of dried red paste or wax.",
