The bust was made six years after her accession to the throne by a German sculptor possibly known to her husband, Prince Albert (1819-1861). The exact circumstances for the commission are unknown.\n\nPeople\nThe sculptor of the bust, Johann Jacob Flatters (1786-1845), was born in the German city of Krefeld, but trained at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts (School of Fine Arts) in Paris, under the French artists Jean-Antoine Houdon (1741-1828) and Jacques-Louis David (1748-1825). He exhibited at the Salon in Paris from 1810 to 1839 and was created a member of the Legion of Honour. He settled in London in 1842 and exhibited at the Royal Academy there in that year. He was also known as a book illustrator.\n\nMaterials & Making\nMarble busts were among the most popular and prestigious types of public portrait in Britain during the Victorian period. The marble, a relatively expensive material, was imported, usually from Italy via the Netherlands, since there are no marble quarries in Britain. Aspiring artists might also learn the skill of carving marble abroad, where they would probably gain their most important training assisting an established sculptor.",
