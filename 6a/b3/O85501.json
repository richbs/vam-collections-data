ISBN 1851773088.\nA technical triumph and one of the most celebrated nineteenth-century photographs, this print of Silvy's River Scene was bequeathed to the Museum in 1868 by the Reverend C.H. Townshend along with a collection of paintings, prints and drawings, gems, intaglios and fine books. Townshend's bequest at a date when photography was not yet routinely collected by museums may point to the awareness among contemporary connoisseurs of photography of the V&A's early interest in this still relatively new medium. The history of Silvy's photograph also exemplifies how the medium was viewed in the 1850s. It was first shown at the annual exhibition of the Photographic Society of Scotland in December 1858, having been sent by the London photographic suppliers and dealers in photographs, Murray & Heath. Although it was one of more than a thousand exhibits, Silvy's landscape was frequently commended in the large press coverage of the exhibition. The Edinburgh Evening Consultant commented on 21 December 1858: \n\n\"We cannot pass this picture of a new artist without notice. The water, the foliage, the figures, the distance, the sky are all perfect. But above all, what some perfect photographs want, they are all beautiful. It is the most exquisite landscape we have seen in photography.\"\n\nAnother critic in the Daily Scotsman had written more cautiously three days earlier:\n\n\"If this photograph is untouched, and taken from nature, it is a triumph of the art, and equal to any picture of Van der Neer [the Dutch seventeenth-century landscape painter Aert van der Neer] or other delineator of similar scenery.\"\n\nSilvy's landscape met with further acclaim in London and Paris in 1859: it appeared as Vall\u00e9e de l'Huisine, in the first ever Salon treating photography as a fine art, held in Paris in the Spring of 1859. Silvy moved to England in the summer of 1859 to open London's first carte de visite studio.\nBecause of the extreme sensitivity of wet collodion-on-glass negatives to the blue parts of the spectrum, it was almost impossible to record cloud detail and the relatively darker landscape beneath on the same plate; Silvy, in fact, used separate negatives for the upper and lower parts of the composition, carefully printing them, consecutively on the same sheet of paper. He worked with fine brushes and inks too, in order to deceive the eye into reading the image as a seamless whole. He had, of course, positioned the people in the scene exactly as he wanted them - and is known to have drawn compositions in advance for some of his photographs. So cumbersome was the technique of photography in this period - requiring a portable darkroom in which large glass plates were sensitised on the spot and exposed, still moist, in the camera - that choice of subject was highly deliberate.\nOne of six known examples, this print was purchased (perhaps from Murray & Heath) by Townshend, who owned other remarkable photographs, notably seascapes and forest scenes by Silvy's contemporary Gustave Le Gray, and contemporary paintings by Th\u00e9odore Rousseau and others. He kept photographs in presses with his other fine prints, and the South Kensington officials who went through his collection after his death marked them for inclusion in the material to be accepted by the Museum.\n\nLit.Haworth-Booth, 1992\n\nMARK HAWORTH-BOOTH\nMark Haworth-Booth, <u>Camille Silvy.

London: The Victoria and Albert Museum in association with Hurtwood Press, 1983.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n<i>\n\"Camille Silvy   French   born 1835, active circa 1858-68\nRiver Scene, France   1858\nGold-toned albumen print from two wet collodion negatives\nSigned in red ink on the mount\n245 X 370 mm   Mus. no. 68,012   Bequeathed by Chauncey Hare Townshend</i>\n\nCamille Silvy's remarkable landscape has been heavily printed, to a level which in an ordinary photograph would have produced muddied tones.  Here the combination of lighting and subject has held the over-printing well, and the subsequent gold toning has added to the richness of the print.  The movement of ducks across the river suggests an exposure time of ten seconds or more.  This is one of the best documented, most aesthetically impressive and technically interesting of early photographs - and also most rare (only a somewhat faded copy in the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise de Photographie is known, apart from this mint example.  It was first exhibited at the Photographic Society of Scotland, Edinburgh, in 1858.  A critic wrote:\n\n'Perhaps the gem of the whole exhibition is 'River Scene - France' by C. Silvy.  We have seen no photograph which has taken our fancy so much as that exhibited under this unpretending title by Messrs Murray &amp; Heath [London photographers, suppliers, print publishers].  The natural beauty of the scene itself, rich in exquisite and varied detail, with the broad, soft shadows stealing over the whole, produce a picture which for calm, inviting beauty we have not seen equalled.  (<i>Journal of the Photographic Society</i>, 5 February 1859)'\n\nEarly negatives could not deal with the brightness range of a relatively bright (blue) sky and darker toned (green) earth.  Silvy combined separately exposed negatives - possibly made consecutively at the same scene - to make this print.  Like other photographers, he selectively masked and 'dodged' local areas (most noticeable round the rooftop at left) and 'burned in' the foreground to balance the sky.  The site is the river Huisne west of Chartres at Nogent-le-Rotrou.  The photograph was also shown at the Salon de Photographie of 1859 in Paris, an exhibition famous among other things for provoking Baudelaire's eloquent outburst against the art pretensions of photography which he linked to the claims of Naturalism. \n\n\n\nSimon Kelly and April M.
