Sk\u00e5ne province, in the extreme south of Sweden, has the richest tradition, and more jewellery was worn there than in any other district.   Almost all the Swedish traditional jewellery at the V&A comes from Sk\u00e5ne.  \n\nThe most popular necklace was a choker, made of several chains fastened at the front with a large decorative snap-clasp.  These clasps are often decorated with filigree and coloured pastes.  Swedish traditional jewellers made lavish use of coloured glass.  Red was the most popular colour, as everywhere in Europe, often mixed with green or blue.  The small loop on the lower edge would have held a small pendant heart.\n\nThe clasp on this necklace has a full set of Swedish silver marks.  It is marked with the Swedish 'cat's paw' standard mark, the town mark of Simrishamn, the date letter P4, for 1845, and the maker's mark AF.  Anders Flinkenberg was a silversmith who specialised in traditional jewellery, who worked in Simrishamn from 1820 to 1866.",
