A number of artists, such as Stephen Benwell, the ceramic artist, agreed to collaborate on the project. Several of them spent time at the Workshop as artists in residence. \nThis project differed from the usual large scale long-term work of the Workshop and provided individual, short-term and intimate challenges for the weavers.",

The majority of the Workshop's tapestries are large-scale commissions, for display in venues such as arts complexes, schools and universities, corporate foyers and boardrooms. Between 1983 and 1988 the Workshop collaborated with Australian artist Arthur Boyd to produce a monumental tapestry for permanent display in the new Parliament House n Canberra.  There has always been a demand from individual clients eager to own small examples of work and, in order to make their tapestries more widely available, the Workshop put together a collection of specially designed small tapestries to be woven in limited editions.  Designs were commissioned from a number of Australian artists, several of whom spent time with the weavers as artists in residence.",
