It has his portrait, at the age of 76, on the obverse and shows, in allegorical form, the various arts in which Bernini excelled: sculpture, architecture and painting. Bernini's experience of Louis' patronage, during his visit to France in 1665 had in fact been rather disappointing. His designs for the Louvre were never executed and his bust of the king had been unfavourably compared to Jean Warin's. This medal was made when Bernini was working on an equestrian statue of Louis XIV. When this arrived in France in 1685 the king disliked it so much that he had the head replaced and the statue banished to a distant part of the park at Versailles.",
