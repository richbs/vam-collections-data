The beads are all decorated on the front with applied filigree, and alternately with small pieces of turquoise.  The triangular terminal beads each have three pieces of turquoise.  Each of the rectangular beads has a loop on its lower edge from which hangs an open filigree pendant with hollow pendent balls.  These pendants vary in design and the number of pendent balls, but are arranged symmetrically.  Five are set with small pieces of turquoise.  There is a turquoise-coloured glass bead at the outside point of each of the terminal beads, attached to a short length of chain made from interlocking facetted silver beads.  The necklace is fastened by a simple hook and eye at the ends of the chain.",

It is called a labbeh, and was worn by both Jewish and Muslim women.  Like many pieces of Islamic jewellery it could be worn in various ways, and chokers like this were often worn across the forehead, or under the chin, hooked at each end into the head dress.",
