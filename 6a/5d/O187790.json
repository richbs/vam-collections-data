Italian goldsmiths were expert at making a little material go a very long way.  Many pieces seem too large to wear comfortably, but they are usually made of very thin gold, and are much lighter than they appear.  \n\nAll Italian women wore gold earrings.  Their shapes varied widely in different places.  This earring is typical of the Marches, in central Italy.  It is gold-plated, to look like real gold, and carries the silver mark of the Papal States.  It comes from the village of Sant\u2019Angelo in Vado.  This is the place where Castellani claimed to have found silversmiths still using the techniques of the ancient Etruscans.\n\nIt was bought as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
