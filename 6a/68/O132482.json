The front and side seat rails with low relief acanthus carving on the upper and outside surfaces, the rear rail carved only on top. The side stretchers, mid stretcher, and legs spiral turned with squared joint blocks, with floral decoration on the front legs (the front feet carved with three-toes), which terminate in a rounded boss (which would have served to locate a cushion).\nDark stain overall\nRepairs: added support blocks under all the seat corners, and four added corner braces below the seat; the rear seat rail rebuilt.

They were widely recorded in middle-class as well as noble house inventories well into the first half of the eighteenth century. Both the technique and the material (rattan cane or calamus rotang split into long narrow strips) came from Asia. The canes were imported in large quantities by the East India Company to London, where the production of caned furniture was concentrated. Caned chairs were also exported from London in large quantities, so much so that in France they were known as chaises d'anglaise, and in the German states as englische St\u00fchle. They were often used with a light seat cushion. Unlike upholstered chairs, caned chairs seem to have been produced through a subdivision of piece-work labour by journeymen joiners, turners, caners and carvers, who seem often to have stamped their work with initials, as on the right rear upright of this chair (the letters illegible).",
