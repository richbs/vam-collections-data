It is typical of Phyllis Ginger's topographical artwork; Ginger is best known for her topographical watercolour landscapes for the Pilgrim Trust's 'Recording Britain' project, begun in 1939 with the purpose of recording aspects of British landscape that might be destroyed and lost under enemy bombing. She was also given permission to sketch the bombed streets of London during the war and for the Schools Prints scheme, which commissioned well-known artists to create lithographs that could be reproduced and displayed in school classrooms, Ginger chose Bristol Town Centre as her subject, a lively street scene featuring numerous road vehicles.",
