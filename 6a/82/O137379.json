The top, formed by two plain boards (with canvas reinforcing underneath), overhangs the ends by 11cm and the front by 2cm (the back by 4cm), and is nailed to the rails and pegs into the stiles. The side rails are scratch-moulded, the rear rail is plain. (The rails are not deep enough to conceal the drawer.)\nThe sides of the drawer are dovetailed into the front, and the back is nailed (using hand-made) nails to the sides. Two wide bottom boards (the grain running side to side) are nailed up, and reinforced with canvas. The drawer is supported on both sides at a mid-height channel (both repaired) on battens suspended in notches cut into the inner corner of the stiles. On the drawer front (and on the adjacent faces of the front legs), pieces of moulding (9 missing, 2009) have been glued on to create the effect of two small drawers. The turned knobs appears to be relatively modern. \nOn the front of the table above and below the drawer, moulded fillets of wood have been nailed in place. Behind the lower fillet a batten has been tenoned into the front stiles, to the underside of which two sections of pierced scrollwork have been nailed/screwed.\nThe legs are turned, with blocks at the joints, and on pad feet. The front, mid and side stretchers are reel and bobbin turned, the rear stretcher plain.\nWith a heavy stain. Three of the feet worn.\n\nIt seems likely that a 17th century drawer, a different 17c table frame, and top boards (of uncertain date) were 'married' and 'improved' to form this table.",
