The fully assembled rings are shown in a row along the top of the page and the construction of each ring is explained in the drawings below. Some of the stones lock onto the ring and others are kept in place by hidden springs. The arrows help to explain this. The rings are shown from above and are turned towards the viewer. This offers the most three-dimensional viewpoint and reflects the way a ring is held in the hand as one examines it. The designer is Joel Degen, a self-taught jeweller who came to Britain from France in 1965. The use of fragile tracing paper and simple coloured crayon suggests that he made this drawing for his own reference.",
