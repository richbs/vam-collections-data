It was donated to the V&A through the Art Fund by the company J.P. Morgan, sponsors of the exhibition, and displayed at the Hayward Gallery as an example of the Art Fund\u2019s support of contemporary art.\n\nThe photograph depicts Sherman posing as a woman of the American Revolutionary period (1775\u201383) against a painted backdrop showing an agricultural scene. This major work by a leading contemporary artist plays with the visual codes of femininity and the relationship between photographic and painterly portraiture.",
