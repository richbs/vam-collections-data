A small bird sits  in each corner of the cross and the border is of reverse scallop holding circles with dots. The medallions on either side surround a human figure/warrior, with hand raised and a cloak, with floral icons in the background. These medallions also have a border of reverse scalloping holding circles with dots. These three medallions are connected by two, short lines of reverse scalloping holding circles with dots with a bird in the centre. Floral icons surrounding vases fill in space in the background around the short lines. One edge of the piece is selvedge of linen. At this edge the border is of reverse scalloping terminating with the rose/cross icon. [ie: an icon of four heart-shaped petals, with the pointed ends towards each other, separated with a short cross.] The piece is stained and with holes.\n\nA similar cross and birds icon is in a circle in the Hermitage, St Petersburg.",
