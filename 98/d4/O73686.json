In 1847 he was appointed Botanical Lecturer at the Government School of Design at Marlborough House in London. This was the ancestor of the Royal College of Art. Redgrave made these designs for Henry Cole\u2019s \u2018Summerly\u2019s Art Manufactures\u2019. The knife handles are based on subtle organic shapes worthy of a sculptor. They are asymmetric but provide a good grip, and are well proportioned. At the time they would have seemed completely modern. Redgrave wrote on the use of botanical forms in ornament and published books on the practice of design.",
