The daguerreotype was the first photographic process, publicised in January 1839. It was named after its inventor, Louis Daguerre. Just a few weeks later the first public demonstration of the daguerreotype in London was organised by a Monsieur de St Croix. This is therefore among the very first photographs taken in London. The scene is reversed \u2013 as is characteristic of the process \u2013 and the image on the shiny surface is difficult to read. However, once caught at the correct angle, amazing detail emerges. In the foreground there is a statue of Charles I and in the distance the royal Banqueting House. There are also traces of the people who stayed still long enough to register on the exposure, which probably lasted some minutes.",
