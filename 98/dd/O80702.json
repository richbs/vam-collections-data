The lot number, which is partially obscured by the paper backing-up of the picture, is <i>195</i>. Lots 171-197 of the sale at Messrs. Christie's on 17 February 1877 comprised \"Sketches by J. Constable R. A., the property of the Artist's Family\". Lot 195 'Valley of the Stour' was bought in for \u00a349. 7s. Holmes, p. 242, says that No. 63 [321-1888] is possibly the sketch which Constable is said to have made from the top of Langham Church tower but Lt.-Col. C. A. Brooks states that this is not so. He identifies the viewpoint as a cleft slightly to the west of Gun Hill about 600 yards to the east of Langham Church and close to that of No. 37. [124-1888]. The view was a favourite one with Constable. Davies, p. 33, in his note on N.G. No 1822 links that sketch with No. 63 and lists other variants of the view. Of these, the work he records from the J. P. Heseltine collection now belongs to Lt.-Col. C. A. Brooks; it was exhibited at Messrs. Leggatt's Summer Exhibition, 1956 (No. 43, and reproduction on p. 12 of the catalogue). \n\nHolmes dates No. 63 c. 1810. In view of the tentative nature of the drawing and technique this seems certainly too late. The dated oils of 1802 (Nos. 36, 37 and 39) [587-1888, 124-1888 and 142-1888] lay emphasis on the structure of the trees, a feature which is not apparent here. A dating nearer 1800 that 1805 is suggested by these considerations. The other versions discussed in this entry do not appear to be contemporary with No. 63. In 1964 the painting was lightly cleaned and revarnished. During this process certain darkened areas of old retouching were removed. These had been applied to cover small areas of paint loss where the red ground was exposed; these losses had apparently been caused by some form of impurity in the support, ground or adhesive used in laying the paper on canvas. The more disturbing areas of damage were retouched, and the painting now has a far more serene and homogeneous appearance, but this does not appear to call for a revision of the views expressed above about its date.'\nEvans, M., with N.
