There he studied classical Roman sculpture, as well as the work of Michelangelo and Bernini. He was famous for small-scale terracotta groups, often made for private collectors. \nClodion's broadly classical style is evident in this group of a nymph surrounded by four little cupids, one of which crowns her with a wreath of laurel. This group has echoes of Clodion's simpler terracottas of an adult carrying a child on a shoulder (examples are in the Fogg Museum, Massachusetts; and Ottawa National Gallery of Canada). Here he is more ambitious, including four small cupids in his composition. Putti and cupids feature in a large number of reliefs and other small-scale freestanding statuettes by Clodion and they are generally, as here, a subsidiary element alongside the main subject.",
