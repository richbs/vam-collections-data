Full Citation:\n\n\u201c<b>135 The Hon. Dudleya North</b>\n<b>c.1690</b> \nP41-1987 \n\n<b>Oval 75x 62 mm</b> \n\nFeatures softly hatched and stippled in brown and sanguine, with much shadowing in blue, with red for the lips, black in the eyes and white highlights; on a warm creamy carnation; hair in pale brown wash, hatched over in darker colour with highlighted curls in grey; dress in pale blue wash, modelled in darker colour with gummy black, especially for the jewel on which the lights are in white; chemise in pale brown wash, modelled in grey and white; the background in solid dark grey wash, hatched with grey gouache to right; on vellum put down on a leaf from a table-book. \n\n<b>Condition:</b> Water damage in lower margin, with quite extensive losses; some fading in the face, exaggerating the effect of the grey/white heightening, otherwise quite sound. \n\n<b>Signed:</b> Not signed. <b>Inscribed:</b> A silver-point mark on the back, presumably a <i>1</i> drawn as a narrow loop. \n\n<b>Frame:</b> As for Cat. No. 131 [ An oval frame, turned ebony of bolection moulding with additional grooves at the outer and inner edges;  the inner ring possibly made separately; the convex glass set in a rebate; a plain brass ring for the hanger, with  traces of original gilding, held by a pin driven through the wood at the top] ;the fruitwood backboard incised with various concentric ovals of different axes; inscribed on an old label attached to the paper covering of the backboard: Miss Dudley/North. \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> As for Cat. No. 131[Until 1690, Charles, 5th Baron North de Kirtling; until 1734, William, 6th Baron; his wife, Maria Margareta (born \u2018de  jonge van Ellemete\u2019). who married secondly in 1735 Patrick Murray, 5th Lord Elibank; his illegitimate son Patrick Murray of Simprim,  Forfarshire (d.c.1854); his daughter Maria Margaretta (d.1873) who married in 1842 James, Baron Talbot de Malahide; her eldest  daughter Susan-Ann, who married in 1864 Cecil St John Ives, subsequently Major-General; their second daughter Marion who  married her third husband in 1923, Godfrey Waiter, 2nd Baron Phillimore; she died in 1950; the miniatures sold to the Museum by  private treaty with two of her heirs, 1987].\n\nDudleya is said by Roger North to have been the youngest of the four surviving children of the 5th Baron North (see Cat. No. 131 [P.42-1987]). He continues, 'having emaciated herself with study, whereby she had made familiar to her, not only the Greek and Latin, but the Oriental languages, under the infliction of a sedentary distemper, died ... without issue. Her library, consisting of a choice collection of Oriental books, by the present Lord North and Grey [i.e., her elder brother William] was given to the parochial library at Rougham, in Norfolk, where it remains.' (1) \n\n1 North 1890, vol. I, p. vii .Jessop, ibid., vol. III, pp. 294-5 says that Dudleya was 'a year or two older than her elder brother' perhaps meaning 'the elder of her two brothers'. In light of the sitter's apparent age in this miniature, Dudleya may indeed have been the eldest of the surviving children, born therefore c.1676.\u201d",
