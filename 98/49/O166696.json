After a series of victories against the Austrian army in 1800, France forced the Holy Roman Empire to sign a truce at Lun\u00e9ville on 9 February 1801. As the Austrian ceased combat, Britain remained alone fighting France until the short-lived Peace of Amiens in March 1802.  The Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville was recorded in numerous designs by French, German, but also British medallists.\n\nPeter Kempson was a medallist in Birmingham at the latter end of the eighteenth century and the early nineteenth-century. There, in 1801, he entered into partnership with Samuel Kindon to run a die-sinking establishment, under the style of Kempson and Kindon. They employed the medallist and die-sinker John Gregory Hancock to cut \u201ca series of medals commemorating the Victories of the British armies over Napoleon, the Union with Ireland, George III, and Statesmen of the time\u2019. (Forrer, 1907, III,  141-143,161), While the Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville does not constitute a British victory, it illustrates the British interest for Napoleon\u2019s deeds on the continent, and shortly precedes Hancock\u2019s 1802 commemorative medal of the Peace of Amiens. He signed his medals HANCOCK, I.G.HANCOCK, and occasionally I.G.H. (as here) or H. (Forrer, 1904, II, 410-412).",
