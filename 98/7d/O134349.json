Studied next under George Clint ARA, specialising in theatrical portraiture. Fifteen of his works were engraved for publication in Cumberland's <i>British Drama</i> and exhibited later at the Colosseum in Regent's Park. Exhibited mainly humorous genre, literary and theatrical subjects (many of which were engraved); 25 at the RA between 1826 and 1855, 20 at the BI 1830-50, and 45 at the SBA 1827-59. Also exhibited five works in the competitions for the decoration of the new Palace of Westminster 1844 and 1845. His best known picture is 'Christmas in the Time of Queen Elizabeth' (exhibited SBA 1838); he also painted, probably about 1845, two large frescos at Wimpole Hall. He was equally well known for his book illustrations, beginning with his brief employment in 1836 on <i>Pickwick Papers</i>. He gave and published lectures in London and the provinces, edited <i>The Fine Art Almanac</i> (1850-2), and his <i>English Graphic Satire</i>, which he also illustrated, and which was privately printed 1874. Died Camden Town, London, 26 February 1875. His wife and daughter founded 1850 the North London Collegiate School for Ladies, where Buss also taught. \n\nLIT: <i>Athenaeum</i> 16 March 1875, p366 (obit); <i>Art Journal</i> 1875, pp178-9 (obit); G Everitt <i>English Caricaturists and Graphic Humourists of the Nineteenth Century</i> 1886, pp363-6; F G Kitton <i>Dickens and his Illustrators</i> 1899, pp47-57; G S Layard 'Our Graphic Humourists: Robert William Buss', <i>Magazine of Art</i> XXVI, 1902, pp361-4 \n\n<b>John Jackson the Wood-Engraver at Work (attributed to R W Buss)</b> \nE3100-1931 NegL1319 \nPanel, 31.1 x 36.2 cm (12\u00bc x 14\u00bc ins) \nPurchased 1931 \n\nJohn Jackson (1801-1848) was one of the earliest wood-engravers to illustrate popular books and magazines and he published a <i>Treatise on Wood-Engraving</i> in 1839. It was J ackson who suggested Buss to the publishers Chapman and Hall as the successor to Robert Seymour as illustrator of Charles Dickens's <i>Pickwick Papers</i> in 1936. J ackson also engraved on wood a design by Buss for Dickens's 'A Little Talk about Spring and the Sweeps', published in <i>The Library of Fiction</i> (1836); when the story was reprinted in <i>Sketches by Boz</i> in 1839 as 'The First of May', Buss's illustration was replaced by an etching by George Cruikshank. \n\nThe authorship and subject of this painting remain uncertain; the odd and carefully delineated perspective may be compared with that of Buss's late and unfinished picture of Dickens at work (present whereabouts unknown; repr in Kitton facing p52). It is interesting to note that the engraver is working at night, and the painting includes an engraver's light and globe.\"",
