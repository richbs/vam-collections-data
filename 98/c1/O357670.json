It also incorporates an embroidery style known as cutwork, where threads of the woven linen are cut and removed, and the remaining threads embroidered over to create open, lace-like patterns. \n\nWhitework and cutwork developed in Italy during the 16th century and became popular in the rest of Europe.  The Genoese style of the bobbin lace trimming the front edges of the coif and its slightly unusual shape suggest that it was made in Italy.\n\nIn Western Europe it was customary for both men and women to cover their heads in public up until the 1960s. A hat was an essential part of respectable dress and, from a health perspective, head coverings were considered necessary to protect against chills and disease.",
