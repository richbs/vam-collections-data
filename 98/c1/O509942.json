            "public_access_description": "Jean-D\u00e9mosth\u00e8ne Dugourc (Versailles, 23 September 1749 \u2013 Paris, 30 April 1825), was a talented and versatile designer. His father was the controller of the household of the Duc d\u2019Orleans, and Dugourc had the benefit of being educated as the companion of the Duc\u2019s son. He travelled to Italy in about 1764-65, where he met Johann Joachim Winckelmann, the famous scholar and enthusiast of the antique. He married the sister of the architect and landscape designer Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph B\u00e9langer in November 1776. His first recorded project, of 1770 was for the opera house at Versailles, and he received many commissions from court circles. His career had an international scope, with commissions for the courts of Spain, Sweden, England, Germany and Russia. He lived in Madrid from 1800 to 1814. His textile designs for Camille Pernon et cie. of Lyon are celebrated (see for example T.69-1951). His work confidently draws on a number of different styles.\n\nThis design is an elevation of one wall of an interior, with a bed or day-bed set in a niche, for a similar example see Museum no. 8459-1863 in the V&amp;A\u2019s collection. Beds such as this set in to a niche gave greater intimacy and privacy, as well as protection from draughts. The design includes decorative elements in the classical style, and the confident handling of decorative elements inspired by the antique is a feature of Dugourc\u2019s work. The subjects of the two roundels, showing scenes of figures in classical dress, have not yet been identified.",

The album has been associated with the Comte and Comtesse de Provence, but the evidence for this is not clear, as it is based on a now missing fly leaf inscription. According to Coutts the drawings by Dugourc in the album often have their dates erased, like this one. However, apparently the date shows as 1786 under infra-red light. As other designs in the album are dated 1790 it would appear that Dugourc reused older designs. Coutts points out that it seems incongruous that anybody in Paris would be commissioning luxury schemes like this the year after the French revolution. Dugourc made many designs for the Spanish court, beginning in 1786, so it is possible that this design relates to a Spanish commission.",
