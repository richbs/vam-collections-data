Ahrensmeyer, when he was performing at the Grand Theatre of Varieties, Hanley, during the week of 23 January 1904. He was billed as \u2018the American Cowboy Wonder Ahrensmeyer. The New Psychic Force. Stands Unrivalled and Alone. The Wizard of the Plains\u2019. It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre. He compiled them in a series of albums. \n\nAhrensmeyer was an expert self-publicist. He undertook stunts such as driving a horse and carriage blindfolded through towns where he was performing, including London and Hanley. His stage act included hypnotising audience members to make them do comical things, using bogus mediums to contact spirits, and passing ladies\u2019 hatpins through his cheeks, tongue and nose, or cutting his finger with a razor - all without drawing blood. Another of his tricks was to swallow a gold watch and chain and to invite an audience member to hear it ticking before returning it.",
