Mascots are used to communicate the Olympic spirit to the general public, especially youth and children. They are usually a character or animal native to the country where the games are being held and showcase the history and culture unique to the host city. In more recent years it has been common to have more than one mascot. This could be to ensure gender equity but has undoubtedly increased the merchandising potential of the Olympic mascot. \n\nQuatchi the Sasquatch is one of three mascots used at the 2010 Vancouver Olympic Games. A well-known figure of Aboriginal legend along the Pacific According to designers VANOC the Sasquatch \"reminds us of the mystery and wonder associated with the great Canadian wilderness\".  \n\nThe other two mascots are Miga the Seabear and Sumi a Chimera. The inspiration for all three was drawn from legends of First Nation Canadian Aborginal culture but other influences include the Olympic and Paralympic movements, modern animation styles and the culture and wildlife of British Columbia and Canada. The three mascots have been featured in a series of videos in which they are joined by a virtual friend called Mukmuk who is a rare marmot from the mountains of Vancouver Island.",
