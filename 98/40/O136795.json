            "public_access_description": "Geoffrey Beene Inc. opened in 1963, creating clothing renowned for its layered informality, clean lines and simple silhouettes. Beene became particularly famous for his highly constructed \u201carchitectural\u201d dresses but during the late 1960s he also turned to popular culture for inspiration, introducing touches of whimsy into his designs. His particular talent lay in creating clothing that successfully responded to the era in which it was worn - youthful styles in the 1960s and loose, fluid, body-freeing clothing in the 70s. Having achieved financial and artistic success by the end of the 1970s he finally had the creative freedom he desired and devoted the remainder of his career to the search for the perfect fabric, perfect seam and perfect cut. \n\nThe garments he showed in 1970 were a departure from the \u201carchitectural\u201d dresses he was known for in the previous decade. His new offerings were softly draped, unconstructed separates made of flowing fabrics that subtly revealed the body beneath. This red linen ensemble, given to the Museum by a former Geoffrey Beene model, is an example of this departure from the heavy brocaded fabrics of his earlier \u201carchitectural\u201d style.",
