Using the passion of the British for their gardens as a metaphor, the designers proposed prototype objects that examined the sense of alienation and frustration that lies beneath the surface of our personal relationships. Many of their solutions were witty and ironic, but the humour barely concealed a darker layer of anxiety. These prototypes are not intended to be mass-manufactured, but are intended to allow reflection on our relationships with objects, with nature and with each other. As such they show an interest in the conceptual content of designed objects that has inspired much innovation amongst contemporary designers.\n\nThis is called the Garden Horn, and the designers described as a device for speaking to plants that otherwise might be neglected. The Garden Horn could be used to whisper encouragement to a favourite plant. The talker will probably feel better, whatever effect it may (or may not) have on the plants.",
