This design is repeated 4 times in the central lozenge of the large octagon, again in metal thread and other silk thread. The metal thread also is found in the ground of the central area, which is decorated with a series of touching 8-pointed stars, as small isolated offset flowering stems.\nThe central area is framed with a wide composite band of large pulled thread hexagons, the remaining triangular spaces are filled with triangles of straight stitches, outlined as lozenges by metal thread.  A narrow band of small needlewoven lozenges edge this band on either side.\n\nCotton thread: Z-spun\nEmbroidery Thread: Silk; 2S: white, dark green, red, yellow, beige, blue, pink.\nMetal Thread: silver strip open S-wound on a cream, or faded yellow, silk core.  It is couched with yellow silk.",
