There are well over 50 different names for brooches in Norwegian, and each kind of brooch has its own distinctive name, some of which date back to the Middle Ages.  Ring brooches differ from modern brooches in the way they fasten.  The wearer pulls the cloth of the garment through the central hole, and then spears it with the pin.  The greater the strain on the pin, the more secure the fastening.  \n\nRing brooches were worn throughout Norway in the 18th and 19th century, by men, women, and children.  Although they often look very old, most only date from the last couple of hundred years.  This brooch was described as 15th century, when it was acquired in Molde in 1910, but it is more likely to be 19th century.",
