            "public_access_description": "The inro is a container made up of tiers. Japanese men used them because the traditional Japanese garment, the kimono, had no pockets. From the late 1500s onwards, Japanese men wore the inro suspended from their sash by a silk cord and a netsuke (toggle). They originally used it to hold their seal and ink or a supply of medicines. However, it rapidly became a costly fashion accessory of little or no practical use. \nThis inro is part of a unique set of 12 calendar inro by Shibata Zeshin, each representing a different month of the year. All 12 inro are of a different shape and size, while the decoration is carried out in different lacquer techniques. \nZeshin usually referred to a particular month by depicting some aspect of a popular or religious festival that took place at that time. This inro representing the twelfth month depicts Ebisu and Daikoku, two of the Seven Gods of Good Fortune. As the  patrons of merchants and commerce, they were though to ensure prosperity  and an abundance of food in the coming year. This inro, moreover, is in the form of a sheath inro. This type of inro separates into two pieces, an inner body and an outer sheath. This can be seen as representing the old and the new year. The outer sheath in this example is in the form of a window of a thatched dwelling. Through the window, the viewer can get a glimpse of the two gods, a clever device.                     From the 1700s onwards, many artists signed the inro they made. This example is by Shibata Zeshin (1807-91), one of the most talented and renowned lacquer artists of the 19th century. He was head of a successful workshop with an enormous output.",
