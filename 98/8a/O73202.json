The sides of the cabinet, the four sides of the stand and fronts of the shelf frames are carved with yanglian floral scrolling in red lacquer down to a buff yellow ground. The door and drawer fronts are carved in red lacquer down to a yellow diapered ground with scenes of cranes, deer, figures and flowering shrubs. \nThe upper surface of the stand (FE.56A) is decorated in incised and painted coloured lacquer with yanglian floral scrolling in a cartouche.\nThe interior surfaces of the cabinet are decorated in painted gold lacquer on a highly finished black ground, imitating Japanese lacquer, with floral sprays and elaborate scenes of pavilions in a landscape.\n(FE.56B) is an additional accompanying stand in carved wood painted black and gold. carved at the knees with lion masks and on the aprons with confronting dragons, it is probably contemporary but not necessarily originally associated with the cabinet.",
