He lived at the monastery at the Great St Bernard Pass (a pass connecting Martigny in Switzerland to Aosta in Italy). He earned worldwide fame for his rescue operations and is credited with saving between 40 and 100 lives in his lifetime. There is a monument to Barry in the Cimeti\u00e8re des Chiens, and his body was preserved and put on display in the Natural History Museum in Berne. \n\nHis body has been on display at the Natural History Museum since 1815. The original taxidermist gave Barry a rather humble and meek pose as the Prior wanted him to serve as a reminder of constant servitude to future generations. In 1923 he was refurbished by the taxidermist, Georg Ruprecht who gave him a more alert and dynamic pose, with his head raised. Ruprecht also altered what would have been Barry\u2019s natural appearance to represent that which was popular at the time, by modelling a larger head with a more pronounced stop. \n\nHis markings are very similar to those on a painting by Salvator Rosa, in The Great St Bernard Hospice in Switzerland.\n\nThis print depicts Barry in his original 1815 taxidermy appearance.\n\nThe above written with reference to the official website for Naturhistorisches Museum Der Burgeremeinde Bern: \nhttp://www.nmbe.ch/deutsch/531_5_1_9.html \nAccessed: 16/07/2010",
