Maltese crosses were most common in the west of France, and particularly among the Huguenots, as a result of which they were often called Croix huguenotes.  \n\nThis Maltese cross comes from Arles, in Provence.  It may have been worn round the neck, on a black velvet ribbon, as was common throughout France, but it may also have been worn at the wrist on a gold bangle, called a coulas, which was only worn in that district.  It was described as \u201ccalled \u2018des damiseloto\u2019 and worn on the wrist\u201d when it was acquired for the Museum at Avignon in 1872.",
