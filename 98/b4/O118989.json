The 19th century saw a craze for ceramic figurines of performers. Agatha Walker attempted to revive this tradition with her limited edition sculptures, modelled from life in plaster and coated with a fine layer of wax which was then coloured.  In 1931 Agatha Walker's wax figures were exhibited at the Fine Art Society.\n\nThis represents the actress and singer Beryl Freeman as Diana Trapes in John Gay's The Beggar's Opera which opened at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith on 5th June 1920. It was one of a set of characters from this opera produced by Agatha Walker in 1921. This revival of the18th century operetta ran for 1463 performances and was a great success for the theatre's owner Sir Nigel Playfair who had purchased the lease of the derelict theatre building in 1918 in a syndicate.  He transformed it into a highly successful venue, putting Hammersmith firmly on the theatrical map.",
