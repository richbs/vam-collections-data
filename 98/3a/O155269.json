There is a border along the bottom: a pink flower alternating with a blue flower edged with 4 small flowers, both motifs facing to the lower right.  Edged on four sides with a dark green embroidered line which extends a little way up either side of the panel.\n\nThe main pattern is a series of diagonal lines from lower right to upper left.  These are chevron lines in green and dark green.\nThere are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: small motifs; pale pointed flower outlined in yellow with dark blue centre and pink details points either to the right or straight down and alternates with a mauve and blue 5-petalled flower pointing either to top right or bottom left.\n[2] wider stripes in two designs: [a] white ground with 4 designs in diamond-shaped sections: [1] vertical stem pointing to the right with a pair of black outlined blue flowers and 2 small yellow outlined mauve flowers; [2] an angled chevron stem with downward pointing pink and yellow pointed flowers outlined with light blue; [3] downward pointing straight stem with variation of [1]; [4] variation of [2] pointing to the right.  In each diamond section larger flowers form the diamond shape.\n[b] white ground with 2 designs in diamond sections, both have small yellow vases and floral arrangements pointing downwards: one stem has a green-edged pink carnation and one has a pink trefoil flower edged in mauve; both designs include many other blossoms.\n\nThreads: silk; 2S; red, mauve, light blue, dark blue, white, yellow, green, dark green, very dark green, pink, light pink.",
