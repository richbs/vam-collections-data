            "history_note": "Historical Significance:\n\nEnglish painter and draughtsman. He received his early education from his father, Thomas Malton the elder (1726-1801), who was a cabinet-maker, perspective lecturer and architectural draughtsman. He entered the Royal Academy in 1773. He exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1773 and 1803, showing mainly accurate architectural views. He also painted scenery for Covent Garden Theatre, London. From 1783 he practiced as a drawing master, specialising in perspective. The young J. M. W. Turner was amongst his pupils. His series of views titled <i>A Picturesque Tour through the Cities of London and Westminster</i> was published in 1792. This was followed by <i>Picturesque Views of the City fo Oxford</i> in 1802. Such publications respond to the contemporary popularity for engraved topographical views. \n\nThe precise architectural observation in this view of Bath reflects Malton\u2019s training and is typical of the topographical watercolours that he produced. The gothic form of the Abbey on the right of the composition contrasts with the clean Neoclassical lines of the buildings in the foreground. Malton was particularly interested in changing fashions and often represents examples of recent architecture such as that which was then being built in Bath. With the growing popularity of springs as a form of treatment, Bath had become a fashionable destination for eighteenth-century society. This view is framed on the left by North Parade, a terrace built to the designs of John Wood the Elder (1704-1754) in 1741. At a time of architectural redevelopment in Bath, North Parade was designed to be part of a series of buildings in South Parade, Pierrepoint and Dukes Streets, intended to become the Royal Formum. This project was never realised.\n\nMalton has unsuccessfully used the lines of architecture to create a vanishing point in the perspective, just behind the man in the centre foreground. The view is presented under a blue sky with clouds on the right helping to frame the view whilst emphasising the wide expanse in front of North Parade.  Fashionably dressed figures populate the foreground, conveying the popularity of Bath as a destination for society.\n\nThis is one of a number of watercolour drawings made by Malton during a visit to Bath in 1777  (examples also at the Victoria Art Gallery, Bath and the Victoria & Albert Museum, London, inventory number 1723-1871). In 1780 Malton is recorded exhibiting seven views of Bath at the Royal Academy (nos. 397, 399, 413, 441, 442, 449, and 450). It is possible that this is one of the watercolours shown that year at the Royal Academy. An acqauatint after this watercolour was published by Thomas Malton and J. Ganton in 1779. This shows Malton responding to the growing demand for topographical views of popular destinations such as Bath.",
