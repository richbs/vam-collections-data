This sits rather clumsily on the top of the neck at the start of the curved handle which rejoins the body on the lower shoulder.  On the opposite side the mended spout is luted to the body.  A very long flaming leaf decorates its underside.  The main neck broadens towards the shoulder with a pattern of two birds amidst untidy leaves and a final continuous design of six open lappets.  Only three long vertical bands imitating parts of a tree trunk aspire to frame the root compositions of the main body.  A balanced composition has been achieved to the right of the handle with a central root system framed by two balustrades, one with a finial and a bird, the other with two barren trees on its outer side.  Below, two clusters of cactus leaves and hairy leaves emerge from a balustrade with roots.  These features are repeated on the other side and below the spout and handle in an untidy manner.  A band of thireteen reserve-painted lotus panels leads to the splayed foot and a further band of speudo-writing which has also been painted on the flange of the small vase.",
