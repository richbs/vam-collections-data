To create such a composition an artist would work through the seasons to build up a collection of drawings and watercolour studies, such as this, to work from. We know that it was a widespread practice for artists to work from their own 'library' of sketches because it is sometime possible to identify a sketch with the same specimen in a finished oil painting or to find the same flower repeated in different paintings. \n\nThis study of striped tulips is botanically accurate, but is clearly intended for a decorative rather than a scientific purpose. The tulip was a fashionable and popular flower in the 17th century, and striped specimens were highly valued. This study may well have been painted in England. Verelst was born in the Hague in 1644, but he came to London in 1669 and stayed until his death in 1721. At the height of his career he had a number of important patrons among the English aristocracy, and King Charles II bought several of his paintings.",
