Ada Lacey and her husband owned a shop in Clapham, South London during the early decades of the twentieth century, which possibly supplied the vast range of material. The individual silks have been pieced together in a design known as framed or medallion patchwork, and embellished with embroidery stitches. Printed pictorial cigarette silks were issued by British cigarette manufacturers between 1911 and 1935, and were produced to help promote the sale of tobacco. Cigarette silks were intended as collectables and were printed with images of flowers and portraits of famous people, including royalty and sports personalities.  The printed panel at the centre of this coverlet features an image of the Queen of Romania (Marie Alexandra Victoria, previously Princess Marie of Edinburgh). The surrounding frames include images of flags, ceramics, regimental insignias and well known portraits by famous artists.",
