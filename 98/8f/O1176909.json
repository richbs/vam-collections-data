Aylieff was awarded a sabbatical from the Royal College of Art to allow her to take up the residency, with the stipulation that she should publish her research and that the ceramics she produced should be brought back to Britain and exhibited. A proposal to exhibit the works in the Lobby of One Canada Square, Canary Wharf as part of the Sculpture in the Workplace programme was accepted, and the resulting exhibition, Out of China: Monumental Porcelain by Felicity Aylieff, subsequently toured a number of UK venues.\n\nWriting of the painting of the pot in the publication that accompanied the exhibition, Felicity Aylieff states:\n\n'I chose a large Chinese brush traditionally used for calligraphy to make the marks that chase across the surface of this pot. Unlike western brushes the head is round and fat and the hog hair bristles long and tapered to a fine point. The pot surface is very absorbent at the painting stage, and I had to work fast to keep a fluid line. The spring in the brush lent itself well to the energetic 'dance' across the surface.'\n\nA companion to this pot, 'Chasing Red', was also produced by Aylieff, this additionally featuring paintwork in red enamel.",
