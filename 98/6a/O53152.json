This sort of decoration became a speciality of the town of Nancy, in Lorraine, France, in the late 17th century, in response to a series of laws that made it illegal to manufacture such small luxury items from precious metals. \n\nThe laws had been passed after a succession of expensive foreign wars, when Louis XIV, the King of France, found that his reserves of gold and silver were severely depleted. The carvers of Nancy in Eastern France saw their chance and made a great success of their highly decorative boxes, mirrors and other small objects carved from a very fine grained cherry wood known as bois de Sainte-Lucie. Both the forms and the decoration of these objects were based on contemporary silverware.  The trade continued until at least the 1740s.",
