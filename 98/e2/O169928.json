However, after the destabilising activities of the Vira Raja, the EIC intervened and the state was formally annexed in 1834. Susequent issues over the introduction of monetary taxation seemed to have been behind a rising by the Gauda people in Kanara, a province of Kodagu. Due to the loyalty of the Kodavas to British rule, the rising met with little success. This loyalty was immediately rewarded by the issuing of this medal to the loyal people of the Kanara area. Approximately 250 were struck but the medals issued were unnamed, so the identity of the recipients are unknown. An original medal is in the collection of the Fitzwilliam Museum.",
