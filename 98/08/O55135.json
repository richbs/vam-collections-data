Many different meanings. Yet all united / by structure and simplicity. The straight and the / curved. Thecross and the circle. Elementally geometric. / Symbolically pure . You'll find your own examples / in the most unexpected places. When you do, think of / each one as a greeting from us . February 7th 1997\n People born / in the year of / the Ox tend / like their animal sign, to / be placid and / easy-going. / They are also\n self-assured / which often / leads to them / being highly / successful / people who / have the / ability to\n inspire others. / Their slightly / cool attitude / and / unemotional / responses can / result in / them being\n misunderstood, / particularly / within family / relationships. / And these / tensions are not / helped by their / ability to anger\n easily and / to be petty / and mean. / Although quiet / by nature / they can speak / in public / with great\n eloquence, / authority and / sincerity. / They are also / extaordinarily / good with their hands. / The Chinese\n horoscope / signs represent / the universe / itself and are / either Yin or / Yang.

The company creates corporate identities, brochures and a variety of other materials including posters, conference and exhibition packages, signage, invitations and tickets - as well as specialising in typography. \n\nEvery year since 1988 Lawrence Cheung has produced a limited edition Chinese New Year's greeting for its clients and friends.\n\nAs well as conveying a New Years greeting, this short booklet is also celebrating the tenth anniversary of Lawrence Cheung Limited. Because of this, the relationship between noughts (zeros) and crosses (the Roman numeral for ten) is a theme running throughout. This card uses examples that can be found in everyday life: a steering wheel, a hot cross bun or a compact disc to exemplify \"this pleasingly harmonious coalition of ruler and compass\". \n\nThe Chinese animal signs are a 12-year cycle used for dating the years. They represent a cyclical concept of time, rather than the Western linear concept. The Chinese Lunar Calendar is based on the cycles of the moon and is constructed differently to the Western solar calendar. In the Chinese calendar, the beginning of the year falls somewhere between late January and early February. The Chinese have adopted the Western calendar since 1911, but the lunar calendar is still used for festive occasions such as the Chinese New Year.",
