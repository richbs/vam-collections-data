The Old Testament prophet Isaiah prophesied that the Messiah would come from the House of David and wrote (11:1-3):\n       A shoot shall come out from the stump of Jesse and a branch shall grow out of his    roots. \n\nJesse Trees were common in 12th and 13th century medieval art. They are intended to show the geneology of Jesus Christ which is described in the Gospel of St. Matthew.\n\nMost Jesse Trees have a reclining figure of Jesse at the bottom with a vine or tree growing up from him. The branches of the tree hold, in the centre, kings from the line of David. Flanking these kings are figures of prophets who foretold the coming of Christ and proclaimed his ancestry.\n\nRecent research has suggested that this panel and another one in the V&A (C.125-1929) came from a Jesse Tree window in Soissons Cathedral in France. \n\nSoissons Cathedral and many of its windows were greatly damaged in the 16th and 19th centuries. Some of the damaged glass had been replaced with glass from another church and extensive restoration work has confused the original iconography.",

            "history_note": "According to Caviness, this panel , C.125-1929 and one in Worcester Art Museum, Massachusetts, USA are all that survive from a Jesse Tree window. Their style is similar to those at the Sainte-Chapelle.\n\nShe believes they came from Soissons because the figures are similar in style to figures from some Soissons panels which no longer survive and are only known from photographs. We don't know if Soissons even had a Jesse window but it is likely that they did.\n\nLouis Grodecki believed that artists from Sainte-Chapelle worked at Soissons because there are similarities in the painting style of the faces and hair. \n\nSoissons Cathedral was heavily damaged in a Huguenot attack in 1567. \nIn 1815 two powder magazines exploded near the cathedral and destroyed nearly all the windows in the nave and damaged some in the ambulatory. \nThis glass was replaced with some from the abbey church of St. Yved in Braine.\nIn the 1860s major restoration work was undertaken. \nIn the 1880s the glass was removed and much glass was dispersed before WWI. \n\nThe surviving windows suffered extensivc restorations that have altered original settings and compositions. Whole windows were transferred from their original locations.",

            "historical_context_note": "This panel most likely depicts a prophet which would originally have formed part of a large Jesse Tree window.\n\nJesse was the father of King David. The Old Testament prophet Isaiah prophesied that the Messiah would come from the House of David and wrote (11:1-3):\n       A shoot shall come out from the stump of Jesse and a branch shall grow out of his    roots. \n\nJesse Trees were common in 12th and 13th century medieval art. They are intended to show the geneology of Jesus Christ which is described in the Gospel of St. Matthew.\n\nMost Jesse Trees have a reclining figure of Jesse at the bottom with a vine or tree growing up from him. The branches of the tree hold, in the centre, kings from the line of David. Flanking these kings are figures of prophets who foretold the coming of Christ and proclaimed his ancestry.\n\nRecent research has suggested that this panel and another one in the V&A (C.125-1929) came from a Jesse Tree window in Soissons Cathedral in France. \n\nSoissons Cathedral and many of its windows were greatly damaged in the 16th and 19th centuries. Some of the damaged glass had been replaced with glass from another church and extensive restoration work has confused the original iconography.",
