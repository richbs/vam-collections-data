Along the left-hand of the two folds is a line of holes which may be sewing marks: these are 262 mm. from the right-hand edge, the same distance as the corresponding marks on No. 273 [Museum No. 605-1888]. This and the discoloration of the right-hand side suggest that the sheet may have come from the sketch-book discussed in the note following No. 262, to which No. 273-276 have been related. The style of drawing, and the method by which the outlines of the clouds are drawn with the point of the brush, show that the drawing was in any event made at about the same time as Nos. 275 and 276 (Museum No.  and 276). The subject is therefore likely to be near Brighton.  \n\nGraham Reynolds.",
