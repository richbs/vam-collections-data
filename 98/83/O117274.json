His sketch specified a light but strong chair, to be covered in green leather, with brass nails. Green was the colour of the House of Commons. The chair became the standard pattern for lobbies, refreshment rooms, libraries and offices. A different version was produced for the House of Lords, upholstered in red. By 1870 the chair was also used in other public buildings, including the South Kensington Museum, now the Victoria and Albert, where the Boardroom was furnished with a large set, including this example, which was recovered to Pugin's original specification in 1974.\n\nGillow & Co. were commissioned to make furniture for the House of Commons from 1851. Their stamp is on the underside of the seat frame of this chair, suggesting that they made examples of Pugin's design for other commissions.",
