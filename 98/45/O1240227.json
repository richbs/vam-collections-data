The majority of the figures were  manufactured by O. M. Hausser, a leading German manufacturer of toy soldiers, but the set also includes at least one figure produced by A. G. Lineol,  Hausser's main competitor. All of the  figures were manufactured in Germany in the mid- 1930s. \n\n\tThey are made from a composite material, which includes substances such as plaster, glue, sawdust and  linseed oil mixed together, which is then  pressed into a mould around a wire armature,  heated and dried and then hand-painted. The  particular composite mixture used by Hausser was given the trade name 'Elsastolin'. \n\n\tThis set reflects the trend amongst toy manufacturers  to mirror the real world in terms of new armies,  regiments, changes in uniform and equipment and  methods of warfare. The fact that the injured troops are German and were manufactured by a German company indicates that this trend towards realistic depiction can include the more disturbing aspects of war, and can show loss as well as victory.",
