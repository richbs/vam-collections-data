Wright believed that it was impossible to detach a building from its furnishings and so designed the office furniture to echo the design of the company's headquarters. The circular form of the chair was created to reflect the treatment of the supportive columns in the main area of the building, the Great Workroom.  \n\nThe chair is made from cast-aluminium piping, rather than from the tubular steel that was  used extensively by designers such as Marcel Breuer and Mies van der Rohe.\n\nThe upholstery on the furniture within the building was colour coded to distinguish different operations within the company. The Cherokee red seat on this chair indicates that it was used in the credit department. Green was used for the billing department, blue for the records department, and beige for the sales department.  \n\nThe chair has only three legs and was designed to promote good posture in the sitter.  If the sitter adopted any other position rather than one with two feet on the ground with weight evenly distributed, the chair would become unstable.",
