The container consisting of two pairs of layers, the inner pair sandwiching buff linen canvas, and the outer layer of the outer pair wrought decoratively.  The container lined with soft brown leather, largely extant.  The cap consisting of one pair of layers, the outer decoratively wrought, and never lined.  The brown colour of the thrust probably representing the original colour of the exterior, now sable.\n\nForm shaped for the contents, and consisting, in front, of a disc above a shaft, and, at rear, of four leaf vertical tubes.  On the container, two pairs of eyes (one pair behind the disc), corresponding with one pair on the rear of the cap, for a flat thong long wanting.\n\nDecoration of the front in smooth, very slight, relief, against a stippled ground of small rouletted [in a mathematical curve] rectangles.  Vertical scheme.  In the middle, below a growing tree (cap), a wavy leafy stem.  On the left and right flanks, symmetrically, below leafy panels, larger panels of scrolled leafy stems.\n\nOn the ends, tulip pattern and oak-leaf pattern.  On the back rear correspondingly with the four tubes, a vertical scheme of four elongated oak-leaves.\n\nOn the base of the rear, the facade of a brick-built church, and above the portal a pediment containing a cross and flanked by crosses.\n\nOn the cap front and rear and front panels the legend in smooth Gothic letter against a stippled ground (as front) : SAGRESTIA// DI VOLTERRA\n\nUnderside plain\n\nFLORENTINE;\n\nHeight: 1 foot 8 \u00bd inches (42 cm)\nWidth: 9 inches (23cm)\nDepth: 5 inches (13 cm)\n\nNo corresponding crozier known.  Base of right-hand tube long wanting.  Warn and slightly torn.  Some warping of the fit.\n\nNot previously published.  Shown features offer no certain identification with the Cathedral or other churches at Volterra.\n\nMarked resemblance in style with the case (A.547A-1910_), for the crozier (A.547-1910), bearing the arms of Aldofrandini referred beyond doubt to Benci II Aldobrandini of Florence, was made Bishop of Gabbio by Urban V (Pope) and died in retirement at Florence in 1375.  Quality not so high.",
