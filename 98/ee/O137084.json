The artist has injected a personal flavour and a sense of fun in the asymmetry of the blade and the truncated slanted front edge. The pleasing curves of the blade are continued through the daringly steep bolster-apron lift, highly polished to give a variety of textures. The concave curved handle balances the trowel-shaped blade and has a roller-imprinted cloth pattern. The functional aspect of this solid piece is clear through the tactile texturing of the handle with a polished multiple-finger grip on the underside and the generous size of the blade. The frank structural design is complemented by the light-hearted scene, man eating fish, a very literal interpretation of the fish server's use.",
