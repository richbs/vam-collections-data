            "public_access_description": "Edward Dayes (1763-1804) was one of the most respected watercolourists of the 18th century. He taught the artist Thomas Girtin (1775-1802) and also influenced Joseph Mallord William Turner (1775-1851).\n\nHis watercolour technique was typical of the later 18th century. After making a careful outline drawing in pen and ink, he would apply grey-blue washes with his brush. He would then use the colours to finish the painting. Here Dayes shows a magnificent building that is upstaged by the figures in front of it. In this he was challenging such artists as Thomas Rowlandson (1756-1827).\n\nThe architect John Nash (1752-1835) altered and enlarged Buckingham House in the mid 1820s for George IV. It then became known as Buckingham Palace.",

Hardie, <i>Water-colour painting in Britain ... 1967-72</i>, I, pl.194\n\nGodwin made studies from this water-colour in 1882. Some fifty years later it was featured in the Museum as the 'Masterpiece of the week'. The beautifully presented label said of it 'There was a vogue in the latter half of the 18th century for engravings showing groups of well-dressed people at fashionable places of resort. Debucourt, Desrais and Gabriel de St Aubin made drawings for prints of this kind in France: Rowlandson, Bunbury and Dayes designed their English counterpart ... From the technical aspect, this is a fine example of the so-called 'stained' or 'tinted' drawing which was in vogue at the end of the 18th century. The subject was drawn in pen outline: all the shadow effect next added with a monochrome wash, in this case a mixture of indigo and Indian ink; then the colour was washed over the monochrome under-painting'.\n\nThe Museum possesses over 60 sketch-books by Godwin, spanning the whole of his career. Although primarily an architect, his interests spread to almost every area of design. The sketch-books are filled with drawn and written notes of things seen and for projects in hand. \n\nThat these sketches were made as an aid to inspiration rather than to provide patterns to follow is made clear by his statement in the sales catalogue of <i>Art Furniture by Edward W. Godwin, F.S.A. and manufactured by William Watt</i>, 1877 p.VIII that 'It is easy enough to make furniture in <i>direct imitation</i> of any particular style, especially the old English styles, with such Museums as that at Kensington open to us. What I have endeavoured to secure in design, has rather been a modern treatment of certain well-known and admired styles than a reproduction of old forms.'\n\nThe costume studies from Dayes's watercolour were made in the year Godwin was elected the Honorary Secretary of the Costume Society. Dudley Harbron, his biographer, stated that even in his teens he had drawn constantly from J.R. Planch\u00e9's <i>History of British costume from the earliest period to the close of the 18th century</i>, 1834, and that he saw this appointment as an opportunity 'to prepare a series of plates to fill a portfolio consisting of forty drawings of historic costume each year. At long last he was able to become his own Planch\u00e9.<sup>12</sup> In fact these plates do not appear to have materialized. He did however publish, <i>Dress, and its relation to health and climate</i> for the International Health Exhibition in 1884. He was also taken on by Liberty's, as the catalogue <i>'Liberty' developments in form and colour</i> issued in 1890 stated, 'to re-establish the craft of dressmaking upon some hygienic, intelligible and progressive basis; to initiate a renaissance that should commend itself artistically to leaders of art and fashion, and to challenge on its merits the heretofore all-powerful and autocratic fiat of Paris for 'change' and 'novelty' so far as it was oblivious of grace and fitness.' One of the sketch-books in the collection includes a study of a fashion parade at Liberty's.\n\nSL\n\n<sup>12 D.Harbron, The conscious stone, the life of Edward William Godwin, 1949, p.161.</sup>'\n\n",
