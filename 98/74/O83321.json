The print works were established by William Smith in the 1820s in Langley, a tiny hamlet two miles from the town of Macclesfield, Cheshire.\n\nThese blocks were made up of several layers of wood with the grain running in alternate directions to prevent warping. The printing surface is usually of lime or pear wood. The pattern is made by cutting away areas of wood or by adding metal pins to produce the design in relief. Brass pins are put into the corners to help align the pattern. Five or more blocks are usually needed to make a design complete.",
