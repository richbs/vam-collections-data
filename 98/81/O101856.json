It represents scenes from the biblical story of the Dream of Pharaoh and leads us to believe that prints like this of characters from biblical stories were the basis for an early form of German Toy Theatre.\n\nFrom the way the characters are portrayed it appears that this sheet was meant to be cut up and used in performance in conjunction with a text. It is unlikely that the images on this sheet were meant for one static three-dimensional image or 'Nativity', but rather for performance.",
