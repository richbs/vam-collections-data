But its properties had not been fully exploited, in particular those of refraction and reflection. The maker of this object attempted to harness the beauty of the heavy lustrous lead glass to flickering candlelight, but without enhancing the quality of the light by cutting. Another indication of its early date is the fact that the arms were joined to the body while the glass was hot, so that the necessary thickness of the arms had to be balanced against the extra weight. Fragments of similar table chandeliers have been found; surprisingly, the only damage to this example was caused by the candles burning too low in their glass sconces.\n\nTime\nIn the early 18th century German glass cutters settled in London and specialized in the cutting of very expensive mirrors. Eventually they also applied their skills to dessert glasses as well as light fittings. As early as 1714 a London glass dealer, John Gumley near the Strand, was advertising 'Glass Schandelers'.",
