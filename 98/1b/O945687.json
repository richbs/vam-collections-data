Carboni or ? Carloni) Pen and ink and wash, heightened with white, on grey-green paper 2 7/8 x 10 3/4 (73 x 273) D.110 -1885 PROVENANCE Sir T. Lawrence (Lugt 2445: the stamp is on D.110 only); bought 1885 LITERATURE A. E. Popham, 'The drawings of Girolamo Bedoli' in <i>Master Drawings</i>, 2, 1964, p. 263, nos. 9 and 10 Formerly ascribed to Pordenone. The attribution to Bedoli was proposed by Pouncey and is confirmed by Popham (<i>loc. cit.</i>), who suggests that the friezes were designed for the decoration of an Episcopal or monastic library, possibly that of S. Giovanni Evangelista at Parma, where Bedoli was much employed.",
