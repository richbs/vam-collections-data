Such a precise dating emphasises how Constable's drawings were a kind of visual diary. This drawing was done on the artist's first visit to Salisbury. It was the source for the well-known painting Salisbury Cathedral from the Bishop's Grounds of 1832, which is also in the V&A\u2019s collection. Constable often referred back to earlier drawings in his paintings in this way. The finished painting, though, was not always an exact transcription of the drawing.",

            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, pp. 69, 72-74\nThe following is an extract from the text of the entry:\n\n\"Although the relation of this drawing to the preliminary stages of the oil painting 'Salisbury Cathedral from the Bishop's Grounds' (No. 254 [F.A.33]) had naturally led to its being dated <i>c.</i>1820-3, for example by John Steegman in the <i>Art Quarterly</i>, Detroit, Vol. XIV, 1951, pp. 195-205, its recent removal from the card on which it had been laid down has revealed that it was, together with Nos. 106-108 [825-1888, 832-1888, 614-1888], a product of Constable's first visit to Salisbury.  Nevertheless it was to this drawing that Constable turned when Bishop Fisher gave him the commission to make the large oil painting of the Cathedral which was exhibited in 1823 (No. 254[F.A.33]).\n\nNotes on Nos. 105-108 [292-1888, 825-1888, 832-1888, 614-1888]\n\nNos. 105 [292-1888] and 106 [825-1888] were made during Constable\u2019s first visit to Salisbury, and Nos. 107 [832-1888] and 108 [614-1888] are so similar in technique, size and subject-matter that they were almost certainly drawn at the same time.  The zig-zag diagonal scribble which represents foliage is characteristic of Constable\u2019s pencil drawings at this period (see No. 114 [842-1888]).  On this visit Constable was the guest of his early mentor and patron, Dr. John Fisher, Bishop of Salisbury.  He told Farington (Greig, Vol. VII, p. 70) that he stayed three weeks.  It was probably at this time that he first met the Bishop\u2019s nephew, John Fisher, recently ordained deacon at Salisbury (Beckett, VI, pp. 11-14).\nIn his letter of 12 November 1811 to Miss Bicknell, Constable says, after the extract quoted in the note to No. 103 [135-1888], \u201cSalisbury has afforded some sketches.  Mr. Stothard admired them and one in particular (a general view of Sarum) he recommends me to paint, and of a respectable size\u201d (L. ed. S., pp. 47 and 48).  This in due course became one of Constable\u2019s exhibits at the Royal Academy in 1812, \u2018Salisbury: Morning\u2019.  Other drawings made by the artist on the same visit are known, for example \u2018Old Sarum\u2019, dated 14 September 1811, in the Oldham Art Gallery and \u2018St. Anne\u2019s Gate, Salisbury\u2019, dated 17 September 1811, shown at Messrs.  Spink\u2019s, 1947.  A drawing of the west end of Salisbury Cathedral in the Beckett collection, of the same type as Nos. 106-108 [825-1888, 832-1888, 614-1888], and measuring 5 7/8 and 3 \u00bc ins., was No. 101 [128-1888] in the exhibition of the work of Constable in the Manchester City Art Gallery, 1956.  A drawing of the gardens of Sir Richard Colt Hoare at Stourhead, dated 2 October 1811, now in the Fogg Art Museum, Cambridge, U.S.A., is reproduced from the collection of Sir Robert Witt in L. ed. S.

His attachment to Maria Bicknell became known during this year, and he received her father's permission to write to her in October.'\n\n[G Reynolds, 1973, p. 69]",
