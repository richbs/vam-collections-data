Most theatres in the 19th century would have had some made to mark grand openings or milestone performances. By the end of the First World War however the practice had generally died out, only being revived very occasionally,  more often at London's opera houses than any other theatres.\n\nThis silk programme was produced for the opening in England of The Naval Cadets by Richard Genee at the Globe Theatre, 27 March 1880. The lessee of the theatre, Alexander Henderson, had also been lessee of the Criterion and Folly Theatres but had disposed of the Criterion lease early in 1879 to Charles Wyndham, and that of the Folly to Selina Dolaro who played Cerisette in The Naval Cadetsat the Globe.",
