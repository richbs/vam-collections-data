The clasp itself is round and deeply domed, looking like a small turban made of strips of gilded sheet silver.  It is hinged to the end segment of the belt and fastens with a snap clasp.  Each of the belt segments is decorated with a central panel of thin gilded sheet silver, pierced in a pattern of curls, which is laid over the solid backing and held in place by fluted domes with screws at the back.   The domes and the clasp are decorated with applied coil rings and braided wire, and there is a border of braided wire round the rim of each segment of the belt.  The narrow edges of each segment have a hatched triangular pattern.",

Over time they grew in prosperity, and always remained quite distinct from the local population, in law, language, religion and costume.\n\nThe marriage belt was one of the most visible and ostentatious signs of identity for women in this community. It was based on the kinds of belt worn throughout Europe by the aristocracy in the late medieval period.  This example is more modest than many, and lacks the rich enamelled bosses, set with garnets, turquoises, and fresh-water pearls, which were considered typical of Transylvanian Saxon jewellery by the end of the 19th century.\n\nIt carries the silver mark of Martinus Regis, who was a silversmith working in Sibiu, the cultural capital of the Transylvanian Saxons, in the mid-17th century.",
