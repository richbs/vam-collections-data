            "public_access_description": "This extraordinary sculpture of a vulture is from the porcelain menagerie commissioned by Augustus the Strong, Elector of Saxony, for the 'Japanese Palace' in Dresden. This commission is one of the great landmarks in ceramic history. Nearly 600 life-size animals were planned, and at least 458 were made. Work began in 1730, only 20 years after Meissen had become the first European factory to make porcelain in the Chinese manner. \n\nAugustus had specified that the animals should have their natural colours. Normally, this would be achieved by the use of enamels. However, the factory technicians thought it too risky to subject the largest models to the heat of an enamel firing. Instead they partly painted them in bright, unfired pigments. Such colours rarely survive, as they fade over time and have often been completely removed.\n\nThis King Vulture model exists in three different versions: some crouching, some with head down, and some standing upright. These variations were introduced by the 'repairer' (the skilled craftsman who assembled the separately moulded parts of the model prior to firing), probably in the interest of variety.",
