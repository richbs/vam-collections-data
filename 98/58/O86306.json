It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre. He compiled them in a series of albums.\n\nThe drawing shows the triple bars on which Dezmonti & Mora performed, and captures the comic pose of one of the duo as he appears to be about to fall off the apparatus. Comic acrobatics were popular on the variety stage. The duo was appearing at the Grand the week after a similar act performed by Burns & Evans, whom Cooke also sketched. Dezmonti & Mora were on the same bill as the comedian George Antill, another of Cooke\u2019s subjects.",
