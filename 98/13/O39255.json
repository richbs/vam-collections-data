The front and back covers are both decorated with five medallions each within an elaborate padded frame worked in metal purl and coil. Within the central medallion is a fountain worked three dimensionally in metal strip, purl and coil.  In the four surrounding medallions are the four evangelists worked with coloured silks in long and short, split, stem and brick stitches, with French knots, some raised work and details in metal coil.\n\nThe spine is divided into four compartments by raised lines of metal thread, and within each compartment is a raised metal thread cartouche containing a formal pattern of a flowerhead within an oval, worked in laid metal thread and silk.\n\nThe whole is outlined with a raised border. Two rows of heavy chain stitch with, between them, a couched line of silver coil.\n[Book mark] Bookmark with a T-bar of pink silk threads round a hard core with silver thread, leaving tufts of silk at either end. A plaited pink silk bar is attached to the under side and to this are tied two lines of plaited threads to lie between the pages. Both plaited lines are later replacements.",

Although new covers might sometimes be made for precious books of an earlier date, the embroidery here is likely to be contemporary with the books.\n\nMaterials & Making\nBookbindings were sometimes worked by skilled amateur embroiderers. The best known examples are a series of books with embroidered bindings made by the future Queen Elizabeth I as New Year gifts for her father, Henry VIII, and his last wife, Katherine Parr. However, the materials that have been used here - metal thread, strip and purl - are difficult to use. When applied in embroidery of this quality, they almost always indicate professional work.\n\nPeople\nThis binding was almost certainly carried out by a member of the Broderers' Company in London. The company was granted its charter for the organisation of professional work in 1561 and regulated the quality of embroideries sold to the public.",
