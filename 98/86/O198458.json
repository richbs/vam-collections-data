Linnaeus likewise introduced a nomenclature for species for animals, in his <u>Systema Naturae</u> 10th edition, volume 1(1758).\n\nThe obverse of the medal presents Linnaeus' drawing of Andromeda from the expedition in Lapland he headed in 1732, and during which he discovered a hundred botanical species.  The reverse is modelled on Ehret's original illustration for Linnaeus' <u>Systema Naturae</u>. It shows Linnaeus' system of using the flower and the arrangement of its sexual organs (stamens and pistils)  to group plants into twenty-four classes. The twenty-four classes are arranged in a spiral, coming out of a profile of Linnaeus.\n\nGiven together with A.2:2-2009, by Glenn Benson.",

The recipients of the Linnaean Tercentenary Silver Medal are selected for being \"internationally recognised for their contribution to our understanding of the natural world, particularly at the higher, organisational levels\" and \"outstanding and effective popularisers, particularly of the broad concepts of evolution and the importance of biodiversity\".  The Linnaean Tercentenary Bronze Medal is given to Fellows of the Society in recognition for their assistance and work.\n\nThe Linnean Society of London was founded in 1788. It takes its name from the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778), whose botanical and zoological collections and library have been in the Society's keeping since 1829.",
