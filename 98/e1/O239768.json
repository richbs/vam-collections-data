            "public_access_description": "Four designs for embroidery, about 1848, by Sarah Bland (1810-1905).  The largest design is a drawing of a fuchsia and forget-me-knot sprig within a semi-circular border for a dress flounce. Bland used the design for the flounce of a dress in muslin on net, inscribing it 'Muslin on Net for dress flounce'.  The fuchsia and forget-me-knot combination is close to parts of patterns in The Lady's Newspaper  No. 82, Saturday, July 22, 1848, p. 67; The Lady's Newspaper , Saturday, July 29, 1848, No. 83, and shows the fashionable status of this particular flower as a motif in 1848.  The designs at the top are for continous floral borders. The fourth design features a stylised fleur-de-lis motif in a circular shape which is for a penwiper. \n\nThese designs are in an album which includes Bland's collection of  her own botanically accurate designs, simplified patterns from accurate botanical observation, patterns traced from magazines, commercial, printed Berlin wool work patterns, gifts of patterns, including commercial ones from friends and relatives. The designs include those for petit-point, bead-work, decoration for dresses, collars and cuffs, aprons, slippers, tablecloths and covers, cushions, bags, penwipers, initial letters, alphabets etc. In Bland's case, the gift of designs demonstrates connections between relatives of merchant and banking families and is of historical significance in bonding such families.",

Women's amateur as opposed to professional designs for embroidery raise problems because amateur work has tended to be regarded as less significant. Embroidery was a pastime but was also an economic activity. Upper middle class women's property was closely linked to their status within the family as daughters, wives and widows and only allowed semi-independence. This semi-independence was underpinned by legal, political, and social practices which subordinated them. Nevertheless, it was combined with recognition of their economic worth within the family enterprise. However, women were restricted as they often could not be openly involved in working for money. See L. Davidoff and C. Hall (Reference Tab). Bland could not be seen to be working but it is likely that she embroidered accessories for dress, penwipers, tablecloths, book covers, and cushions as gifts which were her contribution to the household, wider family, and friendship. The quality of her samplers and designs shows the value of such gifts in terms of relationships with family and friends.\n\nMaterial about the perceptions of a woman's role is pertinent to the discourse on women and therefore gender history. In Bland's case, the gift of designs demonstrates connections between relatives of merchant and banking families and is of historical significance in bonding between such families.",
