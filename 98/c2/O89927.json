Between about 1800 and 1805 Hope deliberately set out to improve public taste and standards of craftsmanship, by commissioning furnishings for his house to his own designs, and granting admission to selected visitors including leading designers and makers of luxury goods. In 1807 he published views of the principal reception rooms in the house, and of many individual objects, in a large folio volume, Household Furniture and Interior Decoration. This table is illustrated there as a single object, but does not appear in any of the room views. Its modest size suggests that it may have been made for one of the smaller and more intimate family rooms on the top floor of the house, which were not illustrated in Household Furniture.",
