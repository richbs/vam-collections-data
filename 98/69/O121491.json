            "public_access_description": "Earthenware flatbacks and figurines for mantelpiece decoration were first produced in  Staffordshire in the late 1830s.  The earliest datable Staffordshire figures appear to be those of Queen Victoria, who was crowned in 1837.  Images of royalty proved lucrative and during the 1840s there were countless royal figures issued by Staffordshire pottery firms, celebrating for example Victoria's marriage to Prince Albert in 1840, and the birth of the royal children. Although a few Staffordshire portrait figures were produced after Victoria's death in 1901, few appear to have been produced after 1905.  During their heyday however they were produced in vast numbers, usually modelled after prints. As well as the royal family they represented a wide variety of subjects, those of actors and actresses being especially popular.\n\nThis represents Mr. Barton who played Gaffeir, the Pasha of Abydos, in The Bride of Abydos at Astley's Circus in 1847. William Dimond originally dramatised Byron's 1813 poem for the stage and it was first performed at Drury Lane Theatre in 1818.  Gaffier is Zuleika's father who died of a broken heart in the original version  because Gaffier kills Salim.  In Astley's equestrian version the ending was changed so that Salim killed Gaffier and won Zuleika's heart.",
