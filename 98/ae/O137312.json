Throughout his working life he was involved with outdoor sculpture projects; he was twice artist in residence at Grizedale Forest, Cumbria (1979-80 and 1981-82), and also created work for Yorkshire Sculpture Park in the early 1980s, the Forest of Dean sculpture trail in 1986, and Sculpture at Goodwood, West Sussex (now the Cass Sculpture Foundation) in 1997. \n\nSmith also made drawings, not as preparatory studies for sculpture but as independent works of art. He always carried a sketchbook. Towards the end of his life Smith made a number of drawings and watercolours of the River Thames from near his home in Greenwich, often, as in this example, with broken wooden poles breaking through the surface.",
