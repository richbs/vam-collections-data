He was top of the bill at the Grand Theatre of Varieties, Hanley, during the week of 6 February 1905, with his act which featured a chorus of 20 local boys. They performed \u2018Britannia\u2019s Babes\u2019 in naval training uniform, singing and performing naval drill. This was a return visit to Hanley for Leyton, who had appeared there the previous April with a chorus of 30 Potteries boys 'and the local Crimean veteran\u2019. It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre. \n\nBorn Henry Hackett in 1864, in New Orleans, USA, of an English father, Leyton made his first stage appearance in London in 1889 at the Princess\u2019s Theatre, where he sang the title song in the play True Heart. His first appearance in music hall in 1890 at the Royal Music Hall was followed by engagements at the Trocadero and the Oxford. By 1916 he had appeared at every leading London Variety Theatre. He was well known for songs  including: \u2018All Hands on Deck\u2019, \u2018Always Ready\u2019 and \u2018Boys of the Chelsea School\u2019.",

Born Henry Hackett  in 1864 in New Orleans in the USA of an English father, he made his first stage appearance in 1889 at the Princess's Theatre in the play 'True Heart' singing the title song.  His first appearance in music hall in1890 at the Royal Music Hall was followed by engagements at the Trocadero and the Oxford.  By 1916 he had appeared at every leading London theatre and was well known for songs including 'All hands on Deck', 'Always Ready' and 'Boys of the Chelsea School'. They may have been a re-vamped version of The New Macs who were on the bill at the Middlesex Music Hall in 1887 and at the London Pavilion in 1891.",
