The border is commonly found with circular plaquettes by Moderno.\nDa Geremia (ca. 1430-ca. 1475) was a sculptor and medallist of Mantua, whose name appears also as Christophorus Hierimia, Christophorus de Geremiis de Mantua. Filaretus mentions him in 1460 as one of the best contemporary sculptors.\nPlaquettes are small plaques or reliefs made of bronze, brass, lead or precious metals. They originated in the 1440ies with the desire to reproduce coins and hardstone engravings from ancient Greece and Rome. Some were made as collector's pieces, to be viewed and displayed in private, and others for practical purposes. They also inspired designs in other media, from architecture to bookbindings.",
