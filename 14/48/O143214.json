During the Industrial Revolution, however, steel became fashionable for jewellery. It regained importance in the second half of the 20th century, as did aluminium, which had been discovered in the early 19th century but was initially very expensive. Platinum one of the most valuable of metals, usually used in fine settings for diamonds, also found a modern interpretation. \n\nJewellers of the 1970s explored many ways of treating the surfaces of these non-tarnishable and non-corroding silvery-white metals to give them a new appearance. \n\nThe Slovakian Anton Cepka studied wood carving at the School of Arts and Crafts in Bratislava, and metalwork at the Academy of Decorative Arts, in Prague. In the 1960s he was internationally recognised as an artist jeweller in what was at the time the Czech Republic. Today he lives in Slovakia, and in 1996 founded a department for jewellery and metalwork at the Academy of Fine Arts in Bratislava.\n\nSilver is for Cepka a basic material, either as sheets, perforated or in form of wire constructions. His designs reflect his interest in aviation and space technology. A further inspiration for him is Constructivist art, visible in his choice of abstract and geometric forms.",
