It was bought for the study collections of the Government School of Design from the 'Triennial Exposition of Articles of Manufacture' in Paris.  The Superintendent of the Schools, Charles Heath Wilson, had been sent to Paris to buy plaster casts and objects which were fine examples of different crafts and manufactures.  He clearly had a good eye, because the young carver of this piece was to become one of the most influential French designers of the nineteenth century.  Li\u00e9nard carried out schemes of carving for palaces, cathedrals and public buildings, including the celebrated restoration of the Ch\u00e2teau de Blois where he worked with the architect F\u00e9lix Duban (1798-1870) from 1845, working also with him on the restoration of the Louvre from 1849. Late in his career, Li\u00e9nard provided some of the best-known craftsmen and manufacturers with designs for armour, jewellery and metalwork. He participated in many of the international exhibitions of his time, but his name was often overshadowed by that of the people responsible for making the pieces.",
