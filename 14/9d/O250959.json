The Villa Madama was begun in 1517 but hardly got beyond the great portico. It was designed by Raphael and includes decoration by Giovanni da Udine and Giulio Romano. The latter worked in Raphael\u2019s studio and may have assisted with the architecture. The villa was intended to evoke the magnificence of ancient Rome, inspired by the great Roman baths and Pliny\u2019s description of his villa. One of the characteristics of the plan, the use of large apses, has been modified by Chambers. Chambers omitted two doorways from a passage leading to a courtyard and a second apse which he replaced with a replica of the end wall of the left-hand compartment. This demonstrates that he was visiting Roman sites to select things that would be useful in his future career as an architect. A related sketch plan (cat.366) also modifies the original.\n\nChambers moved to London in 1755 and published his influential Treatise on Civil Architecture in 1759.  Chambers demonstrated the breadth of his style in buildings such as Gower (later Carrington) House and Melbourne House, London, in such country houses as Duddingston, Scotland, and in the garden architecture he designed for Wilton House, Wiltshire, and at Kew Gardens. He became head of government building in 1782, and in this capacity built Somerset House, London.",
