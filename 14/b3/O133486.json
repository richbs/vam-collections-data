It shows all Messel's characteristic style and colouring, the leaves drawn in sweeping lines and intense greens, separated by panels of dull purples and mauves, split by black and white lines, like a distorted Regency stripe.  The blue hand on the lid gives a surreal touch, although the significance is not clear.   \n\nCustomising storage was typical of Messel.  Famously, he designed a theatrical proscenium arch, with curtain, to hide his television set.  \n\nOliver Messel (1904-1978) was Britain\u2019s leading theatre designer throughout the 1930s, \u201840s and \u201850s, mastering every aspect of entertainment - ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue - as well working in interior decoration and textile design. His lavish, painterly and romantic concepts were perfectly in tune with the times and earned him an international reputation.  By 1960, however, that style was becoming unfashionable, and Messel gradually abandoned theatre and built a new career designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.",
