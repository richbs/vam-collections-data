The front panel is gathered and smocked and flared below the waist.  The bodice fastens at the side with two rows of buttons for easy adjustment of size.  The sleeves are just below elbow-length, and straight.  An asymmetric drape with its back points gathered into a bustle and two tiers of flounces are mounted on the underskirt, which is straight in front and gathered at the centre back.  The dress is machine stitched and simple but effective in concept.  It has fashionable features, bustle drape and copious trimming, but is comparatively tough, light and easy to wear and wash.  It is said to have been made in Clifton, Bristol, in 1885 and worn in Burma.",
