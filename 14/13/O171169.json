Like Catholic women elsewhere in southern Europe they often wore elaborate crosses as jewellery.\n\nThe tiny loop at the top shows that this cross was originally part of an elaborate pendant, hanging down almost to the waist.  The design of these pendants was based on a stomacher, which was a fashionable piece of jewellery among the upper classes throughout Europe in the 18th century.  But the detail and execution of this piece are uniquely Italian.  Crosses like this were worn with traditional costume throughout northern and central Italy, often with matching earrings. \n\nIt was bought as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
