            "public_access_description": "The current church of San Francesco della Vigna dates from 1534 and replaces an older church built in the XIIIth century. Jacopo Sansovino (1486-1570) designed it and also directed the work while the fa\u00e7ade was later restored by Andrea Palladio (1508-80). The drawing depicts the fa\u00e7ade which has a tall main door surmounted by a domed pediment and a cornice supported by two Corinthian columns with a compartmented bow window above. Four larger Corinthian columns supported the pediment that completes the roof above a cornice with Latin inscription and a carved eagle enclosed in a tondo. Two niches with full-length statues are situated on each side of the door. The fa\u00e7ade has also two receding lateral wing surmounted by a half pediment each, supported by Corinthian columns. \n\nAntonio Visentini (Venice, 21 Nov 1688 \u2013 Venice, 26 June 1782) was an Italian painter, engraver, architect and theorist. He was first known as a painter and trained with the Venetian history painter Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini (1675-1741). He became known as an engraver by the end of the 1720s when he was commissioned by Joseph Smith to produce engravings of Canaletto\u2019s views of Venice. Visentini started working as an architect in 1731, and his first theoretical work, Libro di Architettura, which included Rococo-influenced drawings by Pier Antonio Morelli after Visentini\u2019s ideas, was published in 1733. \n\nHis ideas on contemporary architecture derived from Antiquity and the work of Andrea Palladio (1508-80). Later however, Visentini developed neo-Palladian and anti-Baroque ideas. Visentini and his pupils executed numerous drawings of ancient and contemporary buildings intended to disseminate exemplary architecture. He participated to the foundation of the Venetian Academy in 1755, where he became a teacher of architectural perspective in 1772.",
