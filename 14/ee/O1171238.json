He was memorable for playing a star-shaped guitar and he also wrote the band's several top ten songs from the early to mid 1970s.\n\nAlthough his guitar was custom made, this guitar strap was produced by Gibson, a corporation based in Nashville Tennessee. Originally a manufacturer of mandolins in 1902, they began producing solid body electric guitars in 1950 and designed the most popular electric guitar still, the Les Paul. The company's logo, embossed on the wider half of this guitar strap, has remained in the same block style since 1946.",
