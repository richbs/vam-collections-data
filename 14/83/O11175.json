The print is a culmination of Wayne's water-tusche and salt experiments, and her inventive use of sand, twigs, wood, paper, glass and other materials as stop-outs. In st.III tiny lemming people were added to the plate. When Wayne, by then deeply interested in outer space, visited Palomar Observatory in 1987 and saw an enlarged picture of the Andromeda Galaxy, she felt the astronomers had copied her. The title celebrates the fact that Tamarind's numbering system initiated by its first Associate Director, Clinton Adams, had reached 1000, and the staff set the number aside for the Directors use. In fact,Adams, who did not want record numbers with less tha three digits, began the sequence with the number 101. It is therfore likely that Wayne's print was actually earlier in the sequence.\"",
