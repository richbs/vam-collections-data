ISBN 1851773088.\nAfter training as an architect, Alfred Powell moved to Gloucestershire at the turn of the century, where he learned local crafts such as chair-making. In 1906 he and his wife Louise were engaged to work for Wedgwood, and their ceramics were particularly sought after by country house owners enamoured of the designs of the Arts and Crafts movement. When V&A ceramics curator Bernard Rackham was offered this vase in 1938, by the artist, he described it as \n\"\"a large vase . . . with painted landscape decoration . . . a spare piece from a set of vases made to decorate the house of Sir Hugh Bell [at Rounton] and certainly an important piece of pottery decoration in the manner fashionable two or three decades ago. It was thrown at Wedgwood's and is a remarkable example of pottery, quite apart from the very individual decoration.\"\"\nThe director, Sir Eric Maclagan, responded less enthusiastically: \"It seems very difficult to refuse this offer. But I am not very anxious to make additions to our collections of Modern Pottery at Bethnal Green at the present. . . . Still this particular vase had better in the circumstances be accepted.\" The vase cost \u00a350, which was raised by Powell's friends, including George Eumorfopoulos (see cat. 108), as a gift to the Museum.\nAt the time of its acquisition, the Museum was more interested in the vase's technical superiority than in its aesthetic merit; Rackham, for instance, stressed the tour de force of potting in this enormous size. Its artistic significance was first recognised in the Museum's influential 1952 exhibition, \"Victorian and Edwardian Decorative Arts.\"\n\nLit. Honey, 1948b, pl. 86; V&A, 1952, no.
