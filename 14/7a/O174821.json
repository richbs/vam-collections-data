London : Futures Publications, 1991.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows: \n\n'<b>PLATE 3.23.c : 12-inch 45 rpm single record sleeve.</b> \n<i>Better Must Come</i>. Junior C. Reaction. \nDes: Stephen Horse. Offset lithography. \nChrysalis Records Ltd. 1986. E.1198-1988. \nIn spite of claims in the 1970s that there were supply problems with paper and vinyl, the 12-inch single format was introduced to give songs a higher marketing profile. Songs were extended and re-mixed to create a 'new' product that 'improved' overall sales figures. An additional benefit of the format was that the widely-spaced microgrooves on a large vinyl platter offered finer sound reproduction. Here, like some film or television programme title the artist's name is projected away from the housing blocks, and seems to break out of the sleeve's grey world.'",
