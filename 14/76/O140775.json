The patterns were considered particularly appropriate for textile design because of their repetitive symmetry and natural beauty.\n\nMegaw\u2019s idea caught the attention of Mark Hartland Thomas from the Council of Industrial Design. For the forthcoming Festival of Britain in 1951 Hartland Thomas put together a group of manufacturers known as the Festival Pattern Group who produced textiles, china, carpets, linoleum and wallpaper decorated with crystallographic patterns. The project combined science and design and was perfect for the theme of the festival, which had been conceived as a platform for British ingenuity and creativity in science, technology and the arts.  \n\nThis carpet sample's pattern was based on a crystal structure diagram of perovskite, a material with the same type of crystal structure as calcium titanium oxide. The pattern was designed by L. Halliday and the crystallographer was Helen Megaw herself. It is one of a group of samples made by the carpet manufacturers James Templeton & Co for the Festival Pattern Group.",
