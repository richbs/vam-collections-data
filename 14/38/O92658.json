            "public_access_description": "The naginata was a type of polearm, or halberd, with a curved blade that could vary in size from about 25cm to 80cm.  The pole on which it was mounted could also vary in size.  It was an extremely effective weapon against opponents on foot and could keep a swordsman at a distance whilst enabling the naginata user to cut him. The naginata was especially useful against mounted samurai and was used to attack a horse's legs to dismount enemies and then to cut them once they had fallen.  The first use of the naginata in combat was in an 11th century document - 'Oshu Gosannenki' - A Diary of Three Years in Oushu.  From this time on it became a favoured weapon of Japan's militant Buddhist monks, the Sohei.  \n\nIn combat it was generally used to cut in large sweeping motions but could also be used for thrusting as the point could penetrate traditional Japanese armour, especially with the thrust from a long pole.  The butt-end of the pole had a steel end-cap that could also be used for attack.  \n\nThe naginata was also used to a great extent by women warriors and Samurai women were frequently well trained in its use. The naginata could be used effectively by women to protect themselves (and their children) by keeping an attacker at a safe distance.  In the peaceful Edo period, the naginata was still regarded as an effective weapon but tended to be used in ceremonial parades, rather than in combat.",
