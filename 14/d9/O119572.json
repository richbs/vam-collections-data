            "public_access_description": "Cecilia Mandrile uses her computer as a portable studio and, with her printer, she can work anywhere, from airport lounge to bus station. Since leaving Argentina in her 20s she has travelled widely and her work addresses themes of homelessness and itineracy. \n\nFrom 2002 to 2004 Mandrile made a set of 'ID' cards. She sees the letters 'ID' as standing not for 'Identity' but for 'Intensively Displaced', referring to the way in which many migrants are under pressure to leave their homeland and are constantly forced to move from place to place. \n\nThe cards imitate tourist snapshots and feature home-made dolls incorporating computer-manipulated self-portraits (see Museum no. E.214:1-2005). Their sorrowful, shadowy features, bandaged heads and bleak surroundings remind the viewer that these snapshots show neither comfortable homes nor exotic holiday resorts but simply places where migrants make do with scant resources. \n\nHere a doll is shown against the background of a 17th-century building in the historical city of Bath in the United Kingdom.",
