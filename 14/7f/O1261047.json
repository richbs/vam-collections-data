Buttons made from seashells, with holes for threading, have been found dating back to 2000 BCE, although these were probably used with more decorative purpose. Functional buttons, designed to fasten with buttonholes, were first seen in Germany in the 13th century. Over the centuries following, the history of the button reflects trends in applied aesthetics, designed by artists or in cottage industries, made from seashell, metals, woods and as this one, with plastic. This particular one reflects the 20th century development in mass produced clothing, made on a machine designed to replicate the exact design very quickly and easily.",
