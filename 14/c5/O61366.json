The room itself is to be given to a local museum.\n\n5 February 1913 Minute paper by BSL\nDetailed report of inspection of the house in Turret Lane in the course of demolition.  He dates the frescoe from the 16th century and describes in detail the materials used: wattles and plaster mixed with straw between vertical beams faced with lime plaster containing hair and then whitewashed.  The designs on the portions offered to the local museum are executed \"with considerable boldness and freedom\".  Those offered to the V & A are rather cramped within their respective fields (photos are included).\n\nInterest is also expressed in some old wall-paper from the room.\n\n15 February 1913 Minute paper of O Brackett\ncompares this frescoe to that in the Museum from Lincolns Inn.  He recommends acceptance of a few pieces or a complete panel.\n\n15 February 1913 Strange Minute\nrequests any specimens of the paper that can be spared.  He dates it from 2nd half of the 16th century.\n\n15 February 1913 letter C Smith to Parkington\naccepts the offer of the portions of plaster or a complete panel, if one can be spared.\n\nThe Times, Monday 3 February 1913\nReports the discovery of the frescoe work in the building known as Monastery House, in Turret Lane.  Local authorities hold it is the work of Italian workmen resident in England.  Others hold it was more likely the work of British workmen influenced by Flemish models.  The area was at one time associated with the Black Friars, but the priory was suppressed by Wolsey to make way for his college in Ipswich.\n\nAn illustrated information sheet\nregarding the frescoe written by Frank Woolnough, Curator of the Ipswich Museum, and  \nAn article from the East Anglian Daily Times 3 February 1913\nare also in the R. P. file.  \nDisagreements about the date and authorship of the decoration are reported.  The frescoe is to be transferred to a suitable position in Christchurch mansion.\n\n22 February 1913 Gift form\nthe condition of the panel of painted plasterwork , enclosed in oak beams is noted: \"surface considerably rubbed and damaged, and woodwork worm-eaten\".\n\n(the wallpaper was also given to the V & A E1735-38)",
