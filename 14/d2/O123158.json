Worked first as a bank clerk, then studied at the Munich Academy 1829 and soon after in Venice for two years. Lived for a time in Rome, toured in the East, and Hungary and Transylvania, before settling in London. Exhibited 87 works at the RA between 1836 and 1880, 86 at the BI 1837-67, and ten at the SBA 1836-4l. Most were Italian landscapes, particularly lake scenes, where he visited regularly. Published 'Sketches on the Danube ... ' (1838) and 20 lithographs in 'The Mountains and Lakes of Switzerland, the Tyrol, and Italy' (1847). Drew illustrations for his friend John Paget's <i>Hungary and Transylvania</i> ... (1839). Died St John's Wood, London, 18 December 1879. His wife was also an artist, exhibiting similar subjects at the RA and BI between 1840 and 1858. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1861, pp73-5; <i>Athenaeum</i> 27 December 1879, p856 (obit); <i>Art Journal</i> 1880, pp83-4 (obit) \n\n<b>Bridge Over a Stream</b> \n1399-1869 \nPanel, 26.6 x 49.5 cm (10\u00bd x 19\u00bd ins) \nSigned and dated 'G E Hering 1847' br \nTownshend Bequest 1869 \n\nNot identifiable with the titles of any exhibited paintings; while the landscape has no distinguishing features that indicate the location, it seems probably a Scottish rather than an Italian scene, possibly on the Isle of Arran, which Hering visited. He exhibited Scottish landscapes in 1851 and from 1867 onwards; of 'The Brig Ower the Burn - Perthshire', exhibited at the RA in 1851, the <i>Art Journal</i> critic wrote 1861, p75 that it was 'one of the few pictures of home scenery painted by this artist'.\"",

As can be ascertained from the registered files, the bequest entered the museum in that year. In his introduction to <i> A Descriptive Catalogue of the Historical Collection of Water-colour Paintings in the South Kensington Museum </i> (London: Chapman na d Hall, 1876) Samuel Redgrave also gives the date of the bequest as 1868 as does Kauffman in; Kauffmann, C.M.<i>Catalogue of Foreign Paintings, II. 1800-1900</i> (Victoria and Albert Museum, London: 1973). However in more recent publications the date has been given as 1869, which is the year in which the objects were catalogued.",
