They were called 'canisters' until about 1800, when they became known as 'caddies', the term we use today.  They were placed on the table as tea was served, and were therefore decorated in a variety of fashionable styles.\n\nOwnership & Use\nTea was a popular drink even in smaller households in the later 18th century, although the price was high owing to import restrictions and duties. All tea came from China until 1839, when Indian tea began to be imported.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe caddy is in the form of an octagonal urn or vase, in the Neo-classical style fashionable in the 1770s and 1780s.  The eight sides show off the figure of the wood veneer to great effect.  Around the rim of the cover is a border pattern of vertical stripes, stained green, which accentuate the shape.  Knife cases in the shape of vases were also popular dining-room accessories.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe body of the caddy is made of oak and beech, veneered with bird's-eye maple, from the North American maple tree. The inside of the caddy is lined with lead and the lid is lined with marbled paper (coloured to imitate marble). The base is veneered in mahogany. The finial, or knob, at the top of the lid is made of turned wood.",
