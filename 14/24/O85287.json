A fine tobacco powder known as snuff was inhaled from the back of the hand or the fingertips.  Dried tobacco leaves were generally sold in tightly bound bundles, and, although commercially produced snuff was available, many snuffers preferred to make their own. Snuff rasps like this one were developed to be conveniently carried in a pocket so that a portion of snuff could be prepared at any time by grinding a bundle of dired tobacco leaves on the metal grater or rasp.  Some snuff rasps incorporate a snuff-box to hold any excess produced, although this examples does not.  \n\nSnuff-taking was an expensive habit and could only be afforded by the well-to-do, with the result that snuff-related objects, such as rasps and boxes, often incorporate precious materials like ivory, and are beautifully decorated with carving or inlay.  This German example is made from fruitwood inlaid with ivory, mother of pearl and stained wood. The decoration shows a man playing the violin.  The form of this snuff rasp is quite unusual in that it has a separate sliding lid topped with mirror glass (now damaged).  The lid was intended to cover the metal grater, protecting the owner's fingers and pocket lining.",
