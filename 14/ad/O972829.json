            "public_access_description": "This plate comes from a set that form a frieze about 54 meters in length, depicting an allegorical Triumphal Procession. 139 plates were planned for the scheme. This was one of three large-scale mural projects which together reflected Emperor Maximilian I's (1459-1519) status as Holy Roman Emperor and linked him symbolically with ancient Rome. The project was not finished by the time of Maximilian's death but the set was published later, in 1526.\n\nHans Burgkmair designed much of the procession, begun in about 1512, with contributions from Albrecht Altdorfer, Hans Springinklee, Hans Beck and Hans Scheufelein. The designs were cut by Jost de Negker's large team of block-cutters.\n\nThe two other mural projects include a large Triumphal Arch, about 12 feet high by 10 feet wide and made up of 192 blocks, and a Triumphal Carriage about 8 feet long made up of 8 blocks. These were designed by Albrecht D\u00fcrer, with assistance from Hans Springinklee, Wolf Traut and Albrecht Altdorfer.\n\nThe procession was not intended for sale. The city of Nuremberg apologised to the Emperor for some impressions from the blocks having been sold. The friezes were intended as gifts for wall display. According to surviving correspondence, Maximilian wanted the procession to 'grace the walls of council chambers and great halls of the empire, proclaiming for posterity the noble aims of their erstwhile ruler'.",

            "history_note": "This plate comes from a set that form a frieze about 54 meters in length, depicting an allegorical Triumphal Procession. 139 plates are known for the scheme, begun in about 1512. This was one of three large-scale mural projects which together reflected Emperor Maximilian's status as Holy Roman Emperor and linked him symbolically with ancient Rome (the other two projects were a Triumphal Carriage by Albrecht D\u00fcrer; published 1522, and a Triumphal Arch. The project was not finished after the death of Maximilian. The scrolls and tablets without inscriptions. In the early edition these were printed in black. The first edition, 200 copies of the completed 137 blocks, was printed in 1526 on the order of Ferdinand, Archduke of Tyrol. A second edition was printed in 1777, consisting of 135 blocks.\n\nHans Burgkmair contributed 67 plates and Albrecht Altdorfer 38. Other artists were Hans Springinklee (20 plates), Hans Beck (7 plates) and Hans Sch\u00e4ufelein (2 plates). The designs were cut by Jost de Negker's large team of block-cutters, work on the blocks carried out between 1516 and 1519. Blockcutters sometimes signed their name on the back of the blocks (most of which survive in Vienna), one of whom was Cornelius Liefrinck. The programme was worked out by Emperor Maximilian I and Johannes Stabius and written down by his secretary Marx Treitsaurwein. Altdorfer and his workshop produced a set of miniatures (62 now in Vienna Albertina), following the same instructions.\n  \nThe two other mural projects were designed by Albrecht D\u00fcrer with assistance from Hans Springinklee, Wolf Traut and Albrecht Altdorfer. They are a large Triumphal Arch in 192 blocks, almost 12 feet high and 10 feet wide when assembled, and a Triumphal Carriage in 8 large blocks, of 8 feet in length.",
