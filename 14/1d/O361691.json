The napkins and cloths of this pattern seem to have been woven at Dumferline by Messers James Matthewson & Sons Ltd or their predescessors Messrs David Dewar Son & Sons, who were succeeded by Messrs Matthewson about 1860. Messrs Matthewson possess sample napkins of this pattern showing slight differences, but have no record of the weaving of the cloth; consequently, this pattern was probably woven before they took over from Messrs Dewar and presumably therefore the design would have been woven long before 1860, as no record exists of it at the works.",
