The rapier and dagger combination was primarily designed for self-defence using fighting techniques developed in Italy that are the ancestors of modern fencing. The sixteenth-century rapier was both a slashing and stabbing weapon. Its accompanying dagger was used in the left hand for parrying and stabbing in close. The stiff slender blades of both were designed to pierce clothing rather than armour.\n\nThe rapier and dagger were also male fashion accessories worn at court, in procession and about town. They projected an image of honour based on social standing and, if necessary, defended it in one-on-one combat.\n\nKnives and daggers were also practical everyday tools attached to the belts of men of all ranks. A small sheath might contain several knives and tools for hunting, eating, personal grooming and self-defence. This set contains a bodkin, a needle-like device used in personal grooming and dressing. For the gentleman, the more expensive and elaborate dagger was a costume accessory.\n\nDecorated daggers were not only lethal weapons but were works of art. They were part of the same aesthetic that produced decorated tapestries, furniture, silver and ceramics. This dagger and sheath are capped with silver mounts which are engraved with 'arabesques', stylised curling foliage reminiscent of Islamic ornament.",

In this sense, it is the epitome of the new sense of self fostered by the Renaissance. It was an emblem of personal vanity that settled disputes privately.\n\nThe conservative English defence expert, George Silver, felt a noble heritage of purpose-made war blades, clubs, flails and maces had been sacrificed at the altar of fashion as swords and daggers became faddish civilian accessories. \u2018We like degenerate sonnes, have forsaken our forefathers vertues with their weapons.\u2019\n\nKnives and daggers were also practical everyday tools attached to the belts of men of all ranks.
