Bidri ware describes objects made from a zinc alloy and decorated with silver. The final stage of the manufacturing process involves covering the entire object with a mud paste: when removed shortly afterwards, the dull grey of the alloy has been changed to a matt black but the silver remains unchanged. By the 19th century, the technique had spread to other centres in India. This urn, acquired by the South Kensington Museum in 1854, was probably made in Purnea, Bengal.",
