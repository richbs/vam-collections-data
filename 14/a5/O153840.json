Row [1] has an 8-pointed star in either dark blue with a red diamond in the centre or a red star with a green diamond.  Brackets at the corners form an interrupted square around the star. This motif alternates with a white horizontal cartouche with a small vertical green cartouche, blue diamond and horizontal arch-shaped segments.\nRow [2] has a light blue vertical cartouche like the cartouche in row [1] but in different colours alternating with a blue pointed square containing a light yellow star.  Black lines from the corner of this pointed square join the corners of the dark blue or red stars.  The border has a very pale grey ground with a lobed diamond in yellow alternating with a lobed cartouche in pink.\nFacing: bias-cut dark blue silk with a fine light blue irregular check.\nBacking: pieced; green satin.\nEmbroidery Thread: 2S silk; black [outlines], shades of red sometimes faded to pink, yellow, light blue, blue, dark blue, green, white, pale grey, greenish-beige, light brown.",
