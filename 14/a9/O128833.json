Objects cast from a zinc alloy are then decorated in silver and when finished, briefly covered in a saline mud. When the mud is removed, the surface of the dull grey alloy has been changed to a matt black by means of a chemical process which is still not understood. The silver remains unchanged. \nThe huqqa base is decorated with the initials, family crest and motto of William Kelso, who served in the Madras Army from 1803 until his retirement in 1833. It was probably made for him towards the end of his service.",
