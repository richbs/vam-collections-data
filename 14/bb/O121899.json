He was probably a pupil of his father and of Jan Wynants. He painted mainly landscapes with prominent figures and animals, and he often painted the figures and animals in the landscapes of other artists, such as Jacob van Ruisdael and Philips Koninck. \n\nFollower of Adriaen van de VELDE \n\n357 \nLANDSCAPE WITH SPORTSMEN SHOOTING \nOak panel \n13 \u00bd X 10 (34 X 25.4) \nTownshend Bequest \n1378-1869\n\nWaagen attributed this painting to A. van de Velde when he saw it in the Rev. C. H. Townshend's drawing room in 1854 or '56. This attribution is no longer acceptable, but it appears to be a 17th century work in the style of A. van de Velde. \n\nCondition.

He worked in France for several years, but returned to Amsterdam after a brief period in Antwerp. Frederik was strongly influenced by the work of the second generation of Dutch italianates, particularly Asselijn and Jan Both. Several different artists, including Adriaen van de Velde (1636-1672) provided staffage (figures) for his paintings. De Moucheron\u2019s work is appreciated primarily for its picturesque, decorative qualities, the atmospheric quality of his paintings conveyed through use of silvery touches -such as the way the light strikes the tree on the left of 1378-1869. Further, feather-like trees such as this, shown blowing in the wind with the light coming from the right are all signatures of Moucheron's work. The weak execution of the work suggests that it is not by the master's hand but it is very likely a contemporary work in his style.",

More recently,  Marijke de Kinkelder has suggested (written communication, March 2010)  based on photographs only that this work may be a contemporary copy after a co-operation between Frederik de Moucheron (landscape) and Adriaen van de Velde (figures).", 
            "historical_context_note": "Dutch Italianate landscapes such as this were particularly popular in the 17th through to the early 19th centuries. The term conventionally refers to the school of Dutch painters and draughtsmen who were active in Rome for more than a hundred years. These artists produced mainly pastoral subjects bathed in warm southern light, set in an Italian, or specifically Roman, landscape. The term is also often applied, to artists who never left the northern Netherlands but who worked primarily in an Italianate style. Eighteenth-century collectors, especially French ones, preferred a view by Nicolaes Berchem or Jan Both to a scene of the Dutch country side by Jacob van Ruisdael for instance. The taste for the Italianates continued undiminished into the 19th century. An early voice denouncing these artists was that of John Constable in 1836 and at the end of the century Italianates had lost favour partly because of the rise of Impressionism and the appreciation of the Dutch national school of landscape expounded by such eminent critics as Wilhem von Bode, E.W. Moes and Cornelis Hofstede de Groot.",
