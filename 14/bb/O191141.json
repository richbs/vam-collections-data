The slogan 'The workers should be the owners' was adopted by the party on the suggestion of a group of left-wing intellectuals who had opposed the communist regime from a socialist standpoint. The concept of giving shares to workers and employers is closely connected with the idea of self-government, or 'direct democracy'.  As debates about privatization began, the state gave equal consideration to managers and workers over the issue of shares. Workers were represented by the worker's councils which were, however, gradually replaced by trade unions. The trade unions did not represent the case for workers' shares, and the introduction of the policy stopped. \n\nThe photomontage by Bea Farkas is intended to create an atmosphere of modernity and developed industry and to convey the joy of work. The figures in the photo are workers deeply absorbed in their task. The composition of the abstract forms in the background creates an interesting visual effect and recalls the miniature lines of computer chips.",
