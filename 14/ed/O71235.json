This was a common device added by potters who didn't know how to write properly. The dish is of a type that was widely exported in a range of qualities to other Asian countries and to Europe.\n\nTime\nThis dish was made during the reign of the Kangxi Emperor (1662-1722). The pattern recurs on later export wares, including examples salvaged from shipwrecks of mid-18th-century date. It was also copied at several English potteries.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThis dish was made from hard-paste porcelain at one of the kilns in the huge porcelain manufacturing centre of Jingdezhen in Jiangxi Province in central southern China. Decoration in cobalt blue painted under the glaze was a technique commonly used at Jingdezhen from the 14th century onwards. It was a relatively easy way of decorating porcelain and was cheaper than using coloured enamels over the glaze.",
