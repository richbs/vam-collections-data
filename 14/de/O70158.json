            "public_access_description": "This figure is one of a pair representing the Coronation of the Virgin. The pair was separated at some time after 1905. The figure of Christ is now in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. The seated Virgin turns and looks towards Christ, who once sat beside her. The scene is frozen at the moment just after Christ has placed the small crown on the Virgin\u2019s head. It would have been set at the centre of an altarpiece, flanked by Apostles and possibly other saints.\n\nThe scene of the Coronation of the Virgin first appeared in the middle of the 1100s. It celebrates the Virgin\u2019s status as the Queen of Heaven. Representations of it became increasingly widespread as the Virgin\u2019s popularity grew. Devotion to her was connected with her perceived powers of intercession on behalf of sinners. She also had a particular appeal for women, especially mothers. Numerous churches and cathedrals were dedicated to the Virgin between the 1100s and the 1300s. A sculpture of the Coronation often appears above their entrances. \n\nThis figure gives some idea of the original opulence of much medieval sculpture. It is true that the painted decoration has been abraded and lost in places. But enough remains to show the refined painting technique and the love of surface enrichment. The Virgin\u2019s face is painted especially delicately. Her draperies are adorned by raised gesso and inlaid decoration of false gems. The oval hollow in her chest probably once contained a relic covered by rock crystal.",
