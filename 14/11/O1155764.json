It has a loose a-line shape with some small gathered pleats at the front and the back centres of the dress that attach to the yoke and hang above what would be the bust line.\n\nThe neckline to the brown fabric is finished off with the pale pink trim / hem with a button fastening at the back of the neck.\n\nThe dress has a Nixie Clothing label, pale blue with gold stitched butterfly and words on the inside back of neck.",
