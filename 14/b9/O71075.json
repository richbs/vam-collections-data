            "public_access_description": "This is a cord-wrapped slung sword (\u2018Ito-maki-no tachi\u2019). The tachi is a sword with a blade length normally longer than 60 centimetres, carried with the cutting edge down. The scabbard of this example is decorated in lacquer of the type known as \u2018nashiji\u2019, which has a pear-skin appearance. It is decorated with arabesque scrolling and the paulownia leaf crest, the paulownia plant being associated with the ruling Tokugawa shoguns of the Edo period (1600-1868). The metal fittings are all from the Goto School and are made of shakudo (an alloy of gold and copper patinated to a rich black colour) inlaid with gold. The section of the scabbard near the suspension cords is wrapped with silk brocades to prevent abrasion of the expensive lacquer when the sword is worn with full armour. This style of slung sword mounting, with decoration of family badges, was worn only by senior samurai. This example was probably assembled around 1850.\n\nThe tachi blade is signed \u2018Bishu Osafune Morimitsu\u2019 from the late 14th century. This is an excellent example of a blade of this period from Bizen province. It has elegant graining along the blade, which comes from the folding process in the manufacture of the sword. The tempered edge of the blade, which has been heavily shortened (perhaps by as much as 10 centimetres), has a strong undulating wavy pattern of clove flowers (\u2018gunome choji-hamon\u2019). \n\nThe sword is from the collection of Sir Claude MacDonald, who was British ambassador to Japan from 1905 to 1912. He had a particular interest in swords. According to V&A records, this blade was given to him by \u2018Prince Katsura\u2019. Sir Claude\u2019s widow, Lady Ethel MacDonald, later gave the V&A four splendid swords.",
