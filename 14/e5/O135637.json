            "physical_description": "Four short legs of black japanned wood, turned as ribbed balls at the bottom then widening out as cylinders at which stage they are hidden by a black framework which depends from the main base of the canterbury; base and framework are of wood, japanned black.  The edge of the base which projects beyond the frame as a moulding has a gilt zig-zag ribbon decoration around its top. The next stage has a convex profile and is decorated all round with swags of gilt leaves and mother of pearl flowers overpainted in colours.  This stage appears to have a wooden base with papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 facing; at the front it incorporates a single wide drawer with two mother of pearl knobs.  The drawer and its framing are of black japanned wood.  The top of this drawer stage has a moulded edge decorated on top with a band of gold speckling inlaid at random with fragments of mother of pearl, partly painted in colours, between two painted silver lines.  The rack section of the canterbury is formed of four papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 plates.  That at the front has a fret-cut edge with scrollwork and leaf ornament around its border.  This ornament is built up and decorated with random mother of pearl inlay, gilt leaves and foliate ornament partly painted green.  The main field of the plate is decorated with a central group of flowers painted naturalistically in colours partly over mother of pearl inlay.  Around this central group is scrolled foliate ornament combined with naturalistic flowers mainly gilt but also painted in colours and inlaid with mother of pearl.  This surrounding ornament connects with the raised decorative border ornament.  The central two plates have a similar fret-cut profile to the front one but have no other decoration than a narrow band of gilt scroll-work on their edges and top.  The back plate has the same profile but is decorated on the centre of its outward face with a group of flowers naturalistically painted in colours, partly over mother of pearl inlay.  The four plates are connected on each side by three turned wooden spindles; each with a broad knop in the centre with a band of gilt zig-zag ribbon decoration.  At back and front these spindles project through the outside plates as raised and moulded circular bosses decorated with bands of gilding.",

It became popular in Britain during the 18th century when the term was first coined in English (whereas in French the term was not recognized until the 20th century). At first it was used in pulp form for architectural mouldings and frames. As technology progressed a technique of moulding laminated sheets of paper was developed. The durable waterproof nature of this material meant it could be used for anything from trays, boxes and screens to chairs, pianos and even carriages. \n\nUnlike wood, papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 was not prone to warping which could cause painted decoration to crack, or inlay to lift.  It was therefore ideally suited to the decorative techniques of japanning, gilding and pearl inlay found on this canterbury or music book stand.  The durability of some forms of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 meant that it could be cut, joined and inlaid like wood, but complex items were usually made up of a combination of wood and papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 components.  Here the base, its drawer and legs are of wood, while the dividing panels above are papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9.",
