At this time homeowners became interested in decorating their houses in styles that reflected the age of the building. A drawing room in a London townhouse would have looked like this round about the 1850s. The luxurious style, with heavy draperies, rich accessories and plump upholstery draws on French 18th century fashions, and the court style of 16th century Italy. The wallpaper is a classic pink and white stripe, in the style often known as 'Regency stripe'.",

London, 2002. pp. 142. pl 127.\nAn excerpt of the entry is as follows:\n\n'This decorative scheme, in a sumptuous <i>grande luxe</i> style, draws on a range of historical precedents, predominantly French 18th-century fashions, and the court style of 16th-century Italy. The wallpaper is a classic pink and white stripe, in the style often known as 'Regency stripe'. This entire scheme, including the wallpaper, is characteristic of the taste for historicising styles in later 20th-century interior decoration. Here the look is appropriate to the interior of a mid-19th-century London townhouse. The 1980s saw a new interest in decorating in a style sympathetic to the age of the house, though the degree of period detail and authenticity varied.'",
