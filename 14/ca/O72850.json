            "public_access_description": "Byzantine ivory plaques of this type, originally serving as icons or parts of diptychs, were brought to Italy in large numbers and often reused as book covers. The scenes depicted here are the Annunciation, the Nativity, the Transfiguration, the Raising of Lazarus, the Maries at the Sepulchre and the Meeting in the Garden.\nOriginally the plaque might have been part of  a diptych. If this is the case, it is clear that the plaque was later reused. Both lateral borders were shaved down to reduce the width of the plaque and perhaps to eliminate the hinge holes on the right side. It is probable that the plaque was employed as a book-cover, probably on a western manuscript. Judging by the wear at the upper right and the flattening effect of the abrasion to the upper arm of the apostle behind Christ in the Raising of Lazarus scene, it would seem likely that it served as the back cover. One might expect that the now-missing right leaf was set into the front cover.",

Both lateral borders were shaved down to reduce the width of the plaque and perhaps to eliminate the hinge holes on the right side. It is probable that the plaque was employed as a book-cover, probably on a western manuscript. Judging by the wear at the upper right and the flattening effect of the abrasion to the upper arm of the apostle behind Christ in the Raising of Lazarus scene, it would seem likely that it served as the back cover. One might expect that the now-missing right leaf was set into the front cover.",

In this group compositions tend to be crowded with comparatively small-scale figures, their heads seen in almost full profile but with features carved on the steeply cut concealed side.",
