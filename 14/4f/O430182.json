It was bought by Dr John Forbes Watson for 5d and given by him in 1871 to the Art Museum, later renamed the Victoria and Albert Museum.\nJohn Forbes Watson (1827-1892) was a physician who began his career in the Bombay Army Medical Service in 1850. He became Director of the Indian Museum in London in 1858, and was later commissioned to catalogue and investigate useful plants of India, publishing an index in 1868. He selected the materials for the Indian department of the London International Exhibition in 1862, and wrote the catalogue. He became part of Henry Cole's circle at the South Kensington Museum and subsequently played a major role in Britain's contributions to major international exhibitions. He reorganised the Indian Museum in 1870, and spent much of his career trying to promote commerce between England and India. He retired in 1880, soon after the Indian Museum was relocated and its collections dispersed.",
