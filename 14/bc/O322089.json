They were fitted with eight single strings, either gut or wire, and an additional seven unstopped strings in the bass. This instrument was popular in Sweden between about 1780 and 1820, and was mostly played in domestic settings. After the lifting of a sixty-year ban on the import of foreign musical instruments in 1816, the Swedish theorbo was superceded by the six-string Spanish guitar, which was far easier to tune and play.",
