            "public_access_description": "David Bowie is one of the most influential musicians of the last five decades. He is an innovator, with a distinctive voice and intellectual depth. His major breakthrough came with the single Space Oddity in 1969, but this merchandise is from his glam period as  Ziggy Stardust. The image on the scarf is from the cover of his 1973 album Aladdin Sane and the lightning flash make-up on his face is synonymous with the singer.\n\nWith t-shirts becoming a staple fashion item for youth and rock 'n' rollers in the 1960s, promotional t-shirts and sweat shirts printed to advertise products also became common place. This trend moved from corporate arena to youth movement with the merging of rock 'n' roll, advertising and fashion into the creation of the concert t-shirt, of which this is an example. Not only does it advertise a concert the wearer has been to, but concert and band t-shirts/ sweat shirts can also show the wearer's allegiance to specific musical subcultures or youth movements.",
