Note: researchers may use the terms applique and tambour when searching for this category of textile even though they are incorrect.\nPieced, seams go through the embroidery. On the left hand side there are the remains of a red cotton binding.  A section of the resht  work has been folded to the back  and tacked in place and the fold has then been cut along its length; the binding has been sewn onto the top of this.\nThe pattern is a series of horizontal bands.  From the bottom:\n[1] black band\n[2] orange ground with red leaves and white embroidery forming an undulating line either side of which are black rosettes or green or blue star shaped flowers with red berries and green tracery.\n[3] red band\n[4] Deep band.  Black ground with thick white embroidered meander with large, composite, multi-coloured blossoms and red and yellow pointed flowers and round flower; there are light blue leaves and lots of small white tendrils.\n[5] red band\n[6] as [2]\n[7] black band\n[8] pieced; red ground with seven and a half left-facing botehs.  Dark petals at the base and at the top with blue, purple and turquoise flowers and many white tendrils.\nThe seams are covered with red and white silk with a line of black and white silk between bands [7] and [8].\nEmbroidery thread: 2S silk: green, red, white, light blue, yellow.\nInset wool: black, red, orange, turquoise, dark blue, grey, light blue, purple.",
