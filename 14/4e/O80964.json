Apprenticed to a publisher 1808, received a few lessons in painting from Thomas Sully. A subscription was raised to enable him to study art in Europe; returned.to London 1811, entered RA Schools and studied with Benjamin West and Washington Allston. Visited Paris 1817 with Allston and Wilkie Collins, met G S Newton, with whom he visited Brussels and Antwerp. Also friend and biographer (published 1843) of John Constable. Exhibited 76 works at the RA between 1813 and 1859, and 11 at the BI 1815-32. Some were portraits, but most were his much admired literary subjects, particularly drawn from Cervantes, Moliere, Shakespeare and Steme. Elected ARA 1821, RA 1826. Several of his works were engraved, and he made six illustrations for Sir WaIter Scott's Waverley novels 1824. Worked for six months as drawing master at West Point Military Academy, New York State, 1833. Professor of Painting at RA 1848-52; his lectures were published as a <U>Handbook for Young Painters</u> (1855). His <u>Life of Reynolds</u> was finished by Tom Taylor and published 1865. Died St John's Wood, London, 5 May 1859. An exhibition at the RA of  30 of his works was held winter 1870. His two sons, George Dunlop and Robert, were also artists. The <u>Athenaeum </u>critic (9 May 1846, p480) wrote that he was 'unrivalled for the certainty of his powers, the <i>wi</i>t of his pencil, the deep knowledge of human nature as exhibited in the more ordinary scenes of life'.\n\nLIT: <u>Art JournaI</u>1856, pp73-5 and 105-7, 1859, p187 (obit); C R Leslie <u>Autobiographical Recollections</u> ed T Taylor, 2 vols, 1860; J Dafforne <u>Pictures by C R Leslie </u> nd [1875]; <u>Art ]ournaI</u>1902, pp 144-8; J Constable <u>The Letters of John Constable and C R Leslie</u> 1931; ed R B Beckett John <u>Constable's Correspondence</u> III, Ipswich 1965 \n\n\n<b>Portia</b> \nFA127 Neg 74355 \nPanel, oval, 25.4 X 20.3 cm (10 X 8 ins) \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \nTitled 'Portia' since its acquisition, and with the following quotation appended in the 1907 catalogue: 'Oh me, the word \"choose\"! I may neither choose whom I would, nor refuse whom I dislike; so is the will of living daughter curb'd by the will of a dead father'. \nThe lines are from Shakespeare's <i>The Merchant of Venice</i> act 1 scene 2. \nHowever, Ashton, surely correctly, doubts this subject, as the classical costume is so inappropriate, and suggests that Portia, the wife of Brutus, in <i>Julius Caesar</i> as a possible identification. He dates the work about 1848. Ashton also compares the pose, costume, hairstyle and other details, with those of the engraving after John Hayter's 'Helena' in Charles Heath's 'The Shakespeare Gallery ... ' (1836-7). The Hayter depicts the Helena of <i>All's Well That Ends Well</i>, but Ashton proposes the Helen of Shakespeare's <i>Troilus and Cressida.</i> Another possibility is the Athenian Helena of A<i> Midsummer Night's Dream. </i>\nThe work seems to be a companion to 'Griselda' (see FAl28 below), and represents the same model (see also FAl25, pl72).\nEXH:\t<i>Shakespeare's Heroines </i>Buxton Museum and Art Gallery 1980 (18, as 'Helen')\nENGR: Unknown artist (impr in V&A, 18876), also from the Sheepshanks collection)\nLIT: <u>Shakespeares Heroines</u> Buxton Museum and Art Gallery exhibition catalogue 1980, p40 (repr) \n\n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
