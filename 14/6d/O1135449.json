Meyer only filmed for three days on the project before leaving, but these images were used in the single artwork for Who Killed Bambi?, the double A-side with Silly Thing released in March 1979. The dead deer was photographed in many situations but the photograph was eventually only used on the promotional poster printed in the Melody Maker music newspaper.\n\nJamie Reid's cut-and-paste aesthetic developed from his interest in radical politics. His artistic style developed while at art college in Croydon, where he was influenced by the ideas of the avant-garde political group, the Situationist International. The political slant to his art was aroused by the May 1968 Paris student riots, which inspired fraternal protests organised by Reid at the Croydon College of Art. These were directed with fellow student Malcolm McLaren, who would later become the manager of the Sex Pistols.",
