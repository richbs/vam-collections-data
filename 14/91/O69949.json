            "public_access_description": "This fine rock crystal piece must have been a container of some sort. Its complex shape can be seen as the body of a fish. Two convex faces are joined at an angle along the sides, which taper gently towards the base, or tail. However, the fish shape does not continue at the top, where the angled sides broaden out into shoulders. At the centre these form a collar around the mouth of the hollowed out interior. Another hole was later drilled into the bottom to take a mount. \nThe outside has elegant decoration carved in relief to stand proud of the surface. At the edges of each face there are pairs of hatched bands. Two pairs of complex volutes spring from the bands to fill much of the central field. Four palmettes hang downwards from the collar. Two lie on the shoulders and two extend into the top of each face. The remaining space is filled with abstract decoration based on two lozenges with curved sides. We know that high-quality rock crystal vessels with decoration of this type were made for the rulers of Egypt during the Fatimid period (969-1171). This piece was made between 1000 and 1050.",
