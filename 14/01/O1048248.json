However, after her husband succeeded to his title in 1856 they were apparently able to afford a governess. The increase in her free time brought about by this may have been one of the factors in Lady Hawarden's decision to take up photography. In this photograph her daughter embraces an unidentified young woman, who to judge by her appearance and the activities in which she appears engaged in other photographs, for instance Ph 457-1968:560 (D.311) and Ph 457-1968:328 (D.312), may have been the governess. Lady Hawarden's photographs of this young woman present someone whose situation seems markedly different from the lonely and isolated young women of Victorian genre paintings such as Richard Redgrave's The Governess (1844). Though Lady Hawarden's attitude to this young woman is unrecorded except in photographs, family correspondence reveals that she and her sisters enjoyed a close relationship with their own governess, to whom they remained devoted for many years.In this photograph her daughter embraces an unidentified young woman, who to judge by her appearance and the activities in which she appears engaged in other photographs, for instance Ph 457-1968:560 (D.311) and Ph 457-1968:328 (D.312), may have been the governess.
