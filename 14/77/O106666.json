As a punishment, Diana turned him into a stag and he was killed by his own hounds.\n\nFranceso Fanelli (1577- ca. 1641) was first documented in Genoa in 1608, where, until about 1631, he produced religious works in marble, silver, ivory and bronze. By 1635, he was working at the English court. Although he described himself 'sculptor to the King of Great Britain', it is unclear whether this title was officially conferred. The V&A owns versions of several small bronzes listed in an inventory of Whitehall Palace in 1639 as by 'ffrancisco the one-eyed Italian'. George Vertue, an eighteenth century art critic, stated that Fanelli 'livd and dyd in England'; he is last documented in 1641 and believed to have died soon after.",
