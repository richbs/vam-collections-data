It may well have been intended to be displayed on the chimneypiece of a private house. As it is made in lead, a reproductive material, more than one version might have been cast, but this is the only one known. The artist, too, is unknown, although it was perhaps someone working in the circle of Henry Cheere (1703-1781) or that of his brother John. John Cheere (1709-1787) specialised in lead sculpture, and Henry Cheere seems to have produced a number of busts in this material. The sensitive modelling and informal costume (a soft cap, unbuttoned shirt and loose robe) would also support an attribution to an artist working in the orbit of the Cheere brothers.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThis bust was cast in lead, almost certainly from an original model in clay or terracotta (literally 'baked clay'). A mould would have been taken from the model, and used to reproduce it in lead. Lead being a relatively soft metal, the softness of the original modelling is clearly seen here. No other versions of this bust are known, although sometimes copies of portrait busts were made from the original version on a monument.",
