Formed in 1966 by david Queensberry, then Professor of Ceramics at the RCA, and his former student Martin hunt. the partnership have designed ceramics for major producers and retailers around the globe. these include Wedgewood, Hornsea, Rosenthal, Habitat, Crate and Barrel, John Lewis and Jamie Oliver. Their practice spans a period of immense change in the industry, brought about by the adoption of new technologies, and the shift in production towards East Asia. Working in an essentially modernist aesthetic, Queensberry Hunt have been responsible for some of the most familiar and best-selling tableware of recent decades.\nDeveloped for production at Hornsea\u2019s new factory in Lancaster, \u2018Contrast\u2019 became the firm\u2019s best selling oven-to-tableware range world-wide. The design emphasised the chocolate brown \u2018Vitramic\u2019 body created by Colin Rawson, the clay being vitrified in a high-temperature firing and polished to pebble-like smoothness. The polishing was achieved by vibrating the pieces in containers loaded with ceramic pellets. The range won a Design Council Award in 1975.",
