UNFINISHED PETTICOAT\nHand-knitted two-ply worsted\nDutch, 17th to early 18th century.\n\nThe raised pattern of animals, birds and flowering trees is finely knitted in purl and combinations of plain and purl stitches against a stocking stitch ground. The petticoat was worked in the round (there are no seams) and has a circumference of 312 cms: the pattern does not repeat.\n\nThe attribution of this piece to Holland is traditional - the Dutch were known for the excellence of their knitting. A comparable petticoat knitted in cotton, with a lattice pattern incorporating the date 1722, appeared recently in a London sales room.\n\nBequeathed by Lt. Col. G.B.Croft Lyons FSA\nT.177-1926"

The petticoat was worked in the round (there are no seams) and has a circumference of 312 cms: the pattern does not repeat.\n\nThe attribution of this piece to Holland is traditional - the Dutch were known for the excellence of their knitting. A comparable petticoat knitted in cotton, with a lattice pattern incorporating the date 1722, appeared recently in a London sales room.\n\nBequeathed by Lt. Col.

It seems too large to have been produced by hand or on a knitting frame. The only other similar garment was a petticoat knitted in a variety of abstract patterns within a diamond-shaped grid. Sold at Christies auction house in 1981, it too dated from the early 18th century and had both Dutch and English connections.\n\nThe cream-coloured petticoat is knitted in two-ply wool, with surface decoration of animals, birds and trees. Among the more exotic creatures are an elephant, a lion, an ostrich and a rhinoceros. The motifs are knitted in purl and plain on a background of stocking stitch. \n\nThe petticoat is knitted in the round with no seams and has a circumference of over 3 metres at the widest point. Despite the large surface area, the pattern does not repeat.",
