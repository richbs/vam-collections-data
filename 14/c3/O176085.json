            "public_access_description": "This is the plaster model by Boehm for the figure of the 42nd Royal Highlander for the Wellington Monument. The Monument to Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington at Hyde Park Corner was unveiled on 21st Decmber 1888 by the Prince of Wales. The monument had been commissioned as part of the re-design of Hyde Park Corner which had begun in 1883.\n\nSir Joseph Edgar Boehm (1834-1890) was an English sculptor and medallist born in Austrian, as the youngest son of Joseph Daniel Boehm (1794\u20131865), a court medallist and director of the Imperial Mint at Vienna. From 1848 to 1851 Joseph Edgar attended Leigh\u2019s art academy (later Heatherley\u2019s) in London and drew the Parthenon marbles in the British Museum. On his return to Vienna he enrolled at the Akademie der Bildenden K\u00fcnste. Around 1858\u20139 he visited Italy, where he developed a lasting admiration for early Renaissance sculpture. From 1859 to 1862 he worked in Paris and was influenced by the work of Paul Gayrard (1807\u20131855). Boehm settled in London in 1862 where he befriended John Leech and John Everett Millais, both of whom he portrayed in statuettes in 1863. A statuette of William Makepeace Thackeray (1864) led to an edition of 70 plaster casts. Boehm frequently worked in terracotta, a material common in French sculpture but less familiar in English. Queen Victoria\u2019s admiration of Boehm\u2019s statuettes led to an association with the royal family that lasted from 1869 until his death. Most of Boehm\u2019s works are portrait busts. Boehm was immensely prolific: some 360 different works are documented. He was a highly consistent sculptor, rarely deviating from his brand of realism. He was modest about his immense popularity and aware of his imaginative shortcomings (cit.: M. Stocker: 'Boehm, Joseph Edgar').\n\nArthur Wellesley (1769-1852), later the 1st Duke of Wellington, was Britain's greatest military commander. His brilliant tactics and leadership brought about major victories over the French in the Peninsular War of 1808-1814 and, most famously, at Waterloo on 18 June 1815. The Duke then became a politician (Prime Minister from 1828-1830) and distinguished elder statesman. In gratitude for his defeat of Napoleon, European sovereigns showered the Duke with spectacular gifts, notably paintings, porcelain and silver. These form the core of the art collection still at his London home, Apsley House on Hyde Park Corner. The house was originally designed by Robert Adam but was enlarged for the Duke by Benjamin Dean Wyatt. It was presented to the Nation with its contents in 1947, the family retaining apartments.",
