The shadow of her body on the wall pushes back in reply.\n\nThis dramatic photograph has other parallels in Lady Hawarden\u2019s work. When exhibiting her photographs she described them simply as \u2018Photographic Studies\u2019 or \u2018Studies from Life\u2019. The \u2018study\u2019 suggests a work that is not finished or complete, but preparatory. Photographs such as this one may make use of that provisional status to try out a pose and an effect of light. They do not aspire to completeness of composition and fully formed expression.\n\nHawarden\u2019s contemporary, the photographer Oscar Rejlander, made a large tableau in 1857 from many photographs printed together. He called it The Two Ways of Life. He exhibited the individual figure studies separately. Perhaps Lady Hawarden gained a certain artistic freedom from the idea of the \u2018Study\u2019. In gesture and lighting, her photographs are more freely inventive than those of most other photographers of her time.",

Microfilm: 3.19.337 The Golden Age of British Photography (travelli exhibition), Victoria and Albert Museum, 1984-8 Pre-Raphaelite Photography (travelling exhibition), Manchester City Art Gallery, 1986- Because Lady Hawarden concentrated on photographing her daughters in and around their home to the near exclusion of other subjects and settings after 1859, casual modern-day observers have concluded that she was something of a mysterious recluse. However, her family and friends did not describe her as withdrawn. Rejlander found her 'straightforward'\u2022 [a.G. R(ejlander), 'In Memoriam', British Journal of Photography, 12:38 (27 January 1865).] It has also recently been suggested that her work is in keeping with the mid-Victorian preoccupation with the conflicts between interior and exterior or between the haves and the have-nots. Here the distraught and yearning attitude of Clementina's outstretched arms is reinforced by the proximity of a closed window. To one modern observer, Lady Hawarden's photographs of such scenes are a 'full expression of introversion and desired escape from the wallpapered rooms and French windows imprisoning [her] sitters. I [Elizabeth Anne McCauley, Likenesses: Portrait Photography in Europe 1850-1870, Albuquerque, New Mexico 1981, 51.]--However, it seems clear when Lady Hawarden's work is considered as a whole that notions of introversion or imprisonment are far from her intended meaning.
