            "bibliography": "Kauffmann, C. M., <u>Catalogue of Foreign Paintings, vol. I before 1800</u> London, V & A, 1973, no. 124, pp. 111-112.\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\nFlorentine School, (?) 15th century \n\n124 \nCASSONE, PAINTED WITH: \nfront: TRIUMPHS OF LOVE, CHASTITY AND DEATH \nsides: NARCISSUS AND ECHO; PYRAMUS AND THISBE; \ninside lid: A SLEEPING NUDE WOMAN\nTempera on panel \nH. 37 (94); L. 85 (216); W. 31 (78.7). \n4639-1858 (F. & W.)\n\nThe paintings on this cassone were originally attributed, like so many others, to Dello Delli; Schiaparelli (1908) placed them in his last group of cassoni in the style of Pesellino, while Schubring (1915) gave the front to the 'Cassone Master' and the side and top panels to the Paris Master. Yet it is so completely repainted that it seems unwise to attempt an attribution to a particular workshop. Indeed, the possibility that it is altogether a 19th century work should not be excluded. \nThe three triumphs follow closely in the tradition of Petrarch illustrations - deriving ultimately from classical triumphs - as it had become established in the first half of the 15th century (see no. 123). The same three Triumphs out of the original six appear in a cassone formerly in the Landau collection, Florence (Schubring, 1915, no. 207), which also has the same compositions on the side panels and on the lid.\nThe scene of Narcissus falling in love with his own image occurs frequently in late 14th and 15th century book illumination in mss. of  <i>Ovide Moralis\u00e9</i> and of the <i>Roman de la Rose</i>. A similar composition appears on a cassone in the Lanckoronski collection, Vienna (Schubring, 1915, no. 173, pl. xxxvi) but this does not include Echo, who is here shown bemoaning the fate of her beloved. \nThe story of Pyramus and Thisbe, another example of doomed love, is also illustrated in <i>Ovide Moralis\u00e9</i> mss.; and partners that of Narcissus on several other cassoni. Curiously enough, this composition reverses the events of the story: in fact it was Pyramus who killed himself first, in the belief that Thisbe had been devoured by a lion, and then Thisbe followed suit when she found his corpse. This misunderstanding can only strengthen the doubts already raised concerning this work. \nSchubring attempted to identify the sleeping woman as (?) Helen of Troy but Schiaparelli's description of her as a <i>transparente e realistica allusione alla sposa</i> seems much more acceptable. The inside lids of a pair of cassoni in Lord Crawford's collection (Schubring, 1915, nos. 156-57, pl. xxx) show the figures of a naked woman and a clothed man, presumably intended to represent the bride and bridegroom. Similar figures occur on the inside lids of other cassoni published by Schubring (nos. 289-90) and by Borenius (1929). E. H. Gombrich has interpreted these figures as auguries of fertility (<i>J. W. C. I.,</i> xviii, 1955, p. 18). \n\nCondition. Much repainted. \nProv. Bought by the Museum in 1858 for \u00a380. \nLit. J. H.

CXX (1984), no.272 pp.246-251, fig. 6.\n\"Forziere (?) ...The much-restored painted panel shows the Triumphs of Love, Chastity and Death. Such panels painted with scenes (storiato) have often been removed from their original mounts to masquerade as pictures for hanging on the wall. This object was assembled, probably with new wood-work, in the nineteenth century. Presumably the restorers based their work on original models. In this case, this may have been what was referred to in one inventory as a 'forziere al'anticha grande storiato'.\nPaul Schubring, <u>Cassoni; truhen und truhenbilder der italienischen fr\u00fchrenaissance. ein beitrag zur profanmalerei im quattrocento</u> Leipzig, K.W.

Actually Pyramus dies before Thisbe.\n2.\tNarcissi loses him self when he looks at the picture that the water reflects of him. \u2026..   Ovid Metamorphosis III, 407ff.\n\nIn Sabattini degli Arientis \" novelle Porretane\"( first print 1483) in novel no IX you have Leila in pain because of her love Malatesta de' Corbonesi, whom her parents have killed, so she decides to kill her self, with  the same strong will as Thisbe.\n\nThe two side panels are not from the same crafts man as the front, but maybe from the same atelier, so similar to the Frescobaldi trunk.\nThe front piece of the trunk is most of the time done by the master/ capo of the workshop/ bottega. - two scenes of killing love.   \nThe theme inside ( kat. Nr. 185) is from the same craftsmen.\n\n185. London, Victoria & Albert Museum 1858, 4639.    Plate XXXVIII\n\nSleeping naked women (Helena?). Inside of Nr. 207\nThe Paris-master\n\nOn a red and golden pillow lies the naked body of Helena, her front body is facing the side of the viewer, and she is sleeping. Golden brocade ground. She has a golden Alice band shining in her hair. 46 little mousetraps are decorating the boundary. \n\nThe Painter is a different one then on the front Picture, but he has done also the side panels, no,170, 171\nPlate in Schiaparelli 1.c, S 274.\n\n207. London, Victoria & Albert Museum 1858, 4639 \nbig state trunk. On the front: Triforno dell Amore, della Castita, della morte, strongly overpainted/ repainted.\n\nThe Cassone-Master\n\nLeft the carriage of amor, drawn be four horses, 28 companions most of them men. A tree marks the border between the Kingdom of Castitas, who drives with a triumph to the right side, showing her back to amor who is tied up on her wagon, the wagon is surrounded by 14 girls. Also on the right side but coming from the far right there is la Morte on his Taurus, his scythe in front of him. She is screaming scornful to the young happy crowd. This depiction is very similar to the Trifoni Pesellinos.\n\nWith this front  you have the side panels Nr . 170, 171 and the picture of the inside depicting the naked sleeping women Nr. 185.  so if this all goes together you can see the work of the Cassone-master as well as the Paris-master on one object working together. The naked women on the inside of the top would presume the counterpart with the other three trifoni of Petrarca ( Fama , Tempus,Divinitas)\nJ. H.

They were generally made on the occasion of a relatively important wedding and contained the bride's trousseau. Writing in the mid-sixteenth century, Vasari describes <i>cassoni</i> thus:\n\n'\u2026citizens of those times used to have in their apartments great wooden chests in the form of a sarcophagus, with the covers shaped in various fashions\u2026and besides the stories that were wrought on the front and on the ends, they used to have the arms, or rather, insignia, of their houses painted on the corners, and sometimes elsewhere. And the stories that were wrought on the front were for the most part fables taken from Ovid and from other poets, or rather stories related by the Greek and Latin historians, and likewise chases, jousts, tales of love, and other similar subjects\u2026'.\n\n(Giorgio Vasari, translated Gaston du C. de Vere, <i>Lives of the Painters, Sculptors and Architects,</i> vol. 1, London 1996, p.267)\n\nThese lavishly decorated <i>cassoni</i>, often combined with pastiglia decoration, were generally commissioned in pairs. Florence, which specialised in the decoration of the front panel, was at that time the main centre of production, even though Siena and the Veneto also supplied <i>cassoni</i>. The painted decorations usually represented episodes from classical or biblical history or mythology appropriate for the newly wed. \nThe most flourishing <i>cassone</i> workshop in Florence was run by Marco del Buono Giamberti and Apollonio di Giovanni but major artists such as Domenico Veneziano and Botticelli may have decorated cassoni on occasion. Painted cassoni went out of fashion towards the end of the 15th century when carved oaken chests came into vogue.",
