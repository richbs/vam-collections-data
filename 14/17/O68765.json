It is in Caulfield's characteristic distinctive style, with thick black outlines used to depict everyday objects. Caulfield is associated with the Pop Art movement, and shares Pop's enthusiasm for the banal and familiar aspects of modern life.   \n\nThis print was a part of a set published by the Space Studios in London in 2002. The book SPACE Cooks  included recipes, some practical and some conceptual, by 103 leading contemporary artists.",
