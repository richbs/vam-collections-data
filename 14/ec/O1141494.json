He has lived in Cornwall (the scene of many family holidays in his childhood) since 1984. Cornish landscapes, especially the coastal landscapes, supply much of his subject matter. He has said \"In Cornwall my subjects are mostly places I know well, that I visit over and over again - certain areas of coastal moor land and valleys. I also work on projects, usually one a year, which are either based on a particular aspect of Cornish culture or on a distinct track of countryside.\"\n\nThis print (and related prints also in the collection, see E.659 to E.662-2009) reflects his central concerns with landscape, in the larger sense of 'views', but also his focus on the details of a place, and the experience of being out of doors, in wild places.",
