They are shown with clothes designed by John McIntyre from fabric by Timney Fowler (they were also new graduates from the Royal College of Art, and exceptionally for degree show material these ensembles were taken by Browns of South Molton Street). Valerie Robertson's jewellery is detailed as being available at Strangeways, 3 Holland Street, a boutique then managed by the donor. The following year Zandra Rhodes commissioned work in a similar style and the same materials for her Spring / Summer Collection 1980 (see Farneti Cera, Deanna <U>Jewels of Fantasy</U> p.349).",
