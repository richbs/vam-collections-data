The light construction and floral decoration suggest that this type of chair was designed for a more feminine setting, such as a drawing room or boudoir.\n\nPeople\nWright and Mansfield were famous for their furniture in 18th century styles. A satinwood cabinet with Wedgwood plaques made by the firm caused a sensation at the International Exhibition in London in 1862. They specialised in furniture based on the designs of Robert Adam, Thomas Chippendale, George Hepplewhite and Thomas Sheraton, whose designs inspired this chair. Their clients included Lord Tweedmouth and the Earl and Countess of Aberdeen. The firm flourished from 1860, firstly at 3 Great Portland Street, and subsequently at 104 New Bond Street, London, where it finally closed in 1886.\n\nTime\nIn 1886 the South Kensington Museum bought a collection of marquetry panels for interior decoration, two small tables and a pair of these chairs from the sale of the stock of Wright and Mansfield. The Museum wanted to show visitors the difference between these examples of good-quality reproduction furniture made in the 1880s and original furniture of the 1780s.",
