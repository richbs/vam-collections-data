It was one of many commemorative items available for sale to visitors of the Great Exhibition. Set in the front is a view of the Crystal Palace reverse-painted under glass; beneath is a silvered layer. This gives a sparkle to the glass of the Palace.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe folder is made of japanned papier-mach\u00e9 decorated with mother-of-pearl roses. The 18th-century craft of japanning ornaments made of papier-mach\u00e9 became an industry after 1772 when Henry Clay of Birmingham invented a new method of manufacture. He pressed sheets of heat-resisting paper into wooden moulds. This was then removed, stoved and smoothed, providing a warp-free surface ideal for japanning. Japanning, in which pigment is suspended in a varnish medium, is a cheap method of imitating oriental lacquer.\n\nHistorical Associations\nMany different papier-mach\u00e9 articles were exhibited at the Crystal Palace. Jennens and Bettridge, who had bought Clay's factory in 1816, had one of the main displays. In 1825, this firm had also registered a patent for mother-of-pearl inlay. Richard Redgrave, the artist who was a member of the jury for prize medals at the Great Exhibition, also selected exhibits for acquisition by the Museum of Ornamental Art.  In his 'Principles of Practical Art' in the Museum's catalogue, he criticised 'papier-mach\u00e9 hidden under a surface of pearl and gold' as an example of over-decoration and declared it a 'ruling vice of the Exhibition'. This was despite his own ventures into ornamental papier-mach\u00e9 design. Indeed, papier-mach\u00e9 tended to become fussier and by the 1860s the industry went into a gradual decline.",
