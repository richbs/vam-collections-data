It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years. Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nMadge Titheradge was born in Australia but made her first stage appearance in London in 1902 as a water baby in The Water Babies at the Garrick Theatre. She played a great number of roles on the London stage including Mimi in Trilby at His Majesty's Theatre and Lisa in Faust at His Majesty's Theatre in 1908.  She became a member of Lewis Waller's company and was Peter Pan at the Duke of York's Theatre in 1914. A versatile actress, she appeared in pantomime at Drury Lane Theatre as well as playing Nora in A Doll's House (1925) and Beatrice in Much Ado About Nothing (1926).",
