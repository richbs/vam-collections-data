Their wealthy owners engaged in few commercial exchanges requiring cash.  In addition to serving as 'sweet bags' or 'gift wrapping', purses sometimes contained mirrors for grooming.  Others functioned as sewing kits, holding needles, thread and tiny scissors.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe purse is made of fine linen canvas and decorated with cross, plait and Gobelin stitches in coloured silk and silver thread.  Two large, pear-shaped tassels of braided silk hold the ends of the drawstrings.\n\nDesigns & Designing\nThe pattern of twisted and interlaced bands resembles strapwork, a style of decoration that originated in France in the 1530s and became popular throughout Northern Europe by the end of the 16th century.  The use of roses and borage flowers, however, is typical of early 17th-century English textile design.",
