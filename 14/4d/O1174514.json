Later he moved on to use a Leica 'reporter' 35mm. His first business was thought to have been in Greenwich area and he worked as a photographer at the Royal Naval college at Greenwich. The National Maritime museum also hold some of his photographs in their collection.\n\nAfter this he began to take seaside photographs in Margate, Broadstairs and Brighton areas where these photographs are all thought to have been taken. Later in his career he moved to South Devon and continued his business, Remington's photo service (later a limited company) in Torquay and Paignton until the late 1950s.",
