His right arm lies across the body with the forefinger extended pointing to the aperture through which the watch dial appears.  His left arm is raised holding a glass; the pose representing a workman in relaxed mood at the end of a working day. The figure sits on the edge of a bench which is scattered with tools, the circular aperture to expose the watch face, immediately below.  Scattered on the floor and to the left of the composition is a jug a wooden bucket and to the right a pair of shoes, a hammer and pieces of leather. The watch would have been supported by a curved channel screwed to the back following in an arc round the base of the aperture (now missing).",
