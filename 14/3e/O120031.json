Llewelyn-Bowen is best known for his appearances on the BBC design make-over television programme Changing Rooms. After studying at Alleyn's School in Dulwich and graduating from Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts in 1986 he went on to work for the Harefield Group of Companies (a specialist manufacturer of industrial flooring and doors) and the interior design firm Peter Leonard Associates. In 1989 Laurence started his own design consultancy and in 1996 he appeared on the first episode of Changing Rooms.  \n\nThe design of this card reflects the flamboyant dandyish style with which he has become associated through his books and television appearances.",
