They performed in Italy for the Medici Court when Callot was working there   recording court entertainment. Dwarfs would have been regarded as amusing, and a troupe dancing and singing would have been a great novelty in the 17th century.\n\nBorn in Nancy, in Lorriane, Jacques Callot studied art and   printmaking in Italy and later worked under the direct   patronage of the Medicis in Florence, where he established his reputation as a fine print artist. Callot was a master of expressing the horrors and joys of 17th century life and was popular all over Europe. He   returned to Nancy in 1621 after the death of Cosimo Medici and is perhaps best known today for the fine series of engravings he executed of Commedia dell'Arte characters, many of whom were also later copied for ceramics.",
