            "public_access_description": "This artwork for a poster by Jamie Reid advertises two gigs by the Sex Pistols at the 100 Club, Oxford Street, London in 1976. The Sex Pistols were booked to perform a series of Tuesday nights during the early days of their existence; this was before they had been signed to a label, but after they had gained media notoriety by swearing on a early evening television show. The band, along with other punk bands, would later be barred from the 100 Club due to violent incidents. They may not have been a part of the incidents, but their entourage, including Sid Vicious, were encouraged by Vivienne Westwood and Malcolm McLaren to live up to the idea of \"total personal freedom\".\n\nJamie Reid's definitive punk style had not been fully developed at this point, although the early stages can be seen in this poster, with the ransom-note band name appearing at the top of the artwork. His cut-and-paste aesthetic, seen in this artwork, developed from his interest in radical politics. His artistic style developed while at art college in Croydon, where he was influenced by the ideas of the avant-garde political group, the Situationist International. The political slant to his art was aroused by the May 1968 Paris student riots, which inspired fraternal protests organised by Reid at the Croydon College of Art. These were directed with fellow student Malcolm McLaren, who would later become the manager of the Sex Pistols.",
