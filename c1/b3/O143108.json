Jainism is one of the oldest religions to have survived until the present time and its basic teaching is one of non-violence.  The Kalpasutra is divided into three sections.   The first section deals with the lives of the twenty-four Jinas or Tirthankaras, who were the Jain spiritual teachers or 'ford-makers'.  The second part deals with the life of Mahavira, the twenty-fourth Tirthankara.  The third part deals with rules for the ascetics and laws during the four months (chaturmas) of the rainy season, when ascetics temporarily abandon their wandering life and settle down amidst the laity. This is the time when the festival of Paryushan is celebrated and the Kalpasutra is traditionally recited.\nThe illustration on the front of this folio shows 'Shoka' or sorrow. Queen Trishala, who was to become mother of Mahavira, is grieving because the embryo has not stirred and she fears the baby has died. She is consoled by a maid servant. On the reverse is another illustration showing Trishala's joy when the embryo quivers and she realises the baby is still alive. Here, dressed in her finery, she looks in her mirror.",
