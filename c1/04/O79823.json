The main purpose of this was to provide examples which would help to improve the design standards of British workers, but wherever possible the curators also recorded information about the origin and purpose of the pieces they acquired.  Although these objects were often bought new at the time, many are now among the oldest surviving examples of their kind, and some are unique survivors of lost patterns of behaviour.\n\nThis little gold filigree clasp was described as Persian when it was acquired by the Museum in 1884, and \u2018used by women to fasten the veil behind the head\u2019.  Without that information it would now be almost impossible to identify with any certainty how it was originally used or even where it was made.",
