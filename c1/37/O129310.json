They originated in the 1440s with the desire to reproduce coins and hardstone engravings from ancient Greece and Rome.  Some were made as collector's pieces, to be viewed and displayed in private, and others for practical or devotional purposes, such as decorations for caskets, ink-stands and paxes.  Belli spent the most important part of his career in Rome, working for two successive popes.  Almost all of his bronze plaquettes are cast from his engravings in rock crystal or hardstone.  The bronze would have been cast from a plaster or brass mould made from an original hardstone engraving.",

The same image exists in Tassie's casts (no.8391) where it is listed as from a (?) rock crystal in a Florentine cabinet.  One of a group of plaquettes of the same subject after Valerio Belli, this plaquette seems to combine elements from the Museum's glass paste version (A.17-1921), and the medal reverse listed in Kris (no.208) in the M\u00fcnzkabinett, Vienna.    It is suggested by Lippert that a version in Berlin is cast from an engraved gem which he ascribes to Belli.  For other versions and discussion see Burns et al, 2000.",
