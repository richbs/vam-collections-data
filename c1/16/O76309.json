Indiana himself has reworked the motif in prints, paintings and sculptures, and it was even used as a design for a U.S. postage stamp. It has also been much imitated and 'quoted' by other artists and designers. It has come to stand as an emblem for the spirit of the 1960s, the era of 'free love' and sexual liberation. The image has the visual impact of an advertising poster or a corporate logo.",

They form part of a portfolio of works by various artists entitled 'R1-67' published on the occasion of the exhibition 'Formen der Farber' [Form in Colour] at the W\u00fcrtembergischer Kunstverein, Bonlanden Bei Stuttgart. Other prints in the portfolio are by: Joseph Albers, Allan D'Arcangelo, Max Bill, Robin Denny, Nicholas Krushenik, Karl Pfaler, Richard Smith, William Turnbull, and Victor Vasarely.\n\nThis suite of four comprises two sets of  duplicates. In the catalogue raisonn\u00e9 (see References tab) they are illustrated as a square block of four, the upper pair mirror images of each other and the lower pair  mirror images of each other, but they also act as mirror images vertically as well as horizontally. However, in order to create this conformation two of the sheets have to be turned upside down. In the V&A prints the duplicate pairs are Circ. 576 and Circ. 579-1968 and Circ 577 and Circ. 578-1968",
