Skill is needed in preparing wet clay to give it strength and ease of modelling, also to remove excess water and air before it is fired in a kiln. Firing fuses the clay particles and causes other structural changes that affect the colour and lead to shrinkage of about 10%. Clay can be modelled by a sculptor to make a unique piece or moulded to produce multiples. Both techniques can be combined to produce one sculpture as in this bust. Here the sculptor has used the two main techniques of working with clay. He modelled the torso but made the head and neck in a mould. Terracotta portrait busts were often made from casts taken in life or after death. In this one the sunken cheeks and reworking around the eyes suggest it was made from a death mask.",
