Westwood\u2019s career in fashion was galvanised by McLaren and together they launched memorable fashion moments, including Punk in the early 1970s and later their Pirates collection. McLaren and Westwood conducted a design relationship between 1971 and 1983. In 1990 and again in 1991 Vivienne Westwood was named British Designer of the Year; she has also received an OBE.\n\nWestwood\u2019s unique mix of practicality and inventiveness, her preoccupation with silhouette and the manner in which she manipulates fabrics result in dynamic fashion. Westwood herself once said, 'You have a much better life if you wear impressive clothes.\u2019 \n\nThis skirt, from Westwood\u2019s \u2018Mini Crini\u2019 collections, reflects Westwood\u2019s career-long fascination with historical dress, and the designer\u2019s interest in incorporating such elements into her work. Westwood\u2019s abbreviated crinoline, made in cottons and lightweight tweeds, combined the historic construction of the original with the short skirt lengths of the modern mini. She rendered them in whimsical prints, such as this large-scale polka dot pattern. Westwood has been quoted as saying about the crini, \u2018It was made out of fake plastic whalebone, and when you sit down it just collapses around you so you don\u2019t even notice it (Wilcox, C, \u2018Vivienne Westwood\u2019, V & A Publications, 2004, p. 20).",
