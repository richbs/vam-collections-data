It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre of Varieties, Hanley. He compiled them in a series of albums.\n\nAlthough not dressed for the act in this image, Norman French was described by the artist George Cooke as a \u2018sand dancer\u2019. When he appeared at the Grand Theatre at Hanley in February 1903, the reviewer noted, \u2018Mr Norman French, the comedian and eccentric dancer, is about the most gifted of this class of entertainer who has yet put in an appearance at this hall\u2019.\n\nThe sand dance was a popular music hall number in which the performer did an \u2018eccentric dance\u2019 with exaggerated oriental movements, dressed in an approximate Egyptian style. Wilson, Keppel and Betty were exponents of the act in the 1930s. Their fame was more enduring than that of Norman French.",

The sand dance was a popular music hall number where the performer did an 'eccentric dance' with exaggerated oriental movements, dressed in an approximate Egyptian style.  Wilson, Keppel and Betty' were more famous exponents of the act in the 1930s.  This comes from the second album of caricatures in a collection of albums owned by the Theatre Museum compiled by the graphic artist George Cooke.  It is labelled by the artist 'Geo Cooke HYS BOOKE' and features music hall performers working in the early 20th century.",
