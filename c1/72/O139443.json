He started making screenprints with the master printer Chris Prater in the early 1960s and continued to do so into the 1980s (Prater retired in 1992).  Kitaj was associated with the Pop Art movement because in both his prints and paintings he made collages from mass-produced imagery but his work contains many erudite and esoteric references to 'high' culture and literature, which distinguish him from his contemporaries such as Eduardo Paolozzi, Allen Jones or Peter Phillips who rather relied on popular and commercial imagery. In this print images of the 19th century French sculptor, Dalou,  an etching of a peasant by the 19th century French painter Legros, a plate from a book of recipes and other images are  brought together in a somewhat enigmatic manner.",
