Its arms show the lion of England and the eagle of Austria acting as supporters for a shield on which St George drives his lance through the royal arms of France.  The motto was 'For Our Country'.  From 1751-3 the Society offered a number of premiums to promote British skills, including, for example, ten guineas for the best piece of English lace for men's ruffles.  Its final premium in 1753 was awarded to Captain John Mead 'for having caught the greatest number of whales last season'.\n\nOwnership & Use\nA number of Antigallican badges survive in painted enamel and in silver, and they were presumably worn at meetings by members.  An elaborate example mounted with rock crystals is in the British Museum.  The V&A's badge was made for a MacKay, but no further identification has been firmly established.",
