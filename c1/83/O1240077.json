She studied fine art at St Martin's School of Art, and jewellery and enamels at the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London. On leaving in 1956, she took the then highly unusual decision to work as an independent designer and maker. In 1962 she established the pioneering course in experimental jewellery at Hornsey School of Art where many of the next generation of British artist-jewellers were taught.\n\nThis necklace from 1988 is a superb example of the fused gold surfaces, their sumptuous texture overlaid with a delicate tracery of swirling craters and bubbles, that typify her work. The influence of nature, and of Gustav Klimt and the Viennese Secession are all apparent in her work, which delights and surprises with its spontenaiety of form and exquisite sense of colour.",
