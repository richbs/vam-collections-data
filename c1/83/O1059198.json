I, p. 72, pl. XLIII, fig. 4; <i>Catalogue of Miniatures</i>, 1908, p. 8, fig. 12; Holmes 1906, p. 374, fig. 2; Goulding 1914-15, pp. 9, 23; Foster 1914-16, vol. n, p. 65, no. 41 0; Long 1929, p. 88; Long 1930, p. 12; Piper 1963, p. 308; Foskett 1974, p. 118; <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 10 (as formerly believed to be by Cooper) . \n\nThe miniature was generally accepted as a portrait of Sandwich until recently when it and other more or less plausible candidates admitted by Piper 1963 were left out. (1) This is undoubtedly correct, for in 1669 Sandwich had been KG for some nine years, and would certainly have been shown wearing his ribbon. \n\nLong's acceptance had been based on comparison of this miniature with the portrait by Lely of c.1660, represented in the NPG2 by a copy. However, the latter image is not close, even allowing for the difference of date: the sitter for this one if anything looks younger. Nor is the likeness compatible with the later Lely portrait for the 'Flagmen' series (National Maritime Museum), which at c.1667 is close in date to this miniature. \n\nThe miniature has also been generally accepted as a work of Cooper, even as an especially beautiful one. The difficulty with this comes from the fact that the paint surface bears very little relation to that of most Cooper works of the late 1660s, even those in which the original bright colour has survived. The handling here is unmistakably polychrome and stippled, not hatched and blended as in classic late Cooper. Furthermore, the placing of the figure in the oval, the lighting, and the awkward crowding of the signature and date into the small space on the left, do not conform to the 'relaxation' of the image that Cooper achieved through increasing the size of his ovals and pushing the sitter back from the picture plane. As far as these features go, an attribution to Peter Cross would be preferable: comparison would be with the Robert Ken, dated 1667 (Cat. No. 164), and indeed Cross at the beginning of his long career is increasingly emerging as an artist capable of this level of performance. But there is no evidence that the signature has been added, or altered, so it seems unwise to disturb the traditional classification of the miniature with the rest of the Coopers. \n\n1 Davies 1979, vol.1, p. 122. \n2 No. 609.\u201d",
