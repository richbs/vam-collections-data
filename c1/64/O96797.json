Images of it became very graphic by the end of the Middle Ages. Artists emphasized the suffering of Christ in order for the viewer to experience an emotional response.\n\nThe scene here portrays the moment when the soldiers of Pontius Pilate, the Roman official who sentenced Christ to death by Crucifixion, fix thorny branches on Christ's head in imitation of a crown. Christ's enemies charged that he had claimed to be 'King of the Jews', and this Crown of Thorns was intended both to humiliate and to injure him.\n\nThe Crown of Thorns was venerated in Mount Sion as late as 870. By about 1063 it had been transferred to Constantinople (present-day Istanbul). Bits of it had been removed and given as devotional gifts to various rulers. In 1238, Baldwin, the Latin Emperor of the Byzantine Empire, offered what remained to Louis IX of France, who built the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris to house this priceless relic. During the French Revolution, which began in 1789, it was removed for safe-keeping. In 1806 it was installed in the cathedral of Notre-Dame in Paris, where it still remains.",

And when they had plated a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!\n\nMark 15: 16-17\nAnd the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band. And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns and put it about his head.\n\nJohn 19: 2\nAnd the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe.",
