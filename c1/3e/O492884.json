            "public_access_description": "The netsuke is a toggle. Japanese men used netsuke to suspend various pouches and containers from their sashes by a silk cord. Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. Above all they had to have the means of attaching the cord. In this example, there are a pair of holes (himotoshi) on the bottom of the sandal.  Although netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated is the katabori (shape carving). This is a three-dimensional carving, such as this netsuke of a No actor as Kiyohime.\n\nFrom the 18th century onwards, many more makers signed their netsukes. This example is signed Shuzan. Shuzan considered himself the successor of Yoshimura Shuzan and was called Nagamachi after the Osaka suburb where he lived. He is renowned for painting his netsuke as recorded in the Soken Kisho, by Inaba Tsuryu. This netsuke depicts the character of Kiyohime, a young woman who is scorned by her lover and transforms into a witch and then a serpent to pursue him. Her love, a Buddhist monk, escapes by boat to a temple and hides under a bell. Kiyohime, as a snake, coils around the bell creating such an intense heat that the monk is burnt inside. In this depiction the character of Kiyohime can be deciphered due to the bell-striker in the netsuke's right hand.",
