Rather than being a requisite accessory, the hat was now free to be more of a style statement. Turbans and soft wide-brimmed hats gave a dramatic finish to the narrow-waisted styles of the period.\n\nThis yellow cotton summer hat by milliner Diane Logan  is cleverly constructed with the crown made from pieced segments, similar to a beach ball. The wide brim has a slight oval shape to it and is topped off with a sprig of yellow flowers.  \n\nMilliner Diane Logan studied at Camberwell Art College and made hats for label Mr Fish. She studied millinery techniques at the London College of Fashion before setting up her own label. Her eponymous boutique was situated at 42 Chiltern Street and her hats were stocked by numerous high fashion shops and boutiques around Britain and also in New York, in Bloomingdales and Henry Bendell. Alongside her own designs, Logan's boutique also contained her own 'Hat Museum' which showcased her collection of hats dating from 1900-1950. These could be rented out at a cost of \u00a34 per day.\n\nThis hat was donated to the museum by the owner of an Oxford fashion boutique 'Go to Jericho'. Situated at 123 Walton Street, Oxford, the boutique stocked key fashion labels of the time including Ossie Clarke, Foale and Tuffin, Mr Freedom and Jean Muir.",
