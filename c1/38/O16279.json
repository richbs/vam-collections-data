It is based on a death mask, made by laying plaster over the face of the deceased to create a mould.\n\nThe sitter wears a cappuccio, an elaborate headdress that was commonly worn by Florentines in the 15th century. The possible man represented in the bust, Niccolo di Giovanni Capponi (1416-91) was gonfaloniere di giustizia (magistrate  and captain of troops responsible for city magistrates' defence) in 1464.",

The bust is a characteristic example of a portrait cast from a death mask. The sitter wears a <font -i>cappuccio, an elaborate headdress that was commonly worn by Florentines in the 15th century. The bust may represent Niccolo di Giovanni Capponi (1416-91), who was <font -i>gonfaloniere di giustizia</font -i> (magistrate  and captain of troops responsible for city magistrates' defence) in 1464.",
