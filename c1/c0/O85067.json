In contrast to the wares produced for the many religious buildings furnished by the pious sultan, which were appropriately aniconic in their decoration as required under the tenets of Islam, Fatima\u2019s ewer includes bands of real and fantastic animals amidst luxuriant trees. Similar imagery was used in Arabic poetry and had mystical connotations (such as the verdancy of Paradise); it seems safe to assume that this was not lost on Fatima herself.",
