The group includes a priest and various children and adult attendants, some playing musical instruments or singing, others bowing down in worship and all positioned around the central small figure of a idol or 'pagod' seated on a tall pedestal.\n\nBustelli's figure illustrates the continuing fascination for the exotic in fashionable society. Oriental figures had been modelled by K\u00e4ndler at the influential Meissen porcelain factory from about 1740 onwards.  However, an interesting fresco in the Chinese pavilion (Pagodenburg) in the grounds of Nymphenburg castle, executed in by Johann Anton Gumpp in 1719, may have inspired Bustelli to use this particular format for his integrated group.  It shows an idol figure seated on a towering pedestal surrounded by a group of worshippers.",

According to Ziffer, Bustelli modelled a series of Chinese musicians designed to stand around the central figureof an idol on tall plinth.  These were offered for sale together as 'Tempel der G\u00f6tzen nebst 16 G\u00f6tzenfiguren' (temple of an idol with 16 worshippers).
