The main plants are lily-like, but smaller flowering plants are intertwined with them at the base and elsewhere. Hovering above the plant sprays are birds, small sprigs of flowers and butterflies. The head (or kepala) of the cloth has a purple ground, patterned with another large bouquet of flowers.  The field is divided from the head section on either side by a band of floral ornament echoing the flower heads elsewhere, and a frieze runs around the top and bottom of the sarong.  The flowers are coloured predominantly pink and violet with white reserved. The sarong is worked on the purple (head) section with a reserve inscription , the signature of 'E van Zuylen'.",

Born in Batavia (now Jakarta) Eliza van Zuylen and her family owned and ran the largest batik workshops in Pekalongan from 1890 to 1946. The batik industry was one of the main industries in Pekalongan at the time, with businesses  under both Javanese, Chinese, Arab, Indian and Dutch ownership and management. The batiks for which the van Zuylen name is best known are those which combined European and traditional designs, or were completely modern and drew on European sources--Dutch postcards, wallpaper designs, printed cottons and pictures from a variety of sources which featured floral and animal motifs. This pattern of a series of bouquets was extremely popular. The custom of signing a batik was introduced by European manufacturers and subsequently copied by Chinese makers. It was never practised by Javanese makers.",
