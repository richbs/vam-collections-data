            "physical_description": "Printed round shawl with hood. The ground of the shawl is in fine wool and silk gauze with half inch bands and stripes of silk forming a check at four inch intervals. This is dyed dark chocolate with white reserves (or discharge) left for printing in eight colours and black. The deep border (over 25 inches) is in three parts. At the base are small tilted pines with red and blue grounds, flower-filled, on chocolate and pale green-blue compartments formed by sprays of semi-naturalistic flowers and fern-like leaves. These protrude into an area of pale blue covered with tiny flowers-filled pines. The upper edge of this area is marked by a cresting of the same style small flowers and leaves invading the dyed area above. Side guards on a white ground have a zigzag with clusters of flowers in the interstices. A narrower black ground guard with a wave-pattern meander and single flower heads runs round near the hem, with the outer end compartments each with a swag of flowers on alternately red and green or blue.\n\nThe side guard stripes run round the neck of the shawl with an additional invading spray of flowers and leaves. Exactly the same guard as the one near the hem runs round the opening of the hood. Just inside that is a new pattern element, a white ground flower-filled guard that is graded, and wide at the top running to almost nothing down the tapering front sides which are sewn to the curve of the shawl neck. From this inner guard are more invasive flower sprays of the same type as those in the body of the shawl.\n\nThe hood, printed en suite with the shawl, may have been re-attached and lined at some later period in the 19th century, for the ruching at the back of the neck and the tucks at the front top of the hood, fastened with a white silk tassle which would normally have been found on the back point of the hood, do not sit easily with the printed pattern. Probably the shawl was meant to be a burnous with hood merely for show, which was later transformed into a hood for wearing, though the placing of the tassel would make this awkward. The hood is lined with white taffeta, ruched at the back of the neck.",
