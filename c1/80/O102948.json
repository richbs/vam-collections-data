The caption and vignette monkeys imply that what he does is an unsuitable occupation for a man - nothing more than any animal does naturally but, as the caption also says - he should care!  Although the print is intended to be satiric, it actually shows a charming, ebulliant and charismatic performer, an evocative image of one of the greatest male dancers of all time.",

Eventually numbering 145 items, some of which had belonged to the ballerina Anna Pavlova, it was one of the first and most important specialist collections in private hands.  \nRambert bought the first print as a wedding present but could not bear to give it away.  As the collection grew, it was displayed in the bar of the Mercury Theatre, the headquarters of Ballet Rambert, but in 1968, Rambert gave the collection to the Victoria and Albert Museum; seven duplicates were returned to Rambert, but these are catalogued in Ivor Guest's A Gallery of Romantic Ballet, which was published before the collection came to the V&A.  Although often referred to as a collection of Romantic Ballet prints, there are also important engravings of 17th and 18th century performers, as well as lithographs from the later 19th century, by which time the great days of the ballet in London and Paris were over.\nThe aquatint is a companion print to S.4965-1968.\nThe inscription relates to an anecdote in Plutarch\u2019s Laconic Apothegms.",
