To the back of the bodice are attached 'bat's wings', the ribs beaded, the wings decorated with a pattern of spiders' webs. She wears a headdress of similar wing shapes, bracelets and rings decorated with spiders, and black ankle boots, and in her right hand carries a mask in the shape of a bat. Black and silver patterned swatches of fabric and net attached by metal pins to the right hand edge and the upper left hand corner. The design is signed and is inscribed in pencil with the production title, the theatre, the scene, the name of the character and actor, and costume details.",
