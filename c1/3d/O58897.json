The neck has a rosewood fingerboard, but the instrument has never been played with this. A remaining ebony 'beard' shows that the orignal fingerboard was of ebony. The back of the neck has a lower section, probably original, with a kidney pattern inlaid in dark wood. The back of the long head has a crude imitation of this pattern, which also occurs on the front. This long head, which ocntains both pegboxes is not original. The pegs are moden, the main pegbox being for six double courses and the upper for six single strings. ... According to Engel, the instrument was orginally a lute, and the present fingerboard is pobably a fake. \" (Baines, Anthony. <u>Catalogue of Musical Instruments in the Victoria and Albert Museum - Part II: Non-Keyboard instruments</u>.
