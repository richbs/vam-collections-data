The Derby factory probably took manufacturing moulds from a plaster model obtained from one of the London plaster shops.The Derby factory first made this model with a plain square base. As fashions changed, the base was replaced with an elaborately scrolled Rococo one, and in the 1780s, with the octagonal fluted slab used here. Such figures would probably have been used as library or mantlepiece ornaments.",
