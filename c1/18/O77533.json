The engraver first creates a surface that will print solid black by roughening the surface of a copper plate with a serrated tool called a 'rocker'.  This process raises a fragile burr of displaced copper which will hold a lot of printing ink. The design is then created by smoothing this burr in varying degrees to print a range of velvety tones. For white highlights, the engraver polishes the burr completely away, making the plate perfectly smooth once more, so no ink will adhere after the surface has been wiped.\n\nPeople\nThomas Frye is important to both the history of printmaking and the history of porcelain manufacture. He had a promising early career as an artist, but seems to have abandoned it to become instead a partner in the Bow porcelain factory in London. Frye registered several patents in the 1740s for improvements to the manufacturing process and his epitaph in the Gentleman's Magazine described him as 'The Inventor and first Manufacturer of PORCELAIN in England'.\n\nOn retirement from the factory in 1759, after 15 years during which he painted very little, Frye resumed work as an artist. His most famous works are a series of striking, lifesize mezzotint portraits. This self-portrait is from that series and Frye has shown himself in his capacity as an artist. He holds a drawing implement known as a 'porte-crayon' (literally, a crayon-holder).",
