Matthew Hilton designed the Orwell Chair for SCP in 1996.  He made a fibreglass mould for a 1:5 scale model of the chair, to show its shape and proportions.  This is a cast taken from that mould.  It is not painted to look realistic, but Hilton has indicated in pen the dimensions of the finished chair, and minute variations he would like to make to the profile. The cast is inscribed 'Hilton Orwell SCP 02.96', indicating the date of February 1996 when he made it, and he has signed it too, suggesting he was satisfied with it.",
