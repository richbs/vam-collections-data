The outside of this compass is engraved with a dial, with a circular brass pointer and a mariner's compass. The inside is engraved with a table of latitutes, various dials, and the signs of the Zodiac. \nSimilar pieces were produced at that date in Dieppe by the Bloud family and others, but it is even more similar to sundials produced in Nuremberg, and especially the work of the Miller workshop, which was active in Nuremberg from 1613 to the 1670s. Leonhart Miller was one of a family of compass makers in Nuremberg during the seventeenth century; more that one maker of this name may have been active there at that time. His mark, a fleur-de-lys, is known in various forms.",
