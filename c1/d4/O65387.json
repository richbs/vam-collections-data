Many of the mounts are in styles that date from the late 18th century, or (as in this case) the beginning of the 19th century. It is often impossible to date individual examples precisely, as distinct designs remained in use for many years. In addition, manufacturers kept the patterns, so when older styles of mounts came back into fashion in the 19th century, they were readily available. This mount takes the form of an ancient Egyptian bust, and would typically have been placed at the top of the upright elements of a cabinet or bookcase.\n\nCope & Timmins were established soon after 1900 from two much older firms, Cope & Collinson (based in London since at least the 1840s) and Clarke & Timmins (who had premises in both London and Birmingham in the 19th century). In the second half of the 18th century Birmingham and London became the two principal centres of the ornamental metalworking industries, making locks, hinges, handles and decorative mounts for furniture, as well as many other products, all of which were widely exported.",
