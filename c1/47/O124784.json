The designs were drawn by an anonymous designer in about 1800 and are from an album of designs which date from about 1735-1820 and include those for snuffboxes, scent holders, watches and watch cases, spoons, fans and fan mounts, small swords, and chatelaines (ornamental chains, pins, or clasps usually worn at a woman's waist, to which trinkets, keys, purses, or other articles are attached).   by the first page. Most of the material dates from the period 1755-90.\n\nThis design which was drawn ten years later than the latest of the majority of the designs shows that the goldsmiths' workshop that had supplied the Courts of Louis XV and  Louis XVI managed to survive the French Revolution which lasted from1789 to 1799.\n\nThere is a close relationship between the contents of the album and known work by three Parisian goldsmiths, Jean Ducrollay (1710-1787), Pierre- Fran\u00e7ois Drais (active 1761-1788), and Charles Ouizille (1744-1830) whose names appear on the first page of the album. This suggests that all the designs emanate from their workshops.  Drais worked for the Court at Versailles as jeweller to both King Louis XV and Louis XVI. Ouizille worked in this capacity for Louis XVI. Most of the material dates from the period 1755-90.",
