The flat base is TIG welded to the side walls.  The handle is a circular section of aluminium tube, brush finished and anodized a deep, rich blue and the spout, a short section of tube of identical diameter passes through the handle and is parallel to the base.  The spout was also given a brushed finished before being anodized a gold colour.  The handle and spout are bolted on from the inside and are insulated with heat resistant washers to seal and prevent the transfer of heat to these components.",

He made the body of the teapot by pressing rectangular aluminium tubing into a tapered form and then coloured it by anodisation, using electricity.",
