            "public_access_description": "The Pocklington Press is a new venture, established by Tom Pocklington in 2011. The first publication, Twenty Five of One, takes a witty and original approach to the traditional ideas of the portfolio and the archive. Whilst functioning on some levels as a conventional portfolio containing the work of four artists, it also questions the concept and conventional methods of presentation. The box is an integral part of the project, and is printed with text which can in fact be scratched away - questioning the conventional notions of preservation, and longevity inherent in the idea of museums acquiring prints and portfolios. The whole is carefully designed throughout with letterpress designed by IYA Studio, and the box itself contained in an outsize paper carrier bag lettered with title etc. Technically the bag is disposable but would be considered an integral part of the piece. Barton Hargreaves' print of climbing figures is in fact 4 separate prints which fit together to create the work; George Charman produced five prints (\"Floating Pavilions\") on translucent Japanese paper which are designed to be layered to construct an image which references architectural drawings and plans, but only 2 of the sheets are included in each portfolio and the combination varies;  Cadence Kinsey's contribution is a text piece which explores the etymology and meanings of 'archive'; Freya Pocklington's somewhat whimsical images create a self-contained world in which dogs and people interact like characters in myth or fairytale.\n\nAlso included in the portfolio (although not formally part of the publication) are 6 photographs by Dylan Collard of the artists and others involved in the design and production of the portfolio. Collard was commissioned by Tom Pocklington to produce these photographs and they were exhibited alongside the prints when the edition was launched.",
