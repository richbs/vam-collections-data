Parsvanatha, the 23rd Tirthankara of the Jain religion, is depicted naked beneath a Dhataki tree, seated in a meditative posture on a simhasana (lion-supported throne). Meghakumara (Samvara) has sent a great storm (symbolised by the hands and drums in stylized clouds in the upper corners) to disturb his meditations, but the serpent-king Dharanendra raises up his seven hoods to provide shelter to the Jina. Dharanendera's consort Padmavati, seen to the Jina's left, holds an umbrella to further protect Parsvanatha from the forces of the storm. The wheel of law (dharmachakra), symbolizing the Jina's teachings, is beneath the throne, supported by a squatting gana (dwarf-like attendant). Flywhisk bearers stand in attendance, and celestial figures with garlands hover beneath the rain clouds.",

Here he is depicted naked beneath a Dhataki tree, practising the \u2018exposure to all weather\u2019 austerity. \nSamvara has sent a great storm (symbolised by the hands and drums in stylised clouds in the upper corners) to disturb Parsvanatha\u2019s meditations. However, the serpent-king Dharanendra raises up his seven hoods to provide shelter for the Jina. Dharanendra's consort Padmavati, seen to the Jina's left, holds an umbrella to further protect Parsvanatha from the forces of the storm.  The \u2018wheel of law\u2019 (\u2018dharmachakra\u2019), which symbolises the Jina's teachings, is beneath the throne.\n\nThis image of the 23rd of the Jain saints originally adorned a temple at Gyaraspur, near Bhilsa, central India. A number of Hindu shrines were found to contain the remains of Jain images. This suggests that these temples were appropriated by the Jains, probably in the medieval period.

A number of Brahmanical shrines were found to contain the remains of Jain images, suggesting that these temples were appropriated by the Jains, probably in the medieval period. Parsvanatha is represented naked, practising the \"exposure to all weather \" austerity, being attacked by the cloud Prince with a great storm, symbolised by the hands and drums in the upper corners of the relief.  The serpent naga king Dharanendra provides shelter with his seven hoods and his consort holds an umbrella over the saint.\nAt least two major temples survive at Gyaraspur; they appear to have been originally appropriated by the Jains in the early medieval period.",
