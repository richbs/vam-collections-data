At her back are double yellow-edged wings.  Her ringletted hair is dressed with flowers and round her neck is a pearl necklace.  The blue short-sleeved, scoop-necked bodice is pointed at the lower edge.  Around the lower bodice is a bunched 'frill' from which hangs the calf-length diaphanous skirt.",

Among many ballerinas who later danced the ballet, the vivacious and voluptuous Fanny Cerrito was among the most popular. \nLithography was developed in Germany by Aloys Senefelder in 1798 and became the first mass printing medium. The image was drawn on stone using a special ink or pencil; when the whole stone was inked, the drawn image held the printing ink and multiple prints could be made.  Originally the black and white prints were hand coloured, but colour printing, using a different stone for each colour, developed in the 19th century.  Lithography was not as labour-intensive as engraving or etching and produced a much softer image.  This made it perfect for illustrating the ethereal and essentially feminine ballet of the 1840s - an example of medium and subject in complete harmony.",
