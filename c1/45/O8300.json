The lower frame is carved with background elements of bullrushes and much of the floral ornament. On top of this is a second layer with further detailed ornament. On top of this are the separately carved three dimensional elements which are glued or screwed into the frame. These include the two 'ho-ho' birds and the carved floral swags disguising the joints in the glass. The back of the birds have holes where the carver fixed the wood to the bench to hold the block in place. Many elements of the carved detail are thought to be replacements; the head of the PL bird  and a section of the applied scroll on the lower section of the main oval mirror. The carving in both these areas is very flat and lifeless compared to the rest. \n\nGilding:\nExamination of the gilded finish showed that the original scheme is a combination of both burnished watergilding and oil gilding. The burnished water gilding is over a grey pink bole and is still present on many of the areas of high relief carved detail. Close examination shows that the rest of the frame was originally oil gilded. Most of the original oil gilding and some areas of the original burnished gilding has been overgilded with unburnished water gilding over a bright red bole.\n\n",

            "public_access_description": "Although here labelled as a mirror, this type of object in the 18th century was described as a girandole or sconce. It is fitted with three arms to support candles. The mirror glass reflects the candlelight to increase the volume of light. Earlier sconces had metal backplates which also reflected candle light. Here, the girandole frame has become a vehicle for elaborate Rococo carving, with flowers, leaves, bullrushes and birds (cranes often called ho-ho birds). The gilded carved surfaces also reflect candlelight.\n\nThis frame is very close to some of Chippendale's published designs. It may have been made in his workshop, or by another highly-skilled carver taking ideas from his designs. Carvers routinely varied details of a design as they worked. In his notes to another design, Chippendale advised that 'A skilful Carver may, in the Execution of this and the following Designs, give full Scope to his Capacity'.\n\nLarge sheets of plate glass were imported from France at this date. The complex design of this mirror incorporates both smaller and larger sections of glass. For the smaller sections, offcuts from larger pieces could be used, thus making the most of this expensive material.",
