Lived with his father until the latter's death 1863; died 1889. \n\nStudy of a Hand Against a Wall \n9112-1863 Neg 64504 \nCanvas, 35.6 \u00d7 33.1 cm (14 \u00d7 13 ins) Signed and dated 'Michael Mulready/1852' br \nPurchased 1863 \n\nThe hand touches moss growing on a stone wall. Like 'Study of a Hand Holding a Cup', (9111-1863, above), presumably purchased for the benefit of South Kensington students. The work shows similar anatomical detail to that in similar studies by the artist's father. \nEXH: English Romantic Art Arts Council 1947 (72) \n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
