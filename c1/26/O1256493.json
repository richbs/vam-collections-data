In 1823 he married Susanna Wilson, and they had five children. All their names, apart from the youngest, Susanna, appear on the exercise and copy books. Francis was a successful tailor, and the enterprise grew to be a flourishing family business. \n\nGeorge (born 1827) was a tailor with his father by the age of 14. He died aged only 24. \n\nElizabeth (born 1830) became a milliner and dressmaker. She married Scottish draper John Train, but was soon widowed, and thereafter is listed is woollen goods trader as well as dressmaker.\n\nFrancis (born 1832) moved to Australia, possibly before his twentieth birthday, where he stayed the rest of his life.\n\nHenry (born 1836) was an apprentice in 1851. Ten years later, at the age of 25, he inherited the family business, and by 1881 was employing 6 men and 2 boys. He was married to Elizabeth from Somerset, and they had six children.
