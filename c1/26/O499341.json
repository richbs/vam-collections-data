One year later, at the New York Institute of Technology, Riss was introduced to computer-generated art and graphics and has been using the computer as her primary artistic tool since this point.  She states \"the experience of using computers allowed me the freedom to experiment with color [sic], texture, transparency, layering and animation.\"  The figurative subject matter in these slides is typical of Riss's work.  She has written that her interest lies in \"observ[ing] the constraints of technology and society on human life\". (Patric Prince Archive, V&A, AAD/2009/19)",
