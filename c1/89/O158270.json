Reflecting its hippie origins, the poster's bright colours and image of a face with an afro hairstyle were an indication of what could be expected onstage. It was the first Broadway show with a racially-integrated cast, and caused controversy through its explicit portrayal and advocation of hallucinogenic drug-taking, sexual freedom and criticism of American foreign policy and irreverence for the American flag. It was also, however, groundbreaking in forming a new kind of musical theatre experience; designed by two actors who were from experimental theatre backgrounds, Hair's loose narrative and strong ideology linked by songs created the concept musical, where a show's metaphor or statement is more important than the actual narrative.",
