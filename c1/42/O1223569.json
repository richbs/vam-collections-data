They are similar to Lego bricks in that the studs are laid out in a 4 x 2 pattern on a standard brick. As with this example, they were originally produced in wood, but later made in plastic. They came with angled bricks which would allow for gables, and sets would come with green paper roofs and windows which would fit snuggly into the slots in the bricks. \nHalsam, the company named after its founders Hal Elliot and Sam Goss, was taken over by Playskool in 1962, and the brick sets moved away from the realistic houses they were originally designed for. Playskool began to aim the sets at smaller children, with more of a creative element to them. The last set of American Plastic Bricks was made in 1977.",
