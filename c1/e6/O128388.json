His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean. \n\nRossini\u2019s comic opera La Cenerentola (1817), is based on Charles Perrault\u2019s fairy tale Cinderella (1697).  Prince Ramiro holds a ball and will choose the most beautiful woman in attendance to be his wife.  Cinderella overcomes the malevolence of her step-sisters and step-father to captivate the Prince. Messel designed fun and light-hearted costumes and sets for the 1952 Glyndebourne production.  The production proved popular, and was revived five times.\n\nMessel made numerous studies of the wreathed columns and ribbed vaults of Prince Ramiro\u2019s luxurious palace, the setting for his romance with Cinderella.",

Oliver Messel\u2019s production was first performed by the Glyndebourne Festival Society at Glyndebourne on 18 June 1952; directed by Carl Ebert and featuring  Juan Oncina as Don Ramiro and Sesto Bruscantini as Dandini.   It was revived in 1953 (Edinburgh Festival), 1954 (Berlin), 1956 (Liverpool), 1959 and 1960 (Glyndebourne).\nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's theatre designs and other designs and artefacts.  The designs were briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being housed at the V&A from 1981 on indefinite loan.  The V&A Theatre Museum purchased the Oliver Messel collection from Lord Snowdon in 2005.\n\nHistorical significance: Messel worked for Glyndebourne from 1951 to 1959, when he was at the height of his popularity as a designer for the stage.  His work for Glyndebourne in this period is regarded as some of his best designs.",
