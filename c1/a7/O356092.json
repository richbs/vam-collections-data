A similar phenomenon occurred in France, where theatrical and historical scenes appeared about a decade after they did in England. Comparable French toiles, which begin with naval victories, become more frequent after 1789, when they are concerned with episodes of the Revolution. Certainly here one senses a growing involvement of the people as a whole with the political scene, though manufacturers must have lost heavily when they immortalized occasions of the most transitory validity; the toile showing Louis XVI in his brief role as a constitutional monarch, \"restorateur de la Liberte,\" would have been hastily ripped from many a bed after the flight to Varennes. <b>An English manufacturer of left-wing sympathies produced a similar subject showing the French king as well as the fall of the Bastille, with a misspelled inscription about \"Louis XVI regeneratel [sic] de la liberte frangois,\" and must have also regretted it.</b> ' This article is illustrated with scenes from the piece of the textile in the MMA, which has a third scene showing the King under a canopy, apparently receiving Liberty (?).",
