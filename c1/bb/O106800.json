Both are crowned with high ivory crowns. The statuette rests on a base of ivory and wood veneered with alabaster, supported on clouds of mother of pearl; below is a large pedestal of similar materials.\n\nThis statuette is copied from a well-known fourteenth century statue of the Virgin and Child in the Church of the Madonna at Trapani in Sicily, a statue attributed to Nino Pisano, made for the Carmelite Order. Devotion of the Trapani Madonna, led to numerous later copies and reduced replicas, of which this is one.",
