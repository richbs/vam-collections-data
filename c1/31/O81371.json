He joined the Haarlem Guild of St Luke in 1635 and soon went travelling in Europe until the early 1640s. He then moved to Deventer where he settled definitively at the end of the 1640s. He made few historical subjects and produced chiefly scenes of everyday life including scenes of skaters, soldiers and markets, high-life interior subjects and portraits. His genre paintings had a considerable influence on such contemporaries as Gabriel Metsu, Pieter de Hooch, Frans van Mieris and Johannes Vermeer. He had many pupils among which the most eminent was Caspar Netscher and his oeuvre was extensively copied. \n\nThis painting shows a guardroom scene with cavaliers and peasants resting in a domestic interior or a tavern. Unlike many Dutch painters who depicted soldiers, Ter Borch was familiar with them from personal experience. His native city, Zwolle and Deventer where he permanently settled in 1654 both housed garrisons because they were situated along the strategic defence lines established during the war with the Spanish. The date inscribed on the painting by a probable later hand, 1638, is consistent with the style of the painting but at that time, Ter Borch was still travelling in Europe. He most likely executed this painting during the early 1640s, once he was back in the Netherlands and witnessed the end of the Thirty Years War (1618-1648).",

London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, pp. 35-36, cat. no. 34.\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"Gerard Ter BORCH (1617-81) \n<i>Dutch School</i> \nBorn at Zwolle, Ter Borch was a pupil of Peter de Molijn in Haarlem in 1634 and entered the Haarlem guild in the following year. He travelled in England (1635), the Netherlands, Germany, France, Italy and perhaps also Spain. In 1654 he settled at Deventer, where he seems to have lived for the rest of his life. \n     He painted portraits, both of individuals and of groups, and also portrait miniatures, as well as genre scenes which were, from the 1650s, akin to those of Metsu in portraying the wealthier sections of the Dutch bourgeoisie. \n\n<i>Lit.</i> S. J. Gudlaugsson, <i>Gerard Ter Borch</i>, The Hague, 1959-60. \n\n\n34 CAVALIERS \nInscribed with a signature and date of doubtful authenticity <i>GT</i> (monogram) <i>Borch, 1638</i> \n<i>Oak panel</i> \n13 1/8 x 17 1/8 (33.4 x 42.5) \nIonides Bequest \nCAI.84 \n\nThis painting came to the Museum as an original work by Ter Borch and it was subsequently accepted by Bode in 1906 and Hofstede de Groot in 1912. Meanwhile, however, a restorer had convinced B. S. Long that the peculiar nature of the crackles indicated a 19th century copy and the picture was so catalogued in 1925. Nevertheless, it continued to be accepted as a genuine early work in the Ter Borch literature (Plietzsch, 1944; Gudlaugsson, 1959-60). Gudlaugsson suggested that the picture's strange appearance was due to the crackling of the 19th century varnish and his view was fully vindicated during its recent cleaning. The present signature does not appear to be genuine: Gudlaugsson suggests that it may be a 19th century version of a previous inscription, for the date 1638 fits well with the style and costumes of the painting. Another guardroom scene of about the same date was, until 1945, in the Kunsthalle at Bremen. \n\n<i>Condition.</i> Cleaned 1961. \n<i>Prov.</i> 1875 Hon. Colonel William(?)

From the 1640s he contributed to the development of a new genre type, showing simplified interiors with a few figures in an upright format. This composition became an important format for the second half of the 1600s. Early exponents of this new style are the so-called guardroom scenes such as the present one which are set in simple interior with full-length figures and are characterized by great refinement in the handling of colour, light, and texture and also by a subtle psychological interplay. This trend followed the manner of Amsterdam painters such as Pieter Codde (1599-1678) and Willem Duyster (ca.1598-1635) but Ter Borch introduced a new subtlety of light and naturalism.",

            "historical_context_note": "Genre painting involving low class society, especially peasants but also as the decades progressed and the demand for such pictures evolved more elevated class exponents, became more and more popular throughout the 17th century in the Netherlands. These pictures usually depict scenes of everyday life set in domestic interiors or in the countryside. Scholars are still debating whether they bear a metaphorical meaning and hidden messages, or just feature a close depiction of contemporary events. In both case they are associated with health, pleasure and liberty. Dutch genre painting is also closely related to popular literature and culture, of which proverbs form a very important element. Amsterdam occupies a central place in the history of Dutch genre painting as the city attracted provincial painters from all over the country. However the demand for these pictures was intense and the category developed in almost every well known town (Leiden, Delft, Haarlem, Utrecht and The Hague). The chief leading figures of genre painting in Holland were Jan Steen (1626-1679), Frans van Mieris (1635-1681) and Gerard Ter Borch (1617-1681). Derivative artists like Richard Brakenburgh (1650-1702), Willem van Mieris (1662-1747) and Matthys Naiveu (1647-1726) survived to continue the tradition of genre painting into the eighteenth century.",
