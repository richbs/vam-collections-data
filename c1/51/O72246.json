This bracelet demonstrates her professed liking for 'structure and abstraction' and also shows the alternative design potential of sequins, which would conventionally be applied as thin discs of colour to a fabric backing. Here they are densely-packed, displaying their edges rather than their faces, to form rigid, cylindrical rods of colour. The international fascination with non-precious and unconventional materials within jewellery in the 1970s lead to much experimental and innovatory work, and this bracelet, with its geometric form and alternating blocks of colour, is very much of its time.",
