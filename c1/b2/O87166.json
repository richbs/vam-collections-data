It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the New Theatre Oxford from 1936 for over forty years. Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nAlbert Whelan was a versatile music hall performer, born in Melbourne. He made his name in London after appearing in variety at the Empire, Leicester Square; in pantomime at Liverpool, and in 1908 at London's Pavilion Theatre where he was 'spotted' by an agent and offered a six week tour of America. Whelan always dressed immaculately and specialised in singing comic songs, but was also a great raconteur and dancer who played the violin and piano. He invented the 'signature tune' for a performer with his special way of starting a performance. He would walk slowly on stage removing his gloves, scarf, overcoat and hat whilst whistling the tune 'The Jolly Brothers'.",
