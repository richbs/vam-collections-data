In this technique an image is created from cut-out paper and often, as here, set against a contrasting background. \n\nMakers & Making\nAnna Maria Garthwaite made this example by first covering one side of a sheet of brown paper with black pigment. She then cut out the picture using either a scalpel-like knife or very fine scissors and pierced the surface of the paper in places with a needle or a pin. To add interest to the surface, she cut off some slivers of paper and stuck them down elsewhere in the picture, brown side up, as for example the branches of one of the trees. The cut-out paper picture was then laid onto a sheet of very white vellum (high quality parchment, made from animal skin) to make all the details as visible as possible.\n\nPeople\nAs an adult Anna Maria Garthwaite was one of the most talented silk designers of her generation working in London. This work, made when she was 17 years old, gives some indication of  her youthful artistic ability, which laid the foundations for her future success. Some of the trees in this cut-paper work resemble her watercolour textile designs of the 1720s.\n\nSubject Depicted\nThis cut-paper work picture shows a country house of around 1700 surrounded by gardens, with gardeners clipping trees. Huntsmen are shown chasing deer in a wooded park and in the upper right corner is a village with houses clustered around a parish church.",
