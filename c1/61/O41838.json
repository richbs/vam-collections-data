On the back, Sanskrit verses from the Rasamanjari describe her motionless state and continue, 'there is no difference between her and a painting on canvas, unless the ripple of a thrill is awakened in her on hearing your name'. Here, the lovers are depicted as Radha and Krishna.\n \nThis series of paintings is one of the earliest painted in a distinctly Pahari ('Hill') manner.
