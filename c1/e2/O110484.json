Crosses were also carried in procession before a service, and on ceremonial occasions such as funerals. \n\nBoth altar and processional crosses were generally made of precious or gilded metal, or ivory, and decorated with gems. The coral in this unusual altar cross may symbolise the blood of Christ. Coral is uncommon on crosses but it was a popular material for jewellery, especially rosaries, and was believed to have protective powers.

Until about 1000 the custom was to suspend a cross above the altar, or to place it alongside, but later the cross was generally put directly on the altar. Crosses were also carried in procession before a service, and on ceremonial occasions such as funerals. \n\nBoth altar and processional crosses were generally made of precious or gilded metal, or ivory, and decorated with gems. The coral in this unusual altar cross may symbolise the blood of Christ. Coral is uncommon on crosses but it was a popular material for jewellery, especially rosaries, and was believed to have protective powers. Originally the cross may have relics (body parts or fragments associated with saints) set beneath the crystals.\n\nFrom about 800 they bore the image of the crucified Christ and became known as crucifixes. By about 1100 the imagery of European crosses had become established. It usually included the symbols of the four Evangelists (Matthew, Mark, Luke and John), often with the Virgin Mary and St John flanking the cross.",
