Directed by John Burrell with costumes designed by Doris Zinkeisen, this wartime production has a legendary ring to it today, starring great British actors - Laurence Olivier as Richard, Ralph Richardson as Richmond and Sybil Thorndike as Margaret. Critics of the day praised the production, and one described the 'sombre pictures' created by the settings as 'grimly effective'. \n\nThis design was recreated as one of three mediaeval wall hanging for the set.  It was inspired by one of the famous 15th century French tapestries known as La Dame \u00e0 la Licorne. The flat, decoratively patterned background known as 'mille fleurs' is typical of  the style of the tapestries, as is the elongated style of the couple walking in the fields.  The artist Morris Kestelman became better known as a painter than a set designer but he worked on several productions in London during the war including the operas Carmen and Gianni Schicchi for Sadler's Wells.",
