The sleeves from the arm length to the 'horse hoof' cuffs may have been a later addition to the dress lengths. \n\nThe symbols adopted in this robe (such as striped hem representing water, a mountain divided into three parts that represents the earth, and dragons flying amid clouds) suggest an association with the Imperial Court of the Qing Dynasty. The dragons bear five-claws, a symbol of royalty; suggesting that the intended wearer may have been an imperial consort. \n\nIn general, a more limited dress-code appeared to have been available for women ranking down from the Empress and Imperial Consorts to wives of officers of the Seventh rank. (Men had a range of court dress for specific occasions). Even the Emperor's wives and concubines did not necessarily always wear robes decorated with dragons.  Women also had sets of clothes made for auspicious celebrations such as weddings or the birthdays of older wearers, and the clothes made for these occasions were worn for future events of importance.",
