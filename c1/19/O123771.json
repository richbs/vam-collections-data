Heavier coats made of woollen cloth tended to be worn in cooler weather or for more formal dress. It is, however, cut in the latest fashionable style with its crescent-shaped breast pocket and nipped-in waist.\n\nThe coat was worn by James Hope Stewart (1816-1881), a Scottish artist well-known for his portraits and history paintings. In 1862 he married Jessie Fleming Lothian in Edinburgh. Jessie bequeathed the coat to the donor's aunt, Minnie McLeish (a textile designer), whom she first met at the seaside in about 1882. Minnie was nine years old. Mrs Hope Stewart saw her looking after younger children and struck up a long-lasting friendship. Minnie McLeish gave the coat to the donor about 50 years ago.",
