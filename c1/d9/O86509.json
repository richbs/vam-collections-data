The pattern of the embroidery comprises a lattice of geometric strapwork in plaited braid stitch with silver and silver-gilt threads. Worked inside the strapwork compartments are flowers, fruits and leaves in coloured silks in detached buttonhole stitch. The grapes are similarly worked, but raised for a three-dimensional effect. The whole linen ground was once filled with spangles, each topped with a white glass bead. \n\nThe jacket may have been altered within a decade or two of its original making.  It has been shortened and gores of similarly embroidered fabric added.  The mass of spangles and beads where remaining, obscure the pattern of the embroidery.  In its initial form, there were probably fewer spangles, randomly applied.\n[Jacket part] This is the right sleeve, lined with coral silk taffeta.\n[Jacket part] This is the left sleeve, lined with coral silk\n[Jacket part] This is the right front and back of the jacket, with a coral silk taffeta back.

The front edge has 20 metal eyelets and the back edge 17 embroidered eyelets.",

            "public_access_description": "These pieces once formed part of a woman\u2019s jacket and are beautiful examples of the splendour of British embroidery between 1600 and 1620. The foundation pattern in plaited braid stitch with silver-gilt thread is strapwork, a design also used in other decorative arts of this period. The leaves and flowers are filled in with a detached buttonhole stitch in a variety of coloured silks. The grapes have been worked over thick padding to give them an almost three-dimensional shape. \n\nParts of the linen ground of the jacket were once completely covered with spangles, each topped with a tiny bead. This may have been a later addition to the original embroidery. The jacket may have been used as part of a costume for a masque (masked ball), with the additional spangles and beads added to make the jacket gleam in the candlelight. The British philosopher and writer Francis Bacon (1561-1626) wrote an essay, \u2018Of Masques and Triumphs\u2019, in 1594, advising on the colours and decorations most effective for masque costume. He recommended spangles, \u2018as they are of no great cost, so they are of most glory. As for rich embroidery, it is lost, and not discerned.\u2019",

Sir Francis Bacon's essay, On Masques and Triumphs of 1594, makes a number of recommendations about costumes for the masque, including \"oes or spangs, as they are of no great cost, so they are of most glory. As for rich embroidery, it is lost and not discerned.\"\n\nHistorical significance: Lavishly embroidered jackets were fashionable during the first two decades of the 17th century and are often seen in portraiture, usually worn with a petticoat and loose gown as formal day wear.  The embroidery on this example represents a unique variation on other multi-coloured needlework designs of the period.  The foundation pattern in plaited braid stitch with silver-gilt thread is in a strapwork design, a geometrical outline rather than the curving stems usually seen.  The three-dimensional rendering of the grapes is a particularly rich treatment of the form. This particular jacket once had its linen ground completely covered with spangles, each topped with a tiny bead, an unusually luxurious handling of space.",
