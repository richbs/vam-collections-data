The ballet was premiered by the Camargo Society in 1931 and subsequently taken into the repertory of the Ballet Club (later Ballet Rambert) and the Vic-Wells (now Royal) Ballet with the same Armstrong designs.  It is possible that this is a later redrawing either for the Vic-Wells Ballet staging or as illustration to a book on ballet design.   \nThe design came to the Theatre Museum as part of the Cyril Beaumont Bequest, and the number \"1307\" indicates that it was originally part of the Ballet Guild collection that became part of the London Archives of the Dance.  The Archives never achieved an independent home and part of the collection was  stored with Cyril Beaumont, where it became inextricably mixed with his own collection and came to the Museum as part of the Cyril Beaumont Bequest.\n\nHistorical significance: A design for Ashton's first masterpiece and one of his most enduring ballets.  In using the contemporary painter John Armstrong as designer, the ballet was following in the Diaghilev tradition of commissioning easel artists as stage designers.",
