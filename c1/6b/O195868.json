            "public_access_description": "This group is of a Bacchante, a female follower of Bacchus, the god of wine (here she wears a vine wreath) and intoxication in Roman mythology. Bacchantes were the most important members of Bacchus' retinue. They were a popular subject in art dating from ancient Rome and Greece to the modern period. Here the Baccante is seated with cupid and a child.  \n\nJoseph-Charles Marin (1759-1834), the sculptor, was a pupil and friend of the better known Clodion and this work echoes Clodion's depiction of female semi-nudes. The V&A has examples of the work in terracotta of both sculptors. This particular subject was one with which Marin experimented, producing several slightly different compositions in the 1790s.\n\nAlthough terracotta is often associated with models - an intermediate stage in making finished works of sculpture - by the 1760s undecorated but finished terracotta sculptures had become fashionable, especially in France. Such terracottas were prized and collected as works of art. They included a variety of sculptural work, including decorative domestic pieces. This group, with the smooth terracotta of the skin contrasting to assured and highly textured modelling for hair and other details, is exactly the type of object that was displayed in fashionable interiors. The high degree of finish and finely rendered detail are matched by the technical expertise needed to ensure a successful firing at a high temperature.",
