The region\u2019s natural gold resources had made the Asante wealthy and court regalia, which included textiles (kente), ivory and gold, reflected high levels of skill and technology.\n\nThis cast gold pectoral disc was worn around the neck by those responsible for the ritual purification of the Asantehene\u2019s soul. The Asante call the discs akrafokonmu, usually translated as \u2018soul discs\u2019 or \u2018soul washers\u2019 badges\u2019. \n\nFollowing Asante efforts to protect a coastal trading outlet, British forces invaded the state capital Kumasi on 4 February 1874. The Asantehene, Kofi Karikari, fled leaving behind much precious regalia which was captured and later sold at auction at Garrard\u2019s, the London crown jewellers. The Museum\u2019s accession registers record the purchase of this and twelve other items of Asante gold and silverware from Garrard\u2019s on 5 June 1874.",

Following Major-General Sir Garnet Wolseley\u2019s invasion of Kumasi (capital of the then independent state of Asante, Ghana) on 4 February 1874, the palace of the Asantehene was ransacked and the Asante forced to pay a war indemnity of 50,000 ounces of gold. On return to the UK, some of this gold was auctioned by Garrard\u2019s, the London\u2019s Crown jewellers, which is almost certainly how the V&A acquired these pieces. Records of the auction were lost during the Second World War.\nDisplayed in \"V and A Africa: Exploring Hidden Histories\"\n15th November 2012- 3rd February 2013",

Cast gold disks called akrafokonmu ('soul washer's disk') were protective emblems worn by important members of the court, including royal attendants known as akrafo, or 'soul washers.' Individuals selected for this title were beautiful men and women born on the same day of the week as the king. They ritually purified and replenished the king's, and thus the nation's, vital powers. \n\nSource: Alexander Ives Bortolot, Department of Art History and Archaeology, Columbia University",
