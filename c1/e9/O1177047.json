Romaya first had the idea of methodically exposing envelopes to sunlight when she noticed the bleaching effect of light upon some envelopes that had been left upon a window ledge.  \n\nIn this series, Romaya traces the daily changes of the moon for one lunar cycle - approximately 29.5 days. Romaya creates cut card and acetate stencils from images sourced from such diverse sources as NASA, Galileo and Ansel Adams. The stencils are placed over the envelope interiors which are then either adhered to the inside of a south-facing window or on the inside of a windowsill. The time it takes for the image to reveal itself depends upon the envelope material as well as the weather.  \n\nAccording to the artist, the series title pays debt to the famous ukioyo-e wood-block print series, Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji by the Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai (1760-1849).",
