He was a prolific printmaker, and his etchings have the same quiet, meditative qualities as the paintings. Morandi endlessly explored the geometric and formal possibilities with apparently limited subject-matter, often using, as in this print, the same diagonal, straight-line hatching across the whole printing plate to create a wide range of tonal values.\n\nThis etching is one of four still lives set in tondos, which Morandi began in 1942. This composition is the reverse of that of a near-contemporary painting.",
