According to Towndrow, Stevens preferred to use friends or members of his household as models and this bust may have been based on his housekeeper when he was living at North End, Fulham Road.\n\nA sculptor, designer and painter, Alfred Stevens (1817/18-1875) rejected contemporary distinctions between fine art and design. From 1850 to 1857 he was chief designer to Hoole &amp; Co., Sheffield, where he produced award-winning designs for metalwork, majolica, terracotta ornaments and chimney-pieces. Perhaps his two greatest works were the decorations for the dining-room at Dorchester House, London (about 1856), for which he made countless drawings inspired by the Italian High Renaissance style, in particular the work of Michelangelo and the monument to the Duke of Wellington for St Paul's Cathedral, London, which was completed after his death. The two allegorical groups from this monument made a lasting impact on the New Sculpture movement. \nThe influence of the Italian Renaissance is evident in much of Steven's work, and is perhaps best reflected in the Wellington monument.\n\nAlthough Stevens came equal fifth in the competition for the Wellington monument, the winner being the Scots sculptor William Calder Marshall (1813-1894), he was eventually given the commission as his design was felt to be more in keeping with the interior of St  Paul's.",
