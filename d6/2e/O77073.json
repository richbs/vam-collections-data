The 'Crucifixion' is a screen-printed artist's proof, and embodies Aitchison's style of abbreviated forms and strong pastel colours, which he has continued throughout his career.\n\nIn 1955, Aitchison was awarded a British Council Scholarship to study in Italy; here he was deeply affected by the landscape, the quality of the light, and by his appreciation of early Italian art with its simplified depiction of events.\n\nIn this Crucifixion, the simplified figure of Christ is seen almost as forming part of the vertical upright of the cross - no horizontal is shown. His image floats in a yellow space, while to the left the stylised figure of a dog (a Bedlington terrier, a recurrent motif in Craigie Aitchison's work), also floating in that space, gazes enquiringly towards it. Characteristically, the print is not signed or inscribed on the front: Aitchison does not wish any distraction to the simple austerity of the composition.",
