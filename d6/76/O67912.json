            "public_access_description": "Deborah Bowness is a designer and maker of innovative bespoke wallpapers which use photographic imagery of domestic furnishings and other objects to create individualised decorative schemes. This particular design features life-size images of standard lamps, screen-printed and with colour added to selected details. She was one of the finalists in the Peugeot Design in Awards in 2000, with her Hooks and Frocks wallpaper which was a photographic montage of dresses, chairs and bags.  The wallpapers are printed to order, and can be customised for each client. Bowness also pioneered a method of hanging the wallpaper by simply fixing it at the top edge and allowing it to float against the wall.\n\nHer work has featured in the Guardian's Space interiors magazine, Elle Decoration and other design publications, and is part of the current designer-led renaissance in wallpaper. Though designed as wallpaper, Bowness's wallpaper prints are sold as unique individual panels and can also be seen as prints in a wallpaper format. These papers stand between traditional commercial wallpaper production and the limited edition artists' wallpapers produced exclusively for installations. Bowness's papers represent an important trend in contemporary wallpaper production, towards one-off pieces and personalised designs, with wallpaper used as a conversation piece, a prominent feature of an interior rather than a background.",
