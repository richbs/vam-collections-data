Luc in 1763, he exhibited in the Salon de S. Luc in 1774 and in the Salons of the Louvre of 1795, 1796 and 1799. He died in 1800. His recorded work largely consists of busts and portrait medallions. He is best known for his bust of the Prince of Conti, of which the terracotta (signed October 1776) is in the Museum at Dijon. Versailles possesses a plaster. Two marbles exist, both dated 1777 (one belongs to Duchesse de Rohan, Chateau de Josselin, Brittany, the whereabouts of the other is unknown - information supplied in letter to Sculpture Dept by Louis Reau). \n\nThere is a terracotta bust of an unknown man by M\u00e9rard in the Spencer Museum of Art, University of Kansas (1952.0011). A terracotta bust of Claude Fran\u00e7ois Moreau of 1769 was sold by Sotheby's (1990, 1997 and 2000).",
