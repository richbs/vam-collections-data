The garment is dirty and in need of a small amount of repair to the hooks and eyes and to the lace. \n*The arm holes are very tight on the doll and it may be that this is not original; however; the stuffing of the arms has hardened which might account for the the tightness. \n3. drawers; white cotton with broderie anglaise around cuffs and ties at waist.\n*It is probable that these are original to the doll and they look similar to the clothing seen in the photographs. \n4. pink sash; silk ribbon in very poor condition with the majority of it shattered. \n5. photograph; formal setting of a child half reclining on a chair and holding the doll. Printed on the back in a blue is a floral design with a bird and the name `S. Bettoney; Crosby Street; Maryport' The style of dress is 1870-80. 4\u00bcin x 2\u00bdin \n6. photograph; of a young child holding the doll with her left hand and a cane (possibly an umbrella) in her right. She is in a garden setting. Marked along the right edge are photographer's numbers HJ2088. The style could be any date between 1890 and 1910. \n*Maryport Cumbria was a coal port and it is probable that the photo reference is related to this town rather than an American town. There is no modern listing of a Maryport in the USA/Canada; however; this does not mean that during the 19th century such a town did not exist. The reference to Crosby Street also seems to suggest an English source as there is one Crosby (there are a number in England) located just a few miles north of Maryport. \n*B Eilbeck is likely to be a woman. There are several possibilities about why a person in England would make a type of doll known only to have been made in the USA. 1. She may have been an American; living in England when making the doll. Using a technique seen elsewhere she used the idea to create her own version. 2. She may have been English; visited or seen the American versions and used the technique to create her own doll. 3. The doll may have been brought over to England and the hand written part added as a result of dressing the doll. \n*Further investigations will be undertaken to establish whether Maryport Cumbria supports the theories as to the identity of the maker and the photographer.",
