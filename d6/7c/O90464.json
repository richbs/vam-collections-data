The back is hollowed out, showing signs that a chisel-shaped tool was employed to scoop out the wet clay. The bust was probably modelled as the basis for marble portraits of the grand duke, who played a pivotal role in Foggini's career. Foggini was the leading sculptor of later 17th-century Florence. After training with his uncle Jacopo Maria Foggini (1620s-1684) and the painter Jacopo Giorgi, Foggini was chosen by Cosimo III to study at the newly founded Florentine Academy in Rome.",
