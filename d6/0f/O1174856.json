His work regularly appears in magazines such as i-D, Arena and the American, Italian, and French editions of Vogue. Klein has become known for powerful work that confronts themes such as violence, death and masochism, breaking with the conventions of contemporary beauty and fashion photography. This elaborately staged image is from a series called 'Step Into The Future' for L'Uomo Vogue, published November 2006. It is part of a body of work by Klein produced between 2001 and 2010 through which he has painted a portrait of decadence and decay in America.",
