This rare facet-cut glass example, however, must date from  the 1760s-1780s.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThoroughly impractical as a container for boiling water, this glass pot may have been intended for serving some attractively-coloured sauce. Table glass items with overall facet-cutting were usually intended for the dessert table, where the candlelight would enhance their appearance. The designer of this 'teapot' has used as a model the Staffordshire lead-glazed red earthenware and salt-glazed stoneware teapots of the 1730s-1740s, which in turn were copied from contemporary Meissen porcelain.",
