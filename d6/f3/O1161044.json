These include another train set made by Palitoy, as well as other mechanical toys such as a tractor modelled on the life size Massey Ferguson and a Lotus racing car. All of the toys in the collection date from around the 1960s and belonged to the donors children. They are made by a variety of manufacturers from around the world and so this collection is a good indicator sample of toys from this period.",
