Given his strong attraction to the narrative of the Fall of Man, the publisher Septimus Prowett must have considered him a natural choice for the project.  Martin had never produced mezzotints before (although he would become reknowned for his work in this medium), and his roots as a painter are apparent in his decision to make a preparatory oil sketch for each print, of which this painting is one.  The set of oil sketches was rediscovered by the collector and dealer Robert Frank in 1951.",

Apprenticed to Leonard Wilson, a coach painter in Newcastle; left after a year and took painting lessons from the Italian immigrant Boniface Musso (father of the miniature painter Charles Muss). Moved to London 1806. Exhibited 84 works at the RA between 1811 and 1852, 37 at the BI 1813-51, and 62 (including watercolours and prints) at the SBA 1824-48. Subjects mainly literary and biblical, but also landscapes. Won prizes at the BI 1817 and 1821. An opponent of the art establishment, especially the RA, he nevertheless became Historical Painter to Princess Charlotte and Prince Leopold (receiving the Knighthood of the Order of Leopold) , and Member of the Academies of Brussels, Antwerp, and Rome. Among his other activities, his elaborate plans for London's sewage disposal were diverting in both senses of the word. Most famous for his vast scenes of (usually) biblical destruction, such as 'Belshazzar's Feast', culminating in the 'Last Judgment' triptych (now Tate Gallery), and for his mezzotint illustrations to Paradise Lost (1827) and the Bible (1833). Many of his works were engraved, often by himself. Both famous and notorious in his own day, he was and remains the epitome of the powerfully Sublime type of Romantic artist and personality, dealing with dramas of Nature in conflict with Man. Died Douglas, Isle of Man, 17 February 1854; his studio was sold by Christie's in May and 4-5 July 1854 (see Athenaeum report 27 May 1854, p657). His brothers Jonathan and William were equally if not more notorious, as pyromaniac and inventor respectively. Watercolours and many prints by Martin are also in the V&A collections. \n\nLIT: 'Autobiographical Notes' Athenaeum 14 June 1834, p459; Gentleman's Magazine 1854, vol i, pp433-6 (obit); Athenaeum 25 February 1854, pp246-7 (obit); Art Journal 1854, p118 (obit), 1855, p195; L Martin 'Reminiscences of John Martin KL' Newcastle Weekly Chronicle January-April 1889;; M Pendered John Martin, Painter: His Life and Times 1923; R Todd 'The Imagination of John Martin' Tracks in the Snow: Studies in English Science and Art 1946; T Balston John Martin 1789-1854: His Life and Works 1947 (copy annotated by the author in the National Art Library, V&A); John Martin Whitechapel Art Gallery exhibition catalogue 1953; T Balston 'John Martin: New Discoveries' Burlington Magazine November XCVI, 1954, p350; J Seznec John Martin en France 1968; John Martin, Artist-Reformer-Engineer exhibition catalogue Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, 1970; John Martin Hazlitt, Gooden & Fox exhibition catalogue 1975; W Feaver The Art of John Martin 1975 \n\nAdam Listening to the Voice of the Almighty\nP3-1969 Neg GD2436 \nCanvas, 47.5 X 68.5 cm (l8 \u00be X 27 ins) Purchased 1969 \nAn oil sketch preparatory to one of the mezzotint illustrations to Milton's Paradise Lost executed and published by Martin in 1827. The commission, probably dating from early in 1823, was from the publisher Septimus Prowett to produce 24 mezzotints for \u00a32000, and an extra \u00a31500 for a second set of smaller plates. Eventually four separate editions were published, as well as issues of proofs and prints without letterpress. The project was the first of Martin's many works in mezzotint, a medium which became an important alternative and a complementary activity for him to painting. The 24 preparatory oil sketches were discovered by the dealer and collector Robert Frank in 1951. \nThe present work illustrates the passage in book 10, beginning with line 108: \nCome forth. \nHe came, and with him Eve, more loath, though first \nTo offend discount'nanc'd both, and discompos'd;\nLove was not in their looks, either to God \nOr to each other, but apparent guilt, \nAnd shame, and perturbation, and despair,\nAnger, and obstinacy, and hate, and guile. \nWhence Adam faltring long, thus answer'd brief. \nI heard thee in the gard'n, and of thy voice \nAfraid, being naked, hid myself. \nThe story of Adam and Eve, both as told in the Bible and Milton's epic poem, had particularly appealed to Martin since his large painting of 'The Expulsion' exhibited at the BI in 1813. As Feaver comments, Martin's depiction of Paradise was first 'a trim, tranquil, arboretum' in 'The Approach of the Archangel Raphael' mezzotint (repr Feaver, pl 56) , while in the present work 'First Eve and then Adam debase themselves and feel ashamed; the oaks writhe sympathetically'. The last of the series, 'The Expulsion' (Weaver, pl 58), shows a rocky, primeval, and threatening landscape. The writhing branches of the trees in the present work follow the twisting figures of Adam and Eve, a feature which is more exaggerated in the mezzotint. The oil sketch also differs from the print in that there is less detail, particularly in the trees, and the contrast of light and dark is less intense. \n\tSets of three editions of Paradise Lost and several proofs are also in the museum collections.\n\nPROV: Robert Frank 1951; Thomas Laughton, his sale, Sotheby's 18 March 1964 (69); W J F Wing, from whom purchased by the museum 1969 \nEXH: \tTyneside's Contribution of Art Festival of Britain exhibition, Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle-upon-Tyne 1951 (197) \nENGR: Mezzotint published 1827 \n\nLIT: Balston pp95-100; Feaver pp72-83 \n\nREPR: (Mezzotint) Weaver, pl 57 \n\nRonald Parkinson\"",

Eventually four separate editions were published, as well as issues of proofs and prints without letterpress.
