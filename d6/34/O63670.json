            "history_note": "Attached to the sewing kit was a label inscribed by Margaret Rolfe \"Travelling case, needle-work.  Marie Taglioni\" and \"Margaret Rolfe\" another label indicates it did not belong to Taglioni.   It is difficult to establish how many of the tools in the kit, apart from the scissors which have a matching green leather case, are original.  The thimble is engraved with the monogram MR, which indicates that it belonged to Margaret Rolfe, but it does not fit the slot designed for it and is obviously not the original.  The pocket is filled with a selection of shaped ivory spools wound with various cottons, a composition needlecase and tiny ivory eggs, some marked \"Bruxelles\".\nThe sewing kit is part of a unique collection of memorabilia and personal effects which evoke  Marie Taglioni in the last decades of her life.  She was a keen needlewoman and the collection contains both examples of her own work and her personal sewing accessories. \nA collection of Taglioni memorabilia was amassed by Margaret Rolfe, the granddaughter of Taglioni's closest friend in London, Mrs Boggs Rolfe; she attended Taglioni's dancing classes and received many gifts of Taglioni memorabilia, from Taglioni herself, from her grandmother and, after Taglioni's death, from her niece, Marguerite Troubetzkoi.  She kept these, with a series of related notes, in various boxes and annotated envelopes (filed separately).  These she passed to Cyril Beaumont, probably for the London Archives of the Dance (a number of the objects were referred to in \"The London Archives of the Dance and some of its Treasures\" by Cyril Beaumont, Ballet Annual, first issue, Adam & Charles Black, London, 1947, p110); the Archives never achieved an independent home and part of the collection, including the Taglioni memorabilia, was stored with Cyril Beaumont, where it became inextricably mixed with his own collection and came to the Museum as part of the Cyril Beaumont Bequest.",
