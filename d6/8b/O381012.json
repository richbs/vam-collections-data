They were later identified as the work of the French bronzier and furniture maker Henry Dasson working in the late nineteenth century.\n\nHistorical significance: Henry Dasson was a celebrated furniture maker of the second half of 19th century who  specialised in making ormolu (gilt bronze) mounts. His work was mainly inspired by the art of the period of Louis XIV, Louis XV and Louis XVI style.\n\nIn 1870 he bought the company of Charles-Guillaume Winckelsen at 106, rue Vieille-du-Temple. The company closed in 1894. Dasson exhibited at international exhibitions including Paris in 1878 where he was lauded by Louis Gonse, (1846-1921), art critic and Director of the Gazette des Beaux-Arts, for the perfection of his work. Dasson won the Grand Prix Artistique, L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur for his work.",
