These have each a triangle of pulled thread edged with 2 narrow diagonal bands of small trellis pulled thread work topped with small reciprocal trefoil shapes in straight stitch.  Above this are 2 confronting bird motifs, either side of a small cypress tree which in turn is surmounted by a tiny bird motif - all in pulled thread.  The other 4 sides of this octagon have two or three stylized plant forms emerging from the reciprocal trefoil line. Framing this central area is a composite band of pulled thread organized in a zigzag pattern either side of a narrow straight stitch band of running zigzag, inverted so as to form a series of joined X-motifs. A line of small reciprocal trefoils finishes the decorative section.\nThe three raw edges have been rolled and stitched in place.\n\nCotton thread: probably Z-spun\nEmbroidery Thread: white silk; 2S",
