The plaques are delicately carved with 'arabesque' motifs, in two levels of relief. This style was characteristic of early Mamluk carving, and no two designs are identical. This minbar is also notable for containing no ivory plaques:  ivory inlay became popular on later Mamluk furniture (for example, on Sultan Qa'itbay's minbar, Museum no.1050-1869), but here the colour contrast is provided by the use of different woods.",

            "history_note": "These panels were acquired from the former collection of \"Arabian art\" owned by Gaston de Saint-Maurice, and which was exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1878. Other panels from the same minbar were acquired in 1869 by the Museum from the Meymar Collection, which had been exhibited in Paris in 1867 (1052-1869 and 1085-1869). The group of panels under the number 1052-1869 include inscribed panels bearing the name of Sultan Lajin and the date AH 696 (=1296).\n\nThe following is extracted from Stanley Lane-Poole, <u>Art of the Saracens in Egypt</u> (1886), pp.111-117:\n\n\u201cThe removal [of the minbar from the mosque of Ibn Tulun] must have been effected in comparatively recent times, for when Mr James Wild, the present Curator of Sir John Soane\u2019s Museum, was in Cairo, about 1845, the older pulpit was still standing; and he made a drawing of the geometrical arrangement of the panels, which is still preserved in his sketch-books, and which was turned to advantage some years ago, when the fragments of the pulpit-sides were acquired by the South Kensington Museum from M. Meymar. \n\n\u201cThis sketch shows that the side included one large circular geometric arrangement (comprising 8 large octagonal panels, carved alternately with stars and arabesques round a central star), and 4 half-systems of the same plan, 2 of which were placed so that their diameters coincided with the edge of the balustrade or border of the pulpit, while the other two touched the back. \n\n\u201cThe balustrade was of open lattice work, something like the narrow open panels in the K\u00e2\u00eft Bey pulpit engraved in fig.34, and the length of the base and back of the triangular portion of the side, occupied by the carved panels, was 15 feet 9 inches. The doors were filled with carved geometrical panels, with the usual arrangement of 2 horizontal panels, filled with Arabic inscriptions, one above and one below each door, and a longer inscription on the lintel.\n\n\u201cThe pulpit did not arrive in England in its original shape, but consisted merely of a collection of loose panels, which Mr Wild, with the help of his sketch, arranged in a [116] square, which now hangs on the walls of the Museum (no.1051); with the exception of a few pieces which remained over, and some of the horizontal panels, 2 of which contain the name of Sultan Lajin and the date of the erection of the pulpit, AH 696, while others are filled with scrollwork. Two of these are engraved in figs 39 and 40; one has an arabesque scroll, and the other the inscription \u2018Al-Malik al-Mansur Husam al-Dunya wa al-Din Lajin\u2019, \u2018The victorious king, sword-blade of the State and Church, Lajin\u2019.\n\n\u201cWhen the Museum acquired the magnificent collection of M. de St Maurice, in 1884, I was able to identify the fine panels which the late owner had fitted into the framework of a modern and ill-proportioned door as portions of the same pulpit, and some of these are engraved in figs 37 and 38.\n\n\u201cThe panels of Lajin\u2019s pulpit show Cairene carving in its boldest and finest style. Later arabesques may be more delicate and graceful, but no carvers in Egypt excelled those who made this pulpit, in freedom of design and skill of execution. As is [117] usual in the best Saracenic work, no two designs of this pulpit are absolutely identical: some fresh turn, some ingenious variation in the lines of the arabesque, show the independence of the artist from servile copying. The panels are enclosed by two thin lines of light-coloured wood inlaid in the darker wood of the panel, but the borders are not carved in the manner usual in later work, nor is there any ivory inlay.\u201d",

            "production_note": "Made for the restoration of the mosque of Ibn Tulun by Sultan Lajin (r. 1297-9). Dated 1296.", 
            "historical_context_note": "The plaques are delicately carved in two levels of relief, a characteristic of early Mamluk carving, and no two designs are identical. This panel is also notable for containing no ivory plaques:  ivory inlay became popular on later Mamluk furniture, but here the colour contrast is provided by the use of different woods.",
