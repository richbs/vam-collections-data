The leaves are heart-shaped or rounded and the flowers and buds are rendered in a stylised form in an overall orange colour which is achieved through a yellow ground with the detailing in hatched brush strokes in red.  The painting is framed with a plain inner border made of strips of buff-coloured paper with a black inner outline and a gold line on its outer edge with two narrow black ruled lines on the plain ivory-coloured main border.  This has margins of strips of buff-coloured  with a double row of black ruled lines.  A piece of beige woven textile has been added along the inner edge of the page as a gutter for the binding of the album.",

It contains 56 leaves on which are Mughal miniature paintings, drawing and flower studies on both sides. The binding is covered with an Indian brocade silk that may have been cut from lengths brought home by the 2nd Lord Clive, who served as Governor of Madras, 1799 to 1803.  The album was sold from Powis Castle at Sotheby's sale, 16 to 18 January 1956, lot 332A.",
