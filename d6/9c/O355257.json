            "physical_description": "Bodice and skirt of silk chiffon and fichu of tamboured net.\n\nBodice made of cream silk chiffon which is arranged in soft folds from the shoulders, and gathered in soft pleats round the back of the neck to give a bloused effect. The folds are fitted into a wide band of softly pleated chiffon at the waist, which is slightly wider at the front, and forms a shallow point at the centre point. The neckline is square and the sleeves are elbow length, set in and gathered on the shoulder, and finished at the elbow with two layers of chiffon ruffles. Both neckline and sleeves are trimmed with black velvet ribbon. The whole bodice and sleeves are lined with cream poplin and fastens with hooks and eyes down the centre front. There is a false front of pleated chiffon with chiffon rosettes and frills masking the hooks at the centre front. There are two chiffon rosettes at the neck edge. The bodice is boned with three bones in the back, four in the front and one at each side seam. On the inside of the bodice at the waist is a band of stiff white braid with a metal buckle at one end for adjusting the waist fitting. There are also two white ribbons at the neck edge for drawing the neckline to fit.\n\nThe skirt is full length with a slight train at the back. The chiffon is gathered into a band of silk at the waist. The skirt is very full with a central panel of tambour work on machine-made net and with a floral pattern. There is also an apron of net attached to the waist and the side panels. The central panel is trimmed with black velvet. There is a deep flounce of tambour work on net all round the skirt, and is trimmed with black velvet scallops and bows. The skirt is lined with cream taffeta silk with a double frill of accordion-pleated silk at the hem. The skirt has a further lining of stiff white muslin with a pleated frill and stiff cotton 'lace' trimming at the hem. There is an opening at the centre back of 9 inches and the waist band is secured by a large hook and eye.\n\nThe fichu is made of tambour work on a machine-made net. It consists of a long narrow crescent-shape panel with two side sections over the shoulders. The whole is trimmed with black velvet bands and a bow at each end.",
