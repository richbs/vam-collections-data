Pink with a white horizontal stripe and vertical stripes in maroon and yellow. \n\nThe robe has a bodice which meets at the centre front with squared off points at the waist. The sleeves are shaped to the elbow and gauged. The bodice and sleeves are lined with natural linen. There are waist tapes stitched at each side seam and the right hand side seam has a blue selvedge. At the centre back waist are two loops made from the bodice lining material for hanging the dress. The skirt which is unlined can be gathered 'en polonaise' with a short tape at either side of the back waist, a loop half way down the skirt and another short tape stitched below that. \n\nThe petticoat is of matching material and fastens at each hip with tape ties. There are several contemporary patches on the left hip.",

Using buttons and loops, the skirt of the gown was draped up to create a swathed effect at the back. Also introduced during this decade were a range of striped fabrics, often in a complex arrangement of colours with both sharp and shaded edges, as seen in this example. Other new developments were the ruched sleeve cuffs and bodices that meet in the centre, eliminating the need for a stomacher. This dress is shown with the skirt undraped, showing how the wearer had the choice of wearing the gown without the polonaise drapery.",
