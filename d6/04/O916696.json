            "bibliography": "<u>Victoria and Albert Museum Department of Engraving, Illustration & Design, Old English Pattern Books of the Metal Trades: A Descriptive Catalogue of the Collection in the Museum.</u> London: Printed under the Authority of His Majesty\u2019s Stationery Office, 1913.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n\"M. 63. m.\n\n<b>Marks.</b>--No name but inside cover \" Livre No. 70.\"\n\n<b>Description.</b>--A toolmaker's catalogue.   7\u00be in. by 11\u00bd in., 28 plates, some folding, and two pages (folded) of text.   No date, but a water mark 1798.   Original mottled and leather binding.\nE.126-1896.\n\n<b>Summary of Contents.</b>--Garden tools, pad tools (sets of tools with a handle common to all) bits, rimers, braces and bits for same, triangle stands or cats, tuning forks, steel toys, corkscrews, but crackers, button hooks, dog couples, key swivels, pliers, nail nippers, bed keys, compasses, hand-vices, turn-screws, prickers, toast forks, brass pastry cook's jiggers and tweezers, skates, pincers, pipes, sugar nippers, saw sets, fire steels, curling tongs and goffering irons, saddler's tools, steak tongs, boot hooks, cheese tasters, hammers, Italian irons, gun implements, spectacle cases, gun chargers, ladies' netting vices, punches for saddlers and corkscrews.\n\n<b>Comments.</b>--This volume contains more descriptive text than all the rest put together, though the notes are confined to \" Gentlemen's Garden Chests of Tools \" and boxes of tools for amateurs.   The descriptions are in English.  In order to get the set packed snugly in the chest, the handle for the fork (it was little better than a toast-fork), rake, hoe, and other tools was made interchangeable and in three parts.\n   Apart from tools, we have the class of goods known to the trade as \" steel toys.\"   Naturally there is no longer any demand for a good many of the articles enumerated--for example, spinet hammers, used for tuning the musical instrument of our great-grandmothers--while the recreation of the other sex is suggested by a number of tobacco stoppers.   Another almost forgotten form of domestic utensil is the fruit tongs, although a modification in the shape of the \" lazy coal tongs\" has come down to us.   An interesting example of this class of manufacture is the table cat, which consisted of a round ball with six arms standing out from it, so contrived that any three served as a foot, while the rest supported the hot dishes.   From another page some idea can be gathered of the kind of skates that were used 100 years ago.   They had wooden boards with a \" runner \" blade made in the approved way, but notched down at the heel to allow the screw to pass through it.   Only two strapholes were cut and buyers had the option of plain \" fluited \" or hollow ground finishes.   That manufacturers were as keenly alive to the necessity of getting business with novelties is shown by the inclusion among the designs of a steel tobacco pipe made with two extensive tubes with screwed ends, so that three parts made a \"church-warden \" of the metal indicated.   Sugar cutters remind us of the time when sugar was made in shaped moulds and brought from the West Indies in paper covers.   The sugar loaf used to add appreciably to the decorative effect of the grocer's window.   Spectacle-cases was another line, cheese-tasters might have been mentioned after the reference to the grocer's shop, while more curious than any other item were walking rods made in three parts with brass joints connecting the sections.
