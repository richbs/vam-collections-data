Apprenticed to a printer at Hull, moved to London 1805, entered the RA Schools 1807 and studied with Sir Thomas Lawrence. Early works were mainly portraits and nude studies; his first large figure composition was 'The Coral Finder' (1820). Exhibited 138 works at the RA between 1811 and 1850, and 77 at the BI 1811-47. Travelled abroad in 1815/6, 1822, and 1830, principally to Paris and Italy. Elected ARA 1824, RA 1828. A retrospective exhibition was held at the Society of Arts 1849. Died York 13 November 1849. His studio sale was at Christie's 6-10 and 13-14 May 1850. Most admired in his lifetime for his large mythological subjects, but now perhaps more appreciated for his less finished and smaller studies of the nude. \n\nLIT: A Gilchrist <i>Life of William Etty</i> 2 vols, 1855; W Gaunt and F G Roe <i>Etty and the Nude</i> Leigh-on-sea 1943; D Farr <i>William Etty</i> 1958 \n\n<b>Cupid Sheltering his Darling from the Approaching Storm</b> \nFA73 Neg 76797 \nPanel, oval, 43.1 x 33.6 cm (17 x 13\u00bc ins) \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nExhibited at the RA in 1822, and again in 1823 at the BI (the size given in the catalogue as '24 by 17 inches', presumably including the frame). Etty exhibited other similar subjects at the BI: 'Cupid and Psyche' (with a quotation from Milton's <i>Comus</i>) in 1821 (36.8 x 41.2 cm/14\u00bd x 16\u00bc ins, Farr no 50) and 'Cupid and Psyche Descending' in 1822 (96.5 x 73.6cm/38 x 29 ins, Farr under no 98). \n\nThe representation of Psyche as an infant is unusual, and the composition may have been inspired by paintings of the infant Jesus and St John the Baptist, or of putti; an early painting by Van Dyck of two putti is similar (National Museum, Stockholm) and was engraved in 1750 by J Daulle as 'L'Enfant Qui Joue Avec L'Amour'. \n\nGilchrist recorded that Etty 'set much store by this small picture; and with cause. It is a flawless piece of painter's-work, inimitably lovely; in sentiment, fresh, and captivating, as a Fancy of Drayton's or Herrick's.' He also noted the artist's dissatisfaction at the hanging of this picture at the RA, quoting a letter from Etty to the President Sir Thomas Lawrence: 'After having studied so many years, and with such application: a Picture I had spent three months about, - and carefully studied each part from Nature, should be judged worthy no better place than the Floor: to be hid by the legs of the spectators of a neighbouring and celebrated picture, and reflect its colour on their Boots'. \n\nPROV: According to the <i>Art Journal</i> of 1863, said to have been painted for Sir Francis Freeling, but this is presumably a confusion with 'Cupid and Psyche Descending' which was commissioned by him.
