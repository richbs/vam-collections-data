Ballen's first photographs were strongly led by his desire to define an aspect of South African culture.  This reflected his position as a newcomer, stepping into a marginalised community, foregrounding the socio-economic position that his subjects held. But in city photographs shown here, Ballen has moved further and further from attempting to document a culture. His photographs are powerful and complex because of this extreme aesthetic contemplation of a subject that we assume to be worthy of visualisation purely for its social meaning.  Ballen's recent photographs suggest a passion for texture and composition.  The starting point for the construction of an image could as easily be a dot on the wall, a dog's tail, or the teeth of the subject.  \n\n\"The purpose of photography has changed for me.  I am no longer an outsider trying to pick up interesting details of a place.  Right now, I'm only looking at one place - the interior of my mind.  And from that, I step outside.\""

In the late 1980s Ballen started documenting isolated white rural communities in South Africa who were in the process of losing the privileges of apartheid that had provided their livelihoods and sustained their identity. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the work shifted and Ballen\u2019s subjects started to act out tableaux for the camera, creating images that are intriguing and disturbing in equal measure. These photographs, which appear to aestheticise scenes of poverty, disrupt a documentary reading of the image and provoke the viewer to consider the role of the sitter: exploited victim or consensual participant?",
