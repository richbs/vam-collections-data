In fact, the chair is made of just three bent and pressed plywood elements simply slotted together.  Any sense of the material as wood is obliterated by the coat of polyester varnish, making it appear entirely synthetic.\n\nKartell was founded by Giulio Castelli, a chemical engineer, in 1949 and was at the forefront of plastics technology.  In 1964 Kartell first produced this chair and the first all-plastic chair, also designed by Colombo. This chair, therefore, sits at the cusp of the shift away from plywood (the material-of-choice for advanced designers since the 1930s) towards the new plastics.  In this chair, the old technology is masquerading as the new technique.",
