The 'Stations of the Cross' or 'Way of Sorrows', refers to the depiction of the final hours (or Passion) of Jesus. They took the shape of twelve panels, usually displayed around the nave of a catholic church, helping the faithful to make a spiritual pilgrimage of prayer, through meditating upon the chief scenes of Christ's sufferings and death. It has become one of the most popular devotions for Roman Catholics.\nTiles were a popular method of decorating churches in Portugal and many were commissioned from tile factories in the Netherlands.",
