Full citation: \n\n\u201c<b>Unknown Man\n</b><b>1675-80\n</b>P29-1952 \n\n<b>Oval 70.5 x 57 mm\n</b>\nFeatures stippled in brown, sanguine, blue and yellow, with some white heightening, on a pale carnation ground; hair in brown wash, hatched with darker colour and with gouache lights over the carnation; cravat in white with some brown hatching over a pale brown-grey wash; robe in blue washes modelled in dark brown; plain dark brown background; on vellum, probably originally put down on a leaf from a table-book. \n\n<b>Condition:</b> Covered, except for the face, with a varnish - probably glair (i.e., egg-white); the vellum now laid on modern card, which has buckled down the right side; multiple losses; probably extensively repainted in the hair and costume; the background shows traces of bright blue under unretouched losses; the whole evidently cut down. A note in the departmental file of February 1963 records that the secondary support at that date was copper. This would be interesting (for copper was a normal secondary support material for French water-colour miniaturists in the seventeenth century) but in the present instance probably indicates only an earlier phase of  'restoration', which possibly included the varnishing. \n\n<b>Signed:</b> Lower left, in yellow: <i>PC</i> (truncated). \n\n<b>Frame:</b> Nineteenth-century oval locket of copper-gilt, the slightly convex back soldered into a rim which is stepped inward with a curved section and two straight steps to the bezel, which holds the rounded edges of the shallowly convex glass; the hanger of rectangular section, grooved down the middle, the ends bifurcating and looping back into diminishing spirals of seven turns. \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> In 1865 in the possession of the 6th Earl of Chesterfield; evidently by descent with the title rather than the property after 1871, until c.1916; subsequently with HE Backer ( the dealer), from whom purchased by the Museum, September 1952. \n\n<b>Exhibited:</b> South Kensington 1865, no. 967 (as <i>Monmouth</i> ascribed to Cooper); Leeds 1868, no. 2988 (as <i>James, Duke of Monmouth</i> by S Cooper). \n\n<b>Literature:</b> Foster 1914-16, vol. II, p. 53, no. 333 (as <i>Monmouth</i> by Cooper); <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 13. \n\nNeither the identification nor the attribution to Cooper was believed by the Museum when this miniature was purchased. It was catalogued immediately as by 'Lawrence Crosse'. It is nonetheless difficult to see how an object in such poor condition could have been thought to add to the Museum's holding of work by this artist. Perhaps, since the date of the miniature seems to be in the later 1670s, it was thought early for 'Lawrence Crosse\u2019, and perhaps the form of the monogram seemed interestingly different from that of the other <i>\u2018LC\u2019</i> marks already in the collection. \n\nUnder all the restorations, however, it does seem possible to see the remains of a fine and characteristic work of Peter Cross's early maturity. The appearance of blue under the brown wash of the background remains puzzling. A blue background would have been unique in Cross's <i>oeuvre</i>, but perhaps as a restorer and copyist of old miniatures himself, he experimented with this archaising feature.\" ",
