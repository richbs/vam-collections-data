The embroidery has been cut on all four sides. Pieced, there is a seam down the length about 13 cm in from the right hand side. This has disrupted the design.\nDirectional design with the top of the pattern at the bottom of the panel, so that the wearer saw the correct pattern. The museum Number is in the lower right hand corner but has been sewn with its length running along the right hand side of the panel. There is evidence that there was a border along the bottom but not enough has survived to be described. \n\nThe main pattern is a series of diagonal lines from lower right to upper left.  These are chevron lines in dark green and dark blue.\n\nThere are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: straight stem with red trefoil flower pointing down or to the right.\n[2] wider stripes in two designs: [a] from a pink trefoil base, facing right, a straight striped stem with small grey flowers surrounded by pink and by blue flowers.  This alternates with a grey trefoil base facing down with 3 grey flowers and then pink and blue flowers.\n[b] straight downward pointing stem with pink diamond shaped flower with 9 small grey flowers along its outer edges alternating with a right-pointing curved stem from a trefoil base with a pointed red flower.\n\nThreads: silk; 2S; pink, light pink, yellow, light blue, white, dark green, blue, grey, light green, light grey. The grey has probably faded from a much  more vibrant colour - perhaps a purple? Almost certainly a synthetic dye.",
