In 1974 he created a video called the Florence Tapes, which includes a section entitled Walking. The artist's bare feet were shown on a television monitor and the viewer was encouraged to walk on the screen, so that their feet touched. \n\nFeet to Feet is one of a set of six prints from the Keeping Time series, created in 1976 and influenced by the Florence Tapes. A television monitor and feet can be seen at the centre of the image, underneath the darker footprints. Davis used a variety of printing techniques to create the effect, including his own hands and feet. \n\nEach print in the series also includes the dates and times when each stage of the process was undertaken, thus emphasising the time-based nature of the work.",
