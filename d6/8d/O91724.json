Its special form indicates it was made for a cathedral, the church which contains the official seat of the bishop in a diocese. The engraved silver plaques would originally have been enamelled with bright, translucent colours. On the front of the cross, scenes of Christ's final hours and of His Resurrection are arranged above the cast and applied figure of the crucified Christ. The plaque at the top of the cross which depicts a pelican plucking at its breast is symbolic of Jesus's sacrifice. On the back of the cross is the cast and applied figure of Christ in Majesty, His hand raised in blessing, surrounded by the symbols of the four Evangelists who recorded His life in the Gospels. The awkward proportions of this figure suggest it may not be original to the cross, while the large knop typically found at the base of processional crosses (to facilitate carrying them) is missing.",

Although a figure emerging from a coffin is a standard iconographical type in this context, and represents the resurrection of Adam, the First Man, it is more usual for him to be depicted naked, or throwing off his shroud.\nThe cross was almost certainly made for a cathedral, as in Spain only churches of this regional importance were authorised to use this double-armed processional type. At a later date, probably in the nineteenth century, the figures of the Crucified Christ and Christ in Majesty were applied (the Christ in Majesty covers a missing central plaque). The quatrilobed plaque of St Matthew, above the Crucified Christ, is a nineteenth-century replacement and incorrectly duplicates the medieval plaque of St Matthew at the foot of the cross (the replacement should have depicted St John). The plaque above the Crucified Christ, engraved 'JHS', has been crudely soldered to the edge of one of the gilded strips of metal covering the cross. The cross was bought in London in 1915 by the collector Walter Leo Hildburgh, and entered the V&amp;A in 1956 after his death as part of his bequest to the Museum.",
