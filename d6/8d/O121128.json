The guls are stepped octagons outlined in dark blue and quartered.  The outer quarters are diagonally red and white and have 3 stylised flowers extending into them from the centre.  The inner quarters are diagonally dark red and either dark blue or dark green with one stylised flower coming from a small stepped octagon containing a quartered rectangle.  The blue lines of the quarterings extend to form a grid throughout the field and along them, horizontally, are small blocks in yellow.  The outlines of the stepped guls are dark blue and dark green.  Offset between the guls are alternately dark blue and dark green hooked crosses with a small x-motif; all coming from a central rosette of white and red petals.  Note: under the secondary are sometimes various small decorative fillings.\n\nThere is no border along the top and only part of the inner borders along the right hand side.\n\nMain border: dark red ground divided into compartments with an octagon containing a variety of 8-pointed rosettes and stars alternates with either a double-geometrical device, primarily in white and red, or a rectangle containing two converging chevrons outlined in white.\n\nInner and outer border: dark red ground with diagonal blocks of colour.\n\nInnermost border (only along the sides): red ground with narrow horizontal blocks of colour on a central brown vertical line.",
