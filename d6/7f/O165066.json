This may have been worked to this stage and sold so that it could be completed at home.  All the outlines have been done; all the colours have been included.\nDirectional design with the top of the pattern at the bottom of the panel, so that the wearer saw the correct pattern. The Museum Number is in the top left hand corner. There is a border along the bottom.  Flowers pointing to the lower left.  One flower with red 'fingers' next to a small yellow flower alternating with red and blue flower next to a small yellow flower. There is a line above, below and extending part way up the sides - created by simple diagonal stitches but there is indication in the lower left hand corner that small black stitches should be worked across them to create the pattern.  Up the sides there is a pattern of diamonds within the diagonal lines.\n\nThe main pattern is a series of diagonal lines from lower right to upper left.  These are chevron lines in dark green; there is no indication of what the second colour would be.\n\nThere are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: lots of light green; black flower outline pointing down or slightly to the right; light blue flower outline pointing to the upper right or bottom left; orange flower outline with red details in centre.\n[2] wider stripes in two designs: [a] 2 segments: downward pointing large pointed flower, blue centre, green and white outline, on angled green stem with adjacent segment filled with small multi-coloured outlines, pale colours with 2 black stars. The 2nd segment contains darker colours and a mass of smaller outlines.\n[b] Divided into diamond sections: both contain downward pointing flower outline, one white with red centre and one red with light blue centre.\nThere is a small orange and white embroidered motif in the bottom right hand corner below the border.\n\nThreads: silk; 2S; black, dark green, red, light blue, mauve, light green, white, orange, dark pink.",
