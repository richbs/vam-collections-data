[This is a garbled version of a text from the Bible, Luke 12:3, which actually runs in the King James Bible as: - `...that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.']  There was a subtitle to the picture: - `Stepping from the doorway that opened on the roof, the mistress of the mansion clapped her hands, and the neighbouring portion of that aerial population came flocking across the narrow boundaries and low parapets of the housetops to listen to the tale of scandal just narrated to us, etc., etc..\nThe reviewer of the 1867 exhibition for the Art Journal wrote of Elmore's `recent journey to Algiers' (AJ, June 1867, p.137).  Since Elmore had not exhibited at the RA in 1866, his visit to Algeria was presumably during that year. \nSee also SD.1351.",
