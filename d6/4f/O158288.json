The museum Number is in the top left hand corner. No borders survive. A band of white cotton tape has been applied around the piece on the front and it has been backed with blue cotton.\n\nThe main pattern is a series of diagonal lines from lower right to upper left.  These are chevron lines in green and dark green.\nThere are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: white iris pointing to lower left or upper right on a curved striped stem alternating with an arrangement of a white-pointed blossom with a blue centre surrounded by  3 orange flowers, the whole forming a small rectangle.  The pointed blossom points either to the right or straight up.\n[2] wider stripes in two designs: [a] 3 designs all in the form of diamonds: slightly indistinct but one contains a 6-petalled blue flower in the centre; one has a small pointed blue cone-like motif pointing to the lower right; the third has no real features. The background of all is a mass of orange/yellow flowers and green leaves.\n[b] 4 designs in diamonds: pointed flower pointing straight down on an angled chevron stem with 5 small blossoms around its pointed end for a V-shape; a large circular arrangement of orange/yellow blossoms pointing to the right with a pair of leaves at the base of a short stem; a pointed blossom facing right on an angled chevron stem with several large blossoms forming a diamond around it; the 4th may be a repeat of the 2nd but facing downwards, or it may be a slight variation - it isn't clear.\n\nThreads: silk; 2S; difficult to identify the colours as it is backed but they include dark blue, blue, red, yellow, green, dark green, white, beige and orange.\nSee also 751-1888 which is the pair to this panel.",
