It fully exploited the materials made by the factory, as the shell is moulded entirely from polyurethane.  The chair was intended for use in the garden, and the folding lid protected the upholstery from the weather when it was not in use.\n\nThe West German manufacturer licensed production to an East German company, VEB Synthesewerk Schwarzheide near Senftenberg.  It was mass-produced for only three years because the lacquering of the shell remained problematic and, at 430 DM, it was too expensive for the East German market.  This example, acquired from the designer, is date stamped 9 June 1971, telling us it was a prototype made in West Germany before the licence to manufacture it in the East was signed.",
