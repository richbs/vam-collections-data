The President at the time, Theodore (\u201cTeddy\u201d) Roosevelt, was portrayed in a political cartoon that appeared in the Washington Post in November 1902 refusing to shoot a small bear that had been captured for him to kill. The cartoonist, Clifford Berryman, continued to associate Roosevelt with this endearing bear in his cartoons. Morris Mitchom, a New York shopkeeper and founder of the Ideal company, is credited with making a soft toy bear and calling it \u201cTeddy\u2019s Bear\u201d as a tribute to the President. By 1906, the term teddy bear had become widely accepted in the United States and Europe.",
