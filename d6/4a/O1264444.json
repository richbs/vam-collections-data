She initially trained in fine art in Bushey with Hubert von Herkomer, and then, about 1893, moved to  Paris. There, she found encouragement and many subjects for her work, which focused on still lives and nudes, but mostly portraits of women with children. She exhibited at the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Beaux Arts in Paris and the Salon des Tuilleries. \n\nHow was remarkable for being 'The Modern British Artist whose work was bought most often by  museums and the state' in France (Meslay, 2000). Her paintings are held in many French collections,  as well as in the Tate Gallery in Britain. How's work is concerned with capturing light,  luminescence and texture, and her subjects are everyday, domestic scenes. The framing of the nurse and child in this painting, as in many of her works, creates an atmosphere of intimacy but also concentration.",
