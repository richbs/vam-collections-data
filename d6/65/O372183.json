The design of this armchair - with turned front legs, solid seat and inlaid back panel with some carving - probably originated in the last quarter of the 16th century, but seems to have remained popular for a century, especially in northern England. This example is in suspiciously good condition for a chair over 200 years old, and may have been heavily rebuilt, probably between 1850-1920, or actually created at this time, perhaps marrying 17th-century legs and arms to a newly carved crest and inlay panel.",
