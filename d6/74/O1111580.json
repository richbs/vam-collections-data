His white-painted face is detailed with black eyebrows and eyes, a red mouth and four red dots - one in his forehead, one on his chin, and one on each cheek.  He wears a parti-coloured jacket, the front divided into a pink cotton half and a light grey cotton half, with one pink sleeve and one light grey, the grey with a mauve velvet cuff and the pink with remnants of a red cotton cuff.  There are red trims at the botton the calf-length breeches which are of a diamond-checked pink and mauve fabric.  He wears a pale green ruff around his neck and there is a band of matching green cotton at the end of his jacket. The dark grey woollen sleeve which concealed the Professor's hand forms the back of the Clown's jacket.",
