The frame has been coarsely repainted and the gilding is apparently no older than the nineteenth century Inscribed in ink, on the backboard: &lt;i&gt;SrW Portman [ ...

Full Citation:\n\n\u201c<b>97 Sir William Portman, Bart, KB, FRS</b>\n(b.1641 d.1690) \n<b>1650-60</b> \nEvans 35\n\n<b>Oval 75 x 61 mm</b> \n\nFeatures in brown and sanguine, diagonally hatched with grey-blue, and with white in the eyes, on a very pale carnation ground; hair in brown wash, hatched with darker colour and with the lights in pale gouache, also over the carnation; cravat in pale brown wash, modelled and with the lights in thick white and the shadows in grey; armour in brown wash, hatched with grey and black, the lights in white and yellow for the studs; background in ochre, washed over with earth-colour hatched heavily with dark brown; on vellum put down on pasteboard. \n\n<b>Condition:</b> Some fading in the face; a zinc-white retouch in the forehead; some water damage causing gum accretions in the background and hair; minor abrasions and flaking. \n\n<b>Signed:</b> Not signed. \n\n<b>Frame:</b> Probably seventeenth-century turned oval, ivory painted black; a complex series of mouldings, rising from a short straight outer side, inward and upward at the front to a glazed rebate, gilded on the inner edge against the convex glass; backboard of pearwood, marked with concentric ovals, set in a copper ring. The frame has been coarsely repainted and the gilding is apparently no older than the nineteenth century Inscribed in ink, on the backboard: <i>SrW Portman [ ... J Daughter to Sr John / Cutler;</i> the inscription partly erased. \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> Acquired by the Hon. F HA Wallop from an unrecorded source, and lent to the Museum 1930-49; given to Alan Evans, June 1933, and by him bequeathed to the National Gallery, 1974; placed on indeterminate loan at the Museum. (See Appendix 3.) \n\n<b>Exhibited:</b> Grosvenor Place 1932 (as by D Gibson). \n\n<b>Literature:</b> <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 24; Murdoch and Murrell 1981, p. 287; Murdoch 1981, p. 133, pl. 2Sb. \n\nThe attribution to D Gibson was made by Long during his correspondence with Captain C M H Pearce about the identity of the miniaturist D G. Long noticed that the Portman lent by Wallop and Sir Richard Anderson 1 owned by Pearce were by the same hand. The miniature is indeed characteristic of Gibson in the late 1650s, a dating supported by the way the neckcloth is knotted. The identification rests on the inscription, which should perhaps be treated with some reserve, as there has evidently been some effort to cancel it; the frame has also been subjected to 'restoration' , and the backboard, with its concentric ovals, does not seem to have been cut as a fresh piece of timber for this object. On the other hand, as inscriptions on frames go, it is plausible, and the attempt at erasure may simply reflect the sitter's marital history. \n\nSir John Cutler's daughter Elizabeth (by his second marriage) was the first of three wives of Sir William Portman of Orchard Portman in Somerset. She brought to the Portmans her mother's substantial portion, and ultimately (after 1693) the rest of the Cutler fortune. All of Sir William's matches were advantageous, and when he died in 16902 he was one of the richest and most influential of the West Country Tories. The DNB contains an account of his capture of the Duke of Monmouth after Sedgemoor, and of his subsequent transfer of allegiance to William of Orange at Exeter in November 1688. Gibson catches him as a young soldier, well before his twentieth birthday. \n\n1 Repro.Murdoch 1981, fig. 145.\n2 1695 according to Burke 1831.\" ",
