She saw haute couture as an art form and patronised many couture houses. \n\nShe gave dozens of items to the V&A, including pieces by Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga (1895-1972), Chrisitan Dior (1905-57), and Hubert de Givenchy (b.1927).  Amongst these famous names were several lesser known labels, such as Jeanne Lafaurie (house dates 1928-58). This is the only dress by Lafaurie in the V&A's collection.",

Born in Mexico as Gloria Rubio, her first husband was a Count Furstenberg, to whom she was married at the behest of the German art collector, Freddy Horstmann.  Her second husband was an Egyptian by the name of Fakhry, and her third husband, the banker Loel Guinness.  In many ways she was unhappy as his wife, as she loved to party and he did not.  She gave an enormous number of items from Balenciaga, Dior Courreges, Lanvin Castillo, Givnehy Hellstern and Jeanne Lafaurie, proving that she spresad her commissions amongst many different couturiers.  Among the 17 outfits, 12 hats and pairs of shoes that she donated were a 1948 Balenciaga evening gown (T.16-1974) of organdie with flack flowers, a 1949 hand-painted evening gown by Marcelle Chaumont (T.92-1974), and a 1950s evening gown by Jeanne Lafaurie (T.281-1974), the only dress by that designer in the V&A's collection.",
