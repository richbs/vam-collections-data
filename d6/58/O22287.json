Although now detached, this panel would have originally formed part of the sumptuously embroidered over-robe worn by a bride in the final act of marriage: her entry into her husband\u2019s family home and formal introduction to her new relatives.\n\nSuch panels were embroidered by the bride and her female relatives in the months before this important ritual took place. They were decorated with auspicious motifs, as in this example, with its design of cranes, small birds, butterflies, lotuses, peonies and a potted peach tree, signifying, among other things, wishes for longevity and marital bliss for the newly married couple.",
