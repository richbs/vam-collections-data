With a brass nozzle.\n\nThe front board (and front face of the rear handle), and the edges of both are decorated with inlay of brass stringing forming a small-scale floral pattern of scrolling stems. Five convex mother of pearl bosses depict the figure of Venus accompanied by two putti (central, surrounded by a sunburst border), and the Four Elements. On the handle is a sixth (flat) plaque engraved with a male profile head (possibly a portrait).\n\nThe exposed back surfaces are plain, with three round air-intake hole. Leather band is secured by a mix of large, rounded headed brass nails (replacement) and, where the boards join, small brass nails with a distinctive star motif, presumed to be original.\n\nThe inlay work is particularly precise, and high quality.\n\nThe bellows fitted with a modern mount (2013).",
