He exhibited 129 works at the Royal Academy between 1799 and 1844, and 14 at the British Institute between 1806 and 1838. He was elected a Royal Academician in 1810.  \n\nCallcott painted a variety of subjects, including portraits, genre scenes and literary and historical works.  However, he is best known for his picturesque landscapes influenced by Gainsborough and 17th century Dutch painting and Classical landscapes in the manner of Claude.  From 1815 he exhibited mainly coastal and marine subjects such as this, prompting comparisons with the Dutch artist Albert Cuyp and J.M.W. Turner.  Callcott had a close association with Turner and this painting, with its low view point, is reminiscent of Turner's work between 1800 and 1810.",

First studied music in the Westminster Abbey choir, then painting with John Hoppner RA; entered RA Schools 1797. Exhibited 129 works at the RA between 1799 and 1844, and 14 at the BI 1806-38. A few early exhibits were portraits, but he soon achieved success with picturesque landscapes influenced by Gainsborough and 17th-century Dutch painting. From about 1815 exhibited principally coastal and marine subjects; his work was compared to that of Aelbert Cuyp and, especially, Turner, with whom he had a close association. Also painted classical landscapes in the manner of Claude, and a variety of genre, humorous, literary and historical subjects. Travelled abroad, notably in 1827-8 following his marriage to Maria Graham, a writer of art and travel books and most famous for <i>Little Arthur's History of England</i> (1835). Elected ARA 1806, RA 1810, knighted 1837. Served on committees for the Government Schools of Design and the National Gallery, and was appointed Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures 1843. Died Kensington 25 November 1844; his studio sales of drawings and watercolours were at Christie's 8-12 May 1845 and 22 June 1863. Although in his lifetime his work commanded high prices and attracted the leading patrons of the day, it was not always well received by the critics, particularly in later years; Ruskin wrote that 'he painted everything tolerably, and nothing excellently'. \n\nLIT: \t<i>Athenaeum</i> 17 December 1831, pp817-8, 30 November 1844, pp1097-8 (obit); <i>Art Union</i> 1845, p15 (obit); <i>Art Journal</i> 1856, p9, 1866, p99, 1896, p334; J Dafforne <i>Pictures of Sir A W Callcott</i> ... nd [1875] (referred to below as Dafforne); <i>Portfolio</i> 1875, p161; DB Brown <i>Augustus Wall Callcott</i> Tate Gallery exhibition catalogue 1981 (with full bibliography and list of archival sources) (referred to below as Brown) \n\n<b>A Brisk Gale - A Dutch East-Indiaman Landing Passengers</b>\nFA9 Neg 59315 \nCanvas, 66.7 x 104.1 cm (26\u00bc x 41 ins) \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nExhibited with the above title at the RA in 1830. The <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> found 'the distant sea view ... charmingly given, and the fore-part of the picture presents all the reality of a sandy beach covered with muddied water'. Dafforne describes the action: 'At the entrance of a port or harbour, the two extremities of which are in the foreground of the composition; some small Dutch-built vessels are making for the shelter: these are on the left of the picture; on the right lies the Indiaman broadside to the spectator. The ship is of enormous length, and low down in the water, as if heavily laden with merchandise from the Dutch settlements in the East; a small sailing-boat with passengers has, apparently, just left her; a row-boat has reached the end of one pier and the boatmen are landing a single passenger with his luggage. There is effective play of cloud and sunshine in the sky, nicely reflected as light and shade on the water'. \n\nThe painting, and particularly the low viewpoint, is reminiscent of the work of J M W Turner 1800-10, such as his 'Calais Pier' of 1803 (NG). \n\nEXH: \tRA 1830 (172) \n\nLIT: <i>\tGentleman's Magazine</i> 100, part 1, 1830, p446; <i>Dafforne</i> p49 \n\nREPR: T C Dibdin <i>Sir Augustus Wall Callcott's Italian and English Landscapes. \tLithographed by T C Dibdin</i> 1847, p.1X; <i>Sheepshanks Gallery</i> 1870\"",
