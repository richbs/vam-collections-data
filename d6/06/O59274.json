In fact the chair is a fake. The faker has taken the frame of a genuine chair from this set and decorated it in a much grander fashion. The foot mounts, for instance, were designed for a table, and close inspection of the sides of the front legs shows that they have had to be built out to make them thick enough to fit the mounts.",

In 1826 they were sent from the Chateau de Saint Cloud to the Garde Meuble.  This very grand, throne form, was presumably built up on the carcase of one of this set in about 1870-80.  Evidence of thickening of the legs is clear and the only use by the firm of Jacob of this particular foot mount is on tables. The model may be the giltwood chairs designed for the Throne Room at the Palais de Tuileries in 1804 by Percier and Fontaine, supplied by Jacob on 1 December 1804, the day before the coronation of Napoleon as Emperor. One of this set was sold by Sotheby's, London, 7 July 2009.  The portrait of Jerome Bonaparte, King of Spain, painted by Fran\u00e7ois Pascal Simon G\u00e9rard in 1810 (Chateau de Versailles) shows a throne with a cresting very similar to this chair.",
