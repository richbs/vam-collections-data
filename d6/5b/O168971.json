The sprig comprises a central stem with 2 fruit like buds and it ends with an upright flowerhead.  There are many leaves and the lowermost bunch hang down. The metal thread is silver-gilt close S-wound on a yellow silk core, woven with twill binding.\nThe border is pieced using two different fabrics. [1] Corner squares: have a pink satin ground with large, almost circular botehs in offset rows, curving to the right.  Each is composed of many small details in metal thread [silver strip close S-wound on a light yellow silk core]. [2] Sides; gold ground with a small scale pattern in which fine white lines form coiling stems linking small and large pink rosettes and large and small mauve star-like flowers, with small green leaves. The existence of diagonal seams suggests this fabric was originally part of a garment.\nBacking: red cotton twill.\nFacing: bias cut, red and blue plain weave cotton.\nA small brass ring has been sewn to each of the lower corners.",
