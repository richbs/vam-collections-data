With a scratch-moulding of triple-reeding on the outside of the legs and on the underside of the rails.\n\nConstruction\nJoined construction, double-pegged, with floating linenfold panels. The framework displays a type of 'mason's mitres', with the rails straight-edged where they receive stiles and muntins, although mitres are not actually attempted (possibly a cause for suspicion).\n\nThe bottom consists of 6 boards grained front to 'back', 3 of which appear to be replacements (but the bottom may have been completely restored, using some old wood). These may be joined at bird's-mouth (V) joints, but if they are butted there are none of the expected gaps or wear between them. These rest on a deep (c10mm) rebate cut on the inside of the lower rail, but it is not fully clear how these are fixed (though there are traces of glue on their undersides): rusty nail heads are visible at the ends (inside the chest) but these do not apparently fix the bottom boards to the lower rails. \n\nThe top of two sawn planks (butted and presumably dowelled), chamfered along the edges, with a replaced batten at either end held on four large dowels.\n\nModifications\nDescribed on acquisition: 'The chest has been altered, having at one time had a hinged top. Two hinge marks can be seen on the back of the chest, and on the front is a loop for a padlock, no longer functional owing to the reconstruction of the top. The top, as now restored, slides on runners. Both runners and bearers are new. The top, has bevelled edges which show signs of having been cut recently. The restoration carried out by Messrs. Wolsey'\n\nThe left bottom rail is noticeably fresher than the other rails, but the joints do not appear to have been disturbed.",
