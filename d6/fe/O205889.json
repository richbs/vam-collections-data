As executed the elevation differed in several respects from this drawing. It was newly finished in 1722 when the antiquary, William Stukely, sketched it and it stood on the north east corner of the field.  The house was demolished in 1902.  \n\nThis drawing is part of the Vanbrugh Album from the Library at Elton Hall. The Album contains 254 drawings and includes works by Sir John Vanbrugh, Sir Edward Lovett Pearce, William Talman, Nicholas Hawksmoor, Richard Castle and anonymous draughtsmen in Vanbrugh's office. It was created ca. 1945-54 and was purchased by Victoria and Albert Museum in 1992.",
