The two halves of the shell produced an ideal size of teapot, and was made in salt-glazed stoneware as well as red earthenware.\n\nDesign & Designing\nMoving on from early dependence on Chinese prototypes, the potters of Staffordshire embraced elements of the Rococo style. Exotic and sophisticated hollow forms such as pectin-shell teapots could be moulded very cheaply, the limiting factor being the necessity to hide the non-matching joints. This teapot perfectly demonstrates the potters' skill and design sense, partly concealing the mould-lines beneath the handle and spout and avoiding the use of a separate foot.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe appearance of so-called 'agate' ware (veined pottery intended to resemble the hardstone) varied greatly, according to the whim of the potter or the needs of the object to be made. Tight multi-coloured or simple two-colour patterns could be formed by wedging coloured clays together, cutting and rolling them like pastry. The finished sheets of clay could only be press-moulded - even globular teapots were made in two hemispheres and joined around the middle. If thrown on the wheel, like some country pottery, 'agate' clay produced a muddy spiral effect.",
