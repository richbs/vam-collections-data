The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine of 1862 stated, 'A great revolution has taken place in the chaussure (shoe)...for the black shoe or boot...coloured ones are substituted, to accord nicely with the dresses.  We have noticed some...in blue, violet, scarlet and green morocco.'  \n\nThis lime green lady's court shoe is a good example of the sort of bright colours that were available during the 1860s even though it was actually produced in the next decade, by which time boldly coloured shoes were slipping out of fashion again.  The shape of the heel of this shoe was known as a 'semi louis'.  This type of heel was introduced during the nineteenth century and derived its name from the heeled shoes worn by Louis XV, King of France from 1715-1774.",
