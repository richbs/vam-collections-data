All are worn to hold the hair off the face to some extent, as well as to provide decoration, although this circular type of elasticated  headband seems to have become particularly popular for wear by babies, who often have little or no hair.  \n\nHair bands have been in use from at least the 1450s.  The terms hair band and head band are descriptive; the alice band is named from the one worn by Alice in Tenniel's illustrations to Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There (1871) by Lewis Carroll; bandeau comes from bande or bandel, a French equivalent.",
