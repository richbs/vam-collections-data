This practice was doubtlessly inspired partly by the Indian tradition of using tiger and leopard claws in amuletic jewellery, but was a form of trophy jewellery for Victorian women. European men may have commissioned such jewellery after a successful hunting expedition to present to women; such jewellery was also probably made for sale to tourists. This brooch was probably in the possession of Dr James Stevenson (1794-1866), a surgeon in the Madras Presidency.",
