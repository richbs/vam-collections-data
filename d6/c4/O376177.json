The designs varied from valley to valley.  This necklace is typical of eastern Switzerland.   The small oval links are made from silver filigree, which gives it its Swiss name of Bl\u00e4ttlikette, or chain of little leaves.  Silver filigree is very common in Swiss traditional jewellery, and chains like this were hung over the apron and under the arms, as well as round the neck.\n\nThis necklace would originally have been tied round the neck of its owner with a black velvet ribbon threaded through the loops at each end.",
