In 1881 this screen was one of several designs by the firm selected for illustration and praise by the magazine. By 1897 Model & Co. were described by the magazine as among the aristocrats of bamboo manufacturers.\n\nMaterials & Making\nIn  1881 The Cabinet Maker and Art Furnisher commented on the astonishing popularity of bamboo furniture. Exotic materials, such as bamboo or lacquer panels, were imported from Japan and then combined with native flora and fauna in fashionable furnishings like this screen. Stuffed birds, Japanese or Chinese embroidery and stained and leaded glass was also used for screens made of bamboo by Model & Co.",
