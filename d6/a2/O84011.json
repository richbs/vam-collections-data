Sir Arthur Phayre, Commissioner of British Burma, accompanied the mission and acted as interpreter. \n\nThese three watercolours, which were presented to the Victoria and Albert Museum by the great niece of Sir Arthur Phayre, allow us to witness the pomp with which Burmese ministers travelled through the eyes of a Burmese court artist, who accompanied the mission.\n\nAt the third meeting in Calcutta, the ambassador is again shown with his entourage carrying his swords, gold umbrellas and receptacles of rank, but he is portrayed in a more relaxed mode, seated with Sir Arthur Phayre. His elaborate robes and headdress (see IS.179-1950 & IS. 181-1950) have been exchanged for items of dress that were worn by all classes of Burmese society--varying only in degree of costliness of fabric.
