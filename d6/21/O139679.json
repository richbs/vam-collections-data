            "public_access_description": "The parasol was a popular accessory during the 19th and early 20th century, a period when sun tanned was highly undesirable. It functioned both as a sunshade and a fashionable accompaniment to dress, distinguishing itself from the umbrella through its infinite and luxurious forms and essentially feminine status. Like the earlier trend for fans parasols displayed an individual's style and could be used in a coquettish ritual to hide the modest bearer from unwanted glances.\n\nThe 1920s were the swansong of the parasol. The new age of sun worship combined with increasingly covered automobiles made it far less desirable than it once was. This en-tout-cas (cross between an umbrella and a parasol) is typical, with a plain waterproofed silk cover and elaborate carved ivory handle. Throughout the 20s shades became shorter, roughly half the length of the previous decade. All were fitted with straps at the handle end for wearing around the wrist, either attached through a small ring, or threaded through a hole in the stick like this cord example. Bird-head designs, such as this budgerigar were also common at this time. This is a replica of an en-tout-cas presented in 1926 to Queen Mary, who was renowned for her use of parasols and en-tout cas.",
