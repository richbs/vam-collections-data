To reflect its new status, there was a rise in public buildings which included new mosques, tombs and grand houses. These buildings all required impressive tilework and attracted skilled tilemakers from throughout Syria. Tiles from this period are exuberant and lively, with a distinctive vibrant palette, loosely derived from Iznik tile work.\n\nIn the 19th century, Damascus tile work was discovered by English collectors suchs as Lord Leighton, who furnished his house in Holland Park, Leighton House, with tiles. In turn this fashion inspired Arts and Crafts designers, such as WIlliam de Morgan, to copy these 16th century designs and invent their own designs. The peacock was an important motif of the Arts and Crafts Movement.",
