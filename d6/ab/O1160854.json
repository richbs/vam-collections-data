There is a small amount of detail moulded into the plastic indicating different segments of the tractor and the fender and lights.

The tractor is in relatively good condition, although there are some scratch marks to the metal sections. The chimney and funnel have been spray painted black over the orange and this is now beginning to scratch off and reveal the orange plastic underneath.",
