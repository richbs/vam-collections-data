A white plastic adjustable feeding tray attaches to the safety bar, and a brushed metal and white plastic inverted 'T'-shaped footrest can also be connected to the seat. The safety bars, tray and footrest can be removed. The circular base is formed from metal and white plastic. The seat connects to the base via a metal pneumatic shaft sliding into a white plastic column rising from the centre of the base which connects to two arms which curve around the lower half of the seat, from their fixing points at either side of the seat. These are also in brushed metal, with the shaft in stainless steel. The height of the seat can be adjusted using a white plastic clamp at the base of the shaft, the seat can be rotated through 360 degrees using a white plastic clamp joining the arms with the shaft, and can be pivoted on its arms and locked in a number of positions ranging from the horizontal to more vertical. There are also wheels enclosed within the base.",

This particular 'loft' model has been designed to be taller, allowing children to sit at breakfast bars or kitchen work tops rather than tables. The chair also comes with a detachable food and play tray. \n\nBloom is based in Hong Kong and was founded by four dads who believe parents and baby should live together in style.

It was acquired for use in the V&A Museum of Childhood 'Sit Down' exhibition 2010.\n\nHistorical significance: This chair is marketed as the 'only contemporary chair that stays with baby from birth to school age'. It has won numerous design awards, and reflects a contemporary attitude to considered and well-designed baby products, and the contemporary popularity of eating at breakfast bars rather than tables in modern, loft-style kitchens.",
