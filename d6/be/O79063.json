It  formed part of the decoration of Essex House, Putney, London, the residence of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex (1566-1601).\n\nPeople\nThe Earl of Essex was a favourite of Elizabeth I from about 1586 until he fell from grace in 1600, after his brief and unsuccessful posting as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. He then instigated a  rebellion against the Queen which  resulted in his execution in 1601. The ceilings of Essex House, built when he was very much in favour, were decorated with royal symbols, such as 'ER' monograms and the Queen's emblem of a falcon carrying a sceptre.\n\nPlace\nPutney House was built in about 1590 and demolished in 1872. It  would have provided a convenient rural base, close to  London and the court. The medallion is modelled in a sophisticated style that reflects the tastes of the court.",

She explains that the ceiling is from Essex House, High Street, Putney - said to have been built and occupied by Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex.  When the house was taken down (more than 30 years earlier) the ceiling was used a jewellers shop that was built on the site at 127 High Street.  When the shop was altered \"a few years ago\" the ceiling was stored in the jewellers basement.  The proprietor wishes to dispose of it.\n\n11th January 1919 letter, Miss A C Hare to the Museum\nexplaining that the ceiling is no longer intact; only the medallions remain.  There is no wood in them; they are all plaster.\n\n17th January 1919, Oliver Brackett minute paper\nBrackett inspected one of the 8 medallions which had a head and inscription.  The others were in store and might possibly bear a date.  He reports that there were no photos taken before demolition of the ceiling but the proprietor (Mr Long) remembers it in position and could explain the arrangement.  Long told Brackett that the ceiling was described in Taylor's \"Putney Past & Present\" (1910?), a guide published by estate agents.  Brackett  attempted to locate a copy of Taylor's but it was out of print.\n\n7th February 1919, Cecil Smith minute paper\ndescribes the medallions as bearing the Royal Arms, the date 1596, the Tudor Rose and other heraldic devices.  \"They have a considerable amount of interest and would be acceptable for the Museum\".",
