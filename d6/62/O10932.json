By this date, milk or cream jugs had become an essential part of the tea service.\n\nDesign\nJugs in the form of standing cows were made in London in some quantity during the second half of the 18th century. Most bear the mark of John Schuppe, and were made between 1753 and 1773. His name indicates that he may have come from The Netherlands, where cow creamers made in ceramic were already fashionable.  All these creamers follow the same basic form, with a looped tail and a saddle-shaped lid with a finial in the form of a fly. Both silver and silver-gilt versions are known, and variations occur on the type and amount of hair on the body and head.\n\nPopularity\nThe large numbers of cow creamers that survive attest to their enduring popularity. Such was their renown that they merited inclusion in 20th-century literature: Bertie Wooster, the hero of tales by the author P.G. Wodehouse, found these cow creamers quite disgusting.",
