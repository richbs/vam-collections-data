The second shows four smaller sapphires in the centre - two oval, and one teardrop-shaped - inlaid above and below which are five small diamonds on each side. The third design depicts a slightly twisted gold band, in which the two ends do not meet, but overlap, and hold between them five small sapphires and eight smaller diamonds. The three alternative centrepieces each show a variation of a large diamond within a blue enamel frame.",

Designs like these demonstrate the diversity of the jewellery produced by the  Brogden firm. \n\nThe firm was founded by John Brogden the elder in about  1796. From about 1824 to 1831 it was styled 'Brogden and  Garland' and thereafter until 1841 'Garland and Watherston'.  The younger Brogden, the son of Thomas Brogden and  presumably a relative of the founder, served an apprenticeship  to J.W. garland as a goldsmith and jeweller from 1834 to 1841.  Following Garland's departure, the remaining partner, J.H.  Watherston,  removed the firm to new premises at 16  Henrietta Street, Covent Garden and in 1848 joined forces  with the younger Brogden.",
