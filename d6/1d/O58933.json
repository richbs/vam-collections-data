Pierre Erard (1794-1855) ran the London operation from 1814 and took over the entire firm after the death of his uncle Sebastien in 1831. In 1833 Pierre started making harps in the Gothic style, which by then was highly fashionable. This harp is fitted with a double action: by pushing a pedal into one of two notches, the player could raise each string either a semi-tone or whole tone. From the mid 1830s, the London branch of the firm increasingly specialized in harps and the Paris branch in pianos.",
