The basic shape of the body was usually that of a flattened sphere. The rim, the spouts and the junctions of the loop handle with the body were opportunities for the craftsman to demonstrate his artistic skills. It is not uncommon to find a human bust concealing the join. \n\nOccasionally lavabos were made with a single spout. This example is of the more common type, with two spouts placed between the supports for the handle, although one of the spouts is missing. The end of the surviving spout is shaped like the head and open jaws of some fabulous creature \u2013 a design motif that was common also in ewers. The source of this motif remains obscure but it remained popular for a long time and was still being used to embellish teapots and coffee pots until the late 18th century.",
