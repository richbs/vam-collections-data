A man, wearing a doublet, bends towards the fire holding a spade or pitchfork. Above him stands a woman, wearing a horned headdress and a girded gown, also apparently pouring water onto the fire. A man, wearing a low-belted doublet, stands at the top right of the panel, holding his right hand to his head and with his left hand holding something over his shoulder. \n\nThe top left corner of the panel has been restored in plaster. The panel is cracked right across in the middle. The left hand of the small figure near the fire is misisng, as well as the shaft of the spade or pitchfork which he holds. The left arm of the figure in the top right of the panel is missing. \n\nGreen paint, looking very 'scrubbed,' remains on the usual daisy-patterned ground. The paint on the upper background looks modern. The top left corner of the panel has been backed with slate. There are two lead-plugged holes, one with a latten wire attached. The bottom has been cut away.",
