Much of its success came from its distinctive line of \u2018Reflection\u2019 jewellery. The \u2018Reflection\u2019 line was the first to introduce the bold shapes and colours of modern European jewellery to America. \n\nThe jewels were made using the technique of casting, which allowed the firm to create pieces by experimenting with a range of standardised parts. Under the tag line \u2018Reflection \u2013 Your Personality in a Jewel\u2019 women were encouraged to decide on the arrangement of the parts themselves and create personalised jewellery at a lower cost than was possible with conventional bespoke jewels. The use of dramatic, semi-precious stones also increased their affordability.  \n\nThe style of \u2018Reflection\u2019 jewellery was modified over time, and by the late 1930s and early 1940s it was characterised by the smooth curves evident in this piece.",
