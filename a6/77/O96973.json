There are brazed to a central strip and are stamped underneath with a version of the St. Etienne mark, consisting of crossed palms surmounted by the letter A. The vents are gold lined and the barrel has a false breech. The walnut half-stock is carved with foliage and flowers around the fore-end and the tang of the barrel. A lion's mask is carved at the bottom of the grip. Felt cheek pad covered with velvet (restored), silver mounts engraved with foliage and animals. The trigger guard and fore end are cast and chased with lion's masks in relief. In front of the trigger guard an oval silver escutcheon engraved with the crest of Thellusson, probably for John Thellusson, second Baron Rendlesham (1785-1832). The locks are blued and engraved. They are signed 'Aubrun \u00e0 Nantes' and have been fitted in England with gravitating stops, a device patented by Joseph Manton in June 1812. Aubron is not recorded as a gunmaker and it is probable that he was merely the retailer of a gun made at St. Etienne.",
