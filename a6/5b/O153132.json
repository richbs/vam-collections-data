            "history_note": "Bequeathed by Harold A. Peto of Iford Manor, Bradford-on-Avon, Wilts (an architect and garden designer, whose collection of furniture consisted 'entirely of oak').  H. Clifford Smith, in a minute note (2/8/33) wrote that it 'differs substantially from any other example already in the Museum'. No other information regarding its provenance is recorded on the acquisition papers.\n\n\u2018Mr. Harold Peto\u2019s Collection\u2019 by \u2018M.J.\u2019 in Country Life, April 10th, 1926 (vol. LIX), \n\nIford Manor, Wiltshire, the property of Mr H.A. Peto \u2013 I and II, in Country Life, Aug. 26th 1922, pp.242-8, and Sept. 2nd 1922, pp.272-7\n\n\nDesign\nThe regional origin of this chair is not certain. The location of the chair in a Wiltshire collection need not signify its earlier history. What may be said is that while rush seated chairs with backs that combine spindles and mid-rails were widely found from about 1800, the form was found with particular frequency, made in ash, in NW England (Cheshire and Lancashire). See Bernard D. Cotton, The English Regional Chair (Woodbridge, 1990), p.310 ff. Cotton also notes (p.314, fig. NW7) the strong possibility of design transmission between NW England and America.\n\nThe distinctive slat armrests, probably made using a draw-knife, are also seen on a few surviving 17th century American turned, rush-seated chairs. See for example Benno M. Forman, American Seating Furniture 1630-1730 (New York and London, 1988), fig. 44",
