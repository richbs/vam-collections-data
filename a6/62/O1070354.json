Full citation: \n\n\u201c<b>Unknown Woman </b>\n<b>1668</b>\nEvans 44\n\n<b>Oval 44 x 35 mm\n</b>\nFeatures hatched and stippled in brown, with grey, blue and red modelling; hair similarly worked in pale brown, lined with gummy darker colour and with pale gouache lights; on a smooth, peach-coloured carnation ground; dress in very pale brown and grey washes with thick white, modelled and shadowed with darker colour; landscape and sky washed and stippled in greens, blues and yellow; background to the left a solid grey wash; on vellum put down on a leaf from a table-book. \n\n<b>Condition:</b> Some flaking, especially in the white impasto of the dress; otherwise fine. \n\n<b>Signed:</b> Lower centre left, with the brush point in black: <i>PC</i>; and on the back, underlined with a flourish: <i>PC. Fecit. / Anno. Domini. 1668.\n</i>\n<b>Frame:</b> Seventeenth-century oval gold locket, the convex back enamelled all over in opaque pale blue, and the sides with an openwork border of enamelled acanthus sprays repeated twelve times (one section missing); the sides have a right -angled rebate to take an enamelled front cover (now missing) and turn into a bezel, which holds the shallowly convex glass by its bevelled edge; the hanger of D-section, enamelled on the outside in pale blue; at the bottom, a small loop for suspending a pearl. \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> Acquired by the Hon. F H A Wallop from an unrecorded source and lent to the Museum, 1927-49; the ownership transferred to Alan Evans in 1933, and by him bequeathed to the National Gallery, 1974; placed on indeterminate loan at the V&A. (See Appendix 3.) \n\n<b>Exhibited:</b> Grosvenor Place 1932; New Haven etc. 1981-2, no. 59. \n\n<b>Literature:</b> Long 1929, p. 60 (as by Carandini or Cleyn; group 2 'with conjoined initials', item k); <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 13; Murdoch 1981, p. 158, col. pl. 24c. \n\nWallop attributed this miniature to Penelope Cleyn, one of the two artists to whom connoisseurs had since around 1900 given the unidentified initials <i>PC</i>. Long took most of the crucial steps towards solving this problem in 1935 when he acquired <i>William Gore</i> (Cat. No. 166) for the Museum. This enabled him to correct Wallop's attribution of the present miniature and he wrote firmly in the Wallop Loan Book that it was by Cross; he did not however dissent from Wallop's dating of it to <i>c.</i>1660. \n\nThe locket was opened for the first time in March 1976 and the full signature and date on the back were discovered. As a work of 1668, the miniature follows on from the <i>Robert Kerr</i> (Cat. No. 164), which is Signed and dated 1667. Like the <i>Unknown Woman</i>.in the Buccleuch Collection, it is an unexpected and apparently regressive work, in format looking back to the small enamel-influenced miniatures of the 1650s, rather than to the enlarged ovals and sophisticated chiaroscuro which Cooper had developed for the Restoration Court. The sitter in fact hardly looks English; the locket which would also be regressive in England at this date, is likely to be Netherlandish: perhaps Cross was adapting his style for a client whose taste differed from that prevailing in English Court circles, or was Simply copying an earlier portrait.\" ",
