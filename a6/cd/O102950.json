It was a less expensive method of casting suited to the multiple production of simple objects such as plaquettes and bells. In the 19th century, however, a more sophisticated technique was developed for the serial production of sculptural bronzes. Some artists rebelled against this, favouring instead the traditional method of lost-wax casting. This plaquette was sand cast. The raised lines on the back show where the sprues were placed so that the molten metal could flow through the mould. The metal has not quite reached every part, leaving holes or \u2018casting flaws\u2019 in the bronze. This plaquette could possibly have been part of a casket.",
