The body is white tinplate with the lid hinged at the top back. The name is attached at the front and there is also a red plastic switch and dial marked OFF and ON. The lid has at the back a red metal disc and a blue, white and red square panel; these represent the temperature and control panels. The centre of the lid has been replace with a sheet of clear green plastic. When the lid is lifted, there is the washing area of blue metal with a wringer of red plastic; on the left side is a small white hole which leads to a green rubber pipe outside.  This pipe is held in an upright position by a metal loop. Water can be placed in the washer and agitated by the wringer.  When done with the water will drain away via the hole and pipe. The underside is black metal and the whole stands on 4 red rubber feet. The hole for the clockwork key is on the right side and the switch on the front operates the on/off mechanism.",
