Although it is very attractive it would probably be uncomfortable to hold, so it was more likely to have been a display piece than a drinking vessel.\n\nThe use of jade cups in China was a complex matter. Daoist adepts believed jade had a preserving effect on the human body. Eating and drinking vessels made of jade were also symbols of affluence and privilege for those who could afford them. During the last few centuries of the Imperial era, jade cups were simply displayed as expensive decorative items.",

All share the characteristics of having a gap in the otherwise encircling openwork carving to allow drinking when the cup is held in two hands, a common shade of jade, and a very sharp edged carving, with little sign of finishing.  Cups of this type seen on display in the Palace Museum, Beijing in April 1986, there dated 'mid-Ming (1436-1566)'.",
