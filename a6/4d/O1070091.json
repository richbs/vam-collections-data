All three miniatures were bequeathed to the museum by Mr. Charles Steuart Betton.\n\nHistorical significance: The dates given on the dpartment file for Mary Steuart are; b.1767, d. 1810.  The implication also is that she married in 1795, but there is no entry on the file from the testator for this miniature similar to that on the department files for John and Elizabeth (see. P.19 and 20-1937).  It seems likely that she was another daughter of Hew Steuart, and was also born in India (Diana Hill, the miniaturist, worked in India, but the miniature is not signed and this is an attribution only).",
