In the late 1960s they created psychedelic posters for many of the English bands of the time, and decorated and advertised Nigel Waymouth's King's Road boutique, Granny Takes a Trip. They also designed for concerts held at UFO club and Saville Theatre, and for underground magazine Oz. Their influences came from the decorative and eroticised designs of Art Nouveau, combined with the melting rainbow colours of LSD visions and pop art inspirations from the post-war media; traces of Disney, horror movie monsters and comic book characters and can often be seen  hiding amongst the images.\n\nMiddle Earth was an underground club that followed on from UFO, and was run in the same tradition, featuring performances by bands, music and visuals. Regular bands included Soft Machine, Tomorrow and Tyrannosaurus Rex (Marc Bolan's earlier Hippie incarnation of T. Rex), and other bands who performed include Pink Floyd, The Who, Fairport Convention, Donovan and, as advertised on the poster, Tim Buckley.",
