Gebr\u00fcder Bing of Nuremberg; 1866-1919 succeeded by BINGWERKE 1920- 1933. The constructional kits were registered in 1913 and this one could be as early as 1913 or as late as 1923 with the new Bingwerke mark of a BW was registered though it had been in use from 1920. The defination of the coils and wheels in the circles of the diamond mark indicate 1904 rather than 1906 when the English mark with simple burst\nshapes in each was registered. This kit was not designed for the English market. \n*See Gwen White; Toys Dolls and Automata; Encyclopedia of Dolls; Directory\nof German Dolls; Anthony Gross Collection details; A Noschka & G Knerr; Bauklotze Staunen",
