The variety of styles and colours must have offered some relief from the dark tones then fashionable for men's suits. In March 1895 the Tailor and Cutter referred to ties and scarves as being the 'saving touch from the monotony of sombreness ... Bows, scarves and ties seem to get more and more varied, and, in the majority of styles prettier and more artistic.'\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe high collars fashionable in the late 19th century often made it difficult to keep the neckband of the tie in place.  The invention of tie clips and frames helped to solve this problem. \n\nTime\nDuring second half of the 19th century four distinct styles of necktie evolved. They were given a great many different names, which can be confusing. The main categories were:  (i) bow tie; (ii) scarf or neckerchief;  (iii) Ascot; and (iv) four-in-hand, or sailor's knot, generally referred to as the 'long tie'.",
