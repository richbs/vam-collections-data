He wears a cloak draped over his right arm over a camel-skin, the hoof of which trails on the ground, leaving his legs bare. He stands on the left of the panel, holding a closed book in his left hand and pointing with his right hand towards the figure of Herod Antipas. The bearded Herod, wearing a crown surmounted by a devil's cap and a low-belted doublet and hose, is seated cross-legged on a draped and canopied throne, his left leg hanging down and resting on a tasselled cushion. He holds a falchion in his left hand, which rests on his shoulder; his right hand is raised. The figure of Herodias, wearing a horned headdress, a necklace with a rose pendant, and a belted V-necked gown over a robe, stands between Herod and the saint in the middle of the panel. She holds the revers of her gown and her left foot rests on the cushion. A beardless figure wearing a short belted gown stands looking up on the left of the panel, holding a staff in his right hand. Four other figures stand at the back of the panel, one on the left holding a falchion in his right hand and one on the right wearing a hat with a bag-shaped crown and a rolled brim. \n\nThe servant's staff on the left of the panel is broken off. The bottom edge of the panel has been chipped in the middle and repaired. Green paint and the usual daisy pattern remain on the ground at the bottom of the panel. Gilding is on the hair and beard of the Baptist and on his camel-skin. The edges of the robes of the other figures are gilded. The upper background is gilt with traces of gesso knobs. There are traces of red on Herod's shoes and on the folds of his and the Baptist's garments. The faces and hands of all the figures save the Baptist and Herodias are darkened.\n\nThe back of the panel is marked. There are three lead-plugged holes. There is a ridge from the top of the panel to the bottom indicating where two saw cuts have met.",

After executing his first wife, Herod had married his brother\u2019s wife, Herodias. The busy, crowded composition and earnest expressions of the figures are typical of late 15thcentury alabaster panels.\n\nThere are two sorts of alabaster. Calcite alabaster is very hard and was used in ancient times. This object is made of gypsum alabaster which is a fine-grained, soft and smooth stone. Although at first glance it looks a little like marble, which it was intended to imitate, it was much easier to carve due to its softness, and alabaster objects were therefore significantly cheaper to produce. Marble does not originate in England, so it was imported if needed, whereas in the 15th century there were important alabaster quarries in Nottingham, York, Burton-on-Trent and London. England was a major centre for the production of objects such as this one. During period, they were exported in very large numbers to Europe where they survive, unlike many examples which remained in England and were destroyed or greatly damaged during the Reformation.",
