            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of British Oil Paintings 1820-1860</i>, Ronald Parkinson, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1990, p. 154\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"LEAR, Edward (1812-1888) \n\nBorn Highgate, London, 12 May 1812. His career has three distinct aspects: ornithological illustration, landscape painting and writing (especially in the near and middle East), and the nonsense writings and drawings for children that brought him fame. Draughtsman at the Zoological Gardens 1831, publishing 'Illustrations of the Family of the Psittacidae' (1832); later assisted John Gould with illustrations for 'Birds of Europe' and other publications. Published his most famous work The Book of Nonsense (1846). Exhibited 19 works at the RA between 1850 and 1873, five at the BI 1852-63, and four, including two watercolours, at the SBA 1836-55. A prolific artist in pencil and watercolour (there are examples also in the V&A collections), his oil paintings seem to date mainly from the 1850s. Gave drawing lessons to Queen Victoria, and travelled extensively. Died San Remo, Italy, 29 January 1888. \nLIT: \tP Hofer Edward Lear as a Landscape Draughtsman 1967; V Noakes Edward Lear: the Life of a Wanderer 1968; V Noakes Edward Lear RA exhibition catalogue 1985 (With full bibliography); E Lear, ed \nP Sherrard, The Corfu Years 1988\n\nCorfu \nP19-1946 Neg E953 \nPaper, 24.7 X 34.8 cm (8\u00bd \u00d7 11\u00bd  ins) \nGiven by Howard Bliss (through the National Art Collections Fund) \nA letter from the artist 19 February 1856 (published in Lady Strachey Letters of Edward Lear ... 1907, pp32-5; quoted in L Durrell Lear's Corfu 1965, p9) records 'I still think of making Corfu my head-quarters, and of painting a large picture here of the Ascension festa in June, for 1857 Exhibition ... ' Corfu was one of Lear's favourite places and inspired several of his finest works; he stayed there regularly from at least 1855 to 1863. Lear wrote in a letter 8 June 1863 'The farther I go from Corfu - the more I look back to the delight its beautiful quiet has so long given me, and I am by no means approaching the filth and horror and noise of London life with a becoming spirit'. \nThe view in the present work is from above the village of Ascension, looking down to the twin-peaked citadel on the peninsular on the east coast of the island, across the Ionian sea to the distant mountains of Albania. The view may be compared with those lithographed as plates 1 and 3 in Lear's 'Views in the Seven Ionian Islands .. .' (1863), and with the undated oil now in a private collection (repr V Noakes Edward Lear 1968, pp136-7).  P Hofer (Edward Lear as a Landscape Draughtsman 1968, pp49-50) refers to Lear's 1877 list of paintings and notes 11 of this view of Corfu; he reproduces, an oil of about 1858 in upright format, two pencil drawings, and a finished watercolour of 1862 (plates 107, 108a and b, 61). A watercolour of a similar view, signed and dated 1856, was exhibited by Spink in 1988; the catalogue quotes a letter of 24 February 1856: \nYesterday afternoon I walked to find a place called Viro, whence I hear that there were good views of Corfu; & I really think I saw the loveliest of anything one has yet discovered. You see the whole coast and channel, the Citadel, town & lake - immediately above a thick wood of orange trees: - I never saw anything more exquisite, with the millions of oranges glittering in the sun. Won't I paint a large picture from there some day. \nThe 'large picture' was intended for the 1857 RA exhibition, and was completed and sold in early August 1857. \n\nRonald Parkinson\"\n<u>Victoria &amp; Albert Museum Department of Engraving Illustration and Design &amp; Department of Paintings, Accessions 1946</u>.
