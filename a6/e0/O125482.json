            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, pp. 152, 153, 154\nThe following is an extract from the text of the entry:\n\nThe view on the <i>recto</i> shows Branch Hill Pond from much the same viewpoint as in No. 171 [122-1888].\n\nHolmes, p. 248, dates c.1827.  Mayne (L. ed. M., p. 413) dates c. 1822.  The cloud study No. 251a [339-1888 back] justifies a dates c. 1822, and the style of the sketch on the <i>recto</i> is consistent with the vies of Hampstead made in 1821 and 1822.\n\n\nNote on Nos. 248, 250, and 251A [590-1888, 784-1888, 339-1888 (back)]\n\nIn his letter of 7 October 1822 to Fisher, Constable says (L. ed. S., p. 131) \u201cI have made about fifty carefull studies of <i>skies</i>, tolerably large to be carefull\u201d.  In his comment on this letter Leslie remarks: \u201cTwenty of Constable\u2019s studies of skies made during this season are in my possession, and there is but one among them in which a vestige of landscape is introduced.  They are painted in oil, on large sheets of thick paper, and all dated, with the time of day, the direction of the wind, and other memoranda on their backs.  On one, for instance, is written \u20185th of September, 1822.  10 o\u2019clock, morning, looking south-east, brisk wind at west.  Very bright and fresh grey clouds running over a yellow bed, about half way in the sky.  Very appropriate to the \u201ccoast at Osmington\u201d\u2019\u201d.  The sketch thus described by Leslie is now in the National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne, having been purchased from the collection of Sir Michael Sadler by the Felton Bequest in 1938; it measures 18 x 12 ins. \nNo. 249 [590-1888] is the only dated oil sketch in the Museum from the series described by Leslie, but Nos. 250 [784-1888] and 251a [339-1888 back], although smaller, may perhaps be assigned to the same period.  The absence of landscape mentioned by Leslie serves to differentiate the pure cloud studies of 1822 from the sky and tree studies of 1821 (see note following No. 235 [786-1888]).  Cloud studies dated 28 July, 31 August, 6 September and 21 September 1822 were in the collection of the late Sir Farquhar Buzzard.  The last-named of these was sold at Messrs. Sotheby\u2019s, 26 July 1961 (Lot 160).  It measured 11 \u00bc x 19 ins. and was inscribed on the back <i>Sept. 21. 1822. \u00bd past one o\u2019clock Looking South.  Wind very fresh at East, but warm.</i>  Another, dated 1 August 1822, is in the collection of Gilbert Davis (reproduced by Badt, Pl. 5).  Nos. 313 and 238 at the Grosvenor Gallery Winter Exhibition, 1889, were cloud studies, dated 6 September and 28 September 1822 respectively; the latter measured 9 x 11 ins. and had a description of the weather on the back.  Both these sketches were lent by the executors of Miss Isabel Constable.",
