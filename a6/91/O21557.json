W. Harry Rogers drew on wood for this engraving to be made by a wood-engraver.\n\nVisible on the reverse is a sharp, horizontal crease through the centre of the sheet of paper crossed in two places by two, vertical creases.  These creases may have been used to line this illustration up with the border it decorates.\n\n'Emblem I'  'I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin.' - ROM.
