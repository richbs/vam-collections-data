These designs for a scent bottle were drawn possibly by the goldsmith Jean Ducrollay (born in 1710 and died in 1787) in about 1760. Ducrollay became a master in 1734. They are from an album of designs which date from about 1735-1820 and includes those for snuffboxes, scent holders, watches and watch cases, spoons, fans and fan mounts, small swords, and chatelaines (ornamental chains, pins, or clasps usually worn at a woman's waist, to which trinkets, keys, purses, or other articles are attached). \n\nThere is a close relationship between the contents of the album and known work by three Parisian goldsmiths, Ducrollay, Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Drais (active 1761-1788), and Charles Ouizille (1744-1830) whose names appear on the first page of the album. This suggests that all the designs emanate from their workshops.  Drais worked for the Court at Versailles as jeweller to both King Louis XV and Louis XVI. Ouizille worked in this capacity for Louis XVI. Most of the material dates from the period 1755-90.\n\n\n\nScent bottles were breathtakingly expensive.  Lazare Duvaux, the marchand-bijoutier, or jeweller, to Louis XV noted the scent bottles that he sold on a daily basis and to which client.  He sold Louis XV 'four crystal bottles with different perfumes, 266L'. They therefore cost 266 livres over half the entire wealth of a lower class family whose money totalled 500 livres.",
