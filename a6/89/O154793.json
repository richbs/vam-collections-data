            "public_access_description": "Georg Nees (born 1926, Nuremberg) is considered one of the founders of computer art and graphics.  He was also one of the first people to exhibit his computer graphics, at the studio gallery of the Technische Hochschule in Stuttgart in February 1965.\n\nNees studied mathematics and physics at the universities of Erlangen-Nuremberg and Stuttgart.   He subsequently worked for Siemens as a software engineer, and was instrumental in their purchasing a 'Zuse Graphomat', a drawing machine operated by computer-generated punched tape.  The machine was capable of creating geometric patterns and, although the programming language that Nees used (ALGOL) was designed specifically for scientific computers, he used it to create aesthetic images. In 1969 he received his doctorate on the subject of Generative Computer Graphics, under Max Bense, the German philosopher and writer.\n\nThese prints are three photographs of a single plotter drawing by Nees, reproduced in orange and green. The original drawing was created in 1965 and was called Achsenparalleler irrweg (2), or Axis-parallel maze. \n\nA number of Nees's early computer drawings were included in Cybernetic Serendipity, an exhibition held at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in 1968. In the book published to accompany the exhibition, he explains how the original drawing was made:\n\n\"Axis-parallel maze\nBeginning at one corner of the rectangular frame, draw a straight edge line within the frame. The line should consist of 4,000 sections of random length, each one under 15 millimetres long, alternating horizontal and vertical lines - the horizontal lines either to left or right at random, the vertical lines up or down. The programme produces a continuous shape or form.\" (p.79)\n\nThese photographic reproductions of Nees's plotter drawing were donated to the V&amp;A by the Computer Arts Society, which organised a number of exhibitions in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The V&amp;A also holds another two prints of the same image, also mounted on a single board.",
