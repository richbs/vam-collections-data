Although it represents a  standard seventeenth-century form, the contemporary  inscription round the rim identifies it as a 'Bath gift' (or, in  German, 'Badgeschenk'), a type of gift associated with the  health-giving thermal baths of Switzerland. By the seventeenth  century, town councils were careful to honour important visitors  to their thermal baths with a valuable gift, such as an inscribed  silver or silver-gilt cup. The scene engraved in the bowl of the cup depicts a feast described in the Old Testament (Genesis 43.34). Joseph invites his brothers, who are estranged from him, to a lavish feast at his house. It is an appropriate subject to decorate a cup intended as a gift to honour a governor of Zurich, the identity of whom is unknown today.",

            "history_note": "This gilded silver cup is a rare survival. Although it represents a standard seventeenth-century form, the contemporary inscription round the rim identifies it as a 'Bath gift' (or, in German, 'Badgeschenk'), a type of gift associated with the health-giving thermal baths of Switzerland. By the seventeenth century, town councils were careful to honour important visitors to their thermal baths with a valuable gift, such as an inscribed silver or silver-gilt cup. Sixteenth-century depictions of these baths show naked men and women seated in open-air baths around a floating table; the most important among them are offered wine in a shallow, footed cup similar to this one (Preiswerk-L\u00f6sel: 1991, plate 93, p. 114). The cup now in the V&amp;A was presented to an un-named governor of Zurich. It is a particularly striking gift, as in theory the puritan religious strictures of Zurich town council prohibited such expenditure (L\u00f6sel: 1983, p. 70).\nHans Rudolf Boller, who made the cup, was born in 1625, the son of a Regensburg minister. He was apprenticed to the Zurich goldsmith Melchior Tr\u00fcb between 1639-43 (L\u00f6sel: 1983, p. 162). Little of his work survives. There is a spoon bearing his mark in the V&amp;A (449-1873), and his other three works are all cups, two of these in the form of heraldic beasts (a lion and a lynx).\nThe scene engraved in the bowl of the cup depicts a feast described in the Old  Testament (Genesis 43.34) and derives from illustrations by the engraver Matth\u00e4us Merians for an illustrated Bible of 1625. The skilled execution of the engraving on the cup suggests this was the work of a professional engraver (L\u00f6sel: 1983, p. 72).\nThe Museum purchased the cup from Messrs Goldschmidt, Frankfurt, in 1872.",
