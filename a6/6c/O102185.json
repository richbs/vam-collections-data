Though the cartoon style was light-hearted and comical, it was also designed as bitter provocation, baiting the sometimes brutal forces of law enforcement and imperialism.\nThe following quote is extracted from an interview with Douglas that featured in the book 'This Side of Glory' by David Hilliard and Lewis Cole (Boston: Little & Brown, 1993. page 151):\n\"...One day Huey [Newton, founder of the Black Panther Party] got an idea about the police. We had started calling the police swine because of the nature of their character - they had the most beastly character; dirty and filthy, abusing people and what have you. So Huey gets a picture of a pig and says he wants to put that in the paper - just on the front page - and put the badge of this policeman, who was in Oakland and who had been murdering and harassing people in the community. But from my learning in art school I saw a way of carrying things a step further, improving on it. I said, 'My man, why don't we dress them up, like humans, and stand them up?'\n\"And that's what I did. We put the cops on their feet and showed them running--bullets coming at them and them running. I think that captivated the attention....\"",
