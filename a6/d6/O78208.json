Once the lines on the plate have been filled with ink, the plate is then pressed onto successive sheets of paper, each time transferring the image.\n\nTrading\nPublishers of sets of prints in the 18th century often financed them by taking in subscriptions in advance and then issuing the set in parts. Thomas Johnson (born 1714; died after 1778) began publishing the set of prints which this dedication eventually accompanied in 1756. Subscribers paid 1s 6d per part, plus a cover charge of another 1s 6d. There were 13 parts, with each part made up of four pages. The total cost to subscribers was therefore 21s (i.e., \u00a31 1s, or 1 guinea). Alternatively, anyone who had not subscribed could pay the higher price of 25s when all the parts came out in book form in 1758. In 1761 the set was re-issued with one additional plate, and this was the first time it was given the title One Hundred and Fifty New Designs.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe subjects of the plates which followed this dedication included mirror and picture frames, candlestands and candlesticks, clockcases, brackets, ewers and vases, in a variety of styles including Chinese, Gothick and Rural. At least one design for a ewer owed its origins to a French metalwork design previously published in Paris in 1748.",
