The plain side would have been used for eating delicacies such as marzipan or sugar plums, before being turned over to reveal the paintings and poems. Rather like Christmas crackers today, each carries a verse to be read out and enjoyed by guests.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nEach roundel shows a character such as a soldier or a richly dressed lady, with a satirical verse about their habits. The verses, entitled The Twelve Wonders of the World, were written by John Davies, especially for trenchers at a New Year party given around 1600 by Thomas Sackville, Ist Earl of Dorset. They were published in 1608 and were then available for other trencher makers to copy. This set was probably made around 1620.  Other sets show flowers, biblical texts and proverbs.\n\nOwnership & Use\nOnly wealthy people could afford to use such luxury objects.  The fact that they have survived means that they were carefully looked after through the generations.  Surviving sets such as this one show no sign of use. The initials 'E.W.' on the box could be those of the owner or the maker.",
