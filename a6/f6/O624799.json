But it has been suggested that they could perhaps be by Pierre Milan, since it is quite unusual for Boyvin not to sign his work. Depictions of the Greek and Roman divinities were quite common in the 16th century, as were grotesques. But to represent the Roman gods surrounded by grotesques, and with such details, makes this set a very original one.\n\nThe original drawings were made by L\u00e9onard Thiry in the middle of the sixteenth century, as the inscription on the first plate \u2018Leonardus Theodoricus inventor\u2019 demonstrates. They were once attributed to Rosso Fiorentino and his influence is quite strong in this set. Indeed Rosso himself drew a series of Gods in Niches engraved by Caraglio. In both series, gods and goddesses are set up in traditional pairs, such as Pluto and Proserpina, Ariadne and Bacchus; furthermore Thiry\u2019s compositions are often extremely reminiscent of Rosso\u2019s. For example, Saturn is shown in the same posture, devouring one of his children, in both sets. \n\nThe four prints showing Neptune, Thetis, Hercules and Hebe are very rare, and unlike the others, they are unnumbered.",

But Henri Zerner (L\u2019Ecole de Fontainebleau, 1972, p. 332, no.434) suggested that they could perhaps be by Pierre Milan, since it is quite unusual for Boyvin not to sign his work. Depictions of the Greek and Roman divinities were quite common in the 16th century, as were grotesques. But to represent the Roman gods surrounded by grotesques, and with such details, makes this set a very original one.\n\nThe original drawings were made by L\u00e9onard Thiry in the middle of the sixteenth century, as the inscription on the first plate \u2018Leonardus Theodoricus inventor\u2019 demonstrates. An old attribution to Rosso exists due to the fact that the name of L\u00e9onard Thiry was scratched and replaced with the inscription \u2018maitre Rous\u2019 by a fraudulent publisher. Nevertheless, Rosso\u2019s influence is quite strong in this set. Indeed Rosso himself drew a series of Gods in Niches engraved by Caraglio (Bartsch illustrated, 28, pp. 116-165). In both series, gods and goddesses are set up in traditional pairs, such as Pluto and Proserpina, Ariadne and Bacchus; furthermore Thiry\u2019s compositions are often extremely reminiscent of Rosso\u2019s. For example, Saturn is shown in the same posture, devouring one of his children, in both sets. \n\nThe four prints showing Neptune, Thetis, Hercules and Hebe are very rare, and unlike the others, they are unnumbered.",
