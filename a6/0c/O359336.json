            "public_access_description": "The parasol was a popular accessory during the 19th and early 20th century, a period when sun tanned skin was highly undesirable. It functioned both as a sunshade and a fashionable accompaniment to dress, distinguishing itself from the umbrella through its infinite and luxurious forms and essentially feminine status. Like the earlier trend for fans parasols displayed an individual's style and could be used in a coquettish ritual to hide the modest bearer from unwanted glances.\n\nSmall parasols such as this example were designed for open carriage rides which were hugely popular leading up to the middle of the nineteenth century. A folding hinge, held upright by a sliding metal tube when open, meant the parasol could be reduced to half its size when not in use. Carriage parasols were often elaborate in design as their small size meant manufacturers could display their very best in labour and materials. They were also key in the display of wealth and taste, the very possession of one implying ownership of a carriage. The ornate silk covering of this example is of a complex reversible weave which displays the intricate floral designs both inside and out.",
