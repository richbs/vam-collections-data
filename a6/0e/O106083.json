Her wide, low-necked pale brown bodice has a large bow over her breasts and a white sleeve frill; around her arm is a black frilled shawl, which flies out over the back of her long brown tiered skirt.  Under the skirt can be seen her white, broiderie anglaise-trimmed underskirt.  Opposite her is a male figure, his right arm raised, and left held down, standing on his left toe, with right leg kicked out behind.  He has handsome side-whiskers, and wears dull brown trousers, a tall top hat, black tail coat, white cravat, shirt and shawl-collared double-breasted waistcoat.  On the floor is a small bouquet.",

It was there that Princesse Celeste de Mogador danced the Can-Can eccentrique, which became the rage of the public dance halls with people from all walks of life.  The high kick performed by the woman is a feature of the dance, although her kick is not excessively high and she seems to be trying to hold her skirt down for decency's sake. By 1848 the police felt that the Can-Can was becoming too risqu\u00e9, but by the end of the century it was a symbol of Paris, performed with great abandon, bare thigh glimpsed amid frou-frou and lace, high kicks that could take off a gentleman's top hat, concluding with the essential splits.",
