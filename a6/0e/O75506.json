Heeding the protests of SCAPA (The Society for Checking the Abuses of Public Advertising) against poster hoardings and obtrusive signs along the roadside, Shell began to attach posters to the sides and backs of lorries. Jack Beddington, publicity director of the amalgamated Shell-Mex and BP Ltd, commissioned well-known artists as well as specialist poster artists to produce these lorry bills. These were changed every few weeks, so many artists were involved. Beddington\u2019s use of artists and emphasis on landscape imagery did not simply reflect his personal artistic preference. It was carefully targeted to appeal to his middle-class customers. These not only appreciated art, but were being rallied by action groups, such as the Council for the Preservation of Rural England.",
