Under Ercole Ferrara experienced a significant enlargement that trebled the area within the city walls. This is known after is patron as the Herculean Addition.  Ercole was a generous patron of the arts and especially vocal music. He also assembled a great library amongst other achievements.\n\nJohn Pope-Hennessy states that the relief is copied from a medal by Baldassare d'Este (d.1504).  Pope-Hennessy also remarked, with regard to this marble relief, that 'the carving is of poor quality'.  Pope-Hennessy was unsure whether the relief was a contemporary variant of the Baldassare d'Este medal mentioned previously, or a relief made after Duke Ercole's death as part of a series of Este portraits.",
