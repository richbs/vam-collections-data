The following is the full text of the entry: <i>Copies after </i> PRIMATICCIO, FRANCESCO (1504-70) 257 Part of a frieze, with a panel containing a picture of Venus pointing out Psyche to Cupid Pen and ink and wash, heightened with gold, on brown tinted paper 11 1/8 x 16 5/8 (283 x 422) 8077 PROVENANCE (?)Ploos van Amstel; William Mayor (Lugt 2799) LITERATURE <i>A brief chronological description of a collection of original drawings and sketches... formed by and belonging to Mr Mayor</i>, </u></i>1871, no. 46 The Mayor catalogue, cited here, states that the drawing was formerly in the collection of Ploos van Amstel and attributes it to Giulio Clovio, under whose name it was catalogued in the Museum till lately. But is in fact a version, hitherto unpublished, of a design that has been much discussed in print. There are two other versions in the Louvre: (a) inv. No. 3497. Hartt, I, pp. 88-9; p. 295, no. 139; pl. 49: W. McAllister Johnson, \u2018Les d\u00e9buts de Primatice \u00e0 Fontainebleau\u2019 in <i>Revue de l\u2019Art</i>, no. 6, 1969, pp. 9-18; pl. 2; Exhibition Catalogue, <i>L\u2019Ecole de Fontainebleau</i>, Grand Palais, Paris, 1972, no. 143. Hartt endorses the old attribution to Giulio Romano and suggests it was a design for the decoration in the Stalle del Te at Mantua, of which nothing survives. McAllister Johnson, on the other hand, maintains that the drawing is by Primaticcio and a design for the no longer extant Chambre du Roi in the palace of Fontainebleau. The drawing is bigger than ours in so far as it shows on the right another scene from the story of Psyche. (b) inv.no. 3677; McAllsiter Johnson, pl. 4; exhibition catalogue cited no. 266. Ascribed to Primaticcio by Dimier in his monograph on the artist; considered to be a copy by Johnson, Johnson\u2019s view that both drawings are connected with Fontainebleau, not Mantua, is supported by the fact that Theodor van Thulden made a drawing of two of the caryatids when he was studying the decorations in the palace of Fontainebleau. (McAllister Johnson pl. 12; also in the exhibition catalogue <i>Flemish Drawings of the seventeenth century from the collection of Frits Lugt</i>, London, Victoria and Albert Museum, 1972, no. 110, pl. 80). The evidence of style likewise favours the view that the first Louvre drawing (no. 3497) is by Primaticcio rather than by Giulio. Our drawing corresponds with the comparable part of the first Louvre drawing in almost every detail, though the latter is not heightened with gold paint. One of the few differences is that the private parts of the male herm and Cupid have been covered up in our drawing, doubtless by a later hand, as the brushwork is coarser here than in the rest. The rest of tehd arwing is very finely worked with brush ad pen in a manner that recalls Primaticcio, though not exactly his. It has been suggested that Ligozzi might be the artist. The gold paint and the fine technique are points in his favour, but he spent his working life a long way from Fontainebleau.",
