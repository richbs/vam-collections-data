The ceiling showed a large central medallion painted with a goddess (possibly Flora), surrounded by a deep framing band painted with upright, spirally fluted urns.  \n\nAround this is a further circular framing of interlaced garlands of bell flowers against a coloured ground, framing alternate circular panels with cast decoration of putti riding on dolphins with parrot heads, and rectangular panels with curved side, painted with goddesses making libations and sacrifices.  The outer edge of this circular fame is set alternately with trapezoidal panels each cast with a shallow urn flanked by squirrels, and with vesica shaped panels outlined in the bell-flower moudling and containing central circles cast with a design of four urns and four putti. \n\nThe spandrels are set with large, cast motifs of owls with bat wings, against a coloured ground, flanked by baskets with fruit. \n\nTwo sides of the ceiling are flanked with a border of interlaced circles of cast plasterwork, reeded, with small roundels at the intersections and figures of doves (cast) and larger circular cast roundels between the framing. Two sides have narrower borders with cast urns flanking long, rectangular painted panels. \n\nFurther description must be postponed until ceiling can be laid out.  Records state that some of the motifs were re-cast rather than removed at the time of acquisition and it is uncertain whether the ceiling came complete to the Museum.",

The house was built in 1770-1774 by a builder called Walter Cameron, and was probably designed by his son Charles Cameron (ca. 1743-1813), who later went on to become famous as architect to the Empress Catherine the Great of Russia.  His most famous work is at Catherine's country palace at Tsarskoy Selo. The house in Hanover Square is the only house in Britain which is associated with him.",

Charles Cameron: the lost early years', 'Apollo', January 1992, pp. 31-35.\nFig. 4 of this article illustrates the drawing for the Dining Parlour Ceiling at 15 Hanover Square.  In overall design, this relates to the ceiling now in the V&A but there are differences of detail, although the repertoire of motifs used is highly similar. Quoting from the MS accounts for the building of the house, now held in Hampshire Record Office, it is recorded that 'The decorative plasterwork was executed by Thomas Collins, who also worked for Sir William Chambers. Collins' breathless descriptions of his own work give the best idea of the rich and, perhaps somewhat cluttered, classical design in the Adam manner. The front parlour (dining-room) on the ground floor had a frieze with fifty-six griffins, fifty-six medallions, twenty-six \"potts enriched\" and twenty-eight oval frames. The ceiling was adorned with mask faces, rich sprigs, lilies and leaves, boys, dolphins, eight tablets of squirrels and baskets of fruit, griffins, supporting lamps, eight \"Basso Relievos of boys riding on flying tortoises\", a detail derived from a design by Giulio Romano and sketched by Cameron in 1764, four grotesque owls with large, extended \"batts' wings\", foliage, bells and husks, baskets of fruit with birds and grass hoppers, \"grotesque rich potts and vases with swans' lions' faces, etc.\" and \"batt wing\" ornament and eight tablets with moulded frames.' (pp. 34-5).  The drawing-room upstairs had equally rich plasterwork....'",
