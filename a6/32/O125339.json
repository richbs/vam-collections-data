The tokens, and possibly the machine, were made by the firm Accurate Check Taker Limited, which operated in Covent Garden and Soho from 1902 until 1944.\n\nTokens waiting to be issued were stacked on the vertical metal columns. When people paid for admission, the handle was turned corresponding to the relevant token, shaped differently for Pit or Stalls. The token was dispensed into a receptacle at the base of the unit, and  the 'Vernon Revolution Counter' (patented 1893) at the base of each stack recorded the numbers issued.  As they took their seats, patrons returned their tokens to ushers who collected them on a rod or string before returning them to the box office where the amount  issued could be cross-checked with the mechanical counter on the machine.",
