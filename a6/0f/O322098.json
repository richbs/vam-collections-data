William Bainbridge (d. 1831), a wood-turner and professional musician, introduced a version with an extra pipe, holes and keys in 1806. This instrument was made in 1829: the silver keys bear the hall-mark for that date. It is described as 'New Patent', and has an additional 'new C key' and 'new D key'.  Bainbridge seems to have followed the widespread practice of referring to patents that he was never actually granted, possibly to deter others from copying his instruments. In spite of various modifications, Bainbridge never succeded in making the flageolet as popular with musicians as the flute, and it fell into disuse by the 1850s.",
