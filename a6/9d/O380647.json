The honeysuckle ornament was used frequently by Adam - see the Adelphi railing on the staircase leading up to Gallery 118 - and was one of the most popular Neo- classical motifs. The combination of wrought (the frame) and cast (the rosettes and beehives) elements is also typical of Adam's designs. Cast iron was much cheaper to produce than wrought.",
