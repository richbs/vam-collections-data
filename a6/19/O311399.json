The coat of arms in the wreath (which would have been at the center of the lintel) is that of Stefano Trenta, Bishop of Lucca from 1448 until 1477. A distinguished diplomat and at one time Nuncio (papal ambassador) from Pope Paul II to King Edward IV of England, Stefano Trenta is recorded as having enlarged the Archbishop's Palace in Lucca between about 1470 and 1477. The style of carving suggests a follower of Francesco Simone di Ferrucci (1437-1493) of Fiesole, near Florence. There are a number of sculptures by the same hand in and around the Archbishop's Palace.",
