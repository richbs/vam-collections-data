            "public_access_description": "This portrait is a beautiful example of Chalon's elegant style, characterised by soft evanescent washes evoking the fluttering of drapery lit by strong sunlight. Chalon, unlike many of his contemporaries, seemed to relish the somewhat elaborate mode of dress of the 1830s. Indeed one writer has noted that \u2018at times there is a smack of the milliner\u2019s assistant about his love of ribbons and trimmings and early Victorian dress\u2019. Certainly, the highlight of Mrs de Wint's portrait is her hat, black trimmed with feathers and lace. \n\nHarriet, the wife of the famous landscape artist Peter de Wint, met her husband through her brother, William Hilton, de Wint's best friend. Harriet's memoirs reveal her devotion to both brother and husband. Her own life was given over to supporting and promoting her husband: \u2018A woman of great natural ability and very considerable culture, there is no doubt that her husband owed much of his success to her great social qualities and charming manners.\u2019 Certainly Chalon's dashing portrait is of a woman set to impress, perhaps at some smart private event.",
