            "public_access_description": "This is one of several wax figurines executed by Agatha Walker in the 1920s and 1930s, mostly of actors and actresses in character in successful London productions. The 19th century saw a craze for ceramic figurines of performers and Agatha Walker attempted to revive this tradition with her limited edition sculptures, modelled from life in plaster and coated with a fine wax layer which was then coloured.  In 1931 Agatha Walker's wax figures were exhibited at the Fine Art Society.\n\nThis represents Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies (1891-1992) as Etain in The Immortal Hour, the choral drama by Fiona Macleod with music by  Rutland Boughton first produced at Glastonbury Festival and then at  the Old Vic Theatre, 31 May 1920.   Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies' remarkable career spanned eighty years, from a walk-on part in the 1911 production of A Midsummer Night's Dream at His Majesty's Theatre to an appearance in the 1992 Sherlock Holmes television film The Master Blackmailer.  She was a link with Victorian theatre and a legendary figure of the English stage, hailed in 1924 as the finest Juliet of her generation for her 1924 with the 19 year-old John Gielgud's Hamlet.  She retired from the stage in 1970 but continued to work in radio and television until the end of her life. She was made a Dame of the British Empire in 1991 after much campaigning by senior theatrical figures. Aged 100, she was the oldest person to receive this honour.",
