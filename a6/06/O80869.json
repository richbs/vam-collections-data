Delaroche was soon hailed as the leader of the contemporary French school of history painting. In 1832 Delaroche was elected a member of the Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts, and the following year he became a professor at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, where his pupils included Thomas Couture (1815-1879) and Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me (1824-1904). \n\nThis painting was executed by Delaroche in 1836 and contrast somehow with his preceding works. It shows St Cecilia, saint patron of music, attending by angels kneeling before her. The very bright palette and somewhat archaic treatment provides a sense of ideal spirituality, which would influence the next generation of painter including Ingres (1780-1867).",

It was engraved by Francois Forster in 1841 (L'Artiste, 1841).

It depicts St Cecilia, dressed in white with a pale green cloak, attended by two angels kneeling before her. \nThe story of St Cecilia goes back to the 2nd or 3rd century. She was a young Christian who persuaded her husband, a Roman nobleman named Valerius, to convert to Christianity. On her way to her weeding, she is said to have heard some instruments hence her patronage of music. Her attribute is either a crown of flowers or a portative organ, such as in the present painting.  \nSt Cecilia was inspired here by Louise Vernet, daughter of the painter Horace Vernet, director of the French Academy in Rome, who married the artist in the chapel of St Cecilia in San Luigi dei Francesi, Rome. \nExecuted two years after the famous painting <i>The Execution of Lady Jane Grey</i> (National Gallery, London), this painting with its archaic treatment surprised the public and was ill received by the critic. After 1837, Delaroche ceased exhibiting altogether. \nThis painting, which borrows elements from the theme of the Annunciation, inaugurated a new phase in Delaroche's output which would almost exclusively focus on religious paintings onwards.  It shows his knowledge of earlier versions of the subject by the Italian masters Raphael and Domenichino. The unusual shape follows that of an early Italian altarpiece and may derive from Fra Angelico's <i>Annunication</i> in the Prado Museum, Madrid (P00015).\nDelaroche's bright palette, vibrant brushwork and porcelain-like finish would influence greatly the next generation of painters including Ingres and his pupils.",

            "historical_context_note": "History painting, i.e. depictions of non recurring events based on religious, classical, literary or allegorical sources, particularly developed in Italy during the Renaissance (15th-16th centuries). History painting could include religious themes, or depictions of momentous recent events, but the term was most frequently associated with Classical subject-matter. However a renewed impetus was given to religious subjects after the Council of Trent (1545-63), which stipulated new iconographical programmes. The development of art treatises, in which the compositional rules guiding the art of painting were discussed also notably, influenced the evolution of history painting. From around 1600 history painting's principal rivals: still-life, landscape and genre painting began to emerge as independent collectable genres. Furthermore, the Rococo taste for the ornamental in the early 18th century prioritised the decorative quality of history painting, so that subject matters became more entertaining than exemplary. There was a renewed interest in history painting during the Neo-Classical period after which the taste for such pictures faded towards the end of the 19th century when an innovative approach to the image was led by the Symbolists and was developed further by subsequent schools in the early 20th century.",
