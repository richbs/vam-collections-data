He stands on a dark green ground which rises in a lighter shade to a high horizon where it melds with the blue brush strokes of a suggested sky.\nThe man has a yellow halo with an outer band of gold denoting his royal birth. He wears a purple and gold turban with a <i>sarpech</i> and jewel attached to the front.  He also wears ropes of pearls with gem-stone pendants across his chest and pearl bracelets. He is dressed in a striped purple and gold fur-trimmed coat with three-quarter length sleeves over a bright red <i>jama</i>.  He has a gold <i>patka</i> and yellow boots decorated with gold foliated designs. The white hilt of a dagger is seen protruding from his <i>patka</i> at his waist and the end of  a purple-coloured sword sheath is visible sticking out behind him.  \n      The painting is framed with plain strips of collaged buff-coloured paper on a ivory-coloured ground which is decorated with a row of alternate poppies and lilies without the gold outlines and detailing seen on the borders of other pages in the album.  The page is edged with buff-coloured strips of paper with an additional beige-coloured strip on the right hand side to act as a gutter for the album binding. The edges of the page have been gilded.",
