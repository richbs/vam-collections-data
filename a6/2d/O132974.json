Oliver Messel had a large collection of objects that caught his eye, either for their design or construction and maybe the pleasing shape appealed to him.  Many designers squirrel away things that catch their fancy and might later be an inspiration for a design or the way to make a costume or headdress when they design a specific project.  \n\nMessel (1904-1978) was Britain's leading theatre designer from the early 1930s to the mid 1950s, working in every aspect of entertainment - ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue - as well as in interior decoration and textile design.  His lavish, painterly and romantic designs informed by period styles, were perfectly in tune with his times and earned him an international reputation.  By 1960, however, Messel's style had become unfashionable, having no sympathy with the new 'kitchen sink' school of theatre.  He increasingly concentrated on his non-theatrical painting and designing and eventually retired to the Caribbean, where he began a new career designing and building highly idiosyncratic luxury villas.",
