His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nMessel created costumes and sets inspired by late 19th-century French art for Dodie Smith\u2019s play, Letter from Paris (1952).  Adapted from Henry James\u2019s novel, The Reverberator (1908), the play explores the clash between American and aristocratic European values in late 19th-century Paris.  The production received a lukewarm reaction from critics and ran for only three weeks.\n\nMessel conjures up a Parisian scenic view of an arch as a  backcloth, a piece of cloth hanging at the back of the stage.  Critics praised the settings: \u2018The Messel sets give a pleasant sense of a Paris full of yellow carriages, tinkling bells, smells of fish and burned sugar, bandboxes with American labels, and studios of American pre-Impressionist painters.\u2019  (Guardian, October 14 1952)",
