The Christ Child holds an orb in his left hand, and may have been blessing with his right hand (now missing). The figure of the Virgin is plainly carved at the back. \nThis is a puzzling piece: in the past it was assigned to Portuguese Goa in India, and later to Latin America, perhaps Brazil. If so, the raw ivory would have been imported into Brazil. The drapery style and doll-like features of the Virgin's face seem to confirm that it was made in Brazil, since these correspond to sculptures made there during the time of Portuguese rule. It probably dates from the mid-17th century. There are traces of paint on the draperies and the eyes have been darkened.",
