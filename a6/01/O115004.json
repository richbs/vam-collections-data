Feldman was one of many designers to have their work produced by David Whitehead Limited during the 1950s.  The company, which was created in 1927, had already established a reputation by the 1950s for producing innovative design, which their director, John Murray wanted to be available to a mass market.  After Murray left the company in 1952, the architect and painter Tom Mellor took over, continuing to work with designers and artists to produce exciting and original designs.  This print is an example of a type of pattern that emerged from the Festival of Britain in 1951, based on abstract shapes in a style that was described as 'contemporary'.  David Whitehead Limited had been one of the major exhibitors of textiles at the Festival, and the patterns had a lasting influence on textile design in Britain throughout the 1950s.",
