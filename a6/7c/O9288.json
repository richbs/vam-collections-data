It was written by his court historian and biographer Abu'l Fazl between 1590 and 1596 and illustrataed concurrently by at least forty-nine different artists from Akbar's studio. After Akbar's death in 1605, this manuscript remained in the library of his son, Jahangir (r. 1605-27) and later Shah Jahan (r. 1628-58). The Victoria and Albert Museum purchased it in 1896 from the widow of Major General John Clarke, Commissioner of Oudh, India, between 1858 and 1862.  This partial manuscript is thought to be the earliest illustrated copy of the Akbarnama. It drew upon the expertise of some of the best royal painters of the time, many of whom receive special mention by Abu'l Fazl in the third volume of the Akbarnama, the A'in-i Akbari. The inscriptions in red ink on the bottom of the paintings refer to the artists and indicate that this was a royal copy.",
