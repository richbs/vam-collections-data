He was born in Hereford and came to London in 1737 to work as a wine merchant but made his London debut as an actor in 1741 at Goodman's Fields Theatre as Richard III. He managed the Theatre Royal Drury Lane from 1747 until 1776 and was depicted during his lifetime in many of his most famous roles, especially in paintings by Johann Zoffany (1733-1810).  He first played Tancred in James Thomson's tragedy Tancred and Sigismunda at Drury Lane Theatre on the 18th March 1745 and was painted in the role in 1752 by Thomas Worlidge. A pair to this figurine was produced of Susannah Cibber as Sigismunda.\n\nThe figurine of Garrick as Tancred, copied from a later engraving, was produced by the Derby porcelain factory, established in about 1750 by the Huguenot, Andrew Planche.  In partnership with William Duesbury they produced figures of extremely high quality.  By 1770, Duesbury acquired the famous Chelsea China Works and the Bow moulds which resulted in the transfer of a number of extremely skilled craftsmen from London to Derby. They opened a London showroom in 1773, and in 1775 King George III  granted the factory the honour of being able to incorporate a crown into the backstamp.",
