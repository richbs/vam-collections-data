It was produced at The County Cinema, Kinross in January 1941 after the Concert Party had been in existence for almost three months. A repeat show was given for patients later at the Ochil Hills Sanitorium.\n\nThe Home Guard was founded in Great Britain in May 1940 as the Local Defence Volunteers, when there was a real risk of invasion in Great Britain.  Their members were those who were either too old or too young to join the regular forces, or who worked in so-called reserved occupations.  Winston Churchill changed their name to the Home Guard in August 1940.
