In its branches perch two oversized pigeons.\n\nChinese blue-and-white porcelain had been popular in Iran since the the 14th century and  Iranian potters began making imitations soon after.  Production rose sharply in the 17th century, perhaps because the Chinese  wares were temporarily unavailable.\n\nSome of the Iranian wares were close imitations of Chinese originals and even had copies of Chinese maker\u2019s marks on the base. Other items were obviously inspired by Chinese pottery but have a shape or decoration that is typically Iranian. The painted decoration on the underside is similar to a dish dated AH 1077 / 1666 AD (931-1886), also in the V&A collection.",
