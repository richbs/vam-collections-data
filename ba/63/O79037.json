The set also included four ottomans (a low upholstered sofa) and eight small chairs and stools. The original upholstery was grey-striped and patterned silk, trimmed with cord and gimp.\n\nPlaces\nNorthumberland House, London, was the home of the 3rd Duke of Northumberland. After structural alterations to the south wing of the house, in 1822 he commissioned Morel & Hughes to refit all the interiors, including the suite of grand reception rooms on the first floor. The anti-room, for which this chair was provided, was the first of this sequence of rooms, reached by the Grand Staircase. In 1874 the house was demolished to make way for new roads.\n\nPeople\nNicolas Morel and Robert Hughes were partners in a cabinet-making and upholstery business at 13 Great Marlborough Street, London, from 1805 until 1826. Their commissions included work at Carlton House, London, for the Prince of Wales, later the Prince Regent, and several aristocratic clients. As well as new furniture and upholstery for Northumberland House, the firm supplied protective loose covers of leather, linen and cotton for this chair and the rest of the set.",

This example is one of a pair, part of a suite of furniture commissioned by the 3rd Duke of Northumberland from Morel & Hughes, the London firm of upholsterers and cabinet-makers. The suite was supplied for the Ante-Room to the Crimson Drawing Room, Northumberland House, London, in 1823. The two berg\u00e8res were made of Astronium fraxinifolium, also known as gonzalo alvez or zebrawood, which was supplied by the Duke. \n\nThe bill, dated 31st March 1823 (Northumberland Archives UI 64) lists: \n'2 bergeres, from the antique, of your Graces aburra wood, highly polished, & richly carved & gilt with ornamented trusses, foliage leaves, scroll sides, &c the tablet back, & seats stuffed with the best horsehair in canvas, standing on brass socket castors \n                                                                                                               \u00a3225 16s\nTo covering the seats, backs, & tablets of the bergeres with grey silk, lined with calico, & finished with silk gimps, & cord in suit                                                  \u00a35 18s'    \n\n\nThe two berg\u00e8res, and six side chairs from the suite, were sold from the collection of David Style at Wateringbury Place by Christie's, 1 June 1978. A squab cushion from one of the side chairs is also in the Museum's collection (Museum No. W.46-1980). The second berg\u00e8re, and two of the side chairs, were acquired by Towneley Hall Art Gallery, Burnley.\n\nOther pieces from the suite, including two side chairs and eight stools, remain in the collection of the Duke of Northumberland.",
