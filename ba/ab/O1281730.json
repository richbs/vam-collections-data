However they did not treat this greatest of English cultural icons with undue reverence: not only is his name rearranged, but the poems are interspersed with, and interrupted by, overprinting and collage, sometimes to the point of semi-illegibility. Brightly-coloured geometric shapes, and further texts, in German, are taken from modern books on various aspects of mortality \u2013 a strong theme in Shakespeare's sonnet sequence. \n\nThe slim volume is bound in delicate paper boards covered with tissue. Traditionalist craft values  combine with a modernist poetic sensibility of fracture, fragmentation and allusion. The bold and busy visual style is characteristic of late 20th-century graphic design.",
