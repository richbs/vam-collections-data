Protruding from the back is a cut away cone shape which is open at the end. In the final product this becomes flat with a door hatch. The top is high at the back slowly sloping to a shallow nose. The top is moulded to show the large round turret on the left, a forward hatch, an oval hatch on the right and square hatches at the back. The engine exhaust pipe is on the right side and there are several walkway grip pads over the surface which itself has been given a rough texture.",
