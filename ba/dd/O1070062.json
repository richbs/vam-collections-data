XI (as <i>Thurloe</i> by Cooper); FAS 1897, no. 49. \n\n<b>Literature:</b> Propert 1887, repro. facing p. 78; Williamson 1904, vol. I, p. 74, pl. XXXVII, no. 2 (as <i>Thurloe</i> by Cooper, owner unknown); Foster 1911 (\u2018The other Coopers comprise ... the heavy lymphatic face of Secretary Thurloe\u2019): Foster 1914-16, vol. II, p. 71, nos 461-2 (both entries are for this miniature); Long 1930, p. 13 (as ascribed to Cooper and 'on bone'); Colding 1953, p. 124; <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 9 (as said to be Thurloe and formerly ascribed to Cooper). \n\nThe miniature seems to derive from images which were, in the eighteenth century, accepted as being of Thurloe, Secretary of State in charge of Foreign Affairs under the Commonwealth. Several prints, including especially the engraving by T Chambers published in Smollett's <i>History of England</i> (1757), and deriving variously from Houbraken in 1738, were stated in the publication line to come ultimately from Cooper. Significantly, the prints are in the opposite sense from the miniature, which would have reinforced the belief that the present miniature was the original of this portrait type. \n\nSince Piper 1963, however, the accepted images of Thurloe have been those of the type represented in the NPG and propagated in the eighteenth century through Vertue's engraving of 1741. In addition, a miniature in the Buccleuch Collection (2) 'agrees well enough in features\u2019 (3) and is tentatively included in Davies's listing. (4) The Cooper/Houbraken type, on the other hand, 'probably does not represent' Thurloe, according to Piper, a judgement accepted by Davies. \n\nAs to the artist, the attribution to Cooper has long since been abandoned.  Reynolds, influenced by the eighteenth-century acceptance of this image of Thurloe, noted in the departmental copy of Long 1930 'an eighteenth-century fake'. Long's judgement had been more tolerant: in his usage the phrase 'ascribed to' implied a higher degree of credence than it does now. He would have been influenced by the quality of the draughtsmanship in the face-painting, which is fast and accurate and, although not by a recognisable hand, is well within the range of normal mid-seventeenth-century technical practice. The slightly mechanical way of modelling the features in long strokes of the brush laid beside one another suggests an influence from the craft of engraving. This could be because the artist was in this instance copying a particular print (as Reynolds might argue), or because he was himself an engraver, (5) or because he had learnt to draw partly from engravings in teaching books (as Snelling may have done). Jim Murrell's comment, preserved in a note in the conservation record on this miniature, was 'features in coarse washy strokes (vide Snelling)'. The miniature does not to my eye actually look like a Snelling, though perhaps if he had been copying a Cooper, the result might have been something like this. \n\nEarlier, the miniature had been a victim of the myth that Cooper sometimes painted on bone. (6) Long spent some time worrying about this, rather than working on the iconography or thinking seriously about the authorship. He noted: ' I took out the backboard on 30.1.11, but the miniature, which appeared to be on bone (!) & was goldbeatered on to the glass, would not easily come out, so I left it.' Later (8.9.13), still without stripping the gold-beater's skin, he commented: 'Judging from the back of the min. it is on bone. The surface does not look quite like the usual \"prepared\" card.\u2019 (7) Long's reluctance to dismantle objects was admirable, even when as here the fixings were the work of a recent restorer or framer. When the miniature was eventually released from attachment to the glass, it was obvious that the secondary support was the normal table-book leaf. \n\n1 Salting Collection, no. 4626. \n2 Kennedy 1917. p. 36. as in the style of or after Samuel Cooper. \n3 Piper 1963, p. 344. \n4 Davies 1979, vol.Lp. 136.p. 136. \n5 Faithorne was said by de Piles to have painted in miniature, though no works are known to have survived. \n6 See Williamson 1904, vol. I. p. 77; Williamson cites a miniature in his own collection as an example of the practice, but confuses it with the present miniature in his reference to the illustrations of both on pl. XXXVII.
