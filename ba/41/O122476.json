The front has three panels, the centre one carved with a conventional pomegranate, the other two each with a male (right) and female (left) bust in profile.  The stiles and rails are moulded, and joined with mason's mitres; the top rail is incised with the inscription, FERE GOD T [missing initial]LOVE GOD.  The lid is fitted with four panels in a moulded framework.\n\nWith a till (proper left) missing its lid.\nOf frame and panel construction (pegged tenon and mortise joints), supplemented by iron brackets (hand forged, with hand-made nails) at the corners, one at rear left is thinner than the others. The lid also of panelled construction, with scratch mouldings on the exterior and stopped chamfers on the inside. 3 original split ring hinges holding the lid to the back rail, supplemented by two added butterfly hinges held on quatrefoil nails. Note that there are visible trenches in the stiles where peg holes were drilled in the mortices. The inscription on the rail (chip carved with chisels) has been interrupted with an excavated hole for a hasp lock (now missing), causing the loss of an initial, though the escutcheon appears to be original.\n\nIt appears that the front may have been removed intact and refastened, probably at the same time as the bottom boards were replaced with 7 modern tongue and groove boards; some of the pegs reused, others lost and not replaced). The PR rear lower metal bracket much newer than the others which appear to be of early date. Screws and modern nails have been added to reinforce the lid joints. The front left corner tenon is broken.  At some point a supporting sub-rail seems to have been fixed with nails between the front and rear lower rails. With an applied varnish after surface cleaning. The interior fitted (20th century) with two wires through ring fittings to stabilise the structure.",

Many good judges have been deceived by this fanciful resemblance, and at least on chest of this type may be found in the Victoria and Albert Museum wrongly ascribed to the early part of the sixteenth century.
