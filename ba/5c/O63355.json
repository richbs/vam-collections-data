In the late 19th century most fashionable shirts were made by firms like Welch Margetson, Foster Porter & Co and McIntyre Hogg & Co.   Cassell's Household Guide (1869-70, London, New York, Cassell, Petter and Galpin) reported: \n\n'Shirt-making at home has fallen into disesteem, a result chiefly referable to two reasons.  First, on the part of men, because home-made shirts are so ill cut as to be uncomfortable, untidy, and soon soiled; second, because the labour of shirt-making is close and unpleasant, and undoubtedly, trying to womankind\u2026..\n\nThe supremacy of shop-made shirts, as they are called, have obtained over home-made, is due to the superiority of their cut.  Home-made almost invariably 'bag', as the expressive term is, at the front or breast. This is because they are cut too wide at the breast.'",
