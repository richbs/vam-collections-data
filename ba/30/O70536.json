            "public_access_description": "Kharak Singh (1801\u20131840) was the second Sikh Maharaja of the Punjab  and succeeded his father, Ranjit Singh, in June 1839. He was frail in constitution and unable to withstand the plotting against him that took place as rival factions at court tried to take power. His most trusted courtier and former tutor, Chet Singh, was murdered in front of him in 1839 by Dhian Singh, a member of the Hindu Dogra family, and Kharak Singh was then effectively Dhian Singh\u2019s prisoner. He was slowly poisoned and died on 5 November 1840.",
