It bears the Medici arms surmounted by a coronet (meant for the Grand Ducal crown) lacking the fleur-de lys, symbol of the city of Florence, normal feature of the Medici arms, this is probably just due to an inaccuracy of the potter; if the dish would have been made for one of the Medici the arms would have been painted more accurately. Also the presence of a manufacturing fault on the front of dish suggests that this dish wasn't part of a special commission meant for the Medici.\n\nThe shape of the coat of arms is typical of early Baroque style.",
