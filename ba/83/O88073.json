The weft is composed of threads of different colours which do not pass across the width of the fabric, from selvedge to selvedge, but are carried backwards and forwards in small areas where they are required for the design.  Traditional tapestry uses a plain weave structure which tends to produce a fairly thick and stiff hanging.  In contrast, Iranian weavers copied the Kashmir shawl technique of using a twill weave which produces a softer fabric, more easy to fold and drape.\nThe weaver worked from a detailed written list giving the sequence in which the coloured wefts were to be used; the fabric was woven from the back."

All rather stylised and  isolated. The red ground is dominated by a cypress tree outlined with yellow and white banding and with 4-petalled rosettes in red and purple.  The centre of the tree is light blue with symmetrically placed motifs similar to those in the spandrels.  The tree emerges from a cauldron-like container echoing the spandrel's colours and motifs and supported by a light blue palmette like motif with an irregular central yellow lozenge and rosettes.\nHalf way up the tree, to either side, is a stylised candle-stick like motif and a peacock, both with a blue ground and decorated with small motifs.  At the apex to the arch is a pair of large green parakeets; their heads and neck are outlined with two lines of couched metal thread.\nThe rest of the field is covered with small composite motifs in offset rows: alternately a flowering plant in blue, red and purple or something reminiscent of a double-headed eagle in green, red and blue.\nThere are multiple borders around all four sides.
