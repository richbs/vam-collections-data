In 1861 he worked in Gustave Courbet's studio for several months as a pupil. After a period of portraiture, Fantin-Latour concentrated on flowers paintings and still-lifes for which he is now best known. His flower pieces were especially popular with British collectors, and he exhibited at the Royal Academy in London from 1862 onwards, especially thanks to the patronage of James McNeill Whistler (1834-1903), whom he met in 1858.\n\nThis painting is a fine example of Fantin-Latour's flower piece, a category in which he progressively specialised executing up to 500 floral compositions. This painting shows a bouquet of iris, delphiniums and wallflowers harmoniously arranged in a glass vase standing on the corner of a table. The attention here is drawn on the rich combination of textures and tones, which contrast with the plain dark background. These effects of light and colour are characteristic of the new naturalism developed in French art in the second half of the 19th century, which anticipate the Impressionists' new experimentations.",

This, one of the latest of the three irises to flower, is known, even in France, as the \"English Iris\". The softer, midnight blue flowers are <i>Delphinium</i> hybrids, while the white flowers which link with the splashes of white at the centre of each delphinium flower are dame's violet, <i>Hesperis matronalis</i>, an old French garden plant. The latter each have four petals in the form of a cross, an attribute of the cabbage family (<i>Cruciferae</i>), although there is nothing cabbage-like about the delicious fragrance of these flowers, especially on a warm summer evening, hence its genus name which derives from the Greek word for this time of day. \n       All the flowers are florists' favourites, but the fruits have a fresh-picked look. The cherries are probably Morellos, whilst the green fruits with long, pointed leaves are ripening almonds (<i>Prunus dulcis</i>, from the Latin for \"plum\", to which almonds are related, plus \"sweet\"). The artist has captured perfectly the juciness of the cherries and the soft greyish furriness of the outer coat of the almonds, so easily damaged by careless picking, but here completely unmarked.'\nAndrew Watson, 'Constantine Ionides and his Collection of 19th-Century French Art', <u>Journal of the Scottish Society for Art History </u>, vol. 3, 1998, pp.25-31 -cf. p.28, n.17.",

It shows a composition of different flowers harmoniously arranged in a simple glass vase standing on the corner of a table.\n \nThis picture draws the attention onto the contrast between light and shade, the brilliant colours of the flowers against the formless plain background, and the cool palette of the purple iris, blue delphinium and white wallflowers against the cherries' deep red and yellowish green of the almonds. The artist shows here sensitivity for the rendering of different textures: flowers, fruits and nuts. \n\nAlthough this painting was painted in France, London was the principal market for Fantin-Latour's flower pieces, and in 1871 the amateur etcher and dealer Edwin Edwards purchased all of the painter's stock for sale in England. \n\nThe Ionides bequest of 1901 doubled the size of the museum's collection of flower pieces by Fantin-Latour, which already included three painting acquired in 1882, 1884 and 1889 from Mrs Ruth Edwards, the widow of Edwin Edwards (see S.Ex.61-1882, S.Ex.24-1884 and S.Ex.4-1889). \n\nThe Barbizon school encouraged a new interest in naturalism and the objective rendering of light and colours, which was continued by the Impressionists. However, Fantin-Latour did not share their enthusiasm for open air painting and most of his compositions were executed in his studio.",

            "historical_context_note": "19th-century French art is marked by a succession of movements based on a more or less close relationship with nature. At the beginning of the century, Romantic artists were fascinated by nature they interpreted as a mirror of the mind. They investigated human nature and personality, the folk culture, the national and ethnic origins, the medieval era, the exotic, the remote, the mysterious and the occult. This movement was heralded in France by such painter as Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix (1798-1863). In its opposition to academic art and its demand for a modern style Realism continued the aims of the Romantics. They assumed that reality could be perceived without distortion or idealization, and sought after a mean to combine the perception of the individual with objectivity. This reaction in French painting against the Grand Manner is well represented by Gustave Courbet (1819-1877) who wrote a 'Manifesto of Realism', entitled <i>Le R\u00e9alisme</i> published in Paris in 1855. These ideas were challenged by the group of the Barbizon painters, who formed a recognizable school from the early 1830s to the 1870s and developed a free, broad and rough technique. They were mainly concerned by landscape painting and the rendering of light. The works of Narcisse Virgile Diaz de la Pe\u00f1a (1807-1876), Jules Dupr\u00e9 (1811-1889), Th\u00e9odore Rousseau (1812-1867), Constant Troyon (1810-1865) and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet (1814-1875) anticipate somehow  the <i>plein-air</i> landscapes of the Impressionists.",
