            "public_access_description": "Lucas Cranach is best known for his paintings. He also made woodcuts for his patron Elector Frederick III of Saxony, for whom he was court artist from 1504. This is a woodcut portrait of Sybilla of Cleves, who married the Elector\u2019s nephew in 1527. The unusual framing device suggests that it was most likely copied from a painted portrait by Cranach. \n\nCranach\u2019s workshop, run by himself and his two sons with the help of assistants, produced numerous painted or woodcut portraits of the Electors and their circle. The faces were often copied from oil studies kept in the workshop for the purpose, because the Cranachs relied on assistants to fulfil the large number of commissions. \n\nThe frame added to this image has shading on the top and left sides as though it is casting a shadow. We do not know how this print was used but the trompe l\u2019oeil frame suggests that the portrait could have been intended for display on a wall.",
