One of the numbered designs, P.42 is identical with an unnumbered one inscribed 'Creeping [amended to 'Night']  Cerus'.  Another design (E.458(174, 175)) is without number or title. \nIncorporated in the designs are 22 originally used by Robert Maxwell at Merton Abbey, Surrey.  Maxwell went out of business in 1783 and these plates were probably taken over by the Bromley Hall Works at that time.  The designs fall within the numerical sequence P.108 to P.146 in the Bromley Hall system of enumeration. \nFor an account of the history of the Bromley Hall Works see p.22 of the Catalogue of the Loan Exhibition of English Chintz, held at the Victoria and Albert Museum, 1960, in which this pattern-book was exhibited (Catalogue No.88) together with 18 printed textile specimens of the designs.  Also on p.22 is a note on Robert Maxwell and on pp.23-25 of the Catalogue some information is given about the sources of the designs.\"\nLambert, Susan (ed.) <u>Pattern & Design: Designs for the Decorative Arts 1480-1980</u> London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1983\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n'<b>1.7.b Foster & Co., Bromley Hall</b>\n\nVolume containing impressions (233 pieces) pasted in, of 144 copperplate designs for printing on textiles, some of the impressions being large sheets cut into two parts and pasted on facing pages. The designs are in two groups, the first mainly of flowers and foliage (120) from a series numbered by the manufacturer P.1 to P.185; the second (24) with figures, birds and animals amid floral decoration, is unnumbered but inscribed in ink with brief titles. Pasted inside the front cover is a sheet of paper watermarked 1801, inscribed in ink with an incomplete list of pattern numbers and titles of designs. Full bound in calf, with two bronze clasps. English, c. 1760-1800.\n\nInscribed in ink throughout the volume with numbers, titles, notes etc. Lettered on labels on the front and back covers <i>Foster's Bromley</i>.\nEngravings. Size of volume 55.9 x 35.6 cm\n\nGiven by the Calico Printers' Association Ltd\nE.458 (1-223) - 1955\n\nLiterature: <i>Loan exhibition of English chintz</i>, Victoria and Albert Museum, 1960, p.22.\n\nThe volume, which constitutes the pattern-book of Foster &amp; Co., is open at two plates (E.458.182, 183) which show three elements inthe design of the 'Pagoda' cotton (cat. no. 1.7.c): a pavilion, a tree trunk under which is a fisherman, and a merchant conversing with a musician.\n\nThe Bromley Hall factory on the right bank of the River Lea in Poplar, Middlesex, was probably the largest of the early print works. It is first mentioned in the 1740s and was operated successively by members of the Ollive family (dyers and calico printers since the late 17th century), Joseph Talwin, and the Foster family, under the name of Ollive and Talwin (1763-1783), Talwin and Foster (1785-1790) and Foster and Co (1790-1823). The Ollives, Talwins and Fosters were all Quakers and probably interrelated.'",
