The colour and pattern of the silk are very similar to another group of samples associated with Windsor Castle, and noted in the royal accounts for 1853. (This is also displayed in the British Galleries. See museum no. T.269-1965). \n\nThese examples are likely to be of a later date but are closely based on the earlier furnishings. The decorative ribbon stripe has been integrated into the full width of the plain green silk, rather than being woven as a separate ribbon. The silk appears in the records of the London silk weavers Warner and Ramm for 21 December 1887. It was woven for client 'R.S & T', who has not been identified. The design is in reverse from the 1853 sample. \n\nSilks for mid-19th-century schemes at Buckingham Palace, London, and Windsor Castle were woven by two firms in Spitalfields, London: Daniel Walters & Sons and Norris & Co.  In 1885 the firm of Norris & Co. was taken over by Warner and Ramm, who also took over many of their clients. Warner's first identifiable royal order for Windsor came from the decorators W. Williamson & Sons of Guildford, Surrey, in 1887.",
