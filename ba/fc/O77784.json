A complete altarpiece of this type, the Swansea Altarpiece (museum no. A.89-1919), is also displayed in the British Galleries.  As explained in the inscription on the case, this panel was only later transformed into a single sculpture, with  painted panels serving as wings.\n\nTime\nThe vast majority of the late medieval sculptures of England was destroyed in the period between 1535 and 1555, during the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII and the subsequent Reformation. Individuals who were sympathetic to the Catholic Church, or had an attachment to individual pieces, occasionally tried to hide or preserve these works of art.  Given its good condition, it is likely that this panel was hidden in the house referred to in the inscription - probably a monastic foundation - and only came to light a century and a half later.  Its reuse in the late 17th century is a rare and early example of antiquarian, possibly Roman Catholic, interest in medieval imagery.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe moment of Christ's Ascension to Heaven is shown. Only the feet and lower draperies of Christ are visible as he rises from the flat stone at the middle of the composition.  Small angels swing censers to each side and, below, the Virgin and eleven Apostles gaze upwards in astonishment. Most of the Apostles are identified by their attributes. St Andrew, for instance, holds his large X-shaped cross and St Peter his key, tucked under his armpit.",
