The long shoulder-bands are filled with foliage having hares and antelopes at intervals.  On the cuff-bands are wavy stems with flowers and fruit.  The neck-bands each consist of an arcade of four semi-circular arches with classical figures, some of whom are dancing.  The neck-opening is edged with a narrow band containing vases separated by small panels of interlaced ornament.  Two square panels on the shoulders contain circles of guilloche ornament enclosing foliage.  The smaller squares, near the lower edge on both back and front, each contain a lion attacking an antelope.  A small cross on the front neck-band is probably an indication of the religious faith of the wearer.  About one third of the width of the tunic, including one sleeve, is missing.  Arcades with a figure under each arch are a favourite decoration of sarcophagi in the fourth century.",
