Nesfield's choice of mood, however, is rougher and bleaker; the waves smash against the rocks of that dangerous coastline, battering the fishing boat in the sudden storm, and creating alarm among the onlookers on the desolate beach.  As with sunrise and sunset in landscape, it is difficult to determine whether the storm has just begun, or is nearing its end; perhaps the darkly heavy pall of cloud and wind which move from the right to obscure the sun (the direction is indicated by the flag on the castle tower) means this is the onset of the tempest.",

He belonged to a young generation of artists who were beginning to experiment with the watercolour medium. They challenged the typical 18th century landscape.", 
            "exhibition_history": "", 
            "bibliography": "It seems that Nesfield was a 'gentleman artist', rather than a painter who had to make his living by his work. Educated at Winchester College and Trinity, Cambridge, his first career was in the army, from which he retired as lieutenant on half-pay. A Member of the Old Watercolour Society, he also wrote on medieval architecture and designed landscaped gardens, eventually giving up painting to concentrate on these other interests. He travelled extensively in the British Isles, and visited the Alps, and seems to have been most inspired by dramatic landscapes such as the present subject.",
