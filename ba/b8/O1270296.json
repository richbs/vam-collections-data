This includes a head and shoulders profile image of Terry, framed on the left hand side by a portrait of Edward VII (1841-1910) and on the right hand side, his wife, Queen Alexandra (1844-1925). Gold metallic ink has been used to create the border and add highlights to the union flags and other details with which the programme is decorated.\nThe image of Terry is copied from a photograph of the actress, taken by the photographer Alexander Bassano (1829-1913) in 1883.",

Produced to commemorate the performance staged to mark the Stage Jubilee of the actress Ellen Terry (1847-1928) at the Drury Lane Theatre, on Tuesday June 12th 1906. \n\nBorn into an acting family Terry was one of the leading actresses of the late nineteenth century and is perhaps most famous for her twenty two year on stage partnership with the actor/manager Sir Henry Irving (1838-1905). This Jubilee celebration marked fifty years since Terry's first stage performance. She appeared alongside Charles Kean at the Princess Theatre in 1856, as Mamillius in The Winter's Tale,by William Shakespeare's (1564-1616).",
