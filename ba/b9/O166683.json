            "public_access_description": "St George was a legendary saint and martyr, said to have been born in Cappadocia in Asia Minor and to have died at Lydda in Palestine about the end of the 3rd century A.D. He was made patron saint of England in 1222. According to the Golden Legend, a 13th-century collection of saints' lives, St George was said to have fought a dragon by the sea-shore, outside the walls of a city, in order to rescue the king's daughter who was being offered as a sacrifice. Often depicted as a medieval knight on a white horse, St George slaying the dragon came to symbolise the victory of Christianity over sin and paganism.\n\nThis carving follows closely other 15th-century representations of St George in various media such as illuminated manuscripts. It probably formed part of the end of a choir stall or bench, from a church in Norwich. Stalls for the clergy provided seats raised off the cold, stone floor, sometimes with intricate canopies and statues above. The congregation occupied the nave of the church, standing or, from the 1200s onwards, seated on wooden benches. Much superb Medieval woodwork still remains in East Anglican churches.",

The wall painting depicting the same subject at St Gregory, Norwich displays similar horse trappings. The general disposition of the composition and the way the dragon's tail is wound round the back leg of the horse, are also comparable.\nCharles Tracy, English Medieval Furniture and Woodwork (London, 1988)\n\nIan Cobb (in correspondence with Nick Humphrey, 2008), discovered that 'an old oak carving representing St George and the dragon' was recorded in visitation records of 1886 and 1894 in the vestry of  St George's church, Tombland (Norwich). Plans to reseat the church 'using the old oak' were drawn up c1877-1880, and the restoration of the church by Euan Christian seems to have taken place by 1885. No medieval fixed woodwork survives in the church. Building work on the tower took place in 1445.",
