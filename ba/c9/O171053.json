            "public_access_description": "Ralph Koltai designed this costume for Brunnhilde in English National Opera's hugely successful production of Wagner's Ring cycle in the early 1970s.  Brunnhilde was sung by Rita Hunter, who made an outstanding impression in the role.  She was in the popular image of Wagnerian sopranos - substantial and heroic, although not tall - but her size brought an emotional, as well as physical weight, to the warrior maiden.  \nIn his designs, Koltai eschewed the clich\u00e9d horned helmet and armour of Nordic epic and turned to the new fabrics of the period.  The result was a simple, uncluttered dress of grey 'elephant hide' pvc, which suggested the warrior maiden.  There were several design features which helped break up the width of Hunter's body - two front panels on the dress, the overcoat, formed of strips of leather, a silvery material (now missing) and shorter string braids and the sheen of the fabric under the stage lights.  \nThe breastplate also used contemporary materials, being moulded Perspex, the plates linked by leather straps.  It would have been horribly unyielding to wear and breathing must have been uncomfortable, but it fitted perfectly into Koltai's steely, futuristic, science-fiction world.",

The role was sung by Rita Hunter.\n\nHistorical significance: English National Opera's production of Wagner's Ring Cycle was one of the most acclaimed British Wagnerian productions of the century.   It translated Wagner into a gleaming modern sci-fi world, stressing the universailty of the themes and characters.  Rita Hunter's Brunnhilde and Normal Bailey's Wotan, proved conclusively that Britain could produce great Wagnerian singers.",
