The Fugger family was a historically prominent group of European bankers from the southern German city of Augsburg. They traded throughout Europe and funded military and political campaigns. They were accepted in princely circles as they not only acted as patrons for artists and scholars, but advanced huge loans such as when the Emperor Charles V needed to pay the electors who appointed him.\n\nNo details of the provenance of the object are known. It was bought by the Museum in 1921 for \u00a320 from Mr C.F. Corbould Ellis of Stevenage, Herts. (RP 31/3491).\n\nHistorical significance: Not only is this dial engraved with the arms of Fugger-Kirchberg-Weissenhorn, an important German family of bankers, it was also made by one of the most celebrated scientific instrument makers of the 16th century. \n\nChristopher Schissler's workshop was famous in his own time. He was born in around 1531 and started his workshop after 1550. He supplied precision instruments of  exquisite quality including globes, astrolabes, sundials,  armillary spheres, astronomical compendia and surveying and drawing equipment. Schissler's clientele was international. Many of his dials are laid out for English or Italian latitudes. In 1571 Schissler travelled to the Dresden court of August I, the Elector of Saxony, in order to set up and demonstrate his instruments. He also visited in 1583 the court of Emperor Rudolf II in Prague who was well-known for his fascination with clocks. From 1580 Schissler produced many surveying instruments and became invloved with the survey of the town of Augsburg between 1598 and 1602.\n\nAround a hundred instruments from Schissler's workshop survive. His eldest son Christopher Schissler Junior (also known as Hans Christoph) also became an instrument maker. Christoph Schissler Senior died on 14 September 1608.",

This plain dial has the hours of the day engraved on both dials but more elaborate ones were designed to be used in more than one latitude, with a series of holes in the upper leaf, through which the string could be threaded to adjust its angle to the correct latitude. \n\nSpecialist makers of scientific instruments catered for an increased interest in navigation, travel, geography and the workings of the universe.
