Christ's right hand is simply raised and is neither in the usual position of blessing nor pointing downwards towards Malchus. Next to Christ is a soldier, wearing armour, whom Christ touches with his left hand. The soldier grasps Christ's cloak, drawing his sword with his right hand. Behind him is the damaged figure of another soldier. St. Peter, haloed and bearded, stands behind Christ on the left of the panel, holding his sheathed sword vertically in both hands. At his feet on a lower level is seated the figure of Malchus, wearing a short-belted tunic and boots, his right leg bent back, holding a staff in his left hand and holding his ear with his right hand. The ground at the bottom of the panel is unusually and intricately worked.\n\nThe top of the panel is missing. The bottom of Malchus' head is damaged. The head of the soldier in the top right corner is missing. The alabaster shows iron staining in the bottom left corner.\n\nTraces of gilding remain on the hair and beards of Christ and St. Peter. Green paint remains on the ground, with traces of the usual daisy pattern. There are slight traces of red on the mouths of the figures. The back of the panel is deeply incised with a large vertical mark. The bottom has been cut away and also there has been scooped out a vertical trough three-quarters of the way up the panel. There are four lead plugs holding latten wires.",
