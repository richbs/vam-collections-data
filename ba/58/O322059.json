            "physical_description": "Cupboard of boarded construction with pierced, tracery ornament and a single, central pierced door. The top formed of a single board 1.8 to 2.2cm thick, which is pegged and nailed down to the front, back and ends. With two repaired infill patches at the back corners. The sides are both formed from a single plank, to which are nailed the two side front stiles with integral, carved arch feet. (In the right side is a rectangular patch at mid-height with hammered tin(?)-plate behind over white filler.) At the top the two front stiles are nailed onto a batten of (new?) oak, protruding in the centre above the door so that it is flush with the stiles. The back consists of 4 vertically-grained planks (one split), butted and nailed and to rebates cut in the sides, and to a top, inner rail. The door is a single board with replacement sections half-lapped in at the top (15cm high) and at the bottom (20cm), and with an iron 'horseshoe' bracket added behind, held on 4 old butterfly hinges (but no sign of iron staining inside). The 4 tracery 'cut-outs' with uniform shallow rebates behind are in fact inserts from the back, sitting against a shallow rebate; the piercing in the door is cut in the solid. The bottom of the cupboard is a single plank, with a neat projecting 'lip' below the door.\n\nTraces of brown paint on the back of the door. Apparently made from fast-growth oak. \n\nAlthough this cupboard might be an essentially old structure with extensive restoration (top, floor, with replaced tracery piercings, and new hinges and possibly replaced door) it is more likely to be a relatively recent creation, given what seems to be the anachronistic structural design, notably the inner top 'rail' reinforcing the front, and projecting lip to the floor board, and the uniform finish and 'old' repairs. The butted joints all seem to be straight and tight.\n\nThicknesses of timbers:\nFront stiles: 21mm (right), 23-24mm (left)\nTop c20mm\nSides c23mm\nDoor 21-3mm\nMid shelf 18mm\nBottom shelf 20mm",
