The Wellington Shield was silver-gilt and designed by the artist Thomas Stothard, R.A. (1755-1834). In the centre is the figure of the Duke of Wellington, crowned by Victory. Around the sides of the shield are 10 rectangular cartouches, 8 of which show scenes from the Peninsular War. The scene shown on this model represents the entry into Toulouse in 1814.\n\nThomas Strothart was an English painter, illustrator and designer and was one of the most successful and prolific artists of his time. After an apprenticeship as silk-weaver he studied at the Royal Academy. Book illustration was one main area of his engagement and he developed an austere and linear style of draughtsmanship. He also undertook several large-scale commissions for wall painting / murals in buildings such as for example Burghley House.\nBesides painting and illustration he also designed vignettes, roundels, invitation cards and banknotes, Wedgewood jasperware reliefs and silverwork, like the Wellington Shield dealt with here, of which he also modelled the relief figures himself too.",
