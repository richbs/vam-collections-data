It is possibly made by Christopher Dresser, in ca. 1880.\nThe designer, writer and botanist Christopher Dresser (1834-1904) trained at the Government School of Design, London, from 1847 to 1854. He began lecturing on botany as applied to ornament, setting out his ideas in books such as The Art of Decorative Design (1862).  From the 1860s he ran a large and successful studio in London, producing designs for a wide range of media including wallpaper, glass, metalwork, ceramics and textiles. In 1877 Dresser visited Japan as an official representative of the British Government. His design work was heavily influenced by what he saw there.\nHis designs used inexpensive materials and industrial manufacturing techniques to produce functional objects, many of which have a timeless quality that makes them seem modern today. Dresser was one of the most innovative and forward-looking designers of his time.",
