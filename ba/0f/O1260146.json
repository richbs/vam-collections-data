This finely decorated obi, in figured satin silk with richly applied embroidery and gold leaf, was gifted to a member of the Royal Family by the Daughter of the Emperor of Japan in 1960. The piece\u2019s striking pattern and dynamic design represents the stylistic and technical development of mid-twentieth century textile production. By combining lavishly embroidered chrysanthemums, a traditional motif strongly associated to the Imperial Family, together with brightly coloured maple leaves and camellia, this bold design evokes a simple but dazzling effect that reflects the confident spirit of the period. Unlike the other obi in this set, this piece has retained its traditional form as it lacks the pre tied bow. For ease and efficiency modern obi can be purchased with a pre tied bow which can be easily attached to the back of the obi, thereby alleviating the difficulties of tying a complicated knot.",
