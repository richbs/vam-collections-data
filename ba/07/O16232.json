He was of the same generation of sculptors as Desiderio da Settignano and Mino da Fiesole and his stylistic approach resembles that of those sculptors rather then that of his brother.",

The donor was told that refugees had brought it to Alexandria  from Odessa.\n\nHistorical significance: The statue is a characteristic product of the Rossellino workshop, the type and features being closely related to those of the Madonna by Antonio Rossellino in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, and the hair recalling that of the Young Baptist in the National Gallery of Art in Washington.",
