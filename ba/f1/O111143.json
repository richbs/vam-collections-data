It was revived in Europe during the Renaissance, and again in the 18th and 19th centuries. Cameos and intaglios were prized and collected, sometimes as symbols of power and mounted in jewelled settings, sometimes as small objects for private devotion or enjoyment. Pistrucci was born in Italy but worked in England. He became Chief Medallist at the Royal Mint and made the coronation medals for George IV and Queen Victoria. This cameo shows the infant daughter of his friend Dr Archibald Billing. A medical doctor and a gem enthusiast, Billing modelled the wax from which this cameo was taken.",
