There are changes in detail, but they are not so great as might be expected.   The importance of British trade with the West Indies and the southern Staters of the United States of America is shown by the names of a agood many of the tools.   Cotton pruners and matchetts are examples, one of the latter being marked with G.R. and a crown, while anotherhas seven stars, a crescent moon, and a sun stamped on the blade.   As nowadays, axes were made to suit local demands and the whims of workmen.   Of these tools alone there are shown patterns respectively named Kent, Suffolk, Yorkshire, and Scotch, while the following list indicates some only of the trades for which Sheffield catered : wheeler's falling, blocking, ice, ship's ship's carpenter, hedge, coachmaker's, joiner's butcher's and bench.  The geographical description persists in the case of other tools : Edinburgh bricklayers wanted a wide trowel, the pattern labelled \" London \" has rounded sides.   Or take hoes, which were all made with socket eyes welded close to the blade.  There are two \" West India\" sorts with the blade--if the sketch is full size--1\u00be in. wide by 2\u00bc in. deep, whereas on the mainland (Virginia) the dimensions of a plantation hoe were 4\u00bd in.   wide by 3\u00bd in. high.   Other names in this connection are Carolina, Demerara, Barbados, and Brazil.   The Dutch hoe had a curved blade.   No prices are quoted.\"",
