The plaque was made for application on a circular panel, probably the cover of a snuff box. This plaque is painted black in places on the back to give the effect of a cameo and cut from a very thin sheet of ivory.\n\nThe brothers Hess were natives of Bamberg, but were subsequently active in Brussels, and settled in Vienna in about 1780. They were also recorded in London in 1790. They specialised in micro-carving in ivory, producing bracelets, rings and lids for boxes, often depicting landscapes and pastoral scenes, sometimes set against a bright blue background.",
