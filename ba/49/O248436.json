The hinged top is formed by two roughly semi-circular planks, one forming the lid of a semi-circular compartment (on replaced strap hinges, which can only be opened when the table is in its closed position), and the other hinged (modern strap hinges) and supported by a gateleg, and with a nailed batten underneath to act as a stop for the gateleg. The frame has 3 turned legs joined by a straight rear stretcher and two curved stretchers (possibly elm or walnut?), one of which (the right side) is made from two sections of wood scarfed together. The gateleg is turned, with blocks at the joints and with a shaped foot, and has a cut-out to fit snugly with the rear stretcher (which is cut with a corresponding cut-out) when folded away. The compartment is formed by a thin front panel which has been bent into a semi-circle, and which is tenoned (and nailed) at each end into the rear stiles, and nailed onto the front stile. Narrow edge mouldings have been nailed on the front face of this curved panel (one missing 2009). The bottom of the compartment is a single board (of elm?).",

A strongly-framed 'gate' developed to support the folding leaf that swung out from the main frame, now known as a gateleg. This example is small enough for one person to carry from room to room as needed. It includes a compartment under the hinged lid, and when extended provides a small circular table. The curved front section has been made by bending a thin panel into a semi-circle, and jointing the ends into the rear uprights of the table.\n\nOn loan to Montacute House.",
