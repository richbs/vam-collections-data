Maisey and were apparently obtained by him whilst serving at Rangoon during the second Burmese War in 1852.  Extracts from his personal journal in the possession of the vendor refer to treasure seekers rifling the stupas (24/4/52); to the purchases of \"several images and other curiosities from an artillery man\" (28/4/52); to the discovery of images and emblems\" by artillery man\" (28/4/52) and to the despatch of a box of images etc belonging to Maisey.\n\nAlthough these are almost certainly from a deposit in one of the Rangoon stupas, possibly the Shwe Dagon, which Maisey mentions as subject to looting, they resemble deposits found in the Mandalay region.
