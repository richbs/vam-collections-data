They collaborated together to create inventive jewellery, accessories, and by the late 1980s, unusual headwear such as this bowler overlaid with a tracery of silver-plated brass. The conjunction of the silver metal with the traditional City worker's hat creates a stylish variation on an established classic.\n\nAtelier bowler hats, such as this one, were created from laser-etched artwork. Some sheets of metal were left in plain brass, while others were oxidised to give an antique finish.\n\nAtelier worked with many top designers, using their jewellery skills to create decorative shoe clips, heels for stiletto shoes, and even neon-coloured, full-size armour. They designed hats for Diana, Princess of Wales and the pop music group Duran Duran.",
