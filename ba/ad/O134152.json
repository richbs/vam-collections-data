Apprenticed to a heraldic painter in Edinburgh 1806, entered Merchant Navy 1808, Royal Navy 1812, discharged through illness 1814. Worked as scenery painter in London and Edinburgh theatres, painted panoramas and dioramas, as well as easel pictures. Exhibited 135 works at the RA between 1820 and 1867, 22 at the BI 1820-53, and 21 at the SBA 1824-29 (elected Member 1824, President 1829). Subjects almost all marine, river and coastal scenes. Elected to Sketching Society 1829, ARA 1832, RA 1835. Curator of Greenwich Hospital from 1844. Toured the Continent 1830 and 1838-9, and France 1832. Illustrated Heath's 'Picturesque Annuals' (1832, 1833, 1834), published 'Coast Scenery' 1836, and 'Sketches on the Moselle ... ' (1838). Friend of David Roberts RA and Charles Dickens. Died Hampstead, London, 18 May 1867. His son George Clarkson Stanfield was also an artist; his studio sales were at Christie's 8 May 1868 and 23 March 1876. Much admired by Ruskin, his skill at rendering both sea and sky - despite sometimes showing his theatrical interests too clearly - make him, after Turner, the most distinguished marine painter in Britain of the century. \nLIT: \tArt Journal 1857 , pp137-9; Gentleman's Magazine July 1867 (obit); J Dafforne Pictures by Clarkson Stanfield RA nd [1873]; P van der Merwe The Life and Theatrical Career of Clarkson Stanfield Bristol University PhD thesis 1979, and The Spectacular Career of Clarkson Stanfield Tyne and Wear County Council Museums exhibition catalogue 1979 (with bibliography) \n\nIschia and the Castello d'Ischia, near Naples \n507-1882 \nPanel, 31.4 X 60.9 cm (12 ? X 24 ins) Signed and dated 'C Stanfield. RA. 1857' br \nJones Bequest 1882 \nProbably the work exhibited at the RA in 1858 as 'The Castle of Ischia'. The Athenaeum critic found it 'very characteristic of this vigorous painter', while the Art Journal thought it 'has all the best qualities of Mr Stanfield's marine subjects'. \nStanfield was in Naples in December 1838 and visited the island of Ischia, at the north-west entrance to the Bay of Naples. He wrote to his wife Rebecca on 16 January 1839: \nAlas, all communication with the Main was cut off, it blowing a gale wind with a sea running sufficiently strong to prevent any boat attempting the passage. This continued from the 22nd to the 28th. I need hardly tell you, dear Beck, what sort of Christmas Day I had on this, alone in a wretched albergo, bitterly cold, without fire and nothing to eat, at least nothing that I could eat. Exceedingly unwell I turned into bed in sheer despondency at 6 o'clock in the evening ... On the 28th fairly tired out I left Ischia in a large boat with six men to try and make a landing but after getting thoroughly wet I fairly turned tail and put back into Procida (quoted by van der Merwe, p132). \nThe first result of this visit was 'The Castle of Ischia from the Mole', exhibited at the RA in 1841 (9) and engraved for the Art Union in 1844 (present whereabouts unknown, see van der Merwe p132, cat no 221). Several views of Ischia were exhibited at the RA and BI in 1841,1842, 1843 and 1850 as well as the present work; the artist did not visit Italy again. \nVan der Merwe points out that Stanfield's first painting was well-known, quoting from Murray's Handbook of Southern Italy of 1853: 'The Castle ... has been the scene of many remarkable events in the history of Naples ... Its picturesque beauty requires no eulogy from an English author, since Mr Stanfield has made it familiar to his countrymen by one of the most characteristic productions of his matchless pencil'. \nAn etching of Ischia by R Brandard after a drawing by Stanfield is also in the V&A collections (E566-1912). \n?RA 1858 (359) \n\nAthenaeum 8 May 1858, p598; Art Journal 1858, p167; Examiner 1858, p276 \n\n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
