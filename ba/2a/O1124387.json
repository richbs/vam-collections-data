The translucent varieties in particular were seen as a modern improvement on the more traditional sheer fabrics such as chiffon, and certainly more suitable for young children's clothing, in much the same way as the many washable fabrics developed in the 1920s and 30s.\n\nThe dress may well have been produced by an individual working on a small scale and selling privately or through one or two specialist retail outlets, rather than a commercially established firm.",
