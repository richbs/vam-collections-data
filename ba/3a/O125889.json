August</i> has been read <i>Wed (Catalogue of Water-Colour Paintings</i>, 1927, p. 123) but seems certainly to be <i>E.B.</i>  The sketch is placed here since it is more likely to have come from the sketch-book Constable was using in 1817 than from those of the same size in other years.\n\nNote on Nos. 156-160 [298-1888, 278-1888, 819-1888, 822-1888, 611-1888]\n\nNos. 156, 158, 159 and 160 [298-1888, 819-1888, 822-1888, 611-1888]  are evidently from the same sketch-book, used in the summer of 1817, and measuring about 4 \u00bd and 7 3/8 ins. (115 x 186 mm.).  Nos. 179-182 [265-1888, 301-1888, 620-1888, 295-1888] may also come from this book.  No. 157 [278-1888] is provisionally placed here as it agrees in style and measurement with the 1817 sketch-book.  The inscription on No. 156 [298-1888] indicates that he had arrived by 25 July.\nFor a drawing of St. Mary-ad-Murum, Colchester, which comes from a sketch-book of size 4 \u00bd x 7 3/8 ins. (115 x 186 mm.) and may be dated 9 August 1817, see No. 180 [301-1888].  For a drawing of East Bergholt Church, possibly also from the sketch-book of 1817, see No. 179 [265-1888].  For a drawing of Harwich which may have been made on 22 August 1817, see No. 142 [302-1888].",
