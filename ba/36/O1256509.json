Teddy Ruxpin was created by Ken Forsse in 1985. Later versions of the bear used a digital cartridge in place of a cassette. Teddy Ruxpin was the best-selling toy of 1985 and 1986, and was relaunched in 2006. The bear has been produced by various toymakers and this example is a product of the earliest company, Worlds of Wonder. The book and cassette that accompany this toy is the first Teddy Ruxpin story, The Airship.",
