This example imparts service information and through its styling, informs customers of the engraver and retailer's wishes to be viewed as fashion-conscious, educated craftsmen. For the period, this example is stylistically restrained, serving as a plainer adjunct to the florid, promotional aspects of many contemporary music-titles. \n\nIn 1764, Welcker introduced the single-volume score, removing the need for seperate part-books, an innovation rapidly and widely imitated. Welcker's catalogue was bought-up by Robert Bremner in 1779.\n\n'The new modes of retailing indigenous, printed luxury goods to a tutored, fashion-concious market, particularly in London, coupled with a sage recognition of the need to supply the musically and socially ambitious withinspiring material as seen on the Continent, encouraged the production of a lot of high-quality material. This led to a competitive music publishing and printing environment producing in the middle of the eighteenth century, a second generation of entrepeneurs like Peter Welcker (d.1775), Robert Bremner (c.1713-89) and Domenico Corri (b. c.1746).'\nTaken from: Edge, Kevin. <u>The Art of Selling Songs : Graphics for the Music Business, 1690-1990</u>.
