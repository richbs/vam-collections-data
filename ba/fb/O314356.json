The battle between the two derives from the Old Testament. Goliath was the head of the Philistines who were facing the Israelites in the Valley of Elah. For forty days Goliath appears and asks the Israelites to send him a champion to fight with him in a single combat. David is the one who in the end accepts the challenge, but solely equipped with a sling and some stones and a staff - in contrast to Goliath who was wearing armor and shield. David succeeds and cuts Goliath's head off.\nIn Christian tradition this symbolizes the victory of right over wrong or the Church's fight and victory against Satan.",
