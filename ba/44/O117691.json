Dior's 'Bosphore' evening dress of 1956 is short and strapless in midnight-blue velvet with delicate embroidery by R\u00e9b\u00e9, which, on closer inspection, reveals velvet birds' nests with clusters of pearl eggs.\nWilcox, C., ed., <i>The Golden Age of Couture: Paris and London 1947-57</i> (V&A Publications, London: 2007), p.167 and pl.7.11.\nEugenia Niarchos (1926-70) was one of the Livanos sisters, married to the Greek ship owner, Stavros Niarchos.  She was the perfect couture client - beautiful, stylish and exceedingly rich.  Beaton had written to Pope-Hennessy that Mme Stavros Niarchos was 'about the only person who could afford to order one of the incredibly beaded dresses that Dior has designed'.  Beaton did indeed manage to persuade her to donate her Dior dress, which thankfully she had 'never had the heart to throw away', although she added, 'but I'm afraid they ain't too fresh-looking'.  She died on the island of Spetsopoula in May 1970 in mysterious circumstances, and Niarchos then married her sister Athina, later Marchioness of Blandford.  After Eugenia's death, Niarchos honoured her promise to Beton and handed over 19 items, including pieces by Balenciaga, Courreges, Desses, Dior , Roger Vivier and Ungaro - most notably Dior's intricately embroidered 'Bosphore' dress of 1956.  When I visited Beaton's 1971 exhibition as a youngster, I remember being struck by how small she must have been.  The clothes made her sad story seem all the more real.",
