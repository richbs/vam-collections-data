Technical analysis confirms that this fragment comes from the same weaving as two pieces associated with the relics of St Helena, with a s\u0113nmurw facing left in the Musee des Arts Decoratifs, thus making it at least 8th century. It has been argued that early Central Asian silks are distinguished by the use of floss, gummed silk for the paired warp, but by the 7th to 8th century warp groupings of three to four z-twisted threads are found.\n\nHistorical significance: This silk shows symbols related to Sasanian royal imagery, such as the pearled circle and the small crescent roundels.",

No such silks have been found in Iran. Smaller scale polychrome s\u0113nmurw silks have survived in greater numbers than the large scale version (761-1893). Winged horses and winged lions were popular beasts in Sasanian mythology but the most striking was the s\u0113nmurw. Part bird, part beast, the s\u0113nmurw is a creation of Sasanian art, although it was derived from more ancient Babylonian and Assyrian cultures, as well as from the sea-horse of Greek art. When the Arabs conquered Iran they took over the Sasanid workshops and incorporated the existing repertoire of designs into their own silk weavings with little modification. The naturalism of Greek art had already, in the few remaining relics of the Sasanid dynasty, given way to a degree of stylisation which was further extended in Byzantine and, more particularly, Islamic textile arts. It is therefore not surprising to find a Sasanian s\u0113nmurw on an Iranian Islamic silk a century or more later. Three figures (visiting ambassadors from the region south of Uzbekistan) on a painting in Afrasiab, an ancient city near Samarkand, wear costumes with Sasanian motifs, including the s\u0113nmurw. The painting is dated to the late 7th century by a Sogdian inscription (Albaoum, L. I., <u>Zhivolis Afrasiab</u>, Tashkent 1975).\n\nThe correct Middle Persian (Pahlavi) form is s\u0113nmurw. One would expect the final -w to become -v in New Persian, but in fact New Persian uses a different dialect form, s\u012bmur\u03b3 (s\u012bmurgh), so the form *s\u0113nmurv does not actually occur; Professor Nicholas Sims-Williams (29/02/2012)",
