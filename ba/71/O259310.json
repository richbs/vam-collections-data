The most famous cotton-printing factory was propitiously located at Jouy-en-Josas, half way between Paris and Versailles, the main residences of the French court - and the most desired market for these expensive furnishings textiles. \n\nThe scene depicts activities enjoyed by the wealthier classes in 18th-century Europe - the aristocracy and bourgeoisie who usually spent most of their lives in the city or at court and seem to have had a nostalgic view of the countryside as a place of leisure rather than work. Not suprisingly, all figures in the painting are dressed in the most fashionable attire of the 1780s, as they enjoy pursuits as varied as horse-riding and racing, fishing and picnicking.",
