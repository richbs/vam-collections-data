The group self-consciously followed the tradition of pioneering studies into poverty by sociologists and documentary photographers, gathering thousands of photographs and over a hundred hours of interviews. This photograph is from a series made in Belfast by Chris Steele-Perkins during the height of the Troubles. It was taken in the Divis Flats, a housing development on the Falls Road area built between 1968 and 1972 populated mainly by poor Catholics and partially used as a base by the British Army. The complex was the site of frequent violence during the 1970s.",
