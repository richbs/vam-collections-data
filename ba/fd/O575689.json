            "public_access_description": "This design is for a day dress in plum-brown with lilac facings to the draped neckline and a dramatic knee-length drape of fabric bordered with dyed fur hanging from the front of the neckline. It is signed \"Netty\", for Netty Ferro (1897-1942) and someone, probably Roger Worth, has written a comment, \"Netty - Je ne d\u00e9teste pas idee mais avec l'effect de crois quant\" (Netty, I do not hate the idea, but think about the effect). This gives an insight into the working methods of a Paris fashion house at this period, where, even though Madame Ferro was one of the chief designers at the house, her work still had to meet the approval of the Head of Design, Roger Worth, who approved which designs would be made up by the house for that upcoming season. Roger's comment is probably intended to gently suggest that the front drapery might not be thought flattering, and might even suggest maternity wear.\n\nFrom 1935-1952 Roger Worth oversaw fashion design at the Paris house of Worth. Roger was the great-grandson of Charles Frederick Worth (1825-1895), who founded Worth in 1858, and went on to become known as the first haute couture designer. Following his death, Charles was succeeded by his son Jean-Philippe Worth (1856-1925). The house then passed to Jean-Philippe's nephew, Jean-Charles Worth, who retired in 1935 and handed Worth to his nephews Roger and Maurice. The Paris house closed in 1954 following a buy-out by Paquin, who themselves closed two years later.",
