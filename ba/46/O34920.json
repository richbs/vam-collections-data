Carpeaux made preparatory studies when he visited the exiled ex-Emperor at Chislehurst in 1871 and was called by telegram in 1873 to his deathbed to make further drawings. The sculptor's workshop later produced terracotta and plaster versions in various sizes for sale to Bonapartist supporters.\nThis moving and superbly executed portrait was made after the Empire's collapse.
