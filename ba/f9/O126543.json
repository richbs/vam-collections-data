His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nThe Country Wife (1675), a comedy about deceived husbands and unfaithful wives by William Wycherley (1640-1716), provided Messel with one of his first opportunities to design costumes and sets for a \u2018serious\u2019 drama production.   First performed at the Old Vic Theatre, London in 1936, the staging of this play was somewhat controversial, given the immoral subject matter, though the acting and production won critical approval.\n\nMessel's set for the piazza in Covent Garden makes clever use of mathematical perspective to create the illusion of space on a small stage, a technique he learnt from the Bibiena family, Italian eighteenth century stage designers.  Arches are painted on cut cloths in the foreground, and the backcloth is painted with a view of the piazza.",
