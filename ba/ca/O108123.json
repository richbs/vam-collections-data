Vassos started his career as an illustrator of books.  As the market for illustrated books in limited editions declined, Vassos dedicated himself to becoming an industrial designer.  He worked extensively with RCA, the Radio Corporation of America.  Many of his designs were multifunctional, often combining radios and televisions with record players.  \n\nThis phonograph is built into its own carry-case.  The case design, rather like a suitcase would allow easy and safe transportation of the phonograph whereever it was needed.  At that time, of course, the power came from winding a handle and electricity was not necessary.",
