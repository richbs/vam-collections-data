The shape of the seat, and the name of this bar stool, both evoke a famous scene from the 1955 movie 'The Seven Year Itch' in which the wind billowing from a subway grille raised Marilyn Monroe's skirt. Like a piece of fabric caught in the wind, the back of the stool is folded up from the single sheet of polypropylene, covered with felt upholstery, that makes the seat and sides. It is a neat practical solution and visual allusion that gives the stool its personality.",
