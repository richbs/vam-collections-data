ISBN 1851771026\nThe following is the full text of the entry: \n\n\u201c22 Samuel De Wilde (1748-1832) \n\n<i>William Farren as Lord Ogleby in 'The Clandestine Marriage' by George Colman the Elder and David Garrick</i> \n\nLord Ogleby, described in the <i>dramatis personae</i> of the play as 'an old peer, ridiculously aping the graces of youth, but kind-hearted and benevolent, withal', is shown in Act II scene ii of <i>The Clandestine Marriage</i> which is set in the garden of Sterling's country house. Sterling is showing Lord Ogleby his improvements when his younger daughter, Fanny, presents the aged guest with a nosegay. \n\n<i>Lord Ogleby</i>: I'll wear it next my heart, madam! - I see the young creature dotes on me! <i>(Apart)</i> \n\n<i>Miss Sterling</i>: Lord, sister! you've loaded his lordship with a bunch of flowers as big as the cook or the nurse carry to town, on a Monday morning for a beau-pot. - Will your lordship give me leave to present you with this rose and sprig of sweet-briar? \n\n<i>Lord Ogleby</i>: The truest emblems of yourself, madam! all sweetness and poignancy. - A little jealous, poor soul! <i>(Apart)</i> \n\nWilliam Farren's look of utter astonishment suggests that in presenting her rose, Miss Sterling has knocked her younger sister's nosegay from his hand. \n\nDe Wilde's painting celebrates William Farren's first appearance at Covent Garden on 18 September 1818 when he played Lord Og1eby. He was the finest Ogleby since Thomas King and it became one of his best-known roles. He played the part for his farewell benefit in 1851. A watercolour by De Wilde (there are two versions; Garrick Club 214 and National Theatre 56, the latter dated 5 January 1819) shows Farren as Ogleby, full-length, wearing the same cream coat. It is a fanciful creation and as well as expressing the vanity of the character might have reminded audiences of the costume worn by running footmen, a deliciously inappropriate garb. \n\nDe Wilde's picture makes a rather lop-sided composition and when it was engraved by J. Hopwood jnr. in stipple and line, published 1818 by Simpkin & Marshall, it was reduced along the bottom to half way up the left hand and along the right side to a line running vertically from the D in the signature. The head alone appeared, in reverse and surrounded by clouds, in an anonymous lithograph published in December 1833 by W. Soffe as the frontispiece to the Theatrical Orrery No. 5. The publication is not listed in Arnott and Robinson English Theatrical Literature 1559-1900 (1970). The picture was adapted by R. Page in a drawing that was engraved in line by J. Rogers and published on 3 September 1825. Lord Ogleby is shown with Fanny's posy rather than Miss Sterling's rose, he is not wearing a hat and the costume is different. \n\nOil on canvas 29.2 x 24.15 cm \n1818 \nSigned: DeWilde Pinx / 1818 in black oil paint (bottom right)\n\nProvenance: Rev.

Numerous minor splits along tacking edges and tear at bottom right corner. Many raised lines running across paint surface causing some cracking in ground. Pronounced craquelure in face, right shoulder and right arm. Paint very worn in background and around all edges. Cleaned and varnished by F. Haines and Sons, December 1903. \n\nTechnique: Cream ground on tabby weave canvas. The original tacking edges are present. They have a ground but no paint layer, indicating that the picture is its original size despite the oddness of the composition. \n\nD. 35 (Dyce 35) Neg: HF 4538/CT 16102\u201d\n\n\n\nGeoffrey Ashton\n<u>Samuel de Wilde, c.1751-1832: theatre in Georgian and Regency London [and] George James de Wilde, 1804-1871, the life and times of Victorian Northampton : an exhibition at Northampton Central Art Gallery, 4 September to 2 October, 1971</u>, cat. 22",

The painting was bequeathed as part of the Dyce collection of 3347 works of art, including paintings, miniatures, watercolours and prints as well as his library of 14,000 volumes. \n\nReverend Alexander Dyce (1798-1869), literary scholar and art collector, was the son of a major, later lieutenant general in the Madras infantry of the East India Company. Raised by two maternal aunts in Aberdeen following his parent\u2019s departure for India in 1799, Dyce read classics at Exeter College, Oxford. At his father\u2019s insistence he was ordained as an Anglican priest in 1823, having rejected a career in the East India Company. He developed a career in publishing by translating Greek texts. However he is probably best known for his editions of sixteenth and seventeenth century poetry. Dyce collected many rare books covering English, Italian and Classical literature. His collection of paintings and works on paper is very varied.  In his collection of paintings, Dyce indulged his enthusiasm for the theatre, acquiring portraits of leading actors, while his drawings collection focuses on Old Master drawings from European schools. The Dyce bequest was one of the earliest of a collection of fine art given to the museum. It followed the Sheepshanks collection, which was given to the museum two years earlier in 1857. While the Sheepshanks collection was mainly of contemporary Victorian art, Dyce\u2019s collection focused on British eighteenth and early nineteenth art as well as paintings from Italian, Dutch and Flemish Schools. This bequest therefore helped to broaden the collection, which the museum was already beginning to do by purchasing works from British and Continental Schools.\n\nHistorical significance: Samuel Wilde, (1751-1832), portrait painter. He was apprenticed to his godfather, Samuel Haworth in1765to train to be a woodcarver, his father's profession. In 1769 he broke from his seven year apprenticeship to train at the Royal Academy. There he encountered the artist Johann Zoffany (1733-1810), whose theatrical portraits would later become a major influence on his own works. Little is known of de Wilde's early work. His earliest work associated with the theatre is a portrait of the actor William Shuttlewood. However de Wilde's career in theatrical portraiture began in 1791 with the start of the publication of the second issue of the British Theatre by John Bell (1745-1831). Each issue consisted of a play with a vignette and full length portrait of a leading actor of the day as one of the characters from the play. By the end of the eighteenth century de Wilde's career was established as a theatrical portraitist.",
