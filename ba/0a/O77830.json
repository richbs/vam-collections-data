They were used as table decorations during the dessert courses of grand dinners. To judge from sales records, this one probably represents a theatrical figure in Turkish dress.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe Meissen factory in Germany was the first to make porcelain figures of Turks. These were copied by the English porcelain factories and some were also made in Staffordshire salt-glazed stoneware. The Chelsea porcelain factory in London copied both this woman and her male companion from Meissen figures modelled by Johann Joachim Kaendler (1706-1776). Kaendler in turn based his figures on an engraving included in M. de Ferriol's Receuil de cent estampes representant different nations du Levant ('Collection of 100 prints representing different nations of the Levant [Near East]'), published in Paris in 1714. The male companion in the V&A  is the correct model, but is differently painted and was not the original pair to this piece.\n\nTrading\nPairs of men and women in Turkish dress were included in London auctions of Chelsea porcelain held in 1755 and 1756. Others were offered for sale together with figure groups in theatrical dress. Some groups were described as 'theatrical figures in Turkish dress'.",
