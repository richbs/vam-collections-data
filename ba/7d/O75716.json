He also bequeathed a number of his own works to the Museum. This is one of five items in Blue John that Thomas offered for sale to the Museum. Of this piece he said: 'Square Tazzae is very unusual, as this work was always turned. The two specimens I have are the only examples I have seen or heard of. One corner has been repaired.' Thomas dated this and the other pieces offered for sale from his collection to the period 1860-1885. \n\nBlue John is the name given to the purple-blue coloured fluorspar that is only to be found in one area, Treak Cliff near Castleton, Derbyshire, in England. It is a naturally brittle material and not easily worked, though it may be strengthened with the application of resin or hot shellac.",
