The dress is made of machine-made white silk bobbin net which provides a delicate foil for the contrasting textures and colours of the rich embroidery which decorates the hem of a deep flounce stitched to the skirt. The flounce is headed and finished at the hem with blue silk satin; petal-shaped pieces of net, also bound with satin, fall from the heading.\n\nThe same mid-blue satin and a darker blue satin are used to create roses and rose buds which are arranged with other flower heads, made of pale blue cr\u00eape, along the hem of the flounce. The details of the flowers, and their stems, leaves and tendrils are embroidered in chenille and silk. The bodice is similarly decorated with narrow bands of the mid-blue satin and its sleeves are embellished with the embroidered crepe flower heads. The silhouette of the dress, its materials, and its lavish but delicate three-dimensional embroidery were the height of fashion at this period.",
