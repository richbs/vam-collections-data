Although netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated is the katabori (shape carving). This is a three-dimensional carving, such as this one of beanpods. This type of netsuke, which have no surface texture, are deceptively simple. The maker had to have great carving skills to make them appear realistic.\n\nNetsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. Above all they had to have the means of attaching the cord. Most netsuke had a pair of cord holes (himotoshi). Alternatively the netsuke were fitted with a natural opening through which the cord could be attached. Here the maker has used the stalk of one of the beanpods.",
