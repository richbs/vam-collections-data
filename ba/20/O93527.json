The choice of a fukusa appropriate to the occasion was an important part of the gift-giving ritual. The motifs on this gift cover represent the 'Gosekku', the five seasonal festivals. The lobsters indicate the New Year, the peach blossoms represent the festival held on March 3rd, the iris and mugwort that of May 5th, the kemeri ball--used in a court game--and the paper mulberry leaves that of July 7th and the chrysanthemums that of September 9th. The ribbon-like bundle is a noshi, an ornament originally made from strips of dried abalone, which is traditionally tied to goodwill gifts.",
