John Clarke rode with Astley's show in the early 1800s, and in 1825 he started his own circus that toured English fairs. He had three sons - John (who took over the show after his father died), Alfred (who started his own show, the Powell and Clarke Circus, and had a son, John Frederick Clarke, who became one of the greatest equestrians in circus history), and Charles Senior. Charles's health wasn't thought strong enough for circus life, so he was apprenticed to Drury Lane Theatre. However, he returned to work with his brother Alfred's show, married, and had several children, including Charles Junior and Ernie. He created a trapeze act for them, and as The Clarkonians they achieved international fame. By 1910 they were the world's premier flying trapeze act and created many feats now standard in trapeze acts. This 1914 photograph shows Charles in another guise, making use of his versatile talents as a clown, performing in America where this photograph was taken by Oscar De Longe who had a studio in Madison, Wisconsin.",
