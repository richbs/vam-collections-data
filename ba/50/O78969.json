Narrow, vertical strips, often decorated with grotesques, formed pilasters that  were placed at regular intervals between the spaces occupied by larger murals, mirrors, doors or chimney-pieces. \n\nPeople\nThe panel may have been painted by Michelangelo Pergolesi. He was a decorative artist, whose work included pilasters (1767-1768) in the Long Gallery of Syon House, Middlesex,  and a publication entitled Designs for Various Ornaments (1777-1785).\n\nThe decoration may have been painted by for William Douglas, 4th Duke of Queensbury, after he succeeded to the dukedom in 1786.  The Duke of Queensbury was appointed a Lord of the Bedchamber in 1760. He fell from grace after his support for the Prince of Wales's attempts to become Prince Regent during George III's illness of 1788-1789. His house in Piccadilly was known as Queensbury House. It was here that the Duke regularly met supporters of the Prince of Wales and toasted 'the success of the approaching Regency'. \n\nTime\nThe panel is decorated with popular Neo-classical motifs, such as sacrificial altars, husks and medallions. This type of wall decoration became fashionable after 1759 when James 'Athenian' Stuart  created the Painted Room in the Neo-classical style at Spencer House, London. Robert Adam created similar interiors, such as the boudoir of Audley End, Essex, in about 1769.",
