It was established by the Swedish company Rorstrand to enable them to take advantage of lower import duties for Russian markets, but was sold off to a Finnish company by 1916.\n\nIn the 1930s, an Art Department was founded at Arabia under the leadership of artistic director Kurt Ekholm. Though sometimes the artists contributed designs for production pieces, they also created hand-made studio ceramics. These studio ceramics were included in world exhibitions and competitions, boosting the factories' reputations and doing much to foster the international fame of Scandinavian design.\n\nPekka Paikkari joined Arabia in 1983. This bottle and its partner (C.56A-1988) were included in Paikkari's exhibition 'Varjoostuksia' held at the factory's own gallery in 1985.",
