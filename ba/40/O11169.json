Although an exercise piece for the student, both it and the original S\u00e8vres example are in a tradition of heroic portraits of saints and other worthy  exemplars used to embellish churches, schools and universities.\n\nDesign & Designing\nEliza Mills is not known other than for this work.  She was a student at the School of Design in 1853.  Evidently she was set to copy the S\u00e8vres example, which was executed and purchased a year after the close of the 1851 exhibition expressly for inclusion in the Schools of Design's collections in Marlborough House, Pall Mall, to which they were moved in 1852 by Henry Cole.  S\u00e8vres itself introduced workshops for the revival, teaching and manufacture of a number of historic techniques, including enamelling.  The School of Design's collections formed the basis for the South Kensington Museum.  Eliza Mills copied the S\u00e8vres panel only one year after its own making, thus demonstrating exactly the South Kensington Museum's founding mission, that the best of contemporary manufacture should be used to teach students of design.",
