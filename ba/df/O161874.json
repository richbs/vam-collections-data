The object might have had a metaphoric meaning as if the reflected image of the viewer will mirror the ideal beauty and virtue depicted on the frame.\n\nIn the V&A there is a very similar mirror frame attributed by the Sienese artist Neroccio di Bartolomeo de' Landi, made of painted and gilded papier-m\u00e2che (Museum no. 850-1884). Although the latter object is bigger than the maiolica mirror frame the mould  might have been copied from a sculptural prototype made in the workshop of a sculptor or painter.",
