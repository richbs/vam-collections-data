This kind of small-scale, informal asymmetric pattern was considered most appropriate for private apartments such as bedrooms and dressing-rooms, in contrast to the more formal decoration found in rooms used for entertaining guests. Flock wallpaper has powdered wool appplied to areas of the pattern to give a textured effect that resembles cut velvet. In this case it is the black areas of the design that have been flocked. It is very rare to find samples of the same paper surviving in more than one location, but in this instance the same pattern has been found in Suffolk at Christchurch Mansion, Ipswich.",
