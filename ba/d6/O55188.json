Wooden wall lights were introduced in the late 17th century and were common by the mid-18th century. The Rococo style gave free reign to the carver's invention.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThis design incorporates a miller with a bag of flour descending a ladder from the upper floor of the windmill. The two candle branches grow out of trees.  A contemporary pair of girandoles, based on the same design, were supplied to Hagley Park, Worcestershire, and are now in the Philadelphia Museum of Art.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe carving is contemporary to Thomas Johnson's One Hundred and Fifty New Designs, published between 1758 and 1761. The nozzles of the candle branches would originally have been made in metal, so the present wooden nozzles must be later replacements. The surface has been re-gessoed and gilded. Some traces of early gilding on red bole (a reddish-coloured clay used in gilding) are visible. The donkey's coat is very smooth and has subsequently been oil gilded. The old holes for the original fixings to the wall are visible on the back.",
