In this story during the Buddha's life these ascetics travelled to a cave in the Magadha region where the Buddha was meditating in order to ask him to find answers to various problems they could not resolve. The roughly square panel is badly damaged with many of the figures abraded and the top left hand corner has been broken off. The relief has a plain base and two plain fillets at the top, the lower indented one being decorated with a small saw tooth pattern along its upper edge.\n\nThe rectangular relief has the top left hand corner missing.  It has a scene carved between a plain lower plinth and a stepped double fillet decorated with saw-tooth carving at the top.  The sides are without framing.\n      The panel is dominated by the large central seated figure of the Buddha in meditation with his right hand raised in an <i>abhaya</i> <i>mudra</i>, although this hand and his face are now missing. He is seated on a shallow plinth under the branches of a flowering tree The ascetics, of whom some are youthful while others are elderly and bearded, are grouped around him is a variety of poses.  Those in a lower register are either seated or kneeling in supplication (with one figure seated with his head hanging down between his knees).  The middle group, those of which on the left are badly damaged, are shown standing either side of the Buddha. Two figures, shown only from the shoulders upwards, look down over Buddha's shoulders, (the left one of whom it is suggested by Ackermann may represent Vajrapani). Above in the top register only the three figures on the right hand side have survived, shown from their waists upwards. Discounting the two figures behind Buddha's shoulders ( if we assume that they are divine personages), there are fifteen men surrounding the Buddha, which with another three men in the missing top hand corner of what appears to be a symmetrical composition, totals eighteen rather than sixteen ascetics.",
