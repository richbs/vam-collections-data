It was called Musique de Nuit (\u2018Night Music\u2019) by Dior, who gave individual names to all his designs.\n\nIt was donated to the V&A by Baronne Martine de Courcel, wife of the French Ambassador to London (1962-65).  The wives of diplomats played a very important role in promoting couture across the world.  They were photographed at high-society events and interviewed for newspaper articles.  Often, they would be given dresses by the couturiers, who benefited from the publicity.\n\nThis dress was depicted in a photograph taken by Richard Avedon for American Harper\u2019s Bazaar, October 1956.  The image shown here displays the dress in a pose reminiscent of that photograph, created for the 2007 V&A exhibition The Golden Age of Couture: Paris and London 1947-1957.",
