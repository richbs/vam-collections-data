The shape and internal structural veins of the leaf are drawn on a sheet of paper.  The result is then magnified and the lines of the design thickened in preparation for the photoetching process.  The drawing is then transferred as a negative image on to two sheets of acetate.  A 0.25 mm gauge sheet of brass is coated on both sides with a light senstive lacquer and inserted between the two acetate sheets.  This `sandwich' is then exposed to ultra violet light which hardens the exposed areas.  The sheet is then immersed in acid and the unexposed areas are eaten away.  Afterwards the sheet is annealed and shaped into the bowl form and finally powdercoated.  It is the final powdercoating which gives the bowl its ultimate strength.",

            "history_note": "The photo-etching process is carried out by Micrometallis of Birmingham.  The powdercoating is undertaken by Quality Coatings, Loughborough Junction.\n\nArtist's statement: \n\nABOUT LEHTI (vessel for fruit, sweets etc.) by Maria Jauhiainen MA (RCA)material: powdercoated brass.  \n\nSomething extremely fragile and transient in nature has been translated into a durable material and worked into a functional piece for the home environment, still maintaining the essence of a delicate leaf.  The Lehti-vessel is enjoyable to look at and to handle, whether it is in use or not, and it combines materials and processes in a new and innovative way.  At the same time it is a study into nature, materials and processes, driven by curiosity.  Often weight is regarded as an essential quality of metal and associated with its value.  Here the other extreme of the medium is explored, demonstrating its strength and sensitivity.  Using the minimum amount of material, the combinations of pattern and structure in the right proportion, as well as materials and processes, give the piece its strength and an amazing quality of springiness and flexibility.  The same design is available in sterling  silver with a transparent coating. This is a completely new way of using silver.  Apart from the same flexible quality the plastic coating gives the metal, it shows and protects the wonderful white/beige colour of annealed silver otherwise so difficult to preserve.  And one never has to polish or clean the metal.  The piece won the first prize in the Applied Metal Design Category in 2003 Oxo Peugeot Design Awards, which recognize excellence and innovation in ontemporary applied arts.\n\nFuture plans based on this material include lighting, jewelry and more home accessories as well as new patterns.",
