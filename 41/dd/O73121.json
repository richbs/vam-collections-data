Rysbrack's monument was based on a design by the painter, designer and architect William Kent (1685-1748).\n\nDesign & Designing\nRysbrack adapted and improved Kent's design, a fact which was recognised by his contemporary and friend George Vertue, who noted that the monument was 'a noble and Elegant work by Mr Michael Rysbrack. much to his Reputation. tho the design or drawing of it on paper was poor enough, yet for that only Mr Kent is honourd with his name on it (Pictor et Architect inventor). which if it had been deliverd to any other Sculptor besides Rysbrack, he might have been glad to have his name omitted'.\n\nPeople\nRysbrack was one of the leading sculptors active in Britain in the first half of the 18th century. Born in Antwerp, the son of a painter, he arrived in London in 1720 with his brother, also an artist. Rysbrack specialised in portrait busts and funerary monuments, and executed many in Westminster Abbey, often in conjunction with the architect James Gibbs, or as here, William Kent. Rysbrack's deft and sensitive handling of terracotta may well reflect his Flemish training and background.\n\nMaterials & Making\nTerracotta (fired clay) was often used for sculptors' models, although it could also be employed for finished works. This is likely to have been a preliminary model, and may even have formed part of the sculptor's contract.",

Although drawings for English sculpture, including William Kent's design for the monument to Lord Stanhope, were purchased for this reason, most of the three-dimensional models acquired at this date were French or Italian. Models for eighteenth-century English sculpture were acquired only in the 1930s when the Museum was prompted by scholars such as Katherine Esdaile and the donor Dr. W. L. Hildburgh to take serious account of postmedieval English sculpture. As a result, the Newton model was acquired in 1938 and Kent's design for it (fig. 115) in 1946, complementing the companion design for the Stanhope monument bought seventy years earlier. This reassessment of the artistic qualities of English sculpture led to the inclusion of several English models, including the Newton piece, in the V&A's 1946 exhibition, \"Style in Sculpture.\"\nThis terra cotta was made as a preliminary model for the central marble figure on the monument to the scientist Sir Isaac Newton erected in Westminster Abbey in 1730. By his death in 1727 Newton was already included among English \"worthies\" (or celebrated men), and his monument immediately attracted wide attention. Commissioned by John Conduitt (the husband of Newton's niece), the monument was designed by the architect William Kent, and drawings by both Kent and Rysbrack preceded the making of this model. Models such as this were already being collected in the eighteenth century, and in the 1770s some of Rysbrack's models for monuments in Westminster Abbey were advertised as \"ideal for any library or grotto.\"\n\nLit.
