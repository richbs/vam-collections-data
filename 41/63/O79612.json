            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nThis plaque is thought to be the result of early experiments in transferring printed designs onto enamels. The powdery appearance of the print outlines and overpainting point to a process not fully mastered. The subject-matter of the design also indicates a likely date of late 1750 or early 1751. Only a few years later, the technique was to be perfected on enamels, porcelain and tiles at factories in London, Liverpool and the Midlands. Its development was rapid, for factory owners could see the economic advantage of being able to decorate wares much more easily and quickly than was the case with hand-painting.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe plaque commemorates the foundation by Royal Charter of the 'Free British Fishery Society' or British Herring Fishery Company, on 25 October 1750. Frederick, Prince of Wales (who died in 1751), was the society's first governor, followed by George III. A gentleman, perhaps the Prince of Wales, and lady watch three Englishmen pack herring into barrels. Two Dutchmen look dejected at their loss of trade. Above a banner proclaiming 'Success to the British Fishery' is the zodiac sign of Pisces, and below are a crossed paddle and trident. This design is one of a group of stylistically similar overpainted transfer-prints on 1750s Birmingham enamels, all inspired by the work of French painters such as Jean-Antoine Watteau (1684-1721).\n\nPeople\nLouis-Philippe Boitard (active 1733-1763), a freelance book illustrator and engraver from Paris, moved to London in 1735 and was recorded as living in Lambeth Marsh in 1751. He gained notoriety for pirating Hogarth's set of prints The Rake's Progress, reducing it to a single print. His prints were used for Bow and Worcester porcelain as well as Birmingham enamels.\n\nPlace\nIt used to be thought that this plaque was decorated at the Battersea enamel factory (in existence, 1753-1756), but the imperfect transfer of the print, combined with the topicality of the subject in 1750/51 mitigate against this. Transfer-printing was being perfected on Birmingham enamels in the years preceding the commencement of work at Battersea. Birmingham links with Battersea were strong, though, with John Brooks (active about 1730-1756), who claimed to have invented transfer-printing, moving from Birmingham to become a partner of the Battersea concern.",
