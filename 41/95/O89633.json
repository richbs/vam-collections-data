After the war, during which he was involved in military intelligence and as an artist on camouflage, he worked mainly on book illustrations and book jackets for English and American publishers. He also designed a number of film posters for Ealing Studios and the London Film Company, as well as murals for the Festival of Britain.\n\nCapturing the true desires and ambitions of the public has always been an important factor in selling a product and posters provide a chronicle of the changes and developments in urban society. In the 1930s Shell began a poster campaign which tapped the aspirations of the newly mobile public and advertised the delights of the countryside, yet reassured motorists of Shell's fuel presence everywhere. The graphic artists created images of wish fulfilment, and they had an invisible finger on the pulse of the nation.",
