Carter was made a Royal Designer for Industry in 1971 in recognition of his furniture design. However, the 1970s and 1980s were lean years for independent designers in Britain.  \n\nA Design Council report about the design of consumer goods in 1983 included a section about furniture.  The panel, chaired by the designer Dinah Casson, were invited to propose contemporary furniture for the V&A collection and nominated Ronald Carter's Haarlem dining suite, including this chair.  It was made by Peter Miles Furniture Ltd, the firm that made Carter's furniture for the Museum's 'New Restaurant' the following year.",
