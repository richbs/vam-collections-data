            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nPainted tin-glazed earthenware tiles were produced in vast quantities in The Netherlands in the 17th and 18th centuries. This example, however, is exceptional, both in terms of its large size and the quality of its decoration. It was one of a group produced for Mary II (ruled 1688-1694) by Adrianus Kocx's prestigious 'Greek A' factory in Delft. The tile is painted with a design probably by Daniel Marot (1661-1752), a Huguenot (French Protestant) emigr\u00e9.  Panels formed from four tiles were probably used to flank a doorway or fireplace.\n\nPlace\nThe Water Gallery was a Tudor building at Hampton Court near London that had been remodelled in contemporary style by Sir Christopher Wren (1632-1723).  The travel writer Celia Fiennes (1662-1741), who visited it soon after 1694, said that the Queen took great delight in it. The Gallery 'opened into a balcony on to the water and was decked with china and fine pictures'. According to the writer and journalist Daniel Defoe (1660-1731), there was also a 'dairy, with all its conveniences, in which the Queen took great delight'.  At the Water Gallery, Mary indulged her passion for delftware, which was presumably in part displayed in the 'Delft-Ware Closett' named in the building accounts. This tile was among the delftware supplied for Hampton Court, and was probably installed in the dairy or in one of the Queen's closets in the Water Gallery.\n\nSubject Matter and Style\nThe design of the tile combines Classical motifs with Baroque exuberance. The essentially symmetrical structure of the strapwork restrains the more dynamic features such as the curling acanthus leaves and the figures of the drummer and trumpeter. Designs for William III (ruled 1688-1702) and Mary frequently included their initials, and here the 'WM' device is incorporated into the trumpeter's flag.",
