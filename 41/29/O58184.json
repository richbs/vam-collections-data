Both involved creating a pattern of grooves to hold ink in a metal printing plate. The etched lines were made using acid, while the engraved lines were scored by means of a sharp tool called a burin. The grooves were then filled  with ink and the image was transferred onto a blank sheet of paper.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nIn 1438 Henry Chichele, Archbishop of Canterbury co-founded All Souls College at Oxford. Francesco Bartolozzi based this depiction of Chichele on an 18th-century drawing, which in turn recorded a stained glass window at the College.\n\nOwnership & Use\nThis print and its pair (museum no. W.98:1-2-1978) are thought to have originally belonged to the writer and collector Horace Walpole (1717-97) and to have hung in his Gothic-revival house at Strawberry Hill, near Twickenham in Middlesex. The style of the frame, with an inner Gothic arch and stylised flowers in the upper corners, would have fitted in well with the house's decoration. Both  were sold in 1842, when the house contents were auctioned. After this the prints were for some time at Brookhill Hall in Nottinghamshire, before being spotted by a curator in an antique shop near the V&A, when they were bought by the Museum.",
