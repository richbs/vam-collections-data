            "history_note": "Historical significance: Giambattista was one of the most renowned painters of eighteenth-century Italy. He studied in the workshop of Gregorio Lazzarini. However Tiepolo moved away from the classicising style of his master, creating instead works with a focus on tonal qualities in the manner employed by his contemporaries Giambattista Piazzetta and Giovanni Battista Pittoni. This follows in the tradition of the sixteenth-century artist Tiepolo. Tiepolo began his career painting a series of canvases depicting <i>Prophets</i> and <i>Apostles</i> for S Maria dei Derelitti, Venice, in 1715-16. He is documented on the register of the Venetian confraternity of painters in the following year. \n\nBy the 1720's Tiepolo's success at home brought many commissions from outside Venice. Between 1725-6 he worked in Udine, on a scheme of frescoes for the Patriarchal Palace (now the Archbishop's Palace) for the Patricarch Dionsio Dolfin. In 1730-31 Tiepolo worked in Milan producing works including frescoes for five ceilings in the Palazzo Archinto. During the 1740s, Tiepolo was at the height of his fame. He produced paintings indcluding  the <i> Family of Darius before Alexander</i> (1743) and the frescoes of <i>The meeting of Anthony and Cleopatra</i> and <i>The Banquet of Anthony and Cleopatra</i> for the Palazzo Labia, Venice. From 1750-3 Tiepolo worked in W\u00fcrzburg on a commission for frescoes of the ceiling and walls for the Kaisersaal of the Residenz at W\u00fcrzburg. Again in Venice, Tiepolo became the president of the Venetian Academy in 1756. In March, 1762, Tiepolo was summoned by Charles III of Spain (reigned 1759-88) to paint three ceiling frescoes in the Palacio Real, Madrid. He travelled that year with his sons, Giandomenico and Lorenzo, to work on the project. He was to remain in Spain until his death in 1770. Tiepolo's works ranged from frescoes and paintings on canvas of histories, mythologies and religious subjects. As well as these works, which were the result of commissions from patrons, Tiepolo also produced a series of etchings. Tiepolo was an expert printmaker. His output can be seen in the two main groups of etchings that he produced, the <i>Capricci</i>, a group of ten prints, and the 24 <i>Scherzi di fantasia</i>. Stylistically these works probably date to the 1730s or 1740s.\n\nIn his <u>Catalogue of the Tiepolo drawings in the Victoria & Albert Museum</u>, Knox identifies this as an early study for a canvas of <i>Apollo and Marsyas</i> for the Palazzo Sandi-Porto in Venice and now in the Accademia in Venice. It is believed that the artist finished the painting before he left for Udine in 1726 and therefore the drawing can be dated to circa 1725. \n\nThe figures of Apollo and Marsyas occupy the entire space of the composition. They are placed in the foreground to heighten the intensity of the scene as the victor begins to flay Marsyas, who is tied to a tree. On the right side behind the tree two figures look up at the group. The grouping of these two figures probably derives from a sculptural source. The treatment of the figures, using wash to create three dimensional form, can be compared to the drawing of <i>Apollo and Daphne</i> by TIepolo (V&A inventory number: D.1825.75-1885). The drawing is highly finished with wash applied to create light and shade as well as different textures, such as the hair of Marsyas's legs and the polished knife held by Apollo. \n\nThe composition can be seen as being developed by the artist in later compositions including the <i>Sacrifice of Isaac</i>  in the cathedral at Udine (1726), the <i>Martydrom of St Bartholomew</i> in the Capella Colleoni, Bergamo (1733), and the <i>Martyrdom of St Sebastian</i> at Diessen (1739).",
