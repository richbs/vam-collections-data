The person using it stuck a piece of bread onto the fork tines (prongs) and held the bread in front the fire until it was done. When it was not being used, the fork could be hung up by its suspension ring.\n\nBy about 1800, some toasting forks had telescopic handles with some three to four slides so the length could be reduced when the fork was not in use. The silver handles were sometimes engraved with decoration (here an ancanthus motif), the owner\u2019s initials or a dedication from a donor.",
