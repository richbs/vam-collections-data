It was targeted at the newly fashionable sportswear market. This model was available in a range of colours, including the attention-grabbing yellow that Sony went on to use for later sports models.\n\nThe Walkman's casing is made from thick, impact-resistant plastic, with a firm lid-closure mechanism and rubber seals around the openings to make it splash-proof. The buttons are shaped and positioned so that they can be easily used without looking, making it ideal for use on the move.",
