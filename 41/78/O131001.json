Two women in the picture are wearing two-piece dresses of the period, one in maroon and the other white with a black printed pattern. They are having a drink of sherry? before dinner. \n\nThe wooden furniture in the room is in the 1950s style, all in two contrasting woods and veneered. The table is set for four people and has cut glass plates and wine glasses. There are four round backed dining chairs, one against the wall, with brown, red and beige striped upholstered seats. There is also sideboard, on which stands a table lamp with yellow lampshade decorated with a red and white star motif and some pieces of crystal glass. \n\nThe walls are decorated with two different patterned wallpapers, one diamonds and the other checked in blue/grey colour scheme. There are two framed prints on the walls, one abstract and the other a Japanese scene. The French windows have curtains patterned with squares of different colours, or outlined, dotted and striped, in blue, red, pink, mauve and yellow. The carpet is dark blue-grey and in the bottom right corner is part of a dark red rug with abstract African style pattern in black.\n\nOne piece of the jigsaw is missing. This is a right-hand edge-piece, and would show part of the dark blue-grey carpet. The jigsaw comes in an envelope (E.550:1-2005).",
