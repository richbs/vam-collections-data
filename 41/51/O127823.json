Carved on the outer faces of the two outer spurs (at top) with stylised leaf ornament. One of the two plain (built-in) faces with two large mortices (at top and bottom), and two smaller (and evidence of others), and within a long rebate two further mortices, and one original peg. Looking from above the post, an L shaped tenon is visible, sitting within a well formed by the three spurs. At the top, between the spurs are two plain recesses, each with a large, vertical mortice, possibly originally holding applied ornament.\n\nNo traces of colour.",

The Museum purchased it for \u00a350 from Bertram Sergeaunt. A letter from H.B.Marsh (Librarian and Curator of the Public Library, Burton-Upon-Trent), 10/11/1922, was sent to the V&A, noting their unsuccessful attempt to purchase the post at auction, and requesting a photograph of the post, and loan (for six to twelve months, of 'any indefinite period suitable to' the Museum). \n\nCharles Tracy, English Medieval Furniture and Woodwork (London, 1988), cat. no. 239, p.145:\nThe post belonged to a building in the market-place at Burton-on-Trent, called the Garrets, formerly used as residence for the canons of the collegiate church.  On the destruction of the building it was moved to Plas-Newydd in the Isle of Anglesey, and at the sale there about 1850 it was bought by Mr. Robert Thornewill, of Burton Abbey, whose son moved it to Craythorne, near Burton.  It was afterwards lent to the Museum at Burton-on-Trent.  The post was called 'Finney's Post', after a merchant of Burton by name of Finney.  It is related the Finney's wife, who had the reputation for being a scold, fell into a trance; and while her bier was being borne to the graveyard it hit against the post.  She thereupon recovered consciousness and lived, it is stated, for several years afterwards, much to the disappointment of her husband.
