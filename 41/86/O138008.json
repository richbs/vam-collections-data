The complete outfit consisted of a crocheted wool tam (hat); this cotton army surplus jacket and similar shirt; a cotton string vest; cotton trousers; rainbow elastic braces and nubuck deck shoes. It reflected a style of dress worn by UK Rastafarians in the 1970s.\n\nThe Rastafarian movement started in Jamaica in the 1930s. Working-class Jamaicans were inspired by the anti-colonial teachings of Marcus Garvey, who sought an \u2018Africa for the Africans\u2019, and by the coronation of the Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie (Ras Tafari Makonnen). Followers of the movement rejected the trappings of western modernity. They wore clothes made of natural fibres and allowed their hair to form dreadlocks. \n\nThe Streetstyle outfit represented the \u2018classic\u2019 style of Rastafari at the time of its widest influence in Britain. By the 1970s Rastafarianism had become a fundamental force in the lives of many young black men and women in Britain. It encouraged them to draw strength from their African heritage in an often hostile environment.",
