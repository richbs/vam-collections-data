The chair was made in High Wycombe, a centre of traditional furniture making. Lutyens also designed a house for Hudson: Deanery Garden in Berkshire. This large half-timbered house was built between 1899 and 1902. He used the same chair design in another house, Little Thakeham in West Sussex, in 1902.",

Lutyens had this chair made in High Wycombe, a centre of traditional furniture making and used this model in another house, Little Thakeham, also in 1902. Its design is derived from the standard type of eighteenth century ladder-backs made in Lancashire and Cheshire.\n\n[Gareth Williams, 'British Design at Home', p.100]",
