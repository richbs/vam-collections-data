Her crime was to have assassinated Jean-Paul Marat, a powerful journalist and political figure during the early stages of the French Revolution. Marat\u2019s writings and influence helped push the French Revolution in a more extreme direction. His essays and journals attacked those he considered to be enemies of the revolution and Republicanism, and justified the violence of the Terror. Charlotte Corday came from a royalist family and sympathised with the moderate Girondin faction, who had come under harsh attack from Marat. She gained an audience with him under false pretences, posing as an informant, and used the opportunity to stab him in the chest. Charlotte Corday was guillotined shortly after the assassination. At her trial she claimed that she \u201ckilled one man to save a hundred thousand\u201d. Although executed as an enemy of the state this print shows that she was seen as a heroine for many people in both England and France. In this series Idnarpila also engraved an image of the revolutionary politician Robespierre's 1794 execution by guillotine, which ended the reign of Terror.",
