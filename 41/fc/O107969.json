Instead they were attached to a tape and tied around the waist as separate garments. Worn under the hoops and petticoats, they were accessed through openings in the gown and petticoat seams.\nOn this pair of pockets, the embroidery designs on each are similar but not identical, suggesting both were hand-drawn. The motif of flowers growing from pots was a popular one in British embroidery from 1700 to 1750, and can be found on aprons and petticoats. The use of wool in shaded colours evolved from crewel work (wool embroidery) of the late 1600s. This example is very simple in design and possibly the work of an amateur.\nThe pockets may have been handed down to another person who found them too small. Each pocket has been extended at the top by about 4 cms.",
