            "bibliography": "Smailholm Tower was originally built in the 15th century or early 16th century by the Pringle family. Designed, in common with all Scottish peel towers, to provide its occupants with protection from sporadic English raids, the tower was attacked by English soldiers in 1543, 1544 and again in 1546. Smailholm was obtained by the Scotts of Harden around this time. The Scotts \u2013 ancestors of Sir Walter \u2013 rebuilt parts of the tower and barmkin. In the 18th century the tower decayed, following the family's move into nearby Sandyknowe. The last owner, the Earl of Ellesmere, handed the property into state care in 1950. It was restored in the 1980s, and now operates as a museum. Walter Scott was born in Edinburgh in 1771, but as an infant he fell ill, and his parents sent him to Smailholm for the good of his health. He was just 18 months when he arrived at Sandyknowe Farmhouse, the dwelling down in the hollow that replaced Smailholm Tower as the Scotts\u2019 family home. There his grandmother and aunt told him tales of the Border countryside and the Reivers. In his old age, Scott acknowledged the powerful effect these Border ballads had on his imagination, as did the sight of his ancestors\u2019 ancient tower, \u2018standing stark and upright like a warden\u2019. In 1802, Scott published his much acclaimed 'Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border'. Later, shortly before his death in 1831, he paid an emotional visit to Smailholm.",
