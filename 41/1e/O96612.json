            "public_access_description": "Harris Heal commissioned this silver cup in 1900 to commemorate his term of office as Master of the Painter-Stainers\u2019 Company in the City of London. Charles Robert Ashbee (1863-1942) based his design for it on English steeple cups made in the period 1600-1700. These tall standing cups had domed covers with tall finials in the form of three- or four-sided pyramid-shaped \u2018steeples\u2019. \n\nHere you can see how Ashbee has subtly reworked the traditional design. He has made a delicate wirework steeple finial and used the combination of restrained enamelled decoration and semi-precious stones associated with Arts and Crafts silverware. The silver surface has a soft sheen and has been finished with a round-faced planishing hammer. \n\nAshbee regarded the study of the work of 17th-century English and Continental goldsmiths as an essential part of the programme of self-education for members of his Guild of Handicafts. Founded in the East End of London in 1888, the Guild followed the concept of the medieval workshop and promoted traditional handicraft skills that were passed from master to apprentice.\n\nAshbee occasionally went outside the Guild for the execution of his designs. For this piece he chose W. Poyser for reasons that remain unclear.",

The cup and cover (1909-10) by Child & Child of Thurloe Place, South Kensington, in a revived, German Renaissance manner illustrates the prevailing mainstream taste for historicism while the Painter and Stainers\u2019 Cup designed by C.R. Ashbee for Harris Heal (1900-01) is a very contemporary and subtle restatement of a 17th century design and epitomises the essence of the British Arts and Crafts movement.  \n\nBy 1900, Ashbee and his Guild of Handicraft had a achieved a stylistic maturity.  For a while the Guild even showed a modest profit but events were moving swiftly.  In the 1890s the work produced by the Guild struck a fresh and original note.  By the 1900s, Ashbee was to witness others adapting his ideas and extending them further.  The workshops of Henry Wilson, Nelson Dawson and Edward Spencer of the Artificer\u2019s Guild, Omar Ramsden and in Denmark,  Michelsen and Georg Jensen began to produce work that was richer and more self assured than the austere, products of the Guild of Handicraft.  These firms successfully popularised the Arts and Crafts philosophy and occasionally incorporated Art Nouveau tendencies.  The retailer A.L. Liberty of Regent Street with his Cymric range of silver and jewellery was the amongst the most successful and all remained commercially viable long after the demise of the Guild in 1908.\n\n(Graphic panel:  the Silver Galleries)",
