            "public_access_description": "The serving of fashionable hot drinks, namely tea, coffee and chocolate, was often the focal point of  domestic social rituals in the eighteenth-century. Porcelain tea and coffee sets with matching trays (d\u00e9jeuners) were made for small groups, couples or individuals to serve themselves in private  apartments. The design and elaboration of the decoration of the services signalled their owner\u2019s taste  and wealth. This service would have probably have contained two teacups, two coffee cups and two  saucers and a coffee pot, as well as the teapot, hot milk jug and sugar bowl.  The milk jug has a cover as milk was sometimes served hot with both tea and coffee in the 18th century.\n\n\tThe decoration of playful cherubs or putti, symbolic of 'Love', all enamelled in shades of puce,  harks back to an earlier style made popular in the 1750s at the royal French porcelain  factory of Vincennes/S\u00e8vres.  At that time, this type of decoration after engravings by  the artist Fran\u00e7ois Boucher, epitomised the exuberance and sweetness of the rococo  style.  Here, however, the cherubs have been used to decorate pleasingly simple  shapes that are completely in keeping with the new prevailing style of the final quarter  of the 18th century, neo-classicism.\n\n\tThis service demonstrates that styles and fashions changed slowly on the whole and  that while the decoration is somewhat old-fashioned for the 1770s, the factory's  customers could of course commission or buy services with putti  if that is what they liked.\n\n\tSituated in French-speaking Belgium near the French border today, Tournai was part of  the Austrian Netherlands, under Hapsburg rule when the porcelain factory was  established in about 1750.  Ceramics had been made in Tournai for centuries as there  are rich clay deposits in the region.  The manufacture of porcelain however, was only  made possible by the arrival of two brothers, Robert and Gilles Dubois, from France.   They had previously been employed at the Mennecy and Vincennes factories there, and  brought the secrets of porcelain manufacture with them.",
