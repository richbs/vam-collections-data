Potter would  provide Lucie with miniature letters, most often from characters in her tales, addressed to each  other. These could be inserted into the postbox.\n\nBeatrix Potter (1866-1943) is one of the world's best-loved children's authors and illustrators.  She wrote the majority of the twenty-three original Peter Rabbit books between 1901 and  1913. The Tale of Peter Rabbit (Frederick Warne, 1902) is her most famous and best-loved tale.",
