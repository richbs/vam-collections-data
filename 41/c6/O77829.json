Vases of this shape are called \u2018meiping\u2019 in Chinese, meaning 'prunus vase'. Although they were used to hold prunus flowers, they served other functions as well. \u2018Meiping\u2019 vases were made at many different Chinese kilns from the 12th century to the 19th. \n\nThis elegant vase appealed to George Salting (1835-1909), a passionate collector who bequeathed to the Museum a large number of Chinese ceramics. When Salting bought this piece it was already more than 400 years old. The Chinese had always treasured ancient ceramics, but it was only after the opening up of China to the West after 1840 that antique items became available to other collectors. The appearance of these hitherto unknown objects on the British art market inspired artists to create new forms and patterns.",
