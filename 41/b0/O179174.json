English Ceramics Circle, 2013 See no. 45 for this print used on a mug entitled 'The Prussian Hero'. The source painting of King Frederick II of Prussia (1740-1786) by Antoine Pesne (1683-1757) is illustrated fig. 45B. The authors refute the connection to Hancock: 'Cyril Cook in his <u>Life and Work of Robert Hancock</u> attributed this engraving and that of the Prussian Hero No. 2 to Robert Hancock. This seems unlikely as it does not appear to be in his normal style, nor are the accompanying designs.'",
