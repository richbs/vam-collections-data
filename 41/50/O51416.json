Its simple and elegant form, and suitability for mass production, ensured its success. It was one of the first chairs in which a continuous seat and back were formed from a single sheet of plywood, bent into compound curves. The curvaceousness of the chair is both organic and sensual, a characteristic that the photographer Lewis Morley exploited in his portrait of Christine Keeler in 1963. In fact he used an early copy of the chair, one of many lookalikes that have been made over the years. Literally millions of Jacobsen's design have been made in the half century or so it has been in continuous production.",
