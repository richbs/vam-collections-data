There is a pencil sketch verso. The paper has two small holes down the right side, as if originally contained in an album, and has a small circular sticker bottom right with the number137 printed in red lettering.",

This production is set in the carnival atmosphere of a pre-Lenten fair in 19th century St. Petersburg. \n\nThis sketch is part of the Valentine Gross Archive (THM/165), held by the V&A Department of Theatre and Performance. Valentine Gross Archive contains research material and artwork, including sketches, studies, drawings, pastels and illustrations. Only the artwork materials have been catalogued with museum numbers and given item level descriptions found in the Search the Collections webpage. \n\nValentine Gross, a.k.a. Valentine Hugo, was a French art student in Paris in the 1910s. She became a ballet enthusiast, illustrator, researcher and painter. Valentine Gross witnessed annual seasons of Diaghlev Ballets Russes in Paris and made preminary sketches during performances and rehearsals between 1909 and 1914.  She later worked them up into pencil or coloured drawings of various degrees of finish including illustrations and paintings.\n\nSome of the sketches feature in the book Nijinsky on Stage by Richard Buckle, published in London by Studio Vista in 1971. This sketch represents Petrushka in his cell in frustration or in despairin Scene II and features in the book on page 78.",
