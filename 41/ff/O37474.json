            "physical_description": "The toy is of plastic, rectangular with a semicircular handle at the top.  The front surface is white plastic, and the underside is blue and wedge shaped to house the internal circuitry and batteries.\nThe top is shaped to house 10 push buttons, a space bar and a mobile telephone.  The telephone handset is yellow plastic and attached to a fluorescent pink speaker grill in a specially designed socket.  The six buttons on the right are linked in pairs, both as colours and movement - when one or other of the pair is pushed, both move.  Three of these are vehicle shapes, dark pink (police), blue (taxi) and yellow (ambulance).  Their pairs are square buttons bearing a transfer print of the appropriate driver.  When pushed each would make a suitable sound.  The space bar, at the lower centre, is clear dark pink plastic and below its three star shaped panel are 3 light bulbs.  The remaining four buttons are above the space bar.  They are different shapes, colours and numbers - 1 yellow circle, 2 purple heart, 3 green triangle, 4 orange square.\nThe top and underside are screwed together and the battery compartment in the underside is also screwed into place.\n1.  body of the toy\n2.  telephone hand set, which is attached to the body by a plastic cord.\n\n*This is an example of a contemporary commercially produced toy designed for young children and more sophisticated than those for a cot. Fisher Price makes a wide range of such toys and this one is intended to introduce the very young to language and the meaning of everyday sounds, such as that of a fire engine or police siren.",
