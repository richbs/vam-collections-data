The seat-rails of the set are arched at the centre and carved with over-scrolled inverted lambrequins framed by acanthus  leaves. The cabriole legs have similar motifs above the cabuchons at the knees, the decoration continuing down in trellised, shaped narrow panels, terminating in square acanthus leaf pad feet. The settees have tall raked upholstered backs, and outswept scrolled upholstered arms.\nThe set is covered in a material exactly copied from the original upholstery dating from between 1717 and 1723. It embodies two sorts of silver and two sorts of gold thread on a background of salmon pink silk which shows through the rich brocading to form a delicate linear pattern.\nUnder the settees are labels marked 'North Heirlooms' followed by the numbers '26' and '27'. \nInstead of a secondary frame which is underneath the chairs and stools, the settees have struts, shaped at the top and nailed across the corners. Under all the set the walnut  frames have a yellow ochre colour where the gesso shows ungilded. The bolus, which shows through the gilding in places, is a brownish red.",
