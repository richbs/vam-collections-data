Tthe object numbers for the whole group bought from him go upto 780-1888.\n\nHistorical significance: Valentine L\u00e9opold, an independent scholar who is writing a catalogue of the Persian tiles in the Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs in Paris, says (personal communication, July 2008) that this type of tile with a kufic inscription is very rare - the only others she knows of are one in the Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs collection, and one in the Mus\u00e9e de S\u00e8vres.",
