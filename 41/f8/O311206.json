The design of the bell is well balanced and delicately cast, with the putti alternating with winged counterparts. The obvious sources for these figures are those found in the works of the Florentine sculptors Donatello, Luca della Robbia and Bertoldo.\nThere are three similar bells known with the same basic designs, two of which bear the arms of the ruling Medici family of Florence. There are inferior casts in the Bargello, Florence, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York and a sharply chased, gilt version in the Museum f\u00fcr Kunst und Gewerbe, Hamburg. It was at one time thought to be by the sculptor Andrea del Verrocchio (1434/7-1488), who is known to have cast large bells. The helm above the shield indicates that the bell belonged to a king, duke or prince, and a coat of arms, perhaps in silver, may at one time have been fitted to the blank shield. The survival of such closely related bells is unusual.",

Bequeathed by Salting in 1910.\n\nHistorical significance: Dancing putti were basically adapted from classical prototypes showing cavorting erotes. The design of the bell is well balanced and delicately cast, with the putti alternating with winged counterparts. The obvious sources for these figures are those found in the works of the Florentine sculptors Donatello, Luca della Robbia and Bertoldo.\nThere are three similar bells known with the same basic designs, two of which bear the arms of the ruling Medici family of Florence. There are inferior casts in the Bargello, Florence, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York and a sharply chased, gilt version in the Museum f\u00fcr Kunst und Gewerbe, Hamburg. It was at one time thought to be by the sculptor Andrea del Verrocchio (1434/7-1488), who is known to have cast large bells. The helm above the shield indicates that the bell belonged to a king, duke or prince, and a coat of arms, perhaps in silver, may at one time have been fitted to the blank shield. The survival of such closely related bells is unusual.",
