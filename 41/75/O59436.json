The print shows Aurora in the Vision scene and is based on a photograph.  The print came to the Museum as part of the Cyril Beaumont Bequest.\n\nHistorical significance: The Sleeping Beauty is a key production in both the history of the Royal Ballet and in Fonteyn's career.  The mounting of the greatest of the Russian classics in 1939 by an English company not ten years old was presumption in the extreme, but it was possible because Ninette de Valois recognized a potential Aurora in Fonteyn.  She went on to dance the role over fifty times during the War.  In 1946, Sleeping Beauty was the production which re-opened the Royal Opera House and Messel's vision of the ballet has overshadowed almost all subsequent attempts to stage it. \nIn 1949, the Sadler's Wells Ballet opened their first American season with The Sleeping Beauty and Fonteyn's performance in Act I was both her artistic coming of age and that of the Sadler's Wells Ballet - overnight both were catapulted to international superstardom. In 1961 the Royal Ballet took Sleeping Beauty, back to the Maryinsky in St Petersburg, where it had been created in 1890.",
