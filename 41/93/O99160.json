For four<i> corbeilles lozanges</i> from that service, see Christie's, 12th June 1995, lots 389-392.  They were decorated with a turquoise ground, flower sprays and gilded with rose thorn borders, and cost 480 livres each.   The eight different <i>'corbeille'</i> basket-tray shapes in the King's service were all thickly potted and prone to damage in the kiln.  Perhaps for this reason, unlike the other service shapes, they were rarely re-used and are not often found today.  As there is no service listed of this date with this decoration this tray must have been intended as a tray for a tea service, a <i>d\u00e9jeuner corbeille</i>.  As such there would have been tea wares with matching decoration of turquoise ground and trophies.  An expensive item of this type would have been made for a prominent member of the court of an extremely wealthy client of the factory.'\n\nThe detailed composition of the trophy is as follows:\na partly unfurled scroll with a table of geometrical drawings entitled <i>ELEMENS D'EUCL</i>\na book shown open at a page with the title <i>TABLES DES SINUS TANGENTES ET SECANT....</i>\na globe showing Europe and Africa with latitude and longditude marked\na compass hooked on the rim of the globe\ntwo telescopes, one a table version with an elaborate mount\na theodolite (?)",
