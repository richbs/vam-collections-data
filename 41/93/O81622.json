He exhibited at the Salon between 1866 and the first decade of the 20th century. He was a founder-member of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Beaux-Arts in 1890 and was made officer of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur in 1894.\n\nThis painting is typical of Lhermitte's peasant scenes. It shows a scene of everyday life in the market place of a small village in Brittany, Ploudalmezeau.",

According to Lhermitte's diary it was executed in Mont-Saint-P\u00e8re, the artist's native town, after sketches and documents brought back from Brittany in the last two to three years.\nThe artist depicted here figures in traditional dresses with the typical Breton headgear, entirely wrapped around the face, called <i>supellinenn</i> and already at the time considered as archaic. \n\nComparable market scenes include <i>Apple Market, Landerneau, Brittany</i> dated c. 1878, in the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and <i>Market at Ch\u00e2teau-Thierrry</i>, executed in 1879, in the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, Madrid.",

            "historical_context_note": "19th-century French art is marked by a succession of movements based on a more or less close relationship with nature. At the beginning of the century, Romantic artists were fascinated by nature they interpreted as a mirror of the mind. They investigated human nature and personality, the folk culture, the national and ethnic origins, the medieval era, the exotic, the remote, the mysterious and the occult. This movement was heralded in France by such painter as Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix (1798-1863). In its opposition to academic art and its demand for a modern style Realism continued the aims of the Romantics. They assumed that reality could be perceived without distortion or idealization, and sought after a mean to combine the perception of the individual with objectivity. This reaction in French painting against the Grand Manner is well represented by Gustave Courbet (1819-1877) who wrote a 'Manifesto of Realism', entitled <i>Le R\u00e9alisme</i> published in Paris in 1855. These ideas were challenged by the group of the Barbizon painters, who formed a recognizable school from the early 1830s to the 1870s and developed a free, broad and rough technique. They were mainly concerned by landscape painting and the rendering of light. The works of Narcisse Virgile Diaz de la Pe\u00f1a (1807-1876), Jules Dupr\u00e9 (1811-1889), Th\u00e9odore Rousseau (1812-1867), Constant Troyon (1810-1865) and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet (1814-1875) anticipate somehow  the <i>plein-air</i> landscapes of the Impressionists.",
