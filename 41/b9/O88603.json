The geometric modern range were not as popular as the traditional cottages and  houses, therefore were not in production for long. However the decorative detail such as the parquet flooring, and fittings such as the electric bulbs, together with the simple streamlined minimalist look of the time reflects the 'real' home in miniature.",
