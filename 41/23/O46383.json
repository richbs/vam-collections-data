She wears a close fitting cap in dark blue cut in points over the forehead, the edges trimmed in gold, from which rises a headdress shaped like a gold bird, with, to the back, a grey scarf or snood decorated with stylised white flowers covering the hair and hanging down over the right shoulder, and round gold earrings and a gold necklace. On her left hand and lower arm is a red covering ending in a long curved point over the hand and with a small cross and a large elaborate decoration in the form of peacock's feathers attached to the lower arm.  The figure is marked with numbers, possibly indicating colours, and is inscribed with the name of the character. The design is mounted on thick white paper.",
