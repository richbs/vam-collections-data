He is Cai Yongxiang a hero who lost his life saving a train of Red Guards by removing an obstacle from the line. All detailing is in red lacquer. \nThe flat style of the relief is reminiscent of woodblock prints and other graphics of the Cultural Revolution period.(Craig Clunas 17/8/90)",

It was made in Sichuan, a province famous in the 1960s for producing a particular style of woodblock print in the style of romantic Socialist Realism. The image on the dish, in both its subject-matter and the flat style of relief, alludes to this genre, and indicates that it may originally have been produced in graphic form. It depicts the People's Liberation Army fighter, Cai Yongxiang, who was raised to hero status when he lost his life saving a train of Red Guards by removing an obstacle from the track.",
