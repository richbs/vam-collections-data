I, p. 34, no. 4, pl. XV (<i>Unknown Lady</i>); <i>Catalogue of Miniatures</i>, 1908, p. 27, fig. 6 (<i>Unknown Lady</i>); Long 1929, p. 321 (<i>Elizabeth of Bohemia</i>); Long 1930, p. 52; Joan Evans, <i>Pattern in Western Europe 1180-1900</i> (Oxford, 1931), p. 172, repro. no. 238, facing p. 165; <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 42 \n \nIdentification of the sitter as Elizabeth of Bohemia was by Long in undated notes on the file.  Long also began listing other versions of this portrait type, including that at Windsor, (1) Cat. No. 11, and what has subsequently become Cat. No. 12.  Of these, the V&A trio seem to belong together, and to them may be added the example illustrated in Foskett 1979, (2) paired with a <i>Frederick</i>.  They seem to be slightly later in date than the Windsor version, which is dated 1621.  The V&A group therefore seems to be from an independent sitting of perhaps 1623-6, analogous to and contemporary with the numerous versions of the full-scale portrait type attributed to Mierevelt, for example at Welbeck Abbey, in which Elizabeth wears the same rosette jewel with table-cut stone in the centre, low-cut dress and fichu, and has a similar hairstyle.  Facially there is also an impressive similarity with a type attributed to Mytens in the Royal Collection (3) in which she looks the other way and wears a high-cut dress.  The later is dated by Millar to c. 1626/7 and by Kerslake up to c. 1625: (4) dates which help to fix the V&A group similarly in the mid- rather than the early 1620s. \n \nNeither Piper (5) nor Davies (6) discusses the Peter Oliver portraiture of the Bohemians, but Piper makes the important point that Elizabeth seems to have 'broadcast' images of herself in support of her husband's claim to the crown of Bohemia.  From their frequency the miniatures were evidently part of this process, which was clearly well in train by 1621, the first year of exile after Frederick's and Elizabeth's expulsion from Prague in November 1620.  The beautiful locket, in which this miniature is enclosed, was linked by Joan Evans to a design published by Pierre Firens of c.1625.  Michael Snodin (7) also cites sheets of engraved ornament by Balthasar Lemersier of 1626 and by Jacques Caillart of 1629. (8) The locket thus reveals Elizabeth commissioning the most up-to-date goldsmiths' work for these 'diplomatic' gifts of her image to her political friends. \n \n1 Murdoch 1981, fig. 99; Sir Oliver Millar in a personal communication suggests that this may be 'PO Elizabeth Queen of Bohemia in a golden Ovall frame enamelled with black (2 inches); Royal Inventory, Charles II, no. 413. \n2 Foskett 1979, pl. 11F.\n3 Repro.
