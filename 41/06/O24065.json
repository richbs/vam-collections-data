Understated and contemplative, his post have a quite grandeur that has brought him considerable recognition in recent years. Yoshida does not belong to the Japan Crafts Association or any other such organization. Furthermore, unlike most artists working in traditional styles, who tend to focus on a single idiom, he is something of a polymath. As the foremost student of the Arakawa Toyozo (1894-1985), under whom he worked from 1956 to 1968, he is a master of Shino and Black Seto wares. He is also well known for his so-called kohiki wares, stonewares covered in white slip and clear glaze in a style reminiscent of Chos\u00f4n period (1392-1910) Korean ceramics of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. His experiments with Shigaraki clay are a fairly recent development, as is his exploration of burnished earthenware.",
