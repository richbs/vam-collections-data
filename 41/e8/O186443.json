The only stipulation attached by the Academy was that the student recipient send back a sample of his work to each spring exhibition of the Royal Academy. Not long after arriving in Rome, Soane began preparing the annual submission for the exhibition of the following year. He enumerated such sources of inspiration as the Pantheon, the Imperial Baths, and he might have added the colonnades at St Peters, which influenced his own forecourt arrangement. \n\nWith its eclectic references to an ancient and modern Rome, the British Senate House  compares favourably with the visionary schemes of such distinguished Soane predecessors in Italy as Robert Mylne and George Dance. According to Soane his design was criticised at the Royal Academy for insufficient 'practical acquaintance with the accommodation necessary'. The lighting of the bicameral interior foreshadows Soane's later fascination with what he called 'lumi\u00e8re mysterieuse'.",
