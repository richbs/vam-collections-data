Its plain double top has a drawer at either end and is supported on two gatelegs. Although the table top has been altered, the legs are mostly original. The construction of the drawers suggests that the table was made around 1710.\n\nMaterials & Making\nEach half of the top is made of two narrow pieces of elm joined together. As elm boards tend to be wide, the construction indicates that the top has been altered at a later date. The two pieces nearest the hinges have a matching figure, or grain. This suggests that they were once one half of the original top, but have been divided with new sections added on each side. The brass hinges replace original ones of iron. The beading around the drawers is original.  The rotating legs of the gates fit into sockets in the rear stretcher. The bulbs on the legs are jointed not turned. This was not done to avoid  wasting a thick piece of wood by turning it, but to allow the maker to plane the square sections of the legs to the same level.\n\nOwnership & Use\nThe table was owned by Percival Griffiths (1861-1937), who over 40 years assembled  an important collection of British furniture dating from the first half of the 18th century. He was advised by the furniture historian R.W. Symonds, who published an account of the collection in 1929.",
