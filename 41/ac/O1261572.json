The messages  in the  cards are brief but it gives a  small insight into family life.  The telegram message  from Uncle  Ernest reads: 'Up the Reds' as they are a  family of red heads.  \nGreeting cards to celebrate birth were available but usually only sent by close family   members.  The  telegrams by nature are brief; these were mostly used as emergency   communication but also to celebrate  events such as a birth.  There is some advertising   material relating to baby goods, which may have been  given out with the telegrams.  This child was born at the beginning of the Second World War but probably not  at a point that materials were in short supply. \nGreeting cards have existed in many cultures during the past few hundred years but it  was  really in the 1850s  that they gain popularity, as rather than being hand crafted one  off pieces they were mass produced and  cheaply available and the introduction of the  postage stamp  made the postal service more reliable.  They saw another increase in the  manufacture of  cards in the 1930s with the introduction of coloured lithography.\nThis telegram is a special Greetings Telegram introduced by the General post Office in 1936.  The first ones released were for valentines, they were slightly more expensive that a normal telegram but were send on coloured printed forms.  Others were soon realiseded to celebrate other occasions, such as weddings, coming of age etc.  They were introduceded to help boost the Telegram Services that was facing competition from the telephone service.",
