For a similar subject see: P.48-1917. \n\nBy 1892 such works seemed dated to critical commentators; in that year Walter Shaw-Sparrow observed of 1041-1886: 'Of Seiler's highly-wrought panel \"Literary Researches\", what need be said? It is interesting, no doubt...and yet...the interest lies not quite so much in the result as in the intention'; cf. <i>The Magazine of Art </i>, vol. XV, 1892, p. 164 & repr.",

            "historical_context_note": "Carl Wilhelm Anton Seiler (1846-1921) was born at Wiesbaden, he studied architecture at the Bauakademie in Berlin and painting with Karl Raupp in Munich. He lived in Berlin, where he taught at the Academy in 1894-95, and in Munich, where he was a honorary member of the Academy from 1890 and a member from 1895. His works are in a number of German collections, and the National Museum of Wales in Cardiff and the National Gallery in Melbourne, as well as the V&A.\n\nDuring the second half of the nineteenth century the enduring popularity especially of Dutch, Flemish, Spanish and French genre paintings of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries fostered a taste throughout Europe both for realist paintings of everyday life and for more idealised historicising 'costume pieces' representing domestic subjects set in the seventeenth or eighteenth centuries.",
