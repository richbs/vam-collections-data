            "public_access_description": "The Arabia ceramics factory was founded in 1873 near Helsinki. It was established by the Swedish company Rorstrand to enable them to take advantage of lower duties for Russian markets, but was sold off to a Finnish company by 1916.\n\nIn the 1930s, an Art Department was founded at Arabia under the leadership of artistic director Kurt Ekholm. Though sometimes the artists contributed designs for production pieces, they also created hand-made studio ceramics. These studio ceramics were included in world exhibitions and competitions, boosting the factories' reputations and doing much to foster the international fame of Scandinavian design.\n\nBirger Kaipiainen first joined Arabia's Art Department in 1937. This witty bird is typical of his work and was one of his favourite motifs. He crafted larger three-dimensional birds out of ceramic beads, watch faces and wire.",

ISBN 1851770712.\n'This particular long-beaked bird has been a favourite motif for Kaipiainen. He also made several three-dimensional versions during the 1960s known as 'bead-birds' or 'pearl-birds' into some of which he incorporated watch- or clock-faces, another favourite motif. Very similar bird plaques and also two 'pearl-birds' were included in the exhibition 'Finlandia' held in the Museum in 1961.'",
