The term is repeated here in its original historical context\n\nE. W. Mackney was an Englishman who also performed black face in English music halls. He wrote a number of Minstrel related songs. Blackface is a style of theatrical makeup that originated in the United States around 1830 and which was based on racist stereotypes of African Americans. It was most commonly used in the minstrel performance tradition. White performers (and sometimes black) used burnt cork, greasepaint or shoe polish to blacken their skin and exaggerate their lips.",
