Pugin and printed in the 'Repository of Arts' between June 1825 and September 1827. they were then subsequently brought together as a book, 'Pugin's Gothic Furniture', which was published by Ackermann, without a date but probably in 1827. The letter-press in the 'Repository' describing the table states that the griffins on the base are taken from the Palais de Justice at Rouen. A.C. Pugin visited Normandy several times with his students making drawings in preparations for his book, 'Pugin and Le Keux's Specimens of the Architectural Antiquities of Normandy', 1827. The delightful group of medieval illuminated manuscripts which are lying on the table might possibly be a contribution from the young A.W.N. Pugin, then thirteen years old.",
