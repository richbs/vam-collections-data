            "history_note": "This caricature is of the music hall performer Phil Ray (b.1872), performing at the Grand Theatre of Varieties, Hanley during the week of 21 September 1903. Ray was known as 'The Abbreviating Comic' or 'The Abbreviating Patterer' and often wore an Eton collar and a variety of hats with feathers stuck in them.  His pseudonym related to the way he sang songs with abbreviated words such as: 'On Victoria plat/ I patiently sat/ with my little portmant on my knee.' The caricature comes from the first of several albums compiled by the graphic artist George Cooke, featuring performers working in music hall in the early 20th century.  The album is dated 1903-4-5.",
