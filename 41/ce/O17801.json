He later attended lessons at the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture and sojourned in Italy from 1699 to 1706. He specialised in history painting and genre painting with erotically charged scenes, for which he became best known. He was one of the leading painters of the Parisian high society and was nominated, in January 1738, Director of the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise in Rome where he died in 1752.\n\nThis painting is a good example of the gallant pieces fashionable in the 18th-century France. It depicts a secret rendezvous set in a romantic garden by a fountain while a maid interrupts the conservation with a dramatic gesture. This painting is one of the earliest \u2018tableaux de mode\u2019 by de Troy, a genre he is credited to be the inventor.",

He was in Italy from 1699 until 1706, staying in Rome, Florence and Pisa. In 1708 he became a member of the Acad\u00e9mie. He was appointed director of the French Academy in Rome in 1738 and died there in 1752. His works include historical and mythological subjects, portraits, genre scenes and cartoons for tapestries. \n\n342\nTHE ALARM or LA GOUVERNANTE FID\u00c8LE \nSigned and dated indistinctly at the bottom of the fountain <i>J F DE TROY 1723</i> \nCanvas \n27 3/8  x 22 3/4 (69.5 x 63.8) \nJones Bequest \n518-1882 \n\nOriginally attributed to Watteau (<i>Handbook</i>, 1884) on account of a spurious signature, this painting was restored to De Troy when the true signature and date were discovered before 1893 (1893 <i>Catalogue</i>, p. 187). \nA similar pair of lovers appears in two interiors by De Troy in the Wrightsman collection, New York: <i>The Garter</i>  (dated 1724) and the <i>Declaration of Love</i>  (each 25 X 20 \u00be in.; both exh. Salon 1725; <i>France in the 18th century</i>, R. A., 1968, nos. 669-70, repr.). A comparable exterior, also exhibited at the Salon of 1725 is the <i>Game of 'Pied de Boeuf'</i>  formerly in the Seligman collection, Paris (Dimier, 1930, pl. I), and there are others in the Hermitage, Leningrad, at Chantilly and at Charlottenburg (exh. <i>La peinture fran\u00e7aise du l8e si\u00e8cle \u00e0 la cour de Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric II</i>, Paris, Louvre, 1963, no. 5, repr.), 518-1882 belongs to this group of early 'tableaux de modes', among which are some of De Troys most attractive works. \nA copy (oil on canvas, 16 X 11 \u00bd  in.) was in the Lamm Sales at New York (American Art Association, 21-4 Feb. 1923, lot 564) and Stockholm (24-5 Sep. 1923, lot 202). A water-colour copy, probably of the 19th century, is in the royal collection at Windsor (A. Blunt, <i>French drawings at Windsor Castle</i>, 1945, p. 58, no. 317). 518-1882 was engraved by C. N. Cochin (1688-1754) (reversed; repr. in <i>Historisch-Interessante Bildnisse und Trachten aus dem K. Kupferstich-Cabinet in M\u00fcnchen</i>, 1886-89, pl. 173) under the title <i>La Gouvernante fid\u00e8le</i>, with a verse appended: \n\n'Fuyez Iris, fuyez: ce s\u00e9iour est \u00e0 craindre. \nTandis que de ces eaux vous cherchez la fra\u00eecheur, \nDes discours d'un amant d\u00e9ffendez v\u00f4tre coeur, \nlls allument un feu difficile \u00e0 s'eteindre' \n\nProv.

The Regency was marked by a relaxation in social behaviour, partly engendered by the profligacy of the Regent himself and partly a reaction against the constraints of the later years of Louis XIV. An erotic element appeared in much contemporary art and whilst this canvas is in no sense scandalous it clearly provided a mild element of titillation to the original spectator with its implication of sexual intrigue. Verses which appear on an engraved version of this subject - such engravings being very popular - makes it clear that the faithful <i>gouvernante</i> is not in fact warning of the approach of a father or jealous lover but rather of the dangers inherent in too receptive a response to the young man's protestations of love.\n\nDe Troy achieved eminence as a painter of genre, mythological, historical and religious subjects, as a portraitist and as a designer of tapestries. He became an <i>acad\u00e9micien</i> in 1708 and died in Rome as director of the French Academy there. It was for his lighthearted so-called <i>tableaux de modes</i> - suggested by the earlier success of Watteau - that he became most celebrated in his lifetime. These canvases were painted specifically to illustrate the costumes and manners of an increasingly frivolous society and, apart from their intrinsic merits, now constitute splendid records of the age. An early biographer comments that De Troy was himself something of a fribble and much in favour with 'respectable but tenderhearted ladies of the Paris bourgeoisie'. He undoubtedly painted his elegant scenes of contemporary life for a new clientele, many of his patrons being newly prosperous bankers and financiers. It is recorded that he painted no less than thirty-two overdoors for one such client! \n\nThe new elegance, lightness, fluidity of line and freshness of colour exemplified in De Troy's work met with a ready and enthusiastic response in a society reacting against staidness and formality in public behaviour. \n\nHarold Barkley\"\n<u>Handbook to the Jones Collection</u>, 1884, p. 139 f.\nC.

            "history_note": "Bequeathed by John Jones, 1882\n\nHistorical significance: Originally attributed to Watteau, this painting has been restored to de Troy's authorship before 1893. It is a good example of the erotically charged genre scenes for which de Troy became best known. It shows two lovers at a fountain, interrupted by a maid. They wear typical 18th-century costume and are depicted in a romantic garden. The gesture of the lady in white with one hand on the fountain grotesque's mask echoes the gesture of the sculpted nymph above and alludes to her secret rendezvous. \nThis compositional idea is reminiscent of the art of Watteau who developed the genre of the 'f\u00eate galante' at the beginning of the 18th century. Although Watteau's 'f\u00eate galante' was pervaded with mystery and a sense of timeless feast, de Troy presents a more authentic portrayal of contemporary manners, fashions and pastimes, hence the appellation 'tableaux de modes', whose invention he has been credited with. The presence of nature plays an important role in these pictures and contributes in developing a formula repeated with success by many artists until the French Revolution.\nThese gallant pieces intersect with the taste for a new sensuality, developed later in the century in the libertine philosophy and exemplified in such texts as <i>Dangerous Acquaintances</i> by Choderlos de Laclos and the Marquis de Sade's <i>Philosophy in the Bedroom</i>.\nThis painting is traditionally dated 1723 (inscribed at the bottom of the fountain) but the composition was engraved in reverse by Charles-Nicolas Cochin p\u00e8re about ten years later and bears an inscription reading: 1727. This painting is anyhow one of the earliest 'tableaux de mode' executed by de Troy and one of the most attractive. The print is accompanied by a few verse in French, which converts this piece into a moralising picture with a warning against the consequences of concealed love:\n'Fuyez Iris, fuyez: ce s\u00e9jour est \u00e0 craindre. \nTandis que de ces eaux vous cherchez la fra\u00eecheur, \nDes discours d'un amant d\u00e9ffendez v\u00f4tre coeur, \nlls allument un feu difficile \u00e0 s'eteindre'.",

            "historical_context_note": "Pastoral is a genre of painting whose subject is the idealized life of shepherds and shepherdesses set in an ideally beautiful and idyllic landscape. These scenes are reminiscent of the Arcadia, the Antique Golden Age that the Roman author Virgil (1St BC) described in the <i>Eclogues</i> and were at the time illustrated on the Roman wall paintings. The pastoral was reborn during the Renaissance, especially in Venice, in the oeuvre of such painters as Titian (ca. 1488-1576) and Giorgione (1477-1510), and gradually evolved over the centuries. In the 17th century, Arcadian themes were illustrated in the Roman school led by the painter Claude Lorrain (1604-1682) whereas a century later, Antoine Watteau (1684-1721) and his followers forged the new genre of <i>f\u00eates galantes</i>, which appears as a derivation of the pastoral. The pastoral became the hallmark of the Rococo movement in which Fran\u00e7ois Boucher's (1703-1770) elegant eroticism found his true expression. This tradition, which had become an illustration of the carefree aristocratic world, died with the French revolution and was never revived although the celebration of the timeless Mediterranean world in the oeuvre of such painter as Henri Matisse (1869-1954) may be seen as a continuing interest for the theme.",
