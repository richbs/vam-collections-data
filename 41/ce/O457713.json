The first section, presumably for the back of the chair shows a stylised representation of a state umbrella and below in each corner is a balustrade, rocks and bamboo. Cloud bands separate this from the next section, presumably for the back of the seat.\n\nThis section contains a fronted four-clawed dragon pursuing a jewel above the rocks and sea. The dragon is worked chiefly in gold thread. More cloud bands with bats separate this from the next section, presumably the seat.\n\nThis pattern consists of a central roundel motif composed of floral forms and butterflies. This is surrounded by clouds and bats. In each of the four corners is a geometrical meander pattern with a dragon head. This section is again divided from the fourth and last by cloud bands and bats.\n\nThis section probably hung down from the chair. On this a pagoda on a rock rises from the sea and waves. On either side of the pagoda are larger <i>shishi</i>. Below in the waves are dragons with fishes tails.\n\nThe whole cover is surrounded by a narrow border with a small floral pattern.\n\nDiaper with a satin of 5 ground and pattern effects in 2/1 twill with coloured silks, silvered paper strips and gold thread (gilded skin wound Z-wise on a silk core). The proportion is 5 ground warp threads to 1 binder.",
