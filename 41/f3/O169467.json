            "physical_description": "Plain weave cotton, probably hand woven, embroidered with silk in straight stitches including satin stitch, and pulled thread work; whitework; faced with printed cotton, possibly resist- and roller printed.\nThis was originally a ruband or face veil with the openwork section falling in front of the eyes.  It may later have been used as a cover.\nThe ground is white cotton and the embroidery is designed in two sections with a common composite border except for the top border which is more elaborate. It is formed of: A] along the top a symmetrical flowering plant alternating with another plant form composed of triangles.  Both repeat motifs show considerable variation. Along the other 3 sides a simple isolated flowering plant motif is repeated. \nB] along the 3 sides [not on the top] a pulled thread band of hexagonal shapes again with some variation.\nC] a band of lozenges each with an 8-pointed central star; the remaining outer [triangular] space covered with a 'basket-weave' pattern in satin stitch and with smaller triangles.\nSection 1: delineated by a line of small 8-pointed stars and edged by a narrow zigzag stripe in satin stitch; followed by a line of pulled thread work hexagons forming a rectangular panel which has a central pulled thread area hexagonal in form measuring 13 x 15.5 cm [eye section] surrounded by zigzags in satin stitch, triangles forming squares and lozenges and 'basket-weave' areas.\nSection 2: below Section1; delineated by a line of hexagons, misaligned at the top left.  A small 'basket-weave' square edged with pulled thread lozenges forms each of the four corner units of this square section [39.5 40 cm] leading into a band around the 4 sides of the square decorated with simple stylized flowering plants showing considerable variation.  These plant motifs , but smaller in scale, fill the central space pointing inwards to a small central square edged in pulled thread work, leading into a frame of angular satin stitch lines possibly forming the word 'Ali' repeated, which frames a small hexagon of pulled thread. There are bands of needleweaving within this design.\nCotton thread: Z-spun\nEmbroidery Thread: white silk; 2S\nFacing: white plain weave cotton ground printed with a pattern of serrated leaves in blue and black which form a broken octagonal grid with an infill of blossoms in white, pink, red, purple and blue.  Incomplete pattern.",
