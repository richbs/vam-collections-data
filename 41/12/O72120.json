The plate is then immersed in acid, which bites the lines into the metal itself. The soft look that etched lines have, which is used to atmospheric effect here, is caused by the uneven action of the acid on the metal. Samuel Palmer (1805-1881) was a key figure of English Romantic painting and printmaking. He belonged to a group of artists who called themselves the 'Ancients', and who held 'poetry and sentiment' to be their watchwords.",

PALMER \n\nGenerally, this exhibition shows very clearly how, in Palmer\u2019s work, most careful analysis went hand in hand with most imaginative designing. If, in etching, he had tapped the great resources of his analytical knowledge and draughtsmanship, now and then (as for instance the magnificent and very ancient tree trunks of Lullingstone Park), I am inclined to think that he might have done etched work as much to Ruskin\u2019s satisfaction as the tree-drawing which Ruskin eulogises in <i>Modern Painters</i>. \nWith the public verdict of seventy-four years (although I have not seen a tenth part of it), I feel content, and more than content. It has been kindly to a very high degree, even when written by those whose sympathies were almost entirely with etching of a totally different school. It has been, so far as I know, unanimous both in the press and privately. Maybe, that some day Mr. Rossetti\u2019s prophecy will be fulfilled \u2013 namely, that the realistic side of Palmer\u2019s art \u201con which he touches the many,\u201d will cause his work to grow in influence. \nOne of the objects of this exhibition was to demonstrate that the purely realistic and analytical side of that art was, from the very first, closely allied with the purely imaginative \u2013 that he continually turned from one to the other \u2013 thus vindicating Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s words: \u201cIt will be found that the ingenious are always fanciful and the truly imaginative never otherwise than analytic.\u201d \nIn all Palmer\u2019s art-teaching, or in the examples he made for his pupils\u2019 use, there was not one attempt to inoculate them with those artistic ideals by which, if his name goes down to posterity, he will be known. But there was a ceaseless effort to emphasize the importance of that universally unpopular pair, \u201cElements and Accuracy.\u201d \nAlthough my father once wrote that the destruction of an etched plate seemed to him like \u201cthe murder of a mind,\u201d I have followed the best advice in Europe most generously given at the cost of much time and trouble, and all the plates in my possession have been finally cancelled by one of the usual methods. This is a fate far more merciful than that they should have been ultimately sold and condemned to the lingering death and dishonour which has befallen plates by illustrious hands. \nThree eminent artists and etchers have, out of regard for Samuel Palmer\u2019s work and memory, done that memory the honour to attend to the plates\u2019 obsequies. They have done this even to printing some of the final impressions with their own hands. In the whole of my father\u2019s life there was no such incident as this. The devotion of the \u201cAncients\u201d to each other was as nothing to it. For brevity\u2019s sake I gave to the three artists the name of \u201cThe Trio.\u201d When any future collector sees the little equilateral triangle which symbolizes the three etchers (and also their initials F. S., F. L. G. and M.H.,) on the margin of an etching by their fellow craftsman, he will know that of all the kindly things which have been written and done in connection with Samuel Palmer and his work, none approaches theirs.\n\n[\u2026] \n\nADDITIONAL NOTES. \n\n<i>General Note on the Etchings</i>. \u2013 Although some of the best impressions of his etchings were sold or given away by Samuel Palmer, nearly all those which I have contributed to this Exhibition were, for various reasons, among his especial treasures. They also represent many days of intense agony and \u201cgrated consciousness\u201d by the side of the inanimate and animate machines which he had to deal with. Of the various states I myself know little. For that knowledge \u201cThe Trio\u201d must be consulted. \u2013 A.H.P.'\n<u>Catalogue of an Exhibition of Drawings, Etchings & Woodcuts by Samuel Palmer and other Disciples of William Blake October 20 - December 31, 1926</u>.

Publication No. 178 E.I.D. pp.83-84.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows: \n\n'THE LONELY TOWER \n\nCatalogue, nos. 217-220 \n\nIn the order of publication, the second plate of the series which was not to be, was <i>The Lonely Tower</i>. There were fourteen bitings and the same elaborate stopping out. On the whole, the first proof satisfied the etcher, but justified re-biting. The re-biting ground having proved unreliable, a second was laid, and, after biting, a proof was taken which is now in the exhibition. (See No. 218. [an object loaned for the exhibition by A. H. Palmer, Esq.]) It is the only one I know of. \n\nThis plate having been promised to the Etching Club, appeared as an abominable parody of the sample proof in the work published in 1880. Of the result Palmer wrote: \"So the dear old Etching Club revives on the 15th. I love it though it has quite smashed me by the way my <i>Lonely Tower</i> has been printed. Full directions were sent to the printer, and a model proof, but in vain.\" This printer was not Goulding, but a gentleman of such august presence, and (in his own eyes) such unapproachable skill, that apparently, he was above sample proofs. He evolved his own atrocities in his own way. So he murdered <i>The Lonely Tower</i>. \n\nOf this plate it appears that I took a good many proofs in progress, each distinguished by some letter or otherwise, and each recording a distinct state. But no notes were kept of them, because, with the exception of a few well-marked differences, my father was not interested in the states of his plates. \n\nThe first designs for <i>The Bellman</i> and <i>The Lonely Tower</i> were in sepia, and one of them is in the exhibition. (See No. 154 [E.1319-1925]) Finished replicas were made in water-colours and were formerly in the possession of Miss Augusta Smith, of Tunbridge Wells.'",
