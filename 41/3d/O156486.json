            "public_access_description": "The panels of this box are set with burgau shell, coral, ivory, mother of pearl and gold, a technique known as laque-burgaut\u00e9. Burgau shell comes from the green sea snail (turbo marmoreus). It became very popular in the 1800s and 1900s in Europe for jewellery, fans, buttons and instrument inlay due to its clear, creamy colour and iridescence. However, the main fishing grounds became depleted and it is now little used. The technique originated in China during the Ming dynasty (1368-1644), where it was also used to cover unglazed porcelain and was also widely used in Japan in the Tokugawa period (1603-1867). \n\nIt was made by the goldsmith Gabriel-Raoul Morel, the goldsmith responsible for the box, was born in Paris in 1764. He first entered his mark in 1797, under the French Revolutionary government and is noted for the range of media in which he worked. Morel is known to have specialised in remounting old panels in new boxes. It is therefore possible that the panels in this box were made some 75 years earlier.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world\u2019s great decorative art collections, including silver,  mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
