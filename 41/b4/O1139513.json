Here the act of making is as much the subject as the matter depicted.\n \nHer prints (which are often based on her own architectural models of urban spaces) explore the relationship between the natural environment and urban/industrial architecture. Her use of etching complements her subject matter; scratchy marks and scuffs - some deliberate, some accidental - mirror the weathered and abraded surfaces of the buildings which inspired the original imagery. Her use of colour is both subtle and unexpected in the context. This print - Baker Street - is printed with dark grey and a vibrant pink, which varies in intensity across the surface where she has wiped away more or less ink.",
