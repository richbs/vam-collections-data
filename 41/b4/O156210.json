            "physical_description": "Short jacket of plain weave silk embroidered with couched silk chenille thread, with spangles, lined with plain weave glazed resist and block printed cotton, faced with woven wool.\nThere is a V-shaped opening at the front; elbow length sleeves with open underarm gussets.  The jacket is shaped over the hips and the facing acts as a binding over both seams except for the lower 5 cm which is open. Light blue-green silk pieced many times, especially at the back.  This silk is heavily embroidered with alternate large botehs and vertical curving leaves arranged in offset rows.  The embroidery is in chenille in 3 shades of green, 3 blues, white, beige, 2 shades of brown, red, pink, purple and grey, but green predominates.  Both motifs are further embellished with round metal spangles, some of which were originally coloured eg. red, green and blue.  Underdrawing in black ink is clearly visible in places.\nLining: pieced; white ground with an overall dense multi-branched meander with a black stem with various small flowerheads, blossoms and buds in red, purple and blue with small green leaves.\nFacing: pieced; bias cut striped wool. The exact pattern is unclear.  The colours are white, red, dark blue, pink and yellow with either a dense meander in another colour or a small floral motif.",
