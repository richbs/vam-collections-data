The photographs from this series, published in the book Actual Life are a sensitive record of life in this southern English county at the in the early years of the new millenium, across a range of people and subjects. This photograph shows a trio of young men \u2013 or teenagers \u2013 standing outside a church. The psychologist and writer Adam Phillips has written that \u2018one of the many striking things about Glanville\u2019s portraits of people \u2013 apart, that is, from their unstartled stillness \u2013 is that his subjects are revealed but never exposed. His photographs seem to give people a sense of themselves, without exploiting their self-consciousness in front of the camera\u2019.",
