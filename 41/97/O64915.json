The centre front of the yoke is embroidered with a pink rose and bud, with a narrow line of faggotting and a spray of shamrock at each side; the back yoke is plain.  The skirt, which is gathered to the yoke at front and back, has a hem with a serpentine upper edge, scalloped and worked with pale blue thread in buttonhole stitch.  National emblems of the UK are worked in coloured silks above the hem at the front: a central rose with a sequence of leek, thistle, leek and shamrock on each side; among the emblems on bodice and skirt are scattered motifs of the typical four-petalled flower found on children's garments with Madeira embroidery of this type, with french knots and small sprays of foliage.  The garment fastens at the back of the yoke with two pearlised buttons and stitched buttonholes.",
