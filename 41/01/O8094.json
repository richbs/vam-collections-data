Sets of three, five, seven or even nine vases were known as 'suites of vases' in the 18th and early 19th centuries. They were commonly set out on mantelpieces, with the largest one in the middle. This vase is unusually elongated.\n\nDesign & Designing\nBoth the colour range and the painted pattern itself were inspired by a type of Japanese porcelain known today as 'Kakiemon', after Sakaida Kakiemon (1596-1666), a Japanese porcelain maker whose decoration was widely copied in Europe in the 18th century. The bulk of the Kakiemon wares (which were made for export) that found their way to Britain were made before 1700. They were highly prized in mid-18th century Britain, when they were often described as 'Old Japan'. The Bow factory papers include several references to 'Japan' patterns or wares.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe Bow factory made a type of porcelain that was strengthened with bone ash. It concentrated on the production of utilitarian wares, but also made a large number of figures and ornamental wares, including vases. The factory was very large, employing about 300 people around 1760 and calling in receipts of \u00a311,555 in 1755.",
