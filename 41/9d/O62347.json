They had no religious function but gave some support to the monks and clergy in the long parts of the services when standing was required. This explains the name 'misericord', which comes from the Latin for mercy. The decoration was often amusing and sometimes moral.\n\nThe Museum acquired this misericord, and 17 others, in England. But they are very similar to others made for the church of St Peter's, Louvain, in the Southern Netherlands (now Belgium). They could have been removed from the church in the early 1800s, during the upheavals of the French Revolution.",
