It is artist Marf's take on the current news story. As she describes it: 'A star rises over London Fashion Week, heralded by the heir to Yves Saint Laurent, and much to the excitement of the London fashion world, he\u2019s British. His name is Giles Deacon. Even the cattiest critics at Prada praise his workmanship and sheer talent, and his debut could not be sexier or more glamorous \u2013 the supermodel Eva Herzigova volunteers to model his bloomers, and nothing else.'\n\n'Marf' drew daily topical cartoons for the Evening Standard between March 2002 and August 2005, moving to the Londoner's Diary page in August 2003. The drawings cover key political and social issues of the period, providing a vivid and often hilarious response to the main news of the day. The Evening Standard is London's only evening newspaper, publishing up to five editions a day. In Marf's own words: 'The cartoonist needs to keep up with the rapid pace of event.'",
