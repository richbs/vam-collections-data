            "public_access_description": "There was a great effort of academic scholarship in the cathedral schools of the twelfth century to provide a commentary on the Bible. From about 1130, the whole of the Bible had a gloss; Gilbert de la Por\u00e9e (ca.1080-1154) further revised the gloss for the Psalms and the Epistles of St Paul. Copies of his gloss have the page layout found in leaves at the V&A, with the gloss written out continuously and the biblical text in a larger script put at the appropriate place alongside. This arrangement seems rather clumsy when compared to the alternate-line layout that characterized glossed books produced in Paris, but it was consistently followed for Gilbert's text throughout Europe. \n\nGilbert had a dramatic career. He was Chancellor of the Cathedral Chapter at Chartres from 1126, but was in Paris from ca 1140 before being elected Bishop of Poitiers in western France in 1142. Before the establishment of the university in Paris at the end of the twelfth century, study and teaching centred on outstanding scholars based in cathedral schools - Laon, Chartres and Paris among others - where books were produced to record their teaching. After ca1160 Paris came to predominate as a centre of teaching and book production, but before this date books were produced in cathedral towns: their design and decoration established the standard for the text in question. It has been argued that the books produced in the circle of Gilbert in Chartres were copied in all their aspects when this scholar migrated to Paris (this has been difficult to prove since the library at Chartres was totally destroyed in 1944), so that the first Paris copies were in fact imitations of Chartres books and their illumination.\n\nWhen Gilbert went to Poitiers in 1142, however, his works were copied in books that were decorated in local styles. The V&A leaves are among these. The designs of the initials are of a kind found in manuscripts produced at this time in such centres as Limoges, Angoul\u00eame and Moissac. The neat interlace of the initial, and even the colour scheme with a bright green and rich red are in a totally different idiom from Paris works of this date. The style indicates a date in the mid-twelfth century or shortly after, which suggests that it represents textual tradition supervised by Gilbert himself.",

Unlike the encyclopaedic historic collections of the British Museum or the Bodleian Library, it aimed to provide examples of medieval illumination and book ornament for students to copy. As with other kinds of artifact collected by the Museum, there was a tension between documenting stylistic traditions and acquiring works of artistic excellence.\n\nFrom the beginning, the Museum tended to buy ready-made collections. A portfolio of cuttings from an Italian choirbook was bought from J.& W. Boone in 1866, a similar collection of more variegated material from Goldschmidt in 1872 and a very large number of leaves and cuttings from the scholar W.H. James Weale in 1883. At the same time, a number of complete medieval illuminated manuscripts began to join the Library's collections.\n\nData taken from notes compiled by Rowan Watson.

Its successful diffusion throughout much of early medieval Europe was closely linked to an increase in intellectual activity based on the dissemination of texts, partly due to the emperor Charlemagne's promotion of scholarship and education. Heightened royal, noble and ecclesiastical patronage of book production from the late-eighth century onwards, and the adoption of Caroline miniscule by the religious foundations and ecclesiastical institutions which were largely responsible for book production at this time, were also key factors in the success of this script. \n\nDiffusion: most of Western Europe from eighth century until eleventh to thirteenth depending on the region. \n\nTaken from Brown, Michelle P. <u>A Guide to Western Historical Scripts from Antiquity to 1600</u>.
