In the plaque on the left is a seated figure of Faith holding cross and chalice.  She sits beneath a broad 'C' scroll and on a platform supported by an urn.  The central plaque, which is hinged to the plaque on the left, has a seated figure of Hope with an anchor.  The central plaque has a hasp (now broken) to attach it to a plaque on the right which has a seated figure of Charity with two children and is otherwise similar to the plaque containing Faith. The gilding has largely been off both back and front of the buckle.  There are two loops for attaching a belt on the back of the buckle.",

The Victoria and Albert Museum acquired the painting in 2003  (E.1062-2003). The buckle looks golden in the portrait, and there are still traces of gilding on the buckle, but much of it has worn off over the years.  \n\nThe buckle is composed of three plaques of openwork foliage and strapwork around figures of the three Theological Virtues: Faith, with cross and chalice, Hope, with an anchor, and Charity, with two children.  The buckle may be converted from an old Dutch book clasp.  Clasps were imported from the mid 1870s by retailers such as Walter Thornhill of 144, New Bond Street, London.  It is of a design which appears within a few years to have been copied by late 19th century manufacturers.  Almost identical silver buckles were illustrated in trade catalogues issued by Mappin & Webb Ltd (1900) and Saunders & Shepherd Ltd (1903\u20134).",
