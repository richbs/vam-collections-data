Snuff-taking was popular with both men and women in Europe from the late 17th century. Small portable boxes such as this allowed individuals to be sure they always had snuff to hand wherever they were. On social occasions larger containers would be passed around the table after dinner. \n\nEarly snuff boxes contained a grater for breaking down the blocks of compressed powdered snuff, which was mixed with spices such as cloves and cinnamon, imported from the West Indies. By 1730, however, the availability of ready-grated snuff made graters redundant. Some boxes contained compartments for two or more sorts of snuff.",
