At the same time it symbolises one of the 12 months of the year.\n\nThere is another roundel with the same subject in Brussels. Although this is of lesser quality, it still retains its border inscription. Translated, this reads, 'At the age of 36 one has to work for profits, as we typify the month [of June]'. \n\nOriginally, therefore, the roundel in the V&A must have belonged to a series of 12, marking each of the months and illustrating the Ages of Man at six-yearly intervals from the ages of 6 to 72. Like the Brussels roundels, it must once have had a border inscription. The relevant Sign of the Zodiac was probably added to it.",
