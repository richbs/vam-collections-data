It might also have formed part of the carved decorations surrounding a picture. It was once owned by Sir Charles Allom (1865 - 1947), a highly successful decorator of the first decades of the 20th century, who specialized in creating 18th century revival interiors for clients ranging from Queen Mary to American industrialists like Henry Frick. This object and other fine examples of 17th and 18th century woodcarving were presented to this museum in 1921 by Allom in memory of his son, Cedric, who was killed in action in 1917.",
