            "public_access_description": "The Weiss K\u00f6nig (White King) was one of three books commissioned by Emperor Maximilian I (1459-1519). The book chronicles Maximilian\u2019s life and represents his court as an ideal chivalric society. Maximilian is unusual in adopting the woodcut as the medium for large-scale schemes of patronage. Woodcut was cheap and therefore less prestigious than painting or tapestry, but Maximilian was short of money and woodcut also had an advantage of allowing multiple copies to be made for distribution around members of his court.\n\nThe Weiss K\u00f6nig linked Maximilian to prophecies foretelling the coming of a Friedenskaiser (Emperor of Peace). In this image, the young Emperor is hunting deer with his courtiers when a messenger hands him a document containing news of a victory.\n\nThe Weiss K\u00f6nig remained unfinished at Maximilian's death but proofs survive. There were 236 illustrations planned, with painter Hans Burgkmair, Maximilian's chief designer from 1508, designing about half of them. The blocks were cut by Jost de Negker and a team of assistants between 1514 and 1516. Large-scale projects like these helped to raise the status of blockcutters. Documents survive showing that Jost de Negker was effectively publisher in overall charge and his assistants were paid an annual salary which worked out six times more for each block that that paid to the designers for each drawing.",
