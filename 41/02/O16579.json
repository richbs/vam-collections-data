Nicholas Hilliard first trained as a goldsmith and introduced to this watercolour art innovative techniques for painting gold and jewels.  In this miniature we see his characteristic curling and scrolling calligraphy, painted in real gold and then burnished.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThis work beautifully illustrates the role of the miniature in the chivalrous atmosphere of dalliance and intrigue at the court of Elizabeth I, where secret gestures of allegiance could become public display depending on the whim of the wearer.  Here the young man turns a picture box, the image concealed, towards his heart. This was a gesture of devotion, presumably made to the wearer of his miniature.\n\nOwnership & Use\nUnlike large-scale oil paintings, which were painted to be displayed in public rooms, miniatures were usually painted to be worn, to be held, and to be owned by one specific owner.  Although we do not know who this miniature was painted for, it is a very intimate image as the gentleman is depicted effectively in a state of undress.",

Full Citation:\n\n\u201cISAAC OLIVER\n\n<b>163 Unknown Man</b>, c. 1600\n\n<i>Victoria & Albert Museum (P.5-1917)</i>\nVellum stuck to a playing card with one inverted heart at the reverse, oval, 66 x 51.5 mm, 2 19/32 x 2 1/32 in.\n\nThe miniature was acquired by Oliver, reattributed to Hilliard by Carl Winter in 1941 (V&A Archives) and finally accepted as by Oliver by both Reynolds and Auerbach.  A detailed examination confirmed, on technical and stylistic grounds, that this indeed was by Oliver.  The techniques which in particular mark it as his work are the stippling used in delineating the features and the naturalistic modelling of the folds of the shirt which is quite unlike Hilliard\u2019s impressionist, graphic manner.  The chiaroscuro and the adventurous iconography also place it decisively as Oliver\u2019s work.\n\nAs in the case of many of Oliver\u2019s miniatures it is difficult to date but the cut of the hair and moustache is identical to that in two portrait by Gheeraerts dated 1599 (Strong, <i>The English Icon</i>, pp. 278 (264), 280 (269).  I would favour as a date c. 1600.  The iconography is of the flames of love and the sitter holds in his right hand what is probably a picture box at the end of a chain.  He has placed himself amidst flames in an emblematic manner that draws on common devices; the phoenix arising out of the flames, used a device signifying the varieties of resurrection, rebirth and chastity.  The general drift of possible meanings is caught in the verse accompanying a salamander emblem in George White\u2019s  <i>A Collection of Emblems</i> (1638), p. 30.\n\nThis <i>Crowned Salamander</i> in the Fire,\nMay therefore, not unfitly, signifie\nThose, who in <i>Fiery Chariots</i>, doe aspire\n<i>Elijah-like</i>, to <i>Immortality</i>:\nOr those <i>Heroicke-spirits</i>, who unharm\u2019d\nHave through the Fires of <i>Troubles</i>, and <i>Affliction</i>,\n(With <i>Vertue</i>, and with <i>Innocence</i> arm\u2019d)\nWalkt onward, in the Path-way of Perfection.\n\nThe formula is repeated in a miniature by Oliver at Hame House (no. 171).  Vaenius <i>Amorum Emblemata</i> (1608) which includes a salamander amidst the flames in a specifically amatory context:\n\nLove live In the fyre\nUnhu\u2019rt amidds the fyer the Salamander lives\nThe lover in the fyre of love delight doth take\nWhere lover therby to live his nouriture doth make\nWhat others doth destroy lyf to the lovers gives.\n\nOr there is equally a parallel to the device of the flaming inverted torch with the motto <i>Qui me alit extinquit</i> (That which feeds me extinguishes me)\n\nEven as the waxe doth feede, and quenche the flame,\nSo, love gives life; and love, dispaire doth give\u2026\n(Geoffrey Whitney, <i>A choice of Emblemes and Other Devises</i>, Leiden, 1586, p. 183)\n\nOnce the sitter had adopted the device it became his <i>impresa</i> open to his own personal reading of its meaning.\n\nThe condition of the miniature is good apart from minor flaking and the silver paint being oxidized.\n\nCOLLECTIONS: W.C.
