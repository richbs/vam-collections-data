A country house in Witley, Surrey, 'The Hill' was built for the artist Myles Birket Foster in the early 1860s and the interiors were originally decorated and furnished, as one of their first commissions, by Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co.\n\nThe album illustrates surviving examples of this commission, including examples of stained glass designed by Edward Burne-Jones.  Tiles and stained glass suppled by MMF&Co. for 'The Hill' are now in the Ceramics and Glass collection of the V&amp;A.\n\nThe album also includes views of other houses in Witley, a village recorded in rural views by Birket Foster and other artists, including Helen Allingham.  Other famous residents included Sir Henry Cole, the first Director of the V&amp;A.\n\nDomestic commissions by MMF&amp;Co., particularly those from the early years of the firm, are not well documented.  This album shows their work in its original domestic context.",
