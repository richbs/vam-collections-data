Compare the locket with that on Cat. No. 147 [Evans 45]. \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> From the collection of Miss M Davies of Black heath (no. 54), from whom bought by private treaty with funds from the R H Stephenson Bequest, 1955. \n\n<b>Literature:</b> <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981 , p.51 . \n\nThe attribution to Rosse accompanied the miniature when it was offered to the Museum for purchase. From the wording of a written description by the vendor, and from the fact that a photograph already existed in the Museum's records, it is probable that the attribution was originally by Long, who would also have recognised the source of the image. It is a copy of the head and shoulders from the seated threequarter-length portrait of the Duchess, accompanied by a black page, by Pierre Mignard. (1) The portrait is signed and dated Paris 1682. Rosse' s copy, in this small format, must date from very soon after. \n\nPiper (2) and, subsequently, Davies (3) summarise the iconography of the Duchess: after types by Lely and Gascars of the 1670s, the main images of her before her return to France in 1688 are this by Mignard and at least three by Kneller. There is no mention of this copy by Rosse, but numerous other images, both in large and in miniature, (4) are presumably dismissed by Piper thus: 'A number of portraits of unknown ladies of the period are wrongly called the Duchess of Portsmouth.\u2019 \n\nLouise de Keroualle (popularly referred to in England as 'Madam Carwell') came to England in 1670 in the suite of the King's sister HenriettaAnne (see Cooper, Cat. No. 84), Duchess of Orleans and promoter of the infamous Treaty of Dover (1670). She naturally became Charles's mistress, was the mother of Charles, Duke of Richmond (b.29 July 1672, created Duke 9 August 1675), and was herself created Baroness Petersfield, Countess of Fareham and Duchess of Portsmouth (19 August 1673) . After Charles's death she retired to her estates in France, having been endowed by Louis XIV with the hereditary Stuart seigneury of Aubigny and created Duchess of Aubigny (January 1684), with a remainder of the estate and title to her son by Charles II.\n \n1 NPG, no. 497; repro.
