He worked as an ambulance driver during the First World War but was invalided out in 1916 and suffered a nervous breakdown in 1918, the year this print was made. Mezzotint at that time was hardly in use by any artist. It is a form of engraving capable of giving a range of tones, from rich velvety black to white; these can be worked into very subtle gradations. Nevinson used the technique to great effect in this image, where sharp diagonals are combined with blurred edges, evoking grime, smog and claustrophobia. Two other mezzotints made about the same time are equally dark in mood.",
