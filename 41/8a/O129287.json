In a statement made in 1988 he described how printmaking was a seminal activity for him, significantly affecting his development as an artist and particularly influencing the way he continued to draw.  \n\nSandle was born in the Isle of Man and, after a period of working in the USA and Canada, where the image of Mickey Mouse became a kind of metaphor for American military aggression in his work, he has spent much of his professional life in Germany at the Academy of Art at Karlsruhe. His work addresses the brutality of war, and his representation of weaponry and machinery has been influenced by the early 20th-century Italian Futurist artists. Much of his work has a memorial theme, looking back to various periods of intense international and global conflict.\n\nThis piece is not dated but appears to be an early work, probably made after studying a suit of  Japanese armour at the Victoria and Albert Museum (Musem no. M.130-1914). \u2018Doi\u2019 was the familial name of the feudal rulers in a particular region of Japan, for whom the V&A suit of armour was made in 1799.",
