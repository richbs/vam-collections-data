Purdon Clarke had been sent to buy Indian art manufactures for the Museum, to increase the scope of its collection and to provide authenticated products from a particular locality This was to serve the dual purpose of inspiring art students and manufacturers with examples of good industrial artifacts, and to allow importers to know where they could buy specific items in India. Judging from this piece and others bought at the same time, the quality of Purnea 'bidri' had declined considerably by the 1880s.",
