For five years he concentrated on photographing Southam Street in London's Notting Dale, the district in which Colin MacInnes\u2019s contemporary novel Absolute Beginners was set. Mayne has subsequently worked in a variety of genres, producing intimate family portraits and dramatic landscapes. He has said of his photographs that \"the two qualities that are really decisive are austerity and tension...for me tension is not only the very life blood of art, but also that which can make art uncomfortable and disturbing.\"",
