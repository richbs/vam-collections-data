Critics often dismissed such pictures as intellectually undemanding, yet some of the most important artists of the day took up the subject. The emotion of these pictures centre on a new, 19th -century conception of childhood as an innocent, separate state to be shielded and prolonged. They seek a protective, affectionate pang from the viewer and evoke nostalgia for the inevitably fleeting nature of childhood.\n\nThis boy charms the viewer with his round pink face and incongruously serious expression and stance. The title points to the idea of childhood as a symbol of promise for the future. The delicate brush work and glowing colouring contribute to the rosiness of the image",
