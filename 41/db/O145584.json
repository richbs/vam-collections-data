The four corners have each a triangular pattern of pulled thread work repeating that of the large octagon.\nA border, edged with a repeat of the 'frame' is patterned with diagonal stripes of two pulled thread variations and one of stain stitch arranged in composite lozenge forms - these converge in the centre of each side.  The two cut edges are turned and hemmed.\nThe cotton thread is Z-spun.\nThe white silk is 2S.",
