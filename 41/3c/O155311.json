The inner and outer borders also have a green meander with pale golden carnations.  It is possible to see the underdrawing in dark ink.  The borders are unquilted.\nThe main area has a lobed roundel in the centre  formed by a green band with golden spots with a central rosette within an 8-pointed green star which links 4 whole flowers and 4 flowers in profile. Each flower has a pair of serrated leaves and a trefoil growing from its top. There are 8 small trees attached to the outer part of the roundel, each has a pair of birds and between these trees is a vase of flowers.\nEach corner contains a small part reminiscent of the central roundel, plus a pair of birds.\nEach half of the field contains 5 floral sprigs, bending to right and facing the centre.  The ground has been quilted with white silk into a diamond shaped lattice.\nNote: There is a distinct purple tint to some of the pale golden silk - but this seems to be on the surface only and cannot be seen on the back.\n\nThreads: dark green, green, white, faded red/purple now a golden colour.",
