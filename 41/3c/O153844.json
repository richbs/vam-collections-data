Over the head is a heron-like bird. Between these stars are rectangles with triangular points projecting from each side, containing 2 fish and floral stems on either a light blue or a faded pink ground.  In the centre is a small circle also containing fish and floral ornaments.  The rest of the field is decorated with floral sprays on a black ground.  There is a narrow border with a repeating design of cypresses and animals [deer?].\nIn the corner with the Museum Number, the design continues but with a change in the field with a different shade of red which may be the product of a different type of dye.\nThe pattern in the border seems slightly truncated along the edges and it may have been cut.\nFacing: bias-cut faded blue satin.\nBacking: light blue satin.\nEmbroidery Thread: 2S silk; black, pink, red, light and dark blue, cream, light brown, shades of yellow.",
