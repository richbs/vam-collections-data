Louis XV recognised the factory's importance in 1783 when he named it a Royal Manufactory. \n\nOberkampf began using the copper-plate printing process in 1770 and roller printing in 1797. The length of the repeat of the pattern was restricted by the size of the plate or the circumference of the roller. The pattern repeat on this print is accordingly short. The neoclassical motifs are typical of fashions of the last two decades of the 18th and the first decade of the 19th century. Pattern designers took their imagery from classical sculpture, bas-reliefs, and vases. Many of these motifs had come to light as a result of archaeological excavations at Herculaneum and Pompeii in the mid 18th century. Medallions, swags, festoons, mythological beasts and trophies of war were frequently used. In the first decade of the 19th century, the last emphasised the military might of Napoleon's army and empire.",
