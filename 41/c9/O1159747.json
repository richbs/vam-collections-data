However Merrythought toys first began in 1919 when W.G.Holmes went into partnership with G.H Laxton, producing a mohair yarn for the toys in a small spinning mill. Some of the employees for Merrythought were previously employed by Chad Valley. \n\nFlorence Atwood was an employee who was hearing impaired and mute. She produced the entire range of toys for the first Merrythought line in 1931. She became the chief designer for Merrythought until her death in 1949. The company still operates from its factory in Ironbridge, Shropshire.\n\nThis particular monkey is called 'Gran'pop'. It is based on Lawson Wood's comical monkeys and were produced by Merrythought from 1932 to 1965. The last Lawson Wood design made by Merrythought was 'Mother Monkey', who was produced in 1965.",
