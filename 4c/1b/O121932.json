From the turn of the century he travelled around Europe, living in Berlin, Brussels, Paris and Jersey.

Besides their documentary value, his photographs have a quirky and almost surreal quality. \nLeisure time is the main theme of Andrew Pitcairn-Knowles' work.

Leisure time emerged in the late nineteenth century in the industrialized West, which resulted in new forms of leisure activities. Pitcairn-Knowles was particularly interested in big organised festivities and events such as competitions like dog racing, horse racing, fairs, the derby, markets and the carnival.
