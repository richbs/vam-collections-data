Inspired by the flowing lines of natural forms Kelly uses delicate plant motifs inlaid with gold. The curved handle completes the elegantly natural proportions. Although the detailing is luxuriant in its romantic, swirling style it is contained within  clearly delineated borders, tempering its exuberance. The subtle ridge running through the blade becomes more pronounced in the handle casting one half of the slice in shadow enhancing the depth of the chasing. The sharpness of ridge is beautifully offset by the round endpiece.",

The artist was motivated to create a freer more personal design, evocative of his childhood memories, particularly his mother's baking. Kelly reveals his connection with the Arts and Crafts Movement through his eschewing of highly polished surfaces in favour of visible hammer marks, high-lighting the relationship  between design and manufacture.",
