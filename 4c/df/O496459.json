The combination of white inlay under a grey-green glaze is reminiscent in particular of Korean celadon ceramics of the Koryo period (918\u20131392). \n\nThe clouds and cranes motif is particularly associated with Korean inlaid celadon. While Koryo potters used a combination of black and white inlaid materials to create their designs, on this (Japanese) piece only the outlines of the birds are inlaid, their bodies being painted in slip with detailing in underglaze blue.\n\nThe vase was made at the Yatsushiro kilns situated in Kumamoto Prefecture on the western island of Kyushu. This area has a long history of contact with the Korean peninsular. During Hideyoshi's invasions of Korea in 1592 and 1597, Korean potters were brought to Kyushu, where they helped to develop the local ceramic industry.",
