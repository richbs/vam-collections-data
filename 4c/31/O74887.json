Inscribed on either side of the head \u2018Ano Dm 1590/Aetatis Suae 27\u2019, the sitter is thus identified as being 27 years old in the year 1590, which therefore discounts the erroneous identification on the later frame as a portrait of the essayist and statesman Sir Francis Bacon. Although the sitter remains unidentified, the miniature is still a striking example of a portrait drawn from life. By the use of a strong light cast on the man\u2019s face from the front left, Oliver is able to manipulate shadow to create a more dramatic effect than is to be seen in Hilliard\u2019s work of the same period.",

The use of shadow by means of the strong light cast from the front left is already highly developed, totally different from Hilliard\u2019s technique during the same period and vividly reflecting the influence of Netherlandish art and the engraved portraits of Goltzius.  This is accentuated by the cast shadow in the background, giving a three dimensional <i>chiaroscuro</i> effect which the lettering, very much in Hilliard\u2019s vein with flourishes to the A\u2019s, denies.  The edge of the miniature has been trimmed, thus losing most of the gold line; in addition there are a number of small damages in the background and minute paint losses to the costume.  The erroneous identification of on the later frame as Francis Bacon can be discounted.\n\nINSCRIBED: On either side of the head: <i>Ano Dni 1590 / AEtatis Suae 27.</i>\n\nCOLLECTIONS: Presented by Mrs Samuel S.
