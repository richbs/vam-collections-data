London: The Victoria and Albert Museum in association with Hurtwood Press, 1983.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n\"<i>Baron de Meyer   German, worked England and USA   1868-1946\nTamara Karsavina  (1885-1978)   About 1908\nAutochrome\n89 X 119 mm   Mus. no. 1234-1980   Purchase</i>\n\nThe Lumi\u00e8re brothers announced the Autochrome process in 1904 but it was not marketed until 1907.  Although not the first process for true colour photography, it was the first to be widely and commercially available.  It was based on a method of coating a glass plate with microscopic grains of potato starch dyed red, green, and blue.  This produced a random pattern of dots on the plate, which was then coated with a gelatin-silver emulsion.  This was exposed in the camera through the coloured mosaic: in good light for at least a second, often more.  A reversal development process followed to produce a positive rather than a negative image and the result was a rather dense but usually accurate coloured transparency.  The individual grains were microscopically small, but the random distribution tended to produce clumps of grains the same colour, giving a coarser structure which could be visible to the naked eye - hence the 'Pointilliste' effect in some Autochromes.  The Lumi\u00e8re Autochrome plates remained on the market until the 1930s.\nThe process was enthusiastically taken up by avant-garde photographers, notably Edward Steichen who used its late-Impressionist 'look' to record La Belle Epoque in sumptuous style.  Baron de Meyer used the process for a very short period, perhaps only in 1907-09.  In 1908 he writes to Alfred Stieglitz declaring that he is so taken with Autochrome that black and white no longer satisfies him - but a year later abandons it in favour of black and white (in which medium he was a master printer).  De Meyer and his wife were much associated with the ballet.  This is one of four Autochromes taken for the Marchioness of Ripon, who first brought the Diaghilev Ballet to London in 1911, in the garden of Coombe, her house in Surrey (where Karsavina and Nijinsky danced for Queen Alexandra).  De Meyer left London for New York in 1914 and became not merely a staff photographer for American <i>Vogue</i> but its first star photographer.\"",
