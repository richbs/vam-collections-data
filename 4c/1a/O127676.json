In the 1735 series of eight engravings entitled A Rake\u2019s Progress he documents the decline of young Tom Rakewell, heir to a fortune which, in plate one, is shown to be largely derived from \u2018India bonds\u2019, referring to East or West Indies trade. Over the course of the series we see the young aristocrat fall from grace, to become \u2013 in plate eight \u2013 an inmate of Bedlam.\n\nIn this scene, plate three, Hogarth follows two previous pictures of fashionable 'high society' with an image of its seedy underbelly. Rakewell is shown amongst a riotous group of pleasure-seekers enjoying all-night entertainment in a private room. Very drunk, he appears oblivious to the fact that the woman seducing him is also stealing his watch. A black woman in the background is an amused spectator to the chaotic scene. Her presence underlines the \u2018savagery\u2019 \u2013 a quality then associated by Europeans with black Africans \u2013 of \u2018civilised\u2019 English society.",

They were Hogarth's second series of \u2018modern moral subjects\u2019 and were painted soon after the publication of \u2018A Harlot's Progress\u2019 in 1732. The subscription for the prints after them began in late 1733, but Hogarth delayed publication until 25 June 1735, the day the Engravers' Copyright Act became law. Even so, pirated copies had already appeared by that time. The set cost two guineas, but Hogarth had also a smaller and cheaper set, copied by Thomas Bakewell and costing 2s 6d, published soon after. The original copperplates were sold by Quaritch in 1921 and are now in a private collection. Louis G\u00e9rard Scotin (1690-after 1755) is thought to have assisted Hogarth with the engravings.'",
