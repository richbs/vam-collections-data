However; the horse's stance is different each side-right (offside) front leg is raised and rear leg is straight while on the left (nearside) front leg is straight and rear leg is raised. Tail is only shown on offside. Glued to the horse is the rider; probably a Hussar. The figure has a simply carved front and a flat back and is turned slightly to the right. A N Varganov is a well known and internationally known maker of these toys. His work is represented in other museums in the USA; Australia; Japan and Germany. He comes from a traditional craft family making these types of toys; both wooden and papier mach\u00e9; from before 1900. \n*There is a registered packet containing additional printed material including the booklet; Russian list and English translation; a newspaper clipping and catalogue of the exhibition.",
