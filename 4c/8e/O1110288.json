            "bibliography": "James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray (c. 1531 \u2013 23 January 1570), here entitled 'the Regent Murray', was a member of the House of Stewart as the illegitimate son of King James V. Hamilton was a Scottish supporter of Mary, Queen of Scots. He shot Moray from the steps of his uncle Archbishop John Hamilton's house in Linlithgow, in what is believed to be the first assassination using a firearm. The main motive for the assassination was supposedly rooted in political rivalries in Scotland at the time. On 23 January, 1570, Hamilton fired at the Regent from a window, behind some washing, and mortally wounded him. After a desperate ride, closely pursued by the Regent's men, James made it to the safety of his triumphant kin in Hamilton. Buchanan wrote that the fatal shot also killed the horse of one of Moray's companions. Regent Moray was said to have dismounted, wounded below his navel. He walked to his lodgings and died the same day, according to the Diurnal of Occurents at Linlithgow Palace in the hour before midnight. The incident was described in the contemporary diary of Robert Birrel as follows: The Earl of Moray, the Good Regent, was slain in Linlithgow by James Hamilton of Bothwell-haugh, who shot the said Regent with a gun out at ane window, and presently thereafter fled out at the back, and leapt on a very good horse, which the Hamiltons had ready waiting for him; and, being followed speedily, after that spur and wand had failed him, he drew forth his dagger, and struck his horse behind; whilk causit the horse to leap a very broad stank; by whilk means he escaped. The weapon illustrated in this painting by Cattermole is a fire-lock and said to be inaccurate. The incident is also depicted on stained glass in St. Giles' Cathedral in Edinburgh.",
