There are four repeats of the pattern in the full width of fabric which still retains both selvedges. The fabric is a double cloth with fine cotton warps and untwisted cotton weft threads. Each thread of coloured warp and weft alternates with black giving the fabric its characteristic appearance seen in much weaving done in Northern France at this period.",

Registered File number 1989/480.\nThe fabric was designed by The Silver Studio ca. 1898 and sold to one of two French manufacturers, either Vanoutryve of Roubaix or Leborgne of Lannoy, near Lille.\nIt has not been possible to positively date the design of this textile as the Silver Studio day books for this period are missing.\n\nThe fabric was first brought into the Museum for an opinion during 1988 and was bought from Phillips sale No. 379 on 23rd March 1989.\n\nThere are two small scraps of the design in the collection (Circ. 269-1966 and T.168G-1979). Attached to Circ.269-1966 there is a label with 'Pon. 6022 Col 10' written on it. This presumably refers to the pattern number of the fabric when woven rather than the design.",
