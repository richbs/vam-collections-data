It follows the classic <i>qipao</i> style in that it closes to the right, has a stiffened, stand-up collar and side slits at the hem. The dress has short sleeves. It has bust and waist darts and seams across the shoulders, features that were not originally part of the <i>qipao</i> aesthetic.

There is a large decorative fastening at collarbone level, also made from red and yellow satin.  It is shaped like a flower head and  two long life characters. The button itself is a small red knot. In addition to this decorative closure, the top is fastened with press-studs and there is a zip fastener in the side seam under the arm. The dress is lined with plain red silk.\n[Fragment] Offcut fragment, a section of the red self-patterned silk leftover from the tailoring.\n[Button] Knot button in red and yellow satin.

There are, however, press-studs along the collarbone, a hook and eye at the neck, and a zip up the right hand side.  This type of dress is known as a cheongsam or qipao and the decorative frogging became one it its distinctive features.  As which most cheongsams of this sort, the frogging matches the trim around the edges.  Whether they are plain or convoluted, each fastening is composed of two parts.  The 'eye' is the half that includes the loop and this part is sewn on the upper side of the dress.  The 'head' incorporates the knot button and is fixed to the  lower side.  Whereas most cheongsam tailors are men, women are employed to make these buttons and loops.  Strips of bias-cut cloth are passed around thin wire, which is then twisted into the desired shape and sewn down onto the dress.  The flower formation echoes the  flowers woven into the red damask of this garment and there are two 'long life' characters also incorporated into the fastening.",

            "history_note": "This qipao was especially commissioned by the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1995 as the museum already had a growing collection of historic qipao. The decision to acquire a contemporary example was  timely in view of the revival of interest in national dress of all kinds worldwide.  Mr Leung ( Leung Ching Wah) of Linva Tailor was chosen on the advice of members of the very active Textile Society of Hong Kong. As the qipao is a bespoke garment, and one of its chief features is a perfect fit, it had to be fitted to a model and a V&A curator, Verity Wilson ( Far Eastern Section, V&A from 1979-2005) served as the client for Mr Leung.  Mr Leung, who had never heard of the V&A, had been in business in Cochrane Steet, Hong Kong, for 25 years. Although many Hong Kong qipao tailors were originally from Shanghai, as is Mr Leung, especially after the communist takeover in the PRC in 1949, today this is not necessarily the case. There were five tailors at work in Linva Tailor at the time the V&A's dress was being made. Mr Leung's wife was the accountant.\n\nThe choice of material, general style and button closures were negotiated between Mr Leung and the client.  However, the rather staid and subdued cream, bamboo-patterned silk with mushroom-coloured edging that was first chosen was rejected finally in favour of the bright red and yellow qipao that is now FE.313.1-1995.  It may be a coincidence but these colours are those of the flag of the People's Republic, to which Hong Kong was to return two years later in 1997. \n\nMeasurements were taken in silence, nothing was written down, the red silk (called 'an old-style pattern' by Mr Leung) was folded and the outlines of the shape marked on the silk with soft tailor's chalk and a metal ruler. Only one fitting was needed.\n\nMr Leung kept a handdrawn card of all the different variations of frogging - these pushed the price up considerably\n\nPlease see the RF 95/1375 for photographs of the shop, the street in Hong Kong, the dress being made and Mr Leung.",
