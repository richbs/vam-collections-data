This original complicated and colourful pattern was printed by the indigo discharge method and took a long time to produce. Consequently, it was expensive to buy.  Despite this it became one of Morris & Co.'s most commercially successful textiles and is now his most recognisable design.\n\nThis reproduction of 'Strawberry Thief' uses modern chemical dyestuffs and was not discharge printed and so looks very different from the versions originally printed to Morris's specification. It is possible however that the original blocks were used to produce this fabric, as the blocks were obtained by Stead McAlpin on the liquidation of Morris & Co. in 1940.",
