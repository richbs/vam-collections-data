On one side are Scholar Zhang, Cui Yingying and her maid Hongniang, and the presence of the monk Facong makes it clear that they are at Pujiu Temple, where Zhang catches the first glimpse of Yingying and is stunned by her beauty. The other side of the bowl shows Zhang alone with Yingying, the latter having been persuaded to grant him an interview. The lid is painted with five boys playing in a garden. The bowl has two chi dragon handles in biscuit, with traces of red pigment and gilding.  On the lid is a biscuit knop in the shape of a lion also with traces of gilding. A four-character mark in two lines is on the base: Deyu Tang zhi (made for the Hall of Jade-like Virtue).\nThe painting style still shows some of the characteristics of the Ming/Qing transitional period, for instance the grasses are painted V-shaped, only inverted. The chi dragon handles in their original state would have looked exactly like those on the yellow waterpot, and the two vessels should be of similar date.\nNo information is available about the Deyu Tang.",
