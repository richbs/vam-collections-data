The Museum Number is in the top left hand corner. The embroidery has been cut down the right hand side. A tapering piece has been added to the left hand side and the embroidery has been cut in the lower left hand side. There is no border along the bottom, just an embroidered black line. \n\nThe main pattern is a series of diagonal lines from lower right to upper left. These are of orange.\nThere are three sizes of stripes:\n[1] very narrow stripes: pink flowers amid lots of green leaves.\n[2] wider stripes: a pink flower with a pair of green leaves and a pale flower.  These alternate direction, facing either lower left or upper right.\n[3] Wider stripes with two designs: [a] blue ground with diamond segments: pink and white vase with large pink blossom surrounded by white flowers alternating with what could be a long-necked vase and triangular group of pale flowers and pink flowers creating the edge of the diamond. [b] green ground with diamond segments: vase with central triangular group of round pink flowerheads surrounded by white flowers with light blue and pink details alternating with a vase, central blue cross-shaped flower surrounded by blue striped flowers.\n\nThreads: Silk, 2S: dark blue, light blue, green, light green, pink, light pink, orange, dark green, white.",
