He became a collector after his marriage to a rich widow in 1649. He was a member of the Royal Society but his main interest was in alchemy, astrology and magic.  Elias Ashmole helped John Tradescant the Younger (1608-1662), the royal gardener, collector, traveller and importer of exotic plants, to catalogue the Tradescants' collection of curiosities. Tradescant made over this 'Closett of Rarities' to Elias Ashmole in 1659. Ashmole subsequently presented the collection to Oxford University, where it formed the basis of the Ashmolean Museum.\n\nThis print shows the bust of Ashmole raised on a pedestal that is supported by an arrangement of books. The symbol on the pedestal is Ashmole's birth sign, Gemini (the Twins) and below, to one side, his arms and family crest, a running greyhound.\n\nOwnership & Use\nElias Ashmole paid William Faithorne seven pounds for making this plate in 1656. The print was used by Ashmole as a frontispiece to various volumes of his manuscript notes. It was once thought to have been made for use as a bookplate, but it was never intended for this purpose.",
