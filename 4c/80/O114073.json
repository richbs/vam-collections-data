These paintings date from the 1st century BC to about AD 480 and are the oldest surviving examples of painting in India. They depict stories from the lives of the Buddha (the Jatakas). \n\nThe scene here is from the Mahisa Jataka. It tells of a man with special powers who sees that a buffalo (Mahisa) wants to bathe in the lake. The buffalo is being tormented by a monkey that has climbed up on his back. The man throws the monkey to the ground and teaches the buffalo a protective charm in the presence of the god Indra.\n\nThe Ajanta cave complex was discovered in 1819 and since then attempts have been made to document the paintings inside them. In 1844 Major Robert Gill was commissioned to make copies. Unfortunately most of the paintings he completed were destroyed in a fire in 1866. From 1872 to 1885 John Griffiths from the Bombay School of Art and seven Indian students spent every winter at the caves producing approximately 300 paintings. This is one of them.",

The main part of this painting depicts scenes from the Mahisa Jataka.\n\nNarrative:\n\nStanding behind a rock a genius observes that a buffalo (Mahisa), who wants to bathe in the lake is being tormented by a monkey that has climbed up on his back. After the genius has thrown the monkey to the ground, he teaches the buffalo a protective charm in the presence of god Indra. (ref: Dieter Schlingloff).",

They depict stories from the lives of the Buddha (the jatakas) and date from the 1st century BC to about AD 480. The cave complex was discovered in 1819 and since then attempts have been made to document the paintings inside them. In 1844 Major Robert Gill was commissioned to make copies. Unfortunately most of the paintings he completed were destroyed in a fire in 1866. To make up for this loss, from 1872, John Griffiths from the Bombay school of Art and seven Indian students spent every winter for the following 13 years at the caves producing approximately 300 paintings, of which this is an example.",
