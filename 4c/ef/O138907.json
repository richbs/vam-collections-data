As she describes it: 'From today, car drivers using mobile phones are to be fined. At the same time, Blair has announced at the weekend that he is to hold a nationwide \u201cBig Conversation\u201d with the British public, in response to widespread criticism for ignoring the million-strong Peace March protesting the war in Iraq.'\n\n'Marf' drew daily topical cartoons for the Evening Standard between March 2002 and August 2005, moving to the Londoner's Diary page in August 2003. The drawings cover key political and social issues of the period, providing a vivid and often hilarious response to the main news of the day. The Evening Standard is London's only evening newspaper, publishing up to five editions a day. In Marf's own words: 'The cartoonist needs to keep up with the rapid pace of event.'",
