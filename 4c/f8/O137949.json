In this particular photograph, the thinness of paper and the dullness of albumen indicate an early example of that process dating from the 1850s to the 1860s.  It is from an album of photographs from the Victorian metalworker Francis Skidmore's (1817-1896) firm.  It is of a half pair of gates for the Caledonian Railway Company and the photograph is annotated with the cost of \u00a3400 for the pair to be made in 'all Wrought Iron'. It was made at Skidmore's firm either at West Orchard from 1853 or from six years later at Alma Street, Coventry.  This photograph is thus a record of the completed gates and their cost.  The Caledonian Railway Company was established by an Act of 31 July 1845. The company  included the amalgamation of a number of existing lines in Scotland.",

The company  included the amalgamation of a number of existing lines in Scotland.  The date of the establishment of this company might have a bearing on when the gates were made and the photograph taken.",
