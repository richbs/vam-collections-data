The Teutonic Knights were among the more successful military orders. They were given papal approval in 1199 and oversaw the colonization by German settlers and the imposition of Christianity in what is now Poland and Lithuania. Like their counterparts, the Templars, who suffered the brutal suppression and nationalization of their assets by the French crown just after 1300, they operated a system of banking to get money 'to the front line'. This Bible was made in Li\u00e8ge for their house of Nieuwe Biesen in Maastricht, where the order owned property. The ornament in the initials is inhabited by dragons, heads and grotesques which spill over into the margins.",
