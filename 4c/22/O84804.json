His great-grandson, John Chute, erected a marble monument to him at The Vyne, Hampshire, and this is a preliminary model for the recumbent figure. It shows Chaloner Chute wearing his Speaker\u2019s robes. The model was once housed in a leather case (probably dating from the 19th century), which was presented to the Museum by the donor in 1911; this no longer survives.\n\nThomas Carter was one of a dynasty of sculptors and masons who specialised in monuments and chimneypieces. He is recorded as having been paid for the Chute monument in the family chapel at The Vyne, in Hampshire, in 1785, but may have employed another sculptor to execute the work.",

Avray Tipping, the editor of Country Life, whose writings played a role in encouraging interest in eighteenth-century English art and architecture. The work itself is the result of an eighteenth-century interest in an earlier English past. The full-scale monument, which is based on this small preliminary model, was commissioned by Chaloner Chute to commemorate his seventeenth-century ancestor. It was placed in a family chapel attached to the house at the same time as the windows were set with fragments of medieval glass under the guidance of Chute's friend, Horace Walpole. From the start, the monument was conceived as a conscious revival of earlier English styles. \nEarly in the twentieth century Avray Tipping wrote about Chute and his house in Country Life and presumably acquired the model around this time. In giving it to the Museum in 1911, he was not only adding to an already substantial collection of sculptors' models but making an early contribution to the Museum's eighteenth-century English sculpture. The model was identified as being by Thomas Carter through the archival work of Rupert Gunnis, whose Dictionary of British Sculptors (1953) remains a standard work. The Chaloner Chute thus represents two distinct phases in the historiography of \"Englishness\" and English art, involving several key figures from both periods.\n\nLit.
