By the 1620s, most parishes possessed not only a communion cup and paten but also an alms dish and flagon. The advent of alms dishes reflected the new emphasis on collecting gifts of money (alms) for the poor instead of for the church. Many more flagons were made in response to ecclesiastical regulations of 1603 that ordered the provision of suitable vessels to contain wine for the communion cup. \n\nGifts by parishioners revived after decades of comparative neglect. Wealthy local patrons commissioned costly silver vessels to beautify the altar for the \u2018Lord\u2019s Supper\u2019, as the communion service was often termed. These were larger and more practical than earlier Protestant vessels and often came as matching sets. Benefactors also donated domestic flagons, dishes and cups for use in the church.",
