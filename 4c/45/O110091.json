On the lid a panel of white satin embroidered in coloured silks, metal purl and beads. Mainly in brick stitch, knots, detailed buttonhole fillings, couched, laid and raised work. In the centre, a lady in a red dress and blue stole sits, holding a basket of fruit and a tulip, between an acorn-tree with a squirrel and a green leafy tree. Below this scene is fish-pond. On the left hand side of the panel, from top to bottom, are a house with mica windows, a caterpillar, a gaily-coloured parrot in a cherry-tree, a unicorn and a tulip. On the right hand side are a castle with mica windows, a snail, a bird on a branch bearing leaves and fruit, a ladybird and a stag between two flowers. The four sides of the casket are decorated with panels of laid work in a geometrical design of flowers and fruit. The casket is lined with padded pink silk. Inside the lid is a mirror surrounded by a stuck-on design of narrow silver braid. Behind the mirror is a piece of marbled paper, and so also on the bottom of the box.",

The casket would have been one of her last exercises in the art of embroidery, and she would put all her learnt skills into the piece. The lid panel is of white satin embroidered in coloured silks, metal purl and beads. The stitches used are mainly brick stitch, knots, detailed buttonhole fillings, couched, laid and raised work. The four sides of the casket are decorated with panels of laid work in geometricised designs of flowers and fruit, and the edges are covered with lacquer imitating tortoiseshell.",
