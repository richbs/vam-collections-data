In the 17th century, contemporaries remarked on the lack of excessive ostentation even in the richest merchants\u2019 houses. Their silver was exquisitely made and in generous supply, but it was understated in design. Attempts to make grand diplomatic silver could sometimes backfire. A huge Dutch ewer in the Kremlin, made for Tsar Alexei Miklailovich in 1646, resembles a clumsily large version of a small-scale object.\n\nDutch prosperity was based on political independence. In 1579 seven Protestant provinces in the north of the Netherlands united in throwing off Catholic Spanish rule. Protestant refugees from the southern Netherlands swelled the population of the United Provinces (present-day Holland) which rapidly built a global empire based on maritime prowess. As a result, many levels of society enjoyed an increase in prosperity and silver was produced in almost every town. Utrecht and Delft were important centres in the 16th century. Later, Amsterdam and The Hague attracted goldsmiths in large numbers.",
