During this period he also worked for the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and also designed costumes from a number of Gilbert&Sullivan productions.\n\nThe Gipsy Girl, or Zigeunerliebe in the original German, is an operetta by Franz Leh\u00e1r. The English lyrics for this production at Daly's Theatre, London were written by Basil Hood and Adrian Ross.\n\nThe story follows Ilona who is engaged to Jonel. After meeting Jozsi, a gipsy violinist, Ilona doubts her feelings towards Jonel and wonders if she would be happier with Jozsi. Ilona dreams of a life with Jozsi but realises she would not be happy. On awakening she devotes herself to Jonel.\n\nZigeunerliebe premiered at the Carltheatre in Vienna in 1910. The production that these costume designs are from opened at Daly's Theatre on 1st June 1912.\n\nThis design come from a collection of items given to the Museum by the Emile Littler Estate. Emile Littler (1903-1985) was a manager and producer, whose early career embraced both general theatrical management and stage management before he started in management on his own in 1934. He was married to the actress and Principal boy Cora Goffin whose success was such that her legs were insured for \u00a320,000. She continued to tour the provinces and Ireland in her husband's productions until her retirement from the stage in 1940.  By the 1950s Littler was presenting plays, musicals and pantomimes and during his lifetime he wrote and directed over fifteen productions at various London theatres and over 200 throughout Britain. In 1974 he received a Knighthood and was made a freeman of the city of London. He died 11 years later in January 1985.",
