Certain features, however, suggest that this chair was made outside London. These include its rather square and thick proportions, and the use of oak for the seat rails (under the walnut veneer), which on a London-made chair would usually be beech. A strong clue to its place of manufacture is provided by the marquetry coat of arms, which represent the 5th Viscount and Viscountess Molyneux of Croxteth Park, near Liverpool. An almost identical set of chairs, but with the arms of the Earls of Derby, was made for Knowsley Hall, very close to Croxteth. Consequently this type of chair was likely a speciality of a Liverpool furniture maker, who so far remains unidentified. A hundred years later Liverpool was an important centre of furniture making, but these are probably the most ambitious pieces of Liverpool-made furniture known from the early 18th century.",
