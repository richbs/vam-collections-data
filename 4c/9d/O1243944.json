The theatre's director, W. Bridges-Adams, was determined to proceed with the 1926 Shakespeare Festival's productions and, only two days after the fire, alterations were being made to a local cinema to enable it to accommodate the theatre company. The cinema was used for Shakespeare for six years while a new Shakespeare Memorial Theatre was under construction, the final Shakespeare performance being given there on 12 September 1931. \n\nThis sign is one of several used at the cinema between 1926 and 1931.",
