On the outsides of the body and the cover, and the inside of the cover, are the three following Pali inscriptions, written in the early Brahmi characters : -Inside the cover, 'Sapurisa(sa) Majhimasa', i.e. [the relics] of the Emancipate Kasapagota (kasayapagotra) the Teacher of the whole Hemawanta (Himalaya region).  Outside the body, 'Sapurisasa Haritiputasa,' i.e., [the relics] of the Emancipated Haritiputa (Haritiputra) \nAfter the Council of Patna, convened in the 18th year of the reign of the Emperor Asoka (B.C. 273-232), the Arhats Kasayapagotra and Majhima with three other missionaries went to the Central Himalayan District (Hemavate) to spread the newly coordinated Buddhist doctrine in those parts.  Fragments of the bones of these two saints were formerlycontained in this casket.  As to Haritiputra, nothing certain is known of him, but he may have been one of the Council of Patna, or possibly a missionary.",

The other two pieces of calcined bone from this casket appear to have been handed over to Professor M.S Sundarain, Education Counsellor at the Indian High Commission, on 18th June 1958, the Ministry of Education in London having suggested that all Buddhist relics from Sanchi and Sonari still in the V&A should be offered to the Indian Government (see also under  IM219 &221-1921).",
