At the centre is a pile of rocks which appears also behind the woman at the left, rising up to the border of the field.  At the right edge of the pile a naked youth is sitting cross-legged, his left hand raised palm out towards a woman, possibly holding her dress. His features are broken away.  Behind his left leg protrudes a hooked object, a pedum (shepherd's throwing stick) or possibly a bow.  The woman might also be taken to be seated but she leans towards the youth, with her right hand raised and half-clenched as though holding something, her left resting in the youth's right forearm. Her cloak is slipping from her left shoulder and is draped from her hips over her legs leaving the torso bare.  Her hair is rolled over a headband and dressed to a top- knot.  It is not clear whether there was a skin or cloth stretched over the centre part of the rocks.",
