            "physical_description": "Red silk velvet cope embroidered with silver and silver-gilt thread and coloured silks.\n\nWth scenes from the Life of the Virgin. This cope is semi-circular with a wide orphrey sewn along the long straight edge. The main body of the cope is made of red silk velvet which is embroidered with sacred scenes, apostles and saints in three concentric zones made up of multifoil ogee arches adorned with oak sprigs, lions and lion-masks; seated angels holding stars occupy the spandrels. The orphreys comprise architectural niches containing ecclesiastics and kings. \n\nIn areas of the lions's mask where the pearls have worn away, a layer of white silk is visible. The design was probably originally drawn on this silk and through the silk velvet. The dark outlinees may well be remains of black silk outlines.\n\nThe body of the cope is made of red silk velvet embroidered with gold, silver and silk thread, pearls, beads and small metal rings. The needlework is stitched through the velvet ground, not worked separately and then applied. Before working, the surface of the velvet was overlaid with thin fabric which shows through where the embroidery has worn away. The stitches used are underside couching (for most of the metal threads), surface couching (on the Infant Christ's gold robe in the central scene and the drapery of the lectern in the Annunciation group) and for tying down laid silk, split stitch (for silk embroidery), French knots and satin stitch. The draperies, in gold with silk borders and linings, have the folds marked by narrow bands of gold laid in contrary direction to the rest of the surface. Features of the faces are outlined in black silk and cheeks are stitched in loop-shaped spirals, slightly indented at the centre. Many accessories such as crowns and caskets show a surface of loosely-stitched white silk, the preparatory ground work for pearl fillings (the pearls are now missing in most cases). \n\nThree concentric zones of arcaded imagery spread over the surface of the vestment, framing three central scenes and 24 standing figures ranged on either side. Between the three arcades, the spandrels form two lesser zones. The gold columns of the arcades are composed of twisted branches bearing a large oak-leaf and acorn on either side just above each intersection. The columns of the lower arcade rest on gold lions with bushy manes and tails worked in raised gold and with blue silk ears and claws.\n\nThe lions crouch on grassy mounds made of green silk laid horizontally across the velvet and tied down with close lines of yellow split stitch. The mounds are strewn with flowers, such as daisies and forget-me-nots, worked in French knots, split and satin stitch. The crocketted arches have five lobes from the points of which hang oak-leaves and acorns. Lion masks with protruding pink tongues, bright blue ears and mouths and white teeth are found at the points where the arches join the columns and where the upper columns spring from the spandrels of the rows below. The masks were formerly covered with pearls and the protruding eyes were made of green beads enclosed in small gold rings, a few of which still remain.\n\nIn the spandrels of the arches are twenty-four angels, fifteen in the lower zone are slightly larger than the eleven above. Four set in the half-spandrels abutting onto the orphrey, stand holding large stars with six-curved points. The others are seated on thrones made of beasts set back to back (two in the upper zone and four in the lower), with heads worked in gold, broad silver collars and bodies worked in gold wound on bright green silk. All angels have yellow hair, framed by a gold nimbus, and their outspread wings are worked in gold and silver, each feather being veined with a chequered silk line. The stars were formerly covered with pearls, with a green bed in the centre, but these only remain in one instance.\n\nIn the side spandrels of the double arch at the centre of the cope two parakeets confront each other, their heads turned backwards. Their heads and wings are green, their bodies yellow.\n\nThe following subjects are represented: \n\nIn the three central panels on the back of the cope, each of which is contained in a double arch of the arcade, reading from top to bottom:\n\n1. Coronation of the Virgin: Central piece missing. On a throne of gold arcading, surmounted by a frieze of quatrefoils tinted pink, blue and green, and a pale green cushion fretted with buff silk trellis tied with pink spots and crosses, sit facing each other, the Virgin, crowned and nimbed, with hands clasped in adoration, and Christ, one hand raised in blessing, the other resting on a tripartite globe worked in silver, green and sepia. Both figures have long, flowing hair, the Virgin's yellow, Christ's in two shades of yellow. The Virgin's robe has a brown and white patterned lining representing fur, and a yellow border, with gold trellis. Christ's cloak is lined with white silk and has a pink border with blue chevrons, the sleeves of his robe are lined with yellow.\n\n2. Adoration of the Magi: The Virgin, crowned and nimbed and with long flowing yellow hair, holds in her right hand a sceptre in the form of a scrolling flower sprig. She is seated on a throne of gold arcading surmounted by a band of pink silk covered by a blue, gold and white trellis, and bearing a yellow silk cushion tied down by a pink, white and gold trellis.The Virgin's cloak has a patterned fur lining as in the Coronation scene, and a pink and white border. Her robe has a blue border around neck and sleeves. She is supporting the Infant Christ who stands on her knee holding out his arms towards a goblet (once encrusted with pearls) presented by a kneeling king. The Child has yellow hair and his gold robe is spotted with blue. A small bird (almost obliterated) hangs from his left hand. The kneeling king has a bald crown and flowing white hair and beard. The other two Kings stand bearing gifts and one of them points to a star above the Child's head. The robes of all three kings have patterned fur linings. One of the kings has yellow hair and yellow shoes covered by a pink and white trellis, the other has green and yellow hair and beard.\n\n3. The Anunciation: An angel with short yellow hair, stitched in indented spirals, wearing a cloak with yellow lining and gold and white border and a robe with blue lining and pink and yellow border and with wings half-furled, holds out a long scroll inscribed AVE MARIA GRACIA in black silk letters upon gold. He approaches the Virgin who stands with one hand raised and the other resting upon a draped lectern, upon which lies an open book inscribed with the word AMEN in black letters on a silver page. The Virgin has long, flowing yellow hair and a green and gold bordered cloak with patterned fur lining as in the other two scenes. Between the Virgin and the angel is a two-handled vase containing a lily with three white flowers. Above the Virgin the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove, once encrusted with pearls, with crossed nimbus, flies downwards.\n\nIn the remaining four arcades, there are figures of saints and apostles, each standing on a small gold platform supported by gold foliage.

Between them are scrolling flower sprigs, one variety of four red columbine blossoms with yellowish green foliage, the other four five-lobed pink flowers with myrtle-green leaves. The bare central spandrel at the top of the cope is covered by the small triangular hood. The decoration consists of two angels in plum-coloured draperies and with red nimbi leaning from clouds and swinging censers, on a patterned gold ground.\n \nThe orphrey has a gold background with rich and varied ornaments such as heraldic lions, spread eagles, rosettes, fleur-de-lys, trefoils and small geometric devices, couched in the opposite direction to the ground or raised in low relief by a thread underlay. Eight architectural niches placed one above the other have arches, like those on the cope but worked in shaded green, red and blue silk, springing from side piers ending in ornamental pinnacles surmounted by finials. The piers enriched with three tiers of panels filled with geometrical patterns in coloured silks and separated by square blocks containing gold quatrefoils. In the spandrels above the arches are two rampant griffins facing one another; they were once covered with pearls. The niches are separated by oblong panels each containing a central six-lobed rosette within an octagonal frame, supported by two heraldic lions of England, one on either side, facing one another. All this was formerly encrusted with pearls.\n\nThe figures in the niches are eccelsiastics and kings, and placed so that an ecclesiastic and a king always face each other when the cope is worn. The kings wear fur-lined mantles of green shaded with yellow and the priests brown-red chasubles over green and yellow dalmatics. They have no names or symbols.

            "public_access_description": "This cope illustrates the third of the three major decorative schemes found in English copes of the medieval period, which overlap chronologically. In the two other schemes the figures are arranged in horizontal rows, and thus are not ideally suited to the curved shape of the cope (the Syon Cope, also in the V&A's collection, is an example of this). In this example, however, the figures framed within Gothic arches are arranged in concentric rows so that they follow the curved edge and sit favorably in relation to the hem.\n\nThe red velvet ground of Italian origin is an ideal foil for the high quality English embroidery (called opus anglicanum, the Latin for English work), which was sought after throughout Europe and bought by princes and popes. The scenes show the Life of the Virgin; apostles and saints with crouching lions; lion masks; angels; and a pair of birds.\nThe cope relates very closely to a chasuble now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, known as the Chichester-Constable chasuble, and it is possible that they may have been designed to be used together. Vestments like this one illustrate the sumptuous and costly textiles which were favoured by the Christian church, often given by wealthy donors, making a conspicuous show of both earthly wealth and spiritual devotion.",

New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 2008, p. 40, fig. 32 (detail) and p. 43.\nIn her chapter on 'Painters and the Design of Woven Silks', the author notes that the embroidery on the cope reveals Cennini's method of designing for embroiderers on velvet. the design was drawn upon a layer of white silk which could be applied to the velvet and then embroidered. The lion's mask shown in the photograph shows that where the pearls have worn away, the white silk layer can be clearly seen.",

            "history_note": "This cope illustrates the third of the three major decorative schemes found in English copes of the medieval period. The design is particularly suited to the shape of the cope, with the figures being framed within Gothic arches and arranged in concentric rows that follow the curved edge. (In the two other schemes the figures are arranged in horizontal rows, and thus are not ideally suited to the curved shape of the cope. The Syon Cope (83-1864), also in the V&A's collection, is an example of the less sympathetic arrangement.) The use of such rich decoration, embroidery using pearls and gold threads, must have made the garment very heavy to wear, imposing a stately gait for processions; it would also have been particulary impressive to a viewing public for whom such showiness was the preserve of Church and Court and accessible only from a distance. It should be noted, too, that the major scenes of the Coronation of the Virgin, the Adoration of the Kings, and the Annunciation are one above each other in the most visible position on the cope when it was on the body of a clergyman (i.e. central back).\n\nThe V&A first expressed interest in acquiring the cope in 1938 when Lt. Colonel W. E. I. Butler Bowdon (of Dapsland, Mayfield, Sussex) intimated that he would be offering it for sale via Christies. At that time it was considered 'undoubtedly the most important English vestment ever to come on the market'. (Minute of C.E.C.Tattersall, Keeper of Textiles to the Director, 1 March 1938). Indeed in putting the case for funding from the National Art Fund, the Director described it thus: 'This is a magnificent example of opus Anglicanum, which was exhibited here in the Exhibition of Mediaeval English Art [1930] and which we have long regarded as one of the few essential objects in this country which should if possible be secured; for it is of a totally different type to any that we have' (25 April 1938). Initially the Colonel held out for \u00a310,000. \n\nEventually, in 1955 in the face of the acquisition of the cope by the Metropolitan Museum of Art for \u00a333,000, Wingfield Digby lodged a bar on the request for an export licence (8 January 1955); the Review committee met on February 24 and confirmed in writing that if the V&A could make an offer of this amount or come to an arrangement with the Met, then no export licence would be granted (18 March 1955). An extract from Hansard (Vol. 542, no. 13, Cols. 86 & 87) records the purchase of the cope: \u00a35,000 & \u00a33,000 from the National Art Collections Fund and the Pilgrim Trust respectively; \u00a315,000 from the Museum's own resources (included \u00a3812.10s from City Companies), and \u00a39,000 from the Chancellor of the Exchequer, 'subject to the approval of Parliament, to find through an addition to the Museum Purchase Grant for the current financial year.'\n\nAccording to the accession register, the cope was owned by the Butler-Bowdon family and their ancestors from time immemorial. It was probably cut up some time before 1721 and turned into a set of vestments comprising chasuble, stole, maniple and altar frontal or dossal. Subsequently, in 1854 the Rev. W. I. Clifford S. J. reassembled it in the form it was in when it arrived in the museum in 1955. Between 1955 and 1957 it was remounted by Mrs Birkill, the ground being filled in with red velvet of 16th-17th century. The missing portions of the design were filled in with painted restoration.\n\nNote: the spelling of the original owner's name is Butler-Bowdon when he signs letters; his name is mispellt as Bowden in certain letters addressed to or about him in 1955.\n\nHistorical significance: While the red silk velvet ground is probably Italian in origin, the high quality embroidery is most likely English. Called <i>opus anglicanum</i> (the Latin for English work), this kind of embroidery was sought after throughout Europe and bought by princes and popes. The prominent position of three English saints in the embroidery on the body of the cope should be noted, as should the two heraldic lions of England on the orphreys. St Edward the Confessor is prominent in the central row on the left hand front side of the cope and St Edmund of Bury stands opposite him on the right hand side. The archbishop alongside St Edmund has tentatively been identified as St Thomas of Canterbury. \n\nThe incrustation of this cope with pearls, gold and beads was particularly rich, a fact that is difficult to appreciate in its current state of conservation; its weight and 'showiness' must have been impressive - especially in a processional context. The cope relates very closely to a chasuble now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, known as the Chichester-Constable chasuble. It is possible that they may have been designed to be used together (good colour images in <i>The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin</i>. Winter 1995/6, pp.36-7). The remains of another cope in the Museu Episcopal de Vic in Vic are so similar that they could have come from the same workshop.\n\nVestments like this one illustrate the sumptuous and costly textiles which were favoured by the Christian church, often given by wealthy donors, making a conspicuous show of both earthly wealth and spiritual devotion. The significance and value of the textile are underlined by the fact that during its history it was firstly cut into smaller ecclesiastical items, and then in the mid nineteenth century reassembled in the form of a cope, using 16th or 17th century velvet in the restoration.  The painted restoration of the orphreys is also of a very high standard. \n\nBy the late 1930s, the Museum deemed it the most important example of ecclesiastical embroidery in existence in private ownership and in the mid 1950s an export stop and funding from central government and other bodies enabled the Museum to acquire it.",

            "historical_context_note": "By the thirteenth century clerical attire was more or less stabilized throughout the Latin Christian church. According to the <i>Rationale for the Divine Offices</i> of the canonist and liturgist William Durandus (d. 1296), all ranks of the higher clergy were entitled to wear the cope (or <i>pluviale</i>) for processional occasions on feast days. As a result, inventories of monastic churches testify to the existence of a very large number of copes, Canterbury, for example, owning no fewer than sixty copes in 1315. (Dyan Elliot, 'Dressing and Undressing the Clergy',  in E. Jane Burns ed. <i>Medieval Fabrications. Dress, Textiles, Cloth, and Other Cultural Imaginings</i>. London, 2004, pp. 56-58; Pauline Johnstone. <i>High Fashion in the Church</i>. Leeds, 2002, p. 11.)\n\nThe cope had developed from the same Roman garment (<i>paenula</i>) as the chasuble, but by the eleventh century had a different form: it was semi-circular and open down the front; the front opening fastened just below the neck across the chest with a short strip of embroidered material or a morse (a metal clasp); orphrey bands ran the full length of the front opening and on the back, the cope retained a vestigial hood which was triangular (as in the case of this example) or shield-shaped.
