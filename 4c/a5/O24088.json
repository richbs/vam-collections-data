It was made by Tomimoto Kenkichi (1886-1963), an architect and designer whom Leach met near the beginning of his stay in Japan from 1909 to 1920. Tomimoto accompanied Leach to the pottery decorating party that inspired him to become a potter. He also acted as an interpreter when Leach started taking pottery lessons in the autumn of 1911. Tomimoto, who also became a famous potter, started experimenting with ceramics the following summer and made this bowl when he visited Leach in Tokyo that autumn. Leach, to whom Tomimoto gave the bowl, recollected towards the end of his life that it was Tomimoto\u2019s \u2018very first pot\u2019. While this is not strictly true, it is a famous story often recounted by aficionados of Japanese studio ceramics.",
