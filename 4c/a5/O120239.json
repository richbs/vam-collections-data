            "public_access_description": "Earthenware flatbacks and figurines for mantelpiece decoration were first produced in  Staffordshire in the late 1830s.  The earliest datable Staffordshire figures appear to be those of Queen Victoria, who was crowned in 1837.  Images of royalty proved lucrative and during the 1840s Staffordshire pottery firms issued countless other royal figures. Although some appeared after Victoria's death in 1901, few appear to have been produced after 1905.  During their heyday however they were produced in vast numbers, usually modelled after prints. As well as the royal family they represented a wide variety of subjects, those of actors and actresses being especially popular.\n\nThis has been identified as the child actor Master Betty, or William Henry West Betty (1791-1874) who made his first stage appearance at Belfast in 1803 and took London by storm in the 1804-1805 season when he appeared at Covent Garden and Drury Lane in all the major Shakespearean tragic roles, causing an outburst of 'Bettymania' in London and ousting even the great Mrs Siddons and John Philip Kemble from favour.  His success was short-lived however, and after a while living in Cambridge his return to the Covent Garden stage in the 1812-1813 season was not a success.  His father squandered his money and he spent the rest of his life in obscurity. A companion figure to this (S.334-1984) has been identified as Miss Davenport.",
