It has a hinged lid at the front and is carved on  all sides with openwork ornament. The integral suspension attachment consists of three-dimensional openwork foliage spray. The lid is hinged with two silver rivets. Its decoration consists of an elaborate inhabited vine scroll with grooved stem which grows up from the base and is clasped at intervals by short tufts of acanthus growing out of the plain border whicxh runs round the entire composition.\nAt the centre of the cross an archer crouches in foliage aiming upwards at a bird biting a cherry; below him an entangled quadruped bites at the foliage. \nOn the reverse is a central roundel containing the Agnus Dei with a halo and cross surrounded by the four evangelist symbols with wings and halos in semicircular frames. The two sides are also decorated with regular inhabited plant scrolls, that on the right side with biting quadrupeds and small flowers, that on the left with a more robust scroll and a mixture of birds and quadrupeds. The decoration  of the two ends of the lateral arms consists of: left, an eagle subduing a monster in its talons; and right a symmetrical acanthus scroll with lobed leaves.",

The reverse shows the Lamb of God surrounded by the four symbols of the evangelists. The cross originally formed a case for a gold box, perhaps containing relics of the True Cross.\n\nThe iconography is complex, but fully within the Anglo-Saxon tradition. All four sides are carved with versions of the Tree of Life, the vine scroll clustered with living creatures, which symbolises both the union of God and his creation, and of Christ and the Church.The image of the Agnus Dei surrounded by the four evangelist symbols, which unites both eucharistic and apocalyptic themes and so links to the christological themes seen on the back and sides. Stylistically, the cross is without close parallel although its decoration is related to the Trinity Gospels which is dated to about 1020. Therefore a date around the middle of the eleventh century is possible.\nThe cross was  evidently intended both as a reliquary, presumably for an enshrined piece of the True Cross and as a pectoral cross. The shape, with its curious resemblance to a wheel-headed cross, particularly emphatic on the Agnus Dei side, is distinctly archaic for an eleventh-century date and suggests that the reliquary within could have been somewhat older than the ivory container which may have modelled its shape on the earlier piece.",

It surfaced again in 1966 when it was bought by the Museum from Sotheby's sale 22 March 1966, for \u00a340,000.\n\nHistorical significance: The iconography is complex but fully within the Anglo-Saxon tradition. All four sides are carved with versions of the Tree of Life, the vine scroll clustered with living creatures, which symbolises both the union of God and his creation, and of Christ and the Church.The image of the Agnus Dei surrounded by the four evangelist symbols, which unites both eucharistic and apocalyptic themes and so links to the christological themes seen on the back and sides. Stylistically, the cross is without close parallel although its decoration is related to the Trinity Gospels which is dated to about 1020. Therefore a date around the middle of the eleventh century is possible.",

The openwork construction was to reveal a metal reliquary housed inside. The shape, with its curious resemblance to a wheel-headed cross, particularly emphatic on the Agnus Dei side, is distinctly archaic for an eleventh-century date and suggests that the reliquary within could have been somewhat older than the ivory container which may have modelled its shape on the earlier piece.",
