Admiration for the Renaissance style in 19th-century mainland Europe was not shared in Britain until enthusiasts such as Prince Albert, Queen Victoria\u2019s consort, and Henry Cole, the first director of the V&A, promoted the style. English manufacturers often had to look abroad for skilled designers, such as Antoine Vechte, a renowned chaser of gold and silver from France who worked from 1849 for Hunt and Roskell, one of the most prestigious silversmiths of the Victorian period. \n\nThis coffee pot, bought by the South Kensington Museum (later the V&A) for \u00a340 from the Paris Exhibition of 1867, shows the museum\u2019s determination to acquire what it saw as the best contemporary design.",
