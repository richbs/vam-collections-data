He was closely associated with the St Ives artistic community, as the director of the print workshop in the Penwith Galleries and through his friendship with the St Ives artist, Bryan Pearce, whom he assisted with the production of his etchings.\n\nThe Victoria and Albert Museum holds two other prints by Roy Walker, both from the series 'Autocadaver'. This print - St Austell Storm - is one of Roy Walker's Cornish landscapes. He made a series of prints which featured aspects of the china-clay industry; this image shows the mountainous bulk of a spoil heap against a dramatic stormy sky. The image is simple, dramatic, elemental and a masterly example of printmaking.",
