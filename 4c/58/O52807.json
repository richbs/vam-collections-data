            "history_note": "The FPR 2 portable radio is the successor to the revolutionary Freeplay Portable Radio, FPR 1 (W.5-1996).  The wind-up mechanism, invented by Trevor Baylis, has been improved for this model to produce one hour of playtime (compared with 40 minutes for the FPR 1).  It has been restyled to be smaller, lighter, and visually more appealing.  The winding handle which operates the mechanism is less obvious, being concealed at the rear, as opposed to being exposed at the side as it is on the FPR 1.\n\nThe body of the FPR 2 was designed in-house by Baygen.  [John Hutchinson was the in-house designer at the Baygen Power Company.  He collaborated with Syzygy, a South African based product design company.]\n\nThis example was acquired as a gift from the manufacturer at the time of the product's UK launch.\n\nHistorical significance: The design of the FPR 2 evokes the 'classic' asymmetical streamlined sets of the 1930s-50s, for example the Tesla Talisman radio, c 1939 (W.28-1992) and the Fada Bullet Radio of 1940 (W.26-1992).  By imbuing the product with a fashionable nostalgia for earlier radio styling and disguising the innovative technology and winding handle by placing them inside and at the rear the manufacturer was attempting to move into the mainstream audio market.",

In the development of the FPR 2, internal mechanisms and styling were refined in attempt to take the product into the mainstream market.  It was marketed to ecologically-aware consumers in the developed world as the second generation Freeplay, perfect for outdoor leisure use and emergencies or power failures.",
