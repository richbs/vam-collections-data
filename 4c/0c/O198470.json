As such they demonstrate how clearly Albers understood the contribution modern technology could make to his explorations of visual perception.",

Kenneth Tyler, master printer at Gemini GEL described this process:\" The very precise line drawings of Albers dictated the use of mechanical means to assimilate his drawings into embossings. Investigations led to a system of programmed tape engraving. Collaboration between the artist, myself and an engineering programmer, established the exact profiles for each line and the proper thicknes of paper. The engineering programmer translated the original artist's drawing to a digital mylar tape. The tape then directed an automatic engraving mill, with specially  designed cutting heads, which cut into the printing plates the mirror image of the original drawings. Embossing was executed in a hydraulic forming machine. The use of heat and excessive pressure secured the image permanently into the mould made paper fibers.\"",
