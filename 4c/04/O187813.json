The owner put the end of one of her knitting needles into the long cone at the front while she was knitting, and looped the yarn through the hook at the bottom to keep it flowing smoothly.  There are two vertical bars on the back, through which she slid her belt, so that it would be held firmly in place whenever she had time for a little work.\n\nIt was bought as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
