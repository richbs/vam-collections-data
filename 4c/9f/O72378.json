The right shoulder is left bare by the robe which clings tightly to the flesh.   Other details include a flamed ushnisa (now damaged), an urna approximating to the shape of an inverted question mark, and extended earlobes.  The torana is formed by two spewing makaras and surmounted by a kirti-mukha.   The figure was cast separately from its lotus pedestal, the latter cast in one piece with the base.   Traces of encrusted carbonate matter indicate that the image has been buried in the ground for a long period.   On the front of the base is an inscription in Grantha characters which reads:\n\nGautamasva dharmam     Literally, \" the votive offering of Gautama (name of donor).\"",
