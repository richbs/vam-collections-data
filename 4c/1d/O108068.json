Three sides of the mosque have pillared colonnades built using the remains of 27 demolished Hindu and Jain temples, a fact recorded on the main eastern entrance to the mosque. \n\nAs can be seen here, the east side of the colonnade is three pillars deep (the north and south side being two pillars deep). The decoration on the Hindu/Jain iconography on the pillars is clearly visible showing lotus flowers, scrolling foliage and kalasa vessels overflowing with flowery creepers, this being a Brahmanical motif signifying abundance and overflowing prosperity.\n\nSee photograph number 53,218 for an external view of the same colonnade.",
