The roundel in the top left corner shows a putti chasing a butterfly, probably symbolising unrequited love. The roundel at the bottom centre shows a mother with a baby, representing maternal love. These roundels could be cut out and stuck to items such as gaming counters or snuffbox lids; they could also be used as designs for enamelled watchcases. They are late descendents of the popular emblem books of the 1500s and 1600s, in which sentimental and allegorical mottoes and verses were illustrated by similar woodcuts or engravings.",
