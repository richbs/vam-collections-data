Three cups are inverted and placed on a table and a small ball is put under one of them. The ball mysteriously disappears and reappears underneath one of the other cups. The cups are moved around on the table, lifted and replaced to show that the ball has vanished - then magically a ball is found under each cup. Some magicians have perfected the art of producing large objects, such as an apple, an orange or even a live bird, from beneath small cups.\n\nThese cups are of a type used by Indian magicians in the 17th and 18th centuries, and possibly earlier. Present day conjurers prefer larger metal cups, shaped like truncated cones.",
