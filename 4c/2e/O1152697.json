This unique range of little bears with an internal frame made up of metal plates, was first introduced in 1924 and continued to be made right through to the firm's demise in the late 1970s. Originally made as freebies as a publicity gimmick, the first miniature bears were known as the Piccolo range and were 9cm to 15cm in height. The very early 1920s examples had felt feet and paws, a design that was discontinued  in the 1930s.\n\nIn 1957, these little bears were reintroduced as the Talisman range in two sizes, 7cm and 9cm. Pandas were added in the 1950s to the blond, hazelnut, light brown and gold colours already used.",
