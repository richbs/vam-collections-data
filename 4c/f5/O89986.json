It is made of copper alloy covered with a thin layer of gold (gilt) but the style of the decoration is typical of brass wares made in Venice between 1500 and 1600. It was influenced by the objects Venetian merchants brought back to the city when trading with the Turkish and Arab empires that bordered the Mediterranean. \n\nThe decoration was almost always engraved (as here) and often covered the entire surface of an object. It featured the arabesque pattern seen here, with intricate scrolling motifs based on a stylised plant with a winding stem. Italian artists studied and copied the new arabesque style of decoration and by about 1550 it was beginning to influence designers all over Europe.",
