There, special objects were made to encourage alcohol consumption in a social and playful manner.\n\nThis goblet was specially crafted for such use. When the whistle is blown, both the windmill and the hands of the clock start turning. The drinker would have had to empty the entire contents of the glass before the windmill stopped turning. The price of failure would have been to drain the glass again, as many times as indicated by the clock. \n\nThe windmill mount of the goblet probably dates from around 1800 and must be a replacement for an earlier mount. Sometimes a goblet that had lost its foot was subsequently mounted in this manner. However, the engraving on the glass is stylistically contemporary with the glass itself and, since it is written so it can be read only when the glass is turned upside down, it appears that the glass was always intended to be fitted with a mount.",
