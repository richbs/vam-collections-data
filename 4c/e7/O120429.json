            "public_access_description": "W.232-1921\nThe inro is a container made up of tiers. Japanese men used them because the traditional Japanese garment, the kimono, had no pockets. From the late 1500s onwards, Japanese men wore the inro suspended from their sash by a silk cord and a netsuke (toggle). They originally used it to hold their seal and ink or a supply of medicines. However, it rapidly became a costly fashion accessory of little or no practical use. Most inro are rectangular with gently curving sides. \nLacquer was most commonly used in the manufacture of inro since it was highly suitable for storing medicines. Lacquer is the sap from the tree Rhus verniciflua that grows mainly in East Asia. After processing, it is applied in many thin layers to a base material.  The craft of lacquering, as well as making inro bodies, is highly complex, time-consuming and expensive. This inro is decorated with autumn plants in gold hiramakie (\u2018low sprinkled picture\u2019) lacquer. Makie is the most characteristic of Japanese lacquer techniques. It is a generic term for a number of related techniques. They all make use of gold, silver or coloured powders that are sprinkled on to wet lacquer before it hardens. The distinctive subject and techniques of decoration of this inro are characteristic of Kodaiji lacquerwork. This is a term used to describe objects made for the Kodaiji temple in the early seventeenth century, or those closely associated with the style. This inro is probably the oldest example in the V&A\u2019s collection.",
