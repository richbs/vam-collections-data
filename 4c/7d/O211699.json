Bass player Vicious was now heavily addicted to heroin, and acting out his dreams of violent anarchy. Singer Rotten, suffering from flu, was coughing up blood and disgusted by Vicious and McLaren, played his last date with the band on 14 January at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco. After one song he addressed the audience directly with \"Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?\" and left the stage.\n\nOf Reid's original designs for the Sex Pistols, this t-shirt only uses his ransom-note style logo. This t-shirt is designed, rather, to show a wearer's allegiance to this specific musical subculture, and advertise that the wearer attended one of the few and infamous American Sex Pistols gigs.",
