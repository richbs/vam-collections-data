It was probably produced with the tourist market in mind, especially since Columbine is standing in front of a Venetian gondola post.  Since it is designed on one plane, to attract our attention from the front, it was probably made for mantelpiece decoration, with another of Harlequin as a pair.\n\nColumbine was a character from the Italian knockabout comedy known as the Commedia dell'Arte which flourished in Europe from the 16th to the 18th centuries. Columbina, as she was known in Italy, was the lady's maid who became known as Columbine in France and England.  In her native country she had gone by other names including Franceschina, Smeraldina, Oliva, Nespola, Spinetta, Ricciolina, Corallina, Diamantina and Lisetta.  Her relationship with Harlequin was the central romantic interest in Commedia plays, showing Columbine in love with the rascal Harlequin but always aware of his faults and attempting to change him. Columbine's costume was traditionally designed as a counterpart to Harlequin's, the material a patchwork of multi-coloured diamond shapes.",
