Born Charles Sherwood Stratton in Bridgeport, Connecticut, in 1838, Tom Thumb was 'discovered' at four years old by the American showman P.T. Barnum. Barnum trained him to sing and dance, exhibited him at his American Museum in New York and marketed him successfully throughout America and Europe. \n\nTom Thumb's wedding and reception at the Metropolitan Hotel received massive press coverage and the couple were given lavish gifts from socially prominent New Yorkers. Barnum marketed several souvenirs of the occasion including this locket, individual daguerrotype photographs, and a pamphlet which detailed the lives, courtship, and wedding of Stratton and Warren and reproduced lengthy excerpts from newspaper articles about their wedding.  The photographs in this locket include those of their bridesmaid - Lavinia's sister Minnie, and their best man George Washington Morrison 'Commodore' Nutt. Tom Thumb and Lavinia never had children, but curiously borrowed a baby for these photographs.",
