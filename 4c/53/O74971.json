            "public_access_description": "This portrait by Thomas Flatman of his close friend Charles Beale, husband of the artist Mary Beale and father of the miniature painter Charles Beale Jr, is typical of Flatman's distinctive painting technique. His brushwork is often thought of as dry and scratchy, and the overall effect unsympathetic and harsh. This has often been interpreted as a failure of technique--using brushes that were too fine--and a reflection of his semi-amateur rather than professional status as a miniaturist. \n\nFlatman was a lawyer and poet and was not dependent on his art for a living. However, he may have intended the effect, deliberately coarsening his brushstrokes to give a scratched, quick result. The purpose would have been to avoid the professional norm of smooth and blended brushwork and the impression of a lingering vanity given by more finished products. Flatman was in effect drawing attention to the techniques and materials of his art, deliberately aiming for a form of rough, graphic honesty. This portrait of Beale is typical of Flatman's unflattering style, in which he neither ignores nor disguises Beale's three warts.\n\nThe miniature is inscribed on the back, giving it a date of 1660.  The miniature is however also dated on the front, lower left, 1664.  It is catalogue number 117 in John Murdoch \u201cSeventeenth-century English Miniatures in the Collection of the Victoria & Albert Museum\u201d (1997). (Murdoch incorrectly notes the date on the front as \"1660\").",

Inscribed on the back in ink: <i>Amico suo an[te omnesJ 1 charissimo Mro Carolo Beal[ o ] Ihanc sua[ m ] effigiem T Flatman. /D.D.D./ Aug. 3. 1660.</i> 'D.D.D.', 'Dono dedit et dedicavit', or occasionally 'Dat dicet et dedicat', is formulaic on gifts, prizes and other objects presented formally to the recipient. The whole dedication here translates literally: 'to his own friend most dear before all, Master Charles Beale this his own likeness. T. Flatman gave and dedicated it as a gift, 3 August 1660.' \n\n<b>Frame</b> Nineteenth- or twentieth-century silver-gilt locket with convex back and rounded sides, the shallowly convex glass held in a bezel by its bevelled edge; the hanger of teardrop form made from wire of triangular section, bifurcating and turning back into reversed loops on each side of the hanger before going into diminishing spirals of seven turns. Engraved on the back with a not wholly accurate transcription of the dedication above, including a reading of the date as 1668. A label of the Joseph Collection inscribed: <i>26/ Thomas Flatman/portrait of himself.\n</i>\n<b>Provenance:</b> Acquired by S S Joseph from an unrecorded source; Mrs Emma Joseph, his widow, by whom presented to the Museum, May 1941. \n\n<b>Exhibited:</b> The Seventeenth Century in Europe, Rome, Council of Europe, Winter 1956-7, no. 104; Geffrye Museum 1975-6 (the London showing only), ex-catalogue, but a typed insert gives it as 60A; see also p. 20 and repro. p. 54. \n\n<b>Literature:</b>W Armstrong, Art in Great Britain and Ireland (1909), p. 54; Long 1929, p. 155 (apparently as a portrait of Richard Cromwell); Reynolds 1947, p. 67, pI. lIE; Reynolds 1952, p. 75; Foskett 1963, pl. 44; Foskett 1972, vol. I, p. 273; <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 22; Murdoch 1981, p. 151, fig. 162; Bayne-Powell 1985, p. 84; Reynolds 1988, p. 69, fig. 35. \n\nWhen it first appeared the miniature was identified as a portrait of Richard Cromwell, but while it was in the Joseph Collection its similarity to the other early Flatmans of this type (see Cat. No. 120 [Dyce 95]) led to its identification with the others as a self-portrait. Carl Winter, in the course of his work on the genuine self-portrait, Cat. No. 130[P.79-1938], began to sort out the muddle of the supposed self-portraits, and thus, when the present miniature arrived at the Museum, he was immediately able to catalogue it as a portrait of Charles Beale. Graham Reynolds clarified the whole subject in the <i>Burlington Magazine</i>, (1) relating the confusion to 'the ambiguous Latinity of the inscription' on the back of this and the Woodforde in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge. Flatman's Latin is also condemned by Robert Bayne-Powell, who comments on the <i>Woodforde</i>: 'Confusion has arisen through the use of the word \"sui\" in the inscription on the reverse. This should mean \"of himself\" showing that the miniature is a self-portrait. However, on the back of this miniature, Flatman wrote a similar inscription, again using the word \"sui\" where he should have used the word \"ejus\".'\n \nHaving had the benefit of consultation with Ronald Lightbown, however, I have less difficulty in understanding 'suam' (the letter is definitely an 'a' with a nasalisation stroke over it) as referring to Beale - 'this his own likeness'. Lightbown noticed nothing unconventional in terms of seventeenth-century Latin usage in the inscription, and it would indeed have been strange for scholars such as Flatman, Beale and Woodforde to need the red pen taken to their work. \n\nLightbown also agreed that the date in the inscription was 1660, not as previously read 1664 (and not Aug. 13 but Aug. 3). A date thus four years earlier is much more comfortable in terms of Flatman's stylistic and technical development; furthermore, in terms of Beale's apparent age, 1660, when Beale was twenty-nine, seems better than 1664, when he was thirty-three. Walsh and Jeffree comment that Flatman 'has meticulously depicted his three characteristic warts'. (2) Visible also is the fine line of a soft moustache, perhaps intended to disguise the largest of the warts on the left of the upper lip. The lips themselves are full, the lower lip casting a distinct shadow in the recess of the chin. Beneath the line of the jaw, there is an incipient double chin. The eyebrows are strongly marked in a flat arch, and the brow is high but quite narrow. With the additional marks of two years bureaucratic infighting at the Patents Office,' these features seem to be again evident in the similar miniature, Cat. No. 120. \n\n1 Reynolds 1947, p. 67. \n2 Walsh and Ieffree, 1975-6, no. 60A. \n3 See biographical note on Charles Beale 'the Younger', pp. 251-2.\" \n<u>Victoria and Albert Museum, Department of Engraving, Illustration and Design and Department of Paintings, Accessions 1941</u>, London: HMSO, 1954.\nThe full text of the record is as follows:\n\n<b>'FLATMAN, Thomas (1635-1688)\n</b>\nMiniature portrait of Charles Beale the Elder (died after 1681), husband of Mary Beale (1632-1697)..<i>\nSigned with monogram and dated</i> TF/ 1664 <i>Inscribed on the back</i> Amico suo ante omnes/ charissimo Mro Carolo Beale/ hanc sui Effigiem T.
