As she describes it: 'Last night\u2019s British premiere of Richard Curtis\u2019s new \u201cfeelgood\u201d movie, \u201cLove Actually\u201d, starring Hugh Grant, offers a welcome respite from gloomy weather and politics. Ironically, in Hugh Grant\u2019s romantic role as British Prime Minister, he stands up to the arrogant American president in one of the movie\u2019s liveliest scenes. In reality, President Bush is due to arrive in London for a State visit and he and Blair appear to be closer than ever, despite public disapproval over Iraq on both sides of the Atlantic.'\n\n'Marf' drew daily topical cartoons for the Evening Standard between March 2002 and August 2005, moving to the Londoner's Diary page in August 2003. The drawings cover key political and social issues of the period, providing a vivid and often hilarious response to the main news of the day. The Evening Standard is London's only evening newspaper, publishing up to five editions a day. In Marf's own words: 'The cartoonist needs to keep up with the rapid pace of event.'",
