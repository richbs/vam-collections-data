Mather in the Town Hall, Kinross, probably in about 1941 or 1942.  It was given to the museum with a collection of posters and scrapbooks compiled by him, relating to wartime entertainment that he organised, first with the Kinross Home Guard when he was only 19, and later with ENSA, the Entertainments Division of the British Forces.\n\nJohn C. Mather went on to become a producer of several war-time revues, and to work in the theatre after the war. In 1941 he was a member of the Kinross Home Guard which was founded in Great Britain in May 1940 as the Local Defence Volunteers, when there was a real risk of invasion in Great Britain.  Their members were those who were either too old or too young to join the regular forces, or who worked in so-called reserved occupations.  Winston Churchill changed their name to the Home Guard in August 1940. The Kinross Home Guard had various committees which organised activities including the Dance Committee, the Boxing Committee and the Concert Party.",
