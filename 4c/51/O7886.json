Under the upholstery, the chair is stamped with the numerals XXIV, suggesting that it was part of a large set.\n\nPeople\nSir Godfrey Vassal Webster (1789-1836) inherited Battle Abbey in 1810 and began an expensive programme of restoration in appropriate medieval style. One of his unlucky creditors was George Bullock (?1782-1818), who supplied furniture that included this chair, for Battle Abbey. Sir Godfrey's cheque for \u00a31000, made out to Bullock, was bounced by Sir Godfrey's bank. Finally Sir Godfrey, an inveterate gambler, moved abroad to escape his creditors, where he died in 1836, leaving his widow to settle his debts.\n\nPlace\nBattle Abbey was founded by William the Conqueror on the site of the Battle of Hastings in 1066 and was rebuilt by 1500. Sir Godfrey Webster's programme of restoration, 1812-1822, included the reroofing of the medieval Great Hall and work on the former Abbot's house. He commissioned appropriate furniture, including a set of these chairs, some of which were in the Ante Room and others in the Dining Room in 1832.",

It was sold by Battle Abbey Settled Estates at Christies 23/10/1980. It was reupholstered in February 1988. Another chair from the same set is in Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery.\n\nHistorical significance: The chair is designed in the 17th century style, which was known in the early 19th century as the 'Tudor' style. The design was illustrated in Ackermann's <font -u>'Repository of Arts'</font> (1817) as a library chair, 'for a bookroom in a mansion built in the seventeenth century'. There is a tracing by Thomas Wilkinson of the original design in Birmingham Museum.",
