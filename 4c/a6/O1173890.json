Both began their careers as designers and were responsible for executing the costumes after their own designs.  The Gang dominated comedy at the London Palladium in the 1930s, switching to the Victoria Palace in 1947.  Their final show was Young in Heart which opened in 1960.  The Crazy Gang was actually three different double acts (Flanagan and Allen, Naughton and Gold, Nervo and Knox), though by the time they moved to the Victoria Palace, Chesney Allen had retired.  In 1956 'Monsewer' Eddie Gray rejoined the Gang (he had been with them in the 1930s). From 1951 they were also assisted by Peter Glaze. Nervo and Knox were famous as acrobatic parodists whose speciality act was a cod ballet sequence, and it was probably their influence that led to the 'drag' sequences which featured in the Victoria Palace shows.  Bonn and MacKenzie's costumes for the 'Royal Ascot' scene parody Cecil Beaton's designs for the Ascot sequence in the musical My Fair Lady, which was running at Drury Lane.",
