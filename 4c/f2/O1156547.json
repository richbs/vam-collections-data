His imaginative  lavish costumes and sets, informed by historical styles, proved especially effective in the operas of Mozart, Rossini and Richard Strauss. He also designed the covers of the programmes, using variations on his designs for that season's productions. This preliminary design, for the 1959 programme, features the rose from Richard Strauss's Der Rosenkavalier, shown in naturalistic colours. The finished design (S.6498-2009) uses a similarly shaped rose but shows it in the silver required in the opera. On the back of this design are the words 'carpet design', which suggests that Messel may have been considering other uses for this image.\n\nOliver Messel (1904-1978) was Britain\u2019s leading theatre designer throughout the 1930s, \u201840s and \u201850s, mastering every aspect of entertainment - ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue - as well working in interior decoration and textile design. His lavish, painterly and romantic concepts were perfectly in tune with the times and earned him an international reputation.  By 1960, however, that style was becoming unfashionable, and Messel gradually abandoned theatre and built a new career designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.",
