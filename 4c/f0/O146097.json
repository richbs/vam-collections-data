The direction of the diagonal stitching is changed between and inside motifs to emphasise the lustre of the silk thread.\nWhite ground with a series of four narrow/extended lozenges, two in yellow and two in light blue, forming a diagonal lattice.  Each lozenge is infilled with extended S-motifs in dark blue or light green, both with white and pink details.  In the space created by this grid of lozenges, there is a more flattened lozenge form in pink or beige, each having 4 'arms' in light blue or faded red to form an anti-clockwise 'whirl'. there is a border along all four sides in light green with a static repeat pattern of a polygonal shape in light blue, white, yellow and faded red alternating with a small pointed cartouche form in faded red.  One section shows the stitching was inaccurate and so the direction was changed. A narrow band of small hexagonal shapes in white, beige and some faded red and light blue, separated by diagonal bars of faded red and yellow forms the inner and outer border edging.\nEmbroidery threads: 2S silk; black, white, light green, yellow, light blue, dark blue, faded red, beige.\nBacking: blue silk.\nFacing: striped silk: white, red, green, black, yellow.\nInter-lining: printed cotton with small floral sprigs on a light brown ground.",
