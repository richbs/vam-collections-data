It remains particularly close to its regional, peasant, origins and is one of the five key Polish National Dances of which the other four are the 'Polonez', the 'Krakowiak', the 'Mazur' and the 'Kujawiak'.\n\nA version of the \u2018Oberek\u2019 known as the Oberek Opoczynski appears to have been choreographed by Dr. Morley Leyton who founded and directed the American based group the Janosik Polish Dancers in 1971. This company have worked closely with the Polish State Folk Dance and Song Ensemble, Mazowsze. The Mazowsze company  was established by a decree issued by the Polilsh Ministry of Culture and Art on the 8th of November 1948. The decree ordered Professor Tadeusz Sygietynski to create a folk group that would maintain regional artistic traditions and the traditional folk repertoire of songs and dances of the Masovian countryside. The group was intended to protect this folk tradition from destruction and encapsulate its diversity, beauty and richness. Mazowsze staged its premiere performance of regional songs and dances in the Polish Theatre in Warsaw on the 6th of November 1950.",
