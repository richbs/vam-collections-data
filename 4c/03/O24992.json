The most spectacular of these was Borobudor, designed as a three-dimensional mandala (cosmological diagram).  This and other monuments in the region were richly decorated with narrative reliefs and free-standing sculptures.  This head is probably from a large scale seated Buddha image in this region.  Early in the 9th century the Sailendras were displaced by the Sanjaya dynasty who, whilst allowing Buddhism to continue to flourish, instigated a Hindu renaissance symbolised by the construction of the great temple complex at Prambanan.  The region fell into neglect with the move of the ruling houses to east Java in the 10th century.",
