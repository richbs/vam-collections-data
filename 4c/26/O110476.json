From about 800 they bore the image of the crucified Christ and became known as crucifixes. By about 1100 the imagery of European crosses had become established. It usually included the symbols of the four Evangelists (Matthew, Mark, Luke and John), often with the Virgin Mary and St John flanking the figure of Christ crucified.\n\nThis very large cross was clearly made for processional use. Enamelled plaques and embossed figures show scenes from the life of Christ. On the front are the Crucifixion and Resurrection of Christ. On the back are the Nativity, the Annunciation and the Flight into Egypt.",

Crosses were also carried in procession before a service. In early centuries these were hand-held, later replaced by more visible crosses raised on staffs.\n\nBoth altar and processional crosses were generally made of precious or gilt metal, or ivory, and decorated with gems.
