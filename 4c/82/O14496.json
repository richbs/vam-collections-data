The decoration illustrats a popular love story, The West Chamber, each of the panels, arranged in four rows, showing an important episode. It was made during a time of social stability and prosperity. The 'Rebellion of the Three Feudatories' led by General Wu Sangui against the Emperor Kangxi had finally been crushed. The rebellion had completely stopped porcelain production at Jingdezhen from 1674 to 1676, but in 1680 a group of state officials was sent to re-establish the imperial ceramic factory, and with the end of civil war foreign trade was resumed.\n\nKangxi, who ruled from 1662 to 1722, was the longest reigning emperor in the country's history. Under his rule China's relationship with Europe was also at its best. The fact that a Jesuit missionary, P\u00e8re d'Entrecolles (1664-1741), was able to observe porcelain production first-hand at Jingdezhen in 1712 and again in 1722 clearly demonstrates that Europeans were allowed greater freedom than at later times. \n\nA large number of tall vases made between1685 and 1720 were shipped to Europe, where 'oriental porcelain rooms' were in fashion. The shape of this vase is not one produced specifically for the European market, but several such vases were acquired for the 'Japanese Palace' porcelain collections of Augustus the Strong, Elector of Saxony and King of Poland, before 1721 (see p.90). This highlights the fact that the division between 'export' and 'domestic' wares is not always straightforward and clear cut.",

The rebellion had completely stopped porcelain production at Jingdezhen from 1674 to 1676, but in 1680 a group of state officials was sent to re-establish the imperial ceramic factory, and with the end of civil war foreign trade was resumed. \n\nKangxi, who ruled from 1662 to 1722, was the longest reigning emperor in the country's history. Under his rule China's relationship with Europe was also at its best. The fact that a Jesuit missionary, P\u00e8re d'Entrecolles (1664-1741), was able to observe porcelain production first-hand at Jingdezhen in 1712 and again in 1722 clearly demonstrates that Europeans were allowed greater freedom than at later times. \n\nA large number of tall vases made between1685 and 1720 was shipped to Europe, where 'oriental porcelain rooms' were in fashion. The shape of this vase is not one produced specifically for the European market, but several such vases were acquired for the 'Japanese Palace' porcelain collections of Augustus the Strong, Elector of Saxony and King of Poland, before 1721 (see p.90). This highlights the fact that the division between 'export' and 'domestic' wares is not always straightforward and clear cut.",
