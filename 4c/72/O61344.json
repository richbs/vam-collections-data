The legs are bevelled inside and have a black quarter-round beading set into the outer edge.  The case has a hinged lid with metal folding struts each side.  In the lid is a separate hinged writing-leaf (with a catch), which comes down to cover the internal fittings in the lower part.  These fittings include five hinge-lidded compartments and four open wells in each corner, one of which still contains a glass pounce-pot.  Loop handles at the sides.  Flat metal key-escutcheon of fancy 'winged' shape.  The marquetry is of a striped wood, applied in quarters with banding on the case, and in chevrons on the legs.  Laburnum (or possibly olive) wood.  All edges have strings of a dark wood, probably ebony, inset.\n\nIn the light of research showing that 'laburnum' in late 17th-century cabinet-making was usually cocus-wood, the identification of the wood used here is far from certain. Another possibility is yew-wood. (LMW, 26/2/2004)",
