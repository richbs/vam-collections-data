In the Abbasid period (AD750-1258) fabrics, called tiraz, were made in present day Iraq and Egypt. The word came to mean honorific robes with woven or embroidered inscriptions. Text from the Koran was embroidered across the fabric with a line of geometric shapes above that were probably for decoration. Text might also include information such as the name of the reigning caliph, place of production and date.",
