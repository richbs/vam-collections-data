It was designed by the pioneering Swiss architect, Le Corbusier (1887-1965). He help to define twentieth century architecture and some of his most farmous works were such private residences for wealthy patrons. As an expression of the 'International Style', a trend of the early twentieth century which usually eschewed ornamentation in favour of functionality, the Villa Savoye is exemplary. The white walls and horizontal bands of windows were typical of Le Corbusier's Modernist approach.\n\nThe model also displays the engineering principles of this 'International Style', showing how the design uses frame construction, rather than load-bearing walls. This allowed architects to leave out walls at ground level, thereby raising the position of the building and improving views. Its clean lines and functionality are also true to to Le Corbusier's notion of the house as \"a machine for living\".",
