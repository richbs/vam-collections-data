No. 141. She wrote in addition: 'The sitter wears a frilled cap supported on a wired framework. The hair is similar [to Cat. No. 141] except that the back hair is longer. On the whole I would prefer not to use the term \"fontange\" even though nowadays it is generally understood to mean a headdress such as this. In Mary Evelyn, <i>The Fop Dictionary</i>, c.1680, pub. 1684 ... [fontange is defined as] \"the Top-Knot so called from Mademoiselle de Fontange; (1) one of the French King's Mistresses who first wore it\". The front frill of the cap worn by this sitter would probably be supported by a [cage] of wire to raise the Dress (Head-dress).\" Ginsburg thus inclined to a somewhat earlier dating than Reynolds's interpretation of her advice suggests, perhaps 1685-90. \n\nThe sitter has the look of another neighbour or acquaintance of the artist. \n\n1 Mile de Fontange flourished at Court c. 1678-80. \n2 Minute to Graham Reynolds, December 1974; department file.\u201d\n\nEmma Rutherford and Dr Bendor Grosvenor, <u>Warts and All.
