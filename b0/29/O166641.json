In doing so, he laid the foundations of modern photography.Calvert Richard Jones learned of these developments in 1839 through a neighbour, who was a cousin of Talbot. Jones made many pictures in the West of England and South Wales, where he lived. He also travelled widely, making photographs on the continent. Jones' work stands out in the early development of photography because he was one of the first to apply a schooled artist's eye to the medium.\n\nThe fa\u00e7ade of Rheola House is pattern of light and dark dominated by horizontal lines of shadow, motifs which Jones often introduced into his compositions. The horizontal lines in this photograph are created by the eves of the roof and a veranda. A wide mass of ivy on the bay window visually links to the carefully composed foreground group of women with a wheelchair. The vertical lines of the standing figures are reflected by the foliage hung veranda supports and their shadows against the house.",
