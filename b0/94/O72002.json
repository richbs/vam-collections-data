Peter Lanyon (1918-1964) made it under the instruction of Warren Mackenzie (b. 1924), an artist and ceramicist from the USA, where the process was already in use for artists' prints. Lanyon's method of  washing off the preliminary stencil colours with turpentine left the translucent stain that forms the background of this image. The title Underground refers to the mines and shafts, burial grounds and subterranean caves that Lanyon, as a Cornishman, was deeply aware formed another kind of space beneath the free and open surface of Cornwall's landscape in the remote southwest of Britain.",
