Wood-engraving, corrected with white, 8 x 5 (19.9 x 12.7 cm) E.916-1971 Bequeathed by Sir Paul Fildes, O.B.E., F.R.S. in memory of his father, the Artist Note: Controversy has surrounded the designer of this cover. It is clear that C.A. Collins made the original sketch for it, but was prevented, through illness, from completing it. The cover was certainly redrawn, but whether the second hand was that of Sir Luke Fildes, who provided the rest of the illustrations to the novel, or of one of the engraver's draughtsmen, has not been irrefutably settled. The donor did not believe that his father had anything to do with the cover. A complete set of the parts, wrapped in this cover, is in the Department of Prints and Drawings, E.972-1971 Literature: For the argument in favour of Fildes having touched up and altered Collin's cover: C.F.Lehmann-Haupt, 'Studies on <u>Edwin Drood</u>', <u>The Dickensian</u>, no xxx[illeg.], London, 1935, pp. 299-302.
