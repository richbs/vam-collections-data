            "public_access_description": "This bronze statuette 'Perseus Arming' is made by Sir Alfred Gilbert in the late 19th century in England. It represents the nude figure of Perseus with a winged helmet and a sword in his left hand. He is looking down at a winged sandal which he has just strapped to his right foot.\n\nGilbert wanted to portray the Greek mythological hero Perseus as a 'mere mortal' preparing for combat. He saw the subject as foreshadowing his own life and work. It was exhibited at the Paris Salon, and received an honourable mention, which encouraged the young artist to 'go on writing my own history by symbol'.\n\nIn Greek mythology Perseus was the son of Zeus and Danae and one of the archetypal heroes in Greek mythology. He defeated various monsters, one of them Medusa, whom he beheaded.Perseus is depicted either as the typical hero, young, beardless and naked (sometimes with a short cloak), or he is dressed as a warrior in armour. He holds a curved sword, a gift from Mercury and a polished shield given by his protector Minerva. He wears winged sandals.\n\nSir Alfred Gilbert (1854 - 1934) was a famous British sculptor of the late 19th century. He was also a medallist, goldsmith and draughtsman. He was known for his inventiveness and characteristically used various materials in the same work. Upon his many commissions for monuments and memorials is the celebrated Eros figure as part of the Shaftsbury memorial (1885-1893) on Piccadilly Circus.",

Brocklehurst in the archives of the Department of Western Art at the Ashmolean Museum. Gilbert suggested that the signature was evidence that the bronze was the work of pirates and pointed out that he never signed his work in that way. He said that he had written to the newspapers to express his indignation that such a work should be in the Victoria and Albert Museum. There is also a minute from Eric Maclagan in the Victoria and Albert Museum archives, dated 2 June 1911, concerning a visit by Herbert Wheeler, a friend of Gilbert, who commented that the Perseus Arming and other bronzes in the collection were commercial copies. Maclagan writes, 'I understand from Mr Watts that Gilbert himself called one Sunday afternoon four or five years ago  and made a similar complaint particularly repudiating the Perseus.' [Registered File VA/150/7, Departments: Architecture and Sculpture, Inventory Questions] However, Nicholas Penny has argued that there is no difference in quality between this version and the authorised version in the Ashmolean.\n\nIn the collection of Alfred Higgins at the time of his death.
