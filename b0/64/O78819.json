T.294:1-1975) fitted out with equipment for painting on velvet. They were supplied by Reeves & Woodyer, 'Superfine Colour Preparers to Her Majesty, His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales & Royal Family'. The three bottles are labelled 'Ackermann's brilliant carmine', 'W H Edwards's lilac purple', and 'W H Edwards's sunflower yellow'. The other contents of the box include bowls for mixing colours and holding water, a tiny bone palette and brush rest, pairs of dividers and pincers, and brushes, as well as small slabs of paint in many colours. The box contains a printed endorsement from the manufacturers with the ink date 'February 12th 1814'.\n\nOwnership & Use\nThe practice of painting designs onto silk velvet was an outlet for the amateur artist, to create panels that she could then make into decorative objects with her needle. The effect of the paint colours on the pile of the velvet gave the pattern a density and texture quite different from the crispness and delicacy of painted taffeta and satin, which bacame popular in the later 18th century.",
