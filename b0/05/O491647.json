Kitchin.\nThe lacquer on the small flat panels was curling badly and much of the mother-of-pearl over the whole object was lifting. Beeswax and resin mixed with titanium white was used as an adhesive. The surplus wax was removed with white spirit, and the whole screen polished with cosmoloid in shellsol A. The adhesive was coloured white in order not to discolour the mother-of-pearl.\nNot recoquised as Chinese by Wang Shixiang 9/1983: Possibly a Ryukyuan object? Compare the tables and screensm nos. 65-68  in ''Ryukyu Shikk, no Biten''(Okinawa, Urasoe, City 1983)\nOpinion of James Watt, Metropolitan Museum 6.8.1990: Would accept as Chinese, perhaps to be dated 1575-1650.",
