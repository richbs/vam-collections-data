Binns in the early 20th century of performers including Henry Irving, Dan Leno, George Robey and Albert Chevalier. As well as theatrical subjects, Binns drew cartoons of political figures, and was associated with two predominant caricaturists of this period, Sir Francis Carruthers Gould and Harry Furniss.\n\nThis is the larger of two versions of Henry Irving (1838-1905), the actor-manager of the Lyceum theatre, as Richard III, one of his favourite roles which he first played in January 1877. He played him as a blustering bully, or as Clement Scott described it: 'a truculent tyrant, who stamped about the stage in scarlet doublet and flapping russet boots, and black ringlet wig and bushy eyebrows, supposed to symbolize in their hue the darkness of his deeds of villainy'. Scott thought his Richard was Irving's greatest triumph as an actor: 'intelligent, carefully wrought and convincing'.",
