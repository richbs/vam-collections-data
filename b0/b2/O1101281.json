Willoughby Wallace</i> <sub><i>C.M.G</i>\n</sub>\nA modified form of Vidal's process was the basis for the production of Photochrom prints.  These were marketed widely in the late 1880s, 1890s and 1900s are were collected, as in this case, by travellers of antiquarian persuasions.  At first sight resembling true colour photographs, they can be distinguished by the mechanical nature of the printing, seen when the print is examined with a magnifier.  There is also the characteristic caption in gold lettering along the base of the print, with a serial number and a 'P.Z.' - for Photochrom, Zurich.\nThis example is from a group of 800 photographs collected by Canon Wallace of Bristol in the 1870s and 1880s.  His collection included photographs of drawings of the cathedrals of England and Wales, of modern buildings like the Eiffel Tower, together with views of the Swiss Alps and subjects of interest to tourists such as pigeons in Venice and a bullfight in San Sebastian.\"",
