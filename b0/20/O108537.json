The success of a set design cannot be judged until it is translated into three dimensions by the set painters or builders. The success of a set design cannot be judged until it is translated into three dimensions by the set painters or builders. \nIt is often difficult from a set drawing to see how the design will be realised.  The designer usually conveys an impression which is then translated into detailed scale drawings and set models. Some designers build their own set models, others are realised by specialist model makers or set builders.\nIn this design for the final scene of Romeo and Juliet, the designer uses the sombre colours to marry into the melancholy tragic atmosphere.  The sketch of the double colonnade with staircases gives a variety of levels, which is necessary to create interesting crowd scenes.  The townscape indicates the greater picture - the play is not just a personal tragedy but a tragedy of civic breakdown.",
