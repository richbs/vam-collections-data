ISBN 1851773088.\nThis exceptionally well-preserved picture, which retains its fresh original colours, is a fine example of professional English embroidery of about 1660. The panel depicts an early moment in the biblical story of Susanna and the Elders, from the Apocrypha. Susanna, a beautiful and righteous wife, walked each afternoon with her handmaidens in the garden adjoining her wealthy husband's house. Two Elders, newly appointed as judges, watched her in the garden every day and began to lust after her. The Elders waited for an opportune moment to take advantage of her, finding it one hot day when Susanna decided to bathe and sent her maids to the house for bath oils. The Elders shut the garden gates and ordered Susanna to lie with them or they would falsely accuse her of adultery. Despite their power as judges, Susanna chose the virtuous course, rejecting the Elders, and was condemned to death upon their testimony to the people's assembly. She was saved by Daniel, in whom the Lord - hearing Susanna's cries of innocence - instilled the spirit of truth.\nThe details of this picture are unusual. The story of Susanna is one of the few biblically justifiable opportunities to depict female nudity, and it is rare to find a composition of the story in which Susanna is fully clothed. Nor is she commonly posed with her maids; on the contrary, Susanna is almost always portrayed in a suggestive manner, flanked by the Elders. (It has been suggested by art historian Mary Garrard that depictions of Susanna in which she does not invite the Elders' advances were sometimes the work of women artists, who would have been more sympathetic to her plight and perhaps given greater emphasis to her chastity.)\nBiblical stories recounting the deeds of virtuous women were a popular choice for English needlework pictures in this period. They were mostly made by young needlewomen (girls from age eight could already be accomplished in such work), for whom biblical heroines like Susanna represented the virtues of chastity, faith, and sacrifice.\nThe amateur needleworker did not ordinarily create her own designs. The figures, birds, animals, insects, architectural elements, and trees and flowers were usually copied from woodcuts and engravings (mostly Flemish) by professional pattern drawers and print sellers, who would transfer line drawings on fabric for the needleworker to embroider. It is thought that this elaborate and refined piece is by a professional embroiderer; indeed, it has decorative elements - notably its ornate wreath \"frame\" - similar to those found in a surviving signed work by the London \"broderer\" John Nelham. An oval wreath of silk-wrapped parchment, very like the one in this \"Susanna and the Elders,\" also occurs on a signed and dated (1673) beaded jewel case - in the Victoria and Albert Museum's collection - worked by the very skilled amateur Martha Edlin (English, born 1660).\nThis embroidered picture was bequeathed to the Museum in 1954 by Sir Frederick Richmond, together with other outstanding examples of seventeenth-century English embroidery. The Richmond collection was one of the finest in private hands, exemplifying the growing appreciation for English needlework among collectors. Such gifts or bequests from private collectors - complementing purchases made with public funds - have played a major role, especially in the twentieth century, in the Museum's collection development in the field of English material.\n\nLit.
