They originated in the 1440s with the desire to reproduce coins and hardstone engravings from ancient Greece and Rome. Some were made as collector's pieces, to be viewed and displayed in private, and others for practical or devotional purposes, such as decorations for caskets, ink-stands and paxes. \n\nBelli (1468-1546) was born into a respected Vicentine family. He trained as a goldsmith and developed considerable skills in engraving crystals and dies. For Pope Clement VII he created his masterpiece, a crystal casket with 24 scenes from the life of Christ, now in the Palazzo Pitti in Florence.\nBelli was strongly influenced by Raphael and Michelangelo.\nHe had a facility to work very quickly, and Vasari noted that Belli had flooded the world with his works. \nBelli spent the most important part of his career in Rome, working for two successive popes.  Almost all of his bronze plaquettes are cast from his engravings in rock crystal or hardstone.",
