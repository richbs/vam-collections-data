In 1928 he began designing dresses using the same 3-dimensional constructive approach found in millinery. James referred to himself as a 'sartorial structural architect'. \n\nThis hat is made of one piece of grosgrain silk fabric which is cut and folded in an origami style to create a peaked hat with a crown which flows into a high blunt brim. It came straight from the studio of Charles James into the V&A collections and retains a paper label stitched to the side, which reads PLEASE DO NOT UNPICK SEAMS OR STITCHES, presumably a warning to those working with fabrics in his studio.The hat is a great example of James's structural approach and his talent for creating volume out of flat materials.",
