I, pl. xxvii, no. 1; Reynolds 1975, no. 5, pl. 18 (dated c.1680); Reynolds 1988, p. 78. \n\nThe dating is crucial to the interpretation of the inscription, which could, on the face of it, specify either the artist or the sitter. If it specifies the sitter, there could again be two candidates, Susannah - Penelope herself or her mother-in-law, Elizabeth Rosse (b.c. 1620) . As to the date, Madeleine Ginsburg commented in December 1974: \n\nThis is very confusing to date from the hairstyle; the curls at ear level, the shoulder length ringlet, the hair curling softly towards the face, seem similar rather to the coiffures of the 1640s and 1650s ... After 1660 hairstyles seem subject to swifter change than in the previous decades, and quite soon the hair begins to be massed, horizontally, at ear level. There are discrepancies with an early dating; the parting is not clearly defined but blurred by an overall curliness and there is the' quiff\" on the forehead which one would not expect before 1680. Since even a 1660 date would be inconsistent with an attribution to Susan Penelope Rosse who was born 1652 [ sic] I would very tentatively suggest that this miniature was a later copy of an earlier likeness and that the inconsistencies are due to a lack of comprehension of mid-century styling. In so far as I can say from the sketchy outline of the dress, the sleeve with 'vandyked' edge suggests picturesque rather than contemporary fashion. (1)\n\nReynolds annotated the point about the' quiff': 'I think this is crucial', and took the view that the image was of c.1680, the inconsistencies of coiffure and costume being probably due to lack of finish, He added: 'It is of Mrs Rosse in all likelihood.' \n\nAlthough there is no intrinsic reason, of expression or pose, or obvious reversal as in a mirror, and despite the very real difficulty about the date, it is on balance the best interpretation of the inscription to suppose that the image is a self-portrait. The inscription is unlikely to refer to the artist, for the inscriptions in The Pocket Book seem to specify the artist only on those (Cat. Nos 88-90) which are by Cooper, while in the Rosse group, the inscriptions specify the sitter. This miniature and Cat. No. 141, which are inscribed Mrs Rosse, seem to agree in feature, and, as Reynolds pointed out, the differences could be attributable to the latter image being apparently a few years later on costume than the present miniature. \n\nDespite the apparent anomalies of costume, the date c.1680 seems right for this miniature, so the other Mrs Rosse, the artist's mother-in-law Elizabeth, born Nuttings or Nattings, would have been too old to be the sitter, either for this or for Cat. No. 141. She had married Christopher Rosse in St Margaret's, Westminster, on 19 April 1636. \n\n1 Minute in reply to a request from Reynolds for advice on the dating, for his 1975 publication on The Pocket Book; department files.\u201d \n",
