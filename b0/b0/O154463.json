The turned crease has been chamfered to make a dull cutting edge. The bottom surface of the blade is pierced with an off-centre hole, and the top with a peripheral key shape. The cutting edge is approximately 5 7/8 in. (15cm) long. The blade is polished on the exterior surfaces and the interior has a white pickle finish. The handle is a curved eighteen-gauge (1mm) tube that is attached off-centre to the rear of the bottom plate. It has a sand-blasted spiral along its length and terminates in a 6 5/8 in (17cm) diameter, eighteen-gauge circular-saw finial that has a whited finish and is part creased upwards out of the plane. A short bandsaw segment attaches at the finial and carries a small charm-a cast hand!",

This object is active, not passive. It is an instrument. It demands attention. The serrated wheel and blade give visual warnings to the inattentive.
