            "public_access_description": "This poster promotes the second congress of the Estonian Popular Front and displays the logo of the Popular Front. \n\nThe Estonian Popular Front was the largest mass movement during the period of reform, 1988-1991, which culminated in the Republic of Estonia regaining independence from Soviet rule. The idea of the Popular Front was announced by politician Edgar Savisaar live on Estonian Television during the 'Let's Think' programme on 13 April 1988.  It answered an urgent need to establish a legal opposition to the Communist Party and a democratic movement to support 'perestroika' reforms in Estonia. On the same night the founding committee of the Popular Front was formed and the movement's declaration was drafted. Heinz Valk, the designer of this poster, was present at these events, and has described the spirit of those around him: \"The feeling was odd, because by doing so [forming the Popular Front] we had entered the big boys' league. What we set as our aim - getting political power and opposing the Communist Party - was far from a joke in the early spring of 1988. It felt as if something uncontrollable was about to enter our lives. As though from that moment, we became chessmen of a greater power, fate. And where it would all take us, we could not predict.\"\n\nThe Popular Front became the main representative of the political centre in Estonia and, as such, was the leader of a number of mass events during Estonia's 'Singing Revolution'. The founding congress of the Popular Front took place on 1-2 October 1990 at the Tallinn City Hall concert/sports venue. The organisation terminated its activities in October 1993.",
