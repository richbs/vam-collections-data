She has a walking motion, as her legs move back and forward her head swings from side to side.  She has holes in her back that indicates a speaking box but this no longer works.  Her face has a light amount of blue eye shadow and bright red lips.  Her body shape is that of a teenage doll for the period with small breasts, but she still looks childlike.\n\nShe is dressed in bridal wear which includes, white socks, shoes, knickers, veil and hat.  Her dress is trimmed with lace and gold.  Her hair is blond and set in a tight style.  She has plastic snow drops on either side of her hair.  She also has a corsage on her right wrist, which consists of a pink flower and snow drops held in place with a ribbon.  She has a gold chain around her neck held together with a safety pin.  There is a thin hair net holding her hair in place and this was probably part of the original packaging.",
