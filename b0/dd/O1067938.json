The frame has a billet moulding between two channels and is hinged on one long side to attach two covers, which are fastened by lugs secured by a sprung-steel double hasp (one missing). Each cover is engraved and flat -chased with a symmetrical pattern of rectilinear strap and foliate scrolls, with a bird with outstretched wings in the centre, on a punched ground. In one side is an octagonal bevelled glass mirror, and in the other, secured by a slip-in cover-gilt and engraved with symmetrically repeated ornament of two foliate scrolls on a tooled ground, is the slightly convex glass.",
