A photographer, publisher, writer and gallery owner, he played a key role in the promotion and exploration of photography as an art form. He also helped introduce modern art to an American audience. In 1916 Stieglitz first saw the work of Georgia O'Keeffe (1887-1986) and was impressed by the expressive power of her large abstract drawings. The following year he hosted her first solo exhibition at his gallery '291' in New York. He also started to photograph O'Keeffe, posing her in front of her work and finding ways to fuse her body with the compositions. This was the start of an extraordinary collaboration that lasted over twenty years and resulted in over three hundred photographs. Stieglitz and O'Keeffe's artistic dialogue extended to a profound influence on each other's work. They became lovers and married in 1924. \nThe Georgia O'Keeffe Foundation has recently given the V&A a group of photographs by Stieglitz. The ten portraits of O'Keeffe shown here were taken between 1918 and 1937. The early, sensuous images were taken in the studio and printed on platinum and palladium paper, giving a fine tonal range. Later, there is a move away from symbolically charged images to an increasingly frank record of an individual. Influenced by O'Keeffe's paintings and by the work of Paul Strand (whose portrait of Stieglitz is on display next door), Stieglitz adopted an arguably more Modernist approach in the 1920s and 1930s. He started to make small gelatin-silver prints of exquisite precision and sharp tonal contrast and to explore the artistic and spiritual potential of his everyday surroundings. The latest photograph shown here, taken the year that Stieglitz gave up photography because of ill health, shows O'Keeffe wrapped in a blanket, like a Pueblo Indian - a reference perhaps to her fascination with New Mexico, where she moved after Stieglitz's death. \nStieglitz saw his photographs of O'Keeffe as a composite portrait. Seen together, they explore themes of multiplicity, fragmentation, time and change, as well as O'Keeffe's personality, beauty and creativity. We might also read the portraits as a record of Stieglitz and O'Keeffe's love affair and of their remarkable creative synergy."

He also helped introduce modern art to an American audience. \n\nStieglitz first saw the work of the painter Georgia O\u2019Keeffe (1887\u20131986) in 1916 and, impressed by its expressive power, he hosted her first solo exhibition at his gallery \u2018291\u2019 in New York. He also started to photograph O\u2019Keeffe, posing her in front of her work. This was the start of an extraordinary collaboration that lasted over 20 years and resulted in over 300 photographs. The two married in 1924. In the 1920s and 1930s, influenced by O\u2019Keeffe, Stieglitz started to make prints of exquisite precision and sharp tonal contrast and to explore the artistic and spiritual potential of his everyday surroundings. \n\nThe Georgia O\u2019Keeffe Foundation has given the V&A a group of photographs by Stieglitz, including ten portraits of O\u2019Keeffe taken between 1918 and 1937. The sequence charts an evolution from early, sensuous, symbolically charged images to an increasingly frank record of an individual. Stieglitz saw his photographs of O\u2019Keeffe as a composite portrait. Seen together, they explore themes of multiplicity, fragmentation, time and change, as well as O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s personality, beauty and creativity.",

She determined that a photograph  had to be mounted to be considered for the key set because she knew that for Stieglitz a photograph was not completed until it was mounted and that this was evidence that he was satisfied with the print. Duplicate mounted prints were than dispersed to 13 others museums.\nHowever, there were a number of photographs in Stieglitz\u2019s possession when he died that were not mounted. Some of these were very poor quality prints, and these have now been put into a study collection that will be given to the NGA. Others, however, were quality  good, often excellent prints that had not been spotted, and these are the works that the O\u2019Keeffe Foundation is now dispersing.\nBefore these photographs were sent to any institutions, the O\u2019Keeffe Foundation, wisely, decided that they should be conserved (this was pretty consolidation). And they determined that the photographs should be mounted on boards of similar colour and texture and identical size to the comparable prints in the key set.\nStieglitz was adamant about his mounting: the size, colour, texture, and placement of the photograph on the board were critical issues to him . To be true to the spirit of the gift, you should try, at all costs, to preserve the sizes of Stieglitz\u2019s mounts, even though you will end up with some odd-sized frames.\n(Correspondence Sarah Greenough with Mark Haworth-Booth, June 2003)",

            "historical_context_note": "After Stieglitz (1864-1946) was a pioneer of modern photography. A photographer, publisher, writer and gallery owner, he played a key role in the promotion and exploration of photography as an art form. He also helped introduce modern art to an American audience. In 1916 Stieglitz first saw the work of Georgia O'Keeffe (1887-1986) and was impressed by the expressive power of her large abstract drawings. The following year he hosted her first solo exhibition at his gallery '291' in New York. He also started to photograph O'Keeffe, posing her in front of her work and finding ways to fuse her body with the compositions. This was the start of an extraordinary collaboration that lasted over twenty years and resulted in over three hundred photographs. Stieglitz and O'Keeffe's artistic dialogue extended to a profound influence on each other's work. They became lovers and married in 1924. \nThe Georgia O'Keeffe Foundation has recently given the V&A a group of photographs by Stieglitz. The ten portraits of O'Keeffe shown here were taken between 1918 and 1937. The early, sensuous images were taken in the studio and printed on platinum and palladium paper, giving a fine tonal range. Later, there is a move away from symbolically charged images to an increasingly frank record of an individual. Influenced by O'Keeffe's paintings and by the work of Paul Strand (whose portrait of Stieglitz is on display next door), Stieglitz adopted an arguably more Modernist approach in the 1920s and 1930s. He started to make small gelatin-silver prints of exquisite precision and sharp tonal contrast and to explore the artistic and spiritual potential of his everyday surroundings. The latest photograph shown here, taken the year that Stieglitz gave up photography because of ill health, shows O'Keeffe wrapped in a blanket, like a Pueblo Indian - a reference perhaps to her fascination with New Mexico, where she moved after Stieglitz's death. \nStieglitz saw his photographs of O'Keeffe as a composite portrait. Seen together, they explore themes of multiplicity, fragmentation, time and change, as well as O'Keeffe's personality, beauty and creativity. We might also read the portraits as a record of Stieglitz and O'Keeffe's love affair and of their remarkable creative synergy.",
