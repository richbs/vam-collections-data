The H-Line was one of Dior\u2019s most controversial silhouettes, and the press debated whether it should stand for \u2018Heavenly\u2019 or \u2018Horrid\u2019.  \n\nThe design of the H-Line deliberately flattened the bosom to create a moulded, elongated shape that many found unfeminine.  Dior maintained that it was inspired by Tudor dress, this influence can be seen here in the rich geometric embroidery of this dress.\n\nThe dress was worn with a gold satin coat, originally designed with a dark fur lining.",
