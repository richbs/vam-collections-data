It came to the Museum together with no. 100 (1-3), which, from the inscriptions, clearly had a link with the French.  Godeheu, to whom the drawing is dedicated, was a member of Council at Chandanagar and was befriended by Dupleix while the latter was Intendant there in 1730-41.  Later, in 1754, Godeheu became Governor-General of the French Settlements. , succeeded Dupleix at Pondicherry and made peace with the British. He ruined Dupleix by rejecting his claims for reimbursement of sums which he had advanced from his own private fortunate.  He then negotiated with Saunders, the British Governor at Madras, giving up the various points at issue with the British, thus reducing the French position in South India.  Godeheu left for France in 1755.",
