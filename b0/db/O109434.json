The first cubes appeared on the shelves of Budapest toyshops in 1977. Ideal Toys signed a deal with Rubik to bring the toy to the West in 1979. It won prizes for outstanding inventions in Hungary and in 1981 it became an exhibit at the New York Museum of Modern Art. Everybody wanted the puzzle and it very quickly became a part of everyday life. By 1982 Rubik's Cube became part of the Oxford English Dictionary. However by 1983 saturation point had been reached and the market collapsed.  A new limited addition cube was released in 2004.",
