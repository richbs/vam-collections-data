            "public_access_description": "In the 18th century cut-paper images (usually blackened) were called 'shades'. If they were portraits, they were known as 'profiles'. The fashion for 'profiles' grew in the 1770s, when the archaeological discoveries of ancient Roman sites at Herculaneum and Pompeii encouraged a taste for Neo-classicism. The 'silhouette' was later named after a French minister who was notorious for wasting his time on this popular hobby. Commercially, it was very successful, because in its simplest form it was a cheap and quick method of portraiture. With mechanical aids, a sitting could be done in one minute. There was no need for further tedious sittings to make endless repeats of the portrait for family and friends.  Despite more sophisticated and expensive variations on the simple cut-paper silhouette, this continued as an affordable form of portraiture well into the 19th century.  \n\nThis cut-paper silhouette is one of three silhouettes which have descended from one family (E.176-178-1998).  The silhouettes were acquired with two darning samplers, worked by girls seemingly from the same Quaker family at Ackworth School in Yorkshire, a Quaker school founded in 1779; one by Eliza Broadhead in 1785 (T.731-1997) and one by Jean Miller in1801 (T.732-1997).   \n\nAccording to a handwritten label on the reverse of the frame, dating from the early 20th century, this silhouette is this silhouette is of William Miller, who was born in Edinburgh 28 May 1796, and died in Sheffield 29 Jan 1882.  His silhouette is framed together with a silhouette of his wife (E.176-1998), Jane Miller (born Woodhead).  Jane Woodhead was born in Foulsham, on 29 April 1818, and was married in Manchester 27 June 1844.  She died in Edinburgh 12 November 1908.  It is not clear what the relationship was between the sitter, William Miller, who was born in Edinburgh in 1796, and the girl who embroidered the sampler in Yorkshire in 1801, Jean Miller.  It seems however that, as the samplers and silhouettes have descended within one family, the Broadhead, Miller and Woodhead families were related.",
