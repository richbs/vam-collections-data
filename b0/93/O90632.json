Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hard-wearing. Above all, they had to have the means for attaching a cord. Netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated being the katabori (shape carving), a three-dimensional carving. This one is in the unlikely form of a tortoise tied to a decorative roof tile - undoubtedly an ingenious way to stop a pet tortoise from wandering off.\n\nThe most widely used materials for making netsuke were traditionally wood or ivory. Since trees grow abundantly throughout Japan, wood is readily available and many varieties are comparatively cheap. There is also a long tradition of expertise in woodcarving in Japan. The small size of netsuke often makes identification of the wood used impossible. This example, however, can be identified as boxwood. This wood is ideal for netsuke carving, as it has a fine, dense and even grain, while also being durable. It has a pale and creamy colour that acquires an attractive patina, or it can be polished to a high lustre.",
