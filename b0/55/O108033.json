An inscription on the central arch states that it was built in 1199 by Qutbuddin Aibak. \n\nIt was one of the first Islamic monuments to be built in India by Hindu craftsmen. They laid blocks of stone horizontally and rounded the sides of individual stones to create the curve. The screen was ornately decorated with carved calligraphy and repeating scroll-like designs. \n\nThe iron pillar on the right-hand side of the photograph carries a Sanskrit inscription. This records that it was erected by King Chandra, a devotee of the god Vishnu. The king has now been identified as Chandragupta II (AD 375-413) and the pillar is dated to the 4th century. \n\nThe English photographer Samuel Bourne took this photograph on his journey through India during the 1860s. In the published account of his journey, he describes his first encounter with Delhi on 25 June 1863. He wrote: \u2018Of course Delhi can\u2019t fail to be interesting to the photographer:\u2026noted places must be taken, while\u2026mosques and similar buildings will be photographed for their own merits.\u2019",
