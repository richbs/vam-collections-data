The following images are interpretations of dreams, recollections, fears, nightmares and day to day experiences that were recorded in a journal from 1979-1981\". from the introduction.\n\nThis small square book is bound in innocuous looking pink material, the only indication of the sinister content is a small cap-gun on the end of a ribbon for use as a book-mark.\n\nThe book contains miniature tableaux depicting phobias along with a text relating to the phobia. The depictions use a variety of disturbing materials, such as hair, pins and human teeth. The collaged illustrations have a photographic portrait element, lending them anatomical authority of a distinctly alarming nature. \n\nLibrary's copy is no. 11, signed by the artist.",
