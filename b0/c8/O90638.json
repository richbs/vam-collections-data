Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hard-wearing. Netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated being the katabori (shape carving), a three-dimensional object, such as this one in the form of a gourd.\n\nNetsuke were made from a large number of materials, most commonly wood or ivory. This example, however, is made from wood covered in lacquer. Lacquer is the sap from the tree Rhus verniciflua, which grows mainly in East Asia. The craft of lacquering is highly complex, time-consuming and expensive. This netsuke is decorated with carved lacquer, a technique more commonly associated with China. After applying many layers of lacquer to the base until the desired thickness was achieved, the maker carved the design into the lacquer with chisels, knives and gouges. Here the carving is on two levels, with takaramono (\u2018auspicious objects\u2019) on the upper level against a geometric ground. All netsuke had to have a means of attaching the cord. This is cleverly achieved here by cutting a hole in one of the takaramono and connecting this to a central hole on the bottom.",
