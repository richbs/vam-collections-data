The seat is upholstered in leather tufted with wool, which appears to be original. Leather was particularly favoured for dining rooms, as it was easy to clean and did not absorb food smells.\n \nThe ladderback chair was originally made in the country, typically for cottages and farmhouses. It was usually made of British woods such as beech and ash. This pattern with a 'wavy-line' ladderback is similar to examples made in Lancashire. The type was imitated, and refined, in London workshops, as in this example. The London origin of this particular chair is revealed by the use of mahogany, the fine detailing of the top corners and back feet, and the square- rather than round-section legs and stretchers.",
