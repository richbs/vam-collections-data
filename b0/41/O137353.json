Sk\u00e5ne province, in the extreme south of Sweden, has the richest tradition, and more jewellery was worn there than in any other district.   Almost all the Swedish traditional jewellery at the V&A comes from Sk\u00e5ne.  \n\nSwedish rings were usually made of thin sheet silver, often decorated with coloured glass or pendants.  They were often given at marriage, but were part of the dowry wealth, not true wedding rings.  The bride and groom did not exchange rings in Sweden until the late 19th century.  \n\nThis ring comes from Sk\u00e5ne.  It has the maker\u2019s mark AF.  Anders Reinhold Flinkenberg was a silversmith who specialised in traditional jewellery in Simrishamn from 1820 to 1866.  Swedish traditional jewellers made lavish use of coloured glass in the 19th century.  Red was the most popular colour, as everywhere in Europe.",
