They were worn in a scabbard at the left hip, often matched with a dagger on the right hip for fighting in close. Swords were not just weapons but important decorative elements in masculine  costume. They were symbols of honour and rank for their owners throughout  Europe. \n\nThe classic rapier of the period 1570-1630 had a 'swept' hilt like this one. This was made up of  interlinked bars and rings in front of and behind the guard sweeping in an elegant  curve from the rear of the hilt to the knuckle guard. \n\nSword blades were articles of international trade, made in a few important centres and shipped all over Europe where they were fitted with hilts in the local fashion.",

            "historical_context_note": "Swords were not just weapons but important decorative elements in masculine  costume. They were symbols of honour and rank for their owners throughout  Europe. They remained an indispensible feature of outdoor dress of any person  with pretensions to status until the late 18th century in Europe.\n\nThe most common sword worn by gentlemen with their civilian dress from the  middle of the 16th century onwards was the rapier. From 1560 it was applied  almost exclusively to a fencing sword for civilian use.  It was usual for rapiers to be  accompanied by matching daggers. The rapier was a thrusting and slashing  weapon with a slender light blade, while the dagger was more robust, used  primarily for parrying and for thrusting in close. Rapier scabbards were suspended  from a belt in a form of sling while the dagger was generally worn in a sheath on  the left hip.\n\nIn England rapiers were subject to sumptuary laws determining levels the of  ostentation in which one might dress according to status. John Stow (ca. 1525- 1605) wrote of 'grave citizens' positioned by Royal decree at the gates of London  who job it was 'to break the Rapier's poynts of all passengers that exceeded a  yeard in length of their Rapier.'\n\nThe classic rapier of the period 1570-1630 had a 'swept' hilt like this one. This was made up of  interlinked bars and rings in front of and behind the guard sweeping in an elegant  curve from the rear of the hilt to the knuckle guard. It afforded much more  protection for the hand than the older straight quillons but was still not immune  from the thrust of a thin rapier blade.\n\nSword hilts became more and more elaborate after the introduction of firearms. Prior to that swords were used against armour primarily as cutting and thrusting  weapons while the hand was protected by a gauntlet or by mail. Improvements to firearms made much armour redundant and so freedom of  movement became more of a priority particularly as swords became more part of  civilian dress. Civilians were unlikely to wear hand protection in the way a soldier would and a forward thrust would expose the hand to danger. Hilts became more  elaborate as a result. Fencing as a training activity became increasingly codified and a standard part of male education. The most expensive hilts received the richest ornament that could be applied without impairing the sword's function.\n\nSword blades were articles of international trade, made in a few important centres and shipped all over Europe where they were fitted with hilts in the local fashion. During the 16th and 17th centuries the sword blades of Toledo (such as on this example), Valencia and  Milan were the most sought after but the largest centre of production was the German town of Solingen. The finest hilts were usually equipped with a Spanish blade but if not available a German blade (sometimes with a spurious Spanish inscription) was fitted instead.\n\nThe most prosperous swordmakers in Toledo were concentrated in an area bordered by a road called Calle de Armas (Weapon Street) where there were also ironsmiths, crossbow makers, knife and axe makers. Guild regulations in Toledo were strict. Those seeking to practise as swordmakers had to pass strict tests of quality stipulated by the King. The King also protected the Spanish trade by issuing a decree in 1567: \"... do not allow or permit to import any kind of sword in our kingdom from the exterior, and the ones made in Toledo wear the mark and signal of the master who made it and manufactured it, and the place where they are made, and whoever violates this they will be condemned as false.\"\n\nThe maker of this blade, Francisco Ruiz, was from a family that for several generations produced high quality blades that were traded around Europe.",
