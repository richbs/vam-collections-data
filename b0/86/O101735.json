This production by Nigel Playfair opened at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith on 23 November 1924 and was widely praised for its costume and set designs by George Sheringham representing 18th century Spanish dresses and scenery. \n\nNigel Playfair's 1920 production of  John Gay'sThe Beggar's Opera at the Lyric Theatre had set new standards in the fresh production of 18th century work, and The Duenna was considered a worthy successor.  George Sheringham inscribed this painting especially for Nigel Playfair so it may be a painting of him in the role rather than Sheringham's initial costume design.  It depicts Don Jerome at the comic moment in the opera when he brings his blunderbsss downstairs at night to shoot the gentleman serenading his daughter Donna Louisa outside their house.",

Nigel Playfair, who played Don Jerome, directed the production which was designed by George Sheringham.  It seems likely from the inscription that Sheringham painted this epecially for Nigel Playfair rather than it being his initial costume design.  It shows him in the scene where he brings his blunderbuss downstairs at night to shoot the gentleman who is serenading his daughter Donna Louisa, played by Elsa Macfarlane.",
