His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nHouse of Flowers, a musical presented on Broadway, New York, in 1954, is based on a short story by Truman Capote (1924-1984).  Set on a Caribbean island, rival madams of two bordellos compete for business, while a young, innocent girl experiences first love.   Messel won an Antoinette Perry 'Tony' Award for his set designs in 1956.   Despite all the ingredients for success, the musical failed to ignite the critics and public, and lasted only 165 performances.\n\nThe carnival scene provided Messel with an excuse to produce exuberant and colourful costume.  He accessorizes Gladiola's carnival costume with a bright pink and yellow headdress and trimming.   According to Messel's notes, the bright colours are intended  to evoke a tropical bird's colourful plumage.",
