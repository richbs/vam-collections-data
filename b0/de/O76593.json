The zigzags are decorated with a central stem bearing buds and with swollen yellow and dark blue S-motifs and with paired stylized cloud bands (in two colours). The lattice forms 3 and 2 half rows of diamonds and large'waisted; diamond.  The diamonds contain large jagged yellow diamonds, each with a central hexagon enclosing a blossom.  a large palmette, more omplex in design, links the zigzags.  In the 4 larger spaces there are pairs of floral animals in combat (or could it be one animal, not in combat?). The animals are not a mirror image (everything else appears to be).
