Street Party, Saxonwold makes comment on the effects of fear and crime in contemporary Johannesburg.  It is not the culture of criminals, but the anxiety they produce that Subotzky's recent works seek to unveil.  He looks on from a distance at the structures and rituals of surveillance that social division has produced.  Saxonwold is one of the oldest-parts of Johannesburg and is considered a wealthy suburb.  Subotzky captures a group of white adults and children socialising at a barbecue in the street, while a black security guard sits close-by.  He slumps in his chair, gazing into the distance, and seems invisible to the eyes of the white figures.",
