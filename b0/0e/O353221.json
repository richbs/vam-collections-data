The cap is stained and with holes.\n\nThe cap is constructed from a skull cap and a head band. The skull cap appears to have been padded with a layer of linen fibres. The layers have been quilted together and have rows of stitching, across the cap, approx. 15mm apart. The stitching is made with blue (poorly dyed) linen thread; s-spun, running stitch. The skull cap is made of two halves sewn at the centre with a whip stitch. A single line of thread is sewn on either side of the centre, which ends before the edge of the skull cap. Repairs have been made to the central stitch line across the crown. The repairs are in whip stitch and a light blue, linen thread (poorly dyed). The skull cap is then attached to a head band, approx. 45mm wide. This band does not appear to have extra padding. It is quilted in blue linen thread; running stitch; creating a guilloche pattern around the band.",
