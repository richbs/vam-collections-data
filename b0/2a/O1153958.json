It was designed by Jamie Reid (b.1947) and the fluorescent colours it was printed in and the title, taken from lyrics to their most famous song, were chosen in order to be noticed and to offend. The song that the title comes from, God Save the Queen, isn't featured on the track listing of this album proof, an illustration of the chaos that surrounded the making of this album, during the summer of 1977. The name would later be changed to Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's Sex Pistols shortly before the album was eventually released in October 1977.\n\nJamie Reid's cut-and-paste aesthetic grew from his interest in radical politics. His artistic style developed while at art college in Croydon, where he was influenced by the ideas of the avant-garde political group, the Situationist International. The political slant to his art was aroused by the May 1968 Paris student riots, which inspired fraternal protests organised by Reid at the Croydon College of Art. These were directed with fellow student Malcolm McLaren, later to become the manager of the Sex Pistols.",
