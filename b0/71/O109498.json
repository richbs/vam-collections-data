Most of these art works take the form of billboards or posters. It began with the redundant District Line platform at Gloucester Road station, which has hosted a series of billboards. Other Platform for Art projects in 2004 have included Mark Titchner, Muntean/Rosenblum and Emma Kay.\n\nMuntean/Rosenblum, both born in 1962, have collaborated since 1992. They live and work in London and Vienna. Their project It Is Never Facts That Tell was a  collaboration between Platform for Art and Tate Britain as part of the Tate's Art Now programme. The works are photographs of drawings which feature generic adolescent figures appropriated from lifestyle and fashion magazines, but then transformed and reconstructed, together with fragments of text from similar sources, which appear to be captions but have an ambiguous relationship to the images. The figures themselves are also ambiguous, suggesting pathos, spirituality, and ennui.\n\nThis is a circuit poster, used at locations across the tube network to advertise the Platform for Art projects to travellers.",
