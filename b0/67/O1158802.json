            "public_access_description": "This object is one of a collection given to the museum.  The collection is quite important as it belonged to Dennis Arkinstall.  Dennis worked in the toy industry for a company called Lines Brothers Ltd, they were mostly famous for their Tri-ang range of toys.  Dennis was a sculptor and worked in the research and development of new toys for the company in particular the dolls which were produced under the Pedigree trade name.  The catalogues highlight that their range of dolls are realistic and produced by a sculptor.  We do not know when Dennis started working at the factory but we know that he was an influential figure in the designing of their most popular doll Sindy, which was produced in 1963.  \n\nThis collected includes dolls from other manufactures as he would have collected them to inspire new ideas.  They are often just heads, which was not uncommon as these were usually exported in large numbers and the bodies made at their destination as it was a cheap way to manufacture.  The collection also includes moulds and experimental pieces from the factory as well as complete ones in their presentation boxes. \n\nThis plaster moulded baby doll is a prototype design for the 8 inch Delite baby doll, catalogue reference number 6S/O. It is also similar in some aspects to the 8S/O, as it has straighter arms, although the hairstyle is wrong for this model. These models can be found in the Pedigree Catalogue no.70 dating to 1954/55.",
