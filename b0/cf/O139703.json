Like the earlier trend for fans parasols displayed an individual's style and could be used in a coquettish ritual to hide the modest bearer from unwanted glances.\n\nThis blue silk parasol from the 1860s has supportive ribs of whalebone, a lightweight alternative before the use of steel became universal. The 'L' shaped ivory handle is plain, not carved, a trend that reflects the decline of the quality of Chinese carving in the wake of the Opium wars. The handle is inscribed with the owner's name 'Mrs Musgrave' and is topped with a gold ring. The cover is held shut when not in use, by a band with a ring and mother-of-pearl button, this is positioned roughly a third of the way up the cover enabling it to be tightly wrapped.",
