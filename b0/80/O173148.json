She is the patron saint of artillerymen, military engineers and miners and all professions working with explosives. \n\nHer legend seems not to have any historical foundation behind it. It tells that her father built a tower with two windows where he shut his daughter in to keep her away from her suitors. Later he even killed her. Barbara persuaded the workmen to add a third window to the tower, which symbolises the Trinity.\n\nThe father himself was then killed by a lightning and that is why Saint Barbara became the patroness of all professions related to gunfire and firearms.\n\nThe statuette is made of pipeclay, which is a fine white clay used to make tobacco pipes and pottery. Conveniently situated on a major trading route, Siegburg was a centre of ceramic production with well-organised workshops and kilns in which also  pipe-clay figures were fired.",
