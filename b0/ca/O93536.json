            "public_access_description": "Gold and silver were not as highly coveted in China as in other ancient civilisations such as the Roman or the Parthian, but they came to play a more central role in Chinese society by the beginning of the Tang dynasty (AD 618-907) when frequent trade contacts between China and its western neighbours developed along the Silk Road. Chinese goldsmiths often imitated the foreign shapes and styles of the imported goods and developed new techniques under the influence of Central Asian craftsmen who had settled in Chinese urban centers beginning in the mid 7th century. \n\nThis cup was probably used to drink alcohol and clearly shows how foreign shapes were  imitated during the Tang dynasty.",
