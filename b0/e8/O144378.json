The work is also named at the end as the Trailokya dipi, which is more usually applied to the Sangrahani Sutra of Jinabhadragani Kshamashramana, the earliest work of this class. The work is accompanied by an interlinear text in smaller devanagari script, which is possibly the commentary of Devabhadra. This manuscript is written on 56 oblong folios of paper of which two folios (10a and 12a) are not numbered, the last numbered folio being 54. The outer folios are of double thickness and decorated with a central ogee medallion and floral motifs on their outer faces. The copy is undated but appears to have been written and illustrated in Western India during the 18th century.\nThis folio (1) recto is a chitraprshthika painting (a cover design).\nFolio 1 verso (numbered 1) is text.",

The manuscript, made in the eighteenth century, includes illustrations and cosmic diagrams.\nThe recto of this folio shows  8 of the 14 jewels of  a Chakravartin or universal sovereign: discus, umbrella, staff, throne, sword, cowrie shell (money), jewel, and family priest. The verso (numbered 42 in Devanagari script) shows the remaining 6 jewels of the Chakravartin: elephant, horse, commander-in-chief, householder, carpenter and queen; and two of the seven jewels of  a Vasudeva: discus and bow and arrow. The remaining five jewels of Vasudeva are shown on the next folio of the manuscript. In Jain belief the Chakravartin is destined to become a Tirthankara, one of the 24 venerated Jain spiritual preceptors. Vasudeva is in Hinduism an epithet of the god Krishna, but in the Jain tradition the Vasudevas are nine minor deities whose attributes relate to those of Krishna. Vasudeva is described in Jain texts as dark skinned and dressed in yellow garments.",
