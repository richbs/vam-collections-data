Full Citation:  \n\n\"<b>68 Unknown Woman, formerly called Princess Elizabeth</b> \n(b.1635 d.1650) \n<b>c.1648</b>   \nEvans 11   \n \n<b>Oval 42 x 35 mm</b> \n\nFeatures in sharp, wiry hatches of brown, with some sanguine and blue-grey shadow and white heightening in the eyes, over a pale carnation ground; hair in brown washes, lined in darker colour with some gouache heightening; dress in blue washes, modelled with darker colour and the lights in white; the red robe in very transparent gummy red; background in thick brown washes; on vellum put down on a leaf from a table-book. \n\n<b>Condition:</b> Faded; loss of sanguine in the face presumably parallel to the evident fading in the red robe; flaking overall.  \n \n<b>Signed:</b> Not signed. Inscribed on a laid-paper packing in the case, in ink, in an eighteenth century hand: <i>Skippa</i>[...] and other illegible and truncated marks.  \n \n<b>Frame:</b> A made-up oval gold locket, the convex back of copper enamelled in colour with paeonies, tulips, carnations, lilies, etc., with leaves, on a black ground; the enamelling datable to c.1645 according to John Cooper, (1) but current on enamelled watch cases and in French ornament generally through the 1650s, 1660s and even later, according to Michael Snodin.(2) the sides are an added ring of plain rounded form, turning into bezels at the back and the front, and holding a facetted bevelled glass, which is possibly eighteenth-century; the hanger is a loop of inverted D-section (the flat side outward), soldered transversely to the top; inscribed on the back in ink 1787, corrected from 1777.  \n \n<b>Provenance:</b> Acquired by the Hon. F H A Wallop before 1927; lent to the V&A until 1949; given to Alan Evans, by whom bequeathed to the National Gallery, 1974; placed on indeterminate loan at the V&A. (See Appendix 3.)  \n \n<b>Exhibited:</b> V&A, Treasures of the Print Room: Recent Acquisitions 1976-77 (unnumbered) .  \n \n<b>Literature:</b> Summary Catalogue, 1981 p. 10; Murdoch 1981, pl. 22B. \n \nFormerly identified as Princess Elizabeth, daughter of Charles 1. Wallop may not have believed this, however, since he dated the miniature to 1651, the year after her death. For Elizabeth, the crucial likenesses are by Van Dyck (as a child) and by Lely (aged 12).(3) Although the miniature belongs in Cooper's oeuvrec.1648 and, although there is some resemblance between the sitter and the Princess as painted by Lely in 1647, the identification cannot be sustained. The sitter is clearly a more mature woman than Elizabeth at this time, and it would not be difficult to find resemblances at least as plausible among other Court beauties. The pose is a simplification of a type popularised by Van Dyck,(4) and taken up by Lely in the mid-1640s. In Cooper's work it appears most notably in the Unknown Lady of 1646 in the Lugt Collection.(5) and in the so-called Lady Margaret Ley of 1648 in the Fitzwilliam Museum.
