They were used for growing spring bulbs indoors, the detatchable collared cups being for hyacinths. In November 1767 Josiah Wedgwood sent his partner Thomas Bentley several  'Root Flower Pots'. Bentley was uncertain about their use, evidently confusing some with punchbowls. This prompted Wedgwood to write: 'Your Punch bowl is a Winter Flowerpot, not to be fill'd with water & branches of flowers, but with sand, & bulbous roots.' \n\nMaterials & Making\nThe bulb pot is made of Black Basalt, one of several types of pottery Wedgwood developed or perfected in order to respond to  changes in taste. Wedgwood called the type of painting on this piece 'encaustic'. This term was originally used for an ancient Greek and Roman technique of painting in which pigments are combined with hot wax. Wedgwood's encaustic decoration was painted in a mixture of enamel pigments and slip (a mixture of clay and water), and then fired onto the surface. Unlike Jasper (his greatest invention), Wedgwood patented his encaustic painting technique. However, the patent gave him little protection and the technique was immediately taken up by other potters.",
