            "public_access_description": "This elephant would probably have been made to carry a figure of the Hindu god Aiyanar or Ayannar such as the V&A example number IM.15-1939. Aiyanar is one of the most popular folk-deities of rural south India where he serves as the principal protective deity of village communities, especially from the malevolent forces that abound at night. His shrines are readily identified in the countryside, where painted terracotta horses are dedicated to him; these are usually located outside the village or town boundaries.\n\nAiyanar is generally worshipped as the son of Siva, though his origins are undoubtedly in a local hero (vira) cult deity. Legend attributes his birth to a sexual union between Siva and Visnu who appeared to Siva in a female form as Mohini. Due to his parentage, he is revered by both followers of Siva and Visnu. He is also referred to by some devotees as Harahariputa, that is, the son of Hara (Siva) and Hari (Vishnu), underscoring the manner in which he bridges the two principle sects of Hinduism.\n\nAiyanar is exceptional in that he is a village guardian deity elevated into the pantheon of temple Hinduism, where processional bronze images were commissioned. He is here represented seated in a relaxed posture (sukhasana) and holding an elephant goad (ankusa). His radiating hair, mimicking that worn by Siva in his ascetic\u2013yogic forms, is decorated with a cobra and crescent moon, thus identifying himself closely with Siva. The elephant on which he rides wears bell-garlands and a small \u2018howdah\u2019-pedestal on which Aiyanar sits. Behind Aiyanar, holding on precariously, is a smaller figure, presumably the elephant-keeper (mahout). A similar ensemble is preserved in the Government Museum, Chennai.",
