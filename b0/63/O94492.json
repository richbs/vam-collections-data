Around 1760, however, the shape of the tea caddy changed, becoming flatter and more box-like, and a separate implement for measuring the tea was needed. The form of a shell was popular from the start, perhaps because sea shells were packed with the tea for sampling by merchants. A fluted design also helped to strengthen the thin silver that was most often used. Some caddy spoons were modelled after cutlery patterns and serving ladles. Pierced caddy spoons replaced the \u2018mote spoon\u2019 for removing floating tea leaves.",
