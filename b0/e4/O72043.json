A torturer (right) holds the rope in his left hand and places his right on Christ's arm. Another torturer (left) holds his scourge head downwards. Two other torturers (top left and right) raise their scourges.\n[Panel] Christ, with a forked beard and naked but for a loincloth, stands in the centre of the panel behind a column, looking back to his right. The column, which is set in a depression in the ground, has 'IHS' carved on the base. His arms encircle the column and are bound at the wrists with a rope, held by a torturer on the right of the panel, who is wearing a rolled brim hat, short tunic with wide sleeves over a long-sleeved undergarment, with a low belt with a purse hanging from it and pointed shoes. He braces his right hand against Christ's left elbow, his left leg is bent at the knee and he rests his foot on a ledge on the ground. Three other simlar figures holding scourges are represented on the panel, one on Christ's left and two at the top holding scourges above their heads.\n\nThe top left corner has been broken off and the hands and the scourge of the torturer in this corner are missing. The corner has been repaired with alabaster. Little colour remains on the panel. The gilding on the borders of the garments and elsewhere is modern. The back of the panel bears four horizontal marks. There are five holes, three of which hold thick latten wires.",

However the IHS inscription at the base of the column in unusual. \n\nThere are two sorts of alabaster. Calcite alabaster is very hard and was used in ancient times. This object is made of gypsum alabaster which is a fine-grained, soft and smooth stone. Although at first glance it looks a little like marble, which it was intended to imitate, it was much easier to carve due to its softness, and alabaster objects were therefore significantly cheaper to produce. Marble does not originate in England, so it was imported if needed, whereas in the 15th century there were important alabaster quarries in Nottingham, York, Burton-on-Trent and London. England was a major centre for the production of objects such as this one. During period, they were exported in very large numbers to Europe where they survive, unlike many examples which remained in England and were destroyed or greatly damaged during the Reformation.",
