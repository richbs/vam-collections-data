The skull cap is made of six triangles of fabric sewn together. Where the points join a bead of a dark blue stone is sewn with red silk thread. The head band (650mm in width) is formed of the same fabric. The cap is quilted all over with a red, silk thread, forming geometric patterns. The fabric has a band of stripes (light blue, dark blue, buff; different widths) alternating with a band of blue and white (either floral like shapes, script or animals- cat/gazelle). Around the headband is an inscription in Arabic. Other lettering forms part of one of the triangles of the skull cap. The padding is of undyed wool? (possible linen fibres)  with a lining of plain woven, undyed linen. At the very centre of the inside of the skull cap a long (110mm), thick thread of red silk remains attached. It is entwined with piece of fabric and small wool/fibre clumps. A few small pieces of blue and buff checked silk are stuck to the outside of the cap. The cap has a hole on one side of the headband and the lining on the other side is missing.",

            "public_access_description": "A head cap of woven silk with padding of wool? and a lining of woven linen. Egytpian, ca. AD1250-1500. From a tomb. The cap comprises of a skull cap and an attached head band. The skull cap is made of six triangles of fabric sewn together. Where the points join a bead of a dark blue stone is sewn with red silk thread. The head band (650mm in width) is formed of the same fabric. The cap is quilted all over with a red, silk thread, forming geometric patterns. The fabric has a band of stripes (light blue, dark blue, buff; different widths) alternating with a band of blue and white (either floral like shapes, script or animals- cat/gazelle). Around the headband is an inscription in Arabic. Other lettering forms part of one of the triangles of the skull cap. The padding is of undyed wool? (possible linen fibres)  with a lining of plain woven, undyed linen. At the very centre of the inside of the skull cap a long (110mm), thick thread of red silk remains attached. It is entwined with piece of fabric and small wool/fibre clumps. A few small pieces of blue and buff checked silk are stuck to the outside of the cap. The cap has a hole on one side of the headband and the lining on the other side is missing.",
