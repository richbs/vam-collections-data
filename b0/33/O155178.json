He was born in Liverpool and trained at Central School of Art and Design, graduating in 1984. He worked extensively for Christopher Gable at Northern Ballet Theatre, where he designed such works as Carmen, The Brontes and A Christmas Carol, and has designed stage shows for French and Saunders and Victoria Wood. Lez is especially linked with Matthew Bourne's dance company New Adventures (formerly Adventures in Motion Pictures) for which he designed Highland Fling, Swan Lake, Edward Scissorhands, The Car Man and Cinderella. Lez's costume designs for The Little Foxes display his characteristic figures; often looking to the left, they strike a strong and distinct pose. \n\nThe Donmar Warehouse production of The Little Foxes was directed by Marianne Elliot and starred Penelope Wilton as Regina Giddens, the main protagonist of the money-grasping Hubbard family. Lillian Hellman's play attempts to dissect the evils of capitalism and the play premiered in New York in 1939 starring Tallulah Bankhead and was subsequently filmed in 1941 starring Bette Davis.",
