Volume II. 17th-18th century</u>, London, 1979, p. 101 The following is the full text of the entry: Design for the back of a coach Pen and ink and wash 7 7/8 x 7 5/8 (199 x 193) 116 PROVENANCE J. Talman (as shown by traces of gold borders and the mark inscribed on the back: cf. Lugt &lt;i&gt;Supplement&lt;/i&gt; 2926a, and 2926b); it is not recorded how the Museum, in its early days, acquired the sheet One of a series of three designs for the same coach (see nos. 862 and 863). The arms of Boncompagni are on the right, those of . Borghese on the left. A winged dragon, an &lt;i&gt;impresa&lt;/i&gt; of the Boncompagni, occurs on the other two drawings. It follows that the designs were made in 1658 on the occasion of the marriage between Giambattista Borghese, afterwards Prince of Sulmona (1639-1717) and Eleonora Boncompagni (1642-95), daughter of Ugo Boncompagni, Duke of Sora. The drawings are rather different in handling from those familiar designs, at Windsor and Diisseldorf, for example, which are usually attributed to artists like Ciro Ferri and Giovanni Paolo Schorr, the pen work being rougher and more broken: but they seem to have a Roman character. Nos. 862 and 863 are evidently alternative designs for the front of the coach, showing the shafts, while no. 861 is for the back.",
