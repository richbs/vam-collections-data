The complete outfit consisted of a bronze and turquoise wool Tonik suit (1960s); a Ben Sherman cotton shirt; cotton towelling sports socks; these Dr Marten leather loathers and a Hardy Amies wool blue beat hat. \n\nThe roots of Two Tone lay in Jamaican Rude Boy culture which had its origins in the ghettos of Kingston. Young, urban and frequently unemployed, Rude Boys drew inspiration for their cool and smart style \u2013 sharp suits, thin ties and pork-pie or Trilby hats \u2013 from American gangster movies. In the 1960s, increased emigration brought Rude Boy style and music, ska and rocksteady, to the UK, where it particularly influenced Skinhead culture. In the late 1970s the style was revived through the music and fans of the Two Tone ska revival. The sharp tailoring remained and was emphasised through a predominantly black and white palette.\n\nJerry Dammers was one of the chief agents in the promotion of the Two Tone look. As founder of The Specials, the 2 Tone record label, and as a graphic artist, he was mainly responsible for the distinctive black and white Two Tone image. He discovered a 1960s single-breasted Mod suit in a second hand shop which promptly led to the look being picked up by subsequent Two Tone bands and their fans.",
