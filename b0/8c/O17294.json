The President of the Royal Academy considered that its 'perfection of execution' made Rubens seem 'gross and vulgar'. Constable, however, saw it as proof that a 'production made upon a picture' is inferior to one 'founded on original observation'.",

DONATT'S CASTLE, \nGLAMORGAN \nOil on panel, 132 X 228 cm\n220-1871\n\nIn 1803 Sir George Beaumont, patron, artist and collector, and virtually the founder of the National Gallery, was given by his wife Sir Peter Paul Rubens's landscape <i>The Chateau de Steen, Autumn,</i>now in the National Gallery. It was taken to the studio of the President of the Royal Academy, Benjamin West, who invited, among others, James Ward, the animal painter, to see it. Ward determined to produce a painting which would rival Rubens, and used a panel of almost exactly the same size to paint <i>Bulls Fighting</i>. When it was completed some critics, amongst them West and Beaumont, admired it, others, notably John Constable, dismissed it as being a mere imitation of an old master. \n\nIn reality Ward's painting is far from being a mere imitation of Rubens, for the bulls are inspired by a work by George Stubbs. It is interesting to see how Ward has changed the classical, static calm of Stubbs' composition into the fulcrum for a romantic synthesis of moods - a struggle which mirrors the threat of coming storm, and the high winds which have uprooted the massive tree, the central element of the design. All these factors give the picture, not the tranquil enjoyment of Rubens' landscape, with its Shakespearean feeling for the ordered cycle of the seasons, but an emotive Wordsworthian identification with the wilder aspects of nature. Like Rubens' own copies after Titian, Ward's painting can be enjoyed both as an expression of its own time, and as a vivid lesson in art historical appreciation. \n\nLionel Lambourne\"\nGrundy, C.
