At the time of its acquisition, Richard Slee made the following observations about the bowl:\nThis is one of a short series, probably 4 pieces, using the rim of the bowl as a 'containment', The others I remember used Trees, a garden wall, and one with Doors in the way that building sites were fenced off in those days. I think that picket fence piece was the most successful of the series. The materials, clay, glaze were those at hand in Dan's Studio, so now look strange as compared to later work They [the series of bowls] owe more to Pop Art than Studio Pottery, at that time I doubt I would have known or understood the term Postmodernism.\n(Email from Richard Slee, 1 Feb 2011; V&A Registered File 2010/931).",
