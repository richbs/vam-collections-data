In 1735 the Comtesse had commissioned Lemoyne to execute a monument to her father, which should include his bust by Girardon and a statue of herself mourning his death. Completed in 1744 it was placed in the church of the Jacobins, Rue St Honor\u00e9. At the Revolution it was dismembered and partly destroyed, but the Girardon bust was set up later on a bracket in the church of St Roch and much later the bust of the Comtesse was set up alongside the bust of her father.\n\nIt has been suggested (R\u00e9au, Les Lemoyne, 1927) that this V&A bust was the preparatory sketch for the bust exhibited at the Salon, presumably because of its sketchy appearance, but it might perhaps be the 1738 Salon bust itself. Lemoyne excelled in portrait busts in marble and terracotta and this is a particularly lively example of his work.",

            "history_note": "In 1738 Lemoyne exhibited at the Salon a terracotta bust of Comtesse de Feuqui\u00e8res, daughter of Pierre Mignard. In 1735 she had commissioned Lemoyne to execute a monument to her father, to include his bust by Girardon and a statue of herself mourning his death. Completed in 1744 it was placed in the church of the Jacobins, Rue St Honor\u00e9. At the Revolution it was dismembered and partly destroyed, but the Girardon bust was set up later on a bracket in the church of St Roch and much later the bust of the Comtesse was set up alongside the bust of her father. It has been suggested (R\u00e9au, Les Lemoyne, 1927) that this V&A bust was the preparatory sketch for the bust exhibited at the Salon, presumably because of its sketchy appearance, but it might perhaps be the 1738 Salon bust itself.\n\nPreviously in the collection of David Weill (where it was known as Mlle. Clairon). Bought at Sotheby's on July 3rd, 1959, lot 63 (Property of a Gentleman).\n\nLemoyne excelled in portrait busts in marble and terracotta and this is a particularly lively example of his work.",
