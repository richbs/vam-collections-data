T-shirt of white cotton jersey, with a round neck, short sleeves and a machine-stitched hem.\n2. shorts of white cotton, with elasticated waist and machine-hemmed\n legs.  \nBoth garments are printed with the same design (across the chest of the T-shirt and around the sides of the shorts): Donatello is shown emerging from the sewer with his staff, while Michelangelo, Raphael and Leonardo stand around him brandishing their weapons.  The word \"TURTLES\" is printed in green above them.  \"Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles\" is the British name (thought to project a less violent image than the original) for \"Teenage Hero Ninja Turtles\", comic book characters created in the USA in the early 1980s by Peter Laird and Kevin Eastman, and marketed on a wide variety of goods for children by Mark Freedman's Surge Licensing Company.  Like \"The Simpsons\", their appeal to children is supposed to lie in adult disapproval (in this case, of the violence), and in the eccentric use of certain words and phrases based on California surfing slang and supposedly unintelligible to adults. (This design is probably a pirated one, as it  shows no copyright or licensing acknowledgements, Donatello is shown as brown rather than green, and the generic name of the characters is reduced).",
