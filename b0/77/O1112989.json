            "public_access_description": "Lez Brotherston (born 1961) trained at the Central School of Art and Design, graduating in 1984. He is an influential and innovative designer of film, theatre and opera, and is especially known for his work for dance, particularly for Matthew Bourne's companies, Adventures in Motion Pictures and New Adventures. He has designed Bourne's productions of Highland Fling, an up-dating of Les Sylphides set in a Glasgow council flat, Cinderella, which took place during the London Blitz, The Car Man, based on Bizet's opera Carmen, Edward Scissorhands, and, famously, Swan Lake with male swans, for which he won three awards.\n\nLes Liaisons dangereuseswas first published in 1782 and is composed entirely of letters between the main protagonists. There have been a variety of film, stage and radio adaptations of the novel. Adam Cooper starred, directed and choreographed this ballet version and this production bible is a unique record of the design process.\n\nA designer will create a 'bible' to contain the information required by costumiers and set builders. This example gives an insight into Brotherston's working methods. The costume designs are colour copies of his original drawings, with reproductions of 1780s fashion plates and fabric swatches as an aid to the makers. Brotherston always focuses on the costumes not the wearers, using a few standard poses for his figures, drawing the faces in profile and giving them all similar features. \n\nThe design bible also includes photographs of the set model. Brotherston does not produce set designs on paper as he prefers to create models and develop the set in three dimensions.  At the front of the bible are a series of photographs of the finished model which shows how one basic setting can be adapted to suggest different locations. The design bible also contains photographs of the cast, a scene breakdown and images which have been used for design ideas.",
