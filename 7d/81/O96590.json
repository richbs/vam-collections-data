This is the typical outfit a fashionable woman would have worn in the 1920s for riding.\n\nThe construction of riding habits was a highly specialised branch of the tailor's trade. The making of the apron skirts demanded particular skill. These were still worn over breeches for riding side-saddle, although breeches were becoming acceptable on their own for astride riding. The breeches are part-lined with denim, which is an interesting use of this hard-wearing fabric for sporting activities.",
