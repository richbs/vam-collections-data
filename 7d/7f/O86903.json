It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years. Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nThe musical farce On The Air was written by Bromley Challenor and May Elliott, and starred Bromley Challenor and Hayden Coffin. It was set in Lord Lorrimer's house and in Jimmy Lorrimer's palace in Persia and featured musical numbers including 'If Ophelia had Married Hamlet' and 'You're the Girl of my Heart'.  The actor-manager Bromley Challenor made his first appearance on the stage in Scotland in 1906 at the Theatre Royal Coatbridge and in 1915 bought the rights of the play When Knights Were Bold in which he toured as Sir Guy de Vere. It was produced at London's Kingsway Theatre in 1917.  Challoner played various parts in the West End and toured in several productions including The Punch Bowl, 1928, and Gentlemen Prefer Cooks, 1932.",
