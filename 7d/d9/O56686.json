The colours of 18th and 19th century embroideries were originally very bright but many have faded to pleasing pastel shades; often great quantities of metal thread were used. Napkins were mainly used to clean fingers during meals, but were also used as decoration and as covers and their designs were consistently inventive. Sashes were worn around the waist and were tied so that the decorative ends hung at knee level.",
