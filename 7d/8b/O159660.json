She offers affluence in exchange for justice, and, half unconsciously, the villagers consent, revealing the horrific universality of human weakness and greed.  \n\nAs Clara, Kathryn Hunter was part ageing diva, part poisonous toad.  Crippled in body, mind and soul, she jerked through the play on diamond-encrusted crutches, like some malevolent creature. \n  \nThis cream suit overlaid with a patchwork of laces, braids and appliqu\u00e9s, was worn for Clara's marriage to her seducer. It has an overload of accessories - a necklace made of chandelier drops, earrings, clips and hat decorations. The finishing touch was a nine metre train sewn with panties, bras and corsets - everything adding to a sense of gratuitous wealth. The visual, physical language, which lies at the heart of Complicite's performances, extends into the designs. Rae Smith's costumes for Clara underlined the moral of the play; not just costumes for a character, they were also a sign to the village people of the material gains possible to those who are seduced by Clara's demands.",
