            "public_access_description": "When this inlaid or intarsia panel was bought from a London dealer in 1878 nothing was known about the author or provenance of this work. In recent years it has been attributed to Fra Raffaele da Brescia (1479 - 1537), who executed intarsia panels for chapels of various monasteries, such as San Michele in Bosco, above Bologna. Fra Raffaele made arcaded panels with borders and lunettes virtually identical to this one, and trompe-l'oeil (literally, 'deceive the eye') images of every-day objects - in this case a clock typical of about 1500, with a twenty-four hour dial that rotated round a fixed pointer. During the upheavals in Italy that followed the Napoleonic invasions of the 1790s, these panels were dismantled and removed. Eighteen of them were salvaged in 1812 by Marchese Antonio Malvessi, who moved them to his family chapel, in S. Petronio, Bologna. This panel may have been 'one that got away'.",

            "history_note": "This object was purchased for \u00a330 from Messrs Stanard Warne & Son of 3 Bruton St., London in 1878. Its previous provenances remain unknown, but it almost certainly formed part of a series of intarsia panels made for the choir of the Olivetan monastery of San Michele in Bosco, outside Bologna, some time between 1513 and 1537, when their author, Fra Raffaele da Brescia (1479 - 1539), was a member of the order there. Following the French invasions of Italy in 1797, the panels were removed from this church and eighteen of them  were subsequently salvaged by Marchese Antonio Malvessi, who installed them in his family chapel in the Basilica San Petronio in Bologna, in 1812. This item was not included amongst Malvessi's panels.\n\nHistorical significance: This panel is significant for two reasons: the high standard of the still-lives and perspectives achieved by Northern Italian monks at the end of the 15th century and a very accurate and detailed representation of clocks of that period. By about 1450 perspective had become something of an obsession amongst artists, and wood of different colours was thought particularly suitable for creating this form of art, whether architectural fantasies or still-lives. This panel includes a particularly skillful representation of a chalice and cross, set at unorthodox angles. The representation of this twenty-four hour clock is one of the earliest examples of a timepiece, driven by clockwork mechanism.",

            "historical_context_note": "Between about 1430 and 1530, Italian woodworkers specialized in the art of making creating architectural fantasies and still-lives from different coloured woods, by inlaying them into panels of wood, mostly walnut. This art was first known as <i>tarsio</i> (and later as <i>intarsia</i>), and still-lives were referred to as <i>prospettive</i>. In Northern Italy, <i>intarsia</i> first flourished in Ferrara during the 1430s, and it there that Fra Giovanni da Verona  (1457 - 1525) first learnt his craft in the Benedictine monastery, which he entered in 1475.  Both the Benedictine order and its offshoot, the Olivetan order, to which  Fra Giovanni da Verona  and his pupil Fra Raffaele da Brescia (1479 - 1539) both belonged, laid stress on manual work as much as prayer, and fostered skills in this form of art, which was applied to flat surfaces, such as choir stalls, pulpits, and sacristy cupboards. Fra Raffaele lived and worked in the monastery of San Michele in Bosco between 1513 and 1537, where he produced a set of still-lives for the choir, of which the V & A's panel could well have formed a part.",
