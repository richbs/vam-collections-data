            "history_note": "According to the two inscriptions on the basin, the person who commissioned it was Sidi Muhammad,  son of Uzbak. The last title in the inscription is \"al-Maliki al-Ashrafi\", which refers to their allegiance to the Mamluk ruler Sultan Qa'itbay (r. 1468-86), whose regnal name was al-Malik al-Ashraf. The basin can therefore be dated before 1496. This accords with the death date of 1498 that Mayer records for the father, Uzbak, since Uzbak is referred to in terms that suggest he, too, was still alive when the basin was made.\n\nMayer gives the <i>terminus post quem</i> as 1482, as Sayyid Muhammad was elevated to the rank of Amir of Ten in that year and would presumably have started to use the type of titulature used on the basin at this time.",
