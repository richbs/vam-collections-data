'Pastel' is a coloured crayon made out of pigment mixed with a water-soluble binder such as gum.\n\nPastels can be blended on paper to achieve a soft, dusty finish.  Because this tonal technique is more like painting than drawing it is known as 'pastel painting'.\n\nTime\nThis portrait dates from around 1755-1764.  These dates are based partly on the fact that Cotes did not begin to produce works of this quality until 1755, and partly on costume style and hair style.\n\nMaterials and Making\nPastel offered a number of advantages over oil. It was a quick medium to work in since no drying time was necessary, so the sitter spent less time at the artist's studio.  Pastels were also cheaper than oils because they tended to be smaller in size, required fewer pigments and less time on the artist's part.  Unlike oils, pastels also had to be protected with glass, an expensive commodity at this date, which gave them added lustre and glamour.",
