            "public_access_description": "This casket was originally designed for security as much as elegance. However the silver mounts, which were probably added in the 19th century, have obscured this fact. The larger projecting ornaments or knops on the lid replaced the dials of a number-combination lock. The smaller knops replaced a pair of hinges at the back and the closing device at the front.\n\nThe casket is a good example of \tbrassware decorated with inlaid surface ornament. It was made in the heyday of the inlay technique. For larger motifs, metalworkers chiselled out small areas of brass and filled them with thin sheets of silver, gold and copper. They added details by chasing the surface of the softer metals. Contrast was created with a black filler.",
