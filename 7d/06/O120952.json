The pencil drawing is filled in with opaque blocks of bodycolour, creating an effect of finish which is emphasised by the fact that the design is signed with the name of the firm. A smaller pencil sketch shows the back of the suit, emphasising the silhouette and nipped-in waist, whilst the designer has made notes on the materials to be used and the knot motifs on the pockets. This design would have been used as a presentation drawing for clients to decide which model they wanted to have made. The pose struck by the woman is identical to that in E.477-2005 which is also a design for a black suit and the silhouettes of the two designs are extremely similar.",
