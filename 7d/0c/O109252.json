            "public_access_description": "Balenciaga was the most exclusive fashion house in Paris immediately after World War II. The Spanish-born couturier Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga (1895-1972), regarded by his peers as \u2018the Master\u2019, had moved to Paris from Spain in 1937. By 1952 he had 232 employees there and was producing 356 new designs per year. His clients, admitted to his salon only after a personal introduction, included many cosmopolitan women of different nationalities.  \n\nBalenciaga was a perfectionist in cutting, sewing and finishing garments, and was renowned for his exacting standards. The dress, shown here as it was displayed for the V&A\u2019s 2007 exhibition,  The Golden Age of Couture: Paris and London 1947-1957, reveals Balenciaga's preference for stiff, matte fabrics and his liking for the sombre black of the dress of the Spanish clergy - both contemporary and as depicted in the paintings of his fellow countryman, the artist Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n (1598\u20131664).",
