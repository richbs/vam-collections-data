He was a member of the group associated with the painter J.A.M. Whistler, who was a great influence on his work. \n\nRoussel made small editions of his prints; of this print, entitled Dawn, he made about four finished impressions. However he made about 60 trial proofs of this print, since the combination of printing techniques used was quite complex. As in this instance, Roussel also designed his own frames specifically for his prints; these frames are now highly prized collector\u2019s items. \n\nThe subject matter of \u2018dawn\u2019 is personified in the female figure floating in the air, symbolising the first light of the morning beaming through the clouds. In the area beneath, nymphs bathe in the lagoon. Roussel achieves an ethereal mood, with deep colours receiving emphasis from the moulded gilt frame (Museum no. E.503:2-2005).",
