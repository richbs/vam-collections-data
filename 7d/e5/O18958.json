            "public_access_description": "S. Birley in Derbyshire made this table for the International Exhibition of 1862, which was held in London. It won prizes in the furniture and the mining classes. Birley specialised in inlaid marble objects. These imitated the Italian mosaic inlaying technique known as pietra dura, or \u2018hardstone\u2019. This piece is one of the most elaborate pieces known. In this technique, thin polished slices of hard or semi-precious stone are used. They are cut to form images, for example of flowers or fruit. Often the colours of the stones are used to produce highly naturalistic detail.\n\nArtisans working for the powerful Medici family developed the art of Pietra dura in Florence in the 16th century. The technique is similar to marquetry on furniture. This achieves its decorative effect by arranging sections of differently coloured veneers in the manner of a jigsaw.",
