He started his career as a fashion photographer in New York in the 1980s and has since turned to fine art photography. Shafran's work has been exhibited worldwide and is held in a number of art collections including Nottingham Castle Art Gallery and Museum and the Arts Council Collection.\n\nShafran's work captures the intimacy and mundanity of everyday subjects by developing a narrative through the careful sequencing of images. His photographs are quietly attentive, seeking out the evocative spaces between the obvious and the conventionally illustrative.  He is attuned to the subtleties of light, and drawn to the details of the everyday: assemblages of objects seen as ready-made still life compositions, and tenderly observed moments of human interaction. Lawnmower Clippings was taken as part of a commission for an unpublished book project titled 'Rachel's Book.' The project was a collaboration between Rachel Whiteread, North design and Nigel Shafran.\n\nShafran has a close relationship with the V&A; he used the museum as the subject for a series of photographs taken in 1999. A selection of these photographs are held in the permanent collection along with images from Ruthbook, a sequence of chronological photographs taken between June 1992 and January 1995. Ruthbook reflects the nuances of a relationship over time and demonstrates Shafran's ability to capture the intrinsic value of everyday subjects.",
