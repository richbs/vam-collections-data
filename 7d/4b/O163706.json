            "physical_description": "<b>Description</b> \nThis piece consists of three fragments of the same object, which was originally the lid of a large bowl, probably a deep conical vessel of the kind widely known in Andalusi ceramics since the Almohad period. The lid is decorated on both sides, its pattern disposed in concentric circles. The inside of the lid has a complex geometric interlace pattern at the centre, bordered by a frieze of vegetal scrolls. This decoration is also seen on the bowl fragment 1186-1897 and suggests that bowls and lids may have been made in matching sets.\n\nThe exterior decoration of this lid is more complicated, which is appropriate for the part that would have been most visible. It has moulded rib ornaments which are commonly found on lids, even much smaller ones than this. Working from the inside out: at its centre there would have been a large knop to lift the lid and then support it when it was set upside down next to the dish. A band of solid lustre surrounds where the knop is now missing. The next concentric circle is filled with an inscription in a distinctive cursive hand, in the same style as the cursive inscriptions on the two Alhambra vases from Mazzara del Vallo in Sicily (see Comparative Study). The next concentric circle is narrow and consists of a braided motif. The next band contains the same floral scroll as seen on the interior of the vessel. The next surviving band seems to contain another inscription frieze. \n\n<b>Technical Description</b> \nThe original diameter can be extrapolated as around 45-50 cm. The so-called Malaga ship bowl, also in the V&amp;A (486-1864), also has a diameter of around 50 cm so may originally have had a lid of the same kind as this one.\n\nIt is very heavy, with a thick body. The clay body is surprisingly grey all the way through - the body colour may have changed as the result of the reduction conditions during the lustre firing. There seems to be a lot of quartz present in the clay. The body is also very finely levigated clay, which would seem to indicate high quality production.",

Hornblower, along with more than 1000 other pottery fragments. \n\nNotes from V&amp;A Archives: A selection of \u20181100 and more specimens\u2019, from Fostat and neighbourhood\u2019, including \u2018imported ware from Samarra\u2019. (Letter from Hornblower to Bernard Rackham, 4th January 1921). \n\nLetter from Hornblower 07/02/1921: Fragments to be packed and sent by Mr. E. Hatoun, Cairo. \u2018To prevent chipping or abrasion, the fragments will be packed in small palm-stick cages, which are exceedingly tough and elastic, and the cages then packed in wooden boxes. The case \u2018must first be presented at the Arabic Museum, Cairo, to be sealed\u2019. \u2018P.s. I propose \u00a3E200 as value for insurance\u2019. \nComparative Study The decoration of geometric interlace, floral scrolls and cursive inscriptions is very close in style to the decoration of the pair of vases found in the Church of Madonna del Paradiso di Mazzara del Vallo in SW Sicily, which may have been in Sicily since the late 15th century or earlier. These are now in the Galleria Reggionale in Palermo and the Instituto de Valencia de Don Juan in Madrid (see Jarrones de la Alhambra, cat. nos. 7 and 9). They have been dated to the late 13th to early 14th century, indicating a possible date for this lid.",
