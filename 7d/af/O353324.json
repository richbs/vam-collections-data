            "public_access_description": "A small number of leather vestments have survived which appear to date from the late 17th and early 18th century. Leather is not an obvious material to make vestments from, because of its stiffness, weight and therefore awkwardness and discomfort in wear. But when the surface was raised by stamping or embossing, and then decorated with gilding and silvering, and painting with other colours, its visual effect could be very rich and fine.\n\nThe art of decorating leather in this way originated in Spain, but spread to many European countries, in particular the Netherlands. Leather vestments are usually associated with German or Italian manufacture, although there is no clear consensus on this. The most spectacular example to have survived, a cope originally used in Saig in the Black Forest region of Germany and now in the Badisches Landesmuseum, Karlsruhe, may be German, but a comparison of its design with Italian velvets suggests an Italian origin is also possible.",
