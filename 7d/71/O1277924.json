The Soviet jet has been included to show the mirroring of weaponry of the Cold War Period.  Jet planes were first developed during the Second World War, but it was during the Cold War that major innovations were put into use.  It was essential for both sides to constantly update their plane technology, both for delivering a potential attack and to defend against it. Both sides developed supersonic jets that were capable of delivering nuclear bombs, intercepting aircraft or patrolling near enemy airspace.  The public were captivated by the power of the jet age and many toy companies, such as Dinky, made accurate scale toys of the real things for children to play with at home.\nToys and games have been used to recruit, normalise or to instil a sense of militarism in children. This has been evident in war toys made for children for hundreds of years and is one of the key messages for the exhibition.  These toys work within the permanent collection to show the extent to which messages, values and ideas can be instilled to directly to children through their playthings",
