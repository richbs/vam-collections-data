Not only do we have the evidence of its size to support this, but also the finished nature of its execution and sustained power of imaginative force. \nIn the summer months of 1800 Girtin was touring in Yorkshire, staying for a time as the guest of his patron Edward Lascelles at Harewood. <i>Kirkstall</i>probably derives from sketches made during this tour, perhaps being worked up that winter on his return to London. \n\nGirtin's subject matter is consistently topographical, and always depicts specific places. However, the present picture demonstrates the crucial change in his expressive aims that distinguishes his late work from the topographic tradition. Whereas formerly his approach had concentrated on the fabric of the building, here we find a new interest in atmospheric effects that are intended to heighten our melancholia in apprehending the scene. Approaching sunset shadows everything in autumnal browns inducing a pensive mood, and the tower, conceived as a ruin dramatically silhouetted against heavy cloud, by careful choice of angle, is reduced to one wall that frames an area of mellow evening sky. In achieving this dramatic configuration Girtin has not been over-concerned with topographical accuracy, rather his concentration has been upon an evocation of his own emotional responses. Thus, although we are viewing from the south, he depicts the low light of the setting sun as emanating from behind the tower; in reality it would be shining from the direction indicated by the east-west axis of the nave. \nMoreover, the belfry window has been enlarged - he gives it an extra sixth light. Enclosing delicate tracery resembling that of an east window, the tower now seems to have a transient fragility not present in the actual sturdy structure. \n\nBy including contemporary incident - the strollers and their dog, a haystack and smoke from the part of the ruin that had by then been converted into a farmhouse - we are invited to contrast the present with the medieval past, in so doing perhaps reflecting upon mortality: \n\n<i>'The great projecter of these haughty piles, \nWith all his riches, honours and renoun, \nHides his poor head in dust - and is no more !'</i> \n\n(Lines addressed to a Company of Young Persons, whilst viewing the Ruins of Kirkstall Abbey, C Cayley, c.1798) \n\nGirtin was to make one further water-colour of the Abbey (J H Mayne, <i>Girtin</i>, pl.4), a closer view of 1802. He died in November that year aged 27.\n\nChristopher Titterington\"\n<u>Vikutoria & Arub?to Bijutsukan-z? : eikoku romanshugi kaigaten = The Romantic tradition in British painting, 1800-1950 : masterpieces from the Victoria and Albert Museum / selected by Mark Evans</u> [Japan : Brain Trust], 2002. 185 p. : ill.
