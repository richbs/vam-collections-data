On the left of the house is a single storey extension with a pitched roof. Behind the extension is a conservatory. The house is set on a table base. There are four rooms at the back and each quarter of the back wall opens to reveal one room. The front opens out in four sections to show a small front room, hallway, staircase and bathroom and lavatory. The extension opens in two sections to reveal a kitchen and utility room. The windows open outwards and are made of metal and celluloid to represent leaded panes. The house is wired for electricity with four switches at the back of the base.",
