The first part of the book has fabric swatches as illustrations of Jacquard weaving techniques, as compiled by Lyon apprentices on Weaving treatise of the 19th century, with instructions in French. This section is followed by a series of unexplained swatches similar in quality to those in the first section. There are some loose swatches stuffed between two of these pages. They are unlikely to be contemporary with those mounted in the book, as colours, patterns, and weight of fabric are all different. There are also some oddly-shaped swatches stuck onto a pay sheet from the Locomotive Department, New Cross. The pay sheet appears to date from the 1840s, but the bright plaids of some of the swatches are more suggestive of the 1860s.",
