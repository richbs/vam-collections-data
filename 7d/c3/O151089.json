Dr Alwyn and Mrs Angela Cox, <u>Swinton Creamware and Pearlware</u>, c. 1770-1820. p. 116 'The earliest known documentary record of creamware having been sold from the Swinton Pottery occurs on an invoice dated 12 June 1770 sent to the 2nd Marquis of Rockingham. The price is given in pre-decimal shillings and pence: <i>2 Pair of Cream Colr Sauce Boats 1s 4d</i>. They were ordered by Mrs Broughton possibly the Housekeeper at Wentworth and cost 4d each. A substantially complete plain creamware sauceboat with moulded flutes and rococo-scroll decoration recovered from the Pottery site (fig. 5) may be similar to the ones supplied to Wentworth House. Included in the same invoice are other wares intended for the household, kitchens and garden. A sauceboat of about the same date with moulded rococo-scroll decoration and attractively enhanced with coloured glazes (fig 6 <i>C.8-1940</i>) is in the collections of the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum. The handle terminals identically match examples recovered fro the Swinton site (fig 7); additionally, other than for the feather-edge border, the fluting and other moulded details correspond to those on the excavated sauceboat illustrated above.'",
