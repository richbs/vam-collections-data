With Robert Heritage having won a record eleven Design Council Awards for products he designed.\n\nThe Lytespan 7 track system provided a new versatile lighting system for commercial  and residential interiors. Its multi-functional design allowed for different lighting, diffused, accent, kinetic and in addition audio-visual equipment could be run and controlled separately from one Lytespan 7 track. \n\nThe Pan Parabolic light fitting is also unique in that it does not use expensive bulbs. The bulb is placed sideways to gain extra efficiency which would compensate for the greater shielding required to avoid direct light from the bulb. For maximum efficiency the Pan Parabolic is fitted with a device for twisting the bulb and holder to adjust the filament to its best possible position.",
