Silver toys like this one copied the exact details and proportions of normal sized pieces and came in a variety of subjects and sizes, ranging from domestic utensils to elaborate furniture.  \n\nThere are several explanations for them. They might have been intended to furnish dolls\u2019 houses. They might have been miniature trade samples. They might have been practice pieces for apprentices. They might have been fashionable novelties for adults to collect or they might simply have been playthings for rich children. In 1571, the daughter of Henry II of France ordered a set of small silver \u2018pots, bowls, plates and other articles\u2019 to give to a royal child.\n\nThis piece was made in the Netherlands. Because they were light and small, silver toys are not fully hallmarked. The form of the maker\u2019s or retailer\u2019s mark helps to date them.",
