            "public_access_description": "Rupert Potter (1832-1914), father of the children's writer and illustrator Beatrix Potter (1866-1943), took up  photography in the 1860s when it was still a relatively new art form.  An enthusiastic and skilled amateur, he  was elected to the Photographic Society of London in 1869 and later contributed to photographic exhibitions.    Rupert assisted the artist Sir John Everett Millais (1829-1896), a close friend, by photographing backgrounds  for paintings and sitters for portraits. His favourite subject, however, was Beatrix herself and his prolific legacy   of several hundred photographs forms a broad pictorial account of her life from infancy to marriage.\n\nRupert was also a skilled landscape photographer.  During the Potter family's extended summer holidays to  Scotland and the Lake District it was Beatrix's delight to accompany her father on photographic expeditions.   He photographed in particular the countryside around Eastwood in Dunkeld, Wray Castle near Ambleside  and Lingholm on the edge of Derwentwater.  This photograph depicts a view of a river bank covered in trees, taken on 18 August 1899 during the Potter family's summer retreat to Lingholm, a house overlooking Derwentwater in Cumbria.\n\nExcited by the possibilities of the new art form, Beatrix too became an avid photographer, inheriting one of her   father\u2019s old cameras, 'a most inconveniently heavy article which he refuses to use, and which has been   breaking my back since I took to that profession.' (Journal, Friday 19th April 1895).  Beatrix went on to employ   photography in the service of her own art and, like Millais, she photographed details, particularly in the Lake   District landscapes, that she later incorporated in her imaginative book illustrations.",
