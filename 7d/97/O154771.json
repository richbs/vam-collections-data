Maria delle Grazie in Milan (about 1496-7), but is shown in reverse. It was possibly copied from an engraving, a technique which reproduces the design in reverse when printed. The subject was commonly found in monastic refectories (or dining rooms) and this relief may have come from the refectory of San Francesco at Barga, in the area of Lucca. \n\nGiovanni della Robbia was one of three of the sons of Andrea della Robbia (1435-1525) to enter his father's workshop. He received his own commissions from 1497 and increasingly took over the running of the workshop.",
