            "history_note": "This bronze was cast using the indirect method, with a wax-to-wax join at the neck visible in X-radiography. The dark brown lacquer, pooled in streaks along the horse's flank, is possibly a later application. The tail, which is hollow on the inside, has been loosely reattached at the wrong angle, which suggests it may not be original.  The presence of the reins and girth suggests that the horse was originally intended to have a rider, although it is not possible to ascertain if a figure of this type was ever added.  The reins appear to have been added after the making of the horse but judging from the treatment of its surface, the inset rectangular plug that hides the hole on the back, appears to be original.\n\nThe statuette is of excellent quality, thinly chiselled, particularly in the rings of the reins and in the mane; and the veins are carefully modelled.  However, the bulbous eyes are left without pupils, the teeth are not defined, the mouth is lacking a tongue, and the nails are not visible on the horseshoes, details that we usually see in the monumental bronzes produced in the workshop of Giambologna.  The model lacks the vivacity of versions by Giambologna where the powerful nature of the animal, its frontal posture and the apparently controlled step, combined with the vigorous modelling of the head, confer greater visual impact to the work, alluding rather to the regal monumentality of a large equestrian sculpture.\n\n(See Motture, P. in <font i>Giambologna: the gods, the heroes</font>, 2006, p. 276)\n\nHistorical significance: The signature on this small bronze, apparently added in the wax before casting - is of particular significance as it proclaims Susini's role in the design both of the independent statuette and, it seems, in the other equestrian monuments.",

            "historical_context_note": "This bronze is signed by the Florentine, Antonio Susini, who was employed in the workshop of  Giambologna from 1580 until l600, at which point he set up his own studio nearby. The horse demonstrates a formal development regarding the design of  Giambologna's equestrian monument of Cosimo I, in whose execution Susini had played an important role. However, it is closer in form to the monuments of Ferdinand de' Medici and above all to Henry IV of France, that originally stood on the Pont-Neuf in Paris (1604-1611; destroyed in 1792). Susini\u2019s horse is identical to the bronze horse of Henry IV, of which a copy is today conserved in Dijon (Mus\u00e9e Des Beaux-Arts). The signature on the underbelly of the work, which closely resembles that on the \u2018Farnese Bull\u2019 bronzes, is of particular importance as it makes the statuette an important document for the style of Susini, much of whose work is overshadowed by Giambologna. Susini would therefore have had more motive to ensure that the signature of this piece was recorded as it would have been one of the first small equestrian statuettes. The work has also been associated with two designs, now in the Uffizi, attributed to Cigoli, who was involved with the artist in the initial phases of Cosimo I, although the extent of his collaboration is still not clear.",
