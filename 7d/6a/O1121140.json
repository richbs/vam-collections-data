In terms of clothing, this led to the rejection of many of the fashionable garments of the era and a preference for particular historical, artistic or traditional forms\n\nIn some respects aesthetic clothing for children was far more long-lived than that for adults. Although some parents did go so far as to dress boys in the type of costume favoured by Oscar Wilde, with knee breeches and lace-trimmed jacket, few in the UK would dress a boy over the age of eight or nine in the aesthetic style.  By far the most prevalent form of aesthetic garment for children was the smock dress for girls and younger children.  Smocking in girl's dresses remained popular for much of the twentieth century and also transferred to other garments such as romper suits.",
