It comprises the shaped body, cut with a groove for the tail, four legs, the head, ears and a panel at the neck.  The legs and tail are individually nailed to the body.  The ears are nailed to the head and the head itself is on a spike which passes through the rectangular panel and into the body.  The head is shaped with the muzzle painted black to show the nose and mouth; ears are large iron tacks.  The head and body are made from blocks of wood 1\u00bdin thick (3.8cm) and the legs, tail and ears are \u00bdin thick (1.3cm).\nAll the parts are slightly shaped and will swivel so the dog can be posed, however, the leg nails are loose and the dog usually collaspes when stood up.",
