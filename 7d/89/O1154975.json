            "public_access_description": "This is one of many pen and Indian ink cartoons drawn by William Kerridge Haselden (1872-1953) and reproduced in the magazine Punch from 1906 until 1936. Haselden was a self-taught artist who produced both political and theatrical cartoons, originally for Sovereign magazine from 1902-1903 and in 1904 for the next 31 years for the Daily Mirror. He was offered a knighthood by Stanley Baldwin but turned it down because he 'didn't want all that fuss'.\n\nNorah Blaney and Gwen Farrar first worked together at the end of the First World War, entertaining the troops in Belgium and France with Lena Ashwell's concert party, with Norah Blaney as the pianist and Gwen Farrar as a cellist, performing with a constant flow of repartee. They appeared in leading London and variety theatres between about 1921 to 1924, as well as in the 1921 cabaret show Pot Luck! with Jack Hulbert and Beatrice Lillie; and the 1923 Andr\u00e9 Charlot revues Rats starring Alfred Lester and Gertrude Lawrence, and Yes! at the Vaudeville Theatre, Strand, London. In May 1924 they opened in another Charlot revue The Punch Bowl at the Duke of York's Theatre, London, with Alfred Lester, Sonnie Hale and Hermione Baddeley. They worked independently in the late 1920s but came together in 1930 for this production. They made a farewell appearance at the London Palladium in February 1932 but worked together again briefly to entertain the troops during the Second World War before the death of Gwen Farrar in 1944.",
