As well as being crucial records of the history of the V&A, and an important element within the National Art Library's visual encyclopaedia, these photographs are also significant artefacts in the history of the art of photography.\n\nCharles Thurston was the first official photographer employed by the South Kensington Museum. He was appointed in 1856. His subject here is a carved English mirror.  Relying upon natural light, Thompson photographed this object outdoors, inadvertently including his camera and the surrounding landscape, reflected in the mirror.  Curious is the fact that the photographer himself is not present in the reflection (as in the case in other photographs of mirrors taken by Thompson).  Most probably, Thompson removed himself from the frame at the beginning of the exposure, which would have necessarily been very long,returning into the frame momentarily in order to cover the lens.  As a result, his image did not visibly register on the glass negative.",
