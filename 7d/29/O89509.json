            "physical_description": "Painting, in opaque watercolour and gold on paper, the lower part of the painting shows a princess sitting at the foot of a tree being entertained by four kneeling female musicians, one of whom holds a vina, two are shown clapping and a third holds out a hand, perhaps to accompany her song, although her mouth is shown closed.. They are placed in a landscape of bushes, low trees and green hillocks which jut out into a sheet of water animated by white water fowl. The heads of two swimming deer, two ducks, a turban-headed swimmer and a small  pin-figure punting in a long, narrow boat have been added in grey on the main stretch of open water, possibly at a later date. The water zig-zags down on the left and curves round the bank on which the ladies are seated.  The top of the painting is dominated by orange clouds above a gold setting sunburst with golden rays.\n     The princess is seated in a posture of royal ease on a pink carpet with a gold border.  Her right arm rests on her raised right knee while her other leg is crossed in front and her left hand rests outspread on a floral-patterned small cushion placed in front of a  green bolster and a further blue cushion behind her.  She is wearing a gold and red tall rimless cap with an inlaid pearl and jewelled headband, a gold fringe tassel at the back and a black brush tassel at the front.  She is dressed in tight orange<i>paijama</i> with gold spots and stripes under a brown <i>peshwaz</i> with golden seams, over a bright pink <i>choli</i>. She has a wealth of pearl and gem jewellery including  ropes of pearls crossing over her upper body.   A number of vessels for wine drinking are laid on the carpet in front of her and on the grass between her and the musicians. A pearl necklace with interspersed green and red gemstones also lies by her side.\n       The inner frame to the painting has gold lines outlined in black (the outer one being broader) either side of strips of orangey-buff paper decorated with a stylised floral scroll, heightened with two white lines. A further dark blue line is inscribed on the main outer border, which is decorated with a row of red poppies and pink lilies outlined and detailed in gold on the plain ivory-coloured ground of the page.  The page has a narrow gold line between black lines on the inner side of strips of buff-coloured paper with an inner white line, over which a thin red wash has been later applied in a rough fashion on the three outer sides.  The inner side has a strip of crimson paper overlaid the buff-coloured margin and continued down into the gutter of the binding.",

The binding is covered with an Indian brocade silk that may have been cut from lengths brought home by the 2nd Lord Clive, who served as Governor of Madras, 1799 to 1803.
