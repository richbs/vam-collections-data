By this time, the potters at the imperial and private kilns of Jingdezhen already mastered the use of the pink enamel, which was introduced in the colour palette for decorating glass, enamelled metals and porcelain in about 1720. Due to the predominance of pink, this type of porcelain was called famille rose by European collectors of the mid 1800s.\n\nThis dish is decorated with a domestic scene of a young lady sitting in a room with children, a popular theme of the Yongzheng period. The ruby colour on the back is also characteristic of this kind production.",
