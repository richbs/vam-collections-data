First studied music in the Westminster Abbey choir, then painting with John Hoppner RA; entered RA Schools 1797. Exhibited 129 works at the RA between 1799 and 1844, and 14 at the BI 1806-38. A few early exhibits were portraits, but he soon achieved success with picturesque landscapes influenced by Gainsborough and 17th-century Dutch painting. From about 1815 exhibited principally coastal and marine subjects; his work was compared to that of Aelbert Cuyp and, especially, Turner, with whom he had a close association. Also painted classical landscapes in the manner of Claude, and a variety of genre, humorous, literary and historical subjects. Travelled abroad, notably in 1827-8 following his marriage to Maria Graham, a writer of art and travel books and most famous for <i>Little Arthur's History of England</i> (1835). Elected ARA 1806, RA 1810, knighted 1837. Served on committees for the Government Schools of Design and the National Gallery, and was appointed Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures 1843. Died Kensington 25 November 1844; his studio sales of drawings and watercolours were at Christie's 8-12 May 1845 and 22 June 1863. Although in his lifetime his work commanded high prices and attracted the leading patrons of the day, it was not always well received by the critics, particularly in later years; Ruskin wrote that 'he painted everything tolerably, and nothing excellently'. \n\nLIT: <i>\tAthenaeum</i> 17 December 1831, pp817-8, 30 November 1844, pp1097-8 (obit); <i>Art Union</i> 1845, p15 (obit); <i>Art Journal</i> 1856, p9, 1866, p99, 1896, p334; J Dafforne <i>Pictures of Sir A W Callcott</i> ... nd [1875] (referred to below as Dafforne); <i>Portfolio</i> 1875, p161; DB Brown <i>Augustus Wall Callcott</i> Tate Gallery exhibition catalogue 1981 (with full bibliography and list of archival sources) (referred to below as Brown) \n\n<b>Falstaff and Simple</b> \nFA12 Neg V1936 \nPaper on canvas, 45.1 x 37.5 cm (l7\u00be x 14\u00be ins) \nSheepshanks Gift 1857\n \nExhibited at the BI in 1835, and listed in the printed handlist of the Sheepshanks collection of about 1850. The size is given in the BI catalogue at '26 by 24 inches', including the frame. \n\nThe title of the work in the BI catalogue is also recorded on a label on the backboard in the artist's hand: \n\nNo 1/Falstaff when escaping from Ford's house/in the disguise of the Old Woman of Brainford [Brentford]/is followed by Simple to know if Slender/is to have Ann Page or no./Falstaff. It is his fortune to have her/or no. Go say the woman told/me so. Simple. May I be so bold as say so sit?/A W Callcott.   \n\nThe subject is from Shakespeare's <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i> act 4 scene 5.
