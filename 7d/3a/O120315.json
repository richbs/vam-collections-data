Although pieces of this type were produced in quantity, there is very little that can be firmly established about the workshops which made them.  Some idea of date of manufacture is provided by parallels with European furniture; large multiple-drawer cabinets without doors or a fall-front, and mounted on stands, were very much in fashion in the second half of the seventeenth century.   High-style European furniture of that period is also characterised by intarsia of a variety of types, including \u2018seaweed\u2019 marquetry, named after the intricate interlacing designs and dense arabesques that were inlaid.  Although these are possible influences, Indo-Portuguese cabinets of this type are also characterised by wholly distinctive elements such abstracted animal and geometric designs which have no precedent in any one European or Indian tradition.  The scrolling legs, for instance, derive from seventeenth-century Iberian furniture, but are inlaid with bird forms that scholars have associated with jatayu, king of the vultures and a central character in the Ramayana.  The materials, inlay and intricately pierced mounts on cabinets of this type bear an affinity with fitted chests of drawers and cabinets in the Sacristy of the Basilica of Bom Jesus, Old Goa.  This was built in 1654 and it was likely that the cabinets were constructed shortly afterwards.",
