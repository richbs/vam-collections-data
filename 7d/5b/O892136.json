Bianchi,<i> I Gandolfi</i>, Rome 1936, p.147, no. 52, is a Death of St Joseph, formerly the property of Dr Moreschi (mentioned by Oretti in MS B.105, p. 225, in the Biblioteca Comunale, Bologna). Signora Bianchi also lists a black chalk drawing of the same subject by Gaetano Gandolfi in the possession of Dr Ercole Casanova (<i>loc. cit</i>., p. 170, no. 45). But the Museum\u2019s drawing is perhaps closer to Ubaldo than to Gaetano. The curved pen lines drawn by the artist to show the shape of an ornamental frame round the composition, prove that the drawing was a study for a picture that was intended to be inset in a wall panel or altar piece.",
