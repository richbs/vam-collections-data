The Protestant churches do not consider it canonical, and thus is not included in their Bible, although it did appear in the King James version of 1611.\n\nSusannah was the righteous wife of Joachim of Babylon, a wealthy man. Joachim permitted the wise elders of the community to use his garden to meet and discuss the legal matters of the land. It was there that Susannah came to the notice of two elders, who hid in the garden until her maids left to fetch her washing things. The elders threatened to accuse Susannah of adultery if she did not sleep with them. Susannah chose not to sin and refused their advances, so the two elders denounced her in a public assembly. The assembly called for her death, for they did not believe that the elders could lie, because of their age and position. Susannah prayed to God, who sent the wise young Daniel to arbitrate on her behalf. By separating the two elders and getting contradictory testimony during cross-examination, Daniel was able to demonstrate that they had lied. The assembly then condemned the elders to death, and Susannah was exonerated.\n\nThis scene is often displayed in government-related contexts as a reminder to judge wisely and honestly.\n\nHere Susannah is depicted fully clothed, which is the medieval tradition.
