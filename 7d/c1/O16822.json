            "public_access_description": "Tiny, bee shaped buttons fasten the bodice of this pale blue evening dress. The sweeping, romantic gown was bought in 1972 to wear as a wedding dress. Bill Gibb\u2019s personal \u2018signature\u2019 motif was a bee and it appears on many outfits he designed in the form of embroidered and appliqu\u00e9d details, belt clasps and buttons. These particular metal bees are enamelled, and fasten through machine-worked buttonholes. Precision made, they stand out clearly against the plain moss crepe fabric, providing a jewel-like focus.\nThe front and back bodice of this dress has double topstitched seams, echoing the rows of alternating black and yellow topstitching on the flared cuffs, collar and hem, and picking up the bee colours. Long dolman sleeves button at the writs with three additional bees which fasten through loops in matching fabric. A similar dress, but in ivory, was described as \u2018Bill Gibb\u2019s Evening Spectacular\u2019 in Vogue, in October 1972.",
