Despite the landscape background, the stylistic grounds for attributing the Burghley miniature to Hoskins are not compelling, but on general probability a connection with Hoskins is a fair inference. From the apparent age and costume of the sitter a dating in the later 1630s seems right, and the portrait type is Van Dyckian (similar images attributed to Van Dyck are at Goodwood, Boughton, Courteenhall, etc.}.' Miniatures of the 1630s and 1640s connected with Van Dyck are usually given to Hoskins (see note to Cat. Nos 36-8). In this case at least one of the group of miniatures is signed <i>IH. Fec</i>. (2) \n\nIn the circumstances of the 1630s, however, some commissions for replicas of the Prince Charles, portrait were apparently put out to Des Granges and produced in his name. For example, a version Signed <i>DDG</i> and dated 1643 was sold at Christie's in 1974.(3)There is also a fragmentary <i>DDG</i> signature (which has usually been assumed to be false) on the NPG version. This and other directly comparable versions, such as those in the Buccleuch and Bayne-Powell Collections, and also the present miniature, are reminiscent of Des Granges in the soft blended modelling of the face, in the painting of the hair, and in their overall tonality. Given the somewhat protean quality of Des Granges' Signed miniatures, work in this soft blended style is probably acceptable as within his range, especially when he was working on an image also produced by Hoskins. Perhaps he broadened his handling in the interests of speed, for the work is, though fine, less minute than in Cat. Nos 48 and 50 [HH394-1948; HH380-1948]. It is interesting to compare the miniature with that in the NPG of Charles I, of roughly similar date, (4) which also relates to Hoskins and has a landscape background. \n \nThis image of Prince Charles enjoyed an extended currency owing to the absence of the Court from London, where most of the painters and miniaturists - except Des Granges - remained during the l640s. It was not apparently superseded until the Hanneman portrait of c.1650, of which a beautiful derivation by Des Granges is at Ham House (Cat. No. 50). \n\n1  See photos in NPG files. \n2  Duke ofLeeds, Sotheby's 3 July 1961, lot 75. \n3  22 October 1974, lot 68, bt Fraser, 2,000 gns.\n4  Murdoch 1981, fig. 150. \"",
