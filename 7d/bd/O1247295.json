The bumper at the front of the train is bright red, and both ends have hooks to connect the locomotive to other components.\n[Tender] Dark green painted metal, with a black top and gold coloured bumpers. There is also a paper concertina on the back of the model, presumably to stop collisions with other vehicles. There is a pin attached to the front to attach it to other vehicles.\n[Box Base] The exterior of the box is pale green, with some markings indicating wear. The interior of the box is ochre in colour. The box is rectangular in shape.\n[Box Lid] The box lid is missing one of its sides, and is severely discoloured, probably because of light. There are two half circles cut into two of the sides to assist with removing the lid.",
