The top half of the certificate is occupied by a patriotic illustration: three children (a little boy in a sailor suit, a girl in a striped smock dress, and a boy in a blazer and shorts) are being escorted along a colonnade by a woman in classical dress who is holding a book (and probably represents Learning); in the background are the Houses of Parliament and the Palace of Westminster.   The children are approaching a crowned  woman in a red cloak (representing Wisdom, enthroned among attributes which include books, a globe and an inkwell) who holds a spray of laurels in her hand as a prize, and is accompanied by the figure of Britannia holding a sword rather than the more usual trident; also present are male representatives of the Army, the Navy and the Flying Corps.  Beneath the illustration is a squared panel headed 'LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL', with the LCC coat of arms and spaces for the name of the winner's school and dept (Queens Hd St , Infants); the wording continues ' THE AWARD OF PRIZES HAVING BEEN SUSPENDED BY THE COUNCIL DURING THE GREAT WAR, THIS CERTIFICATE IS GIVEN TO (Catherine Hawes) FOR GOOD CONDUCT AND MERITORIOUS WORK DURING THE EDUCATIONAL YEAR 1916-17'.  The certificate is signed by A A Wing, Catherine's headmistress, with the facsimile signatures of the Chairmen of the Council and the Education Committee.  The central panel is flanked by two narrow panels decorated with motifs of learning, such as laurel wreaths, geometrical instruments and writing implements.",
