The plate is kept in shape by a double row of wires, which pass around the bottle and bifurcate as they reach the plate.  In the centre of the double row, a hinged strip rises vertically to join the collar.  Domed lid with flat border and a shaped finial decorated with leaves and two rows of pellets, with a cabochon chrysoprase set in the top, supported on a tubular sheath and surrounded by spiralling wires.  The tube conceals a screw fitting which passes through a cork and is secured by a nut attached to a circular silver plate and shielded by a loop of silver, rounded on the outside.",

Ashbee (1863-1942), is a type of late Victorian glass decanter sold as a claret jug. All but the cheapest of these were decorated by faceting or cutting. Ashbee's design is distinctive in that it is much plainer.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe decanter is simply constructed: the silver wires are soldered into place without disguise or refinement. The ornament is concentrated around the finial (decorative knob). Otherwise the metal is left plain. The hammer marks on the surface bear witness to the fact that it was handmade.  The green glass bottle was manufactured by James Powell & Sons of Whitefriars, London. Their version was more fragile and elegant than the Elizabethan prototype.\n\nDesign & Designing\nAshbee designed different versions of this decanter, based on the form of an Elizabethan bottle discovered during the building of his house, the Magpie and Stump, in Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, London.  The site had once been an Elizabethan hostelry. Ashbee is quoted as saying, 'it was doubtless bottles of that shape, good solid glass, from which Falstaff [a character in William Shakespeare's plays] and his worthies drank their sack [sherry]'. This romantic view of history was a characteristic feature of the Arts and Crafts Movement.",
