            "public_access_description": "Barry Martin (born 1943) is a graduate of Goldsmith\u2019s College and of St Martin\u2019s School of Art, both especially influential in the 1960s when he was studying there. He has worked in various media \u2013 including kinetic sculpture, film, performance, and the making of environments \u2013 but the constant in his work has been drawing, either as a working tool, as a means of recording and observing, or as an end in itself. For Martin, drawing is a system of signs analogous to those of language, and also an intellectual process of enquiry, analysis and proposition. \n\nThis drawing, and another from the same series (E.321-2006), are self-portraits of the artist at Chiswick House (and are part of a larger series on this theme). Barry Martin has had a studio in the grounds of Chiswick House (now owned and managed by English Heritage) for the past 16 years, and is effectively \u2018artist-in-residence\u2019 in a very literal and established sense. Martin researched the aspects of Masonic symbolism which are incorporated into the house, hence the \u2018collar\u2019 he wears in one of these drawings, which is marked with Masonic emblems and signs. Both pictures feature aspects and views of the house, inside and out, combined in vertiginous perspectives; each is ambiguous, with images that can be interpreted as views, reflections or even manifestations of the artist\u2019s imagination. Each is in black and white, densely worked and intense, creating a brooding surreal atmosphere.",
