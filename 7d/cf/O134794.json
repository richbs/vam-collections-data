He painted both portraits and landscapes. The influence of Impressionism is evident in his work, and he was attracted by the problems of suggesting the fleeting effects of light in the medium of oil paint. \n\nThe South Kensington Museum underwent a major building programme between 1899 and 1909, when the architect Aston Webb was commissioned to provide new fa\u00e7ades for the Exhibition Road and Brompton Road frontages and a grand entrance. On the occasion of Queen Victoria laying the foundation stone for this new building in 1899 it was renamed the Victoria and Albert Museum to commemorate the support given to its foundation by the Prince Consort. This building work attracted a number of artists. A pen and ink drawing of the Brompton Road frontage in 1906 by Louis Weirter in the collection (D.655-1906) shows scaffolding covering the whole of the front of the museum, including the dome.",
