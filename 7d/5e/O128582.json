A Portuguese branch of the order was founded in 1290. In 1862 this order became an Order of Merit awarded to Portuguese and foreigners for achievement or noted service in the fields of science, literature and the arts. Membership of the Order was awarded to John Charles Robinson (1824-1913), curator, scholar and collector, who worked at the V&A in its earliest days and was a very important figure in the formation of the collections. This cloth badge in the form of the Order of Sant' Iago was given to him in his lifetime. It was perhaps made for stitching to a cloak or other garment to signify the owner's membership of the Order.",
