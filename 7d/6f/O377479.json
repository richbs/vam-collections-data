It was worn at the front of the neck, attached on each side to a light gauze scarf made from black silk.  The richest women wore clasps made of silver filigree, but this one is made from thin silver-plated metal, stamped to imitate the more expensive filigree.  The brown rosettes under the coloured pastes are meant to look like silver-gilt.  The women in this region often wore chokers of various kinds, to hide the ugly swelling of goitre, which was endemic in the area, due to the lack of iodine in the diet.  \n\nThis one was bought for eight shillings and five pence at the International Exhibition, London, 1872.",
