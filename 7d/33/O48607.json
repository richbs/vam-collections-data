There is a label inside the box which indicates that the initials 'EH' refer to Edward Hyde Lord Clarendon, but there is nothing on record to verify this. Along with the inscription: virgo fecit @ Sheffield 1653 on the horn on the inside of the lid, there is another inscription in a different (later?) hand of three letter, possibly f u t, but it is nearly indecipherable.",

Two of the mother-of-pearl circles set in red wax resin on the lid contain the initials E and H but the original owner remains a mystery.  \n\nMaker\nThe lid is lined with a disc of horn inscribed Virgo fecit @ Shefield 1653 ('Virgo made [this] at Sheffield, 1653').  The inscription may be a pun on the name Maden or Madin because  virgo is Latin for 'maiden'.  A family of cutlers with this surname was working in Sheffield in the late 17th century. Perhaps this brassmaker was one of their forebears.\n\nUse\nTobacco first came into general use in western Europe around 1570. It was highly prized for its medicinal and narcotic properties and by the 1630s was used by all classes, despite its cost. Snuff was formed from fermented tobacco, mixed with various combinations of perfumed oils, herbs or spices into a compressed block. It was then grated to make a fine powder ready for inhalation. Snuff was taken by both sexes, though women tended to use it privately.  \n\nHistorical Associations\nAll the brass cases by 'Virgo' date to the Commonwealth period.  They were probably made specifically for Royalist supporters. The cryptic inscriptions in Latin were an ingenious way of concealing the maker's identity when Royalist sympathies were unfashionable and dangerous. Also, both lavish decoration of this box and the very habit of taking snuff were condemned by the Puritans.",
