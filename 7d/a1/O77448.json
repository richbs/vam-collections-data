In 1697 he was appointed assistant engraver to the Royal Mint, and in 1705 became Chief Engraver, a post he held until his death. Croker produced 29 different medals during Queen Anne's reign (1702-14). Many were struck to celebrate the successful military engagements undertaken by the British in the wars against the French.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe medal was struck in bronze. Struck medals were produced from metal dies engraved with the design in reverse. A flat disc was placed between the dies, which were then compressed, so that the design was reproduced on the metal. This technique meant that a high number of medals could be made using the same dies over and over, whereas the technique of casting medals was generally more complex and therefore usually suitable only for smaller numbers.",
