The garment has a full length inverted conical opening [ie. no cross over] with a reinforced neckband in same fabric.  It is formed of one back panel seamed at the shoulder with various shaped inserts back and front to form a seamed but edged hipped outline. The long sleeves are set at right angles to the main panels but left open/unseamed joining onto the open gusset.  A short loop linking the sleeve edges is placed at the elbow area using the facing silk. The sleeve tapers slightly to a central pointed cuff. Both shoulder seams show the ends of the loom piece: 4 green wefts either side of 6 yellow wefts.\nThe main silk is a deep yellow silk twill patterned with a small stylised boteh motif in crimson and blue with pink-brown details and green leaves.  Arranged in offset rows, one row facing left and the next facing right.  The weft floats on the back.\nWarp: yellow Z-twist silk\nWeft: silk, orange, pink, red, blue, green, brown: Z-twist\nThe facings are black silk.\nLining: plain weave cotton, white ground printed with oval-shaped floral sprays.  Light green leaves, dark green stems and flowers and buds in red, pink, yellow and purple.  A small unbacked independent pocket is placed high on the right front and a larger pocket is on the left hand side.  Both are made from the lining fabric.",
