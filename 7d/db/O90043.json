The Flemish industry had a skilled work force and produced the finest linen thread. It was proficient at both following and anticipating the market, including the exacting demands of the French nobility, and benefited from its geographical position and contact with trade routes. \n\nFlemish bobbin lace was the major fashion lace between the 1630s and the 1660s. It held its position by undergoing a series of changes; from the 1630s onwards, the trade was able to produce whatever lace was applicable to the current fashion. The pot of flowers motif, particularly popular in that decade, was perfectly suited to the deep scallops which decorated falling bands. The size of scallops subsequently diminished, to become a straight edge by the mid 1650s. Wide falling bands were replaced in men\u2019s wear by bib-fronted bands, and for women by deep bands (collars) which displayed perfectly the subtle patterns of Flemish bobbin lace,  like this example.",

From the main centres of production in Italy and Flanders it was traded widely across Europe, and the industry responded quickly to changes in fashionable dress, as different styles came in and out of  favour.\n\nBy the 1630s, Flemish bobbin lace, with its fine draping qualities, dominated the market. The Flemish industry had a skilled work force and produced the finest linen thread. It was proficient at both following and anticipating the market, including the exacting demands of the French nobility, and benefited from its geographical position and contact with trade routes. Most Italian bobbin lace in this period was fairly heavy, used for furnishings, vestments, the trimming of heavy velvet clothes and large collars. By contrast Flemish bobbin lace was light and delicate, made with finer thread, and more open patterns. In the age of cutwork early in the century it had been a cheaper option, but now its elaborate designs and fine threads made the best-quality pieces as expensive as Italian needle lace. \n\nFlemish bobbin lace remained the major fashion lace until the 1660s. It held its position by undergoing a series of changes; from the 1630s onwards, the trade was able to produce whatever lace was applicable to the current fashion. The pot of flowers motif, particularly popular in that decade, was perfectly suited to the deep scallops which decorated falling bands. The size of scallops subsequently diminished, to become a straight edge by the mid 1650s. Wide falling bands were replaced in men\u2019s wear by bib-fronted bands, and for women by deep collars, which displayed perfectly the subtle patterns of Flemish bobbin lace like this example.",
