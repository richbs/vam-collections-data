She was encouraged in the enterprise by Sir Hans Sloane, the physician and collector, and took lodgings near the Chelsea Physic Garden in order to have her subjects to hand. She drew, engraved and coloured the plates herself, and the publication was a commercial success.\n\nIn the earliest printed herbals the text rarely refers to the illustrations so the reader must make the connection bewteen the two. In 'A Curious Herbal' the various parts are labelled. This practice came not from herbals but from other kinds of botanical publication that had established the importance of identifying each part.",
