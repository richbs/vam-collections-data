In 1825 he went to Rome where he studied pre-Raphaelite art and originated that school of painting in England with his 'Madonna and Child' in 1828. He was elected F.R.S of Edinburgh, 1832 and Professor of Fine Arts, Kings College London in 1844 where he delivered, and subsequently published a lecture on the 'Theory of the Fine Arts'. He became a Royal Academician in 1848.\n\nGeorge Gammon Adams (b. 1821-1898) was a portrait sculptor and medallist. He designed and exhibited prize medals for the Great Exhibition. In 1852 he was chosen to model the death mask of Wellington. One of his public monuments is the 'Napier' statue in Trafalgar square.\n\nThe roundel was among the items given to the Museum by I. D. Adams, the daughter of  George Gammon Adams, in 1980. In total, 196 items were included in the Adams gift, which consisted of many models for medals as well as the busts and figurative sculpture. In most instances it is not possible to date conclusively the many models included in this gift.",
