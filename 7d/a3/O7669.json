Originally, a similarly shaped panel would have been accompanied it in a neighbouring window. The two panels together represent the theme of the \u2018Glorification of the Virgin in Heaven\u2019. The other one would have had an image of Christ Enthroned. \n\nDevotion to the Virgin Mary was widespread in Christian countries in the Middle Ages. However, the Bible records very little of her life. Most of the stories and the associated imagery about Mary that we find in churches and museums today come from accounts written centuries after her death. These stories were gathered together in the Golden Legend, a compilation of saints\u2019 lives written about 1260 by Jacobus de Voragine, who later became Archbishop of Genoa.  This had an enormous influence on church art.\n\nThe Golden Legend recounts an earlier story of the death of the Virgin and her Assumption into heaven. There she was greeted by a host of angels and by her son, Jesus Christ, who placed her on a throne next to his and put a crown on her head. In art, Christ is frequently depicted in the act of crowning his mother. In this panel that event has already occurred. Mary is now glorified as \u2018Queen of Heaven\u2019.",
