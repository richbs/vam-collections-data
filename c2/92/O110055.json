The acanthus ornament on the wood is similar to Italian-influenced designs by Johann Indau  (Romanische Ziehrathen, published  before1685) and Mathias Echter (Fogliami romani, published in1679) but it is also similar to the exuberantly carved furniture made in Venice at about this time by Andrea Brustolon (1662 - 1732). This chair once belonged to Charles Somers, 3rd Earl Somers, (1819 - 1883) of Eastnor Castle, Herefordshire. Somers was a great collector of Italian Art.",
