Millais used the ink to draw, in reverse, directly onto the wood block on a preparation of Chinese white. Afterwards, the Dalziels transferred photographically the image onto another block that they cut in the usual way.\nInitially, when the book was published in 1864, the caption was wrongly printed as The Parable of the Marriage Feast (from Luke\u2019s Gospel); it was corrected later as  Marriage of the King\u2019s son (from Matthew\u2019s Gospel).\nThe V&A bought the block directly from the Dalziel Brothers in July 1884.",
