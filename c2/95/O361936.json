On one side, for half the length, is painted in red and yellow with a fringed drape or ribbon which hangs suspended in eight drapes from seven bows of cord with hanging tassels. Suspended with the ribbon and just below it are strings of small green leaves. Above each drape is painted a small group of flowers. The other half is painted on the other side with one bow and tassel, with a half-drape to either side. One sequin is attached to the centre of the bow. Main decoration with a band of flowers and leaves on a larger scale than before, but juxtaposed to make continuous decoration.\n\nThe end of the sash is trimmed with gilt twisted threads with a row of small gold sequins above it. At the other end is a row of sequins outlining a rectangular tab through which the painting continues.",
