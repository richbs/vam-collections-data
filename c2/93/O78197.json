It suggests that the Queen did not pose for him. Instead he probably copied a drawing or print by another artist supplied to him by Compton Holland (active 1616, died 1622), the publisher of the print.\n\nMaterials & Making\nTo make this engraving,  Simon de Passe  would have used sharp pointed tools, called burins, to gouge the lines making up the picture, into a flat sheet of copper. The design would be in reverse. The engraver or another person called a printer would then have worked ink into these cut lines. The ink would then be  transferred onto a sheet of paper by bringing the copper plate and the paper into contact under pressure. Many identical examples of this engraving could have been produced by repeating this process. \n\nPeople\nThe engraver of this print, Simon de Passe, was from The Netherlands. As a young man he spent part of his working life in London. He was the son of another Netherlandish engraver, Crispijn de Passe the Elder (1564-1637). Crispijn de Passe the Elder worked in The Netherlands and Germany but had a number of business contacts in London, including Compton Holland, the publisher of  this print.",
