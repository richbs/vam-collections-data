Holmes (<i>Burlington Magazine</i>, Vol. XVII, 1910, p. 85) regards the picture in the National Gallery as the earliest, and as having been painted during Constable\u2019s honeymoon.  He identifies the Louvre picture as that exhibited at the British Institution in 1819, and dates No. 155 rather later than the National Gallery picture, suggesting that it is a sketch for the picture exhibited at the British Institution.  He therefore date in <i>c.</i>1819 (see Holmes, p. 244).  Davies (pp. 33 and 34) records the literature up to 1946, with reference to the National Gallery version.  Beckett (<i>Connoisseur</i>, Vol. CXXIX, 1952, pp. 6-8) considers that No. 155 is the original version, accepts the Louvre picture as that shown at the British Institution, and suggests that No. N.G. 2652 may be later.\nAs far as the date of No. 155 is concerned, it is almost certainly the open-air sketch from nature made by Constable on his honeymoon.  The other paintings would then be later versions based upon it.  This view, which is supported by the similarity in size to other oil sketches made by Constable on his honeymoon (Beckett, <i>loc. cit.</i>, p. 7), is virtually established by a point of detail.  In the National Gallery\u2019s picture and in the mezzotint of the subject by David Lucas a man is to be seen in the middle distance driving a flock of sheep, and perhaps representing distant water, mist or smoke.  It is probable that this shows what Constable had in front of him when he made the sketch on the beach, and that the decision to change it into the shepherd with his sheep was an afterthought, suggested by the rough, indefinite forms in the sketch.\nNo. 155 [330-1888] has long been considered as the work from which Lucas engraved the mezzotint \u2018Weymouth Bay, Dorsetshire\u2019 (S. 13) (<i>Inventory of Art Objects 1888</i> \u201cEngraved with variations in <i>English Landscape Scenery</i>\u201d; see also S.:L., p. 172).  However, as Davies, p. 34, points out, the pedigree of the Louvre picture shows that it is the one from which Lucas made the mezzotint, and No. 155 only enters into the matter as the source from which the Louvre picture as well as the other versions were painted (see also Beckett, <i>loc. cit.</i>, p. 7)\nTimothy Wilcox, <u>Constable and Salisbury.
