Vol. II. (London, 1922), fig. 216 'The early stools, from the mid-fifteenth to the early sixteenth century, are usually of one type, with solid ends, held together with deep framing-pieces halved into the trestles, and with tops pegged to the framing and supports. Fig. 216 from Barningham Hall is a long stool of this kind, dating from about 1450-60. The front \"apron\" is cut out in the form of eight ogival arches, the two in the centre, only, being cusped and this is original, no signs being visible of cuspings on the other archings. This form, which was discovered in the stables of the Hall, is very complete for its period. The present building only dates from 1612, but it was erected on the site of a much earlier house, to the furnishings of which this long stool probably belonged, or it may have formed a part of the possessions of Sir William Paston, who acquired the old manor house of the Winter family, on the site of which he erected his new hall. The date assigned to this piece, by the Museum Authorities, that of the late 14th or early fifteenth century, is somewhat early, as the form of the trestle ends is later than the pattern of the cusped arches, and it is the latest feature which establishes a period. The cusping also is more mannered that one would expect, at least in the late 14th century. It is safer, therefore, to ascribe a date towards the middle of the fifteeth century rather than its beginning. The back rail of this form, which is missing, but of which indications remain, was probably a plain board, as the cutting of the back of the trestle ends suggests that the piece was made to stand against a wall.\nLucretia Eddy Cotchett, The Evolution of Furniture (London, 1938), plate VI\nH.
