She became fascinated by people's obsessions with shoes, and the pain and expense they would go to to own them. 'Well-heeled' is a celebration of this obsession, acknowledging that shoes can be beautiful objects as well as recognising the sense of ridiculousness that surrounds the desire for luxury footwear.\n\nThe text, written by Julie O'Callaghan, narrates the thoughts of a designer shoe addict; finding the right shoes for the right occasion, choosing shoes to represent a state of mind, buying shoes as a form of therapy, wearing shoes to make a specific statement.\n\nThe book takes the form of six separate folded sheets, each one printed with a black and white lithograph depicting an exotic pair of shoes. These pages are wrapped in layers of pink and white tissue paper and housed in a white box with a hinged lid, similar to a shoe box. The act of lifting out each folded sheet from this packaging mimics that of lifting out pairs of shoes, causing the reader to take on the role of shoe obsessive.\n\n.",
