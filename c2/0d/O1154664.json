The fact that this stamp includes a royal crown together with references to currency indicates that it was added as a guarantee of the receipt's authenticity.\nThe receipt records the fee of forty-two pounds that Giulia Grisi received for her performance at the Concerts of Ancient Music.\nThese concerts were organised by a London concert society which existed between 1776 and 1848. It was founded by the Earl of Sandwich and others to preserve earlier music by presenting concerts of works more than 20 years old. Largely devoted to the works of Handel later concerts were criticized for lack of variety because newer works were not included as they became eligible.",
