There are three doors each side and 6 windows; all have been cut away.  However, though there are door handles the doors do not open.  The 1st class is the centre door.  The roof is convex and grey.  The base is black, mounted on two sets of two wheels.  At each end there is a coupling hook and buffers.\n2.  guard's van with duckets, matches the coaches and is in the same livery; roof is a different colour of grey possibly because of the rust.  The door each side is marked GUARD and has the window cut away.  Sides are also marked in red L&NWR, London and North Western Railway.\n*The coupling hooks are of a design used by Geb. Bing from 1913-1933.\n*Because of the use of gold paint not merely yellow as used on objects, B.136:1-3-1997, these two are likely to be earlier than the others, possibly even pre-1914.",
