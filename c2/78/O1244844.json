It is lined with blue silk taffeta. It is of simple kimono-like construction with no fastenings. There are no shoulder seams, so the design of the silk is in the correct orientation at the back, but appears upside down as it comes over the shoulders and down the front.\n\nThe loom width of the damask is 71 cm (28 inches). This width is consistent with it having been woven on a Chinese rather than European loom, as the design suggests.",

Robes like this became popular in Europe from the mid-17th  century, brought back by members of the East India Company, and by the 1670s  European tailors were making banyans, also known as nightgowns. During the  18th century nightgowns evolved into several different shapes, from the simple T- shape of the original kimono to others cut more like the European coat. Their generically 'oriental' air was part of a wider taste for exotic designs that formed  part of the fashion for Chinoiserie.\n\nThis banyan is a striking and rare example, in very good condition for its age, made  from blue silk damask woven in China for import into Europe. Such silks were  primarily intended for furnishing, and appear in merchants' records as 'bed  damasks'; the length of their pattern repeat was displayed to best advantage in  the long drop of bed curtains. A silk damask of closely similar design to this was used to furnish a room in the summer palace of  Prince Eugene of Savoy, Schlosshof, in 1725 (now in MAK in Vienna).",
