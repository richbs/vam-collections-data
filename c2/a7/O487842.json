            "physical_description": "A ten-sided box of brown lacquer, raised on a vertical foot. The flat top is inlaid with mother-of-pearl and painted in green, brown, gold and touches of red and black with a design of prunus in flower and bamboo. All the prunus flowers and buds are executed in mother-of-pearl, as are some of the bamboo leaves, the rest being painted. The painted branches and leaves are outlined in gold. The top is bordered by single twisted wire. Each side of base and lid carries a panel of fine basketry. The edges of both halves and the foot are painted in gold with a 'hui wen' key-pattern.\nPROVENANCE: Collection of Sir John and Lady Figgess. Lot 3 in ''Important Chinese Lacquer'', Ceramics and Works of Art (Christie's London,  14th-16th December 1983)\nCOMPARE: Sir Harry Garner, ''A Group of Chinese Lacquers with Basketry Panels'', Archives of Asian Art XX 1966-1967, pp. 6-24, p.16 for a box in the H.M. Knight Collection, Holland which exhibits very similar panels of basketry within rectangular, turned-in-corner cartouches. However the present example is not strictly comparable with any of the more familiar dated types of lacquer with basketry, and a wide dating is therefore necessary. \nBOX: The accompanying Japaness wood box carries in addition to the Christie's label several fragmentary handwritten labels in Japanese.(cc 19/7/1984)\nOpinion of James Watt, Metropolitan Museum 6/8/90 The object is Ryukynan.",
