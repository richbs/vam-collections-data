The body, although not hallmarked, can be dated by its style to about 1680.  However, the mounts predate the body by more than a century.  It is likely that the mounts were originally made for a glass vessel which was accidentally broken and replaced by a silver body in the same shape, decorated in the 17th century fashion.  \n\nThis piece is an example of 16th century domestic silver. Such silver was both functional and ornamental. Objects for dining and drinking took elegant forms and were decorated in the latest styles. Beautifully crafted items intended only for display often adopted functional forms such as cups and dishes. Domestic silver was not confined to the most wealthy. Many people owned silver spoons or mounted vessels, items which often became treasured possessions.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",

The body, although not hallmarked, almost certainly dates from about 1680-85, since virtually all hallmarked plate decorated in this style is of that period. The most likely conjecture is that the original body, possibly of glass, was accidentally broken around that time and replaced by a silver body that reproduced the form of the original vessel while being decorated in the current fashion (...see: cat. no. 31). Antiquarian interest in plate rarely existed before the nineteenth century, so it was more probable that the mounts were preserved because the pot was a family heirloom...(Schroder, 1988, pp. 40, 43).",
