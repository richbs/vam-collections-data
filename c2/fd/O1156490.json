            "public_access_description": "Bound sheet music for The Detective's Song written by W.S.Gilbert and composed by T.German Reed.\n\nThe front sheet of this music has a central illustration showing a male performer dressed in an outfit which mimicks that of the stereotypical Native American Indian. He wears a thick fur coat, a feather trimmed headress, tight leather trousers and a loose tunic, belted at the waist. He is standing with one knee bent, pointing in to the distance.This illustration is captioned with the phrase 'sung with the greatest success by Mr. Corney Grain'.\n\nIt featured in Mr. & Mrs. German Reed's 'new and successful entertainment' A Sensation Novel and was published by Hopwood&Crew, London.\n\nThis piece featured as part of 'The German Reed Entertainment' which was founded in 1855 and operated by Thomas German Reed (1817\u20131888) together with his wife, Priscilla Reed n\u00e9e Horton (1818\u20131895). At the time that these entertainments were first proposed the theatre in London was seen by many as a disreputable place and the German Reed family sought to provide a more respectable form of entertainment. \n\nThe entertainments were held at the intimate Royal Gallery of Illustration, Lower Regent Street, and later at St. George's Hall, Langham Place, in London. Thomas and Priscilla German Reed usually appeared in them, together with a small group of players. They engaged talented newcomers, such as Frederic Clay, W. S. Gilbert and Arthur Law, as well as established writers like F. C. Burnand, to create many of the entertainments. Thomas German Reed composed the music for many of the entertainments himself.",
