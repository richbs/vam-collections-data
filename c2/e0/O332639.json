Oval dish with flat rim and vertical sides. The rim is moulded with two arabesques patterns alternating, one coloured yellow, one green. In the middle of the dish, in the foreground to the right, Jupiter disguised as Diana is ssen approaching Callisto who is seated naked on the bank of a river. To their left, in the middle of the foreground, Pluto is seizing Proserpine  who is kneeling on one knee, her lap full of flowers. A line of trees crosses the dish diagonally; above this line, on the right among rocks and trees is a city and Pluto with Proserpine driving in a chariot; from above Cupid is shooting an arrow; and on a mound seemingly suspended in mid-air, Venus is seen embracing Cupid; at the top of the composition sun rays are breaking through a dark cloud. The back of the dish and the inner sides are covered with a dappled  marble pattern.",
