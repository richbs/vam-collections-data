I, p. 141, cat.295\nThe following is the full text of the catalogue entry:\n\n'288/307 \nDesigns (29 on 20 sheets) for goldsmith's work \nPen and ink and wash \nSize of largest sheet 211/2x 153/4 (547 x 400); of smallest sheet 151/2 x 103/4 (394 x 273) \n5160 to 5176, 5229, 5230, 5398 \nPROVENANCE Bought from T. M. Whitehead \n1867 \nLITERATURE J. F. Hayward, 'The Mannerist goldsmiths', part I (Italian sources), and \npart 3 (Italian influence in the designs of Erasmus Hornick), in The Connoisseur, 149, 1962, pp. 157-64 and 158, 1965, pp. 144- 49 (with illustration of no. 5168) \n\nThe drawings, when bought in 1867, were bound in a vellum-covered album containing 276 sheets of designs for goldsmiths' work, from which they were subsequently removed. The title-page is dated 1560 and states that the drawings illustrate the treasury of the Emperor Rudolf 11. This statement is incorrect and was not made, presumably, by the artist or the original owner; but the date may be correct and show when the album was formed. Most of the drawings are of northern origin, and many of them have been attributed by Hayward to the Antwerp goldsmith Erasmus Hornick. Of some of the drawings it is difficult to say whether they were made north or south of the Alps, but the twenty sheets listed below form a fairly homogeneous group that may be attributed to an Italian artist. Hayward has pointed out that thirteen of these Italian drawings are replicas of drawings in the possession of Dr Pirman at Stockholm: there are other replicas in other collections, mostly single sheets. Hayward considers that the existence of such replicas proves that there was a trade in the sale of such drawings as patterns for goldsmiths in Italy and elsewhere. The drawings show many characteristics of Salviati's taste in ornament, but they look like copies. More information on the Hornick album and an account of other similar collections of drawings are given in three articles by J. F. Hayward in The Burlington Magazine, IIO, 1968, pp. 200-06 and pp. 383-89; II4, 1972, pp. 378-86. \nOur drawings show the following utensils: \n\n293/297 \nDesigns (5) for dishes \nNos. 293 and 294 not illustrated \n5169-5173'\n\nPeter Ward Jackson, 1979",
