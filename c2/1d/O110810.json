It includes a programme for the funeral procession along with an image of the Queen and lists those present at the ceremony. Like other ephemera produced for her funeral the napkin is bordered in black, but Queen Victoria reportedly disliked the use of the colour black for funerals and the banners decorating the streets were consequently purple and white.\n\nEphemera produced for Queen Victoria\u2019s funeral was prolific and various, facilitated by new printing technology which allowed its mass-production in different forms. It also reflects the very public nature of mourning at this time; Victoria had been in perpetual mourning since the death of Prince Albert in 1861.",
