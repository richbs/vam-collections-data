It consisted of an iron rod fitted with circular brass discs at either end, which operated vertically within the hollow candle stem.  By pushing up the button in the base, the stub was ejected at the top.\n\nManufacturing Process\nIn the 18th century and before, brass candlesticks were usually made from castings produced in a two-piece mould.  The various elements, such as the base and column, were then soldered or 'brazed' together.  By the early 19th century, columns were often made from extruded brass tubing.  This allowed candlesticks to be made of thin gauge metal, and, as a consequence, they were much cheaper, since they required far less brass than the old cast versions.",
