It shows a full length image of a young woman dressed in a floor length white gown. The skirt of the dress is made up of layers of white fabric, the top skirt is tinted pale blue and ends in a soft 'V' slightly below hip level. The base of the under skirt has a scalloped hem and is decorated with silver motifs of ribbons and flowers. The sleeveless empire line bodice has two translucent lengths of white and silver fabric hanging from either shoulder hanging behind her arms and ending in a heavy silver tassel at the base of the upper skirt. Her bodice is also decorated with a spray of purple flowers (pinned just next to her right shoulder) and has a plain central panel. Either side of this are the panels of what resembles a waistcoat, these are decorated with silver motifs at the centre edge and extend beyond the base of the bodice to hang over the upper skirt. She also wears white, elbow length gloves and a tight fitting white turban with a spray of upright feathers[?] at the centre front and a row of silver beads at the front edge. There is an additional pencil sketch showing a detail of the beading and pleating at the hem of the top skirt.\n[costume design] A sketch labelled 'detail a' showing further detail of the decoration on the skirt of the dress. The sketch is annotated with directions about the construction and inspiration for the design.",

            "public_access_description": "Design in watercolour on paper for an unidentified female figure, possibly a member of the chorus and probably created by Comelli for a production of Gipsy Love at Daly's Theatre in 1912. This design is accompanied by a further annotated sketch labelled 'detail a' showing a detail of the decoration and shaping of the skirt.\n\nComelli (1858-1925) was the house designer of the Royal Opera House from the late 1880s to the early 1920s. During this period he also worked for the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and also designed costumes from a number of Gilbert&Sullivan productions.\n\nThe Gipsy Girl, or Zigeunerliebe in the original German, is an operetta by Franz Leh\u00e1r. The English lyrics for this production at Daly's Theatre, London were written by Basil Hood and Adrian Ross.\n\nThe story follows Ilona who is engaged to Jonel. After meeting Jozsi, a gipsy violinist, Ilona doubts her feelings towards Jonel and wonders if she would be happier with Jozsi. Ilona dreams of a life with Jozsi but realises she would not be happy. On awakening she devotes herself to Jonel.\n\nZigeunerliebe premiered at the Carltheatre in Vienna in 1910. The production that these costume designs are from opened at Daly's Theatre on 1st June 1912.\n\nThis design come from a collection of items given to the Museum by the Emile Littler Estate. Emile Littler (1903-1985) was a manager and producer, whose early career embraced both general theatrical management and stage management before he started in management on his own in 1934. He was married to the actress and Principal boy Cora Goffin whose success was such that her legs were insured for \u00a320,000. She continued to tour the provinces and Ireland in her husband's productions until her retirement from the stage in 1940.  By the 1950s Littler was presenting plays, musicals and pantomimes and during his lifetime he wrote and directed over fifteen productions at various London theatres and over 200 throughout Britain. In 1974 he received a Knighthood and was made a freeman of the city of London. He died 11 years later in January 1985.",
