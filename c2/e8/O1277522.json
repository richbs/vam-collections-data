            "public_access_description": "Fred Tickner (1898-1992) was a Punch and Judy professor and one of the great makers of Punch and Judy figures whose style influenced many later makers. Although his style could always be recognised, each Punch he made was entirely individual. Tickner gave the first performance of Punch and Judy on television in the 1930s, and also made the original Muffin the Mule for BBC television.\n\nBruce Macloud was a well known Scottish Punch professor, known as 'Uncle Mac', who carved his puppets from oak and toured widely with his show 'from Bournemouth to Burma'. He appeared on television with his Punch and Judy in the 1930s, and in the 1940s took part in the radio programme In Town Tonight, after which he was depicted on one of the Churchman's series of cigarette cards In Town Tonight.\n\nThis photograph was taken outside the Leicester Square branch of the tobacconist's Angel Botibol &amp; Company that had several branches around London in the 1930s. The sign to the Post Office at 39 Charing Cross Road also pinpoints the location. The British Puppet and Model Theatre Guild held its annual exhibitions for several years at Victory House in Leicester Square, and the label on the back shows that this was taken as a publicity photograph for one of their exhibitions, possibly that held from 24-30 October 1938.",
