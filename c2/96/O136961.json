The shape of the blade is in the form of the eighteenth century Dutch server, given a contemporary twist by the two positive cusps on either side that subtly echo the tessellated pattern of the handle. The symmetry of the large, pierced double-foliate junction that joins the blade and handle offers an easy grace. The handle consists of pressed disks in a honeycomb tessellated structure enhanced with a honey-coloured gild. The decorative texture of this effect on the handle complements the simpler design of the blade while the negative space suggested by the tessellated pattern and the pierced blade links the two portions. The gilt of the handle and the bezel at its end embedded with a citrine stone create a sense of natural splendour.",
