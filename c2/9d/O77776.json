This kind is sometimes known as an \u00e9tui-n\u00e9cessaire because it contained the essentials for the sewing or dressing table.  It was probably intended to be hung from a girdle.\n\nPeople\nAccording to the inscription, the \u00e9tui was a gift from Queen Anne (ruled 1702-1714) to Abigail Masham (died 1734), who, as Abigail Hill, was appointed as a personal maid to the queen about 1700.  She was credited with considerable influence over the Queen, much to the annoyance of her cousin, Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough (1660-1744), who had been her early patron.  In 1707 she married Samuel Masham, and in 1711 she was given control of the privy purse.  Her husband was created a Baron in 1712.  She retired from Court on Queen Anne's death in 1714.\n\nAuthenticity\nThe \u00e9tui has survived some close scrutiny in the past, but it can be difficult to judge the date of hardstone objects with relatively little mounting.  The flowers chased on the fruit-knife handle look mid-18th century.  The knife could be a replacement, but it is possible that the whole \u00e9tui is also mid-18th century.",
