From the late 1500s onwards, Japanese men wore the inro suspended from their sash by a silk cord and a netsuke (toggle). They originally used it to hold their seal and ink or a supply of medicines. However, it rapidly became a costly fashion accessory of little or no practical use. Most inro are rectangular with gently curving sides. \nLacquer was most commonly used in the manufacture of inro since it was highly suitable for storing medicines. Lacquer is the sap from the tree Rhus verniciflua that grows mainly in East Asia. After processing, it is applied in many thin layers to a base material.  The craft of lacquering, as well as making inro bodies, is highly complex, time-consuming and expensive.  \nThis example is one of a group of relatively early inro, which makes characteristic and distinctive use of carved tortoiseshell. This is usually combined with a fern scroll in gold on black or brown lacquer. The carved tortoiseshell is also laid over pieces of gold foil that highlight certain parts of the design.",
