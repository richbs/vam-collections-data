The Museum had bought the Castellani Collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the same exhibition, and chose this Danish brooch, among others, to show the differences and similarities between traditional jewellery from different countries.  The main purpose of all these acquisitions was to help improve the quality of design among British artisans.\n\nIn the 1860s, silversmiths throughout Scandinavia had started to experiment with using traditional techniques and patterns, particularly in filigree, to make fashionable jewellery, and this brooch is an example of that trend.  It is not a traditional Danish design.  There was very little women\u2019s traditional jewellery still being worn in Denmark at that date, and nothing resembling this brooch.  It is probably based on the style developed in Norway by Jacob Tostrup, among others, who also exhibited in Paris in 1867.\n\nIt cost eight shillings and ten pence in Paris in 1867.",
