It was conceived as part of the furnishings of a drawing room en suite with a sofa and chairs (one of which, W.24-1982, is in the V&A's collection).\n\nThe outline of the fall-front desk is similar to that of a late 18th-century secretaire \u00e1 abattant but the showcase on top is a novel feature. The elongated oval and diamond shapes of the showcase make a bold decorative statement and are repeated on the sofa and chairs. It appears Moser used both historical and modern motifs: a sofa of about 1820 in Regensburg Museum, Germany, has similar geometric ornament in its back and sides.",
