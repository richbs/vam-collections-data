The range contained several different rattles and Page held patents on various innovations. The range was promoted as \u2018sensible\u2019 for its use of washable plastics and non-rusting silver plated metal parts. \n\nThe Kiddicraft catalogue describes this product as:\n'Light in weight, and with a most satisfying jingle, this is a safe rattle for Baby's early days. It has been designed especially for easy cleaning and, therefore, complete hygiene. The discs are smooth to suck and to bite on, with fast colours. The silver-plated chain cannot rust. Each link is individually welded. A 'sensible' nursery article by Kiddicraft'",
