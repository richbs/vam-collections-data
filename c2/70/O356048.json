The first model was produced in France by Antoine Gibus, from whom the style took its name, though they were also known as 'opera hats', due to their provision of convenience and requisite style when attending cultural events, and also as 'chapeau claques', after the clicking sound made by one when opened.\n\nThe top hat was the head-covering of choice for nineteenth-century gentlemen, and for those who wished to look like gentlemen, and maintaining an image of urbanity and authority was of great importance at all times.\n\nThis example's modest proportions are very typical of the very end of the nineteenth-century, when the top hat, going the same way as the powdered wig as a superfluous symbol of a parasitic aristocracy, was finally beginning to go out of fashion.",
