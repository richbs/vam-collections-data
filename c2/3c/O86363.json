Here the main design in blue-and-white is painted on the fritware body under the glaze. It shows five ducks sitting on a mound beside a large lake, in which there are three islands. It is surrounded by a plain band moulded with a design of lotus flowers and leaves.\n\nChinese blue-and \u2013white porcelain had been popular in Iran since the 14th century,  and  Iranian potters began making imitations soon after. Production rose sharply in the the 17th century, perhaps because the Chinese wares were temporarily  unavailable.\n\nFritware, also called stone paste and quartz paste, was developed by Middle Eastern potters as a response to the challenge posed by Chinese porcelain. Unlike high-fired Chinese porcelain, low-fired fritware was soft and porous, but like porcelain it was white all the way through and could be used to make convincing substitutes.",
