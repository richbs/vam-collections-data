Karsavina later danced Jumping Joan as an independent solo, for example at the Winter Gardens, Bournemouth, on 20 July 1922.\n\nThe short ballet was described in the review 'Nursery Rhymes in Ballet. Mme Karsavina at the Coliseum', The Times, 4 January 1921, p.8: \u2018Mme. Karsavina then came in a Jumping Joan \u2013 not the Jumping Joan who used to appear in rather a smudged condition in the woodcuts of the old chapbooks, but a Jumping Joan who spent her life jumping as though it really appealed to her. Her manner of conveying to the audience the surprising fact that \u2018When nobody is with me I am always alone\u2019 was inimitable. The costumes for the various nursery rhymes were presented against \u2018a plain scene in bright reds, greens and yellows, with a grotesque door with pillars if brilliant yellow\u2019 and the acts were introduced by, two flunkeys, who act as scene shifters and interpreters alternately in a most engaging terpsichorean way\u2019.\n\nCorrespondence between the design Claud Lovat Fraser and Karsavina suggests that this ballet did not really appeal to the Coliseum\u2019s manager, Alfred Stoll.\n\nThis design was a presentation design, given by Fraser to Edwin Evans, the music advisor, and signed and dated January 1921. A photograph of an earlier version of this design (signed and dated December 1920) is held in the Claud Lovat Fraser biographical file in the V&amp;A Theatre and Performance department.",
