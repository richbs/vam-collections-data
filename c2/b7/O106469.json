Most of the chair covers in the V&A date to the Qing Dynasty (1644\u20131911) or later.  \n\nThis dark blue satin chair cover dates to the 18th century. The top part would drape over the back rail of a chair, and the longevity (\u2018shou\u2019) character would then appear the right way up. The portion showing vessels and the vase would cover the inside back of the chair, where the portion with plants, outlined with gold, rests on the seat. The bottom portion with the mythical qilin falls down the front to the floor.\n\nSuch covers were used on wooden chairs with or without arms. It is possible that these furnishings performed a decorative function and were never sat on, and they were probably laid out according to the season, or when guests were expected.",
