It was Stravinsky's second ballet for Diaghilev's Ballets Russes and used a story of traditional street puppets, the Russian equivalent of Punch and Judy, who are brought to life by a showman. The first performance was given at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet, Paris, in 1911. \n\nPetrushka was designer Alexandre Benois' most important production. The ballet was frequently revived and between 1911 and 1957 Benois redrew the sets and costumes for 14 different productions. As his designs are similar in style they can be difficult to date, especially as Benois would annotate later designs with the names of the dancers who created the roles and would sometimes date them to 1911.  The majority of his original drawings were annotated and signed in Russian, as is this one, so it seems likely that this design is for the first production of the ballet.",
