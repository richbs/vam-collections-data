His charismatic personality and leadership made him a focus of the country's hopes for a democratic future and his image inspired widespread loyalty. He was selected as president of Czechoslovakia by parliament in December 1989 and was re-elected as president by the Federal Assembly after the free elections in June 1990. This photograph by Milo\u0161 Fikejz portrays Havel as a bohemian, a world-worn but visionary dissident. His image evolves in later posters which present him in a suit with the body language of a statesman.\n\nIn the text on this poster he claims to be politically independent of any particular ideology and to act solely according to the moral dictates of his own conscience.\n\n\nDesigned, printed and published in former Czechoslovakia",
