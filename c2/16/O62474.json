This linen curtain was worked by Ann Macbeth in about 1900. It is decorated at the lower end with a design of stylised leaves and flowers created with appliqu\u00e9 linen shapes, decorated with mauve glass beads. The outlines of the leaves and flowers, and the square shapes in the design, are worked in cream silk in satin stitch.The curtain is bordered on three sides with green linen embellished with blue glass beads.\n\nAnn Macbeth (1875-1948) enrolled as a student in the Embroidery and Needlework Department at the Glasgow School of Art in 1897. Following the retirement of Jessie Newbery, for whom she had acted as Assistant Instructress since 1901, she became Head of the department in 1908. She was a talented embroiderer but her importance, and international recognition, lie in her contribution to needlework education, particularly for children. The system she developed was devised to build a child's skills gradually and teach hand and eye coordination without stifling imagination and enthusiasm.",
