No. 88 [Presumably acquired from Cooper's estate by the Rosses, or perhaps by Priestman (see Rosse, Cat.  No. 143) and perhaps in the Michael Rosse sale, 2 April 1723; eventually purchased by Edwin [Durning] Lawrence  before 1862, and sold by him to the Museum for \u00a3525 in 1892].\n\n<b>Exhibited:</b> As for Cat.

I, p. 53 (tentatively attributing the set to Flatman); Foster 1908, p. 184 (as attributed to Cooper, but  Foster would give some to Dixon; he now states that some give the poorer ones to Flatman); Catalogue of  Miniatures , 1908, pp. 9-10 (as formerly attributed to Cooper); Goulding 1914-15, p. 49 (as Rosse); Long 1929, p. 377 (Rosse); Long 1930, pp. 65-6 (as by Rosse); Reynolds 1952, pp. 81-2 (Rosse); Foskett 1963, pp. 77-8; Foskett  1972, vol I, p. 481 (Rosse); Foskett 1974, p. 91 (Rosse); Reynolds 1975, specifically p. 9, no. 1, pl. 13; Foskett  1979, pp. 125-6 (following Reynolds 1975); Summary Catalogue , 1981, p. 9 (Cooper); V J Murrell, 'The Craft of the  Miniaturist' , Murdoch 1981, p. 12, fig. 14 (as Cooper); V J Murrell, 'Technique and Practice', Strong 1983, p. 28, no.  1; Reynolds 1988, p. 78 and specifically pp. 59 and 78]; and by itself Reynolds 1975, p. 12, no. 4, pl. I7; <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 9. \n\nThe sitter is unknown, and it may be merely fanciful to see a family resemblance to the women of the Cooper-Hoskins connection. But could this be the widow of the elder Hoskins (d.1664/ 5)? She died on February 1668/9. Otherwise, there was <i>'A Widow's Head,</i> by Cooper' offered as lot 427 on the seventh day of the Michael Rosse sale in April 1723.
