The robe or sanghati covers both shoulders and clings tightly to the flesh, hanging cloak-like at the sides in stylised  folds characteristic of the North Indian (Pala) school. The usnisa is composed of a northern-style proturberance superimposed by the southern-style flame. The urna is a southern type, resembling an inverted question mark. The hands have conventional palm-marks on a circular lotus-pedestal with holes for securing the image while being carried in procession.\nThis sculpture is one of the finest Buddhist bronzes to survive from South India. Buddhism came early to Southern India, as recorded by the 3rd century BC inscriptions of the Emperor Asoka. The region continued to be a centre of Buddhist learning as late as the 12th century, despite the growing dominance of Hinduism. Cities such as Nagapattinam attracted royal endowments not only from the local Chola dynasty but also from overseas kingdoms, such as the Sailendra rulers of Java. Buddhist scholars were widely attracted and generous patronage provided for the creation of numerous Buddha images.",

The Buddha stands on a circular double-lotus pedestal, with holes for securing the image during processional use.\n\nHe gazes outward at the viewer, with his right hand gesturing protection (\u2018abhaya-mudra\u2019). His monastic robe (\u2018sanghati\u2019) covers both shoulders. It clings tightly to his body and forms stylised folds at the hem, in a manner characteristic of the eastern Indian Pala style. \n\nThe figure displays a number of the auspicious marks (\u2018laksanas\u2019) denoting Buddha-hood. These include the skull protruberance (\u2018usnisa\u2019) which has a flame projection - a southern-style motif. The forehead mark (\u2018urna\u2019) is of the southern \u2018hair-curl\u2019 type, resembling an inverted question mark, and the hands have conventional palm markings.\n \nThis figure is in the style closely associated with the port city of Nagapattinam, coastal Tamilnadu. The Buddhist monastic complex there was the largest in medieval south India. It received generous patronage, as witnessed by over 350 bronze images that have been excavated or found by chance in the vicinity of the vihara and surrounding region.",
