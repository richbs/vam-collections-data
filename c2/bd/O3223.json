It took only two men to shape a measured quantity of hot glass in a heated metal mould. They simply depressed a lever that lowered a metal plunger into the glass, forcing it into the patterned mould. By the 1830s this method had spread to Britain and continental Europe, giving rise to stylistic changes in glass and revolutionising the availability of glassware. The technique made the mid-to-late 19th century the first real period of true mass production. In the 1890s the introduction of steam-powered presses improved the product while cutting costs even further.\n\nColours\nIn 1889 George Davidson patented a new production method for two new colours of glass under the names of 'Primrose Pearline' and 'Blue Pearline'. The novelty of this extremely popular 'Pearline' glass was that the colour of each piece varies from clear at the bottom to opaque at the top.\n\nPeople\nThis flower trough was made by George Davidson & Co., Teams Glass Works, at Gateshead-on-Tyne, Tyne and Wear. Founded in 1867, they soon became one of the most famous and prolific manufacturers of press-moulded glass in Britain.",
