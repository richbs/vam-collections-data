Her face is delicately modelled and her features are emphasised with a dark line along her facial profile.  She is richly bejewelled and has red tips to her fingers and her heels. She is wearing a transparent white <i>peshwaz</i>overdress with narrow gold stripes open down the centre which reveals her golden <i>paijama</i> decorated with a pattern of crimson flowers and long gold <i>patka</i> with its row of bright red tulip-like flowers. On her feet she wears a pair of burgundy-coloured slippers which are also decorated with a gold pattern.  She has her arms folded across her body beneath her breasts which are visible through her transparent costume her head and upper body she has a transparent <i>odhani</i> (veil) which is decorated with circles of gold spots.  It is edged in gold and the ends are decorated with bands of green and purple stripes with golden streaks. \n  She is shown between two poppy-like plants which stand out against a turquoise green background that rises up to the top of the painting where an illusory sky is suggested by streaks of purple and gold which give way to a darker purple area picked out in fine gold squiggles to denote clouds.\n  The painting  is framed in a pale brown inner border with a scrolling floral and foliated pattern in gold.  This is outlined in white with bands of gold and further outlines in black and blue.  The painting is mounted on an ivory-coloured border with a design of alternate pink lilies and red poppies outlined in gold.  The page has strips of buff-coloured paper with an inner outline in white at its margins. A pale brown strip of paper has been added to act as a gutter for the album binding.",
