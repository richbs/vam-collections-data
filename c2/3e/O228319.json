He has designed settings and costumes for the major British ballet, opera and theatre companies and is particularly noted for his work at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden; the Old Vic and Glyndebourne.  He frequently worked with director William Chappell and in 1966 they collaborated on the premiere of Malcolm Williamson's opera, The Violins of Saint-Jacques, for which Chappell also wrote the libretto.\n \nAdapted from the novel by Patrick Leigh Fermor, itself inspired by historical events, the opera takes place on a Caribbean island in 1902. Its story of tangled love affairs amongst a community of French aristocrats is set against a background of voodoo, and ends with a volcanic eruption which destroys the island. Rice's designs for the costumes are good examples of his detailed naturalistic style. Much of the action takes place at a Marde Gras ball. This design is for a guest, danced by Ann Harrison.",
