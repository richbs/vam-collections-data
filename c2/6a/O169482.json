On the lower part of each section and delineating the outline are composite tows [lozenges and V-shapes and dots] of embroidery with white silk in chain stitch and French knots which look like rows of pearls. [When 'pearls' were depicted on Resht work they were done with spiralling chain/tambour stitch]. There are two of these rows near the cap rim.  Each section is trimmed along the seams and base with a narrow braid of silver metal thread and a strip of gilded copper.\nWoollen Yarn: Z2S\nLining: a closely woven plain weave white cotton, perhaps originally glazed, printed with an offset pattern of multi-coloured floral botehs predominantly in blue, black, red, pink and yellow details.\nFacing: pieced; bias-cut patterned wool [twill tapestry?] with alternate toothed stripes of red or white containing an angular meander in blue with yellow and black details, or green with red and yellow details.\nEmbroidery Thread: white silk; 2S.\nMetal Thread: [1] silver strip open S-wound on a yellow silk core. [2] copper gilt strip.",
