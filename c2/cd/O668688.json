The 'book' had no text and seems to have been intended as an advertisement for the potential applications of nature printing. It was quickly followed by Moore's 'Ferns of Great Britain and Ireland' (1855), and Johnstone and Croall's 'Nature-Printed British Sea-weeds (1859).\n\nAlthough modelled on the actual plant, nature prints lack the illusion of three dimensions conveyed by a conventional illustration, and in fact resemble flattened herbarium specimens.",
