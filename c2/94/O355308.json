Stitching pattern and cord remain from waist to seat (rough V connected to a teardrop).  Upper: Leather layer with extra padding at waist and seat. Skinny waist of 17mm with circular seat of 40 mm, sewn with running stitch. Padding ends at top of waist. Vamp mostly covered (except at instep) with punched waffle-hatching. At instep, high throat, there are five incised lines, either side, of a wide V shape, cutting across half the vamp and crossing at the centre. The bottom line, either side, is longer. The lines appear slightly overcut in the middle. Instep is cut straight across with a central oval knop. Mid-vamp is an applied, square medallion of gilded layer of openworked leather. Outer square contains a diamond and the inner has floral shapes. Inner shape is a short-cross with cross arms teardrop shaped. The quarters are 3mm thick and cut wide down to the heel where they end as an open heel. There are two, thick leather threads either side, holding the quarter to the treadsole.\n[Slipper] A flat slipper of red leather. Dirty and faded. Sole: Scraped at forepart. Complete break at waist. Blackened at seat and warped. Upper: Leather blackened at seat.\n[Slipper] A flat slipper of red leather. Dirty and faded. Sole: White spotted residue on tread. Two modern labels. Upper: Leather blackened at seat. Medallion is dirty. The vamp was stuffed with navy blue wad of thread (cotton?) and a wad of tabby, plaid linen. The linen is undyed with bright green stripes - one thick stripe with two smaller stripes crossing over in the other direction. Unsure of the direction of warp or weft. The large stripe has a count of 8tpc/9tpc. A piece of natural linen has 9tpc/7tpc. One green thread has a diameter of 0.5mm while the natural threads differ in thickness. One at 1mm and another at 2mm.",

Made using the turned technique with rand. Acquired from D.B.Myers.\n\nCoptic footwear was generally made of leather, primarily using the turned technique to produce a slipper or shoe with a straight sole. Slippers often included a rand at the vamp and a fibre padded sole sewn together with prominent stitching or insole tab. They show variation in the form and height of the instep. Shoes were generally slip-ons and also show variation in the form and height of the instep. Footwear was highly decorated in geometric and floral designs. Often a variety of techniques were used in combination with the most popular being dyeing, gilding, openwork and appliqu\u00e9.",
