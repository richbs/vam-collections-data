Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hard-wearing. Above all, they had to have the means for attaching a cord. Netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated being the katabori (shape carving), a three-dimensional carving. This one is in the form of a sennin (Daoist immortal) holding a peach branch with two fruits each containing another immortal.\n\nImmortals or tanscendents were practioners of religious Daoism, a school of Chinese thought with its origins in the fifth to third centuries BCE, which was subsequently transformed into an organized religion with a reconized pantheon of deities. Immortals were perfected beings who, through self-cultivation, were able to transcend their normal existence and take leave of their bodies.",
