After James Gillray\u2019s death 1815, he became the leading political caricaturist of the day. In the 1820s he turned to book illustration, receiving many commissions to provide plates for novels; the success of Dickens's <i>Sketches</i> by Box (1830) was largely due to Cruikshank's designs. In the 1840s his success and reputation declined, especially with the advent of <i>Punch</i> (1841). Many of his later works are concerned with the cause of temperance, and he enjoyed considerable success with his series of prints 'The Bottle' (1847). A prolific maker of prints during a long working life (there is an extensive collection in the V&A), the number of works in oil is small; he exhibited eight at the RA between 1830 and 1867 and 15 at the BI 1833-60, the subjects principally literary and genre. Died London 1 February 1878; a good deal of his studio collection was presented to the V &A by his second wife Eliza. \n\nLIT: G Reid <i>A Descriptive Catalogue of the Works of George Cruikshank</i>  3 vols, 1871; W Bates <i>George Cruikshank</i> 1878; B Jerrold <i>The Life of George Cruikshank</i> new ed 1898; A Cohn <i>George Cruikshank: a Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9</i> 1924; <i>The Inimitable George Cruikshank</i> University of Louisville Libraries, Kentucky, USA, exhibition catalogue 1968; W Feaver <i>George Cruikshank</i> V&A exhibition catalogue 1974; H and M Evans <i>The Man Who Drew the Drunkard's Daughter </i>... 1978; M Wynn <i>George Cruikshank: His Life and London</i>1978; G Buchanan-Brown <i>The Book Illustrations of George Cruikshank</i> Newton Abbot 1980 \n\n<b>Venus Rising from the Froth of the Sea</b> \nAL9570 \nCanvas, painted surface has an arched top, 30.5 x 25.1 cm (12 x 9 7/8 ins) \nSigned 'George Cruikshank' br and inscribed on the back as below \nGiven by Mrs George Cruikshank 1884\n \nThe title is that given on a label on the back, written in both pen and pencil, presumably by the artist's wife, and pasted on to the upper stretcher: 'Venus rising from the Froth of the Sea/By George Cruikshank and Signed'. \n\nEXH: <i>George Cruikshank</i> V&A 1974 (383)\"",
