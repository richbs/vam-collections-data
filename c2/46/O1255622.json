Each contains a variety of news and reports about activities in the school, the projects pupils are working on, cartoons and drawings, and contributions from staff and pupils. There are also references to national events, such as the War and Armistice, and how these impact on school life. The Headteacher and editor, Adrian Percy Bishop, signs his editorials 'The Old Fag' and many of the hand-coloured illustrations are signed A.P.B.

Bishop threw himself into his new role, introducing new ideas such as a prefect system and poultry farming. The magazines chart the next twelve years of the school\u2019s history, reporting on the challenges and triumphs of this small village school.\nThe magazines offer a rich trove of stories and pictures of sporting events, performances and parades, scholarships, class work and singular events.\nBishop oversaw the production of a wooden War Memorial in 1919, a whole-school visit to the Empire Exhibition at Wembley in 1924, the building of a 200 ft train track in his own house, and a fundraising drive to buy a film projector for the school. \nThe magazines are also interesting for their portrayal of other countries, and the use of implicit and explicit racial and gender stereotypes.\n1928 saw the children out of school for more than a month, and at least one dying due to the measles epidemic, the King fell worryingly ill, and Bishop\u2019s own father died. After this terrible year, the volume ends on a high note as the Magazine celebrated its twenty-first year in production.",
