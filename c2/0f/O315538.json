The lower end has been rolled and stitched, and the upper end has been cut. \n\nThe main decoration consists of five coloured and embroidered stripes. Each one is a blue angular stem from which pairs of blossoms hang. The colours used are pink, cream, beige, green and yellow, and a metal thread of copper stripe around a white silk core. The stitch is an irregular tent stitch although the metal thread is just loosely caught on the surface. \n\nIn between these coloured stripes are four stripes of whitework - V-shaped leafs worked in satin stitch with silk. Some type of faggoting has been used to pull the ground threads together.\n\nA band of cross stitch is along the lower end and there is evidence of odd stitches scattered around.",
