As a designer, Messel accumulated many objects that caught his eye, some of which he then used for reference in his stage designs.  \n\nThe art of making beaded flowers is particularly associated with France.  The smaller examples in Messel's collection were probably costume accessories, to trim coats or evening dresses.  \n\nThe size and weight of the largest of the largest sprays suggest that they may have been intended as room decorations, possibly displayed under a glass dome.  Another possibility is that they were made as funeral tributes.  There is a long history, particularly in European Catholic countries, of beaded and ceramic funeral sprays and wreaths.  \nThe design and making of the flowers is of high quality.  The overall silver-grey beading is relieved of monotony by the wide range of flower forms used and the occasional judicious use of orange, blue and green beads.",

The designs were briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being housed at the V&A from 1981 on indefinite loan.  The V&A Theatre Museum purchased the Oliver Messel collection from Lord Snowdon in 2005.",
