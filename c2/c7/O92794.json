This is the scene of the Offering of the Four Alms Bowls by the Four Lokapalas.   The Buddha sits in the centre on a broad socle decorated with mouldings and a saw tooth pattern.   The  Buddha does not wear a sanghati, but only an antarvasaka and an uttarasanga, a type of clothing  which seems to have become popular during the second half of the 3rd century.   His left hand lies on his lap clasping the four alms bowls fused in one, covering with his right hand to protect it.  He has long ears and the hair curves to the top forming a spherical usnisa.   Behind the head spreads out a large unarticulated nimbus limited laterally by two hanging branches of the bodhi tree.  The lokapala arriving from the right, presents his gift to the Master. On the upper margin of the work  a deva floats in admiring worship.",
