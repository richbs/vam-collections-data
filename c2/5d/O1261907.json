This print forms part of a portfolio of caricatures, Stage Folk: A Book of Caricatures by Frueh, published by Lieber &amp; Lewis in 1922.  It was exhibited at the Theatre Museum in Theatre Caricatures by Al Frueh: West End Meets Broadway, in 1990.\n\nFrancis Wilson (1854-1935) and De Wolf Hopper (1858-1935) were comic actors who performed in many Gilbert and Sullivan productions together in America.  Wilson remained in America and formed his own theatre company in 1889.  In the same year Hopper became the founding president of the Actor's Amateur Athletic Association of America.  Hopper's first appearance on the London stage was in El Capitan by John Philip Sousa at the Lyric in 1899, in which he had also starred in New York during 1896.",
