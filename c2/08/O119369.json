It was probably made by the Staffordshire firm of Elsmore and Forster, Clayhills Pottery, Tunstall, which operated between 1853 and 1871 and specialised in this type of presentation ware. They produced various examples of presentation mugs and jugs, all decorated with engraved images relating to popular entertainment, so it seems that they had acquired a stock of old prints which were reproduced in different combinations on various-sized jugs.  This clown print and Harlequinade figure group also feature on similar Elsmore and Forster jugs, including the more sophisticated jug in the Theatre Collections, S.209-1998.",
