It contains enough cloth to make one garment.  Both sexes wore kimono, but the design of this particular length of fabric suggests that it would have been used for a woman's clothing.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe pattern of bamboo and flowering trees was created using a resist-dyeing technique. Rice paste was applied to certain parts of the cloth to form a protective coating that prevented penetration of the dye. Once the dye was dry the paste was washed away. Different areas were protected at various stages of the patterning process.\n\nTime\nJapanese objects were imported into Britain in large numbers in the second half of the 19th century. Japanese dyed textiles were very different from those made in Britain. The bold design and bright colours of this length of cloth would have been highly appealing. Fabrics like this would have been used to make exotic garments or used for interior decoration.\n\nHistorical Associations\nJapan was keen to show off its textile skills at the big exhibitions that took place in Europe in the 19th century.  This length was shown at the Paris International Exhibition of 1867 where it was bought by the Museum.",
