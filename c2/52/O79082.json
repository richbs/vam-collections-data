Like cats, they always landed on their feet, with three spokes facing down for legs and three facing up.  This one has three legs, with a swivelling top holding three screw-in arms.\n\nOwnership & Use\nSmall stands such as this took up very little space and were convenient to carry about. This example was used to hold plates. Sometimes plate stands were made of brass so they could be placed in front of the fire without being singed by the heat. Similar wooden 'cats' were probably used to support bowls of flowers or ladies' work baskets.\n\n",
