They were often elaborately carved or otherwise decorated.  This pipe is carved with a scene of Napoleon, then a young military leader, at the head of his troops on the bridge at Arcole, Italy.  The battle was fought between the 15th and 17th of November 1796, against Austrian troops. This pipe bowl was probably made only a few years later.  Napoleon became a mythical hero in his lifetime, hated and feared through much of Europe but also admired for his military prowess.",
