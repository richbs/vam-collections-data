The sash  is woven with a shot effect in blue and red, and with very narrow stripes of black, bearing a repeat of an S-pattern in white.  At either end is a knotted silk fringe in brown , blue and white.\n\n1975 Description: The pattern is a reversed S-motif.\n\n1997 Notes: The weave is a 1/3 twill.  the weft is purple silk; the warp is dark brown, brown, blue and white silk braided at the ends to form a fringe.  The warp is arranged in stripes: on one face they are white and blue with dark brown appearing in the white stripe for form a reversed 'S'.  On the reverse face the stripes are brown and white with dark brown appearing in the white stripe forming a faint 'S'.  Where blue appears one face, brown appears on the other.  Occasionally the blue is missing and the combination of brown warp and purple weft gives the appearance of a red stripe.",

The effect of interchanging and floating warp threads does imitate the jaspe patterning so popular in Guatemala.  This piece is similar in general appearance to T.30-1931 which definately is Guatemalan and done in the jaspe technique.  It would certainly have bene easier to imitate the jaspe by mechanical weaving.   See T.87-1931 for general information on shawls and jaspe in Guatemala.\n\nKrystyna Deuss, Director of the Guatemalan Indian Centre, London (personal communication, 1991): ' Imported from the Comitan area of Mexico for use in Jacaltenango.'\nAnn P Rowe, Curator of Western Hemisphere Textiles, The Textile Museum, Washington DC (personal communication 1997): 'The rebozos in the Maudslay Collection look much morel like Mexican rebozos than like any Guatemalan examples I have seen.  The Eisen Collection, made in Guatemala in 1902, contains nothing similar.  Mexican rebozos, both old and new, use more finely spun yarns and have narrower stripes than do Guatemalan ones.  The presence of other Mexican textiles in the Maudslay Collection means that this attribution is not out of line.'",
