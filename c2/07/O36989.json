When wound up the plane moves on two wheels set under the centre area and connected to the mechanism; there is a balancing wheel at the back. At the same time, a metal lever under the plane comes down, lifts it off the ground and somersaults it, however, the movement should turn the plane completely over but tends to stop once the plane is on its back.",
