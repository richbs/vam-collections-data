This technique is known as pouncing. The pattern thus outlined in blue chalk on the textile could  then be embroidered.  Numerous pinholes in all four corners show how the design was pinned to a textile beneath.  The amount of pinholes suggest that the design was used numerous times.\n\nThis design is one of a group of twenty-six designs for embroidery.\nReason For Production: Retail",
