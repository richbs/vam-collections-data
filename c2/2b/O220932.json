He was based at the computer centre at McGill University, Montreal, in the late 1960s. \n\nMilojevi\u0107's artworks were included in Cybernetic Serendipity, a groundbreaking exhibition held at London's Institute of Contemporary Arts in 1968. According to the Cybernetic Serendipitycatalogue, the programming was \"done in Fortran and processed on the IBM 7044. The figures themselves were done on the Calcomp  565 plotter. The cubic figures were obtained by connecting certain points on the sides of a cube, with the positions of the lines changed by translation or rotation\" (p.94)\n\nThis photographic reproduction of a plotter drawing was donated to the V&amp;A by the Computer Arts Society, which organised a number of exhibitions in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nMilojevi\u0107 also featured in the Tendencies 4 exhibition held in Zagreb in 1968-9.",
