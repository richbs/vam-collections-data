This form of mortar was developed in the 18th century in Europe.  It was intended to fire explosive shells over walls and the heads of enemy troops. The range was altered by varying the charge of gunpowder and the weight of projectile. However, the relatively small size which is comparable with a Coehorn mortar suggests an anti-personnel use.",
