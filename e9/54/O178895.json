Wealthy women owned many pairs suited to different occasions and carefully chosen to match particular outfits. Strict rules applied to the wearing of gloves. A woman would be considered undressed if she left the house ungloved and it was customary, for instance, to keep gloves on in church, at the theatre and at balls but to remove them before dining.\n\nThese buff-coloured kid gloves are typical of day gloves worn by women throughout the 19th century.  A slim, elegant hand was considered a sign of good breeding and women's gloves became ever closer fitting. The cuffs have a scalloped edge and two small clear glass buttons provide a fastening at the wrist. The decorative pointing on the back also make the hand appear more slender. The fashion for pale coloured soft kid leather was the subject of much discussion in etiquette manuals of the time. It was considered extremely bad form to wear discoloured or worn gloves, leading some to claim they 'can only be worn once'. This particular pair appear well worn and are stained and frayed on the fingers.",
