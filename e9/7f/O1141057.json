            "public_access_description": "This is a design for a mat to be manufactured from coir. Coir is a coarse fibre found between the husk and the outer shell of the coconut. It is often used to make products such as matting and ropes. The raw material had been used for centuries in the East, but only in the late 19th century did it begin to established its presence in the West often as a household product such as a mat. Initially, European business men set up businesses in Kerala, India. Centred around the town of Alleppey, the first factory was established in 1859. Other American and European investors followed, whilst Indian companies, such as S. Pitchu Iyer and Co., were also quick to see the potential.\n\nIt is likely that this design was created in the 1920s or early 1930s by a company set up by native entrepreneurs in Alleppey. The object is interesting because it draws on the Western styles of the period, using Art Deco motifs, and thus seems to have been designed for a European or an American market. At the same time, there is an overt Oriental influence. The group of designs to which it belongs makes frequent use of figurative botanical motifs, multiple wavy lines and flecks which differentiates it from classic Art Deco designs of the period.",
