It differs in its detailing and the painting appears less assured, which possibly points to it being a replacement tile made as a restoration.  It shows a half baluster-shaped vase on the left hand side with a scrolling arabesque pattern highlighted in white with touches of blue.  The green leaves rising out of it are serrated.  The other side of the tile has a yellow ground on which a spray of flowers rises out of an orange dish.  The spray contains orange tulips, grey daisy-like flowers with highlights of blue and white and poppies with orange and blue petals.",

He had been living in Srinagar where he had been Director of the Technical Institute of Kashmir and wrote to the museum in 1922 offering to sell his collection before he left that year to return to the UK.  The tiles are said to have come from the tomb of Madani near But Kadal in Srinagar, Kashmir.  The building dates from the mid-fifteenth century, but it was refurbished by a Mughal nobleman in Shah Jahan\u2019s time. The tiles were probably made in Lahore.",
