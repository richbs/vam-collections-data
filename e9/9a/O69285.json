This might be a halo, which would indicate that the young man was of saintly status, but we cannot be sure of this. The loose, free style of drawing is similar to that found in other fragments which are believed to have been painted in or around Oxfordshire. It is likely that this image formed part of a larger panel in a church.\n\nIn contrast to traditional stained glass, which was coloured with metallic oxides when molten, this fragment was decorated using a technique introduced to England in the early part of the 14th century. This consisted of painting a compound of silver on the back of the glass. After firing in the kiln, the silver compound would turn yellow. Many panels from the 14th and 15th centuries are decorated simply in yellow (silver) stain and highlighted with a brown-black pigment. Since the technique reduced the amount of leading required, it allowed greater freedom of composition.\n\nThe religious conflicts that affected the British Isles in the 16th and 17th centuries had a devastating effect upon the decorative arts and furnishings of the Christian church. Much of the medieval stained glass in churches and cathedrals was damaged and only survives in a fragmentary state.",

As a result, much of the glass from this time survives only in a fragmentary state.\n\nIn contrast to traditional stained glass, which was coloured with metallic oxides when molten, this fragment was decorated using a technique introduced to England in the early part of  the 14th century. This consisted of painting a compound of silver on the back of the glass. After firing in the kiln, the silver compound turns yellow. Many panels from the 14th and 15th centuries are decorated simply in yellow (silver) stain and highlighted with a brown-black pigment. Since the technique reduced the amount of leading required, it allowed greater freedom of composition.\n\nThis fragment shows the head of a young man wearing a crown. Behind his head are the remains of a circle with a border of yellow (silver) stain. This might be a halo which would indicate that the young man was of saintly status but we cannot be sure of this. The loose, free style of drawing is similar to that found in other fragments which are believed to have been painted in or around Oxfordshire. It is likely that this image formed part of a larger panel in a church.",
