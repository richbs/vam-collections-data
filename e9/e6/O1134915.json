These motifs are crafted through a variety of materials and techniques: embroidered suede, chenille, polyester lurex, sequins, beads and appliqu\u00e9. It is a fine example of the highly decorated and intricately detailed fantasy knitwear designed by Beth Brett. Born in London and educated in the United States, Brett returned to London to set up her knitwear business. Brett's highly designed and decorated women's fashion knitwear was sold to influential retailers in London, USA, Canada, Hong Kong, Japan and Australia. Brett's designs were considered as \"wearable art\" by her clients. Her work is distinguished by a romantic appeal achieved through eclectic mixings of colour, texture and surface embellishment. \n\nGiven to the V&A by the designer's husband following her death in 2003, these objects are key examples of the fantasy knitwear that was popular during the 1980s.",
