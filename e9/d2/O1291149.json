As Cyril Beaumont describes it, 'the glade resounds to the laughter and shouts of merry peasants who seek to forget their labours in the rapture of a country dance. Handkerchiefs leap from sleeves and dainty bosoms to flutter gaily in the wind.' \n\nThe illustration appears as the final picture in Cyril W Beaumont Impressions of the Russian Ballet 1919 Childre's Tales p.15\n\nChildren\u2019s Tales originally danced under the title Contes Russes was a \u2018Peoples\u2019 Play\u2019 composed by L\u00e9onide Massine to music by Anatol Liadov (Liadof) with a\nPrelude and Lament added 1918 and orchestrated by Arnold Bax. Scenery, Curtains and Costumes were designed by M. Larionov. This ballet evolved gradually and the revised production was first performed in London by the Ballet Russes on 23 December 1918 at Coliseum Theatre.",
