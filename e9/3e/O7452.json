It depicts St Peter kneeling in a boat with fish swimming in the bottom foreground. Behind him stand two angels. One holds five small figures of armoured knights, the other of nuns. St Peter holds out his hands, and on the right we see a hand presenting two keys to him. Surrounding the hands is a halo bearing the words \u2018Dabo tibi\u2019, which refers to the Gospel account of Jesus Christ giving the keys of heaven to Peter. \n\nPeter was originally a fisherman called Simon. He and his brother Andrew were fishing on the Sea of Galilee when Jesus called them to become his disciples. Simon became known as \u2018Peter\u2019 when Christ chose him to be the rock (Latin: petra) on which he would build his church, giving him the keys. Although the imagery in the panel relates to these events, we do not know why the two angels hold small figures of knights and nuns. This might be relevant to the place for which the panel was made, but sadly this is unknown. \n\nIn 1857 Burne-Jones began a brief contract with the glass-making firm of J. Powells & Sons in London to supply them with designs for stained glass. He was to be paid a flat fee for this work. Powells would retain the right to reproduce his designs as often as they wished.

It is not known why the two angels hold small figures of knights and nuns. It is possible that it could have relevance to the place for which it was made, sadly not known. Peter, or Simon as he was originally called, was a fisherman. He and his brother Andrew were on a boat fishing on the Sea of Galilee when Jesus Christ called to them to leave their profession and follow him ('I will make you fishers of men'). This is when they became disciples.\nSimon became known as 'Peter' when Christ chose him to be the rock (petrus) on which he would build his church and gave him the keys of the kingdom of Heaven. These two events are suggested by the imagery in the panel.\n\nBurne-Jones had been introduced to the glass-making firm of J. Powells and Sons in London by his fellow artist, Dante Gabriel Rossetti.
