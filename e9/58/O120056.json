Most individual panels are single-sided, but this one is double-sided, with (incomplete) carved ornament on one side, and linenfold on the other, suggesting that it may have been part of a screen that was seen from both sides. All over northern Europe in the first half of the 16th century, woodwork was decorated with a variety of renaissance ornament, such as the candelabrum, scrolling leaves or cherub's head on this panel. It seems to have been common within a room or on a single piece of furniture for carved renaissance ornament to be combined with more traditional, linenfold designs.",
