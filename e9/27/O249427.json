They are surrounded by a hollow rock and tufts of spotted grass.  A pair of birds dividing towards a tuft of grass and an island with its reflection of sharp hills and dwellings, act as dividers.  The plainer inside of the bowl has an inside rim decoration of eight lappets linked together by a continuous lobed line.  The well is plain.  A double line surrounds the centre and the squashed vase with roots.  Kraak leaves adn a flower emerge from a striped neck.",
