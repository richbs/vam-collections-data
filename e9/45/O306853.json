            "public_access_description": "This European-style ceramic chimney-piece and tile surround was commissioned around 1884-5, by a French composer of military music, Alfred Lemaire (1842-1907), along with several large tiles (see  510, 511, &amp; 512-1889). From 1868, Le Maire was working at Tehran's Dar al Funun (Abode of Sciences), a technical college, training the staff to teach music; he later composed Iran's first national anthem. By 1889, they were displayed in Paris, at the Exposition Universelle, owned by the French photographer Jules Richard (1816-1891), who had also worked at the college; he was the first foreign photographer to serve at the Iranian court.\n\nThe large tiles imitate the colourful, monumental seventeenth-century multi-tile panels that decorated palaces in Isfahan during the Safavid period. The subjects were typically of elegant courtiers drinking wine in lush gardens (see for example V&amp;A 139-1891). These subjects were popular with 19th century European tourists, as well as weathy Iranians, who had adopted Western fashions in interior decoration.\n\nAt the request of Major General Sir Robert Murdoch Smith KCMG, who puchased the Richard Collection for the South Kensington Museum (later the V&A), the potter, Ali Muhammad Isfahani who produced this scheme, recorded his methods and materials in a treatise On the Manufacture of Modern Kashi Earthenware Tiles and Vases, published in Edinburgh in 1888. Kashi, or Kasi, was the name used for enameled pottery and tile-mosaic work, as practiced in Iran and India\n \nFritware is a mixture of finely ground white flint stone and white clay. It is molded into flat panels and painted in colours based on minerals and metals, such as blue from cobalt, purple from manganese, black from chromium, yellow from iron or antimony, turquoise and green from copper, when dried it is covered with a transparent colourless alkaline glaze. Many of the colours run into the glaze during firing, so the outlines are drawn in black for sharper designs.",
