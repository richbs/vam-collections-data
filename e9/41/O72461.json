This unit, dated 1668, is made and decorated in the Anglo-Dutch style popular in England from about 1650. Behind its two lockable doors are a number of plain drawers.\nThe decoration consists of applied ornament in a range of materials. The mid-brown walnut is offset by mother-of-pearl and ivory inlay which has been incised and filled with a black paste to create simple floral designs. Instead of expensive, imported ebony for the dark panels, the walnut has been painted to look like ebony. The three vertical sections on the front (two stiles and a central muntin) have been decorated with applied balusters (made from split turnings) to evoke classical pilasters.",
