The outer frieze drawers are each set with a single handle of laurel-wreath pattern against a round back-plate and larger versions of these are set at either end of each large drawer, surmounted by a ribbon bow. The central panel of marquetry is set on the breakfront section, which runs, <i>sans traverse</i>, across both long drawers. It shows, against a ground of stained sycamore, a vase with flowers, all originally naturalistically coloured.  The panel is edged with purplewood and framed with gilt-brass, the corners of the sycamore panel inset with quadrans that are set with gilt-brass <i>paterae</i>. The front of the breakfront, central drawer at frieze level is set with a continuous gilt-brass mount of entrelacs, with a central keyhole but no handles. Below the main panel is a shallow plinth, below which is a shaped apron set with a symmetrical gilt-brass apron mount of foliage. \n\nThe commode is set with a slab of Carara Bianco marble, the edges moulded and shaped in plan to the outline of the commode, with canted front corners and curving sides. \n\n<u>Construction</u>\nThe case is built as a dovetailed box, the sides through-dovetailed to the case top and bottom.",

Although it is not marked with his stamp, he is known to have made several other commodes of closely similar form, also decorated with panels of floral marquetry. The earliest recorded ones were supplied for members of the royal family at Versailles in 1776. This commode is slightly less elaborate than those pieces, but certainly to the same design. When the collecting of French 18th-century furniture became a widespread fashion in the middle of the 19th century, Riesener became the most sought-after maker.",
