The figure has only two arms, which is unusual for Shiva, but has matted hair, a snake rears on his right shoulder, holds a trident and (possibly) a damaru drum.  He sits on a fully modelled lotus and slots into a four-legged base,  A separately cast arch fits the back of the base and (unusually) is pinned in place.  Although the modelling is relatively unsophisticated the shirne has elaborate moulded and incised detail.  Brassy colour, little wear.",
