Her initials appear beneath the royal crown on the marble door which opens to reveal a tortoise-shell lined interior compartment.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world\u2019s great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.
