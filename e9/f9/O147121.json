The jacket has a long inverted conically shaped opening [47 cm long], the neckband area being reinforced with the patterned silk.  It has a cross-over panel at the waist to hem level [left over right] with two inside ties, and a wider exterior tie on the  left flap and the right side, the latter made from the facing fabric while the former is a dark green plain weave cotton, and another of coarse mid-green cotton with a white resist pattern. The jacket is formed of one back panel, seamed at the shoulders, with variously shaped inserts down both sides, back and front, to form a hipped outline.  The sleeves, set at right angles to the main garment, are unseamed, joining at the underarms to the open gusset. A rough, probably not original bundle of stitches in white cotton is at the elbow area on each sleeve. The centre cuff is extended to form tiny points at the centre.  All openings are faced, including the hip side slits [21 cm long].\nMain Silk: yellow and metal thread ground patterned with a left facing boteh consisting of one flowering shrub in green, pink, blue with brown outlines.  A small right facing shrub motif separates the botehs at leaf level, a rosette at half way and a curving spray at the tip.\nWarp: pink and yellow silk.\nWeft: foundation = silver strip open S-wound on yellow silk core; light green, blue, pink and brown silk.\nAt the shoulder seam there is evidence of a loom end, with rows of pink weft.\nFacing: bias cut black plain weave silk\nLining: pieced plain weave cotton with yellow ground, block and resist printed with a flowering plant with serrated green leaves, pink, white flowers with yellow details, mostly outlined in black.
