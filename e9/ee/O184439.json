In his paintings, he sought to counter the influence of Western art as taught in art schools under the British Raj, by modernizing indigenous Moghul and Rajput traditions. His work became so influential that it was eventually accepted and regarded as a national Indian style within British and international art institutions.\n\nThe artist studied Japanese art under Japanese artists, Taikoan and Hilsida and assimilated Far Eastern techniques such as the wash into his work. His Omar Khaiyam series (1906-08) reflects such influences. Abanindranath\u2019s use of colour was also highly personalized and found its appropriate language in two major techniques: wash and tempera.\n\nThe print illustrates the Rubaiyat of Omar Khaiyam, a Persian poet, mathematician and astronomer (1048\u20131131). The artist has depicted this traditional subject in a highly romanticised style. Abanindranath dedicated the print to orientalist scholar Ernest Binfield Havell, the principal of the Government School of Art, Calcutta from 1896-1905. The inscription reads: \"To my guru H.B. Havell'' May 23, 1911, Calcutta.",

In his paintings, he sought to counter the influence of Western art as taught in art schools under the British Raj, by modernizing indigenous Moghul and Rajput traditions. His work became so influential that it was eventually accepted and regarded as a national Indian style within British and international art institutions.\n\nIn his work, Abanindranath retrieved themes from the Indian epic past or scenes from romantic tales, such as Arabian Nights or Omar Khaiyam and reworked them in a highly romanticised style. The artist\u2019s desire to emancipate Indian art from European influence was also fostered by Japanese artist Okakura Kakuzo, who visited him in 1902. Later, studying Japanese art under Japanese artists, Taikoan and Hilsida, Abanindranath assimilated Far Eastern techniques such as the wash into his work. His Omar Khaiyam series (1906-08) reflects such influences. Abanindranath\u2019s use of colour was also highly personalized and found its appropriate language in two major techniques: wash and tempera.",
