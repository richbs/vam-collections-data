Having started his career performing in pubs from the age of 15, he worked his way up the music industry ladder by playing in bands with his friends, eventually becoming a staff songwriter for DJM Records. On gaining a record contract in 1970, at the age of 23, his live performance became bigger and more flamboyant. Backed by a large catalogue of ballads and piano rock, his scintillating stage shows involved him performing in wild costumes, for which he commissioned spectacles to match.\n\nThis pair of sunglasses, with red and white plastic asymmetrical frames, decorated with an arrow picked out in white diamant\u00e9 studs, were designed for French designer spectacle house Mikli. Mikli began in 1978 and continue to this day, creating handmade glasses and accessories that are popular with celebrities worldwide.",
