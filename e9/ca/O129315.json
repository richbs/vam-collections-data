The glass negative is not known and the two V&A prints of this photograph are the only known prints.\n\nThis photograph was initially part of the photographic collection held in the National Art Library at the V&A. The markings on the mount are an indication of the history of the object, its movement through the museum and the way it is categorised.\n\nMount inscriptions -\n\nThe photograph is top mounted on cream board and shows the original handwritten  inscriptions:\n\nTop right corner: 'A.in. HAMPI'\nBottom left corner: 'School of Arts' overwritten with '<u>Hampi</u>: Krishna Dancing/ on the Snake. Carved stone pillar.'\nBottom right corner: '71,890./ Krishna dancing o--/ the Snake/ Carved Stone P--'\nVerso: 'Sch of Arts Madras'\n\nHistorical significance: The Vijayanagara empire ruled southern India from 1336 -1565. As India\u2019s last large state system prior to the British colonial takeover, it has been perceived as the final great era of 'traditional' Hindu India and also as a transitional phase which transformed Indian society from its medieval past towards its modern, colonial era. The empire built its imperial capital, Vijayanagara ('city of victory'), around the ancient religious centre of the Virupaksha temple on the south bank of the Tungabhadra River at Hampi, Bellary District, Northern Karnataka. Three dynasties ruled from Vijayanagara: the Sangama (1336-1485), the Saluva (1485-1505) and the Tuluva (1505-1565). By the year 1500,Vijayanagara was the second most populous city (after Beijing) in the late medieval world. The Vijayanagara rulers fostered developments in intellectual pursuits and the arts, warfare, engineering and agriculture, and were also great patrons of religion.\n\nThe ruins at Hampi represent the largest concentration of Vijayanagara architecture and are listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, known as 'the Group of Monuments at Hampi'. Vijayanagara architecture consists of religious, courtly and civic buildings and sculpture. Granite, the local and durable stone, was used with plaster applied to many sculptures to produce a smooth finish which was then gilded or colourfully painted. Its sacred architecture is characterised by a return to a more serene art of the past, taking elements from the Chalukya, Hoysala, Pandya and Chola periods, while its secular architecture fuses together Hindu and Islamic forms to produce a new, hybrid style. \n\nThis sculpted pier is found in the south face of the maha mandapa of the Vitthala temple. The sculpture depicts Krishna dancing on the snake.\n \nThe photograph is significant as both a visual record of structures within the Vitthala temple complex and as an example of photography at that time. Taken in the late 1860s when photography was considered both an art form and a tool of documentation, the  School of Industrial Arts' photographs present elegantly cropped compositions and technically proficient images of sculpture at Vijayanagara. Unlike the more usual picturesque treatment of architectural photography at Hampi at that time, these photographs have closely cropped compositions which often emphasize strong verticals and dynamic use of natural light.\n\nSince then, many of the sculptures have altered in appearance due to further disintegration, banditry, conservation, tourism and development, and some have been moved or disappeared altogether.",
