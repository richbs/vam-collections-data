The tradition on other islands in this area was to use a bed tent, often the spectacular centrepiece of the room's decoration, as the style of domestic architecture produced a square bed platform set in a corner of the room, requiring a tent rather than a simple curtain to provide privacy. \nIn Patmos, however, the room was divided by a wooden partition, with the bed placed behind it, so the opening in the partition was filled with a curtain like this one, with a central opening (which has here been joined).  Such curtains typically had gables in their decoration at the top to reflect their function as a doorway.",
