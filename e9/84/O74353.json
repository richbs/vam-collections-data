            "production_note": "Probably made in north Germany, possibly Berlin, where furniture with mahogany veneers and recessed panelling, along with emphasised (and often architecural) cube shapes were popular in this period.\n\nAttribution note: The quality of the cabinet work and the veneering is good; the wood veeners are well-matched.", 
            "historical_context_note": "This piece demonstrates the principles of the Biedermeier furniture style well - virtuosity in the use of veneers (the most important decorative elements of Biedermeier furniture), for example in the way the pattern of the veneer, which is cut from one piece of the tree, is continued all-over the surface of the piece, the shaping of the wood into circular shapes, the recessed diamond-shaped panel in the drawer and the circular recessed panel in the cupboard door. The recessed circular and diamond shapes were most popular in Berlin and in the north of Germany.",
