She is wrapped in a dramatically patterned black and silver evening cloak by Paul Poiret, which is lined in deep pink with long scarf ties edged with white and black fringing. The fabric of the cloak was probably designed by Raoul Dufy, who created many graphic textiles for Poiret. Poiret was one of the most influential and notorious designers of the late 1900s/early 1910s. By 1922, his designs had gone from being audacious and adventurous to being the height of fashion, and no longer as remarkable as they had been. For example, his 'robe de minute', a gown made of two rectangles of fabric, was created in 1911, 10 years before near-identically constructed chemise dresses became widespread (see T.118-1975). In 1922, the 'robe de minute' reflected the height of fashion and was the universally accepted mode.",
