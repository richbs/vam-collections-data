            "historical_context_note": "Acquired as by Primaticcio, the drawing was then catalogued as Emilian mid 16th century by Peter Ward-Jackson (1979). S. B\u00e9guin in 1982 reattributed the sheet to Primaticcio and connected it with the Gallery of Ulysses depicted by the Italian artist in the Chateau de Fontainebleau, France. The present drawing shows the left hand-side of a composition attributed to Primaticcio in the National Museum, Stockholm (NMH 828/1863). These two sheets are considered to constitute the first idea for a composition recorded in a 16th-century copy (Louvre, INV.8703) and subsequently engraved by Th\u00e9odore van Thulden (plate 29), c. 1633. It shows the 29th compartment of the Gallery of Ulysses, which was about 150 m long, and was destroyed in 1738 by Louis XV. The decoration of the gallery is recorded in descriptions, drawings and prints.\n\nThe present scene shows Ulysses taking leave of the King Alcinous who provides him a ship to return to Ithaca (Homer, Odyssey, 13: 53-95). In the background of the final composition, one can see the ship being prepared by Alcinous\u2019 attendants for Ulysses to depart. \n\nIt is likely that the decoration of the walls began only towards the end of the 1540s (B\u00e9guin, Guillaume and Roy, 1985) after the death of Rosso Fiorentino who had been entrusted by Francis I of the decoration of the castle. Primaticcio\u2019s leadership at Rosso\u2019s death caused a dramatic change in the decorative scheme. He opted for a very complex structure articulated around the story of Ulysses returning from Troy to his native island Ithaca. The scheme incorporated a variety of media to produce a rich effect.\n\nThe technique employed in Dyce.357, a black lead pencil called pierre noire, is not common in Primaticcio\u2019s output. However it has allowed Sylvie B\u00e9guin to date the sheet c. 1555. She believes it is a remarkable example of the use of this technique in Primaticcio\u2019s late period. The same technique can be found in a few other drawings such as the Victoria Gallica (Uffizi, Dimier 139, for the 4th compartment), a study for a Muse (Louvre, INV.8608, Dimier 95), and a study for a young warrior formerly in the collection of T.P. Clifford (compartement 10).\n\nThe Galerie d\u2019Ulysse was undoubtedly Primaticcio\u2019s masterpiece at Fontainebleau. Together with the other artists summoned from Italy by Francis I (Rosso Fiorentino, Perino del Vaga and Nicolo dell\u2019Abate), Primaticcio created rich and elegant style incorporating combinations of stuccowork, grotesques and illusionistic paintings. This style was later called \u2018school of Fontainebleau\u2019 and had a durable impact on French art. \n\nPrimaticcio had a great impact of French art during the 16th century. His designs inspired many contemporary artists, most of them having collaborated with him at Fontainebleau. His art, combined with the work of at Fontainebleau generated a stylistic school called school of Fontainebleau, whose designs were subsequently engraved and disseminated all over Europe.",
