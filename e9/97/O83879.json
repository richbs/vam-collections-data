The two sides are carved like a frieze in relief with the central projection sandwiched in between and carved in full relief. Horsemen wearing European costume wielding spears and muskets are shown charging down the length of the pilaster after lions with a deer rearing between the second horseman down from the top and a lion in front on the right sideof the pilaster, but closer to the top in front of the first horseman on its left side. At the bottom on each side there is an elephant whose rider is stabbing a makara crouching on the base. At the top under the capital there are two attendants, the one on the right  side wielding two swords, behind clothed figures mounted on lions with spears. On the right side there is a seated elephant.",

Gazeteer XVII pp. 334-5.\n(2) Made for the Raja of Mahishadal, Midnapore District\n\nLions and mounted Europeans are depicted alternately in an aggressive chase intermingled with bovine and cervine victims of the hunt. At the top of the pilaster the chase is driven forwards by Durga on her lions and her attendant 'yoginis' while at the bottom the whole movement is stopped by mounted elephants supported by water monsters ('makara'). As Stella Kramrisch has pointed out (1968), p.110, similar conceptions function as corner profiles on some Bengali carved brick temples.\n\nSee also Mukul Dey [1959], pl.40 and Gangoly [1959], pl.20, p.IV, who correctly sees this as a variation of the 'shardula' motif.\n\nAn old note accompanying the pilasters may be correct in saying that the temple car was dismantled in favour of a less heavy one after seven men were crushed beneath its wheels on the last occasion of its use. \n\n",
