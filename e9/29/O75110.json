Though modest in size, its vivacity sets it apart from the more stiffly posed, reserved works of many of his contemporaries in miniature painting. It is indicative of Sullivan's very different artistic background. He began as an engraver and assistant to the influential painter and print-maker William Hogarth, and spent the 1750s at the heart of London's artistic life. Like most of the artists of that time, Sullivan clearly assimilated elements of the French Rococo, a decorative style characterised by a serpentine sense of rhythm and freedom, a graceful spontaneity and frivolity.\n\nInterestingly, this miniature is less like a portrait of a sitter posed for a likeness, than a decorative picture: the girl with her music in hand, her lips slightly apart as if held in mid-song, her body and her eyes inclined towards her audience. The conceit could reflect the popularity on the print market of so-called \u2018fancy pictures\u2019. These were single decorative images of young women caught in mid-action, for example, washing, or selling goods such as ballads.",
