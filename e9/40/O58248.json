Instead of blowing into a mouthpiece, the player works a bellow, which lies across his chest or shoulder. Softer sounding than the Highland version, it is mostly played indoors. The Dukes of Northumberland have employed Northumberland pipers since about 1752, and various societies have helped to maintain interest in this instrument from the 1890s onwards. The most important maker was Robert Reid of Newcastle and North Shields (1786-1837), who probably made this instrument.",
