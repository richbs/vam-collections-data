It was made at the small porcelain factory owned by Charles Gouyn, the former partner of Nicholas Sprimont at Chelsea.  Gouyn seems to have parted company with Sprimont in about 1747 and there is documentary evidence to suggest that he set up his own porcelain factory in or near to Piccadilly in London and continued to make porcelain until about 1761.  It is thought that figures and larger models were only made in the early years, however, and the majority of the factory's products were small seals, scent bottles and teawares.  Gouyn was based in Bennet Street in St James from 1736-83 where he had his own jewellery retailing business.",

English Ceramics Circle Transactions, Volume 18, part 3, 2004, pp 398-407. Illustrated fig. 3, p. 399. The Marquis of Granby seal illustrated fig. 10 was probably made after the Marquis's victory at the Battle of Warburg, 31st July 1760, thus extending the factory's period of production to that year or the following one.\nErrol Manners states p. 400: 'The well-known 'Girl-in-a-Swing' dancing girl is a much simplified and almost childlike but beautifully poised and alert version of the Chelsea raised anchor Columbine (3 and 4).  In this instance it is as if it were done from memory or perhaps from a rough sketch.  The Chelsea figure dates from c. 1751 and is probably one of the earliest models copied from the Meissen figures lent by Sir Charles Hanbury-Williams in May of that year.  The 'Girl-in-a-Swing' modeller was not a trained sculptor like Willems but he did however have a great natural flair; in the words of A. Lane 'his knowledge of anatomy was rudimentary but in 'porcelain-sense', in instinctive understanding of the material, he surpassed all his English contemporaries'.  Likewise the hurdy gurdy player, the pair to the dancing girl or Columbine, seems to be an even more na\u00efve version of the figure that Willems copied so skillfully from Meissen (5 and 6).'",
