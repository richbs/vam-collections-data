They were also made in tin-glazed earthenware decorated in Chinese style.\n\nThe potters of Delft made such products to compete with the very sought after and expensive porcelains imported by the Dutch East India Company from China. Most of the pottery in made in Delft during the seventeenth century was painted in blue on a white, tin-glaze ground, in imitation of Chinese porcelain.",
