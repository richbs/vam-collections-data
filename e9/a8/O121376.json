Beethoven was born in Bonn but moved to Vienna in 1792 when Haydn invited him to study with him, and lived there until his death. Unlike any other composer before him, his music made him a great public figure and when he died 10,0000 people were said to have attended his funeral.\n\nThis bust is made of Parian or statuary ware, which was a fine-grained, waxy porcelain resembling white Parian marble, developed in the 1840s by Copeland and Minton.  Parian ware items were much admired at the Great Exhibition in the Crystal Palace, London in 1851, and in New York's own Crystal Palace Exhibition of 1853, and soon became a favourite medium for portrait busts and parlour ornaments. This continental bust was probably produced in the mid to late 19th century, along with busts of other famous composers including Mozart, Haydn and Wagner.",
