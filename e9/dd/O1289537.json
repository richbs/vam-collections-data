Her white collar, bow and short skirt fly out as she jumps. The background evokes the set of the ballet, Parade.\n\nParade was created by Jean Cocteau (who had the idea and wrote the libretto), Pablo Picasso (designing his first ballet), Erik Satie (composer), with choreography by L\u00e9onide Massine. It received its premiere at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet, Paris on 18 May 1917. This drawing was probably made by White when the ballet was first performed in London in 1919. \n\nThe drawings by Ethelbert White were commissioned by the bookseller and publisher Cyril Beaumont and appear to have be intended as possible illustrations for a small book in the Impressions of the Russian Ballet series. Beaumont published twelve volumes documenting eleven ballets between 1918 and 1922.\n\nThe Theatre &amp; Performance Collections at the V&amp;A includes three glass plates by Lachmann showing Maris Chabeleska who created the role of the Little American Girl in Paris in 1917 wearing the costume. She did not dance this role in London where it was first danced by Tamara Karsavina.",
