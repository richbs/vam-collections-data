The first World Cup took place in 1930.\nHe attended the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris and then specialised in the naked female form, as a subject for medallic sculpture. From 1901 Lafleur exhibited regularly at the Salon des Artistes Francais, at the Salon des Independants and at the Salon d'Automne. Lafleur was awarded a gold medal and on August 8, 1920 he was nominated to the grade of Chevalier of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur.\n\nPlaquettes are small plaques made of bronze, brass, lead or precious metals. They originated in the 1440s with the desire to reproduce coins and hardstone engravings from ancient Greece and Rome. Some were made as collector's pieces, to be viewed and displayed in private, and others for practical purposes. They also inspired designs in other media, from architecture to bookbindings.",
