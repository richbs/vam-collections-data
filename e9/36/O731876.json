A lithograph is a picture made by printing from a flat surface (traditionally stone, now often a metal plate), on which the artist draws or paints the original design with a greasy substance like chalk. The surface is next prepared, moistened and inked; the greasy printing ink adheres to the design, which is then printed onto a sheet of paper. \n\n\n\nSubjects Depicted\n\nFor this poster The Beggarstaffs (brothers-in-law James Pryde and William Newzam Prior Nicholson) designed the image of a girl with a basket of groceries. There is no reference to the product being advertised except for the lettering. The Beggarstaffs insisted on retaining artistic control over their designs refusing to include reference to the product being advertised.\n\n\n\nDesign & Designing\n\nThe Beggarstaffs collaborated together between 1894 and 1899 and designed their posters using the collage technique and stencilling. The text was created using scissors, which allowed for careful placement of the lettering in the design; this became a characteristic of their later posters. The use of a single dramatic image and of broad areas of flat colour is typical of their work. The background is the same colour as the girl's hair and basket, allowing the areas of text and image to merge into a unified scheme. The large area of yellow in this poster, unusual compared to The Beggarstaffs' preferred sombre colour schemes, would have distinguished this poster from surrounding advertisements.\n\n",
