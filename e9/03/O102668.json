'Gypsy' blouse gathered into a narrow waistband, with low round elasticated neck cut on curve into a V neck at the front to the midriff, held at the top of the curve with a narrow bar edged with gold lurex; the sleeves are cut into the neckline, forming the shoulder.  Over the midriff is a large round sided triangle in cyclamen chiffon, decorated with a stylized floral design in tiny beads, pearls and sequins, from base corners of which hang strings of bugle beads, minute gold flowers and gold drops, caught up into tiny loops.  Into the waistband is pleated a peplum cut on a curve at the front edges, which finish either side of the triangle.  The neck back and front are edged with a narrow gold lurex braid.  The blouse fastens with press studs behind the triangle.  The blouse is lined in cyclamen art georgette.",
