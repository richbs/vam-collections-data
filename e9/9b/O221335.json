Robbins, who was one of the exhibitors at Cybernetic Serendipity, a major exhibition held at London's Institute of Contemporary Arts in 1968.

The Cybernetic Serendipity exhibition catalogue contains a number of computer-generated designs by Robbins, including this one (p.80). \n\nThe V&amp;A also holds a photographic reproduction of the original painting by Steele. Both were donated to the Museum by the Computer Arts Society, which organised a number of exhibitions in the late 1960s and early 1970s.",
