The Museum had bought the Castellani Collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the same exhibition, and chose jewellery in the traditional style from other countries to show the differences and similarities between different cultures.  The main purpose of all these acquisitions was to help improve the quality of design among British artisans.\n\nIn the acquisitions register, this brooch is described as having been bought from Mr Tostrup for \u00a32 15s 2d.  Norwegian silversmiths working in the main towns had started to make fashionable jewellery in traditional Norwegian styles in the 1860s, and Jacob Tostrup was one of the leaders of this movement.  Although this brooch was bought from Tostrup, it carries the marks of Tor Grinderud, an accomplished silversmith, based at Lunde in Telemark, who also specialised in the new kind of filigree.",
