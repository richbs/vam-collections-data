They were trials of patterns and stitches that had been copied from others, and records of particular effects achieved that could be recreated again. This is a type known as a band sampler. With the composition of band samplers comes the first clear indication in England of the form being used as a method of instruction and practice for girls learning needlework. This example has repeating patterns worked in cutwork (needle lace based on a woven ground, from which areas have been cut away). Along the long edges there remain a few buttonholed loops by which the sampler was attached to an embroidery frame.",
