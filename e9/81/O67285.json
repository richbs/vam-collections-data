They are used to transport possessions on pack animals when the community travels and are used for storage and decoration, and as something comfortable to lean against, when the community settles for a while and erects tents.  The two sides of a bag, back and front, are called 'faces' and the one at the front is often decorated with knotted pile or with a woven design.\nThis bag face, probably made by the Saryk tribal group, was deliberately woven so that it is wider along the lower edge to provide ample storage space with a narrower opening to give security.",
