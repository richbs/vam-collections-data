The second character of the signature is, however, unclear and this, together with some other characteristics, including the relative thinness of the blade, casts some doubt on the authenticity of this attribution. All the mounts are of silver (except for the hilt fitting) and are signed by a 19th-century maker. The wooden scabbard has been lacquered in a rich scarlet and is decorated with a clump of autumn plants in gold and silver lacquer. \n\nAlthough the Muromachi period (1333-1568) is characterised by the mass production of swords, there were still many smiths of the Gokaden (the name given to the five main schools of sword production: Bizen, Mino, Soshu, Yamashiro, and Yamato) producing fine blades and introducing interesting and distinctive variations in the hamon patterns of the blade. At Seki in Mino, the traditions established by the smith Kaneuji were continued by a number of other smiths who all signed their names beginning with the character \u2018Kane\u2019, taken from the name of the founder of the school. \n\nKanefusa developed an especially undulating form of gunome choji-hamon that had rounded peaks and became known as \u2018priest\u2019s head\u2019 gunome. The cutting ability of Kanefusa\u2019s swords was clearly shown in the Edo period when one especially broad-bladed sword was allegedly used to cut through seven bodies in a test of the blade. This form of cutting test also illustrated the ability of the person using the sword.",
