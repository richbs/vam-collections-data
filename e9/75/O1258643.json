            "public_access_description": "Clive Head (British, born 1965) is a realist painter. Indeed most would describe his meticulous style as photorealist although he disavows that description of his work. His latest prints, Arcade (2012) and Terminus (2012), re-interpret in etching subjects which he has also addressed in painting. Terminus is a view of Victoria tube station, with the stairs from Terminus Place seen from below. In interviews Head has always insisted that the language of realism he uses is not the same as the language of photography, and it is true that his paintings do nor resemble photographs. Indeed, Head has been consistently critical of the futility of painters copying photographs. In this Head's previous work as a neo-classical painter is significant as his spatial constructions are derived from classical ideas of perspective rather than being imported from a camera, computer or other machine. In this it appears significant that Head has stated that his use of perspective is not bound by pre-determined rules in a mechanical way, but evolves during the process of making each individual painting a process a camera cannot match. This means there is no pre-determined vanishing point, where all the lines of perspective meet, but what Head calls 'vanishing zones'. Head has also stated he 'rejects the Modernist fragmentation and instead seeks a seamless surface.' \n\nThis print is on an unusually large scale, to enhance the sense that we are looking through a window into a fully-realised world. It was printed at Paupers Press, one of Britain foremost print studios.",
