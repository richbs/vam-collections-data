            "public_access_description": "This example of rock and pop merchandise takes the form of a scarf, a popular form of expressing your admiration for a particular pop star or band in the early to mid 1970s. Made of nylon, it wasn't made to be worn, but rather to be held up outstretched in the audience so that the band could see your adoration. This fashion came from the British phenomenon of having a scarf in your supported team's colours, and holding it up on the football terraces.\n\nGary Glitter was a performer who first came to prominence during the glam rock era of British pop music. He had a long chart run during the 1970s, including twenty-six hit singles. Although he'd been a performer since the 1960s, he became synonymous with the flamboyant glittery suits and platform boots from the glam period. His singing career continued throughout the 80s and early 90s with many greatest hits albums and revival shows, but he returned to major public attention in the late 1990s due to criminal convictions in the UK and Vietnam.",
