It was drawn at a time when Bond was writing for a variety of theatres and on a range of subject matter. In 1978 he staged the premier of his play 'The Woman' in the National Theatre's huge Olivier auditorium,  departing from previous directors by choosing to open up the stage. Two years earlier he had written the short play 'Stone' (1976), for the gay rights theatre company Gay Sweatshop (of which Sher was a member) and in the year the sketch was drawn wrote 'The Worlds' (1979) a play about industrial unrest and terrorism, premi\u00e8ring at the Newcastle Playhouse and Half Moon Theatre, London.\nIn 1979 Sher had yet to begin his career with the Royal Shakespeare Company but was part of a group of young actors and writers working at the Liverpool Everyman which included writers Willy Russell and Alan Bleasdale and fellow actors Bernard Hill, Julie Walters, Trevor Eve and Jonathan Pryce.\n\nAlso from this period are: the short play Stone (1976), written for the gay rights theatre company Gay Sweatshop; and A-A-America (1976), a double-bill concerning racist violence in the United States.",
