Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. Above all they had to have the means of attaching the cord. In this example, there are a pair of holes (himotoshi) on the bottom of the sandal.  Although netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated is the katabori (shape carving). This is a three- dimensional carving, such as this netsuke. \nShishi is translated as lion and represents a mythical protective animal that is often depicted guarding Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples. Often in pairs one shishi has its mouth shut to represent peace whilst the other has its mouth wide open, like this netsuke, to ward away and repel evil spirits. Under the front paw is positioned a tama or sacred Buddhist jewel which has the power to bring light into the world.  \n\nThe intricate detailing of this netuke emphasises the animation of the shishi through its large, detailed mane, luxuriant coat and lively features. Encouraged by the popularity of woodblocks, netsuke artists began to replicate the graphic style of shishi presented in the prints as from the  Ehon Shoshin Hashiradate.",
