Vertical pencil lines have been ruled at the left- and right- hand edges.\n\nThe subject was described when the drawing was received in the Museum as \u2018Sketch of ships drawn up on the shore of a tidal river: the Orwell (?) near Ipswich\u2019 (<i>Inventory of Art Objects 1888</i>) and this description has been substantially maintained since.  But no opposite shore is visible, and it appears that the boats are drawn up on a beach.  The probability is that the sketch is one of those made by Constable while on a visit to Brighton between 1824 and 1828.  The was in which the outlines of the clouds are drawn, apparently with the point of the brush, may be compared with Nos. 275-277 [171-1888, 340-1888, 245-1888].  Holmes, p. 238, dates c. 1799.  It appears however that the roughness of the drawing is due to carelessness rather than to immaturity.\u201d",
