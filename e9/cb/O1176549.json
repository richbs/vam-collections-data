            "public_access_description": "Black Sabbath were one of the most influential heavy metal bands of all time, helping to create the genre with ground breaking albums such as Paranoid. Their original sound focused on ominous lyrics and doomy music, in stark contrast to popular music of the early 1970s. This particular t-shirt was from their Heaven and Hell tour, to promote the album of the same name. This was the period just after Ozzy Osbourne was sacked as lead singer (1979) and replaced by Ronnie James Dio.\n\nWith t-shirts becoming a staple fashion item for youth and rock 'n' rollers in the 1960s, promotional t-shirts printed to advertise products also became common place. This trend moved from corporate arena to youth movement with the merging of rock 'n' roll, advertising and fashion into the creation of the concert t-shirt, of which this is an example. Not only does it advertise a concert the wearer has been to, but concert and band t-shirts can also show the wearer's allegiance to specific musical subcultures or youth movements.",
