This information is not recorded for this casserole and cover but it is assumed that it too was acquired for the 1871 exhibition and was probably made in 1870.\nAt the time of acquisition, it was recorded that this casserole had been made in Heimberg and given a date of about 1875.\n\nWyss (see Refs) illustrates a dish, a cup and saucer and a milk jug with similar decoration to this casserole. He attributes them to the David Andere workshop in Heimberg. The dish is dated 1860. The whole assemblage is dated 1850 to 1870.",
