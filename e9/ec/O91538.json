Hildburgh travelled widely on buying expeditions, usually recording when and where he bought something, but not (frustratingly for posterity) from whom. He added over 500 objects to the collection either as gifts or as part of his magnificent bequest which came to the V&A in 1956. This casket was on loan to the Museum from 1925 and turned into a gift in 1953.",
