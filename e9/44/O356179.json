Their provenance is not known, but they may have been acquired by the Huttleston Rogers family as examples of historical embroidery, or have been passed down through the Broughton family.\n\nThe donor, Major Ailwyn Broughton, is the grandson of Cara Broughton, n\u00e9e Cara Leland Huttleston Rogers (1867-1939), who married Urban Hanlon Broughton (1857-1929) in 1895. As Urban H. Broughton died before he could be elevated to a peerage, their eldest son Urban H.R. Broughton (1896-1966) became 1st Baron Fairhaven of Lode on 20 March 1929, while Cara became 1st Lady Fairhaven. This barony became extinct on Urban H.R.Broughton's death, but a later barony, Baron Fairhaven of Anglesey Abbey, co. Cambridge, was granted to him in 1961, with a remainder to his brother, Henry (1900-1973), to enable this title to continue after his death without male heirs. Henry's son, Ailwyn became Lord Fairhaven following his father's death.",
