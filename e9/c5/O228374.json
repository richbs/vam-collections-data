Like all Italian traditional jewellery, they often seem much more substantial than they really are.  The Italians have always loved lavish display, and even for the poorest, a rich show of jewellery was all important.  One of the most typical techniques in the south of Italy was the use of mixed colours of gold.  The goldsmiths often used yellow gold, mainly filigree, as a base, and attached flat shapes of red gold to its surface.  This technique was used for all kinds of jewellery, and is still in use today.\n\nThis ring was described as a wedding ring when it was acquired.  The design, of two hearts linked by a key, is certainly appropriate.  It was bought for 12 shillings as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
