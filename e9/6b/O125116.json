He later settled in London, and became a member of the stock exchange.  His interest in railways led to his election as an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1839, and he was director or chairman of two railway companies between 1843 and 1848.  Much of his time however was spent collecting pictures and works of art.  In his will he offered his collection of mostly German and Dutch schools to the National Gallery (which selected only three works) and to the Department of Science and Art at South Kensington, later the Victoria and Albert Museum.  The South Kensington Museum acquired ninety-two oil paintings and forty-seven watercolours.  A number of engravings were also left to the British Museum.",

            "historical_context_note": "The naturalistic quality of this painting reflects Patrick Nasmyth\u2019s method by which he made continual studies from nature before working them up into oils in his studio. He had a reputation for being a good meteorologist and his skies are always meticulously painted, as here. James Nasmyth records his brother\u2019s trouble in rendering these effects when he painted, \u2018the resting cloud, the rain cloud, the driving cloud\u2019, (Peter Johnson and Ernle Money, <i>The Nasmyth Family of Painters</i>, 1977, p.31).\n\nThe subject matter of 576-1870 also exemplifies James Nasmyth\u2019s assessment of the picturesque subjects favoured by his brother Patrick, \u2018\u2026 the decayed pollard trees and old moss-grown orchards, combined with cottages and farm-houses in the most \u201cpaintable\u201d state of decay, with tangled hedges and neglected fences, overrun with vegetation clinging to them with all the careless grace of nature\u2019, (Johnson and Money, 1977, p.31). This painting also reflects Nasmyth\u2019s absorption of 17th-century, Dutch landscape painting, particularly work by Jacob van  Ruisdael (1628/9-82) and Meindert Hobbema (1638-1709).",
