            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, pp. 233, 234-236\nThe following is an extract from the text of the entry:\n \n\u201cGiven by Lindo S. Myers.\n\nThis drawing was formerly in the collection of Eustace Constable. It is a greatly enlarged copy of the figure of the saint in a drawing attributed to Titian; the copy was shown by Constable at his first lecture on 'The History of Landscape Painting' at the Royal Institution on 26 May 1836. The original drawing, which was in the collection of Sir Thomas Lawrence, is now in the Mus\u00e9e Cond\u00e9, Chantilly; it is reproduced in the <i>Jahrbuch der Kunsthistorischen Sammlungen</i>, Vienna, N.F. X, p. 152, Abb. 130. Leslie (L. ed. S., p. 388) gives an account of Constable's long discussion of Titian's 'St. Peter Martyr' in the lecture, and records: \"Constable here showed a copy of an original sketch by Titian (one of the Lawrence Collection), in which the saint has the outlines of three heads drawn one over the other, the first looking down, the others more and more turned up, and said,- 'still this made the subject nothing more than a common murder by the roadside, and it wanted the dignity of a martyrdom. The composition was then heightened, the vision of angels introduced, and the head of the saint again altered, so as to look up to the glory that now beamed down on him'''. \n\n\nNote on Nos. 397-400 [D.1876-1908, D.1877-1908, D.1875-1908, D.1874-1908]\n\nFor the reasons given above, Nos. 397 and 398 [D.1876-1908 and D.1877-1908] can be identified with the drawings mentioned by Leslie as having been shown by Constable at his first lecture to the Royal Institution in 1836; and, on the assumption that those lectures (on which Leslie's notes are confessedly incomplete) incorporated all the material in his previous lectures and notes, Nos. 399 and 400 [D.1875-1908 and D.1874-1908] were probably shown at the same lecture. There is no direct evidence that he showed any of the drawings at the earlier lectures, for example, those at Worcester in 1835, though he is known to have shown a diagram of dates and names of the principal painters, and copies of pictures, on that occasion. Nos. 397 [D. 1876-1908], 399 [D.1875-1908] and 400 [D. 1874-1908] are virtually mechanical enlargements from the engravings, and are probably the work of an assistant. In a letter of April 1836 to Leslie (Beckett, Ill, p. 137) Constable says: \"<i>Nixon</i> is helping me with my tables for my lectures\". In the case of the Worcester lectures, the tables were literally the lists of painters, but in this context they may well be the copies of engravings which he showed at the Royal Institution. J. M. Nixon was a glass painter and the heavy 'leaded' outline of Nos. 397, 399 and 400 [D.1876-1908, D.1875-1908, and D.1874-1908] might be due to him. No. 398 [D.1877-1908] is in a freer style, more likely to be Constable's own. \nWhen giving the drawings to the Museum, Mr. Lindo S. Myers wrote on 23 May \n1902: \"They were purchased by me directly from Mr. Eustace Constable, together with many hundred later drawings and books of sketches by John Constable, and the whole of which (including these two) came from the Court of Chancery where they had been locked up in the will of Miss Isabella Constable\". Although the letter only refers to two drawings all four were in fact received from the donor at this time. Mr. Myers was under the impression that they were early works done by Constable as a boy under Dunthome's instructions: hence his reference to 'later' drawings in the above quotation. \nEustace Constable was the son of Capt. Charles Constable, the artist's second son. \nA collection of some 70 paintings and 200 drawings by Constable belonging to him was sold at Messrs. Christie's on 16 April 1896.\u201d",

He gave four lectures on 'The History of Landscape Painting' at the Royal Institution in May and June of this year and his last lecture, at Hampstead, on 25 July. Constable died on 31 March 1837. His almost completed painting 'Arundel Mill and Castle' (now in the Toledo Museum of Art, Toledo, Ohio; see No. 379 [260-1888]) was exhibited posthumously at the Royal Academy.' \n                                 \t\n[G Reynolds, 1973, p. 233]",
