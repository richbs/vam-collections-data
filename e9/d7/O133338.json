            "public_access_description": "Jacques-Raymong Brascassat (1804-1867) first trained with the landscape painter Th\u00e9odore Richard (1782-1859) in Bordeaux. He then studied under Louis Hersent (1777-1860) at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris and went to Rome where he befriended Th\u00e9odore-Caruelle d'Aligny (1798-1871), with whom he improved his study of nature. He later joined him in Barbizon upon his return to France. \n\nThis painting is a fine example of Brascassat landscape paintings often enlivened with animals such as goats, sheep or bulls. His work was influenced by the Dutch animal painters of the 17th century who extensively portrayed animals in sunny landscape. This painting shows Brascassat skills as an animal painter and his complete understanding of the bull's anatomy.",

Although he produced a few history paintings, he specialised in landscape paintings often enlivened by animals. This interest in rural subjects and detailed observation of nature is characteristic of the French Realist movement emerged in the 1840s. Despite his association with the Barbizon painters, his style dominated by a refine and luminous brushwork is reminiscent of the Dutch painters of the 17th century. 17th-century Dutch art aroused a new interest in the 19th century and was quite influential on such painters as Auguste and Rosa Bonheur. \nBy comparison with another version signed and dated 1855, Christie's New York, 8 Apr 2008, lot 47, one can assess that the present painting was probably executed around the same period. Brascassat seemed to have particularly favoured the depiction of bulls. Two paintings are particularly remarkable: <i>Two Bulls</i> in the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts, Bordeaux and <i>Bulls fighting</i> in the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts, Nantes.",

            "historical_context_note": "19th-century French art is marked by a succession of movements based on a more or less close relationship with nature. At the beginning of the century, Romantic artists were fascinated by nature they interpreted as a mirror of the mind. They investigated human nature and personality, the folk culture, the national and ethnic origins, the medieval era, the exotic, the remote, the mysterious and the occult. This movement was heralded in France by such painter as Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix (1798-1863). In its opposition to academic art and its demand for a modern style Realism continued the aims of the Romantics. They assumed that reality could be perceived without distortion or idealization, and sought after a mean to combine the perception of the individual with objectivity. This reaction in French painting against the Grand Manner is well represented by Gustave Courbet (1819-1877) who wrote a 'Manifesto of Realism', entitled <i>Le R\u00e9alisme</i> published in Paris in 1855. These ideas were challenged by the group of the Barbizon painters, who formed a recognizable school from the early 1830s to the 1870s and developed a free, broad and rough technique. They were mainly concerned by landscape painting and the rendering of light. The works of Narcisse Virgile Diaz de la Pe\u00f1a (1807-1876), Jules Dupr\u00e9 (1811-1889), Th\u00e9odore Rousseau (1812-1867), Constant Troyon (1810-1865) and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet (1814-1875) anticipate somehow  the <i>plein-air</i> landscapes of the Impressionists.",
