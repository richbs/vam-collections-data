It is floor length with a straight front and wide self-faced edges, and has a narrow band collar and wide straight sleeves and padded shoulders. The back of the coat is fitted as far as the waist where it becomes a wide inverted pleat extending into a train. A button, with a small mother of pearl flower centre, is stitched at the top of the pleat. Half way down the train is a 'fleur de lys'-shaped loop, which when attached to the button, holds the train up to give a bustle effect. \n\nThis coat is an example of the historicism which prevailed in fashion at the end of the 1930s, when fashion designers reinterprated the shapes of the leg-of-mutton shoulders and bustles of the 1880s. For Schiaparelli, cut was of paramount importance and her silhouettes were frequently described as having a strict neatness with angles replacing feminine curves. This evening coat, almost like a cardinal's robe, displays modern and forceful lines and a stylised simplicity. It is a striking example of Schiaparelli's calculated and balanced extravagance.",
