The front half base has been cut to accommodate an electrical mechanism to which is attached a lead. At the other end of the lead is a hand operated control panel to move the vehicle around. It is probable that Palitoy designers did the adaptation for use in exhibits and possibly advertising films. The back half is open at the top and rear. The underside of the back half is marked with the same identification as the box PLUS 141734. The whole is mounted on 6 wheels with black plastic tyres. There is one Action Man decal glued on.",
