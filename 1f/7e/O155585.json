The back and front neck sections have been reinforced with a band which continues down the 22.5 cm front slit.  All the edges except the sleeve ends are rolled and stitched, including the two side slits which are 12.5 cm long.\nThe centre front opening has 5 white buttons, which are probably glass, on the left hand side held in place with blue silk thread; on the right hand side are buttonholes worked with white thread.\nThe hems, side slits and sleeve ends are patterned with the same composite band of whitework  embroidery:\n[a] a regularly placed small plant motif in straight stitch;\n[b] a line of small trefoil shape in straight stitch;\n[c] two lines of small lozenges either side of a narrow row of small diagonal bands, all in straight stitch;\n[d] two lines of small squares composed of 4 triangles in straight stitch;\nThen a repeat of [c], [b] and [a].\nThe sleeve ends are turned and stitched and decorated along the edges with loops of white cotton plaited braid.  In the 4 corners of the hem panels, a small cypress motif with a bent top in pulled thread.\nThe silk embroidery thread is white Z-twist.\nCould this have been made for a European woman - the button holes are not typical of Iranian dress.",
