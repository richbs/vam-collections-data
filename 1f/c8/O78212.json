The lines on the plate are filled with ink, which is then printed onto paper.\n\nSubject Depicted\nThis print by an unknown engraver was included in John Guillim's A Display of Heraldrie, a book containing illustrations of coats of arms accompanied by explanatory texts. John Guillim (1565-1621) was an Officer of the College of Arms, the official repository of the coats of arms and pedigrees of English, Welsh, Northern Irish and Commonwealth families and their descendants. A Display of Heraldrie, which brought its author fame, was first published in 1610 and appeared in many editions until 1724. This print comes from a posthumous edition of 1679 dedicated to Charles II and contains 'A Treatise of Honour, Military and Civil, by Captain Loggan'.\n\nThe print shows King Charles II richly clad in robes of state and holding a military commander's baton in his right hand. His other hand rests on a shield or crystal globe, behind which is a wreathed Roman standard and a flag bearing the letters SPQR (senatus populusque Romanus - 'the senate and people of Rome'). These items symbolise Roman imperial military triumphs and the parading of booty.",
