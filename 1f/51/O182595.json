The main border is on 3 sides and has a quilted ground with a diamond pattern in white silk.  There are pairs of  very curved serrated leaves on a green stem which does not quite form a meander; the leaves enclose a red carnation. The inner border is the same design as the outer border; it is on three sides around the central rectangular panel. This panel is divided into a lobed niche.  The spandrels are filled with a pattern formed by pairs of yellow leaves outlined in light green which form an X-motif with a red diamond centre outlined in blue [sometimes this motif becomes a star or an asterisk], together they form an unconnected diamond lattice with a small pointed red trefoil flower in each diamond, the short green stems have worn away in many places. At the top of the niche is a roundel with a green ground and red inscription; there are 3 red trefoil flowers around it. The niche is patterned with offset bands of a floral stem with 3 red carnations and is quilted in a diamond pattern with white silk. \nBacking: white cotton.",
