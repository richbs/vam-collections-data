He was suspended two years later due to controversy over his handling of events leading up to the Mutiny and transferred to a less responsible, and less lucrative post. His subsequent bitterness towards the Company may have caused him to give his collection to the new South Kensington Museum, rather than the established Indian Museum in London which frequently received donations from people who, like Tayler, had formed collections in India or who gave items seized as loot in Indian campaigns.",
