He faces to the front, but his body is shown in <i>tribanga</i> pose with his right hip jutting out. He holds his rosary-encircled right hand up in an <i>abayhamudra</i>. He wears a necklace from which hangs a diamond-shaped fleuron and heavy armbands visible on his left forearm. He also has a scared thread looped over his left shoulder which snakes down to a jewelled belt just above his hips. The head of the god is overshadowed by a five-headed cobra. He also wears heavy earrings and his hair is brushed up under a crown which is overshadowed by an encircling aureole of five naga heads. The head of the god is overshadowed by a five-headed cobra.\n\nThe general style of the sculpture resembles that on the Temples at Khajuraho, Chhatarpur District, Central India..",
