This portrait of her in her costume for her most famous role Le cygne (The Swan), is by the distinguished painter Sir John Lavery. \n\nThe Swan was a short solo, created for Pavlova by choreographer Mikhail Fokine.  It  followed the last minutes of the dying bird's life, and was popularly known as The Dying Swan.  She wears a white tutu with stiffened wings over the skirt, her face framed in feathers and with a jewelled headdress. On her breast is a blue glass jewel.  Many dancers who later performed the solo wore a red jewel, suggesting that the swan has been shot, but the original idea was rather that the swan, at the end of its life, is drifting and drowning in the water.\n  \nPavlova was extremely exacting about her costumes. The tarlatan underskirts of her tutu had to be of exactly the right degree of starchiness. As she could not find what she wanted in either London or Paris, thousands of yards were sent from America every year. Her Swan costume was never worn more than twice without the tarlatan skirts being renewed.",

The latter, inspired by Pavlova's first London season, was painted in 1911 and shown at the Royal Academy the following year.  Pavlova's husband Victor Dandre did not feel the Royal Academy portrait was a good likeness and preferred the same artist's head of Pavlova in <i>The Bacchinale</i>, which had been the great success at the first night of her first London season.\nBequest of Mrs Leonore Lena Graham, 1989",
