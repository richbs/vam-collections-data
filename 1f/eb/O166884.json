            "public_access_description": "This ivory figure group representing the Baptism of Christ is made in Spain in ca. 1600-30. The two figures are carved in the round on a rough integral base. St John the Baptist stands on a higher mound on Christ's left, holding up a shell in his right hand with which he baptises Christ, who stands with his arms crossed on his breast. The style of the present piece, in particular the elongation of the figure of the Baptist, reminiscent of the work of El Greco, and the frontal, almost awkward, nature of the composition, as well as the surface treatment of the ivory, suggest that it is in fact Spanish.",
