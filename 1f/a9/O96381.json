Bought by the museum in 1972.\n\nHistorical significance: In producing small-scale bronzes Hendrick de Keyser was following a distinctive mannerist formula, in particular comparisons may be made with the bronzes by Giambologna. The bronzes he made may have coincided with his work on the monumental tomb of  William the Silent in the New Church in Delft, but they also convey Giambologna's principles and ideas relating to the North, although he was never part of the Florentine circle.",

The close stylistic relationship to the the bronze figure of Mercury in the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam, which is monogrammed and dated 1631 suggest an attribution to Hendrick de Keyser (1565-1621). The bronze was undoubtedly inspired by the marble statue with the same subject by the South Netherlandish sculptor Pietro Francavilla. This statue, dated 1598, and now in the Louvre, was taken - shortly after its cmpletion in Florence-to the Paris home of Gerolami Gondi, where it was installed at the centre of a fountain. Francavilla entered the service of Henry IV and Maria de ' Medici. Hendrick de Keyser may have made his acquaintance on a trip to Paris and seen the marble figure.",
