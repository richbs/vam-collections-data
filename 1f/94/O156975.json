            "public_access_description": "The etiquette of glove wearing was an important part of life in the nineteenth century and handbooks with advice on propriety were commonplace. Gentlemen were expected to wear gloves with day and evening wear. An 1837 entry in 'Hints on Etiquette' advises that at a ball 'it is better to run the risk of being considered ungallant, than to present a clammy ungloved hand.' Generally speaking physical contact was considered distasteful, but when inevitable it was more accepted with fabric as a barrier. While natural and muted colours such as buff, tan and white were the only shades deemed acceptable for evening, brighter colours could be worn during the day. Further distinctions were made between town and country wear.\n\nThis example of an early 19th-century man's glove is unusual in its bright colour scheme and bold design of dark blue, pink and white stripes. The embroidered zig-zag pointing along the back of the hand, and around the 'Quirk' (separate thumb piece), is in corn-coloured silk thread and in sharp contrast to its background. The glove is typical however, in its construction, material and length. Machine-knitted silk would have been worn for daywear and in less fashionable company. This glove is not lined, suggesting style is prioritised over warmth. Gloves of this relatively short length were most common at this time, in keeping with the lengthening of men's coat sleeves which often extended well below the wrist.",
