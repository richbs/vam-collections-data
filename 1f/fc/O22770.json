The train called at 40 different towns and attracted 400,000 visitors. One is reminded of the Russian Agitprop propoganda trains of a slightly earlier date.\n\nHere the mirrored vanity unit allows make-up to be applied in the bathroom rather than at the dressing table in the bedroom. The sink has no plug chain and must have been operated at the tap which in itself is of a modern fixed flow design. Again the lighting is non-direct.The advertising function of the whole train can be seen from the etched labels on the glass panels: 'No. 4 Fluted Sandblast' reads the one at far right.",
