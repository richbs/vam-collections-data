The ground was laid by the etcher and the work begun about the middle of May 1858, lasting for six weeks. Abridged these notes are as follows:- \n\n\"First biting in June 1. hour; with one part of Nitrous acid to 4 \u00bd of water. Hot weather, but no artificial heat used.\" In the sky, only the darkest bars of cloud and darker masses of cloud and azure - deep azure of moonlight were etched.\" \"All the sky stopped out. Great care used to do so neatly against distant hills and leaves of tree.\" Stopped out highlights on the backs of cattle and all the figure except extreme darks between folds of drapery . . . . removed, split, or narrowed with Brunswick black lines which were bitten too broad for their place, or were likely to embarrass. Removed, split, dotted or narrowed intersections of lines likely to become spots. S.O. the highest light in foreground.\" \n\n\"Second biting about one hour. . . . Stopped or dotted the deepest bitings in the distance. S.O. the smoke in cottage. Stopped over the broad lights on cattle. Stopped the figure wholly, and went over the whole, stopping, painting, dotting, or splitting the widening lines. . . . \" \n\n\"I think we may be free to use close hatching and repeated cross hatchings with the NEEDLE if very careful with the partial STOPPINGS.\" \n\n\"Third biting, June 21st 1 \u00bd hours-\" \"Mr. Barlow says that George Cook said that FIVE MINUTES of careful stoppings out, were worth a DAY'S WORK on the etching itself.\" \n\n\"June 22 began by minutely stopping out the now numerous places in the distance where the lines had bitten broad enough . . . stopped out round the figure a little beyond the outline. I also continued broken shadows strongly with the needle and in deep shadows split or mended parts which were biting too broadly.\" \"22nd June. Increased strength of acid from 4 \u00bd to 1 acid, to 4 water to 1 acid. Fourth Biting, \u00bc hour. S.O. hundreds of particles. . . . 23rd June. 5th Biting, \u00bc hour. Then stopped out whole of cattle &c., so the darkest parts of the cattle were bitten 4 hours. By this time nearly the whole of the distance was stopped. 6th Biting \u00bc hour, making the deepest shadows under the chestnut tree, and the darkest lines of shadow in near tree trunk 4 \u00bc hours.\" \n\n\"A new light bursts upon me! Let me have always a wiped and an unwiped proof and work from unwiped impressions - except in the focuses. Thus the work may have more of the vigour and texture of old woodcuts and the plate will be less worn.\" [Here is a very emphatic addition to the arguments of all those who have asserted or still assert that Palmer is not an etcher and that his plates are not etchings. He rejoices - and very prematurely as it happened - in the hope that, by some blessed miracle, the printer will give him proofs with the texture of old woodcuts! He had no desire whatever to be called a true etcher.] He proceeds:- \"I then did a good deal with the graver, but left the sky, and on July 3. (1858) Mr. Gad took 4 proofs during . . . punching up &c. Also two other proofs not wiped at all, or as he calls it wiped to the canvas; i.e. as far as the canvas wiping but not as far as the muslin wiping; and another wiped to the muslin, this last I think is a most excellent way of printing - acting on the etching as a glazing on the prepared picture and I think it will save a great deal of work, add mystery, and be my best plan for the future.\" \n\nApparently there was no particular reason for using the graver, for there had been no mischances. I take it as demonstrating that the principal object in all Palmer's work was the strong appeal of the subject to himself, and through himself, maybe, to others. Also to bring out certain qualities in that subject which revealed themselves in the first vision. He had a vehement and outspoken admiration for certain etchings which are widely dissimilar. Claude's for instance; Holman Hunt's <i>Desolation of Egypt</i>, of which he said, \"I entirely love it;\" <i>The Drudging Goblin</i>, by Townsend; and probably Rembrandt's portrait with cap and feather. It is scarcely to be supposed that he asked any questions as to how they were produced. He never, for three minutes together, tried to be what he was informed was a true etcher; nor would he have done so if he had been reduced to his last sixpence and his last plate. \n\nIn my father's commonplace-book there were many notes relating to the progress of other early plates, but not any which gives a better idea of his general method, than the account of <i>The Ploughman Going Home</i>. That and the equivalent <i>Tardus Bubulcus</i> are the original and proper titles of the plate. What he intended to represent was the ploughman with his yoke, weary and slow, catching the first glimpse of the little twinkling lattice among the chestnuts and oaks, where supper awaits him; and where in the great shadows cast by the moon, the oxen can chew the cud and rest. There is thus a sort of companionship with the Italian ploughman who begins his vigorous labour as the sun rises in a glorious flush of crimson and gold behind the solemn cypresses. The title <i>Herdsman</i> is nonsense, and destroys the significance of the plate, and its connection with Gray's <i>Elegy</i>, which was fully preserved by the Latin version; but as it has been generally used, and the print is familiar to dealers and to the public under that name, it must be allowed to stand. \n\nIn a note on page 330 of the 1876 edition of <i>Etching and Etchers</i>, Hamerton wrote:- \"The reader acquainted with technical matter will learn with some surprise that Mr. Palmer never once had recourse to re-biting. This only shows the remarkable skill with which he manages the acid - a skill the more remarkable that he had etched so few plates.\" In my father's commonplace-book, notes describing the re-biting of <i>The Ploughman Going Home</i> (in three bitings) were made. The date was September 1861. (See also note on re-biting of <i>The Early Ploughman</i>.)'\n<u>Catalogue of an Exhibition of Drawings, Etchings & Woodcuts by Samuel Palmer and other Disciples of William Blake October 20 - December 31, 1926</u>.

PALMER \n\nGenerally, this exhibition shows very clearly how, in Palmer\u2019s work, most careful analysis went hand in hand with most imaginative designing. If, in etching, he had tapped the great resources of his analytical knowledge and draughtsmanship, now and then (as for instance the magnificent and very ancient tree trunks of Lullingstone Park), I am inclined to think that he might have done etched work as much to Ruskin\u2019s satisfaction as the tree-drawing which Ruskin eulogises in <i>Modern Painters</i>. \nWith the public verdict of seventy-four years (although I have not seen a tenth part of it), I feel content, and more than content. It has been kindly to a very high degree, even when written by those whose sympathies were almost entirely with etching of a totally different school. It has been, so far as I know, unanimous both in the press and privately. Maybe, that some day Mr. Rossetti\u2019s prophecy will be fulfilled \u2013 namely, that the realistic side of Palmer\u2019s art \u201con which he touches the many,\u201d will cause his work to grow in influence. \nOne of the objects of this exhibition was to demonstrate that the purely realistic and analytical side of that art was, from the very first, closely allied with the purely imaginative \u2013 that he continually turned from one to the other \u2013 thus vindicating Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s words: \u201cIt will be found that the ingenious are always fanciful and the truly imaginative never otherwise than analytic.\u201d \nIn all Palmer\u2019s art-teaching, or in the examples he made for his pupils\u2019 use, there was not one attempt to inoculate them with those artistic ideals by which, if his name goes down to posterity, he will be known. But there was a ceaseless effort to emphasize the importance of that universally unpopular pair, \u201cElements and Accuracy.\u201d \nAlthough my father once wrote that the destruction of an etched plate seemed to him like \u201cthe murder of a mind,\u201d I have followed the best advice in Europe most generously given at the cost of much time and trouble, and all the plates in my possession have been finally cancelled by one of the usual methods. This is a fate far more merciful than that they should have been ultimately sold and condemned to the lingering death and dishonour which has befallen plates by illustrious hands. \nThree eminent artists and etchers have, out of regard for Samuel Palmer\u2019s work and memory, done that memory the honour to attend to the plates\u2019 obsequies. They have done this even to printing some of the final impressions with their own hands. In the whole of my father\u2019s life there was no such incident as this. The devotion of the \u201cAncients\u201d to each other was as nothing to it. For brevity\u2019s sake I gave to the three artists the name of \u201cThe Trio.\u201d When any future collector sees the little equilateral triangle which symbolizes the three etchers (and also their initials F. S., F. L. G. and M.H.,) on the margin of an etching by their fellow craftsman, he will know that of all the kindly things which have been written and done in connection with Samuel Palmer and his work, none approaches theirs.\n\n[\u2026] \n\nADDITIONAL NOTES. \n\n<i>General Note on the Etchings</i>. \u2013 Although some of the best impressions of his etchings were sold or given away by Samuel Palmer, nearly all those which I have contributed to this Exhibition were, for various reasons, among his especial treasures. They also represent many days of intense agony and \u201cgrated consciousness\u201d by the side of the inanimate and animate machines which he had to deal with. Of the various states I myself know little. For that knowledge \u201cThe Trio\u201d must be consulted. \u2013 A.H.P.'",
