            "public_access_description": "Oliver Messel's work covered all aspects of theatre design - drama, film, ballet, opera, revue - as well as interior design and decoration.  He also produced costumes for fancy dress and period balls, which were a feature of social life in the 1920s and 1930s.  This wreath may have been produced for such a ball, maybe the famous Chelsea Arts Ball, a famous, somewhat bohemian, annual event at which the guests vied with each other to wear the most extravagant or outrageous costumes.  A vine-leaf wreath, with its overtones of Roman banquets, would have been very much in keeping with the event. The leaves are made of leather, a material that Messel used a great deal, as it is light and can be moulded into complex shapes, which can then be painted to resemble metals or, as here, vegetation.\n\nOliver Messel (1904-1978) was Britain's leading theatre designer from the early 1930s to the mid 1950s, working in every aspect of entertainment - ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue - as well as in interior decoration and textile design.  His lavish, painterly and romantic designs informed by period styles, were perfectly in tune with his times and earned him an international reputation.  By 1960, however, Messel's style had become unfashionable, having no sympathy with the new 'kitchen sink' school of theatre.  He increasingly concentrated on non-theatrical painting and designing and eventually retired to the Caribbean, where he began a new career designing and building highly idiosyncratic luxury villas.",

However, a viewing of the film confirms that no such wreath was used, nor is there any obvious scene in which it might have been used.  It is as likely to have been made for a costume party.\nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's remaining designs and artefacts (many designs were sold or given away during the artist's lifetime).  The collection was briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being placed on indefinite loan to the V&A Theatre Museum from 1981.  The Oliver Messel Collection was purchased from Lord Snowdon in 2005 with the aid of the Heritage Lottery Fund, The Art Fund and the Friends of the V&A.",
