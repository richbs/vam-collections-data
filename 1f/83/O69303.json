It has a straight and rectangular shape and is sleeveless, with an oval neckline. It is lined with silk chiffon. Stitched inside the hem is 'Sac satin broch\u00e9 1911 No 30'.\n\nThe tunic was described as a robe de minute ('minute robe') because it took only half an hour to make. The prototype was made in 1908. Paul Poiret made this dress for his wife Denise, for their European Fashion Tour in 1911. She wore it for their visit to Berlin. Consisting of a pure, simple rectangle of white satin, it was the avant-garde prototype of the chemise dress of the 1920s, making its first appearance ten years before its time. Madame Poiret wore it with the Dufy printed coat (La Peise) and a single grey pearl at her neck.",
