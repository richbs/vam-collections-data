            "physical_description": "Painting, in opaque watercolour on paper, a well-dressed noble youth sits at ease on a rock by a small brook under a tree listening to a kneeling man who is singing from a book. The youth is dressed in a vibrant plain orange <i>jama</i> with golden lappets decorated in a crimson running pattern under his right arm.  He wears a short golden <i>patka</i> with bands of red and green decoration with black interlaced patterning at the ends.  He is bare footed with golden <i>paijama</i> decorated with a pattern of red flowers.  His dark hair is swept up into a red turban with black and gold bands.  He is wearing pearl earrings, a pearl necklace and a large pendant red gem with a pearl.  He holds a small golden book in his left be-ringed hand.\n      The singer is dressed in simple clothes with a white tunic, black cummerband over baggy brown trousers.  He has a beard and a drooping moustache.  He wears a loosely-wound red turban.  In his left hand he holds an open red-covered book.\nTwo yellow birds with red pointed beaks sit in the feathery-leafed tree which grows out of the rock, the form of which is painted in pink and brown washes with delicate green brushwork to indicate undergrowth.  The tree is shown against a sandy-brown background which rises up and merges into a blue sky with no clear horizon.\n      The painting is framed in pale brown paper decorated with a running stylised foliate design in gold between white, black and outer dark blue outlines.  The border design of lilies and poppies is similar to that in IS.48/3B-1956, which has a similar, but not exactly the same brown inner frame.  The margins of the page have strips of buff-coloured paper inscribed with a white line along the inner edge. An additional strip of pale brown paper has been stuck along the left hand edge of the page to act as a gutter for the album binding.",
