Engraved silver cases such as this were fashionable gifts in the 1930s, and the previous year his evidently proud mother gave him a silver note-pad holder similarly engraved with his roles at the Old Vic in the 1929-1930 season.\n\nJohn Gielgud was passionate about the theatre from a very early age, and was related on his mother's side to the legendary acting family the Terrys. His grandmother was the actress Kate Terry; the actresses Dame Ellen Terry and Marion Terry were his great-aunts, and the actor Fred Terry was his great-uncle. His father's family had no theatrical connections. They were immigrants from Lithuania and Poland, the name Gielgud deriving from Gielgaudskis, a village in Lithuania.",
