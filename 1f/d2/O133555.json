In preparation for a career in the Church, he was educated at a Jesuit college in Douai in northern France from 1771 until 1775, but on his return embarked upon a stage career, possibly influenced by the success of his elder sister, the great actress Sarah Siddons.\n\nJ.P. Kemble went on to become a stately, formal actor best-known for his interpretation of heavily dramatic roles including Hamlet, Brutus, Cato, Rolla and Coriolanus. He was never suited for comedy and it was said of him that even in his most convivial moods he was 'solemn and funereal'.  He managed both the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, and Covent Garden where he caused the Old Price Riots by raising the price of admission to pay for rebuilding after the fire of 1808. He made several important reforms at Drury Lane Theatre, both in management and in costumes and scenery, and controversially introduced spectacular shows there featuring live animals and aquatic effects. His years of management were not a financial success.  He died in Lausanne in 1823.",
