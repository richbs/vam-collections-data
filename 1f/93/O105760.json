It was made by the Geographers' A\u2013Z Map Company in about 1960.  \n\nThis stage of book production is known as a 'page patch-up'. The designer would take loose elements of text and images and assemble and reassemble them until he or she was completely satisfied.  hey would then be stuck down and the finished page handed to the printer. This process is less common now that books are designed using computers. The V&A has examples of original artwork from the Geographers' A\u2013Z Map Company spanning 50 years in the company's history.",
