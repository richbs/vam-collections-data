A heavy curtain is suspended from the canopy and hangs down behind the throne. The base is chamfered upwards at the back to fit on a sloping surface, and several pieces of wood have been fitted to the main plank of the sculpture and carved separately, such as the front of the canopy and the left arm of the throne. The Antwerp mark of a hand is stamped into the top of Jesse's head.",

This image of him was used from the 12th century. It takes its form from the Old Testament Book of Isaiah (11:1-2): '...out of his roots a flower shall spring'.  In earlier examples Jesse is shown lying down. Carvers regularly used the figure of Jesse in Antwerp altarpieces made from about 1500-1550. The Antwerp guild mark of a hand is stamped on the head of the figure of Jesse as a guarantee of good workmanship. He is normally shown in the sculpture on a raised shelf  at the back of the altar. Or he appears in the main part of Marian or Passion altarpieces. He is often flanked by standing prophets holding scrolls. The Tree of Jesse, with more prophets or the kings of Judah, spreads into the frame of the compartment above.",
