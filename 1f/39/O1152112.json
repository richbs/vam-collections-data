Norah Blaney and Gwen Farrar joined the production for its transfer to London's Winter Garden Theatre, opening on 14 April 1930.\n\nNorah Blaney and Gwen Farrar first worked together at the end of the First World War, entertaining the troops in Belgium and France with Lena Ashwell's concert party, with Norah Blaney as the pianist and Gwen Farrar as a cellist, performing with a constant flow of repartee. They appeared in leading London and variety theatres between about 1921 to 1924, as well as in the 1921 cabaret show Pot Luck! with Jack Hulbert and Beatrice Lillie; and the 1923 Andr\u00e9 Charlot revues Rats, starring Alfred Lester and Gertrude Lawrence, and Yes! at the Vaudeville Theatre, Strand, London. In May 1924 they opened in another Charlot revue, The Punch Bowl, at the Duke of York's Theatre, London, with Alfred Lester, Sonnie Hale and Hermione Baddeley. They worked independently in the late 1920s but came together in 1930 for this production. They made a farewell appearance at the London Palladium in February 1932 but worked together again briefly to entertain the troops during the Second World War before the death of Gwen Farrar in 1944.",
