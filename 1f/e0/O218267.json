Living as a virtual prisoner in his laboratory within the fortress of his master Augustus the Strong of Saxony,  B\u00f6ttger's painstaking experiments eventually paid off when he finally succeeded in making porcelain in about 1708.\n\nThe shapes of the earliest porcelain pieces are attributed to the court silversmith J.J. Irminger who also used similar relief decoration on his gold and silver work. The same type of decoration is found on the even earlier red stoneware pieces B\u00f6ttger developed prior to discovering the formula for making porcelain.\n\nThis type of mug or tankard was probably used for drinking beer rather than the tea and coffee we would mugs for today.",
