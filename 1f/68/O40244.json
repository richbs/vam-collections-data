The garment has a round neck with a Peter Pan collar and a square falling collar, both of white cotton, with an additional bib collar of black cotton between them at the front.  The front corners of the falling collar are machine-embroidered, one with a pair of leaves in dark green, the other with the words 'Comme une image' in yellow; the bib collar is cut out and machine embroidered at the edge in a design of dark green leaves and two yellow and orange roses.  The short sleeves are gathered into the circular yoke and each is finished with a cuff of white cotton.  The fullness of the garment is also gathered into the yoke, and finishes at the crotch with divided legs, each of which is finished with a cuff of white cotton which is elasticated at the back.  The garment fastens at the back of the yoke with two black plastic buttons and stitched buttonholes, and at the crotch/ legs with five metal pairs of press studs.",
