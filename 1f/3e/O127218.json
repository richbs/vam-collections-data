His work may be described as Symbolist and has much in common with that of figures such as Odilon Redon and Gustave Dor\u00e9, although Hieronymus Bosch, Giovanni Battista Piranesi and Francisco de Goya have also been cited as possible influences. \n\nBrandel\u2019s imagery often includes architecture, particularly Gothic cathedrals fantastically interpreted, with exaggerated and highly improbable structures, scale and perspective. This image appears to be taken from a viewpoint high up in the transept of a cathedral, looking down on the crossing.",
