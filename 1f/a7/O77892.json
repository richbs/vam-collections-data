Both front and back are finely painted with figure scenes, so the vases were probably intended to be seen from both sides or displayed in front of a mirror. 'Antique', or Neo-classical, vases like this were also kept in glazed cabinets and set out on ladies' dressing tables. A Derby auction catalogue of 1773 states that 'Antique' vases were 'particularly adapted for the Decoration of Chimney Pieces, Cabinets, Toilets. &c.' Small vases on pedestals were also set out on dining tables during the dessert course of grand meals, but these vases were usually unglazed.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe vases are rare examples of the Derby factory copying a Classical source. The figure subjects are derived from Pompeian wall paintings. Derby's immediate source for these was T. Martyn and J. Lettice's The Antiquities of Herculaneum (1773), to which William Duesbury (1725-1786), the owner of the factory, subscribed.\n\nTrading\nA London auction held by the Derby factory in 1778 included a pair of vases that were probably similar to these. They were described as 'One pair Etruscan vases enamel'd with Herculean figures, fine blue ground striped with gold' and realized \u00a33 13s 6d.  At that time, Chelsea and Derby modellers earned around \u00a32 11s. per week.",
