The following is the full text of the entry: ?PALOMBO,BARTOLOMEO (d. 1690) 775 Design for the decoration of a spandrel between two arches, with a pair of atlantes supporting a console Inscribed in pencil 'Bartolomeo Palombo. b.1612' Pen and ink and wash 11 3/4 x 12 1/8 (299 x 308) 8503.C PROVENANCE Bought 1879 The attribution to Palombo is uncertain, resting on the inscription, which is not old, but may record an old tradition. The identity of the artist Bartolomeo Palombi is also uncertain. An artist of this name is mentioned in Titi, Ammaestramento utile ... , Rome, 1686, and after him by other writers like Lanzi, Nagler etc. In Thieme-Becker the first name is given as Domenico, and Titi is stated to have been mistaken. The latest discussion of the question is in an article on the followers of Cortona in Rome by N. Wibiral in Bolletino d'Arte, series 4, 45, 1960, pp. 131-33. Here it is suggested that the real name of Titi's Bartolomeo Palombo was Bartolomeo Colombo and that the confusion arose through the similarity of sound and sense which exists between the two names. Colombo was a follower of Cortona who is known from the accounts to have worked in the Gallery of Alexander VII in the Qpirinal Palace. The drawing may well be by a follower of Cortona. Seven other drawings bought from the same dealer, not all at the same time, came to the Museum under the name of Palombi. The only two that might be by the same hand as no. 775, and might consequently be by Palombi are nos. 776 and 777, which were bought in the same batch. The other five appear to be later in date. They are nos. 1241-43, 1249 and 1263.",
