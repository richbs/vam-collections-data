The production starred Julie Andrews as Eliza Dolittle and Rex Harrison as Henry Higgins.\n\nThis bears a label for Margaret Halstan, who played the Queen throughout most of the London run for My Fair Lady. It differs in scaled from photographs of her in the role, but it is possible that she had more than one made in different weights.",
