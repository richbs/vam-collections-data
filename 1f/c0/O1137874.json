The Virgin and Child, with Saints.* Two of them are embracing in the foreground; the Virgin above, four other saints on each side, standing. A study for the picture in the Gallery of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, in which no saints are introduced in the foreground, but two angels are seated on the steps side by side, and the figure of St. Anne is represented standing behind the Virgin. The composition has been engraved by Giovanni Antonio Lorenzini. Black chalk on brown paper.  150 \n<i>Height,</i> 8 <i>inches. Width,</i> 6 5/12 <i>inches.</i> \n \n[* Another and more important study for this composition of the Virgin enthroned and surrounded by saints, is in the Cracherode Collection in the British Museum, and a third is on the Uffizi Gallery at Florence, which has only one saint on each side of the Virgin, and instead of the monks embracing in the foreground, a boy is seated, who is playing on the violin.]'\nWard-Jackson, Peter, <u>Italian Drawings. Volume I. 14th-16th century</u>, London, 1979, p. 36 The following is the full text of the entry: BARTOLOMMEO, FRA <i>known as</i> Baccio della Porta (1472-1517) 39 The Virgin and Child on a dais, within an apse, surrounded by saints, with St Francis and St Dominic embracing in the foreground Black chalk 8 x 6 1/8 (203 x 155) Dyce 150 PROVENANCE Dyce Bequest 1869 LITERATURE <i>Dyce Catalogue </i>no. 150 (as by Fra Bartolommeo); Reitlinger, p. 8, no. 10 (same attribution) There are three other versions of this design: (a) in the British Museum (Cracherode Collection, no. F.f.1-3; Photo. Gernsheim, no. 252; BB. 1938, no. 1817, where it is ascribed to Fra Paolino). (b) in the Uffizi (no. 408. Photo. Gernsheim, no. 2370; BB. 1938, no. 355, 'an early stage, perhaps, for the Louvre Marriage of St Catherine'). (c) in the Mus\u00e9e Wicar at Lille (Pluchart, <i>Mus\u00e9e Wicar</i>, no. 43; Photo. Gernsheim, no. 16673; BB. 1938, no. 398, 'sketch for the Louvre Marriage of St Catherine'). The connection between those four drawings and the Louvre Marriage of St Catherine is hardly close enough to justify Berenson's suggestion that two of them are sketches for the painting. The painting is illustrated in F. Knapp, <i>Fra Bartolommeo della Porta</i>, Halle, 1903, p. 103, pl. 49, and in H. von der Gabelentz, <i>Fra Bartolommeo</i>, Leipzig, 1922, 1, pl. 10. The <i>Dyce Catalogue</i> associates our drawing with the painting in the Uffizi showing the Virgin and Child with St Anne behind and above them (Knapp, <i>op. cit.,</i> p. 114, pl. 52). But here again there is no significant connection.",
