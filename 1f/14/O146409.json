The Roman Catholic congregation of the medieval period believed, as they still believe, that the wine was transformed into the blood of Christ during the ceremony of the Mass. By the early 14th century, it was usual  for only the priest to take both sacraments (bread and wine), while the lay congregation received just the bread. \n\nThe mark of crossed keys inside a circle, stamped upon the bowl and foot of this chalice, shows that it was made in the town of Avignon. The crossed-keys motif was used by the Papacy. The Papacy moved from Rome to Avignon in 1305 and remained there for around 70 years, the longest period that the Papal Curia resided outside  Rome. During this time successive French Popes ran the Papacy , and many of these Popes became renowned for surrounding themselves with luxurious objects including gold and silver.",

Hildburgh F.S.A\n\nHistorical significance: The mark of crossed keys inside a circle found upon the cup and foot of this chalice links it to work produced in Avignon. Ronald Lightbown argued that this mark was used by curial goldsmiths during the periods of the <i>sede vacante</i>, periods between the death of a Pope and the appointment of his sucessor when the Papal seat is vacant. Elisabeth Taburet-Delahaye refutes this suggestion, arguing that the mark may have been used at any time in the period of Pope Cl\u00e9ment V (1305-14), the following <i>sede vacante</i> (1314-16) or in the papacy of John XXII (1316-34). She suggests that the simple form and archaic style of this chalice may indicate that it is an example of silverware noted in the accounts of the Apostolic See which was given to poor churches.\n\nThe Papacy moved to Avignon in 1305 and remained there for around 70 years, the longest period that the Papal Curia has been away from Rome. During this time the Papacy was governed by successive French Popes, many of whom became renowned for surrounding themselves with luxurious objects including gold and silver.",

Chalices were often made of precious materials both to reflect the central importance of the ceremony, and that of the consecrated wine. The Roman Catholic congregation of the medieval period believed, as they still believe, that the wine was transformed into the blood of Christ during the ceremony of the Mass.",
