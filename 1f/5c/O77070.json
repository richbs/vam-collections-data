He specialised in genre scenes of children which were much admired. They were usually rather idyllic scenes like this.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nWhen this painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1851, The Art Journal in its review, admired the subject of `Children decking with flowers their little sister, whom they have drawn forth in her little cart; the picture has much truthful excellence.' Most early Victorian artists, with the notable exception of William Mulready, avoided the darker aspects of childhood in response to the taste of their patrons.",
