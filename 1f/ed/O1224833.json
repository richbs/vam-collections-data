It combines children's interest in imitating the domestic chores of adults with the intrigue of a puzzle. It was given to Caroline Egan in 1965 as a Christmas present from her parents.\n\nManufactured by the British toy producer, J & L Randall, it was one of the general toys that they marketed under the Merit line. The company flourished in the 1950s and 1960s, also making technical toys such as steam engines and microscopes, under the SEL brand. They were taken over by Letraset in the late 1970s, but the brand has since disappeared: many of their products have since become collector's items.",
