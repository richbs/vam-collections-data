It is unclear what this textile would have been used for, although it is likely to have had a decorative purpose. It was recovered from the site of Balawaste. \n\nThis was part of an area we now call  the Silk Road, a series of overland trade routes that crossed Asia from China to Europe. The most notable item traded was silk. Camels and horses were used as pack animals and merchants passed the goods from oasis to oasis. The Silk Road was also important for the exchange of ideas. Whilst silk textiles travelled west from China, Buddhism entered China from India in this way.\n\nThis textile was brought back from Central Asia by the explorer and archaeologist Sir Marc Aurel Stein (1862-1943). The V&A has around 650 ancient and medieval textiles recovered by Stein at the beginning of the 20th century. The textiles range in date from the 2nd century BC to the 12th century AD. Some are silk while others are made from the wool of a variety of different animals.",

Fragments of manuscripts, pottery, and plaster were found at this site but also fragments of mural paintings, probably from a Buddhist shrine. The site is dated to around 600 AD based on clothing and style of the divine beings in the paintings. A small clamp-resist dyed silk is in the V&A Stein collection.",
