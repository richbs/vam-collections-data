Around the neck of this tunic is a stiff gold band decorated with a central row of gilt medallions and linked to gold epaulettes with loops of bead trimmed gold cord.\n\nThis tunic was worn with white bell-shaped silk trousers, faced with linen and with a heavy gold lame waistband. Gold cord loops run from the centre front fastening and side seams to circle around the rear of the trousers. The base of the trouser legs have been stiffened with gold jersey set with gold braid and studs and are edged with gilt ball buttons.\n\nThe 'little gods' were played by children and the role involved compartively little movement, as is evidenced by the tall headdress which also formed part of their costume.",
