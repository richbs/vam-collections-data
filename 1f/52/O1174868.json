            "public_access_description": "Harrison Ainsworth's murder novel Jack Sheppard was the sensation of the day when it was first published in instalments in Bentley's Miscellany in 1839, and hacks at half a dozen theatres eagerly dramatised it even before the instalments were finished. The version at London's Adelphi theatre was by John Baldwin Buckstone who began writing plays in 1826 and wrote several rollicking melodramas for the Adelphi. His script for Jack Sheppard had the audience in tears nightly as Jack Sheppard lay sobbing on his mother's grave: 'They tell me she forgave me before she died - bless her! Oh, villain, outcast, condemned fellon that I am!'\n\nWith crowd-pleasers such as this, early Victorian theatre managers knew that more expensive pictorial posters such as this reaped dividends.A series of images such as this never failed to fascinate and attract patrons, including the many illiterate but avid theatre-goers who would have enjoyed not only Jack Shepard but the 'dramatic caricature' and the richly-costumed historical romance that rounded off the evening.",
