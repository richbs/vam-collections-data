In 1935 his son Charles Goldsmith entered the firm with the aim of making glasses a fashion item. From the company's offices in Poland Street, his sons A. Oliver and Ray Goldsmith built upon the company's reputation for attention-grabbing designs and solicited celebrity endorsement for their products. Key clients included Lord Snowdon, the actress Diana Dors, Princess Grace of Monaco and Diana, Princess of Wales. \n\nA. Oliver Goldsmith designed this frame in the 1960s when plastic for eyeglasses was still cut and shaped by hand. This is a variation on another Oliver Goldsmith style called 'Oo-er', which drew inspiration from the square shape of the 1960s television set. 'Fuz' is a simplified reference to that earlier design.",
