The public and most collectors of modern works started to prefer lighter and sometimes more sentimental themes.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThis painting is an illustration to John Milton's 1632 poem `Il Penseroso', an invocation to the goddess Melancholy, so that she might bring the poet a life of quiet study and meditation. `But hail, thou goddess, sage and holy, Hail, divinest Melancholy.'  Like the poem, it is a companion  to `L'Allegro', also described here.\n\nA contemporary critic spoke of this painting as `The most profoundly sentimental figure that the artist has ever painted.'\n\nPeople\nCharles West Cope (1811-1890)was a landscape watercolourist as well as an oil painter. He was a friend of the collector John Sheepshanks who gave nine of Cope's works to the Museum. Nearly all his paintings were literary, biblical or historical subjects and domestic genre. He studied fresco painting in Italy and painted several frescos in the Palace of Westminster.  Cope exhibited 134 works at the Royal Academy and in 1870 was appointed examiner in painting at the South Kensington Schools of Art, the forerunner of the Royal College of Art.",

Briefly at school in London, then Leeds Grammar School. Returned to London 1827 to study at Sass's art school and 1828 at RA Schools. Travelled to Paris 1832 and Italy 1833-5. Exhibited 134 works at the RA between 1833 and 1882, 14 at the BI 1836-43, and one at the SBA 1837. Nearly all his paintings were literary, biblical or historical subjects and domestic genre; the fact that he was Roman Catholic may explain his choice of many of the subjects. Founder member of the Etching Club in about 1840. Awarded one of the three first prizes in the 1843 competition for the new Palace of Westminster decorations with 'An Early Trial by Jury'; travelled again to Italy to study fresco painting before painting several frescos at Westminster. Elected ARA 1843, RA 1848; appointed Professor of Painting at the RA 1867, and examiner in painting for the South Kensington Schools of Art 1870. Visited America and Canada 1876. Died Bournemouth, Hampshire, 21 August 1890. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1869, ppl77-9; CH Cope <i>Reminiscences of Charles West Cope</i> RA 1891 (referred to below as <i>Reminiscences</i>) \n\n<b>Il Penseroso</b> \nFA59 Neg 54208 \nCanvas, 71.1 x 46.4 cm (28 x 18\u00bc ins) \nSigned and dated 'C W Cope/1848' bl (not 1847 as in the 1907 catalogue) \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nExhibited at the RA in 1848, and according to the <i>Reminiscences</i> sold to\nJohn Sheepshanks before the exhibition opened. The RA catalogue gives the title as 'From Il Penseroso', with lines 11-12 and 37-42 from Milton's 1632 poem: \n\nBut hail, thou goddess, sage and holy, \nHail, divinest Melancholy. \n\nCome, but keep thy wonted state, \nWith even step, and musing gait; \nAnd looks commercing with the skies, \nThy rapt soul sitting in thine eyes: \nThere, held in holy passion still, \nForget thyself to marble. \n\nThe poem is an invocation to the goddess Melancholy to bring the poet a life of quiet study and meditation. Like the poem, it is a companion to 'L'Allegro' (see FA58, p48, which is painted on panel). \n\nThe <i>Examiner</i> critic believed it 'seems to promise that time and study will impart to future compositions, as able in the mechanical details as his \"Wolsey\" [also exhibited at the 1848 RA], that imaginative sentiment in which the latter is deficient. His \"Allegro\", a good piece of painting, is not equal to the \"Penseroso\". Allegory has weakened it'. The <i>Art Union</i> thought it \n\nThe most profoundly sentimental figure that the artist has ever painted; it is a pendant to 'L' Allegro', but more successful. It is evening deepening twilight - and the figure is seen leaning on a tomb, having a book before her, from which she has raised her eyes, and looks upwards. This picture is a passage of true poetry, an embodiment of the spirit of the verse, which cannot be excelled in pathetic truth. \n\nCope exhibited a painting entitled 'Penserosa' at the RA in 1855; he also exhibited there 'Milton's Dream' in 1850. Subjects for the competitions for the decoration of the new Palace of Westminster in the 1840s included the life and work of Milton, along with Shakespeare, Spenser, and British history. For an extensive survey of the interpretation of Milton's works by English artists, and a list of lesser-known artists who exhibited Milton subjects 1820-50, see Pointon's book cited below. \n\nEXH: RA 1848 (262)\n \nLIT: <i>Examiner</i> 1848, p325; <i>Art Union</i> 1848, p170; Waagen <i>Treasures</i> 1854, Il, p303; M Pointon <i>Milton and English Art</i> 1970, p208\"",
