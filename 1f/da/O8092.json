            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nPunch pots were an invention of the mid-18th century, which followed exactly the form of contemporary Staffordshire teapots.\n\nOwnership & Use\nUnlike punch bowls, included in pictures of riotous parties and their attendant paraphernalia, no contemporary illustrations exist of punch pots in use.The main ingredients of punch are spirits, sugar, nutmeg, spices and water. It can be assumed that punch pots were invented as a more refined means of dealing with this hot alcoholic beverage.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe invention of the punch pot was surely closely linked with the introduction of red stoneware teapots in Staffordshire about 1750.These teapots, which were favoured by the Chinese for their ability to withstand the flame of a spirit-lamp, were ideal for making punch and keeping it hot. The same characteristics were shared with Staffordshire white salt-glazed stoneware, which in turn could be changed from a utilitarian object to a luxury product by the addition of elaborate enamel decoration. This pot has been decorated by one of the talented but anonymous independent decorators whose idiosyncratic style may be recognised on porcelain and opaque-white glass of the period.",
