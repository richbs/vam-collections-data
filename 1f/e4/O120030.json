In his native Germany he developed an interest in Dada and Surrealism and in Bauhaus artists such as Paul Klee. He moved to London from Hamburg in the early 1930s with his brother Bill (1904\u201383), who became famous as a photographer.\n\nThis is one of nine illustrations that Brandt made for the children\u2019s book The Story of a Tree by Stephen McFarlane. Charting the passage of a tree from forest to sawmill to carpenter\u2019s workshop to toyshop, the images are a charming example of illustration for children at the end of the Second World War. Brandt\u2019s interest in Surrealism is evident in some of the illustrations, especially the cover page, where the trees take on the forms of furniture and toys.",
