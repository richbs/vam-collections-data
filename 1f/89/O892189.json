The picture on the easel is of a female nude. The costume is of a type that was fashionable in the latter part of the 16th century. Two portrait drawings by Agostino Carracci, dated 1590, at Windsor Castle show a similar kind of dress (Wittkower, Windsor, pls. 27 and 28). Such clothes would have been very old-fashioned by 1616, when Guercino was twenty-five. It is unlikely therefore that a drawing that must be dated so early is by a pupil. Being in Guercino's manner, it must be by Guercino himself or a good copy of a drawing by him. It is not a self portrait. Ottavio Leoni's engraved portrait of him, dated 1623, shows a different face (Bartsch, 17, no. 18). Possibly a copy by Guercino or a pupil of a self portrait by another artist.",
