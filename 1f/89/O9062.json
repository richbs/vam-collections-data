The original eyes have been removed and brown wool stitching put in their place. There are the remains of five claws stitched with brown wool on the feet and arms. The nose stitching is almost completely missing and the muzzle is worn. The head has been restitched onto the body. The stuffing in the body is somewhat mishapen and the card squeaker inside has shifted position to the right. The front seam appears to have been unpicked and stitched up again but not recently.",
