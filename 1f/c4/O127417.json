Brunias was born in Rome in 1730. Whilst working in England for the architect Robert Adam as a draughtsman and decorative artist, Brunias met William Young who, in 1764, was nominated the first Commissioner and Receiver for sale of lands in the ceded (from France) West Indies islands of Dominica, St Vincent, Grenada and Tobago. Brunias agreed to accompany Young to the West Indies as his personal artist.\n\nBrunias spent seven years in the West Indies creating romantic genre scenes of markets, village and harbour scenes. Brunias\u2019s treatment of his human subjects reflects that of artists recording natural history specimens: every aspect of dress and accessory is captured in exhaustive detail yet the figures appear as \u2018types\u2019 rather than individuals. Dress is used as the marker of particular colonial identities encountered on the islands: Carib, Black Carib, mulatto, slave, freedman, and planter. Brunias\u2019s romanticised images of island life, which denied the harsh realities of plantation slavery, were popular with members of the white plantocracy, both in the West Indies and in Britain. This image is an engraved copy by the French artist Louis Charles Ruotte.",
