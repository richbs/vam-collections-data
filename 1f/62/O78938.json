The top block was raised and food put in, to tempt the mouse into the trap. When the mouse went in and pressed down a balance in the centre of the bottom board, the heavy block fell down and killed it.  Later mouse traps worked with metal springs.\n\nOwnership & Use\nThis mouse trap was probably made between 1800 and 1850.  It was bought by the Museum  in 1934  from a collector of early oak furniture.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe mouse trap is made of pine, a relatively cheap wood which is easy to cut and shape.  Few such mouse traps survive today as most were worn out and thrown away.",
