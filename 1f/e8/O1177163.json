            "public_access_description": "Rainbow Sound Blocks were made in 2005 by Wonderworld, a company that designs and manufactures educational and environmentally-friendly wooden toys. The blocks are made from rubberwood, which comes from a sustainable source in Thailand. The rubber tree is primarily used for the production of latex. In the past, when the supply of latex was exhausted the tree was often burnt and the wood went to waste.\n\nWooden blocks are an enduring nursery toy. They help to develop motor skills and hand-eye coordination. These blocks also encourage learning and creativity through the use of different sounds, colours, and weights. Each block contains different sized beads made from wood or plastic. These rattle when the block is shaken. The Rainbow Sound Blocks have won several awards including the Silver Practical Pre-School Award in 2006 and a National Parenting Publications Award in 2001.",
