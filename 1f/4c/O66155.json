He was a pupil and assistant to R.J Wyatt and was also taught by John Gibson.\n\nBenjamin Evans Spence (Liverpool 1822- Rome 1866) was the son of the sculptor William Spence (1793-1849). It was formerly thought that Spence's middle name was Edward, but Timothy Stevens has ascertained that it is Evans. Spence was a sculptor and attended the Liverpool Academy Schools in 1838. In 1846 he travelled to Rome, initially to work in the Studio of John Gibson, later that of Richard James Wyatt (1795-1850). On the death of Wyatt, Spence completed all his unfinished works and took over the studio. He remained in Rome all the rest of his life, just to travel to England about once a year to the Royal Academy exhibitions. He set up his independent studio in 1848 in the Via degli Incurabili in Rome.",
