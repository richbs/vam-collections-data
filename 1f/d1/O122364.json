            "public_access_description": "Benedetto Buglioni is said to have learned the art of enamelled terracotta from a woman employed in Andrea della Robbia's house. He appears to have worked in Florence at the same time as Andrea, but the products of his workshop are considered both technically and artistically inferior. The saint is shown with one of his attributes, a pig, an animal bred by the Antonine monks.\n\nSaint Anthony was an early Christian saint and hermit, born in upper Egypt. He is regarded as one of the founders of monasticism. He is normally represented holding a stick with a tau-shaped handle like a crutch and a bell.",
