Its large and fashionable clientele included the 2nd Duke and Duchess of Sutherland, to whom the company supplied a table with swans and lotus leaves for Stafford House (now Lancaster House), London, in 1838. The firm's display at the Great Exhibition of 1851 included tables with storks and with swans, the latter apparently designed by the Duchess. The Chevalier, or Cavaliere, Michelangelo Barberi, who exhibited his micro-mosaic work at the Exhibition, supplied a table top for Arundel Castle, West Sussex, in 1847, which is very similar to this example.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe technique of moulding leather to create floral swags, frames and friezes was popular with professionals and amateurs in the 1850s. Wet sheets of leather, either goat, calf, or sheepskin, were cut to shape, using paper patterns. The leather could be stamped or incised to create areas of shallow patterning. Stems were made by rolling strips of wet leather around wires, while flowers and leaves were moulded by hand and then glued to the stems. The leather decoration on this table was then gilded.",
