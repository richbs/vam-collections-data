They made 'nipple-type' jugs decorated in brown, green and red over a white ground. The white ground covers only the upper part and this is separated by a number of lines running round the belly. There is a jug illustrated in Hungarian Pottery (see Refs.) from this region of the same form as C.839-1917 but with different decoration. This jug is dated to the second half of the 19th century.",
