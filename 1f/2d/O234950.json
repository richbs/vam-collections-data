The design has a gourd brocaded in blue with markered carbon resist, the outline and ribbons probably templated. The small amount of careful red and yellow overglaze may be contemporary: not beyond the abilities of the time, but a demonstration of manual dexterity. The contrast in brilliance suggested the idea that these were 19th C. The rather deep shape is made possible for a flat stencil paper by confining the design to a central strip (KoNab, Fig 1n).\n\nPublished in Finch KoNab, col fig and figs 3g, 9p, and sections 1,4c and 1,3; F4. A brother dish is published in Iro Nabeshima, 1965, Asahi Shimban, and in Nabeshima, Kyushu Ceramic Museum, 2006 No 33, assessed as KoNabeshima but dated to the 17th C. The footring, with blades design, sequenced by Seki, dates it (see KoNab section III H2) as 1736- 41 (KoNab fig 6b).\n\nRelevance to history.\nThis rare dish is important firstly as demonstrating the very existence of KoNabeshima as a developmental stage, when important dealers and others in Japan, as late as 1997, were telling curators like Impey (TOCS 64) that there was no developmental KoNabeshima stage, only the Classical, arising fully developed; with Classical pieces assessed as 17th and 18th C, by using the now discredited ash layers method (See Finch, Tenkei and V&A willow plates no?).\n\nFew KoNabeshima plates were made and very few survive, mostly published by Seki (KoNabeshima 1996). There are very few indeed in the West, two in the UK ( KoNab fig 6b), and this is the earliest in the Western world.\n\nKoNabeshima can easily be distinguished from Classical Nabeshima because in general the back has continuous scrolling (difficult for the markering technique used on Classical backs), and the footring decoration varies but is not of the comb type. There are a few examples in between at the start of the Horeki period, starting 1751, with comb foot and scrolled back, and continuous scrolling was also revived very late in the 19th C.\n\nFailure to recognise the existence of KoNabeshima means that Classical dishes, far more common, and often dated too early by ash layers, can be sold and collected as 17th C Nabeshima.",
