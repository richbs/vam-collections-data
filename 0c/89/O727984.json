The concept behind the frescoes was that the six artists - Charles West Cope, George Frederick Watts, John Callcott Horsley, John Rogers Herbert, John Tenniel and Edward Armitage - could gain experience and learn about the technique of fresco painting. Within a year, it was clear that the paintings were deteoriating, and by the 1890s they had been hidden behind wooden panelling to protect them. In the 1980s the frescoes were restored and conserved and can once again be seen in the Hall.",
