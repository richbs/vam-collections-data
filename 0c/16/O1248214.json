As well as being crucial records of  the history of the V&A, and an  important element within the  National Art Library's visual encyclopaedia, these photographs are also significant artefacts in the history of the art of photography.\n\nIsabel Cowper was the sister of the  South Kensington Museum's first official photographer, Charles Thurston Thompson (1816-1868)  and of the Superintendent of the  Museum, Richard A. Thompson. Little is known about Cowper, but in her letter of resignation in 1891, she refers to herself as the Museum's 'Official Photographer', having taken up the position after the death of her brother. As such, she is an important part of the early history of  V&A and a seminal figure behind the Museum\u2019s early uptake of photography to document the arts.",
