The remade pieces are in pristine unworn condition and contain 1973 labels, whilst this dress is unlabelled, shows signs of having been worn, and could very well be from Mary Quant's personal wardrobe, as several photographs exist of her wearing this design. For example, a photograph of Quant in her design studio wearing this dress is published on page 10 of <u>Radical Rags: Fashion of the Sixties</u> by Joel Lobenthal. She is not wearing the co-ordinating bonnet or stockings.\n\nAnother photograph taken on 29 October 1964 by an Evening Standard photographer and held in the Hulton Archive collection, is viewable on the Getty Images database (reference number #3366283). It shows a full length shot of Mary Quant (wearing the dress and belt but not the associated accessories), the hairdresser Vidal Sassoon, and Sundra Mundy sitting in a pub.\n- Daniel Milford-Cottam (2011)",
