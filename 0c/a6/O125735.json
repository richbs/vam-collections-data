It depicts a young boy looking right, wearing a flat bonnet and a humble linen jacket. This boy was probably a member of the fishing community in Venice, which Blaas represented in several portraits and everyday genre scenes. \nA very similar painting, showing a young boy with a similar outfit looking left was sold at Christie's New York, 30 Oct 2002, lot 161. The use of an earthen palette with a free brushwork combined with a genre piece is reminiscent of the French Realist movement and the Florentine Macchiaoli group who developed a greater naturalism and favoured rustic subject matters.\nThe V&A painting escaped the attention of Thomas Wassibauer, author of the 2005 catalogue raisonn\u00e9 on von Blaas, but it however corresponds perfectly to the author description of the artist's ability to paint figures: \"the artist's infinite skill showing glorious flesh tones [used] a technique Eugen learned from his father Karl. In his autobiography, Karl von Blaas describes how he studied Titian's technique and learned to build up flesh colours using different glazes in order to produce a natural and three-dimensional effect...\" (T. Wassibauer,  <i>Eugen von Blaas 1843-1931</i>, Hildesheim, 2005.  pp. 16-17).",
