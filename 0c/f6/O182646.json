There is a single blue thread forming a line along the top and bottom of the upper border and along the inner edge of the side borders, but not along the bottom.  The central area has a directional design with a large triangular blossom of vertical stems in 2 shades of pink, faded mauve and light yellow on a main green stem with2 downward pointing leaf-like motifs in the same colours below it.  On the left hand motif there is a red and yellow flower emerging from its top right; on the others there is also one from the top left.
