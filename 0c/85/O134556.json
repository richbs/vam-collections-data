Studied with his maternal uncle W F Witherington RA and at the RA Schools. Exhibited 50 works at the RA between 1839 and 1875, and six at the BI 1841--47. Subjects were mythological, biblical and literary (especially Shakespeare and Spenser), and influenced primarily by Etty. Won prizes in the Westminster Hall competitions 1843 and 1847. Elected ARA 1847 (at a very young age), RA 1857, Keeper 1873. Retired 1888 and moved to Yarmouth, Isle of Wight, where he died 20 December 1900. His cousin Henry Hall Pickersgill (see entry below) and uncle Henry William Pickersgill RA were also artists. \nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1850, p108, 1855, pp233-6 \n\nThe Industrial Arts in Time of Peace \n127-1885 Neg GD1298 \nCanvas, 108.3 X 244.2 cm (42? X 96 ? ins) Transferred to the Department 1885 \nThe design for a lunette fresco for the South Court of the Museum, which was not executed. A full-size (198.2 X 457.2 cm/78 X 180 ins) design in crayon on paper is also in the collections (128-1885). The commission was given in 1871, at an agreed fee of \u00a31000, of which \u00a3500 was paid in advance for the design, and payment of \u00a34 a day to superintend its enlargement in fresco by students. These payments were agreed in writing in December 1872. The present design was exhibited in the South Court. \nThe project for the South Court began in 1863, when a design for a mosaic to fill one of the two large lunettes on the north wall was commissioned from G F Watts; the Court was extended to the south in 1869 and resulted in two matching lunettes at that end. The mosaic scheme was abandoned in favour of fresco, and in 1868 Lord Leighton was commissioned to design 'The Industrial Arts as Applied to War'. His subsequent 'The Industrial Arts as Applied to Peace', completed in 1880, presumably replaced Pickersgill's design. Leighton's work is more populated, and the setting deeper and more elaborate. Pickersgill did complete one of the 'Kensington Valhalla' panels (see p228). \nThe subject of Pickersgill's painting is more particularised than that of Leighton's executed design. A prince, his consort, and members of his court, seem to be visiting a medieval hall and inspecting the design for the frescoes which are in progress on the back wall. Monks (whose predominance suggests Peace) queue up to present their examples of fine workmanship such as book-binding and illumination, and wood-carving. On the left craftsmen inspect pieces of stained glass and decorative metalwork, while on the right women are engaged in embroidery and monks carve wood, both groups inspired by the branch of ivy in the jug. \nLIT: \tR Ormond Leighton's Frescoes 1975, p2; J Physick The Victoria and Albert Museum: the history of its building 1982, p73, repr in colour pl VIII, facing p49 \n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
