The decorative gadrooning on the body and lid was a popular Neo-classical motif and the shoulder is enriched with an applied silver band and engraved with a floral scroll. \n\nCoffee first appeared in England in about 1650. Within a short space of time there were approximately 400 coffee houses in London alone. The coffee pot came in many shapes and styles, but by about the 1790s, when this piece was made, vase- or urn-shaped coffee pots became increasingly fashionable. \n\nCoffee pots in the Neo-classical taste followed the vase-shaped form. They were popular in both silver and, like this piece, in the less expensive option of Sheffield plate (a thin layer of silver fused to a copper core).",
