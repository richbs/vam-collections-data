            "public_access_description": "Design for an embroidered apron, featuring heartsease, also known as 'wild pansy', by Sarah Bland (1810-1905) about 1836-1854.  Bland may have traced this design from a commercially available pattern from a magazine such as The Lady's Newspaper. On the other hand, she did botanical illustration to an exceptionally high standard and may have created this pattern from her own record of the heartsease plant and adapted it into a pattern for embroidery.  She annotated the design 'For Embroidered Apron, in coloured Silks.' The heartsease flower was to be embroidered after nature in 'violet' and 'yellow'. An example of one of Bland's botanical illustrations of two species of convolvuus that she intended to use for embroidery is E.372.81-1967.  \n\nThis design for an apron is in an album which includes Bland's collection of  her own botanically accurate designs, simplified patterns from accurate botanical observation, patterns traced from magazines, commercial, printed Berlin wool work patterns, gifts of patterns, including commercial ones from friends and relatives. The designs include those for petit-point, bead-work, decoration for dresses, collars and cuffs, aprons, slippers, tablecloths and covers, cushions, bags, penwipers, initial letters, alphabets etc. In Bland's case, the gift of designs demonstrates connections between relatives of merchant and banking families and is of historical significance in bonding such families.",

Women's amateur as opposed to professional designs for embroidery raise problems because amateur work has tended to be regarded as less significant. Embroidery was a pastime but was also an economic activity. Upper middle class women's property was closely linked to their status within the family as daughters, wives and widows and only allowed semi-independence. This semi-independence was underpinned by legal, political, and social practices which subordinated them. Nevertheless, it was combined with recognition of their economic worth within the family enterprise. However, women were restricted as they often could not be openly involved in working for money. See L. Davidoff and C. Hall (Reference Tab). Bland could not be seen to be working but it is likely that she embroidered accessories for dress, penwipers, tablecloths, book covers, and cushions as gifts which were her contribution to the household, wider family, and friendship. The quality of her samplers and designs shows the value of such gifts in terms of relationships with family and friends.\n\nMaterial about the perceptions of a woman's role is pertinent to the discourse on women and therefore gender history. In Bland's case, the gift of designs demonstrates connections between relatives of merchant and banking families and is of historical significance in bonding between such families.",
