The ground is worked with orange thread to form scale-like quilting. There is an inner and outer border with a green meander, green leaves and a red trefoil flower outlined in green.\nThere is a lobed roundel in the centre formed by a green band.  It contains a red circle with white central marking.  This is enclosed within an 8-pointed green star which links 4 green and red trees and 4 small carnation sprigs. There are other small red flowers attached to the stem and also isolated sprigs with 3 red flowers.\nA quarter of the roundel is in each corner. \nThe rest of the ground is decorated with scattered carnation sprigs which are upright in the lower half, and downward pointing in the upper half. The ground is quilted in a scale pattern.\nThree leaf-like motifs in the lower part are crudely worked with metal thread couched with green silk; there is also some metal thread at the top of the lowermost tree in the roundel.\nThreads: red, green and orange.\nMetal Thread: silver and gold metal strip [plate].\nBacking: white ground with a small red flower and leaves; probably European.\nFacing: bias cut striped silk, dark red with yellow.",
