The blade is grasped by a split boss, triangular on top and a rounded V underneath, and fastened by three 18 carat gold screws.

In the mythical marine scene depicted, a mermaid rises from ocean depths and blows fish up the handle. Short has deftly captured the depth and lustre of the colours. The enamelling uses the basse taille technique over the engraving, beautifully integrated with the surrounding silver. The swirling waves of the engraved silver complement the marine motif and create a luxuriant, opulent feel, enhanced by the split boss fastened by three 18 carat gold screws. The piece is a successful fusion between modern design and a highly decorative classical style.",
