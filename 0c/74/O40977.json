Many of his designs are in the Taylorian Institute in Oxford, and one of these, with a medallion portrait, bears a close resemblance to this monument. He was the son of a master mason and monumental sculptor Robert Taylor. At the age of eighteen Robert Taylor junior was apprenticed to Henry Cheere, and following that he travelled to Rome to study. Following his father's death he got financial help from friends of his father, the Godfrey family of Woodford, which allowed him to set up business as sculptor. His most famous commissions were the sculpture in the pediment of the Mansion House of 1744, and the monument to Captain James Cornewall in Westminster Abbey of 1755. After about 1755 he concentrated more on his architectural practice.",
