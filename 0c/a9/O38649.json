The certificate is of landscape proportions, with a white border, and is illustrated with characters from nursery rhymes and children's fiction as well as birds, insects and animals, all depicted gathered together on a woodland bank by a pool.  The title \"B.B.C. CHILDREN'S HOUR\" is printed across the top with the first three letters in gold and black and the remainder in royal blue; contained within the illustration is a rustic-bordered white panel printed in royal blue with the words \n\"THE BRITISH BROADCASTING CORPORATION\n.............................Edwin Chapman.............................  (inscribed in ink)\nhas been successful in four competitions\".\nThe natural (as opposed to anthropomorphic) creatures are probably a reference to the popularity of the Children's Hour nature broadcasts (notably those of the Reverend G Bramwell Evens, better known as \"Romany\") and include non-native as well as native species.  The fictional characters include those from Lewis Carroll's \"Alice\" books, Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", Kenneth Grahame's \"The Reluctant Dragon\", and S G Hulme Beaman's \"Tales of Toytown\".  The voice of Larry the Lamb in the broadcasts of the last-named was provided by Derek McCullough (\"Uncle Mac\")(1897-1967), presenter of  the request show \"Children's Favourites\", and the BBC's best-known Head of Children's Broadcasting, who has signed the certificate on a scroll drawn beneath an illustration of Larry.",
