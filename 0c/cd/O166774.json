It represents Ceres seated and is made of ivory and bronze, set on a red mottled marble stand. The form of the face and the pose of the figure recall ancient Roman sculpture; the style of the piece as a whole is redolent of the classicising tradition prevailing in France in the 1870s. Although contemporary records state that the piece was shown in the Annual International Exhibition held in London in 1871, it is not listed in the exhibition catalogue. However it is likely to have been shown there, and was probably purchased by the Museum direct from the exhibitor, Deni\u00e8re, who must also have been the manufacturer of this object. \nIn Greek mythology Ceres was the goddess of agriculture, especially associated with corn. She was often worshipped as the earth-mother, the prime source for fertility.",
