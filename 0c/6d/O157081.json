This service is remarkable as it contains nine pieces; the muffin dishes and the tea caddy are unusual additions. The only other large service known from this period was also by Paul Storr and was made for Earl Howe, it numbered thirteen original pieces and three later additions. \n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.\nOn long-term loan to Los Angeles County Museum from 2010.",
