The sage Narada, who carries a 'vina', ascends the stylized slopes of Kailasha, teeming with animal life, to where the Goddess sits with Ganesha on her lap in a building resembling a neo-classical mansion. In the courtyard in front her lion-vehicle (here recalling the heraldic British lion) crouches near a small temple with sloping 'bangla' roof. On the right Shiva sits beneath a tree with river Ganges descending from his top-knot. Ramdhan Svarnakar of Simulia is one of a number of craftsmen mentioned by Mildred Archer as having been active in the 1860's and 70's. \nSee (M. Archer [1977] pp.161 and 164).",

This particular print including several others from woodcut were given to the Museum by Mrs F.C. Foster, daughter of Dr Campbell, in 1923.\n\nLike Kalighat paintings the subject matter of the woodcuts was mainly religious. Numerous pamphlets and small books could also be bought at a low cost illustrated with woodcuts. Little is known about these woodcuts and the craftsmen who made them. The woodcuts were certainly being made in large quantities by 1860's. The majority of the engravers were living in North Calcutta, areas such as Ahiritola, Shobhabazar, Kombuleetola, Simulia and Bottala. Various shops in the area acted as agents for the craftsmen and sold their work for them. The artist of this particular woodcut, Ramdhan Svarnakar would have been a member of the goldsmith caste. No doubt he used his knowledge of gold engraving and adopted his craft on woodcuts. Several other craftsmen in this field also came from the goldsmith caste.",
