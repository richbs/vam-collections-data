            "public_access_description": "This example of rock and pop merchandise takes the form of a scarf, a popular form of expressing your admiration for a particular pop star or band in the early to mid 1970s. Made of nylon, it wasn't made to be worn, but rather to be held up outstretched in the audience so that the band could see your adoration. This fashion came from the British phenomenon of having a scarf in your supported team's colours, and holding it up on the football terraces.\n\nElton John is one of popular music's enduring icons. Having started his career performing in pubs from the age of 15, he worked his way up the music industry ladder by playing in bands with his friends, eventually becoming a staff songwriter for DJM Records. On gaining a record contract in 1970, at the age of 23, his live performance became bigger and more flamboyant. Backed by a large catalogue of ballads and piano rock, his scintillating stage shows involved him performing in wild costumes. Since the 1990s he has written several musicals, for the West End and for Disney animation.",
