These included brightly coloured slipwares from Bukhara, Samarkand and Rishtan, as well as white-glazed wares, painted in blue and purple, from Kokand.\n\nThere is no evidence that these wares were made in continuation of an earlier local tradition. They are frequently found in Western collections, and it is likely that the West was an important market. So, although this appears to be traditional \"peasant\" pottery made by and for local communities, it may actually be a conscious attempt to capitalise on the desire for such traditional goods among modern consumers.",
