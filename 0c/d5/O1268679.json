The back of each glove shows a patchwork design of 3x3 squares. Each finger has a different colour: yellow, blue, pail pink, soft turquoise and red. The palm of each glove is fuchsia pink, the band around each wrist is bright red. \n\nIn addition to the pair of multi-coloured angora gloves is a plain red angora beret (T.62-2013) which was also made to go with the 'Romany' cardigan for the 'Club to Catwalk' display. \n\nThe renowned knitwear designer Patricia Roberts is considered to be the first British designer to elevate hand knitting to the realms of high fashion. She was at the forefront of the hand-knitting revolution that took hold in the 1970s and early 1980s, and her hugely popular pattern books has inspired many hand knitters. Roberts is known for her bold, lively and innovative designs that employ luxurious (and often multi-textured) yarns.",
