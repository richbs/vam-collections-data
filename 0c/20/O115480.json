This decorative technique was used for small luxury items such as snuff boxes and jewellery. \n\nThe tortoiseshell usually came from the hawksbill (caret) turtle. It was softened in boiling salted water before being moulded in heated dies . Two main decorative effects were used. In piqu\u00e9 pos\u00e9, the pattern was engraved into the surface and filled with flakes or threads of precious metal. In piqu\u00e9 point, gold pins were inserted to form the design. All the objects in this case are formed by piqu\u00e9 pos\u00e9. \n\nPiqu\u00e9 was traditionally a French and Italian speciality . By the 1760s it had spread to England, where it was mass produced by Birmingham manufacturers from the 1870s.",
