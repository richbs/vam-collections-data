Christ, with a forked beard, is shown standing left of centre; from his right hand, raised in blessing, a short scroll rises. He looks right at the bearded Judas, who embraces him with his left hand, which is thrust under Christ's cloak. A soldier wearing armour, a tippet of mail, a helmet and gauntlets, rests a battle-axe with a long sweeping blade on his left shoulder. With his right hand he grasps Christ's cloak. Another helmeted soldier stands on the right of the panel, his right hand holding the hilt of his sword. The bearded St. Peter, looking downwards and away from Christ, stands on the left of the panel. He wears a cloak and appears to be in the act of drawing his sword from his scabbard with his right hand. \n\nThe whole of the bottom of the panel is missing. The top edge has been cut away behind the heads of the figures. No colour survives except for the slightest trace of gilding on the hair of Christ and St. Peter. The back of the panel bears two lead-plugged holes. There is the mark of the large cross with two slanting parallel lines in the right-hand lower angle.",

Christ, with a forked beard, is shown standing left of centre; from his right hand, raised in blessing, a short scroll rises. He looks right at the bearded Judas, who embraces him with his left hand, which is thrust under Christ's cloak. A soldier wearing armour, a tippet of mail, a helmet and gauntlets, rests a battle-axe with a long sweeping blade on his left shoulder. With his right hand he grasps Christ's cloak. Another helmeted soldier stands on the right of the panel, his right hand holding the hilt of his sword. The bearded St. Peter, looking downwards and away from Christ, stands on the left of the panel. He wears a cloak and appears to be in the act of drawing his sword from his scabbard with his right hand. \n\nThe whole of the bottom of the panel is missing. The top edge has been cut away behind the heads of the figures. No colour survives except for the slightest trace of gilding on the hair of Christ and St. Peter. The back of the panel bears two lead-plugged holes. There is the mark of the large cross with two slanting parallel lines in the right-hand lower angle.",
