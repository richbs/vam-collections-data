On her left hand is also a penannular bracelet with flat square terminals arranged as lozenges, a type commonly seen in south India. A more elaborate form of this type of bracelet is Museum number 1014-1872 and the type can also be seen in an album from Thanjavur dating from about 1830 (IS.39-1987). Her earlobes are distended to accommodate large, circular ear ornaments, which are pierced in the centre. The legs are thrust bent before her in balance to the motion of the swing. The right hand makes the 'kataka' hasta and the left the varada-hasta (?). In the  wavy hair  are the symbols of the  Sun and the Moon, together with a central forehead jewel on the hairline, in the South Indian jewellery style. The figure has been described as that of Trishala, the mother of the 24th Jain Tirthankara, Mahvira. The figure may however be Hindu. It has been proposed that it may represent Paravai, consort of the south Indian Shaivite saint Sundararmurti.\nA companion piece, IM.123-1924, has one or possibly two Tamil characters incised on the back.",
