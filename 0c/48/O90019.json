He was born in Hamburg, of an English-born father and German mother, and spent part of his youth in a sanatorium in Switzerland, under treatment for tuberculosis. In 1927-8 he underwent psychoanalysis, for the same illness, in Vienna. Here he assisted in a portrait studio and began his photographic career. He also met Eva Boros, who was to become his first wife. In 1930 he worked for Man Ray in Paris. He and Eva travelled together to Hungary, Hamburg, Paris, Madrid and Barcelona before settling in London in 1934. \n\nEva compiled two albums, chronicling her life with Bill Brandt, his brother Rolf and their close friends. They contain over 400 photographs (gelatin-silver prints), mostly by Brandt, and are assembled somewhat in the style of the new, illustrated photo-magazines of the time. Twelve pages are shown here. Together they illuminate Bill Brandt\u2019s biography and his development as a photographer. In them we see Brandt trying out different photographic ideas and subjects. Some of the photographs were subsequently published in Brandt\u2019s books and have become classics."

It illustrates Brandt's early photographic career in Vienna, Hungary, Hamburg, Paris, Barcelona, Madrid and London.  In addition to being of primary importance to Brandt's biography, the album illustrates many of the major themes of his oeuvre, such as night life in the St. Paul's district of Hamburg, everyday scenes in Paris and, most importantly, the subject matter of his first two books, 'The English at Home' (1936) and 'A Night in London' (1938).  Many key works are included here in what must be their earliest versions, as relatively small prints (often contact prints).  In addition, these are illuminating photographs that have so far not been published, such as a view of Brandt's bedroom in Paris in 1933, which includes the Surrealist journal 'Varietes'.",
