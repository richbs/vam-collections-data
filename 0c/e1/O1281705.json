The artist often uses found material in his work, going through skips or pilfering materials from derelict buildings.\n\nThe book's pages, which are finished with Tilson\u2019s own artistic touches, tell the story of a round trip on an 88 London bus from Chiswick to the National Gallery to look at \u2018The Nativity\u2019 by Piero della Francesca, post nuclear holocaust.\n\nIn his publications for the Woolley Dale Press the found material used is of the graphic variety, and takes the form of elaborate collages produced by means of colour Xeroxing. In \u2018Exposure\u2019 the collaged compilations of photographs, media headlines, trademarks and graphic signs are interwoven with narrative fragments to depict a visually riotous and intriguing urban adventure.",
