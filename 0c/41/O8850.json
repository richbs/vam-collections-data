            "public_access_description": "Stained-glass windows could be very expensive to produce. A church wishing to glaze its windows with elaborately painted glass would have to seek sponsorship. In large cathedrals, wealthy ecclesiastics or members of royal families would often supply the necessary funds. Smaller institutions would have to seek financial assistance from well-off members of their communities. The people who contributed these funds are known as 'donors'. If they are depicted in the window they financed, as in this example, the windows are known as 'donor windows'. \n\nDonors may or may not have had a say in the subject matter of the windows they contributed to. Often, the subjects, or themes, would have been determined by the needs of the church, but donors could request that they be depicted somewhere in the scheme, accompanied by their patron saint, as we see in this panel.\n\nThe donor in this panel is Geldulph de Nausnydere, who was alderman of Louvain (Leuven) in 1517 and 1524. It was placed at the base of a window, possibly in the south chapel of the Charterhouse of Louvain, which was a monastery of the Carthusian Order. The Charterhouse was founded at the end of the 15th century [DG13]by the dukes of Burgundy. It was financed with donations from ducal family members, as well as from clerics of the surrounding areas and local residents.",

The panels probably originally flanked a panel with the Virgin and Child with St Anne, Joseph and Joachim now in Earsham Church on the Norfolk/Suffolk border.  It is likely that the panels were originally placed in one of the south chapel windows of the church of the Charterhouse of Louvain.  The long inscription at the bottom of the panel is an intrusion from a different scene.",

In large cathedrals, wealthy ecclesiastics or members of royal families would often supply the necessary funds. Smaller institutions would have to seek financial assistance from well-off members of their communities. The people who contributed these funds are known as 'donors' and if they are depicted in the window they financed, as in this example, those windows are known as 'donor windows'. \n\nDonors may or may not have had a say in the subject matter of the windows they contributed to. Often, the subjects, or themes, would have been determined by the needs of the church but the donor could request that he or she be depicted somewhere in the scheme and be accompanied by their patron saint, as we see in this panel.\n\nThe donor in this panel is Geldulph de Nausnydere who was alderman of Louvain (Leuven) in 1517 and 1524. This panel was placed at the base of a window, possibly in a the south chapel of the Charterhouse of Louvain. The Charterhouse in Louvain was a monastery of the Carthusian Order founded at the end of the 15th century by the Dukes of Burgundy. It was financed with donations from the ducal family members as well as from clerics of the surrounding areas and local residents.",
