On graduating in 1970 Branch received a series of fellowships and residencies which took him to Italy, Germany and the United States. He taught at the Slade and was an adjunct professor of art at the University of California at Berkeley, then associate professor at Kansas State University before returning to the Caribbean in 1994. He has exhibited internationally and examples of his work are held in public and private collections around the world.\n\nBranch was teaching at the Slade (and other London art schools) during the period in which this work was made. The form of the silkscreen, in three panels, seems to suggest a triptych. Hieroglyphic line drawings dominate the two outer panels and much of the central panel is filled with an explosion of colour and light. These two qualities remained Branch\u2019s key interests and the means by which he sought to make a visual and emotional impact through his work.",
