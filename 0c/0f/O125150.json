            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, pp. 198-200\nThe following is an extract from the text of the entry:\n\n\"The sketch has been laid down on card in recent years; there is no record of any inscription on the back. \nThis sketch was used by David Lucas in the preparation of his mezzotint 'Stoke by Neyland' (5. 9; s. : L., pp. 167 and 168) which was begun in 1829 and published in the second number of <i>English Landscape Scenery</i>, December 1830. \nThe plate was much altered during the proof stages, and the published version only partially follows No. 330 [150-1888]. It does so in the ramification of the right-hand trees (Holmes, <i>Burlington Magazine</i>, Vol. LVIII, 1931, p. 253), and in the figure of the woman carrying the bundle in the right foreground. The latter feature was introduced at the second stage of the proofs (S. 9b). The arrangement of the cottages round the church tower is taken from the drawing No. 331 [261-1876].  The oil sketch No. 1819 (now in the Tate Gallery; it was in the National Gallery when the <i>Catalogue of the British School</i>, 1946, was prepared) is based upon the same composition, but is not necessily connected directly with the mezzotint (Davies, pp. 31-2).  A large oil-painting based upon this composition is in the Art Institute of Chicago (reproduced in L. ed. S., Pl. 124a).\nHolmes, p. 249, dates c. 1831, under the impression that the plate was published c. 1832; the history given above shows that the sketch is likely to have been made in 1829 of 1830.  Holmes notes that No. 330 [150-1888] does not appear to be a study from nature but a comparison with Nos. 329a [787-1888, back] and 332 [132-1888], which are here taken to be <i>ad hoc</i> productions for the engraver.  Constable composed a text for the plate: this is quoted in full (two versions) by Shirley (S. : L., pp. 255-7); an extract is given by Leslie (L.ed. S., pp. 337-8).  The thunder-clouds and noon-tide rainbow which form its main theme are atmospheric effects of the finished plate not apparent in No. 330 [150-1888].\nThough there are eleven sketches of Stoke-by Nayland Church in the sketch-books Nos. 121 [317-1888] and 132 [1259-1888], none has any close affinity with Nos. 330 [150-1888], 331 [261-1876], or with the mezzotint, but possibly No. 132 [1259-1888], p. 39, may have been used for some details.\"",
