            "physical_description": "Description: Woven silk satin embroidered with couched silk and metal thread and silk in straight stitches faced with a border of woven silk and metal thread, backed with plain weave cotton and faced with bias-cut woven silk.\nLight blue ground pieced before being embroidered.  There is a repeating pattern of two motifs:\n[1] a squarish octagon with 8 black and red lozenges around its edge; there is a small red flower head in the centre with 4 black leaves and this is enclosed by a narrow black 8-pointed frame with 4 green blossoms and 4 faded pink ones.\n[2] a diamond shape with similar central flower head and 8-pointed frame with 4 faded pink blossoms and 4 pink buds.\nBetween these are hexagonal cartouches containing a black S-shape on a red ground.  Two black leaves emerge from this.\nThis repeating pattern is stopped abruptly by an embroidered border pattern consisting of a line of white/silver roundels alternating with horizontal red lobed cartouches.  There is a small red dot between these motifs and half black leaves [?] to either side.\nA woven border is attached: metal thread ground with weft of silver very loosely S-wound on white silk and pink flowers and leaves outlined with green. Above and below these flowers is a narrow band  of black spots on a yellow ground.  This fabric may have been woven as a repeating pattern of bands which have then been cut and applied as the border.\nEmbroidery Threads: 2S-plied silk: black, pink, faded pink, green, white, light blue which has been used in places to couch the black silk.\nMetal thread: silver strip very loosely S-wound around a white silk core, on a red silk core when it is used for the hexagonal cartouches in the field and in the embroidered border and also on  a black silk core.\nSome under-drawing can be seen within the half leaves of the embroidered border.  There was to be a small internal leaf, but the embroiderer ignored it.\nThere is a mistake along the lower edge of the field, in the central partial octagon: couched white/silver thread has been used instead of red within two of the black lozenges.  Red silk has been stitched over one to correct the mistake.\nBacking: plain weave cream cotton.\nFacing: silk, stripes: yellow, olive green, red, white and fine black lines.",
