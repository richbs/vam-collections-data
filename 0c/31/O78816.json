When the basic tools of shuttle and size gauge were refined to make a smaller mesh, the use of net for decorative purposes became possible. In the 18th and early 19th centuries, netting was a popular pastime for amateurs, as well as a commercial craft. The tools needed for it - netting needles and gauges of different sizes, and sometimes bodkins and hooks - were often kept in decorated cases. This cut bone case is in the most usual, cylindrical form.\n\nOwnership & Use\nNetting was carried out at home in different materials and scale for a variety of uses, including protecting crops and trapping wildlife, as well as decorative accessories like purses. In 1783 the Duchess of Portland was found by a visitor  to be making a net to protect a cherry tree, and this utilitarian aspect made netting one of the few drawing-room occupations permitted to men. The steel tools contained in this case belonging to the V&A would have been used to make net with a small mesh.",
