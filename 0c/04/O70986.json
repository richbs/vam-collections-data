The range was intended for either commercial or domestic use, and was based on a system of interchangeable parts. Customers could choose the size of the piece, and the arrangement of panels (flat or 'dimpled'), drawers, materials, colours and finishes. There were two main sources for the design. The first were the modular storage systems that had been developed for domestic use in Germany in the 1920s. The second was American metal office furniture of the early 20th century. The Storage Unit was also intimately related to the Eames's own house, which was designed at the same time. Like the unit, the house had a steel framework with different coloured panels set into it.",

Its elements were part of a interchangable system that allowed users to virtually design their own storage system. The basic steel frame units were made in different sizes. It allowed two widths, three heights and one depth. The frames could be fitted with a large variety of drawer units or open or closed shelving. The latter came with wood or plastic sliding doors. The sides and back could be enclosed by wire struts, metal grilles, plywoods and solid or laminated plastic.\nThis example came from the office of a mid-Western, American architect. It is unusual in its subtile grey and tan colours; the red, blue and white versions were more common. This unit is from the very first production with the original steel legs, a detail dropped when the firm decided to ship the units erected rather than knocked-down.",

Both the storage unit and the house were made of parts derived from industry and their appearance was based on a steel frame, reinforced by wire struts.",
