Perhaps the most likely were that they were used to protect scientfic instruments or clock, but they may also have been used to protect fine bookbinding. This case is covered with a thin layer of very fine hide, probably calf skin, dyed green. The decoration was applied after the case was assembled by damping down the hide and impressing it with a variety of heated tools. Gouges, rollers and stamps were used to create a recessed pattern which, once the hide was dry, would last indefinitely. The pattern was then filled with gold leaf and polished.\n\nBoth the lid and the body of the case are tooled with the initial IG and two crescents or horseshoes. These must be the initials and emblems of the original owner of the box, who was presumably wealthy and interested in books. Despite these clues we have so far been unable to discover who he or she was.",
