He created settings and costumes for all forms of entertainment - ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue - as well as working in interior decoration and textile design. His lavish, painterly and romantic concepts were perfectly in tune with the times and earned him an international reputation.  By 1960, however, that style was becoming unfashionable, and Messel gradually abandoned theatre and built a new career designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nAnatole de Grunwald commissioned Messel to design costumes and sets for a film version of Alexander Pushkin's supernatural short story The Queen of Spades in 1949.  Post war rationing meant that materials were difficult to acquire and Messel had to create 19th century  St Petersburg on a shoestring budget in a small studio at Welwyn Garden City. This idea for the Countess's arrival at the baroque Palace of St Germain, where she is confronted by a line of sinister statues, was not realised in this form in the film.",

The designs were briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being housed at the V&A from 1981 on indefinite loan.  The V&A Theatre Museum purchased the Oliver Messel collection from Lord Snowdon in 2005.",
