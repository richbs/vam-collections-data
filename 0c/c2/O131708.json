From about 1615-1670 they were the commonest type of relatively comfortable chair in what today we would call middle- and upper-class homes, and remained in use long after that. They were often fitted with fixed covers of leather or wool, or used with a loose cushion supported on a board seat, as here. The design of this example, in walnut, was probably influenced by continental chairs and can be approximately dated by the style of turned ornament on the back and front legs.",
