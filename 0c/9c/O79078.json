The tray is shaped so as make it easy for a maid to carry.\n\nOwnership & Use\nTrays were supplied in sets of three or more in different shapes and sizes for serving tea in drawing rooms. As rooms used mainly by women, these were most likely to be decorated in styles, patterns and colours based on 18th-century French designs, similar to those of this tray. Such designs were fashionable for these rooms as they were light and decorative and so considered feminine. Papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 \u201a was preferred to metal for trays because it dulled the sound of clinking glass and china when used for serving food or drinks.\n\nMaterials & Making\nPapier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 was made by pasting layers of paper over moulds of the required shape, a job mainly done by women and girls. The object was then oiled and baked at very high temperatures. The shape of this tray would have been finished by a cabinet-maker before it was varnished and dried in a stove. The mother-of-pearl was applied before the painted decoration, which was followed by a final coat of varnish, further stove drying, and polishing.",
