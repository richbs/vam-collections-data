The sides and top of the cover have valances made in one piece with the top, but the foot of the cover has been cut away at the corners to enable a foot valance to hang neatly. The top valance is decorated with the wave-motifs but the side and foot valances which are mainly formed by the feather-filled borders, have edging elaborately patterned with inter-laced scroll and feather motifs.\nAll the areas are out-line by rows of tiny inter-laced scrolls, containing eyelet holes.\nThe curtain (A) is one of a pair and decorated with a vertical panel of feather motifs in the centre and with borders along the sides and lower edge of inter-laced feather and scroll motifs (as on the sides and foot of the cover).",

According to the donor's family history, this bed cover and curtain had been passed down within the family, and were originally owned by the Hynde Cottons.\n\nHistorical significance: In eighteenth-century Britain, the bedrooms of the wealthy were used for the display of luxury goods. They were a place where servants entered, family members rested and guests were entertained. Beautifully worked bed hangings and bed covers were found in both middle-class and aristocratic households, and were often more costly that the bed that they dressed.",

In 1724 he married Margaret Trefusis, who brought with her a substantial dowry that included real estate, \u00a317,000 of capital, as well as her personal jewels and plate. An inventory of Madingley Hall in 1734 shows that 36 rooms were furnished to the height of luxury and fashion. The bedrooms were named according to the colour of their textiles.",
