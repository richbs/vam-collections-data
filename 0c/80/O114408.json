The set (inv.nos. A.4 to 60-1998) belonged to John Bacon the Elder, a highly prolific and successful sculptor, one of his most celebrated works is the monument to Lord Chatham (Pitt the Elder) in Westminster Abbey. Bacon also designed sculpture to be made in Coadestone, an artificial stone which was widely used for garden and architectural sculpture in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century. His son, John Bacon the Younger (1777-1859) was also a sculptor, and specialised in tombs using coloured marbles. The tools descended from the older sculptor to his son, and were then passed through the family until they were presentated as a gift to the Museum in 1998.",
