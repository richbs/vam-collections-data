By the woman's left side is a straw-work layette basket on a table.  With her right hand she holds out a teething coral on a black ribbon to a young child on her right, who is seated in an enclosed wooden chair on wheels, and is wearing a white gown trimmed with lace and a white cap trimmed with black ribbon.\nThe frame is made of gessoed and gilded wood with a black-painted surround, probably 20th century.",
