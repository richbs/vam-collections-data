On the back, a \nmulberry (<i>morus nigra</i>)  \nNumbered in ink <i>39</i> \nWater- and body-colour. 22.2 x 16.8 cm \nVAM A.M.3267.W-1856 \n \nThe drawing is one of a series of 57 fruit and \nflower drawings by Le Moyne, identified in \n1922 and extracted from an album which had \nbeen bought by the Museum Library in 1856 \nfor the importance of its 16th century French \nbinding. The evidence on other sheets of the  \nwatermark (which is close to Briquet 12826, \nfound on paper in use in France, 1556-1568) \nand of titles inscribed in French as well as \nLatin, possibly by the artist, could point to the \nfact that the drawings were made before Le \nMoyne left France for England; most probably \nthey were made about 1568, shortly after his \nreturn to France from Laudonni\u00e8re\u2019s ex- \npedition to Florida, on which expedition he \nhad been employed as recording artist. Le \nMoyne combined intensity of vision with an \nability to express form, colour and texture \nwith microscopic exactness. Botanical illus- \ntrations like these met the demand of educated \nmen who were inquisitive about the natural  \nworld and anxious to examine it in detail.\n(British Museum, P. H.
