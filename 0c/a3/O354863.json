Smaller intervening circles contain busts, with triangular floral devices above and below.  At the extreme right is a nude standing figure.  The square panels are incomplete; each contains a circle enclosing two horsemen spearing a wild animal, and birds in the spandrels. The circles on the lower band and the square are outlined by interlaced floral and geometrical ornament.  The ground is red.
