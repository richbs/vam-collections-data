            "public_access_description": "The Hungarian-born Ervin Bossanyi developed his stained-glass skills while working in L\u00fcbeck in Germany between 1919 and 1929. In 1924 his wife gave birth to a son, and it was then that he began to use the \u2018mother and son\u2019 theme that appears throughout his career. He believed that a mother\u2019s love was unselfish and represented the core of human goodness.\n\nBossanyi moved his family to England in 1934 and was noticed by a fellow Hungarian, Rozsike Rothschild, who became his patroness. Some of his first works in England were for London University and the new Uxbridge Station.\n\nHe began experimenting with new types of glass-painting pigments through the auspices of the firm of Hancocks in Worcester. Hancocks, a specialist paint manufacturer, had been taken over by the Johnson Matthey Organisation, which controlled the Whitefriars Glassworks. Johnson Matthey commissioned Bossanyi to make a glass panel painted with the new pigments he had worked on with Hancocks. \n\nThe result was the Noli me tangere panel on display in the Victoria and Albert Museum. Bossanyi made this panel when he learnt that his 93-year-old mother had died in a concentration camp. \n\nBossanyi describes this work: \u2018I wanted in this glass only the symbols of motherly and filial love, the building of the family home and the deep relationship between the human child and all beauty and grace nature produces and which must not be hurt or destroyed. In this sense should the inscription [\u2018Noli me tangere\u2019] be understood\u2019.",

            "historical_context_note": "Bossanyi developed his stained glass skills while working in Lubeck in Germany between 1919 and 1929. He learnt from Carl Berkentien, an established decorative glass artist in Lubeck. Bossanyi and Berkentien restored old church glass and had commissions for new work for the churches in the town. The skills he acquired during this time included engraving, etching, staining and painting on glass.\n\nIn 1924, his wife gave birth to his son and it is from this time that the \u2018mother and son\u2019 theme begins to appear in many of his works. Bossanyi would revisit this theme throughout his career. He believed that a mother\u2019s love was unselfish and represented the core of human goodness.\n\nFrom 1929 until 1934, Bossanyi worked primarily in Hamburg. His work was very well received. Unfortunately, much of this was destroyed in the second world war.\n\nHe moved his family to England in 1934 and was noticed by a fellow Hungarian, Rozsike Rothschild, who became his patroness. She introduced him to influential people such as Sir Evan Charteris, Chairman of the Tate Gallery Trustees. Some of Bossanyi\u2019s first works in England were for the London University and the new Uxbridge Station.\n\nBossanyi began experimenting with new types of glass-painting pigments through the auspices of the firm of Hancocks in Worcester. Hancocks, a specialist paint manufacturer, had been taken over by the Johnson Matthey Organisation who controlled the Whitefriars Glassworks. Bossanyi was commissioned by Johnson Matthey to make a glass panel painted with the new pigments he had worked on with Hancocks. \n\nThe result was the \u2018Noli Me Tangere\u2019 panel on display in the V&A. Bossanyi made this panel at the time he learnt that his 93-year old mother had been taken to a concentration camp where she had died. \n\nBossanyi describes this work:\nI wanted in this glass only the symbols of motherly and filial love, the building of the family home and the deep relationship between the human child and all beauty and grace nature produces and which must not be hurt or destroyed. In this sense should the inscription [\u2018Noli me tangere\u2019] be understood.\n\nIn the 1950s Bossanyi was commissioned to make eight windows for the Michaelhouse Chapel, Natal in South Africa. The rose window was painted with the head of Christ, his hands raised in blessing and holding two birds, one black and one white. This was to symbolise the joining of the two racial groups in South Africa.\n\nThroughout his career, Bossanyi was concerned about getting the right balance of the play of light through his glass. He describes his work:\nWhen the sun comes through at the right angle a great number of glasses will send forth quite brilliant-like colours. These I made by chips of very thick colour glassslabs, faceted and bevelled to fit into the lead, by the diamond grinding wheel.\n\nAt this time Bossanyi\u2019s reputation as a major stained glass artist was secure. He was commissioned to create works by both Canterbury and York Cathedrals.",
