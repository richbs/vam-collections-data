            "physical_description": "Oval oak table with two gatelegs, and flat-twist legs imitating spiral turning, of joined construction.\n\nThe top consists of a fixed board doweled the frame, to which the flaps (meeting in a plain butt joint) are held by three modern and two older, nailed butterfly hinges (one of which is broken). The top has been secured using modern glued blocks underneath. One flap has a pieced-in section 15.5cm wide, the other flap has a pieced-in section 8cm wide, and both have an added stop-block (to position the gatelegs). One flap shows filled nail holes, suggesting a re-used floor board. The central, fixed board also has several small filled holes that serve no apparent purpose.\n\nThe frame is joined using through-tenons, and hand-made nails have been added to secure the mortice and tenon joints at the two stretchers. The underside of the two short rails has been carved with a simple, flat ogee. Both longer rails (and possibly the two short, carved rails) appear to be replacements. The two long stretchers have moulded upper surfaces, and each has a simple cut-out to receive the gateleg. The six legs have been carved on their narrow sides to imitate spiral turning, and have a simple, integral pad foot. One gateleg foot has been repaired, but otherwise there is little wear on the feet.\n\nA dark stain has been added overall.\n\nThe table was probably restored, probably c.1900. Given the lack of wear on the feet, and flatness of the legs it is possible that it was created entirely c.1870-1910, but it is perhaps unlikely that that someone would have gone to the trouble of adding 'period' repairs to a new, fake table of relatively low value.",

By 1600 a strong framed 'gate' developed that swung out from the main frame to support each leaf.  Gateleg tables (as they are now known), usually made of oak, and with oval tops, would be folded down at the side of the room between meals. \n\nThis gateleg table is a relatively unsophisticated example, perhaps made by a provincial joiner who was unable or unwilling to obtain turned elements, since its carved legs imitate the spiral turning that was fashionable after about 1660. The loose leaves meet the fixed top in a flush-edged 'butt joint' instead of a neater tongue-and-groove type joint. Like many gateleg tables, the top has been restored.",
