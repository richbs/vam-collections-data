            "public_access_description": "Thomas Dimsdale (1712-1800), an English doctor and advocate of the practice of inoculation against smallpox, was summoned by the Russian ambassador to advise Catherine II during the Russian smallpox epidemic of 1768. So impressed was Catherine by the success of the potentially dangerous treatment that Thomas was created a Baron of the Russian Empire, a councillor of state and personal physician to the Empress, and awarded a princely sum of \u00a310,000 plus an annuity and works of art. His son, Nathaniel was presented with this magnificent diamond-encrusted, varicoloured-gold snuffbox, decorated with figures in neo-classical landscapes by Paul 'as a testimony of his regard'. The box may have been made in either St Petersburg or Berlin.\n\nThe Gilbert Collection is also fortunately endowed with a miniature portrait of Thomas, 1st Baron Dimsdale (Loan: Gilbert. 257-2008) - enamelled by Henry Bone in 1800  in the final year of his life. \n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world\u2019s great decorative art collections, including silver,  mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
