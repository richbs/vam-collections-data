These included early 19th century French desks in the Empire style, and German ones in the more solid and homely Biedermeier style. In these earlier models the chair was usually attached and released by mechanical means. In this example, however, Koloman Moser (1868-1918) decided that a large brass handle inserted into the back of the chair would perform the task equally well. He designed numerous chairs and desks of this kind. This particular example was part of a commission to design two rooms for the apartment of Dr H\u00f6lzl, a prominent doctor in Vienna, Austria. The straight lines, flat surfaces and stylized ornament are all typical of Moser's work.",

London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1997, pp. 360-361 ISBN: 1851772170\nDuring the last twenty years, the V&A has attempted to redress earlier neglect by retrospective acquisition of objects, such as this desk and armchair considered central to a history of twentieth-century design. In this extraordinary piece, Koloman Moser, one of the Viennese Secession group that also included Gustav Klimt, combined the elegance of early-nineteenth-century Biedermeier furniture with a simplicity and geometry that was entirely new to the style, perhaps inspired by Mackintosh (see cat. 169). While recognisably \"protomodern,\" this Moser piece is also in the grand cabinetmaking tradition of earlier centuries. Made for Dr. H\u00f6lzl's apartment, the set's design was coordinated with the unified decoration of the furniture and the interior.\nExhibitions in New York in 1978 and in Vienna in 1981 reawakened interest in this period of Viennese design. Subsequently, the V&A acquired many of the objects shown in Vienna, as the Museum concentrated on the formation of a representative collection of twentieth-century material. The desk now forms the centrepiece of a group of Viennese objects collected by the Museum in the early 1980s, including luxury furniture and bentwood for mass production.\n \nLit.
