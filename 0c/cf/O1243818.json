Banknotes are a favour item for production, and many magicians use their own novelty money, printed with photographs and jokes. \n\nAmerican George Johnstone (1919-2004) was famous for his comedy magic act. The banknote lists some of his engagements, including the Ed Sullivan Show, on which he first appeared in 1950, and an Elvis Presley tour which took place in 1956.",
