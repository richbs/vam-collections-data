Unlike Ruskin or Morris, he fully accepted the implications of mechanical production, and was always more interested in design than craftsmanship. In 1876 he made his first visit to Japan, which had a profound effect on him. Many of his highly original shapes for metalwork were the result of his interest in mass production techniques combined with his concern for function and performance.",
