The central area can best be described like the sole of a large shoe - curved at the top [like the heel of a shoe] and pointed at the bottom [like the toes of a shoe] - with a flap-like extension to the right which is rounded at the top and which extends about two-thirds of the way down the main piece and has a straight edge at the bottom.  Three metal buckles are attached to the right hand side with three leather straps on the left hand side.  Towards the top of each piece there is a strip of leather through which the fingers and the thumb of the right hand can be inserted.\nAn interlining of coarse cotton can be seen in areas of wear.  The front is covered with a woven fabric in dark green and black silk - this was probably a velvet and traces of pile can be seen near the edges.  Metal studs, possibly lead, have been sewn into a lattice pattern - each lozenge containing a rosette.  The studs seem to have a lug underneath through which they are stitched in place.  Tablet woven braid is used to bind the edges: it has two patterns - pink, white, light blue and yellow and black, white and pink.\n[Arm guard] Left-hand gauntlet, of the type probably used for hawing, leather with silk velvet and metal studs, interlined with plain weave cotton and  trimmed with silk tablet-woven braid, fastening with metal buckles.\nDescribed open; the inside shows it is made from three pieces of leather sewn together.  The central area can best be described like the sole of a large shoe - curved at the top [like the heel of a shoe] and pointed at the bottom [like the toes of a shoe] - with a flap-like extension to the left which is rounded at the top and which extends about two-thirds of the way down the main piece and has a straight edge at the bottom.  Three metal buckles are attached to the left hand side with three leather straps on the right hand side.  Towards the top of each piece there is a strip of leather through which the fingers and the thumb of the right hand can be inserted.\nBecause of the extensive damage, at least five layers of coarse cotton interlining can be seen. The front is covered with a woven fabric in dark green and black silk - this was probably a velvet and traces of pile can be seen near the edges.  Metal studs, possibly lead, have been sewn into a lattice pattern - each lozenge containing a rosette.  The studs seem to have a lug underneath through which they are stitched in place.
