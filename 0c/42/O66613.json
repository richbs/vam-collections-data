The veiled heroes Hashim and Haris throw a giant, clad in armour lavishly decorated with gold, from a rocky outcrop. The centre of the composition is filled with the tumbling, upside-down figure. Horses are shown at lower left and lower right, their bodies cut off by the limits of the composition. Groups of men watch the falling giant from behind the rocks in the background, registering their shock and amazement through stock gestures of Iranian art. The surface is damaged and the faces of most of the onlookers have been repainted.",

Their production was the first major project of the royal painting workshops during Akbar's reign: it took 15 years to complete, probably between 1562 and 1577. The stories, from a long-established oral tradition, were written down in Persian, the language of the court, and originally had 1400 illustrations of which fewer than 200 have survived. The artists were directed by Mir Sayyed 'Ali and 'Abd as-Samad, two Iranian masters brought to India by Akbar's father. No independent, contemporary version of the text is known, and so many of the original pages are lost that it is difficult to reconstruct the complicated stories depicting battles between Hamza and his heroic followers, and their enemies. These included unbelievers, dragons, witches and giants.\n\nIn this painting, Hashim and Haris come as veiled knights to drive the unbelievers from Hamza's camp.",
