Mina, long at the forefront of contemporary experimentation with precious metals, explains that platinum is \u2018not hard, cold or tough\u2019 but \u2018capable of great delicacy, elegance and preciousness\u2019. \n\nJacqueline Mina is otherwise known for her innovative and pioneering use of gold. She creates surfaces that are naturally patterned and sensual in feel. One of her pioneering techniques is a fusion inlay with platinum and gold. She continues to push the boundaries of goldsmithing techniques to find new expression.\n\nJacqueline Mina writes in the foreword of a catalogue to the exhibition \u2018Or Gold\u2019, which she curated in 2004: \u201cI know from my own practice that gold as an artistic medium is an undeniably versatile metal and that many imaginative artists choose to use it for its limitless physical possibilities. In addition to the appreciation of its natural characteristics they find that their jewellery is endowed with an allure that is carried down from antiquity in the collective subconscious.\u201d",
