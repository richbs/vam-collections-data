Ian Spurling's highly idiosyncratic designs were a feature of both versions, prefiguring the later revival of interest in Art Deco.  His decorative, witty costumes, executed in bright colours including such then unfashionable shades as lime green and vermilion, were an acclaimed feature of the production. They are decorative, imaginative and characteristic of their time in making and fabrics. \n\nThe Theatre Museum also owns designs for the 1961 version of the ballet.",
