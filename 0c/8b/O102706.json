It has been adopted almost universally by scholars when speaking of a human figure stripped of its skin and thus displaying the superficial layers of muscles. Sculpted models or statuettes in which the muscles of the body are revealed (or \u00e9corch\u00e9s) first appeared in sixteenth century Europe, and in Italy primarily.",
