It would have been accompanied by an \u2018aspergillum\u2019 or sprinkler. \n\nIt was made in Venice and has the distinctive type of decoration associated with the city. This was influenced by the objects brought to the city by Venetian merchants trading with the Turkish and Arab empires that bordered the Mediterranean.\n\nVenetian brasswork was almost always engraved and often inlaid with silver wire (now missing on this example). The decoration was extensive, often covering the entire surface of an object. It featured the arabesque pattern, seen here, based on a stylised plant with a winding stem. Contemporary Italian artists studied and copied the pattern and by about the 1550s, the arabesque as a form of ornament was beginning to influence designers and craftsmen all over Europe.",
