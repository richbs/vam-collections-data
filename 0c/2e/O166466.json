The classically-inspired broken pediment reveals the influence of the architect William Kent, whose bold formal interior schemes for his patrons also included lavish use of carved and gilded ornament, including the acanthus leaf and fleur de lys found on this mirror frame.  Kent's taste was informed by extensive travels in Italy and his knowledge of the works of the 16th-century Italian architect Andrea Palladio. Here the scrolling acanthus carvings contrast with the plain granular surface of the border to the mirror-glass. The designer and maker of this example are not known.\n\nCurrently on loan to Valentines Mansion, Redbridge.",
