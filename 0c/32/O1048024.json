Mrs Lloyd was married first to Alexander Macalister of Torriedale (divorced) and second to Morgan Lloyd, Q.C., with whom she had three children: Clement Elphinstone Lloyd, Marion Lloyd (married General John North Crealock, brother of Henry Hope Crealock, the Army artist) and Malcolm Elphinstone Fleeming Lloyd. Mrs Lloyd died in 1859 after suffering from poor health for many years, and Lady Hawarden assumed responsibility for Marion, who lived with her family in the early 1860s.'",
