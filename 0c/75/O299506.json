Acquired as an 'imitation of the Barberini diptych, which will be of considerable interest' (letter of Eric Maclagan, 16 December, 1937).\n\nHistorical significance: It is immediately apparent that the two plaques are copied from the celebrated 'Barberini diptych leaf' now in the Louvre in Paris, a Constantinopolitan work of the second quarter of the 6th century. The question of whether the copyist also carved the other two surviving plaques of the original or confined himself to the present two panels must remain unanswered. In style, facture and choice of material the two plaques clearly relate to a small group of forgeries identified by Eric Maclagan and attributed by him to a Milanese faker in the first quarter of the 19th century. These four reliefs were until the 2nd World War in the Liverpool Museum but were lost to fire in 1941. They had entered the Liverpool Museum with the rest of the great collection of ivories formed by the Hungarian Gabor Fej\u00e9rv\u00e1ry (1781-1851) and were probably purchased by him in Italy in the 1820s or 1830s.\nThe Barberini diptych leaf was in the Barberini collection in Rome between about 1625 and 1899, but a number of errors and changes in the 19th century copy suggests that the forger was not working from the original.",
