Maurice Lambert (1902-1964) is an example of the many sculptors who were affected by the work of Rodin. The forms here are defined but not detailed. Although the surface of the group is lively, it no longer depends on naturalistic representations. Lambert was the son of a painter, George Washington Lambert. He trained in London from 1919 to 1923 in the studio of Francis Derwent Wood (1871-1926). In 1927 a contemporary commentator, P. G. Konody, described Lambert as having 'thrown himself heart and soul into the Modern Movement'. He worked in a wide range of materials, often in combination, including brass, marble, alabaster, lead and aluminium, and executed ideal works as well as portrait busts. Lambert's first major show was in June 1927 at the Claridge Gallery, London. He was Master of Sculpture at the Royal Academy Schools between 1950 and 1958, and was a prolific exhibitor at the Royal Academy of Arts from 1938 to 1964. An exhibition of his work was held at the Belgrave Gallery, London, in 1988. A marble sculpture by Lambert entitled  Man with a bird, formerly in the Museum's collection, was transferred to London's Tate Gallery in 1982.",
