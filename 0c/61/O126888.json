This was characterised by the depiction  of Hindu deities, usually within cartouches reserved against scrolling decoration. A stopper surmounted by a monkey is attached to the tube with a chain. The style was particularly associated with the Madras firm of P. Orr and Sons, who were appointed \"Jewellers and Silversmiths to His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales\" on 22 April 1876 during his official tour of India that year. The patterns on this piece are very close to those illustrated in the firm's catalogue issued ca. 1876, suggesting that it was made at about the same time.",
