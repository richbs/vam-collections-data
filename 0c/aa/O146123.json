Note: researchers may use the terms applique and tambour when searching for this category of textile even though they are incorrect.\nRhomboid shape with a section cut from either side, about one third down from the top, for the stirrups.\nThere is a square central panel with a blue ground with a pink vase or urn resting on a pedestal base; there is a large central blue roundel.  There is a trefoil shape in each of the upper corners and a roundel in the lower corners; all these are connected with the vase/urn.  All the main elements are outlined with black and decorated with small white dots which probably represent pearls. Everything is extensively  covered with flowers and leaves including carnations.\nThere are narrow borders of yellow and green.\nInner border: pieced; red ground with opposed blue and white undulating lines forming a line of cusped sections each containing a black rosette with either purple of cream embroidery.\nMain border: not present in the area cut away for the stirrups. Blue ground, pieced; line of red ovals alternating with green lobed lozenges both outlined with white dots representing pearls. The ovals contain a blue flower and the lozenges contain a red flower.\nOuter border: also not in the cut out section.  Black ground with the same design as the inner border but the flowers are red, the lines are light brown and white and the embroidery is purple.\nOutermost border of red wool, undecorated  except for the lower sides and along the lower edge where there are two types of floral motif: [1] stylised sprig in white and purple.  Note: some of the purple has faded [analine dye?] and some has not [from another source?]. [2] botehs outlined with white dots representing pearls.  Three botehs point to the left and the remainder point to the right.\nEmbroidery thread: 2S silk; multi-coloured [too many to identify]\nInset wool: dark pink, pink, beige, black, grey, white, blue, yellow, green, purple.\nBacking: brown plain weave cotton patched with the same colour silk.",
