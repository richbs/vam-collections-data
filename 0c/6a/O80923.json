The hem would probably also have been given additional weight by a facing of thicker material. The materials, design and technique are all typical of the fine embroidery of Kutch, part of the modern state of Gujarat in north-western India.This type of  chain-stitch embroidery was the speciality of professional male embroiderers from the Mochi community of Kutch in Gujarat. They were originally leather workers and had developed a technique of silk embroidery on leather using a type of hooked awl. This method was later adapted for use on cloth. The Mochi work of Kutch is among the finest embroidery ever produced in India, and was used for textiles at the Mughal court as well as for the wealthy patrons of urban Gujarat.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThis skirt-piece is embroidered with a repeating floral pattern on a rich yellow ground. While the ground colour is typical of Kutch embroidery, the floral motifs have obviously been influenced by Mughal designs. Floral patterns like this were usually interspersed with peacocks or human figures in the more traditional Kutchi pieces.",
