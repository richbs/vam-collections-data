            "public_access_description": "This poster was produced at the time of the Iranian Revolution in 1979. The central figure depicts Ayatollah Khomeini, an iconic figure of the Revolution. \n\nDuring the 1970's in Iran there were growing calls for social, political and religious change and an end to the rule of Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran. Khomeini was a leading Shi'ia Muslim scholar who had been exiled to France for his opposition to the Shah. He attracted great support from the Iranian population and was influential in advancing the religious character of the Revolution. After his return to Iran, the country voted in favour of replacing the Shah with an Islamic Government, led by Khomeini.\n\nThis poster depicts a protest march in Tehran in which the people are being shot at by the Shah's army. The figure of Khomeini rises out of this chaos, offering his protection and providing an alternative to the Shah's rule.  Central to Khomeini's legitimacy as ruler was his argument that the Revolution was a continuation of the Shi'ia cause. Shi'ite Muslims believe that after the prophet Muhammad's death in 632, his son-in-law Ali was the only rightful successor to lead the Muslim people. In this poster, Khomeini is shown in a similar fashion to popular depictions of Ali. This is reinforced through visual symbolism such as the green flag of Islam fluttering behind his head and the copy of the Qu'ran he holds in his hand.",
