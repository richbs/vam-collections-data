It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre. He compiled them in a series of albums.\n\nA review of his performance at Hanley praised Kenyon for his song \u2018Simple Sandy\u2019, \u2018so quaintly sung, and accompanied as it was by such excellent patter\u2019.\n\nNeil Kenyon (1873-1946) was the Scottish comedian and singer Neil McKinnon. He began his acting career touring with stock companies performing in melodrama and burlesque, and later in Shakespeare revivals produced by Osmond Tearle. He made his variety debut at the London Pavilion in 1904, with songs and musical monologues in broad Scottish dialect. These included \u2018The Caddie\u2019, \u2018The Stationmaster of Dunrobin\u2019 and \u2018The Postie of Dunrobin\u2019. He also appeared in pantomime. In 1913 he performed in a unique private Royal Variety performance for George V and Queen Mary at Lord Derby\u2019s mansion at Knowlsey, near Liverpool.",

He made his debut in variety at the London Pavilion in 1904 and became famous for his broad dialect monologues. This caricature comes from the second album of caricatures in a collection of albums owned by the Theatre Museum compiled by the graphic artist George Cooke.  It is labelled by the artist 'Geo Cooke HYS BOOKE' and features music hall performers working in the early 20th century.",
