The heart of the gul is a red rectangle within a white diamond within a dark blue and red stepped cross from which 3 red trefoils project into the white and light red quarters. Offset between the guls in 2 and 2 half rows are stars with white hooks on narrow vertical lines of small blocks of colour.\n\nMain border: Red ground with octagons framing 8-pointed stars. 'Branches' of small triangles, in either white, light red or dark blue radiate from the octagons. In the upper right hand corner the octagon encloses a double-hooked motif. Across the top and bottom, this border is reduced to octagons in small compartments. In the upper right part of the main border there is a line of 6 double 3-pronged motifs.\n\nInner and outer border: Reciprocal horned pattern with pairs of white florets. The horns in one direction are alternately dark blue and white with the reverse ones in red. In the lowest part of the carpet, dark blue alternates with dark green.\n\nLower band: Incomplete. Red ground shows the remains of a band of concentric lozenges, the lines of which are either hooked or toothed. It would probably have been at least one band of complete lozenges and 2 bands of half lozenges. At the four extremities of each lozenge / part lozenge is the only use of yellow.\nUpper band: Incomplete. Red ground shows remains of 16 vertical lines between which diagonal branches support white, dark blue and dark green triangles.\n\nThe number of colours is restricted after the first 39.5 cms of weaving. Possibly due to either a change in supply or a change in instructions to the weaver.",
