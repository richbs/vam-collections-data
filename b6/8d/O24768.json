Painted scrolls, known as wayang beber, are arguably the oldest art from associated with the tradition of narrative story-telling in Java.  Wayang refers to stylised convention associated with forms of Javanese puppet theatre and beber means unfolding, as in a hand-scroll.  Its use in court circles is documented from the 17th century (a ruler of Mataram is recorded in 1630 banning its use as a court entertainment) although its origins must extend back far earlier, probably at least to the Majapahit Kingdom of eastern Java in the 15th-16th century.  By the turn of this century the tradition was almost extinct, with only a few sets of painted scrolls surviving and even fewer dalangs (master narrators/performers) skilled to perform it.  A number of Dutch scholar/administrators took an interest in this dying art from this time, and copies of single scenes to be an example of this type.  The scene depicts the marriage of hero of the story Panji (centre-right) to Sekar Tadji (centre).  The bride is seen holding her hands respectfully, and betel and areca nut are visible on an offering table.  The painting has considerable areas of paint loss and staining.  Despite condition this painting, as a rare example of an almost extinct art from, would make a fascinating addition to our collection of Javanese arts.",
