Released two weeks before the Never Mind the Bollocks... album, Rotten would leave the band less than four months later. The artwork was based on a real Belgian tourist brochure, with the speech bubbles edited to include the lyrics of the song.. The travel company later sued the Pistols resulting in a court case, and the single was re-issued in a plain white sleeve.\n\nJamie Reid's cut-and-paste aesthetic developed from his interest in radical politics. His artistic style developed while at art college in Croydon, where he was influenced by the ideas of the avant-garde political group, the Situationist International. The political slant to his art was aroused by the May 1968 Paris student riots, which inspired fraternal protests organised by Reid at the Croydon College of Art. These were directed with fellow student Malcolm McLaren, later to become the manager of the Sex Pistols.",
