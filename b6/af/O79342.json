Although individual pieces rarely date back any earlier than the 19th century, the designs are very old, and European observers liked to find traces of Roman or Phoenician influence.\n\nEarrings in the 19th century were particularly large, and are sometimes mistaken for bangles today.  This one was made in Egypt, as the marks make clear, for use by the nomadic tribes of the region, who obtained all their jewellery from specialist urban silversmiths.  The large filigree bead is an early design which was later usually replaced by a cube with truncated corners.\n\nIt was described as having the name halak when it was acquired by the Museum in 1869 which is a generic Arabic name for earrings.",
