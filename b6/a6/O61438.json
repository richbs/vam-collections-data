A. or \u2018Alecco\u2019 Ionides (1840-1898). 'Alecco' and Jeckyll were friends, having studied art together in Paris in the late 1850s, and Ionides commissioned this bedroom furniture after his marriage to Isabella Sechiari in 1875.\n\nJeckyll used many decorative motifs and details derived from Chinese sources for the suite of bedroom furniture. On this commode the combination of dark and light timbers, ebony mouldings, lattice-work panels and small curved brackets below the stretchers all show the influence of Chinese designs. The name, commode, indicates that the cupboard was intended for a chamber pot.",

(Alecco) upon his marriage to Isabella Sechiari and Alecco commissioned designs for a suite of furniture for the master bedroom in the new wing from Jeckyll.
