It is difficult to find any influence either from Chinese porcelain or from contemporary silver. It is, however, entirely functional.\n\nMaterials & Making\nAlmost all surviving Staffordshire teapots of the 1720s are red earthenware with white mould-applied 'sprig' decoration of the type traditionally associated with Astbury of Fenton but also made by others. But here the potters have struggled to produce a range of decorative techniques to suit the comparatively new material, white salt-glazed stoneware. The thickness of the body has been reduced both by lathe-turning and by cutting flats around the belly, which offer flat surfaces for the simple mould-applied sprigs. There is abundant evidence of the potter's skill, from the hand-cutting of the body and spout to the elegant sweep of the handle with its fine knife-cut terminal. Before such pieces were mass-produced, potters took a delight in hand-finishing with a sharp knife. Some of the decorative elements, such as the mould-applied sprigs and rouletting (a band of ornament made by pressing a tool similar to a pastry cutter), were refined and developed later for mass-production, but the fashion for cut facets seems to have passed by the 1730s.\n\nOn this teapot, the definition of the applied ornament is blurred by a coating of fine white slip containing ground calcined flint (flint that has been baked in a furnace and ground to powder). Shortly afterwards this problem was overcome when the Dorset clay bodies were further refined and whitened.",
