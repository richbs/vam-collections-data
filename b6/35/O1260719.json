            "public_access_description": "Born in Yorkshire in 1947, photographer Syd Shelton documented resistance to racism in Britain during the 1970s and 1980s. Shelton photographed historic moments of political activism such as this 1977 demonstration led by the vocal civil rights campaigner and former British Black Panther, Darcus Howe (born 1943). Photographed holding a megaphone, Howe was rallying opposition against a march taking place the same day by the far right political party the National Front. \n\nThe events became known as the \u2018Battle of Lewisham\u2019, as counter protests in support of Lewisham\u2019s black community opposed the National Front\u2019s extreme anti-immigration stance. The diverse support for the black community was seen as a turning point towards the more widespread advocacy for equal treatment in Britain, regardless of race.\n\nThe V&amp;A acquired three of Shelton\u2019s photographs as part of the Staying Power project. A photograph by Charlie Phillips of a picket line protesting the imprisonment of Darcus Howe the same year was also acquired as part of the project. Staying Power is a five year partnership between the V&amp;A and Black Cultural Archives. The project aims to explore black British experience from the 1950s to the 1990s through photographs acquired by the V&amp;A and oral histories conducted by Black Cultural Archives.",
