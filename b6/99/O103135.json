The contract drawn up on the first of December 1537 stipulated that Delezat was to be supplied with the silver to make the cross as well as a further sum to pay for his work. The cross had to include the parish saint, St. Blaise and to be finished by the following January. A parchment drawing was supplied which was approved by both parties. Surviving crosses by the same maker show that he reused stamps from previous work to make the figures of the Virgin Mary, St John, Lazarus rising from his grave and the pelican which can be seen in the plaques on each arm of this cross.\n\nEach figure on the cross has a particular meaning. St John and the Virgin Mary are often represented at either side of Christ on the cross. Lazarus was raised from the dead by Christ and here can be seen sitting on the edge of his tomb. The resurrection of Lazarus can be seen as a precursor for the resurrection of Christ. The pelican, who was believed to feed her young with her own blood in times of famine, is used as a symbol for Christ's sacrifice on the cross.",

This iconography would have been clearly understood in the past but it may be less familiar to modern eyes. \n\nThough often decorative, the symbols used on religious metalwork also refer to the function and significance of the objects. The contemplation of religious motifs can draw   believers into a deeper understanding of their faith. Complex theological themes can be represented in a visual form. A chalice, for example, might be adorned with the tools used in the Crucifixion (the 'Instruments of the Passion') to direct the viewer's mind towards Christ's sacrifice and his death on the cross.\n\nThe use of images has caused controversy throughout Christian history. While supporters held that imagery glorified God and helped believers understand their faith better, critics attacked its use as superstition and idolatry.\n\nSaints\nChristians venerate saints as men and women who, through the holiness of their lives, became especially close to God. The saints include martyrs who suffered and died for their faith as well as great teachers and preachers. Their lives provide an example and inspiration for the faithful. Roman Catholics also believe that saints can intercede on their behalf with God. In Christian iconography, saints are usually depicted with a distinctive object or 'attribute' associated with their martyrdom or works. For example, St Bartholomew, who was skinned alive, holds a flaying knife, and St George is shown with a dragon.",
