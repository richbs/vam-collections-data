At that period 'Irish' also meant the Highland Scots, who were celebrated for using a basket-hilted broadsword of similar type. The guard, which protects the hilt,  and the pommel, which acts as a counterweight to the blade, are heavily overlaid with silver flowers and foliage. This was a characteristically English type of decoration at this period. The blade is engraved and inlaid in gold with religious mottoes in Latin and the royal arms of James I. The design includes a crowned S and an orb and cross - devices used by the cutlers of Solingen.\n\nTrade\nThe blade is also stamped with a cutler's mark - a unicorn's head. This mark was used by Clemens Horn (1580-1630), one of the most prominent Solingen cutlers. Solingen, in central Germany, had a very large export trade and supplied specially commissioned blades.\n\nPeople\nA number of similarly decorated blades have been recorded, including one in Windsor Castle dated 1617 and traditionally said to have belonged to James I.",
