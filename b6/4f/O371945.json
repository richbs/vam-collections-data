This dressing table, which came from Eynsham Hall, Oxfordshire, was probably part of one of these sets, supplied in about 1873.  James Mason, the wealthy owner of Eynsham Hall, commissioned designs for interiors and furniture from the architect and designer, Owen Jones, and the furniture for the main reception rooms was made by the firm of Jackson & Graham. It is likely that this firm also supplied suites of furniture for some of the bedrooms. While the dressing table is quite conventional in design, with the arrangement of mirror and small drawers fitted to a flat top above a pair of pedestals fitted with drawers, the combination of oak with teak and rosewood is less common for bedroom furniture and reflects Jones\u2019s interest in combinations of native and foreign woods.\n\nCurrently on loan to Bodelwyddan Castle, National Portrait Gallery, Rhyl.",

The success of this investment enabled Mason to buy the Eynsham Park estate in 1866. He commissioned extensive building plans and designs for interiors and furniture from Owen Jones and the work was finished shortly before Jones's death in 1874. After Mason's death in 1903, his son James Francis Mason demolished the house and replaced it with a new building, designed by the architect, Ernest George, which was completed in 1908. Jones's silks were apparently rehung in the new library and dining room.\n\nEynsham Hall was used by the Home Office as a police training college from 1946-1981. The dressing table was one of several pieces of furniture from the house given to the Museum in 1954.",
