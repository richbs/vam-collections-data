He has been making jewellery since 1972, achieving dramatic, flamboyant effects by combining the simple, inexpensive materials of mirrored glass fragments and resin. The jewels resemble his sculptural work but in miniature. Although smaller and less bold than much of his jewellery, this is a relatively early piece--resembling a collar--and is distinctive in terms of materials, technique and spontenaiety.",
