But Balthazar Gerbier, an amateur artist, was also a painter of miniatures and the drawing incorporates some aspects of miniature painting, being on vellum (a fine parchment) and using touches of watercolour.\n\nPeople\nGerbier was born in The Netherlands but his early education and training are obscure.  He must have been schooled in the accomplishments necessary for courtiers, particularly a knowledge of 'war-like machines'.  This recommended him to Prince William of Orange, whose service he entered in 1615.  In 1616 he was sent to England to work for the Dutch ambassador, but soon after transferred his service to George Villiers, the Earl, and subsequently Duke, of Buckingham. He became the Duke's domestic architect and adviser on matters of art. In 1628, after Buckingham's assassination, Gerbier transferred formally to the service of Charles I.\n\nHistorical Associations\nThis picture was drawn about 1616, when Gerbier had just arrived in England and Charles was formally invested as Prince of Wales.  The Latin inscription translates as 'Most illustrious and powerful Prince of Great Britain and Ireland, Prince Charles'.  Thus it celebrates the Prince's new standing,  an appropriate subject for an ambitious courtier in the making.",

See also Toynbee 1949, pp.4-9, on the early iconography of Charles I. \n\nAlthough published accounts of Gerbier after Long repeat the supposed dependence of his draughtsmanship on Hendrick Goltzius, the immediate source of the technique and of the classicizing iconography of this miniature lies in the prints of the van de Passes, of Elstrack and Delaram.  Among images of Charles, the analogies point most strongly to a relationship between Gerbier and Simon van de Passe, and the present image seems to fit neatly in a series of the print emerging from the van de Passe workshop which sought to establish Charles in the image of his brother Henry after November 1612.  The Gerbier portrait follows the images of Charles as Duke of York and Knight of the Garter in the second edition of <i>Regiae Anglicae Majestatis Pictura</i> (1) and leads on to that projected in the <i>Baziliwlogia</i>. (2) \n \nAs to date, the present miniature coincides with the portrait used for the first publication of James I's <i>Works of the Most High and Mightie Prince, James\u2026King of Great Britain, France and Ireland\u2026</i>, (3) but differs from it in incorporating the Prince of Wales's feathers gracefully into the titled scrollwork surround instead of awkwardly squeezing them into the niche space behind the head.  Since Charles's investiture as Prince of Wales was in November 1616, Gerbier's portrait must represent one of the first sitting by the Prince with his new title.  \n \nOn the iconography, see also entry for Cat. No. 2. \n \n1 1613, first edition, Cologne 1604; Hind 1955, p. 54, pl. 25. \n2 1618, state 1; Hind 1955, p. 133, pl. 65b. \n3 1616; Hind 1955, p. 254, pl. 150a.\"",
