Many Victorian gentlemen followed the fashion for large moustaches which could be disfigured by food. This special spoon was made with a guard on one side of the bowl to protect the moustache when eating soup. Some of the spoons had detachable guards for general use and examples were made for both right and left handed users.\n\nManufacturers\nThe spoon was manufactured by the  firm of John Round & Son Ltd. They described themselves as 'The largest Spoon and Fork  Makers in the World ' and although their factory was in Sheffield, the main  showrooms  were in London. They made cutlery in electroplated nickel silver (nickel alloy coated with a thin layer of silver  by means of an electric current) as well as silver, and supplied ships, hotels, and clubs as well as the home.",
