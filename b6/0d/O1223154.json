Since the artist has probably cut the original title off from the top sheet and attached it to a support sheet on which he has written the name: 'Ye Old Woodman', it seems likely that he was re-using a design he had done previously for a differently-named character. In an article of 1867 the playwright T.W. Robertson described Dykwynkyn as 'the presiding genius of all theatrical Christmas revels.'\n\nFor his pantomime work Keene used the name Dykwynkyn which he characteristically signed on an artist's palette on the ground. He was also responsible for designs for a number of other lavish productions of the day, and for these he was billed as Mr. R.W. Keene.",
