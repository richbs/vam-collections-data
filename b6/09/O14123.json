The leather-bound volume has a four-page index tipped in. The index is in English and is divided into three sections dealing respectively with elephants, horses and people. This picture illustrates a 'Siamese [Thai] Man and Woman' in their distinctive dress.\n\nIndian artists made Company Paintings for the British in India. They often used devices found in European painting. Schools of Company Painting never really developed in the other areas of south and south-east Asia that came under British influence. Occasionally a British officer might commission a local artist to make drawings especially for him.",
