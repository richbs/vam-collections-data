Oliver and Ray Goldsmith built upon the company\u2019s reputation for attention-grabbing designs and solicited celebrity endorsement for their products. Key clients included Lord Snowdon, the actress Diana Dors, Princess Grace of Monaco and Diana, Princess of Wales.  \n\nA. Oliver Goldsmith created this glasses frame, titled \u2018Polygon\u2019, in 1971, the year that Britain converted its currency to the decimal system. The company registered the design, and received much publicity for its unusual and timely 50-pence shape. This frame was available in virtually every colour, but the clear or \u2018crystal\u2019 shade shown here was especially popular.",
