A putto sits by the tomb holding the INRI scroll, while the crown of thorns hangs over one of the tapering nails from the cross on a rock nearby. A plant is growing near the tomb, beside St. Mary Magdalene's pot of ointment. The ladder and foot of the cross are visible at the upper left, and angels and cherubim hover in the sky above.",

            "public_access_description": "Throughout the ages artists and craftsmen have made virtuoso carvings as a display of their skill and ingenuity. Although ivory, wood and stone are relatively easy to carve, other materials such as gemstones are much more demanding. Most of these carvings were made for wealthy patrons and collectors, who delighted in the rarity of the material and quality of the carving. Balthasar Permoser(1651-1732) was famous for his monumental sculpture, but he also worked on a more intimate scale. He was among the foremost sculptors of the late Baroque period in Germany. This ivory exemplifies his sensitive carving, in particular the swooning Virgin falling away from the figure of the dead Christ. The concave top of the relief reflects the shape of the ivory tusk. In terms of subject matter, he executed both profoundly religious works, and elegant pieces of a purely secular nature. He trained initially in Salzburg and in 1671 went to Vienna, where he is likely to have studied ivory carving. He visited Rome in 1674-5, and in about 1677 entered the service of the Medici in Florence in the sculpture workshops run by Giovanni Battista Foggini (1652-1725). Some of his ivory figure groups were later reproduced in porcelain by the Doccia, F\u00fcrstenberg and Meissen manufactories. In 1690 he moved to Dresden to work at the court of the Elector of Saxony, and remained there for the rest of his life, apart from a spell in Berlin, where he collaborated with Andreas Schl\u00fcter (c. 1659-1714) on the Berliner Schloss.",

According to Museum records, The Entombment was purchased by Hildburgh from the Munich dealer Julius B\u00f6hler in 1930 on the recommendation of the Museum. Shortly after its purchase, it was published as being by Balthasar Permoser, best known for his monumental sandstone figures executed between 1712 and 1723 for the Dresden Zwinger, the richly decorated court building designed for Augustus the Strong (1670-1733), elector of Saxony. Like many German sculptors, he also produced small-scale sculpture, and this ivory is thought to have been produced early in his career, soon after the sculptor had gone to work in Florence in 1677. The attribution to Permoser was subsequently disregarded; it is only relatively recently that Permoser has once again been accepted as the carver of this piece.\n\nLit.
