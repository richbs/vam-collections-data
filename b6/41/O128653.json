In 1862 this order became an Order of Merit awarded to Portuguese and foreigners for achievement or noted service in the fields of science, literature and the arts. This star of the Order was awarded to John Charles Robinson (1824-1913), curator, scholar and collector, who worked at the V&A in its earliest days and was a very important figure in the formation of the collections. Its central gold medallion bears a red enamelled badge of the Order of Sant' Iago on a white background, with an inscription round it which reads 'SCIENCIAS LETRAS E ARTES' (Science, literature and the arts).",
