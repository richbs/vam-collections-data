At this time potters in Iznik in Turkey were using a variety of coloured slips (liquid clay) to cover the bodies of their wares. They then added detailed designs in slips of contrasting colours and paint.\n\nThe Ottoman court renewed its patronage of Iznik ceramics during the construction of the S\u00fcleymaniye mosque in Istanbul in 1550\u20131557. The first Iznik tiles were produced, and potters added a bright red to the range of colours painted under the glaze using a special liquid clay.\n\nIn the following decades, Iznik potter decorated high-quality tiles in red, green and tones of blue on a white ground. Dishes, bottles and other vessels had similar decoration on white or coloured grounds.",
