From surviving notes, it appears that Messel envisaged the ballet opening with a spectacular procession, incorporating folk and mythological figures; it would close with an Apotheosis showing Elizabeth I as Queen of the Past, handing on the orb to Elizabeth II as Queen of the Present, before leaving her 'surrounded with all the virtues and gifts.'  Then 'in the air above their heads a vision far away of a youthful Brittania ... riding in a triumphal Chariot barge in the clouds which at the same time looks like the sea & the barge is drawn by a lion & unicorn who have become amphibius (sic) creatures.'  \n\nWhat Messel wanted, in fact, was nothing less than a 17th century Jacobean court masque in the manner of Inigo Jones. Such lavish, fantastical designs would have cost more than his sets and costumes for the main ballet, so on stage the procession of homage was reduced to a simple entry for the queens of the four elements - Earth, Water, Fire and Air - and their attendants and, after the ballet, an apotheosis when the spirit of Elizabeth I passes the orb to Elizabeth II. \n\nGreat Britain\u2019s leading theatre designer from the early 1930s to the mid 1950s, Oliver Messel (1904-1978) won international acclaim for his lavish, painterly and poetic designs informed by period styles.  His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.",

Messel, inspired by Jacobean court masques and the designs of Inigo Jones, envisaged an entr\u00e9e in the form of an elaborate procession, including mythological figures and characters from folklore, and an Apotheosis in which Elizabeth I hands on the orb to Elizabeth II, who is then transformed into a symbol of virtue; for the Apotheosis, he produced this design of a youthful Britannia in a chariot drawn over the waves by the Lion and Unicorn.   Neither elaborate procession nor Apotheosis were realised in this form.  \nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's theatre designs and other designs and artefacts.  The designs were briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being housed at the V&A from 1981 on indefinite loan.  The V&A Theatre Museum purchased the Oliver Messel collection from Lord Snowdon in 2005.",
