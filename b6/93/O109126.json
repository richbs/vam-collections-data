He was the father-in-law of the painter Dalmasio de\u2019 Scannabecchi and was elected a member of the Elderly for the Porta San Procolo district in 1380. Very little is known about his work.\n\nThis casket is lavishly decorated with various saints and scenes from the life of St John the Baptist. It is characteristic of Gothic painting done in Bologna around 1350, and it was probably made for a member of the Baisi family of Bologna who was a bishop or priest. The same coat of arms is painted at both ends of the lid, and emblazoned with a bishop\u2019s mitre and crozier, and with the crossed keys of St Peter.",

The quality of the painting is clearly inferior to that of Simone's own work (Sandberg-Vavala, op. cit.), but it is sufficiently close in style to indicate that the casket may well have been produced in his workshop in the second half of the rath century. \nThe arms repeated on both ends of the lid (three fishes in pale) are probably those of the Baisi family of Bologna; the mitre, cross keys and crozier added in chief indicate that the casket belonged to an ecclesiastical member of the family. \n\n<i>Prov,</i> Bought for \u00a320 from Delange, Paris, in 1864. \n<i>Lit.</i> P.

Delange of Paris in 1863 for \u00a320.\n\nPASTIGLIA BOXES\nGilt <i>pastiglia</i> boxes were mostly made in Venice and Ferrara from about 1480 until 1550. <i>Pastiglia</i> or <i>pasta</i> is the name given to white lead paste, bound with egg white. This was often scented and described in contemporary inventories as <i>pasta di muschio</i> (musk paste). The <i>pastiglia</i> figures and motifs were shaped with a lead mould and then glued to the gilt surface of the box - hence their frequent recurrence on other boxes. The boxes are decorated with legends of Ancient Rome and the scenes copied from woodcuts such as Jacobus Argentoratensis' <i>Triumph of Caesar</i> (Venice, 1504) or illustrations of Livy's <i>Roman History</i>.\n(Label text, circa 2000, from old Medieval & Renaissance Galleries)\n\nHistorical significance: Originally acquired as Florentine, this casket has been attributed to Simone dei Crocefissi by John Pope-Hennessy (oral communication), an attribution supported by Peter Thornton (1984). \nCharacteristically shaped like a Medieval Italian tomb, this casket shows on a gilded background with eroded pastiglia work the half-length figures of the apostles (St Peter, St John the Evangelist, St Bartholomew, St Matthew) and two unknown saints as well as the four evangelists, St Christopher, St Anthony Abbot and St Liberius. On each ends are three apostles with a coat of arms: three fishes in pale, probably those of the Baisi family of Bologna while the mitre, cross keys and crosier allude to a high clerical charge such as bishop. \nCaskets were part of the medieval household to store precious items such as books and papers but may also have had an ecclesiastical use by storing bibles, small liturgical utensils and even reliquaries. The present casket was probably indeed decorated according to an ecclesiastical purpose. \nThe figures of the saints bear the characteristic features of Simone dei Crocefissi\u2019s output. Many works, preserved in the Pinacoteca Nazionale, Bologna, can be compared with the present works, especially a <i>Crucifixion of Christ</i> from ca. 1370 (Inv. 286). This <i>Crucifixion</i> displays very similar figures, perhaps more refined, whose features are strongly outlined with a heavy black line. \nIts decoration would have made it a rare and much prized item. The owner was most likely from Bologna, a city that had a flourishing school of illuminators and miniaturists, such as Andrea da Bologna (fl. 1370s) and the presumed author of the present decoration Simone dei Crocifissi. At this time and until the High Renaissance, decorating furniture was as much part of an artist\u2019s activity as painting altar-pieces and illuminating manuscripts.",

            "historical_context_note": "A casket is a very small case or lidded box for storing various objects and were popular from the 4th century AD. Usually made of ivory or wood, caskets were used for storing important books and papers, liturgical utensils and various precious items. They were utilised by both the secular and the ecclesiastic worlds, For example, bible boxes were used by both ecclesiastic and lay owners for storing Bibles. They were particularly common in the Renaissance and made of wood, usually walnut or oak, with either a flat or a slanting hinged lid. Somehow they can be seen as the precursor of the much larger Italian <i>cassone</i> and were most of the time lavishly decorated.",
