ISBN 1851773088.\nThese crisply carved capitals were among a group of twenty-one acquired as examples of Renaissance ornament. Like the casts from Santa Maria de' Miracoli (cat.24), they illustrate the way in which the Museum's concern to assemble a repertory of decorative motifs made ornamental, nonfigurative carving a significant element within the collection of sculpture. J. C. Robinson had always advocated \"a systematic collection of medieval and renaissance sculpture\" in view of its \"intimate connection\" with the decorative arts. This was to include \"auxiliary illustrations\", such as prints and photographs, and especially plaster casts. In Robinson's view however, there was no substitute for original artworks; casts were to be selected only to fill gaps in a series. Since the opening of the Aston Webb extension in 1909, these capitals have been shown in various settings alongside some larger works of architectural sculpture.\nThe capitals came from the Rocca Roveresca di Mondolfo (destroyed 1864-1895) near Sinigallia in the Marches, central Italy. It is thought that this stronghold was built between 1483 and 1490 and designed, at least in part, by the painter, sculptor, architect and engineer Francesco di Giorgio Martini for Giovanni della Rovere, whose coat of arms appears on one of the capitals. The capitals were bought in London in 1878 from Robinson himself, who had \"selected all the fine specimens\" of architectural fragments from the Rocca and offered them to the Museum. In 1887 he presented another seventeen to the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery.\n\nLit.
