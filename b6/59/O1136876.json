The text is as follows: SCHOOL UNKNOWN: mid 16th century 520 A frieze of figures, with a dog and a prancing goat, taking part in a bacchanal ro witches\u2019 abbath Reed pen 14 \u00be x 10 1/8 (374 x 257) Dyce 176 PROVENANCE Dyce Bequest 1869 LITERATURE <i>Dyce Catalogue</i> no. 176 (as anonymous, ascribed to Rosso Fiorentino) The drawing is not by Bandinelli; but thought it has been much discussed (orally rather than in print), no other convincing attribution has been proposed: nor is it easy to assign the drawing to a particular school. The anonymous artist is sometimes known as the Master of the Victoria and Albert Museum Diableries. There are other similar drawings by him, showing the same macabre taste, notable no. 520 in this catalogue; 1955-7-22-2 in the British Museum; a sheet in the collection of Mr Janos Scholz, New York; and another in the collection of Mr Iam Woodner, New York (illustrated under no. 16 in the Catalogue quoted). A witches\u2019 Sabbath, somewhat similar to the scenes shown in our two drawings, is the theme of a well-known engravcing, known as Lo Stregozzo, by Marcantonio Raimondi, Paris, 1888, p. 204, no. 175). There, too, the skeleton of a monster takes part in the action.",
