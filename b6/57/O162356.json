Mexico City and Puebla became the centres for ceramic production. Initially Mexican tin-glazed ceramics were strongly influenced by Spanish maiolica pottery.\nIn 1565 Spain established a new trade from China to compete with Portuguese merchants. Cargoes of Chinese porcelain were shipped across the Pacific Ocean to Mexico, where they were carried overland via Puebla before being shipped on to Spain. These Chinese exports strongly influenced local potters, who combined Chinese blue-and-white decorative schemes with local motifs.\nThe central decoration of the crowned double-headed eagle probably refers to the Habsburg dynasty who ruled Spain until 1700, but the eagle also had a strong local significance in Mexico dating back from Aztec times.",

Although the double-headed eagle was removed from the Spanish royal arms during the reign of Philip II, it reappears as a symbol on seventeenth and eighteenth century Spanish and colonial monstrances, inspired by the devotion of the Spanish monarchy to the sacrament of the Eucharist and by their imperial heritage. The double-headed eagle with an Imperial crown appears on the engraved frontispiece of a religious work dedicated to Philip IV, Francisco Aguado's <u>Svmo Sacramento de la Fe, Tesoro del nombre christiano</u> (Madrid: Francisco Mart\u00ednez, 1640).

This is a clear indication that this type of vessel was also used in an ecclesiastical context, specifically in this case to wash the fine white linen cloth used at the Eucharist for wiping the chalice and paten, and the fingers and lips of the celebrant. The person who ordered it, however, found it necessary to add a warning '... and no more' to prevent the same vessel from being used for more general purposes.\n\nThere is another Puebla basin at the V&amp;A (C.66-1947: D. 46 cm H. 17 cm) which has a male, possibly Chinese, figure looking through a telescope. \n\nIn the collection of the V&amp;A are also two early 18th-century Spanish (Valencia) examples: 2-1907: (D. 47 cm H. 16.5 cm); 348-1893: (D. 48 cm H. 17.7 cm).  All seem to be of more or less similar size with diameters between 47 and 55 cm and heights of about 17 cm.",
