Easily portable, it would be placed on a table and the writer or reader would stand in front of it.  The interior of this example was originally fitted with a nest of eight drawers (four are now missing).  These would have been used to store pens, paper and other writing materials.  A moulded ledge on the desk lid prevented books and paper from slipping.\n\nUse\nAn engraved portrait in the V&A of the poet Sir Thomas Overbury (1613) by Renold Elstracke shows him leaning on such a table desk with his left arm. He  writes his own epitaph with his right hand,  the paper overlapping the top of the desk.  A small inkpot is positioned to the right of the paper.  The presence of ink stains on the top ledge of this desk suggests that it was used in a similar way.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe side, front and back of the desk are inlaid with designs of buildings. This type of inlaid decoration took its name from Henry VIII's Palace of Nonsuch near Ewell in Surrey, built between 1538 and 1547  [demolished in 1682].  It is associated with so-called Nonsuch chests. Fanciful buildings with pinnacles and towers framed by bands of classical bead and reel ornament are typical features of Nonsuch decoration.",
