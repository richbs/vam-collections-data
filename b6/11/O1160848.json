He studied at the Slade and in Paris, but abandoned painting for theatre design in the  1930s, becoming well known for his settings and costumes for plays, ballets and films. Furse  was particularly associated with the work of Laurence Olivier, for whom he designed the films of  Henry V , Hamlet , Richard III  and The Prince and the Showgirl , and he frequently worked for the  Old Vic, designing Shakespeare productions which starred some of the great names of British  theatre. \n\nRoger Furse won the 1948 Academy Award for Best Costume Design for a Black and White Film for his designs for Hamlet. This was the first year that an award had been made for costume design and the category was divided into two,with one award been given for a black and white film and one for colour.",
