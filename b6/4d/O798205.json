There is no panel in the House of Lords to John de Stapleton, who has not been identified. Moreover the heraldry does not correspond with any listed under Stapleton. These are preliminary designs for the heraldic panels which decorate the cove beneath the gallery of the House of Lords. However the panels were executed without scrolls giving names and with a plain gold background.\n\nAugustus Welby Northmore Pugin (1812-52) is widely considered as one of the most significant and influential architects, designers and theorists of the 19th century. Following his conversion to Catholicism in 1835, he identified the Gothic style with Christian architecture and his work and writings inspired and framed the Gothic Revival. In 'Contrasts', published in 1836, he condemned classical forms and ardently praised 14th and 15th-century architecture. Pugin is best remembered for his work on the Palace of Westminster.",
