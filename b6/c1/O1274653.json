It was given to the museum in 2010 when Westminster Council upgraded all its signposts as part of its Legible London campaign.  \n\nThe name Shaftesbury Avenue conjures associations of a century of theatre-going in London's West End, with the Lyric, Apollo, Gielgud and Queen's Theatres on the north side between Piccadilly Circus and Charing Cross Road, the Palace Theatre at the intersection of Shaftesbury Avenue and Charing Cross Road, and the Shaftesbury Theatre at its north-eastern end. Shaftesbury Avenue has been at the heart of London's West End theatre district since the late 19th century when it was built by the architect George Vuillamy and the engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette, clearing the slums of St. Giles and Soho and creating a traffic artery through the area. It was named after the politician and philanthropist Anthony Ashley Cooper (1801-1885), the 7th Earl of Shaftesbury of whom it was said by one of his biographers that: 'No man has in fact ever done more to lessen the extent of human misery or to add to the sum total of human happiness.'",
