The artwork for this album did not include the Sex Pistols' name and as the film wasn't released until a year after the soundtrack album, the album wouldn't have any other immediate way of identifying as part of the Sex Pistols phenomenon. The stickers' design even closely follows the previous album's aesthetic, mimicking the fluourescent colours and ransom-note style, which the artwork for The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle had moved away from.\n\nJamie Reid's cut-and-paste aesthetic, as seen on this poster, developed from his interest in radical politics. His artistic style developed while at art college in Croydon, where he was influenced by the ideas of the avant-garde political group, the Situationist International. The political slant to his art was aroused by the May 1968 Paris student riots, which inspired fraternal protests organised by Reid at the Croydon College of Art. These were directed with fellow student Malcolm McLaren, who would later become the manager of the Sex Pistols.",
