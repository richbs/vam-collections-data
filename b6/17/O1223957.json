Their hats found great popularity on Broadway and in Hollywood. In 1948 Mr John established his own millinery salon on 57th street New York. He continued to create dramatic and fantastic hats until his retirement in 1970.\nThis hat came from the 1977 sale of the personal effects of the American performer Gypsy Rose Lee who was a great client of Mr John.",
