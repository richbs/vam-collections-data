It  would impress guests as evidence of the owner's knowledgeable and artistic taste.The vase was made at a time when a market for Turkish art wares was beginning to be established.\n\nDesign & Designing\nUnder their art director, L\u00e9on Arnoux (1816-1902), Minton's were interested in design and ceramic technology of many periods and cultures. Turkish (Iznik) wares were one of several types that attracted the company's attention.  Other manufactories, notably in France, also imitated this brightly coloured ware. Minton's Managing Director, Colin Minton Campbell (1827-1885), purchased Persian (Iranian) tiles in Paris and Istanbul in 1856-8.  He formed a collection of East Asian and Middle Eastern ceramics and  contemporary wares from other European manufactories which was held at the factory, providing examples for the designers and technicians to study. Minton's was the only British company to take such care in the research and replication of historic techniques and designs.\n\nHistorical Association\nIn the 1860s tin-glazed ceramics with this characteristic patterning and colours were thought to have been made by potters in Rhodes.  Their correct attribution to the Iznik region was not made until the 1940s.",
