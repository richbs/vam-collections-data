The D'Oyly Carte company continued to produce and tour Gilbert and Sullivan operettas in their traditional style, even after Gilbert's death in 1911, right up until 1982.\n\nJohn Hassall, the designer, was one of the most influential British poster artists of the early 20th century. His style, incorporating flat areas of colour enclosed by thick black lines, was influenced by the Japanese woodcut, the poster artist Alphonse Mucha and the Art Nouveau style. His career started in 1890, when he became a regular contributor to The Graphic magazine. He began designing theatre posters when he joined the advertising company David Allen & Sons, in 1895, with whom he worked for over 50 years.",
