The cupboards on either side provide storage space. The shaped top lifts up on brass quadrants (supports) to reveal a velvet-lined tray, possibly used for the display of medals or coins.\n\nHistorical Associations\nThis cabinet was  first shown at the Arts and Crafts Exhibition of 1889 where mixed reviews included the comment that it looked like an 'exaggerated inlaid tea-caddy on a clumsy stand'. Despite this it became quite a popular design for Morris & Co., the company owned by William Morris. It was still available around 1912 in the firm's catalogue, priced at 98 guineas for a version with decorative marquetry, or at 60 guineas for plainer examples.\n\nPeople\nGeorge Jack supplied furniture design for Morris & Co. from about 1880 and succeeded Philip Webb as chief furniture designer from 1890. He favoured the use of native timbers and the revival of marquetry techniques to embellish furniture, as this piece illustrates.\n\nMaterials & Making\nMorris & Co. took over the Pimlico workshops of Holland & Co., a large well-established firm of cabinet-makers, in about 1890.This cabinet illustrates the technical expertise and quality of the workmanship associated with experienced cabinet-makers.",

Purchased from the Trustees of the Middlemore Estates, London.\n\nThe cabinet was presumably ordered from Morris & Co. by Thomas and Theodosia Middlemore for their new house at Melstetter. The house was finished in 1900 and the Middlemores commissioned furnishings from Morris & Co (three tapestries are now in Birmingham Museum).  Photographs of Melsetter taken in 1944-5, after Theodosia's death in 1940, show the secretaire in the drawing room, against the panelled wall which has an arched niche at right angles to the window. Copies of the photographs are in the Orkney Library and Archives, Kirkwall.",

            "historical_context_note": "An example of the cabinet was first shown at the Arts and Crafts exhibition of 1889 where mixed reviews included the comment that it looked like an 'exaggerated inlaid tea-caddy on a clumsy stand'. Despite this, it became a popular design for Morris & Co.and was advertised in the firm's catalogue c.1912, priced at 98 guineas for a version with decorative marquetry or at 60 guineas for plainer examples.\n\nOther examples of the cabinet were acquired by Lawrence Hodson of Compton Hall (owner of the St. George's Cabinet), by W.K.d'Arcy for Stanmore Hall and by the Christie family for Tapeley Hall, Devon (two slightly different versions still in situ, 1994). The example acquired by Ralph Radcliffe-Whitehead for his American Arts and Crafts community is now in the Philadelphia Museum of Art.\n\nAnother example of the cabinet was bought from Morris & Co. in 1908 for 98 guineas by Theodora, wife of the 4th Marquess of Bristol, for Ickworth. This example, which had been on loan at Ickworth, was accepted in lieu of inheritance tax in 2005, and allocated to the National Trust.\n\nSome of the surviving examples of the cabinet include a number following the firm's name and address stamped on the edge of the fall front. The V&A cabinet is stamped 1147, the version in the Philadelphia Museum 664, and the one at Ickworth 1581. If these numbers were used consecutively, it suggests that the V&A cabinet may have been made shortly before the Ickworth example in 1908.",
