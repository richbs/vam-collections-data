He participated to the first 'Salon des Refus\u00e9s', which took place in Fran\u00e7ois Bonvin's (1817-1887) atelier in 1859, where he befriended Corot. He had a short career and died at the early age of 37. A retrospective exhibition of his oeuvre took place at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in 1876.\n\nThis is a fine example of Guillaume R\u00e9gamey art he devoted almost entirely to the depiction of horses and horsemen. This painting shows an Algerian sentinel leaning against a tree in a sunny landscape. The bright albeit golden light and the earthen palette are typical of the Orientalist movement, a branch of Realism which favoured subjects inspired by distant settings of the Middle East.",

            "history_note": "Perhaps the work exhibited in 1869 at the R.A. under the title 'Sur le terrain conquis: sentinelle de tirailleurs Alg\u00e9riens' (n. 333). Purchased  by Constantine Alexander Ionides for \u00a360 (his inventory, private collection), probably directly from the artist (as for CAI 71 and 73, bought around 1873). Bequeathed by Constantine Alexander Ionides, 1900\n\nHistorical significance: This painting is a fine example of R\u00e9gamey\u2019s art and shows an Algerian sentinel leaning against a tree in a sunny landscape. The golden sunlight and earthern palette is typical of the Orientalist which combines some Romantic elements (the lone figure presented as a <i>pensieroso</i>) with a Naturalist approach. The figure represents a \u2018spahi\u2019, a French Colonial soldier from North Africa, primarily recruited from the indigenous populations of Algeria.\nAlthough it does not seem to have been in Africa, R\u00e9gamey did many sketches and compositions of Arabs horsemen, probably after other artists\u2019 designs. His visual memory was said to be considerable and enabled him to recreate details and compositional formulas in his atelier.\nThis painting was probably commissioned by Constantine Alexander Ionides, whom R\u00e9gamey had probably met through the intermediary of Legros during the winter 1870-71 in London. At that time, R\u00e9gamey was sharing Legros\u2019 studio in London and collaborating to the <i>Illustrated London News</i>. It was perhaps the work exhibited in 1869 at the Royal Academy, London, under the title <i>Sur le terrain conquis: sentinelle de tirailleurs Alg\u00e9riens</i> (n. 333).",

            "historical_context_note": "19th-century French art is marked by a succession of movements based on a more or less close relationship with nature. At the beginning of the century, Romantic artists were fascinated by nature they interpreted as a mirror of the mind. They investigated human nature and personality, the folk culture, the national and ethnic origins, the medieval era, the exotic, the remote, the mysterious and the occult. This movement was heralded in France by such painter as Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix (1798-1863). In its opposition to academic art and its demand for a modern style Realism continued the aims of the Romantics. They assumed that reality could be perceived without distortion or idealization, and sought after a mean to combine the perception of the individual with objectivity. This reaction in French painting against the Grand Manner is well represented by Gustave Courbet (1819-1877) who wrote a 'Manifesto of Realism', entitled <i>Le R\u00e9alisme</i> published in Paris in 1855. These ideas were challenged by the group of the Barbizon painters, who formed a recognizable school from the early 1830s to the 1870s and developed a free, broad and rough technique. They were mainly concerned by landscape painting and the rendering of light. The works of Narcisse Virgile Diaz de la Pe\u00f1a (1807-1876), Jules Dupr\u00e9 (1811-1889), Th\u00e9odore Rousseau (1812-1867), Constant Troyon (1810-1865) and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet (1814-1875) anticipate somehow  the <i>plein-air</i> landscapes of the Impressionists.",
