(some col.).\nExhibition catalogue\n<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, pp. 233, 237-238\nThe following is an extract from the text of the entry:\n \n\u201cThe canvas has not been relined, and is on the original stretcher. \n\nNo. 403 [141-1888] has long been taken to be a sketch for 'The Valley Farm' (see Nos. 373 and 374 [143-1888, 140-1888]) and the inscription on the back of the sketch gave this the force of a family tradition. But Shirley (L. ed, S., pp. 325-6) pointed out that this identification was very doubtful. The farmhouse--which is not Willy Lott's house--is seen from an entirely different viewpoint, the main group of trees is in the centre and not on the right, the composition is horizontal, not vertical, and the only point of similarity is in the two figures in the boat in the foreground. In fact, as C. H. Collins Baker has shown in his article 'The Kennedy Memorial Gallery' (<i>Connoisseur</i>, Vol. CXXXIV, 1954, pp. 142-4), this is one of a group of four compositions of a different character by Constable, of which the final stage is perhaps seen in the painting 'On the Stour, Willy Lott's House' in the Kennedy Memorial Gallery, Los Angeles (reproduced in colour, Collins Baker, loc. cit.). The other versions are: \ni The water-colour No. 1888-2-15-33 in the British Museum (reproduced in Sir J. D. Linton, <i>Constable's Sketches in Oil and Watercolours</i>, 1905, p. 60). \nii The oil painting 'On the Stour' (23 x 30 1/2 ins.) in the Phillips Memorial \nGallery, Washington, D.C. (reproduced in Collins Baker, loc. cit.). \nThere is no conclusive external evidence for the dating of this series, but i and ii above, as well as No. 403 [141-1888], are clearly late works. Shirley (loc. cit.) suggests that No. 403 [141-1888] may be connected with the picture which Constable was meditating when he wrote to Leslie on 8 September 1834: \"I shall put off Worcester-I hope to be better employed for I have almost determined to attack another canal for my large frame\" (P. Leslie, p. 129). He dates accordingly c.1834. This date is certainly to be preferred on grounds of style to that of c.1825 adopted by Collins Baker for the version in the Kennedy Memorial Gallery which he regards as the latest of the series. The method of painting and tonality have much in common with the sketches for 'The Valley Farm', Nos. 373 [143-1888] and 374 [140-1888]. It may be that the originating idea for the composition is to be found in the slight full-page sketch in the sketch-book No. 132 [1259-1888], p. 69, but the details are too vague for this to be advanced with any assurance.\u201d",
