By the 1820s they had become more elaborate and sometimes embossed, and within a decade both the printing and embossing processes were automated. They were colour printed by chromolithography, and coated with a gelatine and gum layer to give them a gloss finish. After being embossed they were die-cut and put through a stamping press to cut away the unwanted areas of paper, leaving the individual images connected by small strips, often bearing the name or initials of the maker.\n\nScraps became extremely popular in Victorian England to be cut out by adults or children and stuck into albums, on to screens, or used for decorating greetings cards. This shows a music hall 'swell' or dandy a man-about town sporting whiskers made famous by the actor E.A. Southern as Lord Dundreary, a character he played in 1861.It is part of a set showing roller skating, a popular pastime after 1876 when the Englishman William Brown patented a design in Birmingham for four-wheeled roller skates.",
