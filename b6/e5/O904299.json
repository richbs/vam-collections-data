Its is bound in mottled covers, and is endorsed inside the cover in ink : \n\n<i>T. M. &amp; Co.  Carta No. 3322.\nQuesto libro \u00e8 d'un excellente fabbricante M. &amp; Co.\n</i>\nTwo things seem clear from this, first that T. M. &amp; Co, were the initials of the English house ; and second that a pretty big edition was published, for No. 3322 would hardly refer to the recipient's library of trade catalogues.   The costumes help to fix the period as Georgian.   There are a doze or so engravings of horses, not well drawn, but full of vigour and action.  One or two carriages are out-line to show what constituted a suite of fitting, the cost of which, plated, ranged round 9<i>l</i>. and 10<i>l</i>.   Harness mounts, buckles, egg-shaped springs threaded on bolts between plates, pole ends (guarde d'effien), axle caps, and coach ironwork are comprehensively dealt with.   Harness was \" 38<i>s</i>. plated all over,\" or \" 21<i>s</i>. with the sides left for covering with leather.\"   Buckles, if sent with \" The ends of the Tongs plated,\" were 1<i>s</i>. per dozen over the prices.   \" Terretts \" were supplied with several kinds of sockets, and with blinker roses could be fitted with armorial crests.   The leather work for saddles and bridles is capitally rendered, and shows that heavy ornamentation with metal was fashionable.   On one plate the engraver drops English and Italian and breaks out in French--\" Toute la Garniture pourra se faire semblable.\"   <i>See illustration, plate XIV.</i>\"",
