To prepare the ink some water would have been applied to the well at the end of ink stone by the water dropper. The ink stick would then be carefully dipped in the water and then slowly but firmly ground against the rough edge of the ink stone. Seen as a careful and meditative process, ink preparation took a while and was finished only when the consistency of the ink reached the desired thickness. This left ample time for the individual to admire the box. Such writing boxes had been utilised since the 12th century but it was during the Edo period that they became a large scale surface for lacquer decoration.",
