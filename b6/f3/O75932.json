The west wing was built around 1730. This design is a very simplified version of a Chinese wallpaper. These so-called 'flowering tree' Chinese wallpapers were imported into Britain from the late 1600s. They became very fashionable, and English wallpaper manufacturers made many imitations. The original Chinese papers were hand-painted. However, the English manufacturer printed this wallpaper in blocks of stencilled colour to resemble the embroidered panels and bed hangings of the late 1600s.",
