The skirt is embroidered with stylized flowers and foliage worked in solid blocks of narrow silk cord; with, at centre top, a larger flower of pale scarlet cord, set with tiny gold thread cord whorly, the stem and surrounding leaves of black silk cord.  Attached above the hem is a deep pleated frill of ivory satin, each pleat with a tiny button covered in dull scarlet satin at the lower right corner.  The join to the skirt is concealed by a bold box-pleated ruche, centered with a narrow gold tinsel-woven braid set with a row of tiny dull scarlet satin-covered buttons.  Attached at the waist, reaching to just above the hem ruche, is an open-fronted overskirt of ivory satin with the lower front edges cut on a curve.  The sides of the overskirt are gathered up and fixed over the hips to give the pannier effect. The overskirt is embroidered all-over with machine satin stitch and solid chain stitch meandering foliage and stylized flowers each individual in shape.  The overskirt is edged with the same box-pleated ruche as the underskirt.  The skirt is lined with off-white artificial silk.  The skirt is fixed onto a petersham waistband, which fastens at the back with hooks and eyes, with press studs down the back opening.\n[Theatre costume] Bodice of scarlet satin with pointed lower edge to front with a front V-shaped panel from neck to lower edge.  The front panel is edged with a box-pleated ruche of ivory satin, whcih continues around the neck; on the panel are appliqued bold gold satin and white satin chevrons, edged in narrow lines of black satin; above the panel is a small 'modesty vest' of pleated white chiffon.  The short sleeves are finished in a double flounce of white satin with scalloped edges, short at the front and longer at the back, above which is a black satin band finished in a bold stitched bow.  The bodice is boned down the front panel and at the back. The costume fastens down the back with hooks and eyes.  Either side of the back opening is a small buttonhole stitched opening.",

His original design places the dress on a little plinth, reminiscent of a Meissen figurine, which is an indication to the maker of the effect he wished to achieve.  The maker has executed the floral design in machine embroidery, using pale shades, and achieving something of the delicacy of Meissen porcelain.  \nHowever, different makers will have different ways of achieving their effects, and The Theatre Museum owns another version of this dress, in which the decorations on the underskirt are cut from American cloth, a highly glazed cotton, and appliqued onto the skirt, which gives a much bolder and harder effect.   \nIn the 1920s, there was no specialist training for theatre designers, and many productions were designed by artists whose main experience was in illustration and design.  George Sheringham studied art at the Slade School and in Paris, before making his reputation as an illustrator, notably for books by Conan Doyle and Max Beerbohm.  This led to various theatrical commissions for both drama and ballet.",
