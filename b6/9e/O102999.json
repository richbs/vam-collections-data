            "public_access_description": "The Omega Workshops were founded in 1913 by the designer and painter Roger Fry (1866-1934).  He brought together a group of artists to design furniture, pottery, glass, textiles and entire schemes of interior decoration.  Their radically abstract  style, typified by this textile, was far ahead of its time and was influenced by developments in contemporary painting.In keeping with the painting tradition, Fry believed that designs should not be too mechanical and should show evidence of the artist's hand.  In his hand-knotted rugs, such irregularity is created in this case by painting or printing parts of the fabric after weaving. \n\nThe design for this piece was found in Vanessa Bell's studio after her death. It was one of four or five made for Lady Hamilton who was a patron of the avant-garde in London.She offered the Omega artists their only real opportunity to create a harmonised domestic decoration project, including marquetried furniture, mosaic and stained glass.",
