Some of the pages have die-cut serrated edges, like sharp teeth, whilst other pages are designed to look serrated, adding to an overall sense of aggression and confusion. An unsettling array of photographs depicting abstract shapes, scenes of disaster, leering faces and curiously banal objects have been digitally manipulated to create a bewildering onslaught of imagery. On each page a single line of text slices through the maelstrom of shapes and colours.\n\nThe first half of the book lists a contrary set of emotional states and physical symptoms suggestive of someone suffering under the pressures of life, before coming to the conclusion, 'Stress has you by the throat'. The second half of the book seeks answers, a series of conditional ideas to relieve stress are followed by the words, 'everything would be okay'. The repetition of these forms of expression becomes a soothing mantra, before coming to the ultimate conclusion, 'Whatever doesn't kill you makes you strong'.",
