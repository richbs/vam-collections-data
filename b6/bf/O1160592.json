            "public_access_description": "The Prince of Wales' Theatre Richmond was designed by the architect Frank Matcham (1854-1920) and opened in 1899 as the Theatre Royal and Opera House, Richmond.  In 1903 the name was changed to the Prince of Wales' Theatre.  Subsequently it was renamed the Richmond Theatre (1905), the Richmond Hippodrome and Theatre (1908), the Richmond Hippodrome (1913) and, finally, the Richmond Theatre (1924 to the present day).\n\nF. R. Benson (1858-1939) was an actor-manager, performing in and managing his own theatrical company. His full name was Frank Robert Benson.  While studying at Oxford University he was a member of the Oxford University Dramatic Society (OUDS).  His first employment in the professional theatre was in the company managed by Henry Irving (1838-1905) at the Lyceum Theatre, London, which he joined in 1882.  In 1883 he formed his own company, touring throughout the United Kingdom and specialising in plays by William Shakespeare (1564-1616).  He was knighted in 1916 for services to the Theatre.",
