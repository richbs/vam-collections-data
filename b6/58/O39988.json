Stereographs were placed in the holder and then adjusted until the viewer saw the three dimensional effect. The strereograph is made from two photographs of the same subject taken from slightly different angles. An illusion of perspective and depth is achieved when the two images combine as seen through the stereoscope.\n\nMaterials & Making\nVarious types of stereoscopes were devised in the 19th century. This particular hand-held variety, based on a design by the inventor Oliver Wendell Holmes, was perhaps the most readily available and the simplest.",
