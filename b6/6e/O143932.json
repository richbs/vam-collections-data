Talbot's photographic discoveries of the late 1830s through Talbot's friends and relations who lived near Jones in South Wales. Subsequently, Jones became one of the few Britons to produce a substantial body of calotypes in Britain and abroad. His work stands out in the early development of photography because of his ability to fuse his technical skill with the influence of his training as a watercolorist.\n\nIn 1853, Jones moved to Belgium. It is likely that he crossed the Channel from Newhaven to Boulogne, the location of this view. High buildings on either side of the photograph frame the street and market place. The image is dominated by the towering 12th century belfry, its massive structure accentuated by deep shadow on one facet and the strong modelling of the turret and window arches nearest to the viewer.",
