This film is a lesson on national integration. It tells the story of a family whose members come from different states of India. This difference is manifested through the colour of their skin, and the film booklet cover shows a dark-skinned woman surrounded by a number of fair-skinned ones. The back cover of the booklet advertises the next film to be released by the same director.",
