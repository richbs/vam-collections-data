The story goes that on 15 December 1979 the two friends got together for a game of Scrabble but found that some of the pieces were missing. They decided to invent their own game and the result was Trivial Pursuit. They involved a couple of other people, Chris' brother John and Ed Werner, and founded a company, Horn Abbott, to publish and promote the game. Early production and distribution proved a loss making exercise but gradually over the next three years the game became more and more popular. In 1984, 20 million games were sold in the United States.",
