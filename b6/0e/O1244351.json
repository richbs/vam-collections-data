Nomura was a company borne out of the Allied occupation of Japan, immediately after the end of the war. The development of manufacturing businesses was a key concern of the allies and they helped establish the toy manufacturers that produced most of the tin toys globally around this time. Ironically, it was American and British military themed toys that were the biggest selling in the post war period, and so the Japanese manufacturers had to make toys depicting their occupiers. Towards the 1950s, as interest in the military moved on, the Japanese companies adapted the templates of their tin toys, printing them with space-age designs instead.",
