Highly prized for its colour, translucency and brilliant shine, tortoiseshell was used for furniture inlays and luxurious accessories in the 17th century.\n\nDesigns & Designing\nThis set belongs to an intriguing group of tortoiseshell objects, made in Jamaica between 1671 and 1690. The style of decoration suggests all of the objects were made by the same artist.  Many bear the distinctive scrolling tulip and sunflower motifs seen on these combs.\n\nPeople\nWho the creator of these remarkable objects was remains a mystery.  There is no record of such a craftsman on the island during this period, nor any indication of the artist's nationality. Lady Lynch, wife of the new Governor of Jamaica Sir Thomas Lynch, may have commissioned some of these tortoiseshell objects. As an amateur artist, she may also have influenced the design of their decoration. Lady Lynch sent one set of the combs and case to Lady Arlington in 1682, along with '400 lbs of the best white sugar from Barbados ... and some vanillas'.\n\nPlace\nThe decoration on the tortoiseshell relates directly to Britain's seizure of the island. The newly awarded arms of Jamaica are engraved on one side of the case, while the three plants important to Jamaica's economy are represented on the other.",
