Iron rich clay collected from the mineral rich soil of the paddy fields created the warm and subtle gradiations in colour as illustrated on this tea vessel. Manipulation of firing and cooling techniques within the kilns created dynamic surface decoration that was both simple and restrained. The dark brown hues of this bottle, caused by an abundance of ash within the cooling kiln, were a form of kiln mutation known as 'Yohen' and was particularly admired. These visual effects, previously considered the detriment of hasty and cheap manufacture, became to be appreciated on Bizen wares due to their unique rustic appearance and elegant simplicity. \n\nThe wide base and monumental form of the Bizen bottles, as exemplified by this piece, was ideal for the storage of large volumes of liquid; while the delicate neck and rounded lip of the bottle was suitable for pouring. The muted colour, lack of glaze and decoration was ideal for a piece that would probably have been used in the inns  and homes around Japan. Its warm colour and unadorned natural appearance was admired for its wabi or 'quiet taste'.",
