            "public_access_description": "Black paper silhouette by the pioneering shadow-puppeteer, Lotte Reiniger, of L\u00e9onide Massine lifting  Alexandra Danilova kicking her legs and waiving her arms over his head as he runs along. \nSigned LR in pencil on Japanese tissue\nCreated like a greetings card  with the words LA BOUTIQUE FANTASQUE DE BASIL BALLET written in capitals in ink at bottom of card front. When open without backing behind the figures the full effect of a shadow puppet film cell is achieved. A white backing sheet has been added to the inside of the card\n\nThe silhouette conveys the exuberance of the Can-can which was the highlight of the ballet. La Boutique fantasque was one of the most popular ballets choreographed by L\u00e9onide Massine for Serge Diaghilev\u2019s Ballets Russes at the Alhambra Theatre, London on 5 June 1919. It was inspired by the popular Viennese ballet Puppenf\u00e9e in which the toys in a shop come to life. The Can-can dancers replace the Fairy Doll as the stars of the show dancing a show-stopping Can-can before eloping to prevent their separation when purchased by different families. Massine had created the role of the male danseur while Alexandra Danilova became one of the most famous interpreters of the female can-can dancer. The ballet was performed to an arrangement of music by Gioachino Rossini arranged by Ottorino Respighi; the designs were by Andre Derain La Boutique fantasque was first performed by the De Basil\u2019s Ballets Russes at the Royal Opera House Covent Garden on 16 July 1934.\n\nLotte Reiniger (1899-1981) created silhouettes of De Basil\u2019s Ballets Russes for illustrations in periodicals and as souveniers sold through the book dealer Ifan Kyrle Fletcher. They came in a folder marked Boutique Fantasque and stating 2 Danilova 2gns each; 1 Danilova and Massine 2gns, 3 Danilova & Massine 3 gns each.",
