All the theatre staff appear to have been necessarily versatile at Hereford theatre. The Acting Manager Mr Shuter Bland, the Stage Manager Mr. Staunton, and the Artist - presumably the scenic artist Mr. Santer - took roles in both The Lady of Lyonsand The Railway Station!,while the prompter Mr. Churchouse appeared as Gaspar in The Lady of Lyons,presumably deputising his prompting duties for that part of the evening. To whom is a mystery since all the theatre staff named on the playbill were also in the play.\n\nThe behaviour of 19th century theatre audiences was frequently boisterous, and that at Hereford appears to have been no exception since a note on the playbill reassures the public that: 'A Police Officer will be in attendance every night to keep the strictest order'. It is also interesting to note that tickets, places for the Boxes, and season tickets could be purchased from John Parker (billed as Bookseller as well as Printer) as well as at the theatre.  Another note reminds patrons that they can have a daily programme delivered to them, on application to the Acting Manager Mr. Shuter Bland.",
