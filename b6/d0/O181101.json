Game comprises a plastic mat printed in a grid formation with different coloured circles in either green, blue, red or yellow. The playerrs act like giant human playing pices moving around a board. Contents also contains a spinner device with instructions as to where to place each hand and foot on a different colour. The game can be played with two or more players who all stand on the mat and await an instruction as to which hand or which foot must be placed on which coloured circle. The aim of the game is beat the others players in to position and to not fall over even if the instructions (or your lack of speed) require you to twist in to a difficult position in order to reach one of the required spots.\nThe box is sealed but the illustration on the front of a cartoon boy and girl simulating the game play. The background of the box contains the blown up image of the 4 coloured circles that are the  basis for the game. The left hand portion of the box is plain white with the synopsis of how to play, and the manufacturers mark printed.",

The aim of the game it to move your left or right hand or foot to the corresponding coloured circle that is determined by a spinner device. While the other players also attempt this, the aim of the game not to fall over even if your body is twisted in to an awkward position.  It was the first game in which the players became the gaming pieces. Twister has been criticised because of the close personal contact it requires with other players, but in general has become a cult classic for children, students and adults alike and has even attracted annual international Twister competitions.",
