She particularly made her mark when the Ballets Russes returned to London after the War, as a result of which Beaumont produced this limited edition book. In the introductory text Beaumont describes the tall Tchernicheva as 'arresting and majestic'. On page five he describers her in Mikhail Fokine's ballet, Les Sylphides (1909). 'In Les Sylphides she appears in the familiar costume of the classic ballet. Her long skirt of white tulle, her pale face relieved only by her dark hair bound with a garland of forget-me-nots invests her with a cold beauty and a quiet grace so that she seems to be a divinity from another, purer world, and in this difficult pas seul she displays a sound knowledge of the technique of her art.'",

Instead of the sylvian setting the floor is silver with a suggestion of theatrical stage flats behind with a break showing a starry night sky.",
