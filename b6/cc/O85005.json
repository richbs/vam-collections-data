However, if they were decorated they could also be carried purely as fashionable accessories and given as gifts.This example has whitework embroidery, worked in detached buttonhole and satin stitches, needle lace and cutwork decoration. Cutwork is the earliest form of needle lace. It is based on a woven ground, from which areas have been cut away. Elaborate cutwork was an important decoration on fashionable dress for both men and women from about 1570 to 1620.",

Decorated in this way the handkerchief had a function beyond its everyday use, and could be carried as a fashionable accessory.  The technique of cutwork used here was the creation of a delicate structure of needle lace stitches across the spaces cut in a fine linen ground.  It reached the height of its popularity in the late sixteenth and early seventeeth century, when it was used to decorate every type of linen and in particular to draw attention to the face and throat in the form of collars and ruffs.",
