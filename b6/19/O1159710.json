He had his first major success with his designs for the National Theatre's production of The Royal Hunt of the Sun (1964); this established him at the National Theatre and he regularly designed productions there until the early 1970s. In 1972 he was responsible for a notable setting for Long Day's Journey into Night which starred Laurence Olivier and was directed by Michael Blakemore. This began a working relationship with Blakemore which lasted for 12 years and 10 productions, including three of Michael Frayn's West End successes, Make Or Break (1981), the award winning Noises Off (1983) and Benefactors (1984). Annals also worked in opera and ballet, designing for the major companies in Britain and America, and was Associate Professor of Scenic Design at Yale in 1966-1967. In 1984 he gave up the stage and took up photography and illustration.",
