There is strapwork and leafy decoration in the spaces between these main motifs.\n[design with patch removed] The patch covers the top right part of the drawing. It depicts the central, possibly female, wreathed figure on a pedastal, holding aloft a garland in its raised right hand and arm. When the patch is removed, the design shows a male, bearded, hatted figure emerging from the mouth of a fish. The male figure is thus similar to a figure of Triton. He appears to have four arms showing the alternatives of lowered and raised positions.\n\nWith the patch removed, the seated female, playing an oboe, on the right side is in pencil. She is in pen and ink on teh patch.  \n[patch] Patch of paper, with drawing in pen and ink, situated over the upper right side of the design. The patch depicts a possibly female, wreathed figure, standing on a pedestal and holding aloft a garland in its right hand and raised arm beneath which to the right of the design is a seated female figure playing an oboe, in pen and ink.",

Dr Sebastian Edwards wrote in 2012 that 'it is uncertain for which location these hangings were made, because there is no inventory for Mary or William's period, and they have had their borders and edges removed, which makes it hard to be sure they were made for Queen Mary's Closet.  It has been suggested that they were the final solution to several proposals made for this room in Mary's lifetime, in various media. Edwards stated that 'my own feeling is that he (Daniel Marot) acted very much as an architectural design-advisor to the Queen especially in the early years of rebuilding the palace, from 1689, but was not very much involved if at all by the time William came to complete the palace ten years later.\n[design with patch removed] The design with the patch removed showing a male figure emerging from a fish, like a figure of Triton,was not used for the embroidered panels in the Queen's closet at Hampton Court Palace.\n[patch] The design of the possibly female, wreathed figure standing on a pedestal was used for the embroidered panels in the Queen's closet at Hampton Court Palace.",
