The angular niche is outlined by a band of dark blue bearing small rosettes separated by a green Z motif.\n\nBorders: there are five borders: from the inside:\n\na) very narrow, dark blue ground with tiny flowerheads, red or white in the lowr border but varied elsewhere.\n\nb) reciprocal trefoil design in red and blue.\n\nc) and e) dark blue ground, as niche band but with simplified flowers and multi-coloured Z motifs.\n\nd) main border with red ground containing multi-coloured, angular, barred S motifs with triangles at their forked terminals.\n\nGuard stripes: dark brown ground with small, white, diagonal blocks.\n\n* with some very few apparently asymmetrical knots; open to the right, in eg. the inner border",
