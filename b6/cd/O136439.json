            "public_access_description": "Having worked as a theatrical scenery painter david Cox began painting watercolours in 1804. He exhibited at the RA from 1805 and from 1809 until 1812 with the Associated Artists in Water Colour (1805-1812). Cox received instruction from the watercolour artist John Varley (1778-1842) following his arrival in London. His early works consist of rural scenes combining solid line and deep colours. In the 1820s and 1830s Cox travelled to France, Belgium and Holland, where he made vibrant pencil and wash sketches. \n\nThis watercolour showing a canal running through a town reflects the type of scene that was popular amongst watercolour artists in the early nineteenth century. The composition is created from a combination of rich browns and reds of the bricks of the buildings and bridge of the scene. Our eye is drawn to the barge by the bright blue waistcoat worn by the figure navigating it. Before the introduction of the steam railway in 1830 canals were the main form of transport for goods that were being produced as part of the industrial revolution. While this watercolour shows a tranquil canal the inclusion of a barge refers to industry that was boosting the British economy in the early nineteenth century.",
