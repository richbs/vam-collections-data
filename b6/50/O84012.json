Sir Arthur Phayre, Commissioner of British Burma, accompanied the mission and acted as interpreter. \n\nThese three watercolours which were presented to the Victoria and Albert Museum by the great niece of Sir Arthur Phayre allow us to witness the pomp with which Burmese ministers travelled,  through the eyes of a Burmese court artist who accompanied the mission. \n\nAt his second meeting in Calcutta, the ambassador, shown with his entourage carrying his swords, gold umbrellas and receptacles of rank, is seen strolling hand in hand with Phayre. He is portrayed in his elaborate and distinctive military court dress worn with a shweipei hkamauk (helmet) and a mauk-yu (skullcap), on this occasion wearing shoes with his pahsoe (type of sarong) drawn up to resemble breeches. This was one of two sets of robes (one civil and one military) which would have been presented to him, following his appointment, to indicate his rank.",

Mildred Archer in \"Company Paintings\" (see Ref. below) was also of the opinion that they were executed by a Burmese artist. \n\nPreviously considered illustrations recording Sir Arthur Phayre's mission to Mandalay in 1855. When Mildred Archer had the Burmese inscriptions above the paintings translated by U Tin Pe of the Burmese Embassy in London they were re-attributed to the earlier mission in December 1854 led by the Chief Queen's Ambassador Ashin Nanmadaw Payawun Mingyi from the Court of Mindon to Calcutta.",
