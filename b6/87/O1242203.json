The image was created for publication in an illustrated magazine or newspaper and painted by Sir Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Forestier (1854 \u2013 1930). It is signed with his initials in the bottom left hand corner. \n\nHerbert Beerbohm Tree (1853-1917) was London's leading actor-manager in the Edwardian era. His wife, born Helen Maud Holt (1863\u20131937),  was already acting when she met her husband and from the time her marriage to the actor Herbert Beerbohm Tree in the early 1880s she was professionally known as Mrs Beerbohm Tree and subsequently, Lady Tree. \nThe two established an extremely successful theatrical partnership. Tree took over the Haymarket Theatre from the Bancrofts in 1885 before moving to his newly built Her Majesty's Theatre in 1897. The programme at the Haymarket featured plays by Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde and Henry Arthur Jones and the spectacular productions there became famous for their detailed and realistic settings. \n\nThe Charlatan, by Robert Buchanan was performed at the Haymarket Theatre between the 18th of January and 17th of  March, 1894. The action took place at the castle of the Earl of Wanborough and the story centred upon the power of theosophy and hypnotle over the human mind. The scene depicted in this illustration shows the moment when Philip Woodville, having determined that if Isabella Arlington will not be his wife she shall at least be nobody else\u2019s, has used 'hypnotic arts' to attract her to his room at midnight. His repentance, and subseqent redemption, provides the climax of the drama.\n\nSir Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Forestier (1854 \u2013 1930) was an Anglo-French artist and illustrator. He began working for the Illustrated London News in 1882 and became known for his attention to detail and historical illustrations.\n\nThis item is one of several theatrical drawings from a collection of sketches commissioned from contemporary artists to be printed in illustrated magazines. The collection was donated to the museum by Sir William James Ingram in 1914.",
