The shape is based on a prototype of the Warring States Period, and consists of a cylinder set on three animal feet, representing elephant, tiger and deer.  There is a rectangular handle through which curls a dragon, carved with a sharp spine and curling tail.  The body is craved with a pair of striding dragons raised in low relief, their bodies turning into squared archaistic scrolling, set on a ground of spirals raised in relief, between narrow bands of T-fret.  The underside of the base is incised with randomly arranged scrolling, possibly depicting claws emerging from clouds. Its condition is damaged, chipped, though has some filled-in repairs, particularly around the top of the handle.  One foot of the hare in broken off.",
