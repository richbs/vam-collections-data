Born into a Jewish family in Frankfurt, she initially pursued an academic career. She taught herself photography to illustrate her own writing on the German Neo-classical architect Friedrich Gilly. In 1929 she bought herself a Leica camera and turned her attention to the new architecture being built around her home town of Frankfurt. The Dutch Modernist architect Mart Stam commissioned her to record several of his ambitious and radical building projects. Dizzy angles, flat plains and strong shadows were all part of a contemporary language of art and design pioneered by both the \u2018New Photography\u2019 and the new architecture. In 1930 Bing moved to Paris to concentrate on photography.",
