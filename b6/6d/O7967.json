The earlier of the two dates from towards the end of James I's reign.  The back panel is divided by mouldings into geometrically-shaped compartments, which are filled with foliate sprays carved with unusual delicacy.  Recumbent female figures flank a finial on the cresting, and the legs and arm-supports are of fluted baluster from with Ionic capitals - an unusual feature on chairs.  The other dates from nearer the middle of the century, and the back panel is decorated with an inlaid pattern of flowers.\"\n\nFile note (by R. Edwards?) \nexplains that Clark \"does not greatly care for 'palace' furniture, preferring country-house furniture of the highest quality\u2026\".\n\nHistorical significance: Large numbers of elaborately decorated armchairs of this type were produced in the late 16th and 17th centuries.
