It could not publish officially and had to rely on the underground production of printed materials. In addition, Solidarity was supported by a number of offices in foreign countries which took charge of designing, printing and distributing Solidarity materials outside of Poland. This bilingual poster commemorates six years of the existence of the Polish independent trade union Solidarity. It emphasizes the fact that, although it is underground, Solidarity still exists. The slogan \u2018six years\u2019 is depicted using the typeface and symbol of the Polish flag based on the famous Solidarity logo designed by Jerzy Janiszewski in 1980. This kind of design reveals the power of the logo and its grounded position in people\u2019s minds.\n\nSolidarity, founded in September 1980, was the first free trade union in an Eastern Bloc country. It became the leading political force opposing the communist regime in Poland. Eventually the Polish Government was forced to negotiate with the Solidarity-led opposition, resulting in semi-free elections on 4th June 1989. This marked a crucial stage in the democratic transformation of Central and Eastern Europe.",
