            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nThis German porcelain figure was made to accompany a shepherdess. Idealised representations of shepherds and shepherdesses, often fashionably dressed, were very popular in mid-18th century Europe. In Britain such figures might have been displayed on a domestic furnishing, or, as in Germany, they might have been set out on a dining table during the dessert course of a grand meal. Meissen was the first factory to make porcelain figures for this purpose. They gradually replaced the sugar paste and wax figures that had been made from medieval times for royal wedding feasts. These were originally made to celebrate political allegiances. By the 16th century, allegorical themes had been introduced, and by the 18th century many were entirely decorative.\n\nTrading\nContinental porcelain could not be legally imported for sale in Britain until 1775, unless it was stated to be for personal use, not for resale. Despite this, in the 1750s large quantities of Meissen porcelain were sold in London china shops. Much of this was imported under the pretence that it was for personal use, but some was smuggled in. Meissen porcelain was greatly admired in mid-18th century Britain, and the English porcelain factories made many close copies of Meissen figures and wares.",
