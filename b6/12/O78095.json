Approximately 5 million of the 6 million visitors came from outside London, both from Britain and from abroad.  Thousands of people travelled long distances to visit the Exhibition, many on the newly built railways. This map of London shows the location of the Crystal Palace as well as other sights exhibition visitors might want to see. A number of attractions were specially created, such as Wyld's own 'Monster Globe' in Leicester Square, and museums such as the British Museum  had specially extended visiting hours. Some visitors had never been to London before and some stayed  for several days to see the capital's sights and entertainments.",
