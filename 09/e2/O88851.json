The neckline is round at the front and has V-cut opening at the back. The dress is completely covered with vertical rows of glass beads, in shades of green, blue and white. A horizontal row of beads at the hips emphasises the low waisted style of the first half of the 1920s.\n\nShort and square gowns were often embroidered with sequins, pearls or metallic threads to achieve the maximum effect of brilliance and to accentuate the movement of the newly developed jazz dances, such as the Charleston. This particular dancing dress displays the typical geometrical motifs of the Art Deco period.",
