It is signed by the three managers of the theatre, all of whom were also actors - Robert Wilks (1665-1732), Colley Cibber (1671-1757) and Barton Booth (1681-1733).  The actor Thomas Doggett (1670-1721), a former partner, had retired in disgust when his enemy Booth was allowed a share in the theatre.\n\nThe bill relates to the plays The Country Wake, The Rover and King Lear, presented respectively on Wednesday 30th May, Thursday 31st May and Friday 1st June. The stage blood cost tuppence for each performance of The Country Wake and King Lear, while a ballad sheet was bought for threepence on Wednesday, and 'a truss of straw' for a shilling on Friday. The lightning for King Lear is noted as costing sixpence - presumably some powder for a pyrotechnic effect in the storm scene. Two of the most intriguing expenses were for The Rover - two and sixpence for the loan of  'a great picture' and a shilling for 'a quarter pound of counters.' This appears to be a copy of a bill prepared for accounting purposes since it is one of a similar group of items.",
