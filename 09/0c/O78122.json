It shows an unknown fashionable young lady and is probably a portrait of a friend or relative of the artist.  Rigby's initials 'ER' can be seen lower-right, with the date of the sitting: 'April 17 1831'.\n\nPeople\nElizabeth Rigby was the daughter of a Norwich doctor.  She was taught drawing and watercolour by the local Norwich artist John Sell Cotman (1782-1842), who, like many artists, supplemented his meagre income from commissions by teaching.  Though Rigby became a notable writer, particularly on travel and art, she never referred to her former teacher.  And despite her success as a writer, she once told a friend that she preferred to paint. In 1849 she became Lady Eastlake on her marriage to the Royal Academician and Director of the National Gallery, London, Sir Charles Eastlake.\n\nOwnership & Use\nIn 1831, when this portrait was drawn, Rigby was living with her mother at Framingham, south-east of Norwich, having returned from a two-year trip to Germany in 1829.  Portraiture, of course, was a favourite genre for many amateur artists. But, just as many well-to-do artistic women and men did before photography became a popular hobby, Rigby also recorded her travels in Britain and abroad.",
