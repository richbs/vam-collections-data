The motif of a duck with foliage in its beak is reminiscent of a style seen in paintings from the Dunhuang caves--a Buddhist site in western China. This style has also been a source of inspiration for Chinese artists since the 1940s, as an alternative to drawing upon the art of the 18th century or characterising the more recent imperial past. \n\nThis dish formed part of a tableware commission for the Peking Hotel, which reopened in 1952, and was one of the key attempts to create a 'national' design idiom for the People's Republic of China.",
