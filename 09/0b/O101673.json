In it we see Judy attacking Punch, traditionally because she is angry with him for his treatment of their baby.  To the right of the Punchman's booth there is the musician who also acted as a 'bottler' after the show, taking a bottle round for the collection.\n\nPunch and Judy is one of the most traditional forms of British entertainment which was first seen in Great Britain in the 17th century.  When Charles II returned to England after the Puritain interregnum, entertainers from the continent came too, including puppeteers. They brought a string puppet character based on the Italian Commedia dell'Arte figure, Pulchinello.  In England he was called Punchinello, and eventually Punch.  He was noted for the first time in England by Samuel Pepys. In May 1662 he saw 'an Italian puppet play' in Covent Garden. He brought his wife to see it two weeks later.  That October the same show was performed for the king at Whitehall.",
