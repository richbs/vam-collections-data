In the south of Italy the main material used to add a red colour to jewellery was coral, but in the north jewellers often used garnets.\n\nIn the south of Italy, particularly in those places which had been under Spanish rule, many women wore decorative combs in their hair.  These combs were not restricted to traditional costume, and would have been worn just as readily with fashionable dress.  This comb was acquired in Parma, in the north of Italy, where combs were not part of traditional costume.  \n\nIt was bought for \u00a31 16s as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
