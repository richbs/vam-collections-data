Each kind of brooch has its own distinctive name, some of which date back to the Middle Ages.  \n\nIn the 1860s, Norwegian silversmiths working in the main towns started to make fashionable jewellery in traditional Norwegian styles, and this is one of those brooches.  It is shaped like a traditional slanges\u00f8lje ring brooch, but the central tang is non-functional, and there is a modern brooch fitting on the back.  It was made by Tor Grinderud, an accomplished silversmith from Lunde in Telemark, who specialised in the new kind of filigree.\n\nIt was bought for \u00a31 10s. at the International Exhibition, London, 1872.",
