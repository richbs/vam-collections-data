            "public_access_description": "In much of his work Chagall (1887-1985) reveals his fascination with myths and folklore. This suite of prints was commissioned by one of the most far-sighted and original publishers of the 20th century, Ambroise Vollard. He recognised that Chagall's imagination would perfectly match the fables of the 17th-century French writer Jean de La Fontaine, which were in fact a retelling of Aesop. In this tale, the wolf persuades the stork to remove with his long bill a bone stuck in the wolf's throat. The stork then asks for his promised reward. The wolf simply laughs, telling the stork he should be grateful he was not eaten when he stuck his head down a wolf's throat. Aesop's moral was that in serving the wicked, expect no reward; and be thankful if you escape injury for your pains.",
