The table is minutely described in the inventory of the Garde-Meuble de la Couronne - the French Royal Wardrobe.\n\nThe top is of a form associated with the desks produced in the Oeben-Riesener workshops in the 1750s and 1760s and would have been old-fashioned in 1776. Moreoever, the attributes depicted in the marquetry are not those one would normally associate with a queen and it has been suggested that the table was originally designed for Louis XV but was left unfinished at the time of his death in 1774.  Whatever the case, the Queen seems to have had two tables of this old-fashioned type at the Petit Trianon. It was perhaps the astonishing quality of the marquetry which made them acceptable even for those stylish interiors in the new, neo-classical taste. During the reign of William IV, some English cabinet-maker incorporated this panel into a desk of unpleasing proportions from which it has now been detached for display.\n\nMuseum No. 138-1865"

            "public_access_description": "Although the military subject matter of the marquetry on this panel might suggest that this panel was made for a man, it was made for the household of Marie-Antonette, Queen of France.  The panel originally formed the top of a luxurious writing table, supplied in 1776 for her study in the Petit Trianon, her personal retreat within the grounds of the Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles.  \n\nDespite the fine workmanship of this table, it was relatively old-fashioned when it was delivered to the Queen. The form of table was one invented by the court cabinet Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Oeben in the 1750s. Riesener, the maker of this table, had been apprenticed to Oeben, taking on his workshop after his death in 1763 and marrying his widow. The decorative top panel of such desks slid back to reveal luxurious fittings, usually providing both for the personal toilette and for reading and writing.  Why such martial motifs were chosen by or for the queen is a mystery, but it is possible that the panel was originally intended for another royal patron and it was the sheer virtuosity of the marquetry which caused it to be given a new life for the queen.",

In 1756 Oeben, who was already a court cabinet-maker, had been given workshops in the Arsenal. There he developed a particular interest in mechanical furniture, producing for example, the large springs which allowed these decorative table tops to move smoothly backwards and forwards.  When Oeben died in 1763, Jean-Henri Riesener, who had trained with him, maintained the workshop, eventually marrying Oeben's widow in 1767.  He continued to produce versions of some Oeben designs, as well as developing himself some of the most luxurious designs for furniture in the new neo-classical style.",
