            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nThis grand dish, described as a 'bread plate' but hardly meant for use, was made especially for the Great Exhibition of 1851 to demonstrate Pratt's superb polychrome printing technique. The printed scene shows Christ reproving the Pharisees for their criticism of the disciples' plucking and eating ears of corn on the Sabbath: '...I will have mercy and not sacrifice...' (Matthew XII.I.vii).  A fully realistic image such as this gave Pratt the widest scope to show just how subtle and varied a range of colours and images he could reproduce.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe firm of F. & R. Pratt was founded at Fenton, Stoke-on-Trent, in about 1774 by  Felix and Richard Pratt, who specialised in enamel-painted figures in moulded earthenware.  In 1828 Felix Edwards Pratt (1813-1894) joined the family firm, followed by his brother William.  With his engraver and artist Jesse Austin (1806-1879) , F.E. Pratt devised a process of high-quality underglaze colour printing on pottery. Each oil colour was transferred from the copperplate to the ware by means of 'Pottery tissue', the final imprint being the outline of the picture. Four or five copperplates were employed. Glazing and firing the piece completed the process, which was known as the 'Austin process'.\n\nTrading\nF.E. Pratt took out a patent to improve the manufacture of pot lids in 1847.  Makers of pomades or bear's grease (for dressing the hair), toilet creams, and meat and fish pastes soon adopted their pictorial containers.  Pratt's also made tea and dessert services, jugs, vases and plaques. The company introduced unusual colours such as purple and a mottled malachite green, and they reproduced paintings by Thomas Gainsborough (1727-1788), William Mulready (1786-1863), Sir David Wilkie (1785-1841) and others, which they showed at  international exhibition in Britain.  They also exhibited American views at New York in 1853, the Philadelphia Centennial exhibition in 1876 and the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893.",
