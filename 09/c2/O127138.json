            "public_access_description": "The hugely talented and prolific modeller J.J. K\u00e4ndler (1706-1775) worked for the Meissen porcelain factory between 1731 and 1775, a period of forty-four years in which he created over 2000 original models for figures, animals, groups and functional pieces such as this sweetmeat stand. In so doing he single-handedly established most of the sculptural conventions that governed the production of the earliest European porcelain figures. \n\nThe original sculpted model for this piece was listed in K\u00e4ndler\u2019s workbook in May 1735, where he described it as an \u2018Indian grotto\u2019 with shells and leaves for holding sweetmeats. He supplied two separately modelled and detachable seated figures \u2013 described as \u2018Japanese\u2019 \u2013 so that the factory could make these sweetmeat stands in matching pairs with male and female figures. Meissen factory documents often use the terms \u2018Indian\u2019 and \u2018Chinese\u2019 interchangeably for anything Chinese, and although K\u00e4ndler described his figures as Japanese, the man\u2019s scallop-bordered tunic and trousers are very similar to those of Meissen porcelain figures that were clearly intended as Chinese. \n\nThe term \u2018sweetmeat\u2019 was used for several different types of sweet delicacies, including cakes and pastries, sweets, and nuts and fruit preserved in sugar. They were served in the final, dessert course of a grand meal.",
