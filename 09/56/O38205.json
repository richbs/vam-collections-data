The dress has a\n rounded neck, and wrist-length sleeves, all finished with an edging of\n white machine-made lace; the sleeves are gauged at the wrist and hand\n worked with honeycomb smocking in white silks.  The yoke is largely\n made up of strips of coarser white muslin insertion, which are\n machine-embroidered in white with stylized flowers, and mitred\n together to form a squared shape.  The gathered skirt falls from the\n yoke, and the centre front also has a panel of honeycomb smocking hand\n worked in white silks, between two pairs of vertical tucks; the hem is\n machine-embroidered with stylized flowers in white and has a pie-crust\n edge.  The garment fastens at the yoke back with buttons and stitched\n loops.",
