They are all in a mixed state of dress with clothes that have been patched.  Three of the children and the man are looking over the side of the bridge watching either boats passing or traffic on the next bridge.  Two of the children have climbed onto the bridge wall another child is turned and is facing the viewer.  A bundle of wood wrapped in a blanket lays discarded at one side of the picture.  In the background is a outline of the city landscape.  The art work is named and dated in the left corner and the title is written on the right.

These watercolours date from Golden's time  at the RCA, where she trained in illustration.\n\nGolden spent most of her career capturing life on  and around the Thames. Her meticulous eye for  detail and human interest creates work rich in  documentary flourishes. In 'Fourstones  Tournament', the cropped legs of adults and the  closeness of the paving slabs propel us into the  children's intense world.  Meanwhile, on 'The  Bridge', boys clamber upon this climbing frame  and viewing platform suspended high above the  city.\n\nGolden's work is represented in many national  collections including the Museum of London,  Imperial War Museum and the Tate.\n\nThe children in Golden's paintings are working  class Londoners, and her snapshot-like paintings  offer a colourful record of the appearance and  activities of this group of children between the  Wars.",
