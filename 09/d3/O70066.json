Another bowl of mussels on the right, and shells on the floor, at left a black cat licking a bowl. Adriaen Brouwer, (1605/6-1638) was a Flemish painter also active in the northern Netherlands. His paintings are characterised by their thin, partly transparent layers of paint on a light-coloured ground. CAI.80 appears to be one of the artist's early works executed in bright natural colours and is a good example of one of his favourite themes, the representation of the everyday world of peasants and simple folk, not at work, but mainly relaxing at the inn. Brouwer exploited the Dutch tradition of filling the space with figures drinking, card-playing, throwing dice and quarreling and in doing so referred back to a medieval tradition in which these activities were judged in accordance with the Christian canon of vices as the deadly sins of gluttony and anger. His works may be read as an expression of  a moralising message -as a warning against excessive drinking, which leads to nausea, quarrels and sloth. This work has a distinguished history. It may have belonged to Brouwer\u2019s fellow artist Rubens, as well as to the 10th Duke of Hamilton, an important 19th-century collector.",

In 1631 he moved to Antwerp, where he was imprisoned two years later, perhaps on the suspicion of being a spy, more likely for debt. He was released in the same year and died at Antwerp in January 1638. He painted scenes of peasant life and, in particular, the interiors of taverns, of which he was said to have been an <i>habitu\u00e9</i>.      \n\n50 \nINTERIOR OF A ROOM WITH FIGURES: \nA MAN PLAYING THE LUTE AND A WOMAN \nSigned on wall on right <i>AB</i> (monogram) \n<i>Oak panel</i> \n14\u00bd X 11\u00bd (37 X 29.2) \nIonides Bequest \nCAI.80\n\nThe broad and fluid manner and the elimination of superfluous detail indicate a late work; Bode (1924) and Knuttel (1962) agree in dating it c. 1635-38. Hofstede de Groot (1910) remarked on the Teniers-like character of CAI.80, but, as Bode pointed out, it was such late works by Brouwer that influenced Teniers rather than the other way round. \n\n<i>Prov.:</i> Jacques Meyer sale, Rotterdam, 9 Sept. 1722, lot 169, 202 florins (G.

Little is known about his early career and training but by 1631\u20132 he was enrolled in the Antwerp Guild of St Luke as an independent master. His paintings are characterised by thin, partly transparent layers of paint on a light-coloured ground. The figures, subtly differentiated by shading in the colour, are completely integrated with the interiors in order to convey a sense of atmosphere. Drapery is modelled with a pointed brush in short parallel strokes.\n\nAlthough previously dated to the late 1630s, comparison with the artist's early works such as <i>The Pancake Baker</i> (The Philiadelphia Museum of Art, cat. 681) reveal that CAI.80 is executed in the same bright natural colouration, which become darker and more sparing in his later works, and an almost identical compositional structure. CAI. 80 is typical of Brouwer's favourite themes, the representation of the everyday world of peasants and simple folk relaxing at the inn.  Brouwer however, exploited the Dutch tradition of filling the space with figures drinking, card-playing, throwing dice and quarreling. His works may be read as an expression of  a moralisingmessage -as a warning against excessive drinking, which leads to nausea, quarrels and sloth.",

            "historical_context_note": "Genre paintings involving low class society, especially peasants, became increasingly popular in the first half of the 17th century in the Netherlands. They were associated with health, liberty and pleasure that could be found in the countryside in response to the new security of the Dutch countryside following the initiation of the Twelve-Years' Truce in 1609. The coarse appearance of Molanear's figures recalls those of the leading figures of the Haarlem school in that field: Adriaen Brouwer (1606-1638) and Adriaen van Ostade (1610-1685).",
