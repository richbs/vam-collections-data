On various papers mounted in a volume full bound in leather, gold tooled. \n\n<i>Some signed variously</i> J. Deare, Deare, <i>and</i> JP <i> and </i> P, <i>with dates ranging from 1748 to 1790 and inscribed with notes etc. \nPen and ink, wash, pencil and red chalk. \nSize of volume</i>     (29.8 x 41 cm.)     E.238-376-1968 \n\nBequeathed by Rupert Forbes Gunnis, J.P. \n\n<i>Note:</i> John Deare was sent to Rome by the Royal Academy in 1785 for three years as a travelling student and remained there until his death.  The majority of these drawings, although they are on the whole more freely in drawn, were, like those in the two volumes E.57, 57A-291-1966 already in the Department of Prints and Drawings, made during this period.  \n\nJames Paine made his second journey to Rome in 1774 where he remained for at least nine years; he is not definitely known to have returned to England until 1788.  The drawings initialled by him in this volume were probably made during this period as they are similar in style and subject matter to those in volume 3859 executed in Rome and dated 1774, which is already in the Department of Prints and Drawings. \n\nThe present volume was formerly in the collection of Mr. Derek Sherborn.\"",
