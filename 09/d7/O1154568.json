            "public_access_description": "The first Olympic mascot 'Waldi' a Daschund dog appeared at the 1972 Munich Olympic Games. Mascots are used to communicate the Olympic spirit to the general public, especially youth and children. They are usually a character or animal native to the country where the games are being held and showcase the history and culture unique to the host city. In more recent years it has been common to have more than one mascot. This could be to ensure gender equity but has undoubtedly increased the merchandising potential of the Olympic mascot.\n\nBeibei the fish is one of five 'Fuwa' mascots produced for the Beijing Olympic Games in 2008. Fuwa carries a message of friendship, peace and good wishes from China and embodies the natural characteristics of four of China's most popular animals, the fish 'Beibei', the panda 'Jingjing', the Tibetan antelope 'Yingying' and the Swallow 'Nini'. The fifth mascot 'Huanhuan' represents the Olympic flame. Each of the Fuwa has a rhyming two-syllable name and when their names are put together \"Bei Jing Huan Ying Ni\" they say \"Welcome to Beijing\".\n\n\nAccording to the Beijing Olympic Games official website Beibei the fish symbolises prosperity and harvest. The fish is also a symbol of surplus in Chinese culture, a measure of a good year and a good life. The ornamental lines of the water-wave designs are taken from famous Chinese paintings. Beibei is gentle and pure. Strong in water sports, she represents the blue Olympic ring.",
