He was an acquaintance who lived in Slough (near Windsor) and supplied the King with books and puppies. A number of portraits of King George III in his later life show him with a cane, which he chose to use when out walking, for example the portrait by Peter Edward Stroehling (1768\u2013c.1826) which depict him in 1807 on a terrace at Windsor Castle in his Windsor Uniform (devised for his private household), leaning on a cane, his faithful spaniel looking up at him expectantly. \n\nThis cane is a reminder of how European trading and imperial expansion provided supplies of new materials, which were made up into fashionable commodities in European workshops. Each component of the cane probably came from a different part of the world, from territories colonized by different European powers. The rattan, which is lightweight but strong, took its name from the Malacca Straits, which the Portuguese charted in the sixteenth century; it grows indigenously in Sumatra. The fact that this cane is made of a single piece of rattan reveals it to be a superior product, as it did not need to have joins in order to make it long enough. The ivory probably came from India. The origins of the gold are more difficult to determine, as gold was continually recycled from old gold items given to jewellers, including gold coins from different countries.",

            "historical_context_note": "Malacca is a species of rattan (Calamus Ascipionum) found on the coast of Sumatra. Rattan palms have long, slender stems, suitable for making into canes. The stem is not round, but has a ridge or spine, running along its length, and is light-weight but strong. The bark has a  natural gloss, and its colour varies from brown to blond or reddish amber.\n\nRenowned for his preference for the simple pleasures of family life over court panoply, George III is depicted in later life on a terrace at Windsor Castle in his Windsor Uniform (devised for his private household), leaning on a cane of this length and type, his faithful spaniel looking up at him expectantly (Peter Edward, George III, 1807. Royal Collection).\n\nPrinces were already using canes in Britain in the early seventeenth century. Both Charles I (1600\u201349) and William III (1650\u20131702) were portrayed carrying cane and sword simultaneously. Canes became, however, a truly fashionable accessory in the eighteenth century, replacing the sword for all but the most formal court wear by the mid-1770s. Associated with the English preference for simplicity, the adoption of the cane merited surprised comment from the Swiss traveller C\u00e9sar De Saussure when he was in London in 1726: \u2018[men] wear small round wigs, plain hats, and carry canes in their hands . . . You will see rich merchants and gentlemen thus dressed and sometimes even noblemen of high rank.\u2019",
