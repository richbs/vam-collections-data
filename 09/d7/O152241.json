Curving blue stems form an inner circle of eight white ground heart-shaped segments each containing two red and 1 mauve flower and an outer circle of larger but similar segments with a light yellow ground. Sections of these outer  patterns are repeated in each corner of the central panel.  The central decoration is printed on top of a blue stemmed meander repeated one and half times on a white ground.  It bears exotic blossoms and  carnations and pomegranates and spotted pod-like leaves.\nThe central field is framed by two narrow bands extended to form a square box in each of the outermost corners. The bands are: \n[a] a reciprocal trefoil in blue and white\n[b] a meander of blue leaves with an infill of a simple 4-petalled rosette in red and mauve on a light yellow ground.\nThe corner boxes contain a vase with a floral spray pointing inwards.  There is a wide band from these four boxes, running along the sides and the top and bottom, patterned with a blue leafy meander bearing similar but larger exotic blossoms as in the main field. This is edged with a repeat of the [a] and [b] borders.\nThe backing is roller printed on a cream ground with a repeating pattern of small flower heads in 2 shades of red arranged in off-set rows.  The pieces of fabric have been sewn together.\nThe facing is bias-cut dark blue plain weave cotton.\nColours: two shades of red, blue, yellow, mauve, black.",
