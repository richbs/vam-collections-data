NAL Bibliographic Ref..No.: 58.DD.517:\n\u2018The contrast between the designs of the Kyoto-based Moriguchi Kako (1909 -; appointed Living National Treasure in 1967) and his son Moriguchi Kunihiko, who was responsible for this kimono, says much about the diversity of interests informing the work of contemporary Japanese <i>yuzen</i> artists. Kako\u2019s classicising designs, often executed in an expansive painterly style, are based directly on the sketches of nature that he regularly goes out to draw. The titles of Kunihiko\u2019s highly innovative and equally arresting kimono reflect a similarly deep-rooted concern with the natural world. His designs are arrived at not through direct observation of nature, however, but through a process of abstraction that involves taking a single stylised motif and subjecting it to a series of mathematically determined transformations.\n\u2018\u2026An additional technique unique to the Moriguchis, and used to magnificaent effect on this kimono, is the sprinkling on of small particles of rice resist past prior to and between applications of the background colours. The mottling that this so-called <i>makinori</i> (sprinkled rice paste) technique gives rise to can be gradated by varying the density of application of the resist particles. The pioneering of the <i>makinori</i> technique by Moriguchi Kako dates back to the period immediately after he became a fully qualified <i>yuzen</i> master in 1939.\u2019\n\nFor a description of the basic techniques of <i>yuzen</i>-dyeing, see FE.420:1-1992.",
