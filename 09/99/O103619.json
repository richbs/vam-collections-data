To ensure a steady flame, the long, dangling wick needed to be trimmed to prevent it falling into the melted grease. Snuffers trim the wick of a candle; this example has steel blades inserted into the silver to enable them to trim the wick more effectively. The burned bits of greasy wick are caught in the box. The snuffers are marked by the London goldsmith John Quantock, who had been apprenticed to the specialist candlestick maker James Gould. Like Gould, Quantock made plate associated with lighting his speciality.",

These are the same arms as the snuffer tray that accompanies them and which is also engraved with the words 'Kings Closet'. This suggests the snuffers and tray formed a set made by John Quantock for the household of George II, and which later passed to the Broke family. The snuffers and tray were among the 978 objects lent to the Museum by the antiquary and collector George Babington Croft Lyons, and bequeathed by him to the V&amp;A on his death in 1926.",
