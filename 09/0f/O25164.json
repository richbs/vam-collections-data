He held political control over the region in which the Sun temple was constructed and was the actual patron of the temple, yet he is shown as smaller than his guru.  The guru sits cross-legged, with one arm raised in a gesture of explanation.  The bearded king, seated in the centre of the sculpture, is stripped of all royal symbols.  His sword lies on the ground in front of him.  Instead of a weapon he holds a palm-leaf manuscript, the original medium for transcribing sacred texts in India.  Besides the king are two attendants: one sits reading a palm-leaf manuscript; the other stands with his hands joined together in a demonstration of reverance.  On the lower register, in smaller scale, four warriors stand with shields and weapons.  The message is clear here at the temple even the king must defer to the status of priestly intermediaries if he is to partake of the benefits of divine power and favour.",

Here he is receiving spiritual council from his Vaisnava priest, probably the Brahmana Acaryaraja. \n\nThe composition is hieratic, with the king represented smaller than his priest to reflect the relationship of pupil to teacher (\u2018achariya\u2019 or guru). The priest is of high status. He wears fine rings and sits cross-legged as he expounds. \n\nThe bearded king is simply dressed, stripped of all royal symbols. He is seated in a yogic posture, with his sword placed on the ground, holding a palm-leaf manuscript which is emblematic of divine knowledge. He is accompanied by two male figures (perhaps his sons?). \u2018Outside\u2019 four members of the royal guard wait, casually leaning on their shields, decorated with Vishnu\u2019s conch.\n\nThis scene of royal instruction is set against the backdrop of a temple. It is very probably the shrine of Purusottama-Jagannatha (Vishnu as the supreme god), the tutelary deity of the king\u2019s household, at Puri. The Eastern Ganga dynasty closely identified their rulers with Visnu. They adopted  the title' Narasimha' after Vishnu\u2019s 'man-lion' form and claimed descent from Vishnu himself, acting as his agent on earth. Under this system, even the king must defer to priestly intermediaries if he is to enjoy the benefits of divine power and favour.\n\nThis relief is one of a series depicting aspects of royal Vaisnava worship in Orissa and is associated with the Sun Temple at Konarak. Narasimha I was the patron of this mighty temple dedicated to Surya, and this series originally decorated the temple\u2019s walls. A contemporary source suggests that the artist was the eminent sculptor Visvanatha Mahapatra.",

The original text submitted in English reads:\n\n2.30 Sculpture of King NarasiMha (1238-64) and his spiritual advisor\nAttributed to Visvanatha Mahapatra\nCarboniferous shale, 78.5 cm h.\nIndia, Orissa, KoNarak, mid-13th century CE\nVictoria and Albert Museum 938(IS)\n\nThe gigantic, partly-ruined Surya Deul or Sun Temple at KoNarak was built by King NarasiMha of Orissa in about 1241-58. The Orissan kings were seen as deputies of the supreme deity PuruSottama (Jagannatha); NarasiMha was lauded for his military victories and the temple glorified its patron as well as the sun god. This sculpture is one of a series situated around the walls of the temple\u2019s central structures showing NarasiMha in various poses, for example as an archer; participating in the swing festival; worshipping at the shrine to PuruSottama in Puri; or receiving the god Surya\u2019s garland of command. The reliefs were, according to a possibly contemporary text, carved by Visvanatha Mahapatra, who specialised in such royal scenes, and GaNga Mahapatra, the head sculptor.\nScale reflects hierarchy and normally the king is the largest figure, but in this finely-carved relief NarasiMha, who is shown without his jewellery and whose sword rests on the ground, is depicted smaller than his guru. Tantric sects, whose yogic practices and secret rites could not be learned from texts alone but required initiation by a guru, gave the teacher god-like status. The guru is probably Acaryaraja, a Vaishnava Brahmana of the Vatsa-gotra lineage. His hand is in a teaching gesture while the king sits thoughtfully holding a palm-leaf manuscript. Behind them is an Orissan temple hall and below the king\u2019s warriors stand in relaxed poses. \n\nNick Barnard",
