This shows the actor in the role of Boniface  Chr\u00e9tien in Le Mecure-galant. \n\nThe lithographer is not named but all the lithographs appear to have been published by Robert Sayer, London (1772).\n\nPierre Louis Dubus, called Preville, was the son of a Parisian tradesman and began his career as a travelling player before taking leading comic roles in Strasbourg, Rouen, Dijon and Lyons. He made his Paris debut in 1753 and continued to perform with great success until his retirement in 1786. Under his stage name, Preville, he became a leading actor at the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise. \n\nThis company was founded by a decree of Louis XIV on 24 August 1680 to merge the only two Parisian acting troupes of the time, the troupe of the h\u00f4tel Gu\u00e9n\u00e9gaud and that of the h\u00f4tel de Bourgogne. The repertoire at that time consisted of the collection of theatrical works by Moli\u00e8re and Jean Racine, along with a few works by Pierre Corneille, Paul Scarron and Jean Rotrou. Its first theatre was cited at the H\u00f4tel de Gu\u00e9n\u00e9gaud.",
