            "public_access_description": "This is an original artwork for a fashion illustration by Marcel Fromenti for The Lady, a weekly magazine for women published since 1885. At the time it was made, Fromenti was the main artist for The Lady's fashion articles. The glamorous women in his drawings modelled both couture and high-end ready-to-wear garments with equal panache and elegance. Couture dresses and suits by leading Paris and London couturiers such as Christian Dior, Pierre Balmain and Norman Hartnell were drawn with the same flair as designs from British ready-to-wear labels such as Susan Small, Roecliff & Chapman, and Marcus. The articles described the fashion developments of their day in simple, accessible terms that contributed greatly to The Lady's popularity with its readers. Pencil notes record the designers, fabric and colour details, alongside technical instructions to the printers as to how these images should be incorporated into the printed page and at what scale.\n\nThis drawing of two London evening gowns pairs a gown by the established couturier Norman Hartnell alongside one by John Cavanagh, who opened his fashion house in 1952. Norman Hartnell launched his couture career in London in 1923, specialising in romantic, ultra-feminine gowns and evening wear. Although he also designed daywear and tailoring, Hartnell is most famous as the designer of extravagant state evening gowns worn by Queen Elizabeth II, her mother, and other members of the Royal Family between 1935 and 1979. His evening gowns were often designed with full crinoline skirts. Here, the front of the skirt is caught close to the body with ruching, allowing the fullness of the skirt to blossom out behind. A halter neck extends down to form a large bustle bow to accentuate the back fullness further. John Cavanagh's slender sheath of textured lace with a swathed side train at the hip offers an alternative evening silhouette as well as providing a striking contrast to the Hartnell.",
