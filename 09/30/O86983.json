They have tied up their hair to keep it out of the machinery and wear goggles to protect their eyes from the sparks. A leaflet issued by the Ministry of Labour said: 'The average woman takes to welding as readily as she takes to knitting once she has overcome any initial nervousness due to sparks'.\n\nNevinson painted landscapes and urban and industrial subjects. He was also an accomplished printmaker. Around 1912 and 1913 he studied in Paris and absorbed the influences of the new developments in European art, especially Cubism and Futurism. He produced this series of prints as one of the conditions for his appointment as an official war artist. He also made paintings of several of the subjects he depicted in this series.",
