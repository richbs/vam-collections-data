This one was hung in the Ostrich Hotel at Castle Acre near Swaffham, Norfolk, around 1820. It might have been chosen for its relevance to local sights and scenes. Castle Acre contained a number of ruinous Gothic buildings, notably the Priory church, for which it was well known. At a time when tourists were often interested in ruins and antiquities, a Gothic wallpaper would have been an apt choice of decoration for a hotel. In 1841 the architect and designer A.W.N. Pugin wrote dismissively of 'What are commonly termed Gothic pattern papers for hanging on walls, where a wretched caricature of a pointed building is repeated from skirting to cornice, door over pinnacle and pinnacle over door'. He noted that there was 'a great variety of these miserable patterns', and that the style was 'a great favourite with hotel and tavern keepers'.",
