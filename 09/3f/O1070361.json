Full Citation:\n\n\u201c<b>94 Oliver Cromwell</b>\n(b. 1 599 d.1658) \n<b>pseudo c.1653</b>\nP22-1941 \n\n<b>Oval 46 x 36mm</b> \n\nFeatures in short indistinct hatches of brown and sanguine with touches of white over a yellowish-cream carnation ground; hair in brown wash lined in darker colour; collar in white over thin grey wash; armour in grey wash with white lights and gold rivets; plain opaque grey background; on vellum put down on pasteboard. \n\n<b>Condition:</b> Very little of the original face-painting has survived; repainted in at least two stages with thick gouache; the only areas of substantial integrity are about the eyes and under the chin. Dr Williamson recorded in a letter to C F Bell, 15 April 1942, when the Joseph miniatures were first put on view at the Museum, that Samuel Joseph had bought most of his best things from Wertheimer, and that Wertheimer employed a Mr Ernest Lloyd to 'touch up and to enhance' faded miniatures in his collection (see Appendix 1). Alyn Williams performed similar services. \n\n<b>Signed:</b> Not signed. \n\n<b>Frame:</b> Twentieth-century silver-gilt oval locket with plain convex back and the sides curving inward to the bezel, which holds the shallow domed glass; hanger of deep D-section bifurcating into tight S- bends and diminishing spirals of three turns (cf. also Cat. Nos 65, 72 and 80 [P.20-1941; P.19-1941; P.21-1941], all re-framed by the Josephs). Inscribed on a label packed in the frame: <i>33/John Hoskins/Oliver Cromwell</i>. \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> SS Joseph ; Mrs Emma Joseph, his widow, by whom given to the Museum, May 1941.\n \n<b>Literature:</b> <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 10. \n\nTechnically the painting of the background and the use of a rather loose pasteboard made from laminated paper as the support for the vellum are strongly reminiscent of miniatures certainly painted in the eighteenth century. The mid-eighteenth century saw the beginning of the boom in 'historic portraits' , and a number of the standard images of Cromwell are independently datable to this broad period. The present piece, allowing for its very poor condition, seems to be, or to have been converted into, a variant of the famous Cooper Cromwell in the Buccleuch Collection. The artist or the restorer has made changes in the eyes, in the direction of the gaze, in the height of the head and in the position of the shoulders: such changes are notoriously difficult to effect without damaging the likeness, and here the likeness has slipped to the extent that an alternative identification (Robert Lilburne, 1613-1665) has even been proposed. This is extremely unhelpful, since the Lilburne iconography is as confused as that of the Cromwells, and such guesses are difficult to refute. \n\nThere is nothing to be said for the old attribution to Hoskins. The miniature is not identifiable in any of the nineteenth-century literature or exhibitions attributed to Hoskins or to Cooper.\u201d\n<u>Victoria and Albert Museum, Department of Engraving, Illustration and Design and Department of Paintings, Accessions 1941</u>, London: HMSO, 1954.\nThe full text of the record is as follows:\n\n<b>'COOPER, Samuel (1609-1672), In the style of\n</b>...\n\nMiniature portrait of Oliver Cromwell.<i>\nOn parchment on card.
