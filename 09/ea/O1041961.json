Mr. Driffield, vicar of Feering, Essex.  Constable describes the visit in a letter of 3 July 1814 to Miss Bicknell, the original of which is in the Library of the Victoria and Albert Museum, No. D.236-1888.  In addition to the passages quoted above (Nos. 124 [D.228-1888], 127 [234-1888]) the following are relevant to the sketch book \u201cI have been absent from this place [East Bergholt] for near a fortnight, on a visit to the Rev. Mr. Driffield at Feering near Kelvedon\u2026 Some time ago, I promised him a drawing of his house and church at Feering; and, during my visit, he had occasion to visit his living of Southchurch, and I was happy to embrace his offer of accompanying him; by which I saw much more of the county of Essex than I ever had before, and the most beautiful part of it; as I was at Malden, Rochford, South End, Hadleigh, Dansbury, etc. etc\u2026.I have filled as usual a little book of hasty memorandums of the places which I saw, which you will see\u201d.  The water-colour \u2018Feering Church and Parsonage\u2019 in the Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester, was a result of this visit.  The Minories, Colchester has acquired a page from the same sketch-book, washed with a blue tone; it is inscribed by the artist <i>18 June feering Bury mill</i>.\nWith the drawings Nos. 124-128 [see above] is another page from the same sketch-book, with no drawing on it and no Museum number but bearing on one side a copy with variations, in ink, not in the artist\u2019s hand, of the inscription of No. 128 [231-1888], and inscribed in pencil on the other <i>M.C.</i> [Maria Constable].",
