Instead of a sharply cut jacket there is a loosely-fitted bolero with distinctively puffed sleeves. The skirt, though simple in shape, is composed of an unexpected patchwork of leather and knitted panels. After training at Middlesex University and London College of Fashion, Szczotarska spent two years as an assistant to Martin Margeila in Paris. She returned to London in 2000 to set up her own label, and has since won Top Shop New Generation support from the British Fashion Council. Described as \u2018intellectual chic\u2019 by the press, Szczotarska produces clothes with a simple elegance, but often with unusual construction details.",
