The design is on a stiff sheet of cream-coloured paper with a very smooth, shiny surface.  It is stuck onto the page of an album and beneath it, on a separate small piece of paper, is pasted a dated inscription by W Harry Rogers.  The album consists of a green buckram cover, with gold tooled decoration around the inner edge of the front cover and endpapers with a watered pattern.
