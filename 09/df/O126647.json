The belt is known as a 'brezi', from the Albanian word 'brez', meaning 'race' or 'progeny', and the term refers to the function of the belt as a symbol of motherhood. A 'brezi' is an important element in the ritual leading up to marriage and subsequent motherhood, as the bride-to-be wears it as she displays her dowry. The clasp ('borchia') which fastens the belt is decorated with the image of the local patron saint, in this case St George.\nThe belt and clasp are traditionally the most important pieces of jewellery worn by the women of this community.",
