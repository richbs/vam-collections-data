These sets were developed during the early Momoyama period (1573-1615) when a mid-day meal was added to the daily routine. Picnic sets went from being practical items to decorative items by the Edo period (1615-1868), as seen in this example. Most picnic sets consist of a tiered box, a number of trays and a pair of bottles.\nThis set is decorated with drying rice sheaves recently harvested by the local farmhands. Often too poor to purchase rice poorer households had to survive on millet. Such a scene is a common rural motif.",
