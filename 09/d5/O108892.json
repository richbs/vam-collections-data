The fall of many of the arches is attributed to their having been built by Hindoo architects. The Hindoos have never built arches before, and being ignorant of the principle of voussiors, adopted that of their own domes, viz. Horizontal converging courses closed by long slabs at the top. This construction is clearly apparent in the view of the arches in plate 10. \n\nRef: Delhi, Agra, and Rajpootana, Illustrated by Captain E.C. Impey, Cundall, Downes and Co.
