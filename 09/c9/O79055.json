Both mirrors have a pagoda-shaped top, a central alcove with a pierced, domed top and side borders of naturalistically carved branches and foliage. Both have a lower ledge carved with rockwork and a double flight of steps leading up to a platform with Chinese fencing.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe original japanned (painted) decoration imitating oriental lacquer survives. The lacquer is in particularly good condition on the steps leading up to the platform, which are japanned in green and then outlined in gold to represent crazy paving.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nBoth the decoration and the content are inspired by the fashion for Chinoiserie which was particularly sought after for garden buildings and the furnishings of ladies' bedrooms and dressing rooms. The seated Chinese figure above the alcove is flanked by dragons which are similar to those on the four corners of the Chinese bed from Badminton House.",
