At the apex is a profile of the actor Amitabh Bachchan who develops his role as the 'angry young man' in this film. His portrait has been 'painted-over' in shades of pink, the emphasis  is placed on his large eyes, heavy eyelid and large lips which have become his trademark. \n\nBelow him are figures which represent character types. On the left hand side is the mother figure, on the right is the 'brother figure and the two wives/girlfriends in the middle. The main portrait contrasts with the rest of the poster which is 'painted-over' in shades of yellow. The title runs across the bottom of the poster, the typography is large and particularly distinctive.",
