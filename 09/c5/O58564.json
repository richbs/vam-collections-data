The front legs and arm balusters are turned and fluted; the four rails under the seat are carved with flutings; and the four stretchers are moulded above and below and carved with a series of upright channels.\n\nFrom Yorkshire.  Early 17th century.\nGiven by T. Mackenzie Fowler, Esq.\n\nThe chair formerly belonged to the family of Midgley, of Leeds, and was inherited by the donor, who presented with it a contemporary copy on parchment of a grant of arms to Robert Midgley, of Leeds, dated 1709.  (Reg. No. E. 3745-1923).\n\nThe surface of the chair has been painted, evidently in the middle of the 19th century, when the words 'Sursum Corda':  'Johnathan Midgley, 1625,' and the coat of arms of Midgley on the back were added.\n\nFrom:  H.
