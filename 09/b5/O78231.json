There  was fierce competition among their promoters to achieve the biggest, the most topical or the most realistic. To guide the audience, printed 'keys' or diagrams identifying and explaining the events and personalities depicted were produced and sold. This woodcut print is a typical example.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nPatriotic paintings with themes showing British military victories were naturally very popular. The defeat at Seringapatam of Tipu, Sultan of Mysore by General George  Harris (1746-1829)  in 1799  was no exception, especially since Tipu had unwisely tried to ally himself with the French. France was Britain's main colonial rival in India and her enemy in the Napoleonic wars.\n\nPeople\nSir Robert Ker Porter (1777-1842) made his name with vast panoramas of topical battles exhibited at the Lyceum in London. The Storming of Seringapatam was a semi-circular painting measuring no less than 120 feet across. He was also commissioned by the British Government  as a propaganda artist. In a series of prints and drawings he luridly portrayed the deeds of Napoleon in his Egyptian campaign.  Following the success of the panoramas at the Lyceum, in 1804 Alexander I, Tsar of Russia (ruled 1801-1825), appointed Ker Porter as Historical Painter to his court in St Petersburg.",
