Bush photographed his subjects by attaching a camera to the passenger side window of his car, often while travelling at more than 60 mph. In these images, Bush captures other drivers in action, mostly unaware of the camera. While maintaining their anonymity, each driver\u2019s character is revealed not only through his or her expression, posture and clothing, but also, more importantly, by their choice of car. 'Vector Portraits' explores the inseparability of car culture and American life. They also represent the American ideals of freedom, mobility and independence, providing a unique personal space that is simultaneously private and public. In this sense, the photographs explore the ambiguous division between public and private space that comes with driving a car.",
