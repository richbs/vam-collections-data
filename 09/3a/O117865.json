The textile has a dropped, reversed repeat, taking up the entire loom width of 52 cm. The largest flower in each group is repeated twice in shades of blue and white and then twice in shades of mauve and white. Tabby with cannell\u00e9 ground (floating for 5 shoots of the weft) brocaded with coloured silks, unbound, and metal thread, bound in twill. Silver fil\u00e9 thread, paired shoots and silver strip. Silver strip and silver thread (loosely S bound strip on a white silk core) used together. The metal threads are bound in 4/1 twill by a proportion of the cannell\u00e9 warp threads. In some parts of the textile the brocaded silk threads have puckered the ground fabric, presumably because they were inserted too tightly by the weaver or because the selvages were under too great a tension in the loom.

Spitalfields was the heart of the English silk industry in the 18th century. Wealthy men and women bought rich, patterned fabrics (sometimes decorated with costly metal threads) for their waistcoats, dresses and furnishings, as well as unpatterned silk taffetas and silk satins. Families with modest disposable incomes could afford smaller items, such as ribbons and handkerchiefs.\n\nSilk fashions changed rapidly. The naturalistic rosebuds and exotic blooms of this design, which are arranged asymmetrically on a yellow ground, would be replaced in the 1760s and '70s by a fashion for stripes in many different forms crossed by stylised bunches of flowers.",
