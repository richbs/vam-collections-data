Note: researchers may use the terms applique and tambour when searching for this category of textile even though they are incorrect.\nThe pattern is a series of horizontal bands.  From the bottom:\n[1] slight evidence of a black band\n[2] orange ground with red leaves and white embroidery forming an undulating line either side of which are black rosettes or green or blue star shaped flowers with red berries and green tracery.\n[3] red band\n[4] Deep band.  Black ground with thick white embroidered meander with large, composite, multi-coloured blossoms and red and yellow pointed flowers and round flower; there are light blue leaves and lots of small white tendrils.\n[5] red band\n[6] as [2]\n[7] black band\n[8] pieced; red ground with seven and a half left-facing botehs.  Dark petals at the base and at the top with blue, purple and turquoise flowers and many white tendrils.\n[9] black ground.  A strip of red cotton has been sewn along the upper edge. The black band extends a little on both sides.  There is a black and white silk cord along the right hand edge. There is one along the left hand side and there is also a black ground border and then a vertical border with a red ground and inward pointing botehs, as in band [8]. The upper part of this has been folded back at an angle so that the left hand side of this border slopes and is wider at the bottom than it is at the top. A red cotton binding has been stitched to the back and there are 7 metal hooks with evidence of an 8th at the top.\nThe seams are covered with red and white silk with a line of black and white silk between bands [7] and [8].\nEmbroidery thread: 2S silk: green, red, white, light blue, yellow.\nInset wool: black, red, orange, turquoise, dark blue, grey, light blue, purple.",
