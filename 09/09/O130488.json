The front and back with three panels. The front feet shaped on the inner with a concave cut-out.\n\nMason's mitres on front, and panelled back.\nOriginal nailed iron lock and ring with good iron stain (hasp missing).\nPlain sawn very knotty oak, with planed surfaces of varying smoothness. The rails and some panels quartered.\nThe angled grooves that hold the ends into the front and back were probably cut with a plough plane, run out at the top (which is why the channel shallows to nothing)\n\nNote that front and back are made up, and lid removeable (doubling as a dough trough) but ends and bottom demountable. The end lower rail and 3 planks slot into an angled groove, then held firmed by an outer clamped rail passing through its own. The planks with bird's mouth joints to ensure a snug fit for grain/flour. Note the distinctive form of the solid end lower rail which tenons into the legs, provides a bird's mouth joint for end plank above it and overlaps base boards.\n\nNote some glue repairs.\nNote chiselled assembly marks on the stiles of front and back sections\n\nNote that front left panel has guilloche and round bead pattern in very low relief (possibly raised scarring after a chisel and punch have been used) suggesting that it has been reused (after 1600).\nLeft upper rail has sapwood decay.\n\nKeyhole shape looks to be 16th century",

Chiselled assembly marks assisted the process. It could thus be moved from room to room inside timber-framed farmhouses as the need arose. These individual boards have been carefully shaped along their edges to fit tightly together in a V shaped tongue and groove (what Millar calls V-groove and chamfer).  (Millar says that the 'twybill' or 'axe-adze' was used for forming grooves on the edges of planks.) Its stout construction using riven oak, demountability and tight fitting joints explain the usefulness of such containers for storing precious grain at home, safe from pests.\n\nNote that the pegs all seem to be replacements, and that the front left panel has 'embossed' (or is it painted?) renaissance guilloche and bead pattern (post-1550) suggesting that this timber has been reused. The use panelled front and back probably indicates that the ark was made after 1550. Ironwork all seems original.\n\nThe distinctive, decorative cut-out on the front legs derives from a much earlier type of chest, cf. the Ditchling (Sussex) church, or Little Canfield church (Essex) chests, usually dated to the 13th century, but such survival may not be surprising given the conservative character of such utilitarian objects.",

The front consists of wide stiles or 'standards' with a long mortice-groove down their inner edges, with one or more horizontal boards clamped  between. Arks, derived from Latin arca, chest (or hutches, derived from French huche, chest, as they may have been more usually known in southern England) used this technique well into the 17th century. They were used to store grain, meal or bread at home in the period, and the concave top was normally removeable and able to be turned over to form a kneading trough (or, with the help of two poles a hand barrow). They tend to be constructed from riven (or split) oak.
