[Rosenberg III, 3938, d] \n\nExhibitions:\n1862 Art Treasures exhibition held at the South Kensington Museum (later the V&A)\n\nTall standing cups such as this were amongst the grandest objects a goldsmith could produce. Displayed on buffets, they looked spectacular at a distance, and were used on grand ceremonial occasions. They were also often presented as gifts. Peter Schleich was a specialist in standing cups, and his other known pieces follow a similar pattern of embossed strapwork, fruit and masks. Here, the cartouches depict the story of Cephalus, who accidentally killed his wife, Procris, with a javelin given to him by the goddess Diana. \nAt the 1862 Art Treasures exhibition held at the South Kensington Museum (later the V&A), the lid was still on the cup to which it belonged: exhibition cat. no. 6309: a silver standing cup with horn body encased by six term figures - then the property of  F Davis Esq. and subsequently Baron Gustave de Rothschild's and Sir Philip Sassoon's collections, then to The Shroder Collection. \nWalter Leo Hildburgh was one of the most dedicated and generous patrons in the history of the V&A. His name is not well-known outside the museum world, but his influence on the shaping of the collections was immense. Born in New York in 1876, he trained as a scientist. Initially his collecting interest was ethnography, but after 1914 he turned to the decorative arts. His tastes were eclectic, but he developed his closest links with the Departments of Metalwork and Sculpture. Encouraged by successive Keepers of Metalwork, he began to accumulate European silver, with the gaps in the existing collections in mind. He travelled widely on collecting expeditions, usually recording when and where he bought something, but not (frustratingly for posterity) from whom. \nHildburgh's abiding passion was the art of Spain and Portugal, and it is no coincidence that the Museum holds one of the finest collections of Hispanic silver in the world. He also fell into the charming habit of giving the Museum presents at Christmas and on his own birthday.  In some ways he was a shadowy figure, living frugally in a flat surrounded by what he called `the Museum mistakes', and devoting all his resources to collecting, but he is known to have been a keen skater. From 1924 when he offered the first objects to the Museum on loan, to 1956 when the huge  collection was bequeathed, Hildburgh was  part of the Museum landscape. We continue to benefit from his generosity; his will set up a fund for future purchases, administered in the spirit of his earlier acquisitions.\n\nLabel info 2002: Large and impressive cups of this kind were made for display. It originally would have had a cover. The three scenes embossed on the cup are from an ancient Greek myth in which Cephalus accidently kills his wife, Procris, with a javelin given to him by the goddess Diana. The slender proportions of the cup and the combination of classical subjects with densely chased and etched ornament is typical of the mannerist designs of south German silversmiths during the late 16th century.",
