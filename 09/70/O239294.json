Like this example, the frieze often had a bold pattern.\n\nPeople\nWilliam Shand Kydd (1864-1936) had worked for the wallpaper manufacturer Hayward & Son before setting up his own wallpaper business in London in 1891. In the early years he designed most of the papers himself. They were highly praised at the time for their originality, confident design, and beautiful colouring. The company became very successful and supplied papers to the most fashionable London furnishing shops. \n\nMaterials & Making\nThis frieze was produced by printing the outlines of the pattern from a carved wood block, and then filling in the colour using stencils. Stencils had been used to apply colour to wallpapers in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. In the 1880s it was reintroduced to commercial wallpaper production by Hayward & Sons. Shand Kydd learned the technique when he worked for the company and went on to use it for many of the wallpapers and friezes produced by his own firm.",
