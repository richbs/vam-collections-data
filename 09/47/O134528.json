            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of British Oil Paintings 1820-1860</i>, Ronald Parkinson, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1990, p. 135\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"LANCE, George (1802-1864) \n\nBorn Little Easton, near Colchester, Essex, 24 March 1802, son of an army officer. Pupil of B R Haydon, with Charles Landseer, from 1816, and entered RA Schools 1820. Exhibited 38 works at the RA between 1828 and 1862, 135 at the BI 1824--64, and 47 at the SBA 1824-35. Most of his paintings \n\nwere still-life, usually fruit, but he occasionally showed portraits and subject pictures. Called by the Athenaeum critic (17 May 1856, p622) 'the very prince of fruit-painters'. Died Sunnyside, near Birkenhead, Merseyside, 18 June 1864. His studio sale was at Christie's 27 May 1873. There is a miniature portrait of him by Thomas Carrick in the V&A (Pl-1953). His daughter, Miss E Lance, was also a painter of fruit, exhibiting at the RA 1859-61; Sir John Gilbert and William Duffield were his pupils. \nLIT: \tArt Union 1847, p96 (with engr portrait after G Clint): Art Journal 1857, pp305-7; Illustrated London News 21 December 1861, pp647-8 (with engr portrait); Art Journal 1864, pp242-3 (obit) \nFruit \n895-1877 Neg 72356 \nCanvas, 85.1 X 111.1 cm (331/2 X 43 \u00be ins) \nSigned and dated 'G L 1848. 1849' on edge of table to r Bequeathed by C T Maud 1877 \nThe view in the left background was identified by one of the artist's descendants in 1935 as Preston Hall, Lancashire. It is more probably Preston Hall, Aylesford, Kent, the seat of Edward Ladd Betts who was a patron of Lance. Preston Hall was rebuilt in a Jacobean style for Betts in 1850; Lance presumably based his view on the architect's designs. In the catalogue of Betts's sale at Christie's 30 May 1868, lot 62 was 'The Uninvited Guest: a view of Preston Hall in the background'; in another edition of the catalogue, lot 62 is described as \"A Peacock, Vase of Flowers and Fruits, under an archway, a view of a house in the background'. Presumably the former is the corrected title; according to Redford (Sales) a picture called 'The Unwelcome Guest' was also sold by Isaac, in 1879 (sale untraced). Consequently, and because of the description of the peacock and archway, it cannot be identified with the present painting, but must have been similar. \n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
