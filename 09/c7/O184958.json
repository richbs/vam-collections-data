The elections took place between the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and the reunification of East and West Germany.\n\nThe Alliance for Germany was an opposition coalition formed on the 5th of February 1990 in then West-Berlin to stand for the 'Volkskammer' (People's Chamber) election. It got the majority of the seats and thus formed the interim-government until reunification, with Lothar de Maizi\u00e8re as Minister President.\n\nThe DSU, CDU (Christian Democratic Union) and DA (Democratic Awakening) were part of the Alliance. The political aims (reunification of Germany and reconstitution of the federal states) were mainly determined from the West German side of the CDU. The then Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl appeared at many election campaign activities for the East German CDU.\n\nThe DSU became the reservoir for conservative forces and positioned itself politically to the right of the CDU. The slogan on this poster reads: 'Deutschland braucht Freiheit statt Sozialismus' - 'Germany needs Freedom instead of Socialism'.",
