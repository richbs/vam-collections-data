Her tapestry tutors were Fiona Mathison and Maureen Hodge, both former directors of the Dovecot Studios.  Barker is particularly interested in the use of colour and its emotional impact on the viewer.  Working on small designs which combine an exuberant use of drawing, painting and collage, Barker attempts to recreate and capture the immediacy of the painterly mark in her woven tapestries.  'Dappled Circle Scarlet' explores the illusion of space, depth of field and movement reminiscent of the play of sunlight over latticed ironwork.  It was inspired by a study trip to Egypt and retains the circle motif that Barker has been working with for many years 'but this time as a more solid form as a base for the dappled light pattern.  The grey ripples act as a softer, subtler sense of movement within the composition'.",
