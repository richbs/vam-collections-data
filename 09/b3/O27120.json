Some pieces might interlock, but most of the puzzle was just pushed into place. This meant that it would not stay in one piece very easily. To solve this, the outer edges of some puzzles, like this example, had long interlocking pieces that would hold the whole puzzle together. The reverse of this puzzle has a map of England and Wales. It was quite common for a puzzle to have two sides. These were called double dissection.",
