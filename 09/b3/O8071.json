Tiles of this type were exported to England for use in prestigious buildings. Later in the16th  century, religious persecution resulted in the departure from Antwerp of many potters, including Jacob Janssen and Jaspar Andries, who arrived in Norwich in 1567.  They are believed to have produced the first tin-glazed earthenware in England, including  paving tiles and pharmacy jars.\n\nPeople\nThe initials that appear on the tile are those of Sir Nicholas Bacon (1509-1579), Lord Keeper of the Great Seal to Elizabeth I (ruled 1558-1603).  Although the tile includes the arms of the Whaplode family, Sir Nicholas had no right to these, since they had married into a different branch of the Bacon family. The V&A's tile is one of several identical tiles that are said to have come from Gorhambury, near St  Albans in Hertfordshire, the house built by Sir Nicholas between 1563 and 1568. The Gorhambury tiles are of a type generally attributed to The Netherlands, but the presence in Norwich of the Antwerp potters Janssen and Andries at the very time that the floors were being laid at Gorhambury suggests that they may have been responsible.",
