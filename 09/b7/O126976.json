From the late 15th century the international trade in beads became increasingly dominated by glass beads produced by manufacturers in Venice, Holland, Bohemia and Moravia. European glassmakers were even able to reproduce forms of beads made of organic materials \u2013 stone, bone, shell \u2013 which had previously been sourced from other parts of the world.\n\nThis small spherical bead is made of white shell, probably from the South Pacific. It was given to the Museum in 1904 by Moses Lewin Levin, a London bead merchant who ran an import-export business between 1839 and 1913. The business specialised in European glass beads intended for use in trade in Africa but this shell bead suggests it also kept examples of beads made of organic materials.",
