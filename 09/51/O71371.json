The bearded figure of Christ, shallow holes drilled in the eyes to represent pupils, wears the torse and the shroud draped from his right shoulder and over his right arm. His right hand is raised in blessing and he holds in his left hand the cross-staff and banner of the Resurrection, symbolizing his victory over death. He steps with his right foot from the tomb, which is shown resting on uneven ground. He steps onto the back of a soldier who lies face down, and who wears a basinet, a tippet of mail, a jupon and a belt, holding in both hands a battle-axe on the ground beside him. A similar seated figure of a soldier is represented asleep sitting on the inside edge of the tomb, his left leg over the front and resting his right elbow on a square shield which he holds with his left hand. Another sleeping soldier is shown behind the tomb on the left of the panel, leaning on the edge of the tomb with his arms. \n\nThe right arm and the bottom of the shaft of the cross-staff and the bottom left corner of the panel are missing. No paint remains on the panel. The back of the panel bears four rectangular-shaped lead plugs and the remains of latten wires.",

Most panels show more than three soldiers. Resurrection panels are among the most common and were clearly one of the most popular of all the subjects to be carved by the alabastermen.\n\nThe placing of one of Christ's feet actually on a sleeping soldier is the attitude usually represented by the alabaster carvers, but very rarely shown in continental art of the period. It has been suggested the influence of contemporary mystery plays was responsible both for the conventional stone tomb, instead of the original cave-like sepulchre described in the gospels, and for the action of the risen Christ.",
