These were used to line the walls of cold baths (for example in turkish baths), dairies, shops and cellars. The most common use, however, was to line fireplaces.\n\nMaterials & Making\nAn important development in the production of tiles came in the 1750s, when John Sadler and Guy Green developed a process for transferring a printed image to the tiles. This was done by means of a gelatinous pad or 'bat', which was used to pick up oil from a woodblock or engraved copper plate, and deposit it onto the surface of glazed tile blank. Pigment dusted over the tile would then adhere to the oily residue. In 1756, Sadler and Green claimed that they could decorate more than 1200 tiles in a period of six hours using the process, while it would have taken more than 100 tile-decorators to do the work in the same time.\n\nDesign & Designing\nPublished prints were often copied to provide decorative designs for ceramics. The design of this tile is derived from a drawing book published around 1756 by John Bowles & Son, an important source used in the decoration of tin-glazed tiles at the time.",
