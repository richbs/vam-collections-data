The body is hand sewn on each side and there is a line of stitches at the upper leg and at the knee.  The lower arms and legs are of poured wax, with realistic indications of chubby arms and feet in contrast to the long and quasi-adult shape of the body.  The head has no hair and shows the seam line of the opening cut to insert the eyes: the scar left by the eye insertion would normally be covered by hair, whether a wig or inserted into the wax, although when babies were represented bonnets were often used (a series of small holes around the head indicate that originally either a wig or a cap was pinned into it).  The hazel eyes are of blown glass set in white; the brows, which are brown, are lightly modelled; the nostrils each contain a red dot. The moulded open mouth is curved in a slight smile, and is painted a dark red with two upper teeth moulded and painted white, and a moulded tongue.\n[dress] High-waisted dress, possibly for a child, of unlined white muslin printed with a sprigged flower motif in indigo blue.  The garment has a squared neckline with a drawstring front, and short sleeves which finish with two tucks at the hem; it fastens at the back with drawstrings at the neck and waist.\n[Spencer] Doll's spencer of unlined white cotton printed with a sprigged flower motif in red and blue.  It has a rounded neck, and close-fitting wrist-length sleeves gathered at the shoulder, and \nfastens with 4 pearl buttons and stitched buttonholes\n[Petticoat] Petticoat of white linen trimmed with lace. The garment has a rounded neck and armholes , all edged with lace, and a centre-seamed bodice front.  The gauged skirt is attached to the bodice at the waistline, and the garment fastens at the back with ties at neck and waist and a small pearl button and stitched buttonhole between.\nthis is a doll's petticoat but of the 1850-60 period and slightly too small for the doll, button will not do up\n[sock] Baby's ankle sock (one of a pair) knitted in beige mercerised cotton using a lacy trellis pattern with the sole, heel and toe in stocking stitch.\nlarge enough to fit a baby's foot\ncould have been made anytime during the 19th century\n[sock] Baby's ankle sock (one of a pair) knitted in beige mercerised cotton using a lacy trellis pattern with the sole, heel and toe in stocking stitch.\n[Baby's bonnet] Baby's bonnet of white cotton lawn, hand embroidered in speckle stitch, with drawn and cut work, and trimmed with two flounces of lace around the face and a single flounce around the neck.  The bonnet has internal strings within casings for adjustment to a closer fit, and fastens under the chin with tying strings of white cotton tape; it has been adapted to fit the doll's smaller head by taking a deep tuck around the crown.\n[box] Wooden box probably constructed in the 19th century; hinged along one edge and with two hooks and eyes along the opposite edge.  The box is slightly too narrow for the doll at the shoulders.\n[Doll's clothing] Long dress of white cotton broderie anglaise, with a rounded neck and short sleeves, and decorated at the waist with ribbon insertion, and a rosette of self fabric at the front and back.  The garment fastens at the back of the bodice with two pearlised buttons and stitched buttonholes\n[Doll's clothing] Petticoat, with a white cotton bodice and a white flannel skirt with a scalloped embroidered hem; the garment opens at the back with no fastenings\n[Doll's clothing] Bonnet of thick white cotton, with a wide brim and white tape ties",

A number of small ones inhabit dolls' houses such as the Nuremberg House, 1673, while slightly larger ones were used as manikins both in the fashion world and for dressing at home (the Powell family dolls, housed at BGM); there are records of life sized models beings created but these are generally famous men and women.  Large play dolls representing babies of the 18th century are very rare and until this doll was found, still in private hands, there were two known examples of near life sized baby dolls.  One, said to be the 'Little Dauphin 1796', is held by the Nantucket Historical Association and the other, still in private ownership, is said to be Caroline Harris, born 1798.  These two dolls, unlike the death mask infant model held by BGM were designed to be played with as toys, to be dressed and undressed.  There are judged to be play dolls because of the use of standard arms and legs with no attempt at being a portrait.",
