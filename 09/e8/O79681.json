The jewellery worn in towns, which is often Ottoman or western in style, is frequently very different from that worn by the nomadic Bedouin, whose characteristic silver jewellery is much better known today.  There were also differences in the jewellery worn by the different faiths of the region, although these were usually expressed in details of design and decoration rather than in overall function.\n\nThis pendant was described as a \u2018brooch worn by Druses\u2019 when it was acquired by the Museum in 1873.  It would have been worn hanging from a pin or clasp used to fasten a woman\u2019s shift in the centre of the front.",
