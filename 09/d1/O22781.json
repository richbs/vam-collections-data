Two main influences can be detected in Murray's work. His architectural training gave him the ability to rely on form alone for decorative effect. He was also very inspired by the subtle simplicity of Scandinavian design which he saw in the International Exhibition at Paris in 1925 and the Swedish exhibition in London in 1931.\n\nMurray was immediately promoted by the design pundits of the 1930s as Britain's main contributor to the International Modern movement. Murray adapted his designs to Wedgwood's existing technology, making much use, for example, of engine turning - a speciality of Wedgwood's first introduced by Joshiah Wedgood I in the late 18th century. His economy of design may also have contributed to his success, as due to their simplicity and economy of manufacture, many of his designs stayed in production throughout the Second World War.\n[Susan McCormack, 'British Design at Home', p.120]",
