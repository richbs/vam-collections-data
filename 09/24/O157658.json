Its proud creator, Jan-Baptiste I Verberckt (1735-1819), signed his early masterpiece that he made in his late twenties while still reading sculpture and drawing at the Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp. He was the nephew of the eminent woodcarver Jacques Verberckt (1704-71), who worked extensively at Versailles.  He studied with his famous uncle in Paris in about 1750, then returned to Antwerp to work with his father, whose mark has been employed on this ciborium.\n\nThe angel as figural stem of the bowl alludes to the appearance of an angel at the mount of Olives that marks the beginning of the Passion of Christ: \u201cAnd there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.\u201d (Luke 22:43).  The ciborium is decorated with an elaborate programme that shows scenes from the Book of Exodus in the Old Testament alongside personifications of the Christian virtues Hope, Faith and Charity on the base.\n\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes. Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",

He worked in his father's, Michiel Verberckt\u2019s workshop in Antwerp after the end of his apprenticeship. Rather than entering his own mark, he sometimes signed his work as in this case. The earliest known work with his own mark dates from 1771, and only in 1775 he took over his father\u2019s workshop.\n\nJan-Baptiste also received academic training, including life drawing and sculpture, at the Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp (1751-56 and 1760-67), and won a medal as best in life drawing in 1767. From that year onwards he taught at the Academy and after retiring as a silversmith was appointed <i>contr\u00f4leur</i><i> </i>for sculpture at this institution. The sculptural quality of this ciborium shows his academic training at a period of transition from opulent rococo forms and ornament to the Neoclassical style.",
