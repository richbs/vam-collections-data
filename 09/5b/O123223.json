When the photograph was taken many people attempted to flee oppressive communist regimes that existed in parts of Eastern Europe. Jim Lee describes this as brutal period in modern history. At this stage in his career Lee was very interested in making films and looked for a narrative within his work. He tried to capture 'film-clip' ideas that may have resembled the making of a movie. There is no obvious fashion reference in this shot other than what the boy is wearing.",

When the photograph was taken many people attempted to flee oppressive communist regimes that existed in parts of Eastern Europe. Jim Lee describes this as brutal period in modern history. At this stage in his career Lee was very interested in making films and looked for a narrative within his work. He tried to capture 'film-clip' ideas that may have resembled the making of a movie. There is no obvious fashion reference in this shot other than what the boy is wearing.",

His great breakthrough was meeting the diva of fashion editors, Anna Wintour, at that time the assistant fashion editor at Harpers and Queen, who he regularly collaborated with to produce some of his best work, which continued years later after they both moved to New York. Central to his work is the concept of telling stories which he creates using casts of three or three hundred and extraordinary locations and props. He has recently re-emerged as an active photographer working on numerous magazine editorials with top fashion stylists.\n\nJim Lee has recently moved seamlessly into directing TV commercials, his first film was for Levi\u2019s followed by several fashion and beauty commercials. In 2003/4 he had six photographs showing in the Ossie Clark retrospective at the Victoria and Albert Museum.\n\nsee also: http://www.jimleefilm.co.uk/",
