Even the Victoria and Albert Museum knew nothing about them, but the Print Department was sufficiently impressed to borrow them for a two-room exhibition at the museum between the Autumn and Winter of 1952. Eventually, with the help of Professor G.D.H. Cole, we were able to trace the first annual report published in 1853 and preserved in the Bodleian Library at Oxford. It appears to have been a philanthropic society for the education of the working classes with a strong religious flavour and the support of some Chartist elements. The aim being 'to unite all Christians endeavouring to elevate the adult masses and furnishing the materials requisite for the popular entertaining and instructive lecturing.' The use of cotton cloth being adopted to avoid paper duty.\n\nAltogether there appear to have been about 100 diagrams printed in large quantities at a cost of \u00a3663. of which 40 in my possession seem to be the only ones now extant. A large number of Mechanics, Institutions, Independent schools, Ragged schools, Young men's societies, and Church organisations co-operated in providing the facilities for 579 lectures in the year ending March 1853, with a total attendance of 122,000. 32 libraries for the 'industrious classes' were formed with a stock of 19,000 volumes. The organisation was financed by donations and small admission charges of 1d.-6d.\n\nIn the text of the report there are quaint references to the spread of infidelity, secularism or atheism. Also mentioned was Papist and Mormon propoganda, ribbonism, betting shops, dancing shops, gin palaces, schools of vice, penny theatres, of gaffs, 'all crowded and profitable'.
