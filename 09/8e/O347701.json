The lacquered wooden ladles are Japanese and painted in geometric designs. Dorment suggested they might have been purchased at Liberty's indicating that Gilbert was attracted to the decoration of objects, quite apart from any intention to realise them in silver. This would have pointed to a production date of ca. 1930. However they may date from an earlier period. Gilbert's early interest in intricate working is mentioned in an interview in the 'Easter Art Annual' of 1903. There is also an article of Hatton which includes an illustration showing sketch models for various objects, including spoons. Gilbert's passion for designing keys and spoons dates from the early 1890s.\n\nSir Alfred Gilbert (1854-1934) was a famous British sculptor of the late 19th century. He was also medallist, goldsmith and draughtsman. He was known for his inventiveness and characteristically used many different materials in the same work. He epitomised the movement known as the \u201cNew Sculpture\u201d, with a new focus on naturalistic forms. His many commissions included for example the celebrated figure of Eros, part of the Shaftsbury memorial.",
