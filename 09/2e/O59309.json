            "public_access_description": "This chair is of highly elaborate design and exceptional craftsmanship. At one time it was thought to have been made in Vienna, but recent studies have shown that it is close to furniture designed for the court in Madrid between about 1790 and 1795.  Even then, new ideas spread rapidly throughout Europe and it is not surprising that very similar designs were published in Vienna in 1806 by Gottfried August Pohle.\n\nThe chair is carefully designed to show a range of different tones in the woodwork and metal mounts. The high-relief carving of the central star, and the tiny carved 'swags' of fabric inside the upper arch of the back, are in darker wood against the lighter mahogany of the rest of the chair. The outlining of the legs and arms with metal fillets, and the ribbed gilt-bronze plaques at the top of the legs and the base of the arms, echo designs found for cabinet furniture throughout Europe at the time. It is rare, though, to find such a lavish use of metal mounts on a chair.\n\nThe horsehair fabric used to upholster the seat shows an unusual, complex, damask design. The complexity of the pattern suggests that, if the chair dates to the 1790s, the upholstery is not original and may have been replaced during or after the second quarter of the nineteenth century.",

This furniture is illustrated on p. 217 of the exhibition catalogue 'Espana entre dos siglos y la devolucion de Menorca' (Madrid, Museo Arqueologico Nacional, 2002).  He also made reference to a set of sofa and four armchairs in a private collection in Madrid (discussed and illustrated in the same catalogue, pp 418-20), and pointed out that the donor of the chair to the V&A was clearly Spanish.",
