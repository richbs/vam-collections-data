Symmetrical knot tied around two threads - it is possible that there is warp-sharing, that two knots are tied around three warp threads. 418 knots per sq. inch (6688 per sq. dm).\nSide finish: one cord oversewn with faded purple silk.\nEnd finish: Lower: 1cm plainweave, one row of warp twining and a warp fringe 7cm long with two rows of knots. Upper: 2.5cm plain weave with red wool; one row of weft twining with red/green wool; one row warp twining; a warp fringe 9cm long with two rows of knots.\nDesign: Field: dark blue ground with a small-scale Herati pattern with red diamonds outlined in green and with red and green leaves. There appears to be a colour change which may be an optical illusion resulting from a slight change in the size of the diamonds. Main border: red ground with an angular meander in green outlined in dark blue bearing blossoms in green and also in yellow. The side borders are slightly wider and there are slight design differences. Inner and outer borders: light blue ground with a small floral meander with red blossoms.",
