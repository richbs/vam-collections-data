His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nGr\u00e9try\u2019sZ\u00e9mire et Azor (1771) is based La Chaus\u00e9e\u2019s comedy, Amour par amour (1742), a variant on Charles Perrault\u2019s fairy tale Beauty and the Beast (1697).  Messel\u2019s production was first performed at the Bath Festival at the Theatre Royal in 1955.   His colourful, elegant and fantastic costumes and sets complement the otherworldliness of the story.\n\nAli, Zander's servant, provides much of the comedy in the opera.  Messel made the colourful turban from a length of cream cloth hand stitched into folds and stiffened with white paint, and adorned with feathers.",

Oliver Messel\u2019s production was first performed at the Bath Festival, Theatre Royal, Bath on 11 May 1955.  It was directed by Anthony Besch with choreography by William Chappel and featured Huguette Boulangeot as Z\u00e9mire and Michael S\u00e9n\u00e9cal as Azor.  \nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's theatre designs and other designs and artefacts.  The designs were briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being housed at the V&A from 1981 on indefinite loan.
