In 1862 it was in the collection of the earl of Chesterfield, who sold it to the earl of Dudley \"for upwards of \u00a32,000\" in 1868. Like its pair, the Chesterfield Vase is decorated with pastoral subjects taken from engravings by the French painter Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.\n\nLit. Mallet, 1965\n\nHILARY YOUNG\nAdams, Elizabeth. <u>Chelsea Porcelain</u>, The British Museum Press, 2001, 2nd. edition. pp 160-163\n'Other than the garniture of Dudley vases, the most celebrated examples made at  Chelsea in the Gold Anchor years must be the two known as the 'Foundling' and  the 'Chesterfield' vases.  The former was presented on 20 April 1763 to the  institution founded by Captain Thomas Coram for the relief of destitute children by  an anonymous donor, who was in fact Dr George Garnier, Apothecary-General to  the Army.  The pair to it was owned at one time by the Earl of Chesterield, and  these two magnificent pieces are now reunited in the Victoria and Albert Museum.   They are of elaborate rococo design, have ovoid bodies with flared trumpet necks  and domed covers, the knops of which are formed of gilt and white scrolls.  The  handles also are elaborately scrolled and picked out in gilding.  The vases have a  mazarine-blue ground of superb quality, and in a shaped and gilt-bordered  reserve on one side the 'Foundling' vase is decorated with a pastoral scene, 'Le  Berger R\u00e9compens\u00e9 ' from an engraving by R. Gaillard after Boucher.  The  Chesterfiled vase shows another scene from the same source, 'Le Panier  Myst\u00e9rieux '.  On both vases the opposite side is finely painted with exotic birds of  brilliantly coloured plumage in a lobed and moulded reserve, richly gilt.  The vases  are each 59.7cm high, and marked with a Brown Anchor.  Another pair of large  vases with a mazarine-blue ground, elaborate gilding and panels decorated with  scenes of the Death of Cleopatra  and the Death of Harmonia  and with exotic birds,  which are in the British Museum were recorded as 'made in the year 1762 under  the direction of Mr Sprimont'.  The were presented to the Museum by an unknown  donor on 15 April 1763.'",
