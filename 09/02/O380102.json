This type of lock is a rim lock, with its mechanism entirely enclosed in a case to be mounted on a door.\n\nThis lock has four bolts to control four levels of security. The mechanism of an identical lock in the Peter Phillips Collection was described by its owner as follows: \"The master of the house could select, by turning the small knob at the top of the lock, the number of bolts (1 to 4) that he wished to put into operation. When set at number 4, which gives the maximum security, locking the top four bolts is achieved by just the turn of the key, but four turns of the key are required to withdraw these, ie. one at a time! There is however literally a \"sting in the tail\" with the top bolt, the one last withdrawn, for it triggers off the twin anti-burglar bottom bolts, and these can only be unlocked by a reverse action of the correct key.\"\n\nThe Museum acquired this lock from the collection of John Charles Robinson. Robinson was appointed Curator of the Museum in 1853 at the age of 27. His appointment heralded a change in direction in the Museum's collecting activities. Robinson was a prolific collector and persuaded the Museum's first director, Sir Henry Cole, that historic works of art were as instructive to students as 'modern manufactures'. Under Robinson's guidance, some of the earliest purchases by the Museum included outstanding examples of European metalwork. The Musuem bought Robinson's own collection in 1879 for \u00a36800.",

Unlike later mortise locks that were built into doors and might match the overall decorative scheme of a room, rim locks could be removed when the owner moved house, to be fixed to a door in the new house. The bold proportions and twirling ornament are unmistakeably Baroque and would complement contemporary decoration in the house without necessarily matching exactly. On this example, even the inner workings are finely decorated.\n\nEnglish locksmiths were based mainly in London and the Midlands and were renowned for their ingenuity.
