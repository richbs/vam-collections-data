The weapons and armour of the period are realistically depicted, with all the combatants carrying traditional slung-swords (tachi) and short, guardless swords worn at the waist (koshigatana).\n\nThis book was produced during the peaceful Edo period (1600-1868), when the samurai had no battles to fight but were expected to maintain their warrior traditions. Books that told of the past glories of the samurai were produced in great numbers and many of the real characters from the tales became the stuff of national legend. They later featured prominently in numerous Noh and Kabuki performances as well as in prose. The samurai represented in those tales of long-past glorious battles represented the ideals of the samurai, namely unflinching bravery and self-sacrificing loyalty. The popularity of these war tales may even have helped foster the development of the samurai code of honour, bushido.",
