He developed a style that combined the neatness of Mughal and Persian miniatures with the delicacy of Japanese ink paintings. In his work, the artist often depicted sentimental and poetic scenes where characters typically personified places and moods. His painting style developed along the similar lines to that of the Bengal school of art which flourished between 1905 and 1920. \n\nIn 1947, after India's partition, Chughtai moved to Pakistan where he designed the nation's first postal stamp as well as the logo for Radio Pakistan and the Pakistan Television Corporation. The artist was the founding member of the Pakistan Art Council, Lahore and Karachi.",

            "historical_context_note": "Muhammad Abdur Rahman Chughtai (1897-1975), is often regarded as one of the most important Muslim painters of the Bengal School of Art. In his paintings, he sought to merge Persian and Mughal influences into a new style known as the Bengal School.\n\nBorn in Lahore (then India), Chughtai studied at Mayo School of Art, Lahore. He developed a style that combined the neatness of Mughal and Persian miniatures with the delicacy of Japanese ink paintings. In his work, the artist often depicted sentimental and poetic scenes where characters typically personified places and moods.\n\nIn 1947, after India's partition, Chughtai moved to Pakistan where he designed the nation's first postal stamp as well as the logo for Radio Pakistan and the Pakistan Television Corporation. The artist was the founding member of the Pakistan Art Council, Lahore and Karachi.",
