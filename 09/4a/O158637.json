Above this are 2 pairs of serrated leaves pointing towards a mid-point and forming a blue cross with a diamond.  Above this is the base of another 4-petalled flowerhead and above that gold leaves form an X-shape with a vertical blue line in the middle. These motifs repeat in a stripe.\n[2] Next to this, with interconnected elements, is another 4-petalled flowerhead with a pair of leaves above and on either side a downward sweeping trefoil-like flower and a pair of leaves.  Above this are 2 fine gold lines with a pair of horizontal flowers and then a 4-petalled rosette with on either side an upward pointing pair of trefoil flowers and leaves. Above this, 4 serrated leaves point towards the centre.\nFine gold stems and small curls may form an underlying pattern but it is difficult to see.\nBorder: on 3 sides, bias-cut.  There are many pieces from at least two fabrics, including one with a white bird alternating with a round pink blossom, a blue star-like blossom and a green bird.  The main fabric has ameander with a mauve flower, pink blossom, blue flower and white serrated flowers on additional stems. In one section there are three white flowers per stem.\nBinding: probably bias-cut black cotton.",
