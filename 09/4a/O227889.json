The gold is worked with rococo motifs with four inset enamels depicting: a male figure seated on clouds in classical armour with a trophy of arms (perhaps Mars); a seated female figure, also in military guise and also seated on clouds, whose shield shows three fleurs-de-lys (representing perhaps France); and two smaller enamels, each depicting trophies of arms. The whole object is encased in a cylindrical shagreen case.",

The ivory micro-carving of ships in a port resembles French pieces of the eighteenth century, such as a box and a finger-ring respectively, both in the Hull Grundy collection at the British Museum. The style of the enamels and the chased gold work implies a date of the mid-eighteenth century; the martial overtones could even reflect the start of the Seven Years War in 1756. Both the style and the iconography of the enamels imply the object is French.",
