            "physical_description": "The torch is made up of sixteen components. The tail cap has a slightly bevelled edge, a milled collar, a rubber O ring and screw thread. The inside of the cap contains a spare lamp wrapped in a piece of sponge rubber for protection. The battery spring sits within a chamfered, internal rim. The main part of the body is a cylindrical barrel. The middle section is finely cross hatched to facilitate the grip. The switch is near the head and is covered by a domed rubber seal which sits within an oval scooped depression. The head screws on to the end of the barrel and is of greater diameter to the barrel, gradually reducing to that of the main barrel at the rear. A milled collar, similar to that on the tail cap, is just below the rim of the head. The lamp sits in the end of the barrel and is secured by a rubber O ring seal. The barrel is a cylinder with a glossy black surface; the central section is scored with a series of knurled, longitudinal parallel lines to provide the grip. The tail cap assembly is secured by a screw thread and a rubber O ring to the base of the barrel. A spare lamp is housed within the tailcap and the spring is secured by two spring clips. The tailcap is circular with two concave sectors removed, and a triangular bracket with an eyelet to incorporate a key ting on a lanyard which is supplied with this model. The torch is sold in a black, matt plastic box which has rounded corners and a lid, hinged at the back. Inside, a plastic, vacuum moulded insert, the upper surface in imitation grey suede, contains the torch, lanyard and AAA battery in individual depressions,. diagonally placed. The battery supplied is branded UKAR and is coloured black  red, green and gold. (UKAR is the American brand name for British <i>Ever Ready</i> batteries).",
