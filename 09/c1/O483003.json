Each section comprises two plain panels with a pleated panel in the middle. The pleats on each panel are arranged in six groups (each group is made up of five pleats) with three groups facing to the left and three groups facing to the right. The pleats are caught up with a stitch at regular intervals along the length of the skirt giving a 'concertina' effect a little like smocking.\nThe skirt is secured into a blue cotton waistband with a matching loop at either end. A red a white printed cotton strip is knotted through each loop.\nThe shiny surface of the silk is probably due to calendering and/or the addition of methyl violet dye to the dye bath. It is unlikely to be gummed silk as the reverse is not the usual brown colour.",
