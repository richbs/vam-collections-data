The purple back of the thick paper on which the sketch is painted is inscribed in ink in another hand with the same date.  Also on the back are chalk scribbles, probably a child\u2019s drawing.\nThis sketch was made shortly before Constable left Suffolk; as noted by Farington (Greig, Vol. VII, p. 286), he arrived in London on 4 November.\nPencil studies of the lower plough seen from the same angle, and therefore perhaps made on the same occasion, are on pp. 68 and 69 of the sketch-book No. 132 [1259-1888].  Constable appears to have made use of No. 136 as a sketch for the plough seen in \u2018The Cornfield\u2019 (National Gallery) and for that in \u2018Stoke-by-Nayland\u2019 (Art Institute of Chicago).",
