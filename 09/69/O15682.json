The back of the dress is cut into a point, attached to the back of the collar and showing two triangles of naked flesh. A huge collar based on a rectangular form is made of triangles and squares. The collar is covered with narrow parallel rows of stitching which reinforce the fabric and allow the collar to keep its shape. Lanvin broke the long line of the dress by attaching two ribbons, equally covered with stitches, at either sides of the waist. The ribbons, once fastened, emphasise the waist, a new and important feature of 1930s fashion. By using one single, very strong colour in this dress, Lanvin achieved the simple, yet sculptural look of the 'classical' fashion of the period.\n\nSatin became popular in the 1920s when it was increasingly used for costumes in the silent cinema for its evocative character and the way it attracted the light. In Hollywood cinema, satin became the emblematic fabric of the 1930s Art Deco evening dresses and was mostly used in monochrome colours.",
