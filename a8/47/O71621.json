Although an impression printed from this block was identified as a 'woodcut' in an exhibition catalogue of 1907, for many years after the print was thought to be a linocut, and described as such in many publications about Matisse. It was only when the woodblock was found in the 1960s was it universally accepted that the print was in fact a woodcut.",

            "bibliography": "Timmers, Margaret (ed), <i>Impressions of the Twentieth Century: Fine Art Prints from the V&A's Collection</i>, London, V&A Publications, 2001\nThe full text of the entry is as follows: \n\n\"<b>Henri Matisse (1868-1954)</b> \n\n<i>Nu de profil sur une chaise longue (Le Grand Bois)</i> - 'Nude in Profile on a Chaise Longue (The Large Woodcut)', with the woodblock from which it was printed, 1906 \n\nMatisse, rivalled in reputation as a painted only by Picasso, is arguably the greatest French colourist of the twentieth century.  It is surprising therefore that the majority of his prints were executed in black and white.  This print was made shortly after Matisse's paintings caused a furore at the <i>Salon d'Automne</i>, Paris, in 1905, when the critic Louis Vauxcelles described a restrained sculpture in a room hung with paintings by Matisse, Roualt, Derain, Vlaminck and others as 'un Donatello parmi les fauves' (a Donatello among the wild beasts).  The implication was that the sculpture was by a real artist and the paintings by animals, a reference to their violent execution and experimental colour.  This woodcut, the largest and most arresting of three compositions in the medium by Matisse of the same period, translates the vigour of the colourful Fauve paintings into black and white in an astounding manner. \nThe block from which this image was printed consists of two thick joined planks of fruit-wood (probably pear-wood), from which Matisse cut away the wood around the design with knives, chisels and gouges leaving the stark lines, dashes and dots standing in relief.  It is the only woodblock cut by Matisse known to have survived.  It was acquired by art dealer Frank Perls, from the French publisher Ambrose Vollard, famous for his editions of fine prints by many leading artists. \nWoodcut was the first printmaking technique to be used for printing on paper, the earliest dating from the fourteenth century.  Throughout its long history woodcut was primarily used to communicate with the masses and it was just this demotic character combined with the direct simplicity of the medium that led a number of artists, especially some of the German Expressionists, to revive its use early in the twentieth century.  Matisse may also have been drawn to woodcut because of its sculptural affinities, for at the same period he was experimenting with sculpture as a vehicle for his vision.  That Matisse chose to exhibit this woodcut alongside his paintings, at the <i>Salon der Ind\u00e9pendants</i> in 1907 suggests that he considered it a work of considerable distinction and significance.\"\nAllegra Presenti, <u>Gouge: The Modern Woodcut from 1870 to Now</u> Los Angeles: Hammer Museum, 2008.\nExhibition catalogue",
