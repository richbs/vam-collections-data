            "history_note": "The design is for Anna Pavlova, probably as the Oriental Enchantress in the ballet Oriental Fantasy, which was seen in London at the London Opera House (later Stoll) in 1913, arranged by M Zajlich to music by 'celebrated Russian composers' and designed by Leon Bakst.   The ballet was probably intended to give Pavlova a work that cashed in on the public craze for orientalism that followed Bakst's designs for Scheherazade, created for the Diaghilev Ballets Russes in 1910, but the work does not seem to have become a regular part of Pavlova's repertory.  \nThe design came to the Museum as part of the Cyril Beaumont Bequest.",
