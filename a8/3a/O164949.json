They were exhibited in the V&A's Streetstyle exhibition of 1994 as a gay man's outfit worn in the mid-1950s. The donor worked in the shop 'Vince', and was a photographic model for its mail-order catalogue before becoming a successful full-time model.\n\nOpened in Newburgh Street in 1954 by Bill Green, 'Vince' was the first men's boutique opened in the Carnaby Street area. The distinctive merchandise was influenced by continental European styling and often ahead of its time. The clothes were designed to enhance a muscular or athletic male body, with closely fitting trousers and short-sleeved shirts. This attracted a certain type of clientele, which the actor John Gielgud described as \"Chelsea homosexuals, artists and theatricals, and muscle boys\".
