Morris Kestelman designed both costumes and set, and must have post-dated the designs mistakenly as 1945.\n\nThe plot concerns Michele and his wife Giorgetta living on a barge in the river Seine, and Michele's murder of the stevedore Luigi with whom Giorgetta is having an afair. After he has killed Luigi, Michele hides the body under a cloak. (un tabarro) When Giorgetta comes home, Michele removes the cloak, revealing her lover\u2019s dead body.\n\nSince the production took place when London was being bombed, the first-night programme noted that the audience would be alerted to an Air Raid warning by an illuminated sign in front of the footlights, asking those who decided to leave to do so quietly, but advising them to remain.",
