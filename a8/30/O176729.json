He trained as a goldsmith and developed skills in engraving crystals and dies. For Pope Clement VII he created his masterpiece, a crystal casket with 24 scenes from the life of Christ, now in the Palazzo Pitti in Florence.\nBelli was strongly influenced by Raphael and Michelangelo.\nHe had a facility to work very quickly, and Vasari noted that Belli had flooded the world with his works.\n\nPlaquettes are small plaques made of bronze, brass, lead or precious metals. They originated in the 1440s with the desire to reproduce coins and hardstone engravings from ancient Greece and Rome. Some were made as collector's pieces, to be viewed and displayed in private, and others for practical purposes. They also inspired designs in other media, from architecture to bookbindings.",
