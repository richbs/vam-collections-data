After the Second World War, Ascher Ltd designed different ranges of textiles for use at the top end of the fashion market, both in couture and high-class ready-to-wear garments. Ascher kept used samples such as this one to show prospective clients his wares, and as a record of his output.\n\nHe turned his attention to developing mixes incorporating mohair in 1956, seeking out manufacturers with a pedigree for excellence. In the case of woollens, he approached Scottish mills with his new ideas. In collaboration they created a range of dress and coat-weight mohairs. Like wool, mohair was warm and took colour well, but it had the advantage of being much lighter weight (a quality appreciated especially in the USA).  Some were blended with nylon. In 1957, haute couture promoted bulky look outerwear \u2014 mohair was the perfect vehicle for this effect.",

It was evidently the most successful of the six coats which he made in Ascher mohair in that season, appearing on the covers of French and American <i>Vogue</i> (October 1) described as 'A coat and a fabric, to stop traffic - in Paris (where it's doing just that in the photograph on our cover) and in the U.S., as of now. The fabric - soft, thick, weightless as a moth's wing, spun together out of mohair, nylon and wool by Ascher Ltd of London; used repeatedly, in the recent collections by Castillo of Lanvin, who designed the coat. Moth's wing colours, too: a huge blurry blotting of black on brown'. According to Mendes, 'the double-breasted front gave additional protection and the whole bulky, yet feather-light garment trapped a layer of insulating air around the body.",
