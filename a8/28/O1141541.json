His body is covered with a robe which is draped over both shoulders and falls in narrow pleats over his arms and knees. He is wearing a circular collar decorated with a pointed, star burst design. The Buddha has a rounded face with an aquiline nose and well defined arched eyebrows. The almond-shaped eyes are half-closed and a large circular urna is in the centre of his forehead. The wavy hair which forms the usnisa on top of his head is slightly chipped. The ears are elongated. A large plain halo surrounds his head and the top of his shoulders; there is a large chip at the centre of the topmost edge. The throne has pilasters on either side with square capitals decorated with an x-shaped pattern; the columns are defined with a flaring, leaf or petal-like design and the bases are round. A cushion decorated with a diagonal design appears above the drapery in between the pilasters which has pendant folds, gathered at the sides.",
