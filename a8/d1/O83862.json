This encapsulated lithographic print is little more than a sheet of text; a confession, briefly intimate and direct. The plastic coating creates a barrier between the viewer and the print, perhaps echoing the emotional distance McQueen determines with the words \"The pain of the break-up was so great I will never allow myself to experience it ever again\".\n\nThis print is included in a limited-edition box set of prints and photographs, published by SHOWstudio in 2001. The set consists of a range of works by a variety of people from the creative industries, from photographers to pop stars, and the works \u2013 a collection of art, artefacts and fashion ephemera \u2013 are exclusive to this set. The mix of media and creative practitioners involved in this portfolio reflects the interests of the SHOWstudio project, concerned with contemporary image-making, fashion and multimedia. It could be described as a time capsule or a modern archive.",
