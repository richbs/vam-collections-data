Only the unmarried and prostitutes wore their hair loose.  \n\nHair pins were worn throughout the country, but the most numerous and interesting come from the north.  They were usually worn at the back of the head, piercing and securing the thick braids of hair.  They were inserted diagonally or horizontally, so that the decorative heads stuck out at the side of the face.  The number of pins worn varied by district.  In some places they were worn all round the head, like a fan, but the largest were usually worn singly or in pairs.\n\nThe filigree head of this pin is typical of the region around Genoa, which was famous for its filigree work in the 19th century.  It has a gold mark which shows it was made in northwest Italy between 1824 and 1872.  It was bought for 12 shillings as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
