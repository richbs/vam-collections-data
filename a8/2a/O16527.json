            "physical_description": "Landseer was one of the most famous and successful painters of his century, specialising in the depiction of animals usually in a Scottish setting.  This early work - the artist was only nineteen years old - was painted before Landseer had visited Scotland, so he must have imagined the loch and mountain scenery.  Like the pictures by Brooks and Duncan (cat.nos. 74 and 77), the painting proposes more than the portraits of two (in Scottish dialect 'twa') dogs, a Newfoundland and a collie: it refers to Robert Burns' poem 'The Twa Dogs: a Tale', the heroes of which were Caesar and Luath.  In the poem, the dogs converse, not in a complimentary way, on the subject of men and their manners. In this sense, the painting is the earliest example of Landseer's anthropomorphic impulse, endowing animals with the emotions and intellects of humans.  This work also displays the artist's dazzling technique; an infant prodigy with pencil and brush, Landseer was compared later by critics to the finest old masters, in this case to the great Flemish animal painter Jan Fyt.",

Studied with BR Haydon, entered the RA Schools 1817 (at the age of 14); won annual prizes of the Royal Society of Arts 1813-17. A precocious and prodigious talent, as both painter and draughtsman, he exhibited - in a long and distinguished career - 179 works at the RA between 1815 and 1873, 94 at the BI 1818-65, and four at the SBA 1826-32. \nSubjects included portraits, but predominantly dealt with animal and human genre, often based in Scotland. Elected ARA 1826 (at the earliest permitted age), RA 1831. Received the patronage of the Russell family, and - most importantly- that of the Royal family, to whom he was Drawing Master, beginning in 1836 with the Duchess of Kent (Queen Victoria's mother); most significantly, he represented in visual form the Queen and Prince Albert's love for the life and landscape of the Scottish Highlands. Together with George IV's celebrated visit to Edinburgh 1822, and the great popularity of Sir Waiter Scott's Waverley novels, Landseer's contribution to the place of Scotland in European culture in the 19th century was considerable. The artist's own popularity was increased by the great number of reproductive prints after his works (Graves alone lists 434 by 126 engravers, see Lit below); his 'Monarch of the Glen' (exh, RA 1851), commissioned by the House of Lords but the cost refused by the House of Commons, was eventually bought by Sir Thomas Dewar and reproduced on his family firm's whisky bottle labels. Also significant was his anthropomorphic treatment of animals, particularly dogs; the <u>Art Journal</u> obituarist stressed that 'his dogs are not mere portraits only, they are thinking, almost rational, creatures, wanting only the gift of speech to hold converse with us'. Knighted 1850; offered PRA 1865, but refused, almost certainly because of his poor physical and mental health. Died London 1 October 1873; buried in St Paul's Cathedral. His studio sale was at Christie's 8-15 May 1874; a commemorative exhibition was held at the RA 1874/5. After the Royal Collection, the V&A possesses the largest holding of Landseer's works; there are a great many drawings and prints as well as the oils catalogued below, principally from the Sheepshanks Gift, one of the artist's most important patrons. \n\nLIT: F G Stephens <u>The Early Works of Sir Edwin Landseer RA</u> 1869; J Dafforne <u>Pictures by Sir Edwin Landseer </u>... 1873; <u>Art Journal </u>1873, p326 (obit); interleaved copy of 1874 RA exhibition catalogue, annotated by C S Mann, with photographs of prints after Landseer, 1874-7,4 vols (National Art Library, V&A); A Graves <u>Catalogue of the Works of the Late Sir Edwin Landseer</u> 1876; C Monkhouse entry in DNB; C Lennie Landseer: Victorian Paragon 1976; R Ormond <u>Sir Edwin Landseer</u> Philadelphia Museum of Art and Tate Gallery exhibition catalogue 1981 (With full bibliography).\n\n<b>The Twa Dogs</b> \nFA92 Neg M490 \nCanvas, 43.2 X 54 cm (17 X 21\u00bcins) \nSigned and dated 'EL/1822' br Sheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nThis early work, despite the Highland landscape of loch and mountain, predates the artist's first visit to Scotland in 1824 by two years. It depicts a Newfoundland and a collie dog, who represent Caesar and Luath, the subjects of Robert Burns's early poem 'The Twa Dogs: a Tale'. Luath was the poet's own dog. According to Graves's <u>Catalogue</u>, 'the large dog is Neptune, Mr. W. Ellis Gosling's dog'. Dafforne comments on the subject of both poet and painter: \nTwo dogs conversing about men and their manners ... the poem opens with a description of each, as they sit down to a discussion of their respective masters, and their masters' homes ... animals sitting in judgement on the 'lords o\u2019 the creation', and which the artist has represented with such truth and spirit. The debate, if so it may be called, has become lively; the head of each dog shows remarkable animation as they warm up in the discussion - one, as the rest of the poem shows, in no way complimentary to those who are the subjects of this canine debate, but who are not 'in court' to justify themselves either in person or by counsel. \n\nThe work thus provides an early example of the artist's anthropomorphic subject matter; the overtly satirical quality of Burns's poem, however, is lacking. \nWaagen thought it 'carried out masterly truth, recalling Fyt [the 17th century Antwerp painter Jan Fyt] in the sunny effect'. The text accompanying the 1870 engraving in the <u>Art Journal</u> noted 'though a comparatively youthful performance, it shows not a few of the youthful qualities which in after years have given the artist distinction; the dogs are animated and full of character; and the landscape ... exhibits with fidelity the scenery of the country'. \nAnother work bore the same title and was exhibited at the BI in 1858 (28); this is described by the <u>Art Journal</u> (1858, p77): 'in this picture we have only the heads - one of a well-conditioned Newfoundland and the other is that of a collie' (see also the Examiner 1858, p101). A painting titled 'The Two Dogs' was exhibited at the RA in 1839, but the Art Union (1839, p2l) indicates it showed a different composition. \nMann states that a version was originally bought for \u00a3300 was later sold for \u00a32415. \n\nENGR: BP Gibbon 1827; Charles G.
