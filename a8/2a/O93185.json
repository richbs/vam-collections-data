His wife, Lady Smithers, thinks that he bought them from Saks Fifth Avenue in New York. They are in excellent condition because Sir Peter did not wear them very much as he began wearing elastic-topped socks.\n\nSock suspenders were worn to prevent socks from slipping down. They were introduced in about 1895 in the form of an elastic band around the calf with a pendant pieced clipped on to the top of the sock. The design was clearly adapted from women\u2019s suspenders and for some years the wearing of sock suspenders was considered effeminate. This pair were made in the 1940s, when socks came up to the mid calf and needed to be supported.",
