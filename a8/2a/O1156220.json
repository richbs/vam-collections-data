The idea is most central to their work and their name translates to 'the last shout', describing the latest fashion. The chair is manufactured by Magis, an Italian business which gives a novel twist to domestic design, building its identity on incorporating leading edge technology into mass production. \n\nThe object was acquired for the 2010 exhibition 'Sit Down: Seating for Kids', for the section, 'What is a seat?', as it is an object not obvious in its function. It is also an example of how modern design encourages creativity and play.",
