            "public_access_description": "This caricature of William Mollison is from the fourth album that the commercial artist George Cooke used for his caricatures of music hall and variety performers. It contains caricatures drawn from 1910 to 1919. Originally from Yorkshire, George Cooke specialised in designing illustrated publicity material for performers. These included flyers, letterheads, posters and newspaper advertisements. He was based at the Grand Theatre for several years. The theatre was designed by Frank Matcham and opened in 1894. Cooke later moved to Blackpool, where he drew performers at the Palace Theatre.\n\nBy 1917 Cooke appears to have moved to London, where he established Cooke\u2019s Publicity Agency at 453 The Strand. We know that he had considered a move to London for some time, since in May 1906, when he was still in Hanley, a note from him was printed in the variety artistes\u2019 magazine The Performer. It read:\n\nPhil Ray says my work\u2019s too good for Hanley; I ought to be in London. But I want money to start with. Who\u2019ll give me some! Griff can\u2019t afford now he\u2019s two families to keep. But he wishes me luck. Many thanks, old friend. GEORGE COOKE, Caricaturist, Hanley.\n\nPhil Ray and Griff were both performers whose caricatures feature in Cooke\u2019s albums.",

            "history_note": "Wilkie Bard , actor and music hall performer, was known as the 'costers' laureate' because of his songs in cockney dialect on London common life. An actor from 1877, he made his music-hall debut in 1891 at the London Pavillion, where he was an immediate hit, singing such songs as 'The Coster's Serenade' and 'It's the Nasty Way 'E Sez It.' Some of his songs had tongue-twisting choruses that lent themselves to pantomime as well as music hall. Among his famous songs were 'She sells sea Shells', 'The Leith Police Dismisseth us' and his famous Opera Sketch 'I want to Sing in Opera'.  He incorporated his hit song 'She Sells Sea Shells' into <i>Dick Whittington</i> in Drury Lane in 1908. The verse and chorus went:\n\nI\u2019ve just had a letter to say I\u2019m engaged\nTo appear in the pantomime:\nThe part I\u2019ve to play is the Principal Boy,\nSo I\u2019m in for a beautiful time.\nThe panto\u2019s Dick Whittington- I\u2019m dirty Dick,\nThe fellow who once rode to York.\nThe manager says I must get a good song\nAbout which the public will talk.\nI\u2019ve commissioned some authors to write me a song:\nA very fine chorus they\u2019ve sent me along!\n\n She sells sea shells on the sea shore,\nThe shells she sells are sea shells, I\u2019m sure,\nFor if she sells sea shells on the sea shore,\nThen I\u2019m sure she sells sea-shore shells!\n\nIn 1909 Wilkie Bard appeared as Widow Twankey in the Drury Lane pantomime and continued continued to appear on the stage until he retired, shortly before his death in 1944 aged seventy.",
