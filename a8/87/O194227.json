In 1832 he and Lucas embarked on the production of five large mezzotints, of which The Cornfield is the second. The production of t his was first discussed in June 1832 but not completed until a year later. The corresponding oil painting in the National Gallery is one of Constable's most famous works.",

In sending him the picture (1832) Constable writes to Lucas: \n\"I send you the picture with my best hopes and wishes, and which I assure you are not slight or disinterested; but I am more anxious for your sake than my own that your enthusiasm may not be thrown away, nor prove unpropitious.\"",
