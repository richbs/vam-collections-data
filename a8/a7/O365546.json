The idea that the Museum should commission a tapestry - ultimately for its permanent collection but with the immediate purpose of creating a loan travelling exhibit - was first mooted in 1963; but it was not until the autumn of 1966 that a commission was awarded to the painter Harold \tCohen to design it, and supervise its execution by the Edinburgh Tapestry Company. In 1965 Cohen had designed a very large tapestry (26 feet long, nearly 9 feet high) for the London headquarters offices of British Petroleum. This had in fact been his first experience of the medium. But in the course of twelve months which it took to complete he had established a particularly happy relationship with the weavers of the Edinburgh Company, and was thoroughly versed in the general technical problems of a large tapestry.\n\nHe determined, nevertheless, that the new work should be quite different in character from the first, and his starting move was to test out at an experimental scale how certain design ideas could satisfactorily be translated into woven wool. Here are two examples of experiments which the artist did not find satisfactory. The first was concerned with colour transitions within a strictly mechanical weaving pattern, and passages of the final tapestry did in fact develop some use of this idea. The second weave was intended to try out the possibility of a very deep coarse texture of weave gradually changing to smooth texture and flat colour; but was not taken up."
