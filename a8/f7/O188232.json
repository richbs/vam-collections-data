            "public_access_description": "This stoneware ale mug was made in Bristol by the potter John Harwell who obligingly signed it on the base.  It is also dated 1739 and inscribed with the name of Edward Southwell, the successful candidate in the Bristol bye-election of 1739.\n\nIn 1739 John Harwell was still an apprentice potter.  His master was Joseph Taylor, and it is likely they both worked at the Redcliff Pottery of Thomas Frank in Bristol.  Harwell successfully completed his apprenticeship and became free in 1740, and this mug was probably made to demonstrate his exceptional potting abilities.  Hunting subjects were traditionally used to decorate tavern or ale mugs, and by first dipping the mug in a slip glaze, Harwell has applied a wonderful range of individually moulded elements called 'sprigs' including hawks, trees with birds, a sun, dogs etc..\n\nSigned mugs by Harwell date from 1738-66.  During the 1760s he was also recorded as a dealer in Staffordshire pottery.  He is thought to have died in 1772 or 1774.\n\nInformation taken from published works by Robin Hildyard.",

(private collection) The earliest recorded signed mug by John Harwell is dated 1738 (no. 192 in the exhibition catalogue).  Harwell was apprenticed to Joseph Taylor in 1733 and free in 1740.  Both are thought to have been working at Thomas Frank's Redcliff Pottery at the time.  Later in the 1760s John Wedgwood supplied him with earthen wares in 1761, 1767 and 1768 at an address in Rackhy Street, probably a 'Staffordshire Warehouse'.  He died c. 1772-4.  \nCat. no. 193 (this mug) Edward Southwell was the successful candidate in the 1739 Bristol bye-election.  Delftware bowls with the same inscription may also be Harwell pieces, as he was a <i>gallypotmaker</i>.  The recipients of this mug have not been identified.  Note that Harwell became free in 1740:  this might be an apprentice piece, made to demonstrate his exceptional skill.'\nFurther mugs signed or associated with Harwell or his son are nos. 194-196.",
