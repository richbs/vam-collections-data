Dancer\u2019s microphotographs (also referred to as micrographs or photomicrographs) were capable of magnification up to 20 times before any clarity was lost, and were primarily used to take photographs of microscopic objects. However, by 1859 he was producing slides of much larger objects, including portraits and pages from books. \n\nThis glass slide is a microphotograph of the \u2018Apostles Creed\u2019 by an unknown artist.\n\nThe Apostles Creed is an early statement of Christian belief, originally written in Latin. The English translation varies between different Christian denominations, but is commonly translated as:\n\nI believe in God, the Father Almighty, \n    the Creator of heaven and earth, \n    and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord: \nWho was conceived of the Holy Spirit,\n    born of the Virgin Mary,\n    suffered under Pontius Pilate,\n    was crucified, died, and was buried.\nHe descended into hell.\nThe third day He arose again from the dead.\nHe ascended into heaven\n    and sits at the right hand of God the Father Almighty,\n    whence He shall come to judge the living and the dead.\nI believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church,\n    the communion of saints,\n    the forgiveness of sins,\n    the resurrection of the body,\n    and life everlasting.\nAmen.",
