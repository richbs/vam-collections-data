            "public_access_description": "This sugar bowl is a duplicate of part of a 116-piece dessert service shown by Minton at the Great Exhibition of 1851. The replica was specially made for the Museum of Manufactures at Marlborough House. It was acquired because of its 'successful turquoise colour' and as an example of 'the highest state of English ceramic manufacture'. Queen Victoria had been so struck by the appearance of the original service when she attended the preview of the Great Exhibition that she purchased it. After the close of the Exhibition she presented it to the Emperor of Austria. It can now be seen in the Hofsilber -und Tafelkammer at the Hofburg in Vienna.\n\nThe combination of glazed and decorated bone china with unglazed Parian figures was praised by the Great Exhibition jury for its 'original design, high degree of beauty and harmony of effect', though some objected to it. John Tallis, in his History and Description of the Crystal Palace (1852) also praises the 'bleu celeste' (turquoise colour) as being 'scarcely inferior to that of old S\u00e8vres', which it was largely emulating.\n\nThe parian figures on this sugar bowl are the work of the designer and figure-modeller, Pierre-Emile Jeannest (1813-1857) who was the son of a French bronzier and pupil of Delaroche. He worked for Minton for several years between about 1848 and 1854. The painting was probably executed by Thomas Kirkby (1824-1890) who was a leading Minton painter and designer who spent over 50 years with the factory.",
