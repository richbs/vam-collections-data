London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, p. 45, cat. no. 45\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"Sebastien BOURDON (1616-71) \n<i>French School</i> \nBorn in Montpellier, he was a pupil of Barth\u00e9lemy in Paris and subsequently came under the lasting influence of Claude Poussin in Rome. In 1637 he settled in Paris, where he became a founder member and Rector of the Acad\u00e9mie Royale in 1648. While Court painter to Queen Christina of Sweden (1652-54) he painted mainly portraits, but after his return to Paris he was engaged principally on religious subjects. \n\n\nAfter Sebastien BOURDON (?) \n\n45 \nSELF PORTRAIT \n<i>Canvas mounted on panel</i> \n11 7/8 x 9 1/8 (30 x 23) \nDyce Bequest \nD.43\n \nAn 18th century copy, probably of the portrait in the St\u00e4delsches Kunstinstitut, Frankfurt (no. 556). There are etchings of this portrait by J. P. Schweyer (1754-1813) and J. F. Morgenstern (dated 1804), but, as these show the portrait reversed, D. 43 was presumably copied from the painting and not from one of the etchings. The Frankfurt portrait, which is identical, was formerly attributed to J. H. Roos (1631-85), but this has been rejected in favour of a Netherlandish or French attribution (Jedding, 1955, p. 281). The name of V. Vallerand has been suggested, but this is not accepted by the St\u00e4delsches Kunstinstitut (information supplied by Dr E. Holzinger). Another version with minor variations, is in the Mus\u00e9e Cond\u00e9, Chantilly. This has always been called Sebastien Bourdon: another attribution subject to considerable reservation (Chantilly, Mus\u00e9e Cond\u00e9, <i>Peintures de l'\u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise xve-xviie si\u00e8cle</i>, no. 92 as 'attributed to Bourdon'). \n\n<i>Prov.</i> The Rev.
