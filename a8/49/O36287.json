It is the stylized form of the horses and sleigh mounted on a flat base which in turn is on four wheels held to a static axle by nails. The horses are not painted but are decorated with lines of purple dots to show the bridles and manes; the yokes are stained turquoise. The tails are lengths of black felt glued on. The centre horse has the shafts (stained turquoise) and a harness (stained pink) nailed on to its body. The sleigh is stained yellow and decorated with turquoise pink and black around the top edge and on the side and bottom to show a floral design. Glued to the seat is a figure; very crude and stylized; stained yellow with turquoise on the arms and pink on the hands and hat. The facial features have been painted in black. From the figure's hands to the mouth of the centre horse is a length of black thread; representing the reins. The base is stained yellow and the wheels pink. All the parts are nailed on. \nThis toy was made to traditional designs and it would have been sold to the Co-operative group for sale. Although the area co-operatives have been replaced there is still no credit given to an actual maker.",
