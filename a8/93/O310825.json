There is not a lot known about his life although he was celebrated as Saint in East and West. He is one of the most popular Saints. The legends told about him, were not spread before 500 years after his death. His parents having died when he was very young, he was consequently brought up by his uncle. He inherited a lot of money from his parents, which he all gave away to the needy and entered a monastery. The legend says that he gave three bags of gold to three girls for their marriage dowries, so as to prevent them from prostitution. He died when only ca. 46 years old. Myra and its shrine were taken by the Moslems and the relics transferred to Bari in 1087, where they are now.",
