Plates (12) comprising a set published by C. J. Visscher (series letter C).  (See Berlin II, no.237a.1 ; Holl.D.13-24) \nE.889 <i>lettered</i> Adriaen Munting F.  CJVisscher excud <i>and with the publisher's series letter.  The remainder lettered with monogram</i> AM.  <i>Numbered consecutively</i> 1 <i>to</i>12 (2 <i>to</i> 8 <i>numbered twice</i>). \n<i>Engravings.  Average size of plates</i> 5.1 x 9.5 cm. \nE.889-900-1963 \n \n<i>Note:</i> Ten plates from a similar set varying slightly in size are in the Department of Prints and Drawings, E.2613-2622-1910, and appear to be copies from the present set; they are unsigned and some subjects have scrolls added at the sides without modification to the original composition.  Of the 5 plates listed in Berlin, only the first is regarded as the original and this appears to correspond with Pl.9 of the present set.  Hollstein lists a set of 12 each signed and dated 'AM 97' and Nos. 2 and 3 of the Berlin set appear to be impression from a plate from this set.  It can be assumed then that the present set was published before 1597 and is probably the original. \"\n<u>Berlin Staatliche Museen: Katalog der Ornamentstich-Sammlung</u>.

Of the 5 plates listed in Berlin, only the first is regarded as the original and this appears to correspond with Pl.9 of the present set.  Hollstein lists a set of 12 each signed and dated \u2018AM 97\u2019 and Nos. 2 and 3 of the Berlin set appear to be impression from a plate from this set.  It can be assumed then that the present set was published before 1597 and is probably the original.",
