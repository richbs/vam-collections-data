However, he was capable of seeing and recording poor behaviour by the ever-increasing hordes of British tourists. Here they are shown galloping on their donkeys, oblivious of the Obelisk of Senusert at Al-Matariyyah (Heliopolis). What makes this worse is that the Egyptian hoteliers specifically requested that the often beefy visitors should not `gallop the donkeys\u2019 who were not designed for it. Alas, the thrill of racing has consumed the thoughtless riders, as they rush past the antiquities they had ostensibly come to see. \n\nSimpson was a lithographer and prolific watercolour painter, who eventually became what would now be called a war-correspondent. He was sent by Colnaghi's, the print publishers, to cover the Crimean War, 1854-5, providing drawings for lithographs published in The Seat of War in the East, 1855-6. From 1866 he was employed by the Illustrated London News as their `Special Artist' to report on and illustrate many of the wars and grand ceremonial occasions of the British Empire and elsewhere. Simpson\u2019s vigorous sketches were swiftly transformed into wood-engravings, giving the ever expanding pool of news-hungry readers the illustrations they craved. He lived long enough to see photography start to replace his form of reportage in magazines.",
