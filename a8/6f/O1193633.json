The viewer used Super 8 film and the actual clips were short pieces from real cartoon films. No technology was required to operate the viewer, not even batteries. The hand crank enabled the operator to view the film at any speed with the ability to go forwards or backwards at will. This particular example was a favourite toy of the donor who played with it during the 1970s.\n\nThis particular viewer was a much loved birthday present, the result of persistent pestering on the part of the donor when she was about ten years old.",
