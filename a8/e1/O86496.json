They were drawn and compiled by the commercial artist George Cooke. Cooke specialised in designing artwork for publicity material for music hall performers. This included leaflets, newspaper advertisements and posters. But these caricatures all seem to have been done purely for his own pleasure. This album covers the years from 1903 to 1905, when Cooke was based at the Grand Theatre of Varieties in Hanley. Most of his subjects were drawn when appearing there.\n\nThe Dame figure in a roundel is probably a caricature of Cooke himself. The performers below represent the comedian Edwin Boyde, right, and the mimic Leo Tell, left. They both appeared at the Grand Theatre during the week of 12 December 1904, and their caricatures appear in the first two volumes.",
