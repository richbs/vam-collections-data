They travelled around India making sketches and paintings of the scenery, and these were later turned into engravings for sale to the public.\n\nThe tree in this image is the Akshayabat, or immortal Banyan tree, which stands in the courtyard of the Vishnupad Temple in Gaya in northern India. Hindus believe they will reach heaven if their last rites are offered under this celebrated tree, and the Buddha is said to have meditated here for six years.\n\nThe banyan tree (Ficus bengalensis) can be found across India. It has wide-spreading tangled branches from which aerial roots hang. Some take root in the ground, eventually forming further tree trunks, which support the spreading branches. The oldest is thought to be in the Calcutta Botanic Garden. Planted some 200 years ago, it has spread to over 300 metres in diameter.",
