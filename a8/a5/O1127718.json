Female evening dress, including that for children, was always reflective of the prevailing fashions, but often with shorter sleeves and lower necklines, whereas the male equivalent conventionally came to consist of black dinner jacket and trousers with a white shirt and black or white bow tie. \n\nIn the early twentieth century the black dinner jacket and trousers was more associated with boys in their middle teens and older; for younger boys the Eton suit was often customary instead, although as late as 1939-40 the Army & Navy Stores catalogue lists evening dress for boys as young as twelve.  Girls of all ages between 1900 and the 1960s often wore white or pastel coloured dresses, usually more elaborately made or finished than their day ones.",
