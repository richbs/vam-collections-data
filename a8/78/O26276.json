The main title and the individual ones are in four languages: French, German, English and Polish. The aim is to reach immortality, and the end space of the game is the Immortal Man. It shows a memorial monument with an urn on the shoulders of women who stand on a column and steps, accompanied by four figures. On the memorial tablet are the words \u2018MLEOPOLD/HERvBRAUNS/GEB1752GEST85\u2019, which refer to Leopold of Brunswick, who drowned in 1785 while attempting to save people in a flood. He would have featured here as a model of selflessness, which was considered one of the qualities needed to attain eternal life.",
