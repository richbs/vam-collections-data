Saul is an old man looking to the past, while David is young and beautiful and faces into the future.\n\nPeter Snow was Head of Theatre Design at the Slade School of Fine Art, London University, between 1967-92. He had many solo exhibitions as an artist, but also created much set design for theatre, opera, ballet and television, notably designing the set for Peter Hall's first English production of Beckett's Waiting For Godot in 1955. His later designs, including this poster, were very much influenced by a study trip to Mexico in the 1960s, where he observed ancient rituals and masks. This led him towards the use of Aztec imagery in his painting, combined with the bright colours of the Mexican Day of the Dead festival.\n\nUniversity College Opera (or UCOpera) is the student opera company of University College London. Founded in 1951, it has become known for its performances of little known operas, including three world premi\u00e8res. The operas are staged and performed by professional singers, directors and designers, with the student body performing in the orchestra and chorus.",
