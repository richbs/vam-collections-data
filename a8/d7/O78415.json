They could be purchased as part of a large canteen of cutlery or in boxed sets.\n\nFood & Drink\nThe idea of a formal afternoon tea, taken by family and friends at about 4 o'clock, emerged as people began to dine later in the evening. In the mid-18th century fashionable society dined between 3 and 4 o'clock, but by the early 19th century 7 or 8 o'clock was the rule. Afternoon tea provided welcome refreshment and an added social engagement between lunch at 1 o'clock and the later dinner hour. Apart from tea, thin bread and butter, cake and fresh fruit would be offered. Tea could also be served at other afternoon events, such as the more elaborate 'at home' teas, which combined refreshment with entertainment, or at a later, more substantial 'high tea'.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe style of this spoon is derived from that of French examples from the Empire period (about 1800-1815). Similar designs were made in France in the 1860s and looked back to the 18th century for inspiration.\n\nManufacturer\nThe manufacturer of the teaspoon, Hunt & Roskell, was one of the most prestigious silversmiths of the Victorian period. The partnership lasted from 1843 to 1897 and exhibited at the major international exhibitions of the period.",
