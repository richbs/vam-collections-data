The sleeves were probably replaced/remade in the early 1830s as their volume and size is more typical of that period than the early 1820s. As she was a draper's wife, she would have been able to match the plain white lawn fabric.\n\nResearch has uncovered that she was Elizabeth Stephens, who married William Rowe (a draper, b. 1798), on 20 March 1827 at St. Agnes, Cornwall. They had three children - George, the donor of the dress (1 March 1829-1915), Amelia (1833-1835) and Thomas Stephens Rowe (1835-1908). William remarried in 1841, so Elizabeth must have died between 1835 and 1841.",
