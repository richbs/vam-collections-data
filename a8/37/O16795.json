She swiftly moved into wholesale production with her Ginger Group garments, which had an easy fitting, informal styling. This is an excellent example of a Ginger Group mini-dress. A similar jersey dress was illustrated in Honey (March 1967) and cost 8 1/2 guineas. This and similar dresses in the collection would have been worn with dense black or white tights (Mary Quant designed her first tights in 1965), and big-brimmed felt hats or berets in matching Ginger Group colours. \n\nThis dress forms part of the Cecil Beaton Collection, brought together by the society photographer Sir Cecil Beaton (1904-1980). With great energy and determination, Beaton contacted the well-dressed elite of Europe and North America to help create this lasting monument to the art of dress. The Collection was exhibited in 1971, accompanied by a catalogue that detailed its enormous range.",
