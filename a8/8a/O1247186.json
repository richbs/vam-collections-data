The cuttings were preserved, and presumably taken, by Mrs Caroline Augusta Gammack (1852-1916) who worked as a stock keeper for Mrs Stratton. \n\nThe Princess's wedding dress, to which these items are related, was described in many publications. <i>The Graphic</i>, 'The Princess Beatrice's Trousseau', 27 July 1885, described the dress as having a 'foundation, of the richest ivory-tinted satin duchesse; the train, which was cut in the skirt itself, and had a very graceful effect; on the <i>tablier </i>was a very novel garniture of orange-blossom and buds with their pale delicate foliage. The magnificent Honiton lace with which the bridal dress was trimmed was designed and made for the Queen's wedding dress, and together with the veil was lent for the present occasion by Her Majesty.'",
