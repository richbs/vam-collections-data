In the 1780s he made a series of landscapes, in oil on glass, to be viewed in this specially constructed 'showbox'.  Gainsborough was probably inspired by the example of contemporary glass paintings and the 'Eidophusikon', a miniature theatre for the display of pictures invented by the painter Philippe-Jacques de Loutherbourg in 1781.  He used these transparencies, whose subjects were mainly drawn from the landscape near his native Sudbury, as an aid for planning larger compositions and for exploring different effects of lighting.\n\nA contemporary witness described the working of the showbox thus: 'The machine consists of a number of glass planes, which are moveable, and were painted by himself [Gainsborough], of various subjects, chiefly landscapes.  They are lighted by candles at the back, and are viewered through a magnifying lens, by which means the effect produced is truly captivating, especially the moonlight pieces, which exhibit the most perfect resemblance of nature.'",
