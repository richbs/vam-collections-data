Mrs Borkman, in Ibsen's John Gabriel Borkman, is a dour, inflexible woman, who does not reveal her emotions, and in his drawing for her costume, Leslie Hurry reflects this in the austerity of her dress, tight fitting, almost without decoration; the colouring subtly hints at a shot silk, a fabric woven of two colours which flow into each other, giving an ever-moving effect - which also hints at aspects of her character.  \nAlthough theatre designs are often considered works of art and are sought after by museums and private collectors, their artistic worth or decorative qualities are secondary to whether they 'work' on stage.  The success of a costume design cannot be judged until it is translated into fabric, texture and decoration by the costume makers and seen as part of the whole stage picture.  Some designers are very knowledgeable about costume making and produce very detailed designs, with notes on fabrics and making techniques, others create an 'atmospheric' drawing, which gives the feeling of the costume, and they then either work closely with the costume maker to realise their concept or have trusted makers who know their work and can create the effects they have in mind.",
