This example is typical of the polychrome tin-glazed earthenware chargers made in London at this period.\n\nTime\nAfter the final defeat of the Royalists at the battle of Worcester in 1651, the young King, Charles II, fled to France and  Oliver Cromwell ruled for the nine years of the Commonwealth. For most of the population, who remained more or less untouched by recent events, life continued as usual, but it was a joyless period. Cromwell banned the celebration of Christmas, there were wars with the Dutch and uncertainty about Cromwell's successor. \n\nIn this atmosphere, it is not so surprising that this delftware dish should have a date but not the initials of the man or couple who commissioned it. Although the limited range of oxide colours is inevitably bright, the serious subject suggests Puritan influence and personal initials may have been condemned as personal ostentation.",
