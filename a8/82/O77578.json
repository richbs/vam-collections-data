However, recent examination has suggested that it was made in the 19th century, probably shortly before it was bought by a collector of antique furniture some time between 1860 and 1880. It was intended to look like a 17th-century child's chair. This is a good example of a piece of furniture made to deceive collectors of antiques.\n\nOwnership\nThe Museum bought the chair and other objects from the sale of the collection of the Reverend William Maskell (about 1814-1890) in 1890, after his death. Previously Mr Maskell had lent the chair, with another, to the Museum for display. The Museum also has other objects bought from Mr Maskell during his lifetime.\n\nDesign & designing\nWhen examined closely, the proportions of the chair appear unusual: neither low enough for a child, nor high enough for a high chair. The carving in the back looks like it dates from the 19th century, particularly the straight vertical acanthus leaves running up the either side of the chair-back. Signs of distressing (intentional damage to make the chair look old) can be seen on some of the inner surfaces. The profile of the turning of the front legs suggests that the chair dates from the 1860s.",
