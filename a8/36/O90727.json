At each side of the head of the cradle is a shallow lobed wing of wood, and along the outer top edge of each side are three wooden pegs (for use in lacing the top of the cradle to keep the baby securely within).  The cradle has a hollow base with two lengthwise batons, mounted on two transverse rockers with a central stretcher between them.",

They were mostly from Germany and German-speaking areas: \u2018Dutch\u2019 in this case derives from \u2018Deutsch\u2019, the German word for German. They developed distinctive arts and crafts forms based on elements of the native culture that they had brought with them.\n\nThis panelled cradle is rectangular with inward-sloping sides, a traditional form in Germanic culture. The maker of the cradle has decorated it at the head and foot with voided heart motifs. The heart is a recurrent symbol in Pennsylvanian Dutch art, where it links to a person\u2019s religious beliefs and symbolises the individual. These particular heart motifs may also have had a practical application: the easiest way to move the cradle is by fitting two fingers of each hand into the curves of the hearts before lifting it. Along the outer top edge of each side are three wooden pegs for use in lacing the top of the cradle to keep the baby securely within.",
