            "public_access_description": "Born in Ghana in 1956, Joe Casely-Hayford's family immigrated to London when he was a child. In the early 1970s he worked as a tailor's apprentice on Savile Row and studied fine tailoring at the Tailor & Cutter Academy. From the late 1970s he designed for the music industry, making performance clothes for rock groups. In 1984 Joe Casely-Hayford launched his menswear label, with womenswear following in 1986. His signature look combines sharp tailoring and a high level of technical skill with features drawn from streetstyle and club culture. In 1992, he was commissioned by the Liberty department store to design a dress for their exhibition of contemporary British wedding fashion.\n\nAlternative dress is deliberately anti-fashion, and bridal wear does not necessarily follow day-to-day fashion trends. The designer explores this unexpected relationship by combining alternative design elements with traditional white-wedding style. During the wedding ceremony, the bride stands with her back to her guests. Wedding dresses often feature attractive back detailing for this reason. Joe Casely-Hayford has decorated the back of his white silk dress with a metal-studded pierced heart motif, more suited to a biker\u2019s leather jacket. The slogan, \u201cFarewell Sweet Liberty\u201d, is simultaneously humorous and poignant. Whilst the fabric is traditional, the frayed edges, studs, and chains were inspired by Punk and alternative clothing.",
