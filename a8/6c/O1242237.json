Olympic Stadium with Cranes II is one of series of prints she has produced since 2009 which have taken as their subject the area of Hackney where the Olympic park is being built, and the architecture of the Olympic stadium in progress.  The circular stadium seen from above has some striking similarities with her collage prints Whirlpool (also in the V&A), but also references earlier models such as Piranesi.",
