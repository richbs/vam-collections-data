The slop bowl was sold as a standard item in a tea service of the period. This bowl is part of a relatively expensive service made of Minton's very high-quality bone china and is skilfully painted.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThis painting of a bunch of fresh country flowers such as honeysuckle and grasses is in an apparently innocently naturalistic manner but in fact owes much to an awareness of Japanese art.  Although the painting of flowers and insects was highly fashionable in Britain in the 18th century, it became popular again with the influx of Japanese art and artefacts from the mid-1860s onwards.  British artists and designers were encouraged to invent new versions of natural, asymmetrical and informal decoration, often using insects and wild flowers.  The cups in this service have handles in the form of butterflies.\n\nSocial Class\nTablewares were an essential part of Minton's production throughout the 19th century and contributed significantly to the company's stability.  Ironstones, semi-porcelains, bone chinas and earthenwares were produced in vast quantities, reflecting the various styles in current use in the factory. Minton's bone china was recognised to be of exquisite quality, and in the later 19th century the company established its reputation as a supplier of special services to the royal and aristocratic families of Europe. This quality  was maintained throughout the bone china production, even if, as here, the decoration was rather less extravagant or the gilding less rich.",
