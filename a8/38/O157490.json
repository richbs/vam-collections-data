A threaded silver socket at the end of the head joint contains a removable silver cap containing a cut crystal jewel. At the other end of the head is attached a protecting silver lug which engages in a corresponding bar at the top of the next joint. On the main joints, five flat round silver keys are mounted on barrels turning on axels screwed into pillars soldered to base-plates cemented to the body of the instrument. There are two alternative foot joints, one with three keys, descending to C, the other with one key descending to D. Each of these foot joint keys terminates in a round plate, the underside of which carries a small axel-and-pillar mounting for the leather padded key-plate below, allowing this a rocking movement intended to ensure perfect covering of the hole when the key is closed.\" Anthony Baines, <i>Catalogue of Musical Instruments in the Victoria and Albert Museum - Part II: Non-keyboard instruments</i> (London, 1998), pp. 92 - 93.",
