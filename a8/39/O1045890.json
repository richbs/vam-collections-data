[D.&W. Murphy, The Tipperary Gu~de, Dubl~n c.1986, 33.] It appears that the head of the man on the right--probably the stationmaster, to judge by his uniform--moved between exposure of the left and right images. This movement suggests that the photograph was taken with a single-lens stereoscopic camera, in which the lens was moved manually from one side to the other between exposures. [See William C. Darrah, The World of Stereographs, Gettysburg, PA 1977, 3.] There are few such-Photographs by Lady Hawarden in this collection, indicating that she preferred to work with twin-lens stereoscopic cameras.'",
