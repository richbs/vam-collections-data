S., p. 111; Davies, p. 35).  A drawing dated 11 September 1820 of Whitley, near Solihull, was in Captain Charles Constable\u2019s collection.\nThis drawing bears no signs of having been in sketch-book; it was, however, mounted on card, and may have been trimmed.\n\nNote on Nos. 191, 192, 200, 203, 204, 206, 220, 238, and 239 [297-1888, 257-1888, 622-1888, 251-1888, 351-1888, 271-1888, 353-1888, 609-1888, 799-1888]\n\nNos. 191 [297-1888], 192 [257-1888], 220 [353-1888], and 239 [799-1888] are untrimmed leaves from a sketch-book, of which the pages measure 6 3/8 x 9 \u00be ins. (161 x 237 mm.) and some bear the Whatman watermark of 1818.  The dimensions of Nos. 200 [622-1888], 203 [251-1888], 204 [351-1888], 206 [271-1888], and 238 [609-1888], all of which have been mounted on card and probably trimmed, show that they most certainly come from the same sketch-book.  The dated leaves show that Constable used this sketch-book in 1820 (Nos. 191 [297-1888], 203 [251-1888], and 206 [271-1888]) and in 1821 (Nos. 220 [353-1888] and 238 [609-1888]).",
