It is one of the examples that were found in Sumatra, where they were probably usually used as canopies and backdrops for ceremonial occasions rather than as clothing.\n\nThe complete cloth has a lozenge-shaped centre field with a grid- or patchwork-like pattern that contrasts with the more flowering character of the surround. Indian textile workers used a variety of techniques to create the design. Mordant-dyeing involves the use of a metallic salt to create a permanent dye from natural dyes. With the resist-dyeing technique, the pattern is created by preventing certain parts of the cloth from absorbing the dye.",
