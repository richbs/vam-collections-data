            "public_access_description": "Design for the jewelled hilt of a smallsword, about 1745, attributed to the goldsmith Pasquier-Remi Mondon (about 1712-after 1784).   The designs are from an album of designs that date from about 1735-1820 and includes those for smallswords, snuffboxes, scent holders, watches and watch cases, spoons, fans and fan mounts, and chatelaines (ornamental chains, pins, or clasps usually worn at a woman's waist, to which trinkets, keys, purses, or other articles are attached).   The design was possibly for a elite client of the Court of Louis XV, King of France, from 1715 to 1774, at Versailles, Paris. Aristocratic men wore light swords, usually of the smallsword type as part of court dress at this period.\n\nThere is a close relationship between the contents of the album and known work by three Parisian goldsmiths, Jean Ducrollay (1710-1787), Pierre- Fran\u00e7ois Drais (active 1761-1788), and Charles Ouizille (1744-1830) whose names appear on the first page of the album. This suggests that all the designs emanate from their workshops.  Drais worked for the Court at Versailles as jeweller to both King Louis XV and Louis XVI. Ouizille worked in this capacity for Louis XVI. Most of the material dates from the period 1755-90.",
