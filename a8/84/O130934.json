Now little known, Skidmore was once famous as the maker of the Albert Memorial (1863-1876) and the Hereford Screen (which was exhibited in London at the International Exhibition of 1862).  Sir George Gilbert Scott (1811-1878) designed both the memorial and the screen and employed Skidmore to execute them. This is a photograph of the plaster models prior to electroplating them in copper after which they were mounted onto the Hereford Screen. The screen was made for the division between chancel and nave in Hereford Cathedral as part of Scott's renovation where it remained until it was dismantled in 1967. The figures can be seen on the Hereford Screen which was conserved and reassembled in the Ironwork Gallery of the V&A. \n\nBased in Coventry, Skidmore's firm worked for some of the leading designers of the Gothic Revival movement. Skidmore's career peaked in the 1860s when his factory employed over 100 staff but due to ill health and he died in relative poverty.",
