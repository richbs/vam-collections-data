Disillusioned with the stance of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS) the Pankhursts instead founded a more militant party, believeing in 'Deeds not words'. Members of the WSPU, known as 'Suffragettes', were encouraged to dress in purple, green and white, the colours of the Union. Mrs. Pethick-Lawrence, co-editor of the weekly newspaper 'Votes for Women', explained the symbolism of the colours. Purple as everyone knows is the royal colour. It stands for the royal blood that flows in the viens of every suffragette, the instinct of freedom and dignity...white stands for purity in private and public life...green is the colour of hope and the emblem of spring.' Sylvia Pankhurst was a gifted artist and used the colours to design banners and also memorablilia. She is credited as the designer of the insignia used on this teaset.",
