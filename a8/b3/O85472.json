Technical improvements in the casting of both base and precious metal candlesticks also substantially altered their form.\n\nThis brass example from about 1700 is one of a pair made in Italy. It has a triangular base and moulded socket. In the mid 1760s, when neo-classicism was popular, the characteristic shape for candlesticks was a straight or tapering column on a raised square or oval base. Later, beaded, engraved and relief ornament was added, and neo-classical types probably continued to be made in brass long after they had ceased to be popular in silver. Production of these candlesticks was further simplified by the development of casting the stem in one piece using a removable core, a process called hollow core casting. This allowed for a much finer and thinner casting to be made for both the base and the stem.",
