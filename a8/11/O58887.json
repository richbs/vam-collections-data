The back is veneered with ebony inlaid with ivory grotesques and other ornaments, and the  fingerboard with mother-of-pearl plaques depicting the Four Elements (Earth, Water, Fire and Air). Boxwood frets were crudely inserted at a later date. This guitar was made in 1627 by Giorgio Sellas (active 1620 - 1643), the brother of Matteo (active 1612-1641) and a member of an important family of luthiers of German origins who lived in Venice.",
