Attended the Academy of Music in Hanover Square from about 1843 to 1846, when he studied painting with his elder brother George (1822-1909). In 1854 settled in Cranbrook, Kent, with Thomas Webster (to whom he was related) and others; they came to be known as the Cranbrook Colony, specialising in rural genre painting. Exhibited 93 works at the RA between 1851 and 1898, and five at the BI 1851-56, all scenes of cottage life, sometimes humorous. His pictures of children engaged in adult pursuits were especially popular. Died Cranbrook 1 April 1911.\n \nLIT:  <i>Art Journal</i> 1875, pp73-6; A Greg <i>The Cranbrook Colony</i> exhibition catalogue Wolverhampton Art Gallery 1977 \n\n<b>Sunday Afternoon</b> \nF16 Neg 73781 \nPanel, 19 x 29.8 cm (7\u00bd x 11\u00be ins) \nSigned and dated 'F D H/1852' on wall to r of mantelpiece \nForster Bequest 1876 \n\nPresumably the painting commissioned by John Forster from the artist in July 1852 (see F15, above, letter no 4); Hardy wrote 'it shall be as you desire, a cottage interior with a figure', which describes this painting. \n\nIt is possible that this work was exhibited at the RA in 1853 (see F15, above, letter no 5); if so, it could have been 'The Day of Rest' (1059). \n\nLike the previous work, F15, it was painted in the neighbourhood of Snell's Wood, near Chenies, Buckinghamshire. \n\nEXH: ?RA 1853 (1059, 'The Day of Rest')\"",
