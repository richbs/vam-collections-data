This study demonstrates his handling of line with attuned observational skills and clarity with a hint of humour. This image is quite similar in its composition, handling and subject matter to <i>Conversation</i> (see Fuchs, E,<i> Der Maler Daumier</i>, 1927 p. 210, illus.) but also in its kindly temperament to <i>Deux Hommes</i> (Maison 146).\n\nAlthough best known for his satirical lithographs, Daumier was finally constrained to aim his satire at Bourgeois society due to the intermittent censorship of the press, imposed by the King.  During these periods of censorship and especially after the 1860s, he turned increasingly towards the depiction of people engaged in everyday activities.  This move towards more Realism may well have been influenced by his close friendship with the painter Corot and his association with The Barbizon School.\n\nDaumier's capability of working in different styles lent well to his skill as a caricaturist, but also provided the facility to draw everyday life with humility.  Because of his diverse and variable drawing techniques it is difficult to accurately date many of his drawings. To judge from the subject matter, it is not unlikely that this sketch belongs to the late career of the artist in the early 1870s.",
