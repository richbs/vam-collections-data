            "public_access_description": "This mixed media assemblage by American artist Reginald Case is built up around an archive photograph of legendary jazz vocalist Billie Holiday (1915-1959) with the jazz tenor saxophonists Ben Webster (on the left in red) and Johnny Russell (on the right in blue) taken in the 1930s by an unknown photographer. It was made in 1991 using found materials from a variety of sources: metal and plastic parts from junk shops on Canal Street in New York selling surplus odds and ends from manufacturers; beads, sequins and trim from the artist's wife Bonnie (an artist and fashion designer); and even glitter and toys from the artist's children. \n\nTrained as a painter, Case turned to collage in the 1970s. In his first experiments he would project a collage composition onto canvas and paint from that but the possibilities of the collage medium in its own right eventually led him to abandon the painting stage of the process altogether, because as he has said, 'The collages opened up whole areas I hadn't thought of in terms of painting, or didn't think were possible such as appropriating materials other than the photographic image in my work - materials like Mylar, metallic paper, trims, buttons, beads, fringe, glass - literally anything and everything.'\n\nCase's work has always reflected his fascination with popular culture, from his earlier collages inspired by American folk art to the later mixed media assemblages of American 'icons' like Marilyn Monroe, Barbie and Madonna which he says, 'give expression to the fascination of my youth with movies, vaudeville, theatre, radio and popular magazines. I could never find a way to imagine those subjects as part of my artwork until I began to make collages.'",
