The ballet traces the events set in train when the sailor, William Targett, returns to his home village with Tulip, a negro girl he has married in a native ceremony; the prejudice they encounter leads to his death and Tulip sends their child away to be brought up in Africa. \nThe design came to the Museum as part of a gift from Maude Lloyd, who was a close friend and colleague of Andr\u00e9e Howard.\n\nHistorical significance: \"The Sailor's Return\" was an example of dance drama, rather than pure ballet, and the second time that Howard had turned to David Garnett's novels as a source, the first being for one of her finest works, \"Lady into Fox\".  The role of Tulip provided Sally Gilmour with one of her finest roles.  \nHoward was one of a very few choreographers who also designed their own ballets.",
