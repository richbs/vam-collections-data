The cape is made of two halves each of which has the same design although the colours of the motifs on each half are not the same. The main feature of the design is a tall tree with two lions at the foot. The rest of the space is filled with an arrangement of birds, animals and insects, including a large tiger and several spotted creatures. At the top is a man on horseback charging forward with a lance. At the bottom is a border of a wavy stem bearing leaves and flowers which has been stitched on. As the design is not complete, it seems probable that the robe was made from a larger piece of embroidery. The robe is bound at the top with a narrow strip cut from the same piece of embroidery. It has the remains of tapes for tying and is lined with cream silk.",
