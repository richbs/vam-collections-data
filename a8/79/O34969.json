NUNO designers are renowned for their ability to develop and apply the latest technology to textile design and manufacture.  However, much of their work is also based on traditional Japanese textile techniques and aesthetics, and it is this fusion of the traditional with the contemporary that makes NUNO fabrics so innovative. Shutter is from the Cityscape Series and is based on the roll-down bellowed steel shutters which are still a common sight on older shopping streets around Japan.  Now slowly being replaced by more modern safeguards and alarm systems, these clunky old shutters are evocative of childhood shopping excusions with parents and have a certain forlorn beauty to most Japanese.  This unusual fabric fuses parallel strips of nylon tape into an overall pattern associated with the city streets.",
