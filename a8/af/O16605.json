Praised for their outstanding beauty as reflected in their sumptuous glazes, refined forms and elegant decorations, they are seen to exemplify one of the highlights of Korean culture. Produced in Korea during the Koryo kingdom (918-1392), they reached the zenith of their perfection in technology, form and decoration in the twelfth to thirteenth centuries. The word \u2018celadon\u2019 derives from the colour of the robe worn by Celadon, hero of L\u2019Astr\u00e9e, a pastoral drama by Honor\u00e9 d\u2019Urf\u00e9, a French dramatist of the seventeenth century. Today the term is used for both Chinese and Korean stonewares with glazes of grey-green to bluish-green hues.\nDating to the early twelth century, this elegant vase with swelling shoulders and a narrow base is a fine example of celadon ware of the Koryo dynasty. This type of shape is called maebyong; it was very common at the time. An incised lotus scroll flows gracefully over the entire surface. It is covered with a shiny, clear blue-green glaze.",
