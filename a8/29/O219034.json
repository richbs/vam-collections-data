Built on a long and narrow site, it is\ndesigned to suggest an ancient Roman wall still in\nthe process of construction. The brickwork, which\nhad to be undertaken by Italian bricklayers, was\ntied in every two courses into the framework as a\nsafeguard against earthquakes. In front of the\nbrick facade is a cast-iron screen carrying\nsculptural figures by Jessica Thomas, with\nstaircases weaving in and out of the facade. The\ninteriors were not designed by BCA. The adjacent\nsite was developed shortly afterwards to designs by\nBCA. (see E.299.1-2-1994)\nLiterature: Rick Poyner, Nigel Coates: The City in\nMotion, 1989\n...\n\n          The Tower. Design for the Penrose Institute of\n          Contemporary Arts, Tokyo, later known as the Arts\n          Silo, 1991. Two presentation perspectives of the\n          elevation showing the exterior cladding and the\n          floor arrangements on a transparent sheet\n          overlaying a sheet of collage.\n          Signed in indian [sic] ink <u>Coates '91.</u> Lettered with the\n          titles of the various floors. Lettered in printed\n          job description <u>Penrose Institute of Contempo</u><u>rary </u>\n         <u> Arts, Tokyo.</u>\n          Pen and indian [sic] ink, watercolour on tracing paper,\n          collage\n          59 x 42 cm                                                       E.299.1-2-1994\n\n          Leaving an 18 inch earthquake gap from The Wall to \n          allow for movement, this design was the result of a \n          compromise between the client's wish for a \n          classical structure and Coates's vision of \n          something more  industrial. Originally to be faced \n          in polished copper to tone with The Wall, \n          terracotta was used in order to save money. It was \n          originally designed as commercial  gallery space. \n          Shortly after construction began, it was to be let \n          to the Penrose Institute, a Japanese outpost of the \n          ICA, but they pulled out of the project before \n          completion.
