The enamelled coat of arms on the silver-gilt handle is probably that of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem but appears to be superimposed on another shield, presumably when the bowl changed ownership. The silver-gilt mount around the bowl seems to incorporate the date 1521 but the stone vessel is probably much earlier. The original mounts were possibly replaced in the 16th century to bring the object up-to-date or to repair damage.",
