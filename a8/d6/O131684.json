The top and mid-rails are carved with guilloche ornament. The arms are shaped distinctively in a flattened, undulating triangle, and are shallow-carved on the outer face with a stylised fern leaf in elevation.\n\nThe back uprights are single pieces, with integral scratch moulding, and bead where they border the back panel.The front legs and arms supports are turned, and squared at the joints. The legs are united by four rectangular stretchers. The main joints are double-pegged except for the arms which are triple-pegged, front and back. The top rail is tenoned into the the back uprights.\n\nA small hole (purpose unclear) has been drilled at the top of the back panel, off-centre.\n\nRepairs and modifications \nThe side and back stretchers possibly replaced. Four feet clad with sheet metal (painted), screwed and nailed. The seat appears to be original, supported on a new sub-panel. The front, back and right rails may be replacements.",

The large size, impressive carved back panel and turned spindles of this armchair all contribute to its imposing character. A cushion would usually have been used on the board seat.\n\nThis chair has several distinctive design features - notably the prominent turned spindles, shaped arms and eye-catching carved panel with intertwined serpents, an ancient motif used traditionally in the area, combined with renaissance guilloche ornament. These relate it to a small group of similar armchairs that were probably made in the area bordering England and Wales. Like most 17th century furniture it has been repaired, notably on its feet where unusual metal sheet braces have been added.",
