His hat has a scallop shell on the front, and he is bearded with eyes that are carved, rather than left flat for painting.  A tasselled bag decorated with a scalllop shell hangs at his right-hand side, with its strap across his body from his left shoulder.  A cloak hangs over his shoulders, and he has bare feet.\n\nGenerally the figure is in good condition, although the staff is broken and his right toes are chipped. The only paint on the figure consists of slight traces of red on the book and slight traces of blue in the folds of the cloak.\n\nThe back of the figure has a single hole.",

These, with the line of whelk shells down the front of his robe, indicate his status as a pilgrim.  Pilgrimage to Santiago da Compostela, Spain, where his relics were venerated, was extremely popular in the later Middle Ages, and the saint was increasingly represented as a pilgrim.  He was one of Christ's apostles, and the first to be martyred.\nThis figure was either an individual image for private devotion, or formed part of a larger altarpiece.  Alabaster producers in the English midlands in the 15th century produced hundreds of figures of saints for similar purposes.",

These attributes indicate his status as a pilgrim.\n\nA shell (usually a scallop shell) became recognised in the Middle Ages as the symbol of pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, Spain (where St James's relics were venerated).
