Both vertical lines in the grid are produced by the meeting edges, whereas the horizontal lines are drawn in pencil. The lines that divide the format are thus actual and apparent divisions - drawn edge, and edge itself - and they are given equal functions in the dissection of the surface. Through this juxtaposition Smith intends to disclose the normally latent conventions and assumptions that comprise the visual language of representation. Conventionally line is used as a symbol for an edge. Here we have the reality of edge contrasted with its representation in such a way that the language is revealed as a system of symbols. \n\nThe avant garde of the 1960s and 1970s theorized that 20th-century art had evolved, and should evolve, in the direction of an explicit decoration of its essence. To the extent that his work provides empirical evidence concerning the nature of visual language, Smith's importance can be measured in relation to this theoretical background. Yet in some ways his painting operates very differently. Self-definition and efforts towards maximum differentiation between the arts had produced styles in painting and sculpture now called Minimal Art. In this scheme painting was seen as having only two dimensionality - flatness - as a unique property and all references to objects and subjects outside of the painting itself were proscribed. \n\n<i>Four Knots Series, No.6</i> evades and perhaps criticizes this classification in its distortion of a flat plane into a three-dimensional object with internal edges. Supplementing this is the use of string and knots as constructive elements. Here the allusion is to the packaging theme that has dominated Smith's painting since the 1960s and which, in his own words, has allowed him to remain 'close to the sensibility, ethos almost, of objects and themes from present-day life.' \n\nChristopher Titterington\"",
