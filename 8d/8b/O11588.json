It is not exactly known what they were used for but they may have been made for banquets and wedding feasts. The inscription and the symbols of love, certainly suggest that this particular vase was intended to celebrate an engagement or a wedding.\n\nMaterials & Making\nBy 1500 the small town of Deruta had developed into a well known pottery production centre. A speciality of the town was golden-yellow lustre decoration. This was achieved by introducing brushwood into the kiln towards the end of the firing process. The resulting thick smoke creates an oxygen-starved 'reducing' atmosphere, which reacted with the lustre pigments. The process required highly specialised skills and the kiln losses were considerable, which explains the high price commanded by lustred earthenware.",
