In between this and the circular frame, leafy sprays in blues holding assorted flower and bud forms in turquoise, white, pink, dark red and light green.  These colours are echoed in the circular frame.  Four smaller black circles are placed outside the main circle each containing a floral motif in white, light green and beige.  Alternating with these are large black ground compartments containing a complex floral arrangement.\nSmall white circles [possibly representing pearls] have been used to create the outlines. The remainder of the dark red ground is covered with flowers including tulips and rosebuds.  The dark red ground has been pieced top and bottom before being embroidered but in the top left hand corner there is a piece which may have been cut from along the right hand side of this panel and in the top right hand corner there is a piece which seems to have come from another embroidery.\nNote: it seems strange to embroider a panel and then cut through the embroidery.  \nBorders:\n[1] narrow yellow border\n[2] black border with red ovoid shapes and light blue circles and small light green rosettes linked by white or yellow stitching.  Pieced, cutting through the embroidery.\n[3] narrow red border\n[4] pale turquoise ground, pieced in several places cutting through the embroidery.  Two undulating lines almost forming lobed ovals each containing a red or black circle with smaller red rosettes off-set to the side.\n[5] yellow border.\nNote: the black fabric either was never felted or the 'fuzz' or pile has worn away as it has on some of the other colours.\nEmbroidery thread: 2S silk; white, yellow, light yellow, light blue, black, 2 pinks, purple, green.\nInset wool: dark red, light turquoise, beige, light brown, white, light green, dark brown, black, dark blue or purple, yellow, red.\nFacing: bias cut, plain weave silk; stripes.  Red weft.  Warp: yellow, light blue, white, red, dark blue, green.\nBacking: roller-printed cotton twill; yellow ground, off-set pattern; red and green with white details.  The design forms vase like compartments possibly imitating shawl patterns.\n\nThere is no applied cord or embroidery to disguise the seams.  It appears to have been assembled from different pieces with an older and better quality central panel.",
