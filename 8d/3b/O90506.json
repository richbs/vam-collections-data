            "public_access_description": "The netsuke is a toggle. Japanese men used netsuke to suspend various pouches and containers from their sashes by a silk cord. Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hard-wearing. Above all, they had to have the means for attaching a cord. Netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated being the katabori (shape carving), a three-dimensional carving, such as this one in the form of Ashinaga (Long Legs) and Tenaga (Long Arms) holding a fish. \n\nDuring the early 17th century when katabori netsuke were first made, Chinese influence was strong. As a result, many Chinese illustrated books reached Japan, often in the form of encyclopaedia. One of the most important was the profusely illustrated Sancai tuhui (Tripartite picture assembly), published around 1610. Such works presented an exotic mixture of fact and fiction that was highly appealing. Of particular interest were the illustrations of fabulous beasts and mythical people, such as Ashinaga and Tenaga. These two figures represent the benefits of mutual assistance. With his long legs, Ashinaga was frequently portrayed wading into deep water, while Tenaga fished from his back with his long arms.\n\nThe appearance of Chinese illustrated books in Japan also coincided with the development of a thriving ivory-carving industry centred on the coastal regions of southern China, particularly Zhangzhou in Fujian province. This catered in large part for Portuguese and Spanish missionaries based throughout Asia. Through Japanese contact with China at this time, Chinese carvings reached Japan and played a crucial role in the development of netsuke. Ivory was subsequently one of the most important and widely used materials for the manufacture of netsuke, as with this example.",
