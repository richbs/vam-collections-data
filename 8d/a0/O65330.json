Buddha is holding his sanghati with his left hand and his right arm is placed in front of his body, as if blessing the ascetic.   Behind the Buddha is Vajrapani, youthful and vigorous, holding a thunderbolt.  Three monks, two with shaven heads are in the baackground.\n\n(B): On the  lowe panel,  the Buddha is seated in teaching attitude with worshippers standing on either side.  His head is set against a large nimbus behind which blossoming branches of the bodhi tree emerges. On his left two worshippers and a monk in the background appear.   On the right an elderly ascetic with a full beard and tangled hair approachs the Buddha, in full veneration. Behind him are three other worshippers.",
