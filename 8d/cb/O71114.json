Enamellers embellished the sheets with champlev\u00e9 enamel (minai</i) . In spite of their rich materials, the chair and footstool were designed to fold up so that they could travel easily.  The metalwork suggests that they were made in Lucknow. Enamel was a speciality of the city, in particular the use of  green, blue and yellow on a silver ground as on this chair.  This chair is highly portable, which suggests that it was made specifically for use by a high-ranking East India Company official.",
