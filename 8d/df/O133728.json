A few works by Pier Francesco survived borrowing the style of such great masters of his time as Gozzoli, Domenico Veneziano but also Piero della Francesco and Perugino.\n\nThis painting bears many similarities with the art of Pier Francesco Fiorentino who developed a style inspired from Benozzo Gozzoli's art and was inspired by the other great masters of his time. This detached fresco shows two figures of saints side by side, St John the Baptist on the left and St Dorothea (or St Elizabeth of Hungary) on the right. This was probably part of a large fresco decoration including a main piece representing a scene with the Virgin and Christ, flanked by a series of saints.",

Before 1800,</u> London, Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, pp. 220-221,cat. no. 273.\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\nPIER Francesco Fiorentino (active 1474-97)\nFlorentine School \nA priest, trained as an artist in Florence, where he was a follower of Benozzo Gozzoli, he was active mainly in San Gimignano and its vicinity. Two documents attest his activity as a painter in 1474 and there are two signed paintings in S. Agostino at San Gimignano and in the Gallery at Montefortino dated respectively 1494 and 1497. \nThe large group of Madonnas deriving from Filippino Lippi and Pesellino (of which CAI.99, no. 274, is a good example), attributed by Berenson to Pier Francesco Fiorentino in 1909, differs considerably from his authenticated works; and this attribution - never accepted by many authorities - was subsequently abandoned by Berenson himself (1932). \n\nLit.

The attribution to Pier Francesco Fiorentino was made by Berenson in his Florentine painters of 1909 and he maintained it in his subsequent lists even when, in 1932, many of his original attributions were given to 'Pseudo Pier Francesco Fiorentino' (see CAI.99; no. 274). Berenson's attribution is fully supported by a comparison with Pier Francesco Fiorentino's two signed works: the altarpiece of 1494 in S. Agostino at San Gimignano (repr. <i>Dedalo</i>, vii, 1926-27, p. 87) and that of 1497 in the Gallery at Montefortino (repr. <i>Inventario delle Cose d'Arte e di Antichita d'Italia, Provincie di Ancona e di Ascoli Piceno</i>, 1936, p. 296). The faces in particular betray the peculiarities of Pier Francesco's mannerisms. \nIn 1869 the saints were described as 'St John the Baptist and St John the Evangelist'. Subsequently the figure on the right was identified as St Dorothea: she is holding the basket of flowers which she sent by an angel to Theophilus, an unbeliever, after her death, as a proof of future life. When Theophilus received the basket he was converted to Christianity. \n\nCondition. Surface considerably worn. \nProv. Bought in 1869 from a Signor Corvisieri for \u00a328. \nLit. B.

            "history_note": "Purchased, 1869\n\nHistorical significance: This fresco painting was previously attributed to Benozzo Gozzoli (ca.1421-1497) with whom Pier Francesco Fiorentino worked on the fresco cycle of the life of St Augustine in San Gimignano. B. Berenson (1909) then reattributed the painting to Pier Francesco Fiorentino on the ground of stylistic similarities with the artist's two signed works: two altarpieces showing a <i>Madonna enthroned with saints</i>, respectively in S. Agostino at San Gimignano (1494) and in the Pinacoteca Fortunato Duranti at Montefortino (1497). \nThe present fresco shows two saints probably from a series of saints. On the left is St John the Baptist identifiable from his tunic of animal's skin that he wears under a large cloak. His traditional attribute, a reed cross with a long slender stem, is here missing but his pointed finger alludes to his designation of Christ as the Redeemer. On the right is either St Dorothea or St Elizabeth of Hungary, sometimes crowned with roses and whose attribute is for both a basket of roses. St Elizabeth of Hungary is also sometimes dressed as a Franciscan nun and is for the Franciscans a symbol of female charity. \nCertain stylistic features of the fresco such as its luminosity and the linear treatment of the figures also suggest comparisons with Giovanni di Francesco, with whom it is likely that Pier Francesco collaborated on the terra verde frescoes of biblical stories in the loggia of Palazzo Rucellai, Florence.\nThis fresco painting bears essential characteristics of Pier Francesco Fiorentino's art such as the sharp outlines of the figures and the clean linearity of the composition. It was probably part of a large wall decoration articulated around a major piece representing a scene from the New Testament including the Virgin and Christ.",

            "historical_context_note": "Fresco painting is among the most complex projects undertaken during the Renaissance. This technique, i.e. painting on wet plaster, originated in the Antiquity (see the surviving fresco of Pompeii, near Naples, destructed during the eruption of the Vesuvius in 79 B.C.), was reintroduced and developed in the late 13th century and the 14th century particularly in the work of the Isaac master, Giotto and his followers and perfected during the Italian Renaissance, culminating in Michelangelo's technological tour de force in the Sistine chapel, Rome (1508-12). This medium was used to decorate large wall areas of both private and public buildings. Such sizable paintings, in which timing was of critical importance, took careful planning and involved a number of assistants. A precise plan in the form of a drawing or of many drawings was required so that the composition would fit exactly on the wall. The artist could draw directly on the wet plaster (this underdrawing technique is called <i>sinopia</i>) or use cartoons (from the Italian word <i>cartone</i>) from which the composition was then transferred onto the wall. Another method of transfer, used especially in the 17th century for vast ceiling frescoes, was squaring, which replaced the time-consuming and costly cartoon technique.",
