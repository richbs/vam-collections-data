The case walls, due to the nature of the decoration, cannot be measured but are at least of 15mm thickness. The case is covered without in leather, tooled and gilt with a border of floral scrollwork and small animals. The lid contains eighteen panels, worked in high relief in coloured glass, containing scenes from Ovid's <i>Metamorphoses</i>, each identified below with a brief title. These scenes are framed with strips of white enamel bearing floral scrollwork. The inner face of the drop-front is divided into five panels, each of which was probably originally set with enamelled plates that have a blue ground and floral motifs (the colours of which have decomposed). Three of these enamelled plates remain; the second and fourth are missing and have been replaced by crudely cut-out engravings of birds and butterflies pasted to the red ground of the wooden backing. Another enamelled panel, similar but containing a head of a woman among the scrollwork, is set above the keyboard. Surrounding all these panels and covering the entire keyboard is a decoration consisting of coloured glass rods, rosettes and sequins, and of small spirals of brass wire. The soundboard is covered with glass rod decoration and contains a rose of <i>c.</i>112mm diameter.\n\nHoward Schott, <i>Catalogue of Musical Instruments in the Victoria and Albert Museum.

Every internal surface not covered by these partly enamelled components is embellished with glass, mainly in the form of polychrome rods, whorls and florets.

The museum has this virginal and a casket, both probably from Austria or southern Germany. They are decorated with strips of glass and glass-paste tableaux that resemble examples made in about 1600 in the ducal workshops of Schloss Ambras, near Innsbruck, in Austria. \n\nPossibly intended primarily for display in a Wunderkammer or as a property in a masque, the instrument was nevertheless designed to be played. A plucked string  still produces a strong, full sound in the tradition of the Flemish virginals. This glass-covered virginal has no known parallel among keyboard instruments, and its maker and provenance remain a mystery. Being a highly decorative and mysterious object, it has acquired a number of romantic associations. These range from Queen Elizabeth of Bohemia to Queen Elizabeth I of England, whose glass virginal was seen by Paul Hentzner, a German traveller, at Hampton Court in 1600. However, what Hentzner saw was also decorated with jewels, the royal cipher and verses in Latin, none of which this instrument has.",

            "history_note": "From 1871 to 1872 this instrument was on loan to the Museum from the Comte de Sartiges, who had been the French Ambassador to the Holy See in the 1860s. At the same time Sartiges lent the 'Golden Harpsichord' from Michele Todini's Galleria Armonica in the Palazzo Verospi in Rome, which entered the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, in 1889 as part of the Crosby Brown collection. \n\nIn 1872 the Museum purchased the virginal for \u00a3140, presumably from Sartiges. When the Museum acquired it, the instrument was described as a spinet and was thought to have been made at Murano, near Venice. However, it is now thought to have been made in Northern Europe; its decoration bears a close relation to that of a casket in the Museum's collection (C.20-1923). The wood casket is decorated with glass rods, whorls and florets and lamp-worked glass reliefs set against faded red silk, directly comparable to the virginal, and was probably made in Venetian glassworks in Hall-in-Tyrol, Austria, in the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century. The similarity between virginal and casket was noted in 1946 by W. B. Honey, who linked them to a third object in the V&amp;A, a glass relief of the <i>Last Judgment </i>(C.105-1947) with lampworked glass figures, probably made in Innsbruck, Austria, in the seventeenth century.\n\nWhen acquired by the museum this instrument had a traditional association with Elizabeth, Queen of Bohemia, the daughter of James I of England, however this claim cannot be substantiated. The virginal has also been linked with a description written in 1598 by the German visitor Paul Hentzner, translated from the Latin by Horace Walpole, of a musical instrument at Hampton Court: 'Here besides is a certain cabinet called 'Paridise' where besides that everything glitters so with silver, gold and jewels, as to dazzle ones eyes, there is a musical instrument made all of glass except the strings.' However, another description of the instrument at Hampden Court by Baron Waldstein in 1600 rules this out, by mentioning jewels as well as glass, the Queen's cypher, and two Latin couplets as part of its decoration.",
