There was plenty of everything except butter and eggs.  Then there were the wonderful clothes.  I had quite forgotten about them in the war.  A French friend took me to meet Jacques Fath who liked tall models.  He made an arrangement with me whereby I would be lent 2 evening dresses and 2 day dresses every season which would be made to measure.  My vendeuse was Madame Dufy, a sister of the painter.  <b>The first dress he made for me he actually draped round me and it was made exclusively for me.  It was pale mauve silk cr\u00eape and was the most lovely dress I had ever worn.</b>\nMiller, L., 'Perfect Harmony' in Wilcox, C., e., <i>The Golden Age of Couture: Paris and London 1947-57</i> (V&A Publications, 2007), pl.5.2\nPhotograph of Fath draping fabric around himself.",
