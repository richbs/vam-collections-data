The triangular patchwork borders are quilted in a linear pattern, and divided by wide borders of yellow and pink silk satin. These yellow and pink borders are quilted with a pattern similar to that seen on eighteenth-century petticoats, with a sun-like motif, trailing leaves and flowers. It is wadded with wool and lined with two printed fustians. Some of the paper templates are still intact.\n\nOuter border of quilted satin and silks. Meandering stem with flowers and leaves. The patchwork is composed of 2.5 inch squares containing matched opposing triangles. Some of the silks are plain, in greens, blues, yellows, pinks, red, buff, white, grey and black with the latter showing paper underneath.\n\nThe lining is of two printed cottons, cut and pierced to form nine large rectangles arranged in three rows of three alternating patterns. The piecing suggests these printed materials came from dresses. In the centre and at the four corners is a printed fustian in red and brown with pencilled blue on a white ground. Design of flowers with curving stems and leaves making scroll-edged compartments filled with five different small patterns, floral and geometric fillings. Repeat is approximately 10.5 inches high and approximately 16.25 inches wide including a half-drop repeat. Another printed cotton is printed in two shades of purple and a red on a white ground, and with a design of red stripes patterned by small flowers left in white outline, and crossed by thin meandering stems bearing flowers and leaves in purple and red. The white stripes between the red are filled with tiny leafy stems. The repeat is approximately 8.5 inches by 7.75 inches.",
