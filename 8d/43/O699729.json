(worked second half of 19th century)</b> \n \nAlbum containing humorous drawings, figure, portrait, landscape and seascape sketches and etchings, all apparently by Sands, collected by Charles Keene; together with poems, photographs, of Sands and Keene, and process prints.  102 sheets mounted in a volume bound in brown cloth, with the front cover embossed, and with the book-plate of Charles Keene inside the back cover. \n<i>Some drawings cut from signed and dated letters.  The etchings mainly signed with the artist's emblem. \nPen and ink; etching.  Size of volume</i> 29.5 x 22.9 cm. \nE.2792-1962 \n \nGiven by Miss Annie Cockerell \n \n<i>Note:</i> Sands, a minor Scottish poet, wrote and illustrated <i>Out of this World; or Life in St. Kilda</i>, Edinburgh [1876]; his <i>King James' Wedding and other Rhymes</i>, Arbroath, 1888, was illustrated by Keene and other artists.  He first met Keene in 1852 and many of the sketches in this album refer to Keene's visits to him in Scotland in 1869, 1871 and again in the early 1870s, and to their mutual interest in the bagpipes.  Like others of Keene's fiends, Sands sent him suggestions for humorous drawings.  His recollections of Keene are quoted by G.S. Layard on pp.123-128 of <i>The Life and Letters of Charles Samuel Keene</i>, London, 1892.  The album came into the possession of the donor's family through Mary Ann Smith, Keene's servant.\"",

He first met Keene in 1852 and many of the sketches in this album refer to Keene\u2019s visits to him in Scotland in 1869, 1871 and again in the early 1870s, and to their mutual interest in the bagpipes.  Like others of Keene\u2019s fiends, Sands sent him suggestions for humorous drawings.  His recollections of Keene are quoted by G.S. Layard on pp.123-128 of <i>The Life and Letters of Charles Samuel Keene</i>, London, 1892.  The album came into the possession of the donor\u2019s family through Mary Ann Smith, Keene\u2019s servant.  The items in this volume were all collected by Charles Keene.",
