Vases of this type would have been used for planting and growing bulbs in season, hence the pierced separate stands which allowed for watering the growing bulbs.  Out of season,  porcelain flowers on painted metal stems are known to have been displayed in vases of this type.  They were usually grouped in pairs with other shapes to form sets known as 'garnitures', and placed on mantelpieces and pieces of furniture, often with mirrors behind them, adding to the rich decorative effect.",
