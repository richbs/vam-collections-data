Treadsole:  Straight. Leather. Stitching holes can be seen in  centre from waist to seat (a V leading into a rough  teardrop shape) and around perimeter of waist and  seat. Some cord remains. Midsole: Of cork (?) Upper:  red leather border in V shape over instep (high  throat). Knop over high throat (missing on one  shoe). Remains of gold leaf along stitching.  Beautifully decorated with cutout floral designs  stitched onto a background layer of gold leaf on  leather. \n\nCoptic footwear was primarily made with leather, often using the turned technique, to produce a slipper or shoe with a straight sole. Slippers often included a rand at the vamp and a fibre padded sole sewn together with prominent stitching or insole tab. They show variation in the form and height of the instep. Shoes were generally slip-ons and also show variation in the form and height of the instep. Footwear was highly decorated in geometric and floral designs. Often a variety of techniques were used in combination, with the most popular being dyeing, gilding, openwork and appliqu\u00e9.",
