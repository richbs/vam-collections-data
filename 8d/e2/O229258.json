This necklace is made from hollow gold beads, as thin as paper, strung on red silk cord, with long yellow silk ribbons to fasten it.  The beads are decorated with applied filigree decoration, which is always described as Etruscan work in Victorian sources.  The same decoration is found on many other kinds of jewellery from northern Italy.\n\nIn the 19th century Italian women usually used silk ribbons to fasten their necklaces and pendants, but these ribbons were fragile and easily destroyed.  The ones shown here are rare survivals, saved by the V&A's early interest in authenticity. \n\nThis necklace was bought for \u00a310 as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
