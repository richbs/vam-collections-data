Twisted ropes about 0.75 inch in diameter are made up of thick cords of cotton covered respectively with twisted blue, red and green wool and white floss silk. One end of the rope ends in a loop bound by a small fixed collar of red wool held in a net of blue wool cords, and the other ends in a large tassel. This is composed of a wooden core covered with red floss silk, the knob held by a net of blue silk cords, the waist wound with yellow floss silk, the bell covered with a criss-cross lattice of flattened strips bound with white floss silk flanked by twisted cords of blue and green silk. At the wider waist three rows of mixed green, white and blue silk loops conceal the top of a fringe of looped twisted cotton covered with white floss silk, and decorated by five strips of bunches of looped silk to match the fringe on the border. The four colours, red, blue, green and yellow are separated by white. Another fringe of the white cords is attached to the underside of the core, the centre of which is filled by a plain wooden bead. The moveable collar holding each set of two tassels together is of turned polished wood covered with white floss silk bound lengthways with blue silk twisted cords, which are in turn held in position at each end and in the middle of the collar by bands of red silk.",
