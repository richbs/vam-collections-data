The photograph was taken for the Manchester Evening News and Chronicle, probably to mark Toby's last performance with Professor Codman on 12th  September 1968. It was very common in the 19th and up to the late 20th centuries for Punch Professors to use live dogs in their shows. Bert had bought Toby from St. John's Market, Liverpool for 7/6d in 1949, and Bert died just two days after the death of Toby in 1969.\n\nBert Codman was a third generation Punch Professor who worked at Colwyn Bay and  Rhos on Sea. His father was Richard Mortimer Codman II (1870-1951) who in 1888 had  taken over the Punch & Judy show outside Liverpool's Lime Street Station that had been  established by his father, Richard Codman I (1832-1909).",
