It is unfinished, so that the process of its creation can be clearly seen, from the drawing out of the design onto the ground  fabric, to the outline stitches and start of the filling stiches. It also clearly shows  how the tension of the embroidery stitches has caused the ground to pucker,  which would have had to be remedied when the work was finished. It is perhaps  the extremity of the puckering in this case that caused the piece to be put aside  without completion. \n\tBecause it was not completed it has not been used or displayed and thus exposed  to light, so its colours (harmonious shades of green) are exceptionally good still.",
