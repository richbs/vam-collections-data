Dresser was keenly interested in Japanese art and design and this shape derives from Japanese (and Chinese) vases. Mottled, bubbled glass became popular as excavated Roman glass took hold of designers' imagination. Like most 'art pottery' this is a sculptural work first and foremost.\n\nPlace\n'Clutha' is the ancient, Roman name for a river god and the River Clyde. This vase was made by James Couper & Sons in Glasgow, which stands on the Clyde. Dresser's bubbled, Roman-style 'Clutha' glass was sold exclusively through the avant-garde shop, Liberty's in London, which registered it in 1888.\n\nPeople\nDresser's glass was sold by the London shop Liberty's, founded by Arthur Lasenby Liberty as an emporium, importing goods from Asia. Soon Liberty's turned to British design, pioneering the Aesthetic style and then the shop's own version of art nouveau, known abroad as Stile Liberty.",

Vases with elongated slightly bent necks were inspired by Japanese, Persian and Indian water sprinklers acquired by the South Kensington Museum during the 1870s and 1880s. Clutha glass was shown alongside Sowerby's Art Glass at an exhibition organised by the Art Furnishers' Alliance in 1882. The show attracted considerable attention in the press and the <font -u>Cabinet Maker</font> announced, 'A new kind of glass of English manufacture which in point of artistic merit and originality promises to rival the finest examples of the old Venetian glass-blowers.'",
