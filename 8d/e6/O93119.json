It is part of a larger album entitled Chiyoda no Mi Omote.\n\nWith peace established in Japan after centuries of warfare, the ruling samurai class found themselves in the complicated position of having no battles to fight, but under strict government orders to maintain their warrior traditions. Many samurai were employed ruling in the provinces, but many others, particularly in the large cities, found themselves idle, and the class became somewhat anomalous although their right to rule was never questioned. Under the relatively stable Tokugawa Shogunate and the prevailing intellectual climate of the times, codes of behaviour evolved founded on both Confucian beliefs and the Japanese tradition of absolute loyalty and willingness to die for one's master. This led to the development of the concept of 'Bushido', or the 'way of the warrior'. \n\nOne way of maintaining martial readiness was to train with the sword.  Some schools used real swords, others blunted weapons. The main form of practise was through the establishment of dedicated schools ('dojo') for traditional sword fencing, known as kendo (the 'way of the sword') that used split bamboo swords. Schools of kendo developed as a direct result of the establishment of peace in Japan and the resulting lack of any real opportunity to use the sword in battle. Many of the schools of kendo were established by former masterless samurai ('ronin') who were especially keen to maintain their martial traditions. Sword fighting techniques became somewhat formalised and ritualised with some particular schools of kendo developing fighting actions that utilised large, rounded cutting actions.",
