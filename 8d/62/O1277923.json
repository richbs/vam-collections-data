The submarine has been included to show the mirroring of weaponry of the Cold War period. The Nautilus submarine and Corporal missile were early nuclear innovations of the 1950s, first developed in America. These accurate toy versions reflect the rapid development of weapons during the arms race. They also  show the toy industry\u2019s ability to quickly replicate it for a  public fascinated by the atomic age.\nToys and games have been used to recruit, normalise or to instil a sense of militarism in children. This has been evident in war toys made for children for hundreds of years and is one of the key messages for the exhibition.  These toys work within the permanent collection to show the extent to which messages, values and ideas can be instilled to directly to children through their playthings.",
