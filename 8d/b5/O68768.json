The viewer is led to think that they are delicious at first glance, yet a closer look reveals that they are completely inedible: this work plays with expectations. This print was part of a set published by the Space Studios in London in 2002. The book Space Cooks included works by 103 leading contemporary artists, all inspired by food.",
