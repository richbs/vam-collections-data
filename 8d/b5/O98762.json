Headache/Phone Card/Soda/Donuts/Stereo was a commission by Platform for Art and Frieze Foundation. A series of 5 posters - produced in a range of sizes and colourways - was installed at Great Portland Street tube station to coincide with the Frieze Art Fair in 2003. This was held in Regents Park, and Great Portland Street was the nearest station for visitors to the fair. Gillick\u2019s work to date has focused on the grey area where architecture, design and art intersect. His posters for this project featured simple typography, strong pattern and single colours. The work made use of transcripts from non-specific fictional television advertising \u2013 transposing the structure of one communication medium into the format of another. The format \u2013 and structure \u2013 of the message overwhelms the product; the result is ambiguous, and ineffectual; the narrative and presentation thwart each other \u2013 and the conventional visual and graphic impact of the poster medium is sabotaged. The essence of the poster \u2013 that its message must be legible to an audience on the move \u2013 was undercut by these posters which are dense with text and veiled imagery.",
