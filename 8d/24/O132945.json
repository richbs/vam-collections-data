His most noted projects include the city's School of Art and the Willow Tea Rooms, but he also built and decorated houses for private clients, including \u2018Windyhill\u2019 in Kilmacolm and \u2018The Hill House\u2019 in Helensburgh.\n\nThis trunk stand or luggage rack comes from a suite made for Mr and Mrs Sidney Horstman of Bath. In 1917 they commissioned Mackintosh  to renovate their house. Though he worked in only part of the house, he created startling differences in each room. The guest bedroom was furnished with dark mahogany, including this trunk stand. Some of the larger pieces in the suite were decorated with inlay. Mackintosh designed a very similar suite for the guest bedroom of 78 Derngate, Northampton, the home of Mr and Mrs W.J. Bassett-Lowke. \n\nThe furniture for the Horstmans' house was constructed by prisoners of war on the Isle of Man in 1917.",
