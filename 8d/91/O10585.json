There seems to have been little distinction in the early 17th century between patterns thought suitable for men and for women. The complexity of the woven structure and the quantity of metal thread incorporated would have made the fabric highly expensive. The silver thread is now rather tarnished and worn, but would originally have glittered with movement.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe silk has been altered at some stage since its first use, and made up into a cover or small hanging. The intrinsic value of such a silk made it worthwhile reusing it in a different form when it had ceased to be fashionable for dress, or even when damaged or worn. This panel has been carefully assembled from a number of pieces of varying size.\n\nPeople\nThe design and colouring of this silk are very similar to that of the silk in a dress worn by Anne of Denmark (1574-1619), wife of James I (ruled 1603-1625), in a painting by Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger  (1561-1636). Peacock feathers were considered an appropriate symbol for a queen, since the bird was sacred to Juno, wife of Jupiter, King of the Roman gods.",
