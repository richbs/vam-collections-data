Set in the hall of Monkswell Manor, the play starred the popular husband and wife Sheila Sim and Richard Attenborough, and went on to become a British institution, famous for being famous. The critic Cecil Wilson wrote: 'The play has the expert merit of keeping us guessing to the very end', but even Agatha Christie was quite bemused by its popularity, saying: 'It's not really frightening. It's not really horrible. It's not really a farce. But it has a little of all these things and perhaps that satisfies a lot of people'.\n\nLike other posters of its time, this is simply and clearly designed, featuring photographs of the stars, and crediting the full cast. The use of red and black lettering perhaps unwittingly echoes the earliest theatre posters of the 17th century which sometimes used red ink as well as black to attract the attention of playgoers.",
