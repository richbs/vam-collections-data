Moss, was made to be folded in three like a paper programme, but was in silk to commemorate the opening night of The Palace Theatre Hull, on 6th December 1897. This one of the music halls built by Horace Edward Moss (1852-1912) in the late 19th century, and was part of the group known then as 'The Liverpool, Leeds and Hull Empire Palaces Limited'.  Later the group became known as the Moss Empires Variety Theatres, and at its peak comprised thirty-three theatres, the largest chain known in the world. \n\nDesigned by the prolific theatre architect Frank Matcham, the Palace was a sumptuous theatre featuring electric light and a sliding roof over the auditorium which seated 1,800.  By 1897 over 40 theatres in Great Britain had been built to Matcham's designs, and in 1897 alone Matcham-designed theatres opened in Stoke Newington, Crouch End, Dublin, Hull, Nottingham, Aberdeen, Glasgow and London's Edgware Road.  The Palace Theatre was enlarged in 1928 and closed in 1929, reopened in 1951, and renamed the Continental Palace in 1957.  It finally closed in 1965 and was demolished the following year.",
