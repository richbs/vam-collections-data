            "public_access_description": "In 1564, the Mughal emperor Akbar visited the house of  a man called Khwaja Mu\u2019azzam. At a time when Mughal authority was frequently challenged, rebellions broke out frequently and occasional attempts were made on Akbar's like. On this occasion, Akbar sensed that one of the Khwaja\u2019s Gujarati servants was about to kill him. He swiftly ordered one of his own men, Qutlaq Qadam Khan, to strike first. The unnamed artists who designed the composition and applied the colours vividly depict the incident described in the Persian text . The would-be attacker was instantly decapitated and, in the words of Henry Beveridge's English translation, \u2018for a moment the trunk remained standing and the black blood spouted from the arteries of the neck\u2019. The event took place in 1564, and was illustrated in this partial copy of the text written by  Abu'l Fazl between about 1590 and 1595. On the reverse is another painting (IS.2:38-1896) thought to be by the same, unidentified artist.\nThe Akbarnama (Book of Akbar) was commissioned by the emperor Akbar in 1589 as the official chronicle of his reign.  It was written by Abu'l Fazl and substantially complete by 1596. The illustrations were being prepared as the historian drafted and rewrote the textby at least 49 different artists from Akbar's Ketabkhana, or \"House of Books\", where manuscripts were stored as well as created.. After Akbar's death in 1605, this incomplete manuscript remained in the library of his son, Jahangir (r. 1605-1627), who recorded his ownership on the flylife.  The  Museum purchased it in 1896 from Mrs Frances Clarke, the widow of Major-General John Clarke who bought it in India while serving as Commissioner of Oudh between 1858 and 1862.",

            "history_note": "The Akbarnama was commissioned by the emperor Akbar as the official chronicle of his reign. It was written by his court historian and biographer Abu'l Fazl between 1590 and 1596 and is thought to have been illustrated between about 1592 and 1594 by at least 49 different artists from Akbar's studio. After Akbar's death in 1605, the manuscript remained in the library of his son, Jahangir (r. 1605-1627) and later Shah Jahan (r.1628-1658). The Victoria and Albert Museum purchased it in 1896 from Mrs Frances Clarke, the widow of Major-General John Clarke, who bought it in India while serving as Commissioner of Oudh between 1858 and 1862.\n\nHistorical significance: This is thought to be the first illustrated copy of the Akbarnama. It drew upon the expertise of some of the best royal painters of the time, many of whom receive special mention by Abu'l Fazl in the A'in-i-Akbari. The inscriptions in red ink on the bottom of the paintings name the artists.",
