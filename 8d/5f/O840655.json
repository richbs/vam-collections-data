These are based on a series of paintings by Domenico Tiepolo in the Oratorio del Crucifies (Oratory of the Crucifix) in the Church of S. Polo, Venice. The artist completed the painting in 1747. Plate IX from the series of prints is dated 1748. The title page bears the date 1749, implying that the project was finished in this year. The canvases of the Stations of the Cross are amongst the earliest works by Domenico Tiepolo. They are close in style and composition to paintings by his father, the celebrated artist Giambattista Tiepolo, with whom he had trained and continued to work throughout his life. The fact that prints were made  soon after completion of the canvases, demonstrates the potential it was felt they had for reproduction. The fourteen scenes of the stations of the cross are presented following the Venetian tradition for this subject. Such prints would have been a popular series of devotional images. They were produced in six states. The series in the V&A collection (inventory numbers: E.1287-1907 to E.1301-1907) are second states of the series,  recognised by the inscription <I>In Venezia</I> written at the bottom of the title page.\n\nHere the dedication is made to the Venetian patron of the arts Alivise Cornaro. (describe what the dedication says).",
