His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean. \n\nThe Sleeping Beauty, first performed by the Sadler's Wells (now Royal) Ballet in 1946, is Messel's most enduring production in Great Britain.  He designed over one thousand costumes for the many revivals of this production between 1946 and 1970.   \n\nHe also produced concepts for a film production of the ballet during the 1950s which never materialised.  His synopsis for the film shows that he planned to place the fairies in settings which they magically leave to give Princess Aurora gifts at her christening. The Fairy of the Crystal Fountain is seen \u2018rising from a magic fountain set in an arcaded pool in the garden of the Palace.  She brings the water of health in a crystal goblet.\u2019 (Oliver Messel\u2019s Preliminary  Synopsis)",

Oliver Messel first designed costumes and sets for a Sadler's Wells (now Royal) Ballet production at the Royal Opera House, London on 20 February 1946. This performance marked the re-opening of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, as a theatre after its war-time use as a dance hall. It was also performed on 9 October, 1949 at the Metropolitan Opera House, New York, the production with which the Royal Ballet conquered New York. \nIt was revised on a number of occasions most notably in 1952 and 1960  when several of the costumes as well as choreography and the production were reworked and was mounted in 1959 for the Royal Ballet Touring Company.  It remained in performance by the Royal Ballet companies for twenty five years.  Sarah Woodcock said of this production \u201c<i>The Sleeping Beauty</i> was to be Messel\u2019s biggest and most enduring production \u2026 The production was performed nearly one thousand one hundred and fifty times, from London to Los Angeles, from Leeds to Leningrad, becoming the Company\u2019s \u2018signature ballet\u2019.\u201d (Pinkham, ed., 1983).\nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's theatre designs and other designs and artefacts.  The designs were briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being housed at the V&A from 1981 on indefinite loan.  The V&A Theatre Museum purchased the Oliver Messel collection from Lord Snowdon in 2005.\n\nHistorical significance: Messel's costume and set designs for the Sadler's Wells Ballet production of <i>The Sleeping Beauty</i> in 1946 became the definitive stage designs for the ballet, enduring many revivals to 1970.",
