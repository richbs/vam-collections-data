The width of the stripes matches so well that it seems likely these bands were produced in the same workshop.  Perhaps it was a tidy way to create a fabric of the required length or perhaps there was a technical reason with this to do with tension. See T.191-1921 for similar effect.\nSelvedges: returned weft with a stretched cord attached later.\nAn example of very fine weaving.",
