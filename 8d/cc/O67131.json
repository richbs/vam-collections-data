It remains one of the most popular carpet patterns and appears with many variations:  radically different effects can be achieved by simply changing the proportion of the  motifs or by using colour to highlight particular parts of it. This is a balance and controlled design but an element of fun has been introduced in the middle of the upper border, to the side of the woven date: there is an animal and above it, a small human figure wearing a brightly striped garment. Below and to one side of the animal is the islamic date 1277AH which corresponds to1860-61 AD.",
