As usual Irving spared no expense on the production, and although it was praised for its lavish settings and costumes, critics regretted that the Poet Laureate had not written a more coherent play. Ellen Terry however was praised for her performance and her appearance, and the critic Henry Labouch\u00e8re in the magazine Truth praised her 'skill in giving life to drapery', calling her 'this graceful and picturesque creature....the embodiment of the aspirations of modern art'.\n\nIn her memoirs Ellen Terry recalled her dresses for the role as 'simple, fine and free' - 'designed by Mr. Godwin, one of them the toga made of that wonderful material which Arnott had printed'. Ellen Terry was first employed by Sir Henry Irving at the Lyceum Theatre in 1878; she was his leading lady until 1902 and their on-stage partnership became one of the most famous in the history of the theatre.",
