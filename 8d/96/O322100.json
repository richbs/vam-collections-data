The pipes are ivory mounted and the keys are of brass, octagonally shaped. The holes are marked as in 21/5, save that the left hand pipe has a seventh hole marked C#. [Those of 21/5 (Museum no. W.23-1925) are marked as follows: 'The holes in the left pipe are marked from the highest <i>B,A,G,F,E,D</i> ... The right pipe holes are marked <I>G,F,E,D</i> ...'].  The keys on this pipe (left) are marked <i>E flat</i> (high up) and <i>F natural</i> (lower down the pipe). Those of the right-hand pipe are marked <i>C, B</i> and (low down) <i>Low C key</i>. The bass pipe, connected to the back of the head by a short tube, uses a boxwood cylinder 31 cm long and slightly tapered, with its widest bore, 24.5 mm, at the top end. At 14 cm from the top it is closed by a cork. The bottom end carries a boxwood bed, 14 cm long, for resting the instrument on the chair. The four keys on this pipe are marked <i> D key, C key, B key and A key </i>, and a short protruding tube is marked <i>F natural</i>.'\n- Anthony Baines: <i>Catalogue of Musical Instruments in the Victoria and Albert Museum - Part II: Non-keyboard instruments</i> (London, 1998), p. 90.",

By then the fashion for these instruments was waning: professionals preferred the flute and amateurs found double and triple flageolets too complicacted to play.",
