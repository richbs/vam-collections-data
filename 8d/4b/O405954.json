Displayed on the stand and saucer respectively are two and three running five-clawed dragons among densely-piled clouds, with clouds alone round the underside and the stem. A neat key-fret border encircles the mouth rim and a five-ribbed band the rim of the saucer. The inside is lacquered black.\nNote: Cleaned December 1980",
