The front shows two children indoors: the boy is wearing a blue shirt, striped tie and yellow shorts, and is kneeling on the floor painting a picture of a vase of marguerites, poppies and cornflowers; the girl, in a red dress, is propped on her elbows beside him, with a doll's tea-party set out next to her.  The wording reads\nWISHING YOU A Jolly Birthday TO-DAY !\nwith \nYOU ARE 6 YEARS OLD made visible inside by cutting away the top right corner of the front; the large figure six is embossed with a design of children playing and is printed in gold.  Inside is an illustration of the two children with paintings and the paintbox; the verse reads:\nHere's a special Birthday rhyme\nTo hope you'll have a happy time,\nWith all your wishes coming true\nFor sunny skies the whole day through\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR !",
