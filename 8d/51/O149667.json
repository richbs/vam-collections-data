The cover, which had three lugs on the underside and was surmounted by a figure of a fiddler and his dog, had the glaze almost intact, except for two key points of the inscription  which had been chipped off, apparently with a chisel-like instrument. The inscription ran: Play up Jack and then you shall drink. Come sit a down and merry be and think my Master comfort be. Give to poor fiddler more drink more drink, o give to poor fiddler more drink. ED [abraded] Maker Fremington Pottery , December 16 [abbraded].\nThe name of the maker almost certainly 'Fishley', possibly Edmund Fishley [illegible] of Fremington 1839-1861 or his son E.B. Fishley (d.1912). A nineteenth century date seems likely from the look of the script and from the fact that the date was worth removing. Either a survival or a revival of an earlier Devon style.",
