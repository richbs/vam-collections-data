He was accepted at the Royal Academy Schools at the age of 15, and in 1863 he won a gold medal for a religious painting. He exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy from 1864 until his death. Holl specialised in a melancholy, even morbid strain of genre painting, and in the 1870s won popular success with paintings on the themes of social problems, illness and mortality. \n\nIn the late 1870s Holl became a successful and prolific portrait painter. This early exercise in the genre is a portrait of the artist's younger brother as a child. It was given to the V&A in 1958 by Mrs C.M. Baker through the Art Fund, along with Holl's painting of a young girl, Ellen Sarah Gibbs (P.2-1958) who was later to become the artist's sister-in-law. Also included in the gift was an oil sketch of the head of a Welsh fishergirl (P.3-1958). The small boy and girl are portraits of Mrs Baker's parents as children.",
