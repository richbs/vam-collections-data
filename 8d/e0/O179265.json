He is best known by these later works, but earlier works, like this drypoint  made in 1940, suggest he was energetically experimenting with form and a technique of 'drawing'  of a more spontaneous nature, which relates to the surrealist technique of automatic writing. The title of this piece suggests that Albers may have drawn the image very fast, or was trying to express an visual equivalent of speed. At this time Albers was teaching at Black Mountain College in Carolina, but also making trips to Mexico, which he found very inspiring.",
