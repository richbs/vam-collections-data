                        "label_text": "Bequeathed to the Museum in 1910 by George Salting, it was thought to be a 16th century Persian carpet but in the late 1920s it was recatalogued as Turkish, probably mid-19th century.  Its attribution is still a matter of vigorous debate. \n\nThere is no evidence to support the idea that the Salting Carpet was manufactured in Turkey, except for the fact that it was sold to Mr Salting from Istanbul and that similar carpets are said to have been in the Sultan's collection. The techniques and the designs are appropriate for Persia; there is nothing in the dyes which precludes a Persian origin, indeed the use of juglon (from walnuts) to produce the beige colour is characteristic of Persian carpets and not of Turkish. The inscription is from the 14th century Persian poet, Hafiz (1320-89):\n\n'Call for wine and scatter roses: what do thou seek from Time? - thus spoke the rose at dawn.  O nightingale, what say thou? Take the cushion to the garden, that thou may hold the lip and kiss the cheek of the beloved and the cup-bearer, and drink wine and smell the rose. Proudly move thy graceful form and to the garden go, that the cypress may learn from thy stature how to win hearts. Today while thy market is full of the tumult of buyers, gain and put by a store of the capital of  goodness. Every bird brings a melody to the garden of the King - the nightingale, songs of love, and Hafiz, prayers for blessing.\n\nIf the Salting Carpet and several related pieces are Persian, and it seems probable, we suggest that they were used as state gifts from the Shah to the Sultan, expressing Persian state power and cultural identity and possibly carrying overtones of political propaganda. \n\nWe also suggest that serious consideration is given to the possibility that the Salting Carpet was woven in the 1850s and presented by Shah Nasir al Din (r.1848-1896) to impress on his neighbour his personal wealth and prestige, the skill of his weavers and the rich artistic traditions of Persia.\n\nTechnical Details\n7'7\" x 5'5\" (2.31 x 1.65m)\nWarp: yellow silk; Z2S; varies from 48 to 54 warp threads per inch (192-208 per dm).\nWeft: yellow silk; Z2S; 3 shoots after each row of knots; varies from 25 to 28 knots per inch (94-111 per dm).\nBrocaded Wefts: there are two types woven over three warp threads and under one (i) silver strip Z-twisted around an unplied white silk core (ii) silver strip Z-twisted around a yellow silk core.\nPile: wool; 14 colours; asymmetrical knot open to the left and tied around 2 warp threads; varies from 600 to 756 knots per sq.inch (9,024-11,544 per sq.dm)."

The woven inscriptions in the borders are taken from verses written by the 14th century poet Hafiz. Metal thread has been used to great effect in place of knotted pile, especially in the central medallion. Some authorities say this carpet is a Turkish carpet dating from the middle of the 16th century.  Mr Salting bought it as a 16th century Persian carpet.",
