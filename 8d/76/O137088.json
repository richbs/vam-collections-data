The menacing shark handle and the sweeping wave-like triangular blade are strongly contrasted through the disparity in finish, the blade with a higher reflective polish than the handle. The smooth, sinuous lines of the shark deftly capture the fluidity of movement. Shell-formed with dorsal and side fines cast and soldered onto the body, the handle is technically unusual. Contrasting the smooth surface of the shark the blade is brightly peened along the upsweep and chisel-engraved along the tip with a fleeing school of fish. The shark design is echoed in the saw-tooth tip. The drama and originality of this piece do not compromise its practicality; the solid handle fits comfortably in the hand, and the blade is generously proportioned.",
