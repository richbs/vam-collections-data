The text is as follows: SCHOOL UNKNOWN: late 16th century 600 Design for part of a frieze: a pair of putti supporting a cartouche Pen and ink and wash 4 \u00bc x 4 1/8 (108 x 104) D.573-1887 PROVENANCE Bought 1887 Formerly ascribed to Giuseppe Melani (1673-1747). In the Departmental Register the words \u2018F. Melani Pisa 1742\u2019 are written against this item and no. 600, presumably referring to an inscription which is no longer there. One of the drawings was accordingly ascribed to Francesco Melani (1675-1742) and the other, to his brother Giuseppe (1673-1747), perhaps because it is obviously by a different hand. But both drawings date from the end of the 16th century and cannot therefore be by either of the Melani brothers. The inscription, if there was one, was possibly intended to refer to Alrobello Melone; but neither drawing is by him either.",
