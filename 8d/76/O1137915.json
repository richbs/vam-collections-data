The films captured their imagination and paved the way for the merchandising that accompanies many films today. A whole host of toy figures, spacecrafts and toy guns were available, as well as costumes, stationery, bedroom accessories and slippers.\n\nEpisode 2: Attack of the Clones is a 2002 space opera film directed by George Lucas. It was released on May 16th of that year and was set ten years after the previous film, The Phantom Menace. In Attack of the Clones, Padm\u00e9 Amidala becomes a Senator from the planet Naboo, showing that she has grown since her time as Queen.",
