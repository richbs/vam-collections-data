In this print the original image has been left-right reversed.  \n\nIntriguingly, the catalogue of the <i>Cybernetic Serendipity</i> exhibition at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in 1968 also shows the image printed in reverse (p.87). The V&amp;A's copy comes from the Computer Arts Society, which organised its first exhibition, <i>Event One</i>, in 1969. The catalogue for <i>Event One</i> contains an article by Ken Knowlton, entitled \"Software for Computer Art\". However,  a number of American prints were held up by Customs staff, including a version of the image by Harmon and Knowlton (Catherine Mason, \"The fortieth anniversary of Event One at the Royal College of Art\", paper presented at EVA Conference, London, 2009). The Computer Arts Society went on to organise other exhibitions, so it is possible that the V&amp;A's print was made for <i>Event One</i> or a subsequent show.\n\nThe original picture was 5 feet high and 12 feet wide.  The original is now in the collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art.",
