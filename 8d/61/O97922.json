The carving consists of six figures all with their upper bodies turning to the left looking at something in the lost portion of the relief. On the left side of this fragment at the edge of the jagged broken vertical break stands the figure of the Buddha, with part of his right side now missing. He rises through the full height of the relief, clutching his <i> sanghati</i>, carved with deeply grooved folds, in his left hand.  His strong  oval face with a roundish <i>ushnisha</i> above undulating waves of hair is set  against a large plain nimbus. The remaining portion of the relief is filled with two tiers of figures, all smaller than the figure of Buddha.  Immediately on his left behind him, stands Vajrapani with his legs apart dressed only in a loincloth. His face with beard and tangled hair is now destroyed.  On his bent left arm he has a large thunderbolt leaning against his shoulder. On the right there is a figure of a standing monk with shaven head holding an empty alms bowl.  Above these two is a row of three smaller figures all wearing cockaded turbans and rich jewellery.  The middle figure holds his hands together in the <i>anjalimudra </i>while that to the right holds up a flower. The one closest to the Buddha is shown holding up his hand right hand which is now broken off.",
