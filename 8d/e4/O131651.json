He was a pupil of Hendrick Goltzius and Cornelis Cornelisz. van Haarlem and became a member of the Haarlem Guild of St Luke in 1631. As well as a painter, he was also an architect and a poet.\n\n\nAscribed to Salomon de BRAY \n\n46 \nA LAUGHING CHILD HOLDING A WICKER \nRATTLE \n<i>Oak panel</i> \n19 5/8 X 15\u00bc (50 x 38.5) \nP.48-1962\n \nThe traditional attribution to Salomon de Bray was accepted by Ernst Buchner (1933-34) and the picture was so listed while it was in the Wallraf-Richartz-Museum, Cologne, from 1933 to 1943. However, this attribution, together with that of a group of similar portraits of children, was firmly rejected by J. W. von Moltke in his detailed study of de Bray's work (1938-39). Moltke gave it to the same hand as the <i>Two Boys</i> in the N. G., Dublin, which he also rejected from his catalogue of de Bray's work. The attribution is retained here tentatively, pending a more convincing alternative. \n\n<i>Prov.</i> Frankfurt a/M, Knoeckel sale, 11-2 Dec. 1919, lot 397, repr. (as G. v. Honthorst); 1933, given to the Wallraf-Richartz-Museum, Cologne, by Countess Strachwitz and Baroness Wrede (no. 2459); sold in 943; bought by C. D. Rotch in 1954-55; bequeathed to the Museum in 1962. \n<i>Exh.</i> Duits Gallery, London, December 1954. \n<i>Lit.</i> E.
