To the left of the panel is a castle with two frontal towers, and one towards the back.  It has three central windows, highlighted with blue and purple enamel, while the two front towers each have two further lancet windows, in purple enamel.  The bricks are engraved on the reserved and gilded background.  A male figure (a disciple) stands on the roof of the castle holding the rope from which the basket, containing St Paul, is suspended.  The bearded and saint is depicted half-length within the basket, with his arms raised towards his left, towards two standing male figures (two further disciples).  His halo is blue enamel, and the basket is gilded with details in dark blue enamel.  Along the bottom edge is a border decoration which reaches almost to the right hand edge, in blue and purple enamel.  Along the left edge is a green and gilded border, and along the right edge is a different decorated border, where the enamel has been lost, but the gilding remains.\n\nThere is punched decoration on the castle, and the clothes of all the figures, as well as the lower enamelled border and the basket and ropes.\n\nThe outer edge of the panel has a beaded border.  At two points the design on the plaque stretches out onto this border: the head of the man on the castle, and the left foot of the right-hand standing disciple.\n\nThe reverse of the panel is flat and plain with a few scratches.  There are pin holes in each corner, and eleven holes along the left-hand side, possibly original.\n\nThere is damage between the right-hand wall of the castle and the rope supporting the basket.",

The episode depicted here (St Paul being let down in a basket from the walls of Damascus) immediately preceded his philosophical dispute.  Five other plaques from the same series survive in various other museums.\n\nThe choice of scenes reflects the iconography of Siculo-Byzantine mosaic cycles in Sicily, probably transmitted to England via contemporary manuscripts.  The plaques are thought to be English because of their particularly close links to English manuscript illumination.  Links to wall paintings in St Gabriel's chapel, Canterbury Cathedral have also been pointed out.",

These are suggested as a model by Gauthier 1972.  Both the V&A scenes (M.312-1926 and 223-1874) also appear in a Bible, in the Monastery of S. Paolo fuori le mura, f.307v (illustrated in H. Buchthal, 'Some Representations from the Life of St Paul in Byzantine and Carolingian art', <font -u>Tortulae: Studien zu Altchristlichen und Byzantinischen Monumenten</font -u>, Rome, 1966, pl.12.  Buchthal suggests (p.48) that the scenes' appearance in this manuscript (an enlargement and improvement on previous illustrations depicting the story of St Paul and dated to around 870) implies a source in a lost Byzantine illustration to the Acts of the Apostles.\n\nGauthier 1972 refers to other tenth- and eleventh-century manuscripts illustrating these scenes including the Gradual of Pr\u00fcm (Paris, Bibl.Nat.ms.lat.9442, ff.54-5).",

            "production_note": "Neil Stratford's catalogue entry in <font -u>English Romanesque Art 1066-1200</font -u> stresses the links with Ottonian art in the plaques from this group: specifically in the compositional formulae and the colour palette of the enamels.  But both are seen to be transformed in an essentially English way - there are particularly close links to English manuscript illumination.  He sees them as representing 'a phase of English art in particularly close touch with developments on the other side of the Channel'.  The English attribution is also discussed in detail in the catalogue entry in <font -u>The Year 1200</font -u>, where it is described as 'not conclusive' (a Mosan or lower Saxon source is suggested), although the plaques have 'similarities to later English works'.  <font -u>El Arte Rom\u00e1nico</font -u> catalogue cites similarities with wall paintings in St Gabriel's chapel, Canterbury Cathedral, as well as several manuscript sources.", 
            "historical_context_note": "This plaque and one showing St Paul disputing with the Greeks and Jews (223-1874) almost certainly came from the same object, possibly a large altarpiece or reliquary casket.  The episode depicted here (St Paul escaping from Damascus) immediately preceded his dispute, shown on 223-1874.\n\nFiveother plaques from the same series are in the following museums:\nSt Peter walking on the water (Nuremberg, Germanisches Nationalmuseum KG.609)\nSt Peter affirms Christ's divinity (Dijon, Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts, Collection Trimolet no. 1249)\nSt Paul's conversion on the road to Damascus (Lyon, Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts, objet d'art D.79)\nSt Paul and his disciples (New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 17.190.445)\nSts Peter and Paul proclaiming Christ's divinity (Dijon, Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts, Collection Trimolet no. 1250)",
