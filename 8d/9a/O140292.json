With her large eyes, long neck, high cheekbones and dark hair, Pavlova's looks typified everyone's ideal of a classical ballerina. Born in St Petersburg in 1881, Pavlova was inspired to dance after seeing a production of the ballet The Sleeping Beauty. She trained at the Imperial Theatre School but by 1906 she was associated with the revolutionary ideas of Mikhail Fokine, who choreographed the famous Dying Swan  for her. \n\nLaura Knight was fascinated by the theatre, ballet and the circus, and was thrilled when she first saw Pavlova dance with her partner Michael Mordkin, probably in London during their 1910 tour. Even when she lived in Cornwall, Laura Knight spent months in London every year and loved watching the ballet at the Empire Theatre and the Palace Theatre.  This drawing is undated and may have been executed at the Palace Theatre season in 1911 when Pavlova was partnered by Laurent Novikov, or later when Laura Knight sketched her for a book at her house in Hampstead .",
