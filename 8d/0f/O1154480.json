The pleated skirt flares out from the dancer's hips in to a wide swirling hem, banded in green and decorated with white and gold flowers. In her right hand the dancer carries a pale yellow fan and she has a thin purple shawl cast over her right shoulder. Her left arm is encased in a tight dark green sleeve painted with floral motifs which reaches to a point just above her elbow. Her hair is very elaborately dressed with a large group of scarlet flowers above her right ear and a high delicate comb at the back from which a purple mantilla, painted with swirling gold motifs is suspended.",
