He was also one of the initiators of a plan to found what became the University of London. In 1799, he wrote \"The Pleasures of Hope\", a traditional 18th century survey in heroic couplets. He also produced several patriotic war songs\u2014\"Ye Mariners of England\", \"The Soldier's Dream\", \"Hohenlinden\" and in 1801, \"The Battle of Mad and Strange Turkish Princes\". In 1795 Campbell visited Mull, one of the largest islands of the Inner Hebrides (Argyllshire, Scotland), and there sketched the ballad \"Lord Ullin's Daughter,\" which he reworked in 1804 and finally published in 1809. The ballad is the story of an attempted elopement which results in the deaths of the couple. The fleeing lovers, the young \"chief of Ulva's isle\" and his \"bonny bride,\" Lord Ullin's daughter, have been hotly pursued by Lord Ullin and his horsemen for three days. Both know that the young man's life will be forfeit if they are captured. They approach a boatman to whom the young man offers money if he will row them over the ferry; that is, if he will take them across Lochgyle. The boatman, a \"hardy Highland wight,\" agrees to row them across in spite of the raging storm, not for money, but for the sake of the \"winsome lady.\" As the pursuers approach, the boat puts out into the stormy loch. When Lord Ullin reaches the shore, he is forced to watch his daughter and her lover drown as he calls out to them, vainly promising forgiveness to the young man if only they will return.",
