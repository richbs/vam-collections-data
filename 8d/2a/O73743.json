The design, <font -i>Gendarme et Voleur</font -i> is based on the Guignol or Punch and Judy show. The policeman, recognisable by his large moustache and hat, and the thief by his knife are linked with elongated double rings all of gilded bronze. Over the centre pair of double rings run two dogs, as if chasing the thief, and the idea of the chase is reinforced by the extended arms and legs of the figures and the stretched appearance of the linking rings.",

It shows a policeman, with a large moustache and helmet, chasing a thief, shown with a knife. The idea of the chase is emphasized by the two dogs leaping over the centre rings and the extended limbs of the figures. \n\nLine Vautrin was a major figure in the Paris fashion world by the 1940s. She began making costume jewellery at the age of thirteen at her father's ironmongery business. Her first job was with the fashion designer Elsa Schiaparelli, but this remained a short interlude. By 1933 she decided to become independent and began to make jewellery mainly of gilded-bronze. Her career took off in 1937 at the \u2018L\u2019Exposition universelle\u2019 in Paris, and thereafter Vautrin opened a succession of boutiques. She was one of the first designers to make artistic jewellery in gilt metal. Vautrin also made buttons and boxes and, later, larger pieces in resin. Her bold and simple designs have a subtle wit and complex ideas just below the surface.\n\nThe lack of precious materials during the war time gave her the inspiration to use gilt-bronze for her jewellery collections. Later she included porcelain, ivory and mother-of-pearl to her range of materials. Buttons, brooches, buckles, necklaces, boxes and accessories of all sorts were part of her repertoire. Vautrin\u2019s designs are bold and sculptural, and her ideas have an element of wit and imagination.",

One of the first designers to make artistic jewellery in gilt metal, she also made buttons and boxes, and later, larger pieces in resin. Her designs appear bold and simple, with a subtle wit and complex ideas just below the surface. Her identity as a designer was always maintained as she not only designed but also ran a small traditional workshop in the Marais and had her own shop first near the Champs Elys\u00e9es and later at 63 Faubourg Saint Honor\u00e9.",
