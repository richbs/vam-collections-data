The landscape setting of this print is inspired by D\u00fcrer's travels through the Alps and his watercolour studies of quarries and cliffs around Nuremberg in about 1495. These studies are the earliest pure landscape studies to survive in Western art. \n\nD\u00fcrer produced six prints of St Jerome during his career, including his first signed wood block. He also used the subject St Jerome in a landscape for a small devotional panel painting now in the National Gallery, London. D\u00fcrer's interest in St Jerome reflects the increasing veneration which was given to the Church Fathers during the 15th century.For northern artists it was more usual to depict St. Jerome in his cell working on his translation of the bible. St Jerome in Penitence is thought to have been introduced into Italian art from about 1400 and D\u00fcrer may have seen examples of it on his travels to Italy.",
