Piper's set was a makeshift affair, painted on the back wall of the stage, with a set made out of abandoned objects, but it was in tune with the spirit of the production and led to a friendship between John Piper and John Cranko which resulted in several collaborations, including  in 1955 another abstract setting that Piper provided for Cranks, the John Cranko ballet entertainment originally staged at the New Watergate Theatre with a cast of four - Gordon Heath, Marcia Ashton, Anthony Newley, and Gilbert Vernon.  Because there was no financial backing for the production, all the people involved gave their services free, but it became an immediate success and  transferred to the St. Martins Theatre in 1956, when Annie Ross joined the cast, and later to the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith.",
