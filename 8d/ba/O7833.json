The great hall was the usual setting for such displays, since it was here that the medieval lord feasted with his household and guests. These eye-catching decorations not only advertised his wealth, but also proclaimed his family and social alliances.\n\nPlace\nThis is one of a series of coats of arms relating to the Beaupr\u00e9 family history. It is thought to have been commissioned for the ancestral home near Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, by Sir Robert Bell who married Dorothy Beaupr\u00e9, sole heiress of the family line, in 1559. Bell succeeded to the Beaupr\u00e9 estate after the death of Dorothy's father in 1567. The windows seem to date from the completion of a new great hall shortly afterwards, but were later moved and cut down to fit narrower window openings.\n\nPeople\nThis shield shows the arms of John Beaupr\u00e9, who had married Katherine Mountford in the early 14th century. The arms on the right indicate this alliance with the Mountford family. The two left quarters evoke John's descent from the St-Omers,  a Norman family who settled in Cambridgeshire during the 13th century. His mother, Christian, was the last female heir of this line when she married into the Beaupr\u00e9s. \n\nHeraldry\nThough a man's coat of arms was 'impaled' with those of his wife for the duration of the marriage, only his arms were traditionally passed on to children of the union. A woman's arms were only permanently incorporated into the family's heraldry if she was the sole heiress of her line.",
