In this case, the motif of a separate straight handle attached by bridging struts to the body of a vessel (a common feature in Dresser's designs for metalwork) has become the overall governing principle of the design. This gives the impression of an almost modular object constructed from simple elements.\n\nDesign & Designing\nDresser's most innovative designs were for objects to be made in metal. Variations on this design incorporate shorter bases (of sheet metal in contrast to the open frame here) with radiating (rather than parallel) uprights.  The design of this toast rack was registered by Hukin and Heath in May 1881 under the Designs Act (no. 2554).\n\nPeople\nChristopher Dresser is often regarded as the 'father of industrial design,' designing utilitarian objects for the general public while making full use of the latest mass production techniques.  He was receptive to a wide range of influences, particularly from botanical sources and Japanese decorative art.  Most of his truly radical designs for silver and electroplate followed his journey to Japan in 1876-1877, during which he exchanged contemporary British products for examples of Japanese work.",
