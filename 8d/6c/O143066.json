The photograph is thus a record of the work done and comes from an archive of designs and photographs from the firm.\n\nNow little known, Skidmore was once famous as the maker of the Albert Memorial (1863-1876) and the Hereford Screen (which was exhibited in London at the International Exhibition of 1862). Sir George Gilbert Scott (1811-1878) designed both the memorial and the screen and employed Skidmore to execute them. Skidmore also produced church plate, light fittings, and furniture but was best known for his innovative architectural ironwork such as this gate. Based in Coventry, Skidmore worked for some of the leading designers of the Gothic Revival movement, particularly Sir George Gilbert Scott.",

There are, however, some printed designs for gates in a private collection which are from a later date than the ones in Coventry because they are lettered 'BIRMINGHAM' as below. In 1872 Skidmore's Art Manufactures and Constructive Ironwork Company went into liquidation and was taken over by Winfields of Birmingham. The page of designs in the private collection is lettered 'EXTERIOR RAILING, and GATES. balconies & c.'  and 'F:A:SKIDMORE: COVENTRY and 24 HUNTERS Rd BIRMINGHAM.'   As this photograph is not lettered 'BIRMINGHAM' which occurs on ironwork photographed in that firm (see E.426-2006) then this gate may predate the move to Birmingham in 1872.",
