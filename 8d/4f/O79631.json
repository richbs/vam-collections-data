In the Syrian region, which incorporated much of Palestine, Jordan and Lebanon as well as Syria itself in the 19th century, they were worn by all sections of society, from townswomen to the nomadic Bedouin of the desert.  The designs vary by sector and show influences from a wide area, reflecting Syria\u2019s strong trading traditions and central location.\n\nDelicate bracelets of interlocking wire, like this one, were mainly worn by women in the rich cities.  The same sophisticated workmanship was used for making belts throughout the Ottoman Empire and continued in use in such places as Damascus until well into the 20th century.  This bracelet is said to have come from Beirut.",
