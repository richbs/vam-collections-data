Previously, the majority of women's shoes had much higher heels, fastened with buckles, and were often made of fabric.\n\nBoth shoes are the cut in exactly the same shape, a practice that had been constant since the introduction of heels in about 1600. With a return to flat shoes from the 1790s, the most important technical innovation was the re-introduction of rights and lefts which were a mirror image of each other. Women were slower to adopt them than men.(Swann) \n\n<i>Bibliography</i> \nGiorgio Riello, <i>A Foot in the Past.
