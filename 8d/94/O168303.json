The ensemble origins in two designs for compound-moulded plywood armchairs designed by Saarinen with Charles Eames for the Museum of Modern Art's 1940 competition, 'Organic Design in Home Furnishings'.  The pair won the competition, but the outbreak of war prevented manufacture. Eames and Saarinen left the Cranbook Academy of Art in Michigan, where they both taught, to work on war-related projects; Saarinen joined the US Government intelligence service, the OSS (Office of Strategic Services). While working for the OSS Saarinen is said to have continued designing furniture.  By 1946 Knoll Associates Inc., a New York firm founded by Hans and Florence Knoll, produced a Saarinen design, model 61W, which became known as the 'Grasshopper' chair, made from plywood and surplus parachute webbing.  Florence Knoll had been a student and friend of Saarinen's at Cranbrook and it was she who suggested that Saarinen develop further a large, lounge chair which existed in model form by 1945.  The design was achieved by 1946 though it was apparently not before at least 1948 that the chair and ottoman was manufactured by Knoll as model 70, the 'Womb' chair. \nThis example, together with the chair (W.35-2008) belonged to the American artist and designer Claire Falkenstein (1908-1997) and was purchased privately from an auction house which sold many of her possessions.  Although the auction house claimed the ensemble of chair and ottoman was manufactured during the 1950s which is plausible for the evident age, Falkenstein lived in Paris and in Venice before moving back to Venice, California in 1960.  It would seem logical that the ensemble was purchased then, although further research is required.\n\nHistorical significance: Eero Saarinen's 'Womb' chair  is an example of the post-War interest in organic and specifically womb-like design. It is an object frequently shown in touring exhibitions organized by the U.S. government during the 1950s.  These exhibitions were part of the American government's attempt to fight the Cold War by portraying the U.S. as 'a highly seductive model of a modern consumer society' (Cold War Modern, p. 82).",
