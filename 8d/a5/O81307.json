The fretwork in the back is copied directly from a design for a \u2018Chinese chair\u2019 by Thomas Chippendale, published in his Gentleman and Cabinet-Maker\u2019s Director in 1754. The fretwork on the legs and seat rails, however, is in the fanciful gothic style popularized by the collector Horace Walpole at his villa, Strawberry Hill, at Twickenham, near London.\n\nThe Chinese style was favoured especially in dressing rooms, which might typically be hung with (genuine) Chinese wallpaper. However, this chair is unlikely to have come from a dressing room, as it originally formed one of a set of at least sixteen chairs. The set may have been used as dining chairs, or perhaps in a large reception room such as a gallery.",
