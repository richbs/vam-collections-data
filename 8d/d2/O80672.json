Studied with BR Haydon, entered the RA Schools 1817 (at the age of 14); won annual prizes of the Royal Society of Arts 1813-17. A precocious and prodigious talent, as both painter and draughtsman, he exhibited - in a long and distinguished career - 179 works at the RA between 1815 and 1873, 94 at the BI 1818-65, and four at the SBA 1826-32. \nSubjects included portraits, but predominantly dealt with animal and human genre, often based in Scotland. Elected ARA 1826 (at the earliest permitted age), RA 1831. Received the patronage of the Russell family, and - most importantly- that of the Royal family, to whom he was Drawing Master, beginning in 1836 with the Duchess of Kent (Queen Victoria's mother); most significantly, he represented in visual form the Queen and Prince Albert's love for the life and landscape of the Scottish Highlands. Together with George IV's celebrated visit to Edinburgh 1822, and the great popularity of Sir Waiter Scott's Waverley novels, Landseer's contribution to the place of Scotland in European culture in the 19th century was considerable. The artist's own popularity was increased by the great number of reproductive prints after his works (Graves alone lists 434 by 126 engravers, see Lit below); his 'Monarch of the Glen' (exh, RA 1851), commissioned by the House of Lords but the cost refused by the House of Commons, was eventually bought by Sir Thomas Dewar and reproduced on his family firm's whisky bottle labels. Also significant was his anthropomorphic treatment of animals, particularly dogs; the <u>Art Journal</u> obituarist stressed that 'his dogs are not mere portraits only, they are thinking, almost rational, creatures, wanting only the gift of speech to hold converse with us'. Knighted 1850; offered PRA 1865, but refused, almost certainly because of his poor physical and mental health. Died London 1 October 1873; buried in St Paul's Cathedral. His studio sale was at Christie's 8-15 May 1874; a commemorative exhibition was held at the RA 1874/5. After the Royal Collection, the V&A possesses the largest holding of Landseer's works; there are a great many drawings and prints as well as the oils catalogued below, principally from the Sheepshanks Gift, one of the artist's most important patrons. \n\nLIT: F G Stephens <u>The Early Works of Sir Edwin Landseer RA</u> 1869; J Dafforne <u>Pictures by Sir Edwin Landseer </u>... 1873; <u>Art Journal </u>1873, p326 (obit); interleaved copy of 1874 RA exhibition catalogue, annotated by C S Mann, with photographs of prints after Landseer, 1874-7,4 vols (National Art Library, V&A); A Graves <u>Catalogue of the Works of the Late Sir Edwin Landseer</u> 1876; C Monkhouse entry in DNB; C Lennie Landseer: Victorian Paragon 1976; R Ormond <u>Sir Edwin Landseer</u> Philadelphia Museum of Art and Tate Gallery exhibition catalogue 1981 (With full bibliography).\n\n\n\nThere's no Place like Home FA91 Neg V1931 \nCanvas, 63.2 X 75.6 cm (24 7/8 X 29 3/4 ins) Sheepshanks Gift 1857 \nExhibited at the Br in 1842. The Art Union greatly admired it: \nThis is a contritely repentant absentee in the shape of a little rough terrier, that has evidently been sometime astray. His home is humble enough [referring of course to the full quotation from the famous ballad: 'Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home']: a barrel with a hole in it, his dish is empty and broken, and an intrusive snail has written 'solitude' at his very threshold. It is difficult to describe in words the profoundly imploring expression with which the eyes are endowed; the head is raised, and he looks upwards, as in the act of howling. Much of the picture seems to have been painted at once; it has all the clear colouring of the best style of its distinguished author; and of scarcely sufficient to sustain his great and universal reputation, it would make a character for any other living painter. \nIt may also be seen as an appropriate, canine comment on the so-called 'hungry forties' in Britain. \nEXH: \tBI 1842 (120); Victorian Narrative Paintings V&A circulating exhibition 1961; Victorian Painting Mitsukoshi Gallery, Tokyo, 1967 The Revolt of the Pre-Raphaelites Lowe Art Museum, University of Miami, Florida, 1972; Victorian Narrative Painting Bristol Cathedral 1977 \nENGR: \tBP Gibbon 1843 for Art Union 1844, p72, (Graves no 309, repr The Landseer Gallery 1871, pl 5); W T Davey; Alfred Lucas; [ames Scott 1883, as pl 72 of Works of Sir Edwin Landseer RA (first series 1881-93) \nLIT: \tArt Union 1842, p59, 1844, p72; Dafforne, p21; T H Ward English Art in the Public Galleries of London II, nd [1888], p166; J Manson Sir Edwin Landseer 1902, p119 \n\nRonald Parkinson\"\nDiana Donald and Jane Munro, ed. <u>Endless Forms.
