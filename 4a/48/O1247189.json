Mrs Stratton whose London premises were located at 104, Piccadilly, was commissioned to make the Princess's bridal dress and several other garments for her trousseau. This was a very prestigious commission which confirmed her position as one of London's leading court dressmakers.\n\nPrincess Beatrice (1857-1944) was Queen Victoria's youngest daughter. She married Prince Henry of Battenberg (1858-1896)  on 23 July 1885 at Whippingham Church, Osborne, in the Isle of Wight.",

The cuttings were preserved, and presumably taken, by Mrs Caroline Augusta Gammack (1852-1916) who worked as a stock keeper for Mrs Stratton. The garment for which this fabric was used has not been identified in contemporary news reports about the Princess's trousseau.",
