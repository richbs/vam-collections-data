She has been making street art since the early 1980s. Although she now sells her works as prints, and exhibits in commercial galleries, she continues to work in the urban environment at night. This particular image can also be seen sprayed onto dilapidated walls in Paris. \n\nThis print shows a female figure, although conventionally attractive in a revealing dress she is gazing directly at the viewer, refusing to be objectified. The slogan next to her can be translated as \u2018we are all in an irregular situation\u2019. Miss Tic\u2019s feminine characters, based on herself, and her sometimes confessional phrases, make her an interesting exception in the male-dominated street art genre. Miss Tic\u2019s work, although often very personal, also touches on feminist and political themes.",
