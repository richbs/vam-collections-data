Rupert Williamson had trained as a designer at the Royal College of Art, but had to learn his skills as a craftsman afterwards, working for a business that made reproduction antiques. Working alone he could only make four chairs in seven weeks, so they were inevitably expensive. In 1976 he showed this and three other chairs at an exhibition at the Royal College of Art, and was received with critical acclaim. \n\nThis extremely refined chair makes reference to several unconnected historic styles. In an interview Williamson admitted he was influenced by Art Deco and Celtic design, which is apparent in the knot formation in the chair back. He also admired the Biedermeier furniture from early 19th-century central Europe, which was characterised by clean lines and pale woods like this. Though Williamson did not acknowledge it, the subtle curve of the back also recalls early 18th-century English 'bended-back' chairs, themselves influenced by the shapes of traditional Chinese furniture.",
