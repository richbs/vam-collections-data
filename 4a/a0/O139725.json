The plaster figures were electroformed in copper by the firm of Francis Skidmore (1817-1896) known as Skidmore's Art Manufactures and Constructive Iron Company at Alma Street, Coventry. Then the figures were gilded in situ once mounted on the spire. The Albert Memorial, Hyde Park, London, was completed in 1874, to commemorate Prince Albert.
