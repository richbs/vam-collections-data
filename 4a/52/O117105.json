The jugs were originally designed by the Burslem pottery firm Shorter & Sons in 1940 when principals from the D'Oyly Carte Company were photographed in their costumes and in poses they felt best represented their characters. This was modelled on Ella Halman, as singer with the D'Oyly Carte between 1937-1951, as Katisha in The Mikado.\n\nTwo sizes of these jugs were made, as well as wall plaques, cigarette boxes and ash trays featuring the characters. As Art Director of Shorter's, Clarice Cliff was responsible for the design of the series although the figures were modelled by various artists: Betty Silvester modelled the Duchess. The outbreak of World War II meant that the range was not marketed until 1949 when an extensive advertising campaign in North America was master-minded by Colley Shorter. The set to which this jug belongs was the first of a very few produced in the mid-1980s by the owner of the original moulds who marked the jugs 'Rockingham'.",

            "history_note": "All the fourteen glazed earthenware figurines in this gift represent popular characters in Gilbert and Sullivan operas as they appeared with the D'Oyly Carte Company in the late 1940s.\n\nThis set was produced by Rockingham Pottery in 1985 from the original moulds used by Shorters in 1949 when they extended the concept of making  character jugs to issuing a set of entirely original figurines based on actors in costume.  They obtained permission from the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company to model fourteen character jugs from five of the G&S operas - <i>The Mikado, The Gondoliers, H.M.S. Pinafore, The Pirates of Penzance</i> and <i>The Yeomen of the Guard</i>. This series was quite different in style from any Shorter character jugs manufactured previously since the characters were posed and caught in mid-gesture, each wearing an exact copy of their stage costume.\n\nClarice Cliff, as Art Director, was apparently originally responsible for the design of the Gilbert and Sullivan series which was modelled by Betty Silvester. Although designed in about 1940 the Gilbert and Sullivan figures were not marketed until after the war when an extensive marketing campaign was master-minded by Colley Shorter in 1949.  They featured prominently when he and Clarice Cliff-Shorter toured Canada and the United Stated on a publicity tour in the same year.\n\nThe Gilbert and Sullivan character jugs were made in two sizes, large 10 inches high and small, 5 inches.   In addition to the figurines, small rectangular wall plaques, cigarette boxes and ash trays bearing embossed figures from the operas, supplemented the range.\n\nThis set of figurines is one of a very few sets impressed 'Rockingham', which were issued in the mid 1980s by the person who owned the moulds for a short period.",
