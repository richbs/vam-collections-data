It was registered in the London street directories at 77, South Audley Street, London W1 for the years 1948-1949. On the back of the dress, there is a prominent ribbon tied. The front of the skirt, the band, and the lower part of the ribbon are in the colour navy , while the bodice, the back of the dress, and the upper part of the ribbon are in white. On the band, a brooch made of diamond and rubies, is fastened. To the right, a smaller drawing shows the front of the dress. At top right, the designer noted, in pencil, the fabric, which is faille, a plain-woven textile characterised by slight, flat ribs in the weft, and the colours out of which the dress was intended to be made and special features of the design. \n\nThis design was in a folder marked 'Marjorie Field Rhoades' and 'Matita'. There are advertisements for the Matita label in the following editions of Vogue: Vogue, June, 1941, p.13, a photographic advertisement in Vogue, January, 1948, p.2, Vogue, March, 1948, p.34, Vogue, May, 1948, p.3. and Vogue, November, 1948, p.39.",
