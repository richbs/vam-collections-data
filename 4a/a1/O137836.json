This image depicts a field of boulders in the foreground, leading to a dramatically-lit view of Mount Williamson.  Adams wrote of the process of taking this photograph: \"I drove my station wagon to a place I had often visited.  Never before had the conditions been right for me at this location, but this time there was a glorious storm going on in the mountains\" (See Examples: The Making of 40 Photographs, p. 68).  Adams travelled throughout the West Coast of the United States during his career, producing many powerful landscape photographs.",
