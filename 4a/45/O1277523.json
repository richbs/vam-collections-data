The first actor to be knighted, Irving established a leading role for both himself, and his theatre during the late nineteenth century. Under his management the Lyceum theatre became famous for the quality and scale of its spectacular productions. \n\nEdward Gordon Craig was the son of Irving's leading lady, Ellen Terry (1847-1928) who performed alongside Irving for over twenty years.",
