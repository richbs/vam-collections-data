It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years. Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn\u2019t needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nIt was the actor Matheson Lang who suggested that Gilbert Sommerlad compile albums of his caricatures. Matheson Lang was a link with Victorian theatre, having acted with Sir Frank Benson, Lillie Langtry and Ellen Terry. His character Wu Li Chang, depicted here, was one of his most successful roles which he originally played in London in 1913. This revival opened in Brighton on 25 January 1932 for a week of a tour. A local reviewer noted of Lang's performance: 'the distinguished actor's portrait of the Chinese gentleman is a masterpiece of bland dignity veiling a deadly purpose.'",
