Most theatres in the 19th century would have had some made to mark grand openings or milestone performances. By the end of the First World War however the practice had generally died out, only being revived very occasionally,  more often at London's opera houses than any other theatres.\n\nThis silk playbill was produced to mark the 2,239th performance of The Mousetrap on 12 April 1958, five and a half years into its run. A cream silk programme had been produced on 22 April 1955 to mark its 1,000 performances, but although both occasions were seen as important then, no-one would have imagined that the production would still be running over half a century later.",
