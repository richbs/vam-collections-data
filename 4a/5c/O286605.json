The silk has been made up from the panels of a skirt and is woven to shape with an edging and flounce and a lighter floral design above.\nThere are 2 comber repeats in the width of the textile.<u>\n</u>Satin of 5 ground, no separate binding warp. The weft is bound by the d\u00e9coupures (5 or 6 threads). There are two ground shoots to two of metal thread. On the unfaded back of the textile, it can be seen that the lower border is silver and the rest of the design is silver-gilt. Both are wound on silk core.\nThe join in the design between the flounce and the rest of the skirt is clearly visible. The silk is sewn together from pieces and lined with a light grey silk which may not be original. A border of gold braid has been added, probably in the 19<sup>th</sup> century.",
