It was thought to have been sold to the publisher for \u00a360 on Oliver Goldsmith\u2019s behalf by Dr Johnson to enable Goldsmith to pay off outstanding rent and to release himself from his landlady\u2019s arrest. It is the story of the family of Dr Primrose, a benevolent vicar, and follows them through their fall from fortune and their ultimate rise again. The story provides insight into family life and circumstances in the mid 18th century and the plot has many aspects of a pantomime like quality including impersonation, deception, an aristocratic villain and the abduction of a beautiful heroine.",
