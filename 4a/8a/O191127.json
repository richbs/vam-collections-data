As the successor to the Hungarian Socialist Workers\u2019 Party that had ruled the country during the communist era, the Hungarian Socialist Party could not refer to a glorious past.  Its politicians had lost all respect and socialist ideology had become degraded. The tactics in the electoral campaign were chosen accordingly. Either the professional competence or young age of the candidates was stressed. \n\nIn this case, the attention of the viewer is focussed immediately on an informal photograph of a young, attractive face.  The asymmetry of the composition and the jaunty positioning of the text \u2018our candidate\u2019 create a kind of calculated spontaneity. \n\nAn important element in the poster is the newly designed Socialist Party logo based on the motif of a red carnation.  The logo designer, Bea Farkas, constructed the carnation from the elements of a five-pointed communist red star, while also incorporating the Hungarian national colours (red, white and green).",
