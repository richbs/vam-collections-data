Most theatres and some circuses in the 19th century had some made to mark grand openings or milestone performances. By the end of the First World War however the practice had generally died out, only being revived very occasionally, more often at London's opera houses than any other theatres.\n\nHarmston's Circus travelled to Bombay from Madras and performed in Bombay from the 19th January to the 13th February 1906. This was produced as a souvenir of their performance on the 26th January because of the presence of Lord Lamington. The Baron Charles Wallace Alexander Napier Ross Cochrane-Baillie Lamington (1860-1940), previously a Member of Parliament in the UK and the Governor of Queensland, Australia, was Governor of Bombay from 1903 until 1907.\n\nHarmston's Circus was founded by the equestrian William Batty Harmston (1844-1893), born in Nottingham. After working with Chiarini's circus in India in 1887, he formed his own circus which toured Australia 1890-1891. After his death in Singapore, his widow carried on the circus with the manager Robert Love, who she married and whose surname can be seen on this programme added to her name and that of her children.",
