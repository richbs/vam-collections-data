Upper: incomplete but evidence of 2 cms plain weave with 9 passes of white cotton and then the remainder with white wool; there is soumak at the lower end and a fringe with a max. of 8 rows of off-set knotting.\n\nDESIGN: Field: dark blue ground heavily decorated with six angular medallions along the central axis; 5 are framed with a white greek key pattern on black (the diagonals become zigzags) and the 6th (which is third from the lower end and larger than the others) is outlined in red and white blocks.   Among the many motifs scattered across the ground are animals (inc. camels) and a pair of seated figures at the top which are reminiscent of Persian paintings; there are also three other pairs of stylised human figures and rosettes and geometric motifs.  There is a band across the very top of alternating chequered octagons and rosettes.\n\nMain border: white ground with horned rectangles containing mainly rosettes or octagons.\n\nInner border: reciprocal diamond heads in dark green (faded to bue)/red.\n\nOuter border: reciprocal diamond heads in blue/red.",
