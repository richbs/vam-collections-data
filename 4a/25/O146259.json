The understudy is an actor who learns the part of a leading character in a play, in order to take over should the lead be unable to appear on stage. This kind of opportunity has often advanced actors to stardom in showbusiness, and hence the depiction of the actress in this woodcut as being apprehensive. \n\nPeter Bax, the designer of this woodcut print, worked as an assistant stage manager at Drury Lane Theatre from 1924. Working behind-the-scenes, he would have experienced the tension of the understudy first-hand. After later working on the first BBC television transmissions, in 1934, he further honed his aptitude for scenic design at Alexander Palace theatre.",
