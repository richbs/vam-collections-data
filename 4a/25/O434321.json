The high-ceilinged room has a ceiling fan and high, curtained windows open onto a courtyard with palm trees. The walls are painted cream (above) and green (below). The floor is covered by rugs. The settee and armchairs are covered in mauve material with a green edging. Examples of Indian and Tibetan artefacts in the room include two thangkas, a stringed instrument, a brass bucket and items of Bengali folk art, but the painting is too impressionistic for the detail to be discernible. Percy Brown, the author of standard works on Indian painting and architecture, was Curator of the Arts Section of the Calcutta Museum.",
