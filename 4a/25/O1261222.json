It has one ear vertically upright, and one folded down, giving the dog a distinctive look.  \nSteiff was founded in 1880 by Margarete Steiff, who designed the prototypes herself. However, it did not initially make teddy bears, something it began in 1902, and is now world famous for. The company remains popular to this day and its soft toys are known for their high quality.",
