They were modelled on existing figures known to Chinese potters, such as deities and mythical animals, or copied from European models introduced by supercargoes. \n\nThis figure probably represents one of the hehe erxian or Daoist twins immortals, symbols of harmony in Chinese folk religion. Identical figures were found in the cargo of the Geldermalrsen,  a Dutch East India Company vessel that sank in Indonesian waters in 1752. As no mention was made to figures in the Dutch order, it is likely that they were privately purchased. \n\nFigures of several kinds were used as decorative pieces  in the residences of European aristocrats and wealthy people, where they were often put on display in the so-called 'porcelain rooms'. One of the largest collection of Chinese porcelain known in Europe belonged to August the Strong of Saxony (d. 1733), who owned more than 21,000 pieces.",
