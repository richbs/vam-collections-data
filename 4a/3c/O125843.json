(some col.).\nExhibition catalogue\n<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, p. 80-90\nThe following is an extract from the text of the entry:\n\nThe sketch-book half-bound in black leather, gold-tooled, marbled boards.  \nThe intercalated leaf on laid paper of light green tinge with truncated watermark in cartouche.\nThe sketch-book was used in Essex and Suffolk between July and October 1813.  The inserted leaf is from a sketch-book of the year 1815, of which Nos. 140 [827-1888], 143 [232-1888], and 145 [828-1888] also formed a part.\nThere are drawings on 72 pages of the original book, and on each side of the inserted leaf, making 74 in all.  Pages bearing the inscriptions or scribbles without drawings are not reproduced amongst the plates.  Unless otherwise recorded, the inscriptions are evidently by the same artist.\n\np. 1:\nFaint scribble\np. 2:\nInscribed <i>6 feet 2 inches-by-7 feet 6 inches the extreme size of the compartment projecting over the fireplace-above the dado-in the Chapel</i> \np. 3:\nThe tomb of Viscountess Falkland in the churchyard at Widford, near Chelmsford, Essex. \nInscribed on the1eft vertically <i>Vist. Falkland Irish died 76 1762</i> [or <i>Ae. 62</i>]. This is a rough record of the inscription on the tomb which although now partly obliterated records that the Viscountess Falkland died on 27 May 1776, aged 62. \np. 4:\nBlank\np. 5:\nSt. Mary-ad-Murum Church, Colchester, seen from the garden of a house. \np. 6:\nInscribed <i>Colchester</i>, in reference to p. 5: the inscription probably not written by the artist. \np. 7:\nThree drawings on one page. Adonkeystanding,facing the spectator, by a fence. A donkey standing sideways to the spectator, facing left up a hill: behind him is a short hedge. A much rubbed indistinct drawing of a barge (with sail arm visible) in a pool with a cottage on the right, and vague indications of trees in the left background. \np. 8 \nA pool on a river (presumably the Stour) by moonlight; to the right the full moon shining over a squarish church tower is reflected in the water of the pool; to the left is a gable-ended cottage with a chimney in the centre of the roof. \np. 9 \nTwo drawings on one page. The tower of Stratford St. Marychurch seen over a group of gable-ended buildings amid trees; inscribed below <i>Stratford Hall Suffolk, a house formerly inhabited by one of Oliver Cromwell's Generals</i>. Mr. Norman Scarfe has communicated the information that Sergeant-Major-General Skippon bought Stratford Hall in 1657. A group of two cows, the foremost one standing to the left, the other lying half-hidden, head to the right. \np. 10 \nFlatford Mill seen over the Stour between trees, and on the left the end of Flatford Old Bridge. \nThe two trees on the right are those which occur in the right foreground of the oil painting 'Flatford Mill' (Tate Gallery No. 1273), and are also seen in the sketch-book No. 132 [1259-1888], p. 61 and in the drawing No. 161 [256-1888]. The mill buildings are seen at the same angle here as in the oil painting, which also shows the edge of the wooden bridge. \np. 11 \nTwo sketches on one page of men or boys propelling barges. One shows a boy propelling a barge with a pole, and the other, which is slighter, shows a man and a boy each with poles. The former probably served as the sketch for the detail of the boy and the foremost barge in the 'View on the Stour near Dedham' in the Huntington Library and Art Gallery, San Marino. \np. 12 \nTwo drawings on one page. A view over Dedham Vale; inscribed below on left <i>25 July-noon-Suffolk</i>. This has been identified by Opp\u00e9 (<i>Old Master Drawings</i>, Vol. XI, 1936-7, p. 55), as being connected with the sketch for the mezzotint 'A Summerland' (S. 10). The drawing contains the left-hand two-thirds of the mezzotinted design. The mezzotint is subtitled 'A view near East Bergholt' in Bohn's edition of <i>English Landscape Scenery</i>, 1855. The Glebe Farm, Langham, is above the poplar: the church tower of Stoke- by-Nay land beyond.  Also a slight sketch of a farm labourer seen from behind. \np. 13\nStoke-by-Nayland Church seen over cottages and trees; inscribed at top left <i>Stoke-by Neyland. Suffolk</i>. (See also pp. 15 and 17) \np. 14\nA mill or barn seen over water with trees on the right on near bank: inscribed below on left <i>July 10. 1813</i>. \np. 15\nStoke-by-Nayland Church seen over cottages and trees from a slightly different viewpoint from that in p. 13. (See also p. 17)\np. 16 \nTwo drawings on one page. The east end of East Bergholt Church. A view over rising ground to cottages on a ridge. \np. 17\nStoke-by-Nayland Church tower seen above trees, with a cottage on the left. (See also pp. 13 and 15)\np. 18 \nEast Bergholt: a street with trees and cottages on the left, and on the right the ruined tower of the church seen from the south. \np. 19\nEast Bergholt Church: the ruined tower seen from the north and, partially obscured, a cottage with two chinmeys; indistinctly inscribed below <i>July 20</i> [?].  If correctly read, the date is the same as that on p. 24, when Constable made another drawing of East Bergholt Church. \np. 20\nBlank.\np. 21\nAn extensive landscape, with a path through standing corn and a large Plate 79 tree on the left; inscribed in the top left corner <i>13 July. 1813.</i> The inscription on p. 22 doubtless refers to this drawing, identifying the scene as East Bergholt, in which case the trees and slopes in the distance are those of Dedham Vale. The group silhouetted against the sky, right, closely resembles that in the middle distance of 'Autunmal \nSunset' (No. 120 [127-1888]). \np. 22 \nInscribed on the left, presumably with reference to p. 21 <i>13. July. 1813. \nBergholt J.C.</i> \np.23 \t\nSketches of cows: three cows lying and one standing in a field; below, slight sketches of other cows. \np. 24 \nThe ruined tower of East Bergholt Church from the north, with a plate 80 cottage on the right; inscribed below on right <i>20 July.</i>\np. 25 \nThree sketches on one page. A thatched gable-ended cottage. An artist wearing a tall hat seated on a folding stool and drawing in a sketch-book. The porch of East Bergholt Church seen in profile from the west. \np. 26 \nPart of the north side of East Bergholt Church seen in a gap in trees: on the left a rainbow in a stormy sky; inscribed below <i>22. July- 1813-E Bergholt-</i>. \np.27 \nA barge passing under Flatford old bridge: on the left a gable-ended cottage with a thatched roof [Bridge Cottage] and on the right, beyond, another cottage. The cottage and bridge are also to be seen on pp. 29 and 53 of this sketch-book, on p. 52 of the sketch-book No. 132 [1259-1888], and in Nos. 297 [313-1888], 298 [244-1888] and 324 [243-1888]. \np. 28 \nA woman seated at a table writing, while a girl seen in profile stands watching her; inscribed in lower left corner <i>19. July. 1813.</i> The same date occurs on p. 34 on a drawing of Golding Constable's house. \np. 29\nA barge passing under Flatford old bridge, beyond which is Bridge Cottage. (See also pp. 27 and 53 of this sketch-book, p. 52 of the sketch-book  No. 132 [1259-1888], and in Nos. 297 [313-1888], 298 [244-1888] and 324 [243-1888].\np. 30 \nThree sketches on one page. Looking up sloping and undulating country towards a ridge with trees and a long low building (probably, from its resemblance to pp. 34 and 37, Golding Constable's house at East Bergholt). A slight sketch of trees in front of a ridge. An indefinite scribble, somewhat geometrical and partly resembling a face. \np. 31 \nTwo sketches on one page. Willy Lott's house seen from the river Stour. Constable used this in composing 'The Valley Farm' (L. ed. M., p. 420) (see note following No. 374 [140-1888]); the sketch on p. 70 appears to be related to the composition. To the left of this, and slightly over-lapping it, is a more elaborated but small sketch of undulating ground, with a gate-post prominent in the foreground and a single tree beyond by the bend of a river. \np. 32 \nThree sketches on one page. A wide view over a valley under a cloudy sky, with two figures in the foreground; inscribed below <i>24th July. 1813.</i> A sketch of a cottage or house, on the left of which is a dark shadowy group of trees. A small sketch of a donkey craning upwards to eat from a hedge (see also the oil sketch No. 287 [790-1888] and the note on it). \np. 33 \nView over a wide landscape: a solitary figure in the left foreground and a square church tower in the middle distance. The scene is probably Dedham Vale taken from a viewpoint nearer the three poplar trees in Sir Richard Proby's oil painting 'Dedham Vale'. \np. 34 \nTwo drawings on one page. A lane at East Bergholt with Golding Constable's house on the right: the house is marked with a cross and the drawing inscribed below <i>19 July 1813 House in which I was born x</i> (see also pp. 30 and 37). A landscape, with a figure in the foreground, looking toward a long, low house, probably also Golding Constable's house; inscribed below <i>21</i> [altered from <i>19</i> and written twice] <i>July 1813.</i>\np.35 \nBlank. \np. 36 \nA landscape with Dedham Church in the distance, right, and a bird soaring in a cloudy sky; inscribed below <i>Dedham The Sky Lark</i>\np. 37 \nEast Bergholt: a lane, with Golding Constable's house and other houses and cottages on the left, seen from a similar viewpoint to that in p. 34; inscribed at top left <i>23</i> [, <i>23rd</i>]. \np.38 \nBlank. \np. 39 \nDedham Vale, with the tower of the church in the distance; inscribed below on left <i>Dedham from Langham</i>\nFor the relation of this drawing, and those on pp. 51 and 52, to the mezzotint 'Summer Morning: Dedham from Langham' see the note on the oil sketch No. 332 [132-1888]. \np.40 \nBlank. \np. 41 \nThree sketches on one page. View up a slope on which is a flock of cattle or sheep; inscribed below on right <i>27 July-1813 Eving-</i>(the same date as that on p. 26, which was drawn upon at East Bergholt). \nA small sketch of a man with a horse and cart. A very faint sketch of a river winding between wooded banks. \np. 42 \nThe seashore, with boats moored near low cliffs; inscribed above <i>Mistley near Harwich</i> and below on left <i>30 July</i>. Wrabness Point is visible to the right of the masts. \np. 43 \nTwo sketches on one page. A wide view over Dedham Vale; inscribed <i>28 July. 1813. E[ast] B[ergholt].</i> Opp\u00e9 (<i>Old Master Drawings</i>, Vol. XI, 1936-7, p. 55) says this is a repetition of p. 12 and is also related to the mezzotint 'A Summerland': he gives the date as 28 August; the drawing appears, however, to give a different view of Dedham Vale. A very slight and indistinct sketch, possibly of a church tower amid trees. \np. 44 \nTwo sketches on one page. A gable-ended cottage at East Bergholt, to the left of a wood, behind a clearing, with the sun setting above the trees; inscribed below <i>Augst 12. E[ast] B[ergholt] Twylight</i>. A clump of trees, seen in a similar light. \np. 45 \t\nEast Bergholt Church: the ruined tower and west end of the church on the right, seen from the village street, with trees on the left and a gable-ended cottage beyond; inscribed below on left <i>E Bergholt Church</i>. \np. 46\nFour sketches on one page. A view over a wide landscape with cows under the shade of a tree in the left foreground, and a squarish church tower in the distance. A road, leading towards a gable-ended cottage and trees, with a figure walking along it. A man carrying a scythe, seen from behind. A similar figure is seen in the middle distance, right, \nof 'Flatford Mill' (Tate Gallery). A sketch of two men in tall hats. \np. 47 \t\nThree sketches on one page. A close-up view of a rope amid stones and rocks on a seashore. A seashore or estuary scene: three boats on a shelving beach, and on the right a fisherman with a net going down to the water; inscribed below on right <i>30 July- </i>(the same date as that on p. 42, when Constable was at Mistley, near Harwich). An indistinct small landscape with a windmill. \np. 48 \nThree sketches on one page. Open rolling landscape with a windmill in the distance. A wide landscape with the ground sloping toward a clump of trees on the right. A smaller sketch of a landscape with a group of trees on the right. \np. 49 \nThree sketches on one page. A view over two fields: two cows are in the nearer, which is closed by a five-barred gate at either end. A clump of trees with part of a cottage to the left, a man leaning on a fence in the foreground, and a crescent moon in the sky. A smaller sketch of a cottage amid trees. \np. 50 \nTwo sketches on one page. A road bending to the right past trees to some cottages on a lower level. A road running past East Bergholt Church, seen on the left; inscribed vertically on left <i>7 Augst 1813.</i>\np. 51 \nFive sketches on one page. A small landscape under an overcast sky, with a squarish church tower silhouetted in the distance. A larger slight sketch of Dedham Vale from Langham, with the tower of the church in the distance (see also pp. 39, 52 and No. 332 [132-1888]). The outline of the distance is faintly repeated above this sketch. Two slight \nsketches of a dog. \np. 52\nFour sketches on one page. Dedham from Langham (see also pp. 39, 52 and No. 332 [132-1888]). Three slight sketches of a man and horse ploughing (see also the drawings on pp. 71 and 72 connected with 'A Summerland'). \np. 53 \nA slight sketch, apparently of Bridge Cottage seen from Flatford old bridge (see also pp. 27 and 29 of this sketch-book, p. 52 of the sketchbook No. 132 [1259-1888], and Nos. 297 [313-1888], 298 [244-1888] and 324 [243-1888]).\np. 54 \nTwo drawings on one page. A scene on the Stour: a horse on the towpath drawing a barge through meadows; inscribed (in the sky of the second sketch) <i>Augst 11 1813.</i> A view over water towards barges by the lock at Flatford, with Bridge Cottage and trees beyond; inscribed below <i>Augt 12 1813</i> and <i>Lock</i>. \nThe latter drawing was made on the same day as that of East Bergholt on p. 44. \np. 55 \nTwo drawings on one page. A bank with two trees in the left foreground and a ploughed field beyond. A close-up view of waterlilies and reeds. Similar groups of water-lilies and reeds occur in the foregrounds of 'The White Horse' (Frick Collection, New York), 'Stratford Mill' (collection of Sir Reginald Macdonald-Buchanan) and 'View on the Stour near Dedham' (Huntington Library and Art Gallery, San Marino). \np. 56 \nEight studies on one page. Seven studies (some very faint) of cows, seen singly or in pairs; one is inscribed <i>22d Augt</i>. A woman and a man with a stave, seen from behind. \np. 57 \nTwo sketches on one page. View over meadows: in the foreground a woman is crossing a small footbridge over a ditch; inscribed below on left <i>14 Augst.1813</i>. A horse, cart and driver seen from behind: inscribed below <i>29th Sp.</i> [?]; if correctly read this drawing bears the same date as pp. 68, 69 and 83 which were made at Colchester. \np. 58 \nBlank. \np. 59 \nTwo sketches on one page. A gable-ended thatched cottage, on the right of a lane with trees behind; inscribed below on left <i>25 Augst1813.</i> The ruined tower of East Bergholt Church, seen from the northwest with the crocketed turret beyond; inscribed below on left <i>E[ast] B[ergholt]</i> or <i>26</i>[?]. \np. 60 \nBlank. \np. 61 \nThree sketches on one page. A view over a wide landscape, with a barn or cottage in the middle distance to left; inscribed above the sketch below, but probably in reference to this sketch <i>31. Augst. 1813</i>. A horse and cart, with a man standing beside the cart, and beyond on the left a man with a horse and foal. A flock of sheep lying in the shade of a tree of which only the trunk and lower foliage are seen. \np. 62 \nBlank. \np. 63 \nTwo sketches on one page. A view over a field to a group of cottages with a screen of trees behind them; inscribed below on right <i>Sept. 1 1813.</i> A view over a valley from rising ground: in the foreground a flock of sheep, with trees beyond and in the middle distance a church (? Dedham) with a squarish tower; inscribed below on right <i>Monday Evng. Sept. 5. 1813.</i> (In the year 1813, however, September 5th fell on a Sunday.) \np. 64 \nBlank. \np. 65 \nDedham Church, seen over a fence and a clump of trees; inscribed below on left <i>26 Sepr. 1813. Dedham</i> beneath some faintly legible writing, apparently to the same effect. \np. 66 \nColchester Castle, with trees and a cottage on the left and figures on a path in the foreground; inscribed below on left <i>Colchester Castle</i>. \np. 67 \nTwo drawings on one page. A cottage seen to the left of a path beside a tree and hedgerow, with indistinct figures. A view over water and rising ground to a tall mansion with a pitched roof, standing on a ridge. \np. 68 \nSt. Mary-ad-Murum Church, Colchester, seen across a street in which figures are standing, and behind and to the right of a group of cottages; inscribed below on the left <i>St. Mary's on the Walls Colchester 29 Sept. 1813</i>.\np. 69 \nTwo drawings on one page. Four horses working a threshing pit in a farmyard with a man with a whip controlling them; inscribed at top <i>Threshing and below 28 Sepr. 1813 </i>(the scene has been identified by Mr. Rudsdale of Scar borough Museum as a threshing pit between East Bergholt and Colchester). St. Mary-ad-Murum, Colchester, seen over buildings as in p. 5; inscribed below <i>29 Sepr. 1813. Colchester</i>. \np. 70 \nTwo sketches on one page. St. Mary-ad-Murum Church, Colchester, seen to the right of trees (the scene identified by Mr. Rudsdale of Scarborough Museum). A slight sketch of buildings (? Willy Lott's house) among trees. As far as can be seen, this is of the same type as the drawing on p. 31 and related to 'The Valley Farm' (see note following No. 374 [140-1888]). \np. 71 \nA man ploughing with two horses. This may be compared with the very similar sketches on pp. 52 and 72. This drawing was used as the sketch for the figures in the mezzotint 'A Summerland' (S. l0); the fuller title given to the mezzotint was 'Summerland. Rainy Day. The Ploughman' (S.: L., p. 230). \np. 72\nFive sketches on one page. The sun shining behind a large cloud formation seen above open country. A long narrow landscape with two horses, one standing and one lying, in a field to left, and to the right a windmill and cottages. Three sketches of a man ploughing, in two with horses and in one, alone. (See also the sketches on pp. 52 and \n71 connected with 'A Summerland'.) \np. 73 \nBlank. \np. 74 \nBlank. \np. 75 \nA cottage seen amid trees.\np. 76 \nA post made of three pieces of timber, on the bank of a stream (see also p. 77). \np. 77 \nTwo sketches on one page. A post similar to that on p. 76, but made of four pieces of timber. This was used as a sketch for the construction seen in the right foreground of 'Stratford Mill' (collection of Sir Reginald Macdonald-Buchanan). A mill seen across a pool; inscribed below <i>22 Ocr 1813 friday  The Martin Cats-Shot-by G.C.</i> The building seen in profile resembles Flatford Mill, but it is not clear that all the details (such as the fenestration and the outbuildings) support the identification. The event referred to in the inscription is connected with the painting' Martin Cats' which Constable exhibited as No. 216 at the British Institution in 1814. Of this he wrote to Maria Bicknell on 19 February 1814 \"When I told you I had sent nothing to the British Gallery I meant nothing new- I did not recollect the Cats which I painted just before I left Suffolk to please Golding who brought it (<i>sic</i>) from the woods at the back of the village\" (Beckett, H, p. 118). Golding Constable, the artist's elder brother, was a notable shot. \np. 78 \nView of St. Mary's, Church Street, Colchester, with the tower of St. Mary-ad-Murum Church beyond. St. Mary's was the residence of Constable's cousin, William Mason; it still stands, though the facade has been somewhat altered (information from Mr. E. O'R. Dickey and Mrs. Fell; see also Beckett, I, p. 277-8). \np. 79 \nBlank. \np. 80 \nScene in Colchester: in the foreground part of the old Roman wall (now destroyed) and, beyond, the church of St. James's. Inscribed below <i>19. Octr. East Hill. Colchester</i> and above the church <i>St. James\u2019s</i>. \np. 81 \nTwo sketches on one page. The gateway of St. John's Abbey, Colchester, seen at the end of a path; inscribed below <i>St. John Abbey gate Colchester</i>. A church tower on a ridge, seen across fields; inscribed <i>Octr. 18 1813. St. Mary's Colchester</i>. \np. 82 \nTwo sketches on one page. Colchester Castle with trees on the left and a church tower beyond; inscribed below on left <i>Ocr. 1. 1813. Colchester.</i> A slight sketch of a ridge on which are silhouetted a clump of trees, a church tower and a house; inscribed at top left <i>18 Octr. 1813.</i>\np. 83 \nA view of Colchester seen from the river Colne; inscribed below <i>29 Sepr. 1813</i> and <i>Colchester Castle from North Bridge</i>. \np. 84 \nBlank. \np. 85 \nThe village fair at East Bergholt: the village street with booths on either side and houses in the background; inscribed below on left <i>E.B. fair July 1813</i> (see also the oil sketch No. 101 [128-1888] of 1811, p. 87 of this sketch-book and No. 132 [1259-1888], p. 13).  For the reasons given in the note on No. 101 [128-1888], the sketch was made towards the end of July. \np. 86 \nBlank. \np. 87 \nA crowd of people watching a performance on a stage at a village fair: probably a scene at the East Bergholt July Fair (see also p. 85 of this sketch-book). \np. 88 \nTwo sketches on one page. An indistinct thumbnail sketch, perhaps of one or two barges passing trees or buildings. A man wearing a hat and bending forward. The page is inscribed vertically <i>Dec 1809 12 st 2 lbs.</i>, and with an illegible line above. \np. 89 \nThe tower of St. Mary-ad-Murum Church seen beyond buildings; inscribed below <i>St. Mary ad Murum-Colchester.</i> \np. 90 \nA faint sketch of a landscape: in the foreground a figure crossing a bridge over a stream; on the left, on the other bank of the stream, two or three trees and, beyond, a ridge rising to the right. \np. 91 \t\n(Intercalated leaf) Two sketches on one page. The tower of Stratford St. Mary Church, seen on the left of a tree. Two figures playing musical instruments: in front, a seated man playing a pipe and, behind, a violoncellist. \np. 92 \n(Intercalated leaf) A wide landscape: in the foreground a man ploughing with two horses down a sloping field, with indistinct figures on the right; inscribed at top left <i>19. Sept. 1815.</i> \npp. 91 and 92 are drawn on a leaf from a sketch-book of pages measuring 3 1/8 x 4 ins. (78 x 101 mm.) of 1815, of which other detached leaves are Nos. 140 [827-1888], 143 [232-1888] and 145 [828-1888].\n\n NOTE ON THE SKETCH-BOOK NO. 121 [317-1888]\n\nThis book represents the work of a long summer spent in sketching at East Bergholt. In a letter which Beckett (II, p. 120) dates in March 1814 Constable wrote to Maria Bicknell, doubtless referring to this sketch-book, \"You once talked to me about a journal. I have a little one that I made last summer that might amuse you could you see it- you will then see how I amused my leisure walks, picking up little scraps of trees, plants, ferns, distances &c &c.\" Most of the named or identifiable scenes are within easy reach of East Bergholt, though there are excursions to Chelmsford, Colchester and Mistley. It is probable that all the scenes in the book of a canalised river with barges are on the Stour (such as p. 54 top), and that many of the wide vistas of landscape are of Dedham Vale and its immediate vicinity. The sketch-book contains studies on pp. 12, 52, 71 and 72 connected with the design mezzotinted as 'A Summerland' (S. 10) and on pp. 39, 51 and 52 variant views of the composition known as 'Summer Morning: Dedham from Langham' (S. 26). It also contains sketches connected with 'The Valley Farm' (pp. 31 and 70), 'Flatford Mill' (pp. 10, 46), 'The White Horse' (p. 55), 'Stratford Mill' (pp. 55, 77) and 'View on the Stour near Dedham' (p. 55). \n\nThe dated pages in the sketch-book, with place-names where known, or with brief descriptions of subject, are: \n\nJuly 10: p. 14: A mill or barn.\nJuly 13: p. 21: East Bergholt \nJuly 19: pp. 28, 34: East Bergholt \nJuly 20: p. 24: East Bergholt\nJuly 20[?]: p. 19: East Bergholt \nJuly 21: p. 34: East Bergholt \nJuly 24: p. 32: A valley scene \nJuly 25: p. 12: Dedham Vale? \nJuly 27: p. 26: East Bergholt \nJuly 27: p. 41: A landscape with cattle \nJuly 28: p. 43: Dedham Vale \nJuly 30: pp. 42, 47: Mistley \nEnd of July: pp. 85, 87: The fair at East Bergholt.\nAugust 7: p. 50: East Bergholt \nAugust 11: p. 54: A scene on the Stour\nAugust 12: pp. 44, 54: East Bergholt; Flatford\nAugust 14: p. 57: A view over meadows \nAugust 22: p. 56: Studies of cows \nAugust 25: p. 59: A thatched cottage \nAugust 31: p. 61: A landscape with a cottage \nSeptember 1: p. 63: A field with cottages beyond.\nSeptember 5 or 6: p. 63: Dedham?\nSeptember 26: p. 65: Dedham\nSeptember 28: p. 69: Between East Berholt and Colchester \nSeptember 29: pp. 68, 69, 83: Colchester \nSeptember 29 [?]: p. 57: A horse and cart \nOctober 1: p. 82: Colchester\nOctober 18: pp. 81, 82: Colchester\nOctober 19: p. 80: Colchester \nOctober 22: p. 77: A mill",
