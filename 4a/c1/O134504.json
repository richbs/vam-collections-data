Before 1800</i>, London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, p. 56-63, cat. no. 60 (P.26-1938 - P.78-1938)\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"Luca CARLEVARIJS (1663-1730) \n<i>Venetian School</i>  \nBorn at Udine, he moved to Venice with his sister in 1679, and later visited Rome. He was influenced by Sebastiano Ricci (1659-1734). A mathematician and architect as well as a painter and engraver, he was the first Venetian to paint vedute (mainly for a foreign and diplomatic market), his predecessors having been foreigners such as Joseph Heintz (in Venice by 1625). There is no evidence for the view that Canaletto was taught by him, though Canaletto was plainly influenced by his works. His paintings are comparatively rare. \n\n60 \nFIFTY-THREE STUDIES \n<i>Canvas</i> \n(except where otherwise indicated) \n\nP.72-1938 A masked lady 6 3/4 x 3 5/8 (17.2 x 9.3)\nRizzi (1967): No.47, fig.44\n\nThese well-known sketches by Carlevarijs include figures which he used frequently and virtually without variations in his paintings between 1707 and 1726. In addition, some of the figures in his etchings of 1703, <i>Le fabriche e vedute di Venetia</i>, are related to them (Pope-Hennessy, 1938). He seems therefore to have used them during the greater part of his active life as a painter. They demonstrate his influence on Canaletto, whose figures and their arrangement in some of his early paintings show a marked debt to Carlevarijs, in, for example, <i>The Doge visiting the Church and Scuola di S. Rocco</i> of circa 1735 (London, N. G.) (Constable, 1962). \nAmong the figures which are used most often, P.68 appears in: <i>Piazza S. Marco con ciarlatini</i> (Berlin-Dahlem, Rizzi, 1967, pls. 104-07), <i>Piazza S. Marco with a market</i> (Rome, formerly Lazzaroni Collection; Rizzi, 1967, pls. 101-03), <i>Piazzetta seen from the Molo</i> (Milan, private collection; Rizzi, 1967, pl. 42), <i>Regatta on the Grand Canal</i> (Copenhagen, Frederiksberg Castle; Rizzi, 1967, pls. 35-7), <i>Piazzetta from the Sea</i> (formerly Munich, Collection Drey; Rizzi, 1964, pl. xxxii), <i>Molo with the Zecca</i> (Rome, Galleria Nazionale; Rizzi, 1967, pl. 57 f.), <i>Piazza</i> (Poznan; Mauroner, 1945, fig. 25). The left-hand figure of P.65 appears in, amongst other paintings: <i>The Duke of Manchester's Entry into the Doge's Palace</i> (Birmingham, City Art Gallery; Rizzi, 1967, pls, 28-30), and the other version of this subject (The Hague; Rizzi, 1967, pls. 31-4), <i>Piazza S. Marco</i> (Balcarres; Rizzi, 1967, pls, 96-9), <i>Piazza S. Marco</i> (Kiplin Hall; Rizzi, 1967, pl. 119 f.), <i>Il bucintoro in bacino S. Marco</i> (Rome, formerly Lazzaroni Collection; Rizzi, 1967, pls. 43-4), <i>Riva degli schiavoni</i> (Milan, Collection Fano; Rizzi, 1967, pls. 54-6), <i>Piazza S. Marco con ciarlatini</i> (Berlin Dahlem; Rizzi, 1967, pls, 104-07). P. 76 can be seen in: <i>Piazza S. Marco</i> (Kiplin Hall; Rizzi, 1967, pl. 119 f.), <i>The Duke of Manchester's Entry into the Doge's Palace</i> (The Hague; Rizzi, 1967, pls. 30-4), and <i>Piazzetta seen from the Malo</i> (Milan, private collection; Rizzi, 1967, pl. 42). P. 69 appears in the first two of those paintings, and P.72 in <i>Piazza S. Marco</i> (Hartford; Rizzi, 1967, pls, 115-16), and <i>Piazza S. Marco</i> (Kiplin Hall; Rizzi, 1967, pl. 119 f.). \nThe earliest dateable painting, <i>The Duke of Manchester's Entry into the Doge's Palace</i>, 1707 (Birmingham City Art Gallery) includes P.37, P.64, P.65 and P.69. Even more of the figures are used in <i>The Reception of Count Colloredo</i> (Dresden), dated by Rizzi to Colloredo's mission of 1726, rather than that of 1714: P.42, P.43, P.44, P.50, P.55, P.57, P.58, P.59, P.61, P.63, P.67.\nThis is not intended as a complete list of paintings in which the sketches were used, but it does demonstrate that once Carlevarijs had devised his principal figure types he used them again and again throughout his career. He presumably worked them up from pen and pencil sketches from life such as those also in the Museum (D.1352A-1887), several of which relate in general terms to the oil sketches. \n\nProv.

It is difficult to form a chronology for Carlevaris's drawings because he showed little sign of stylistic development, few of his early drawings survive, and none is documented.  The [sic] have a realistic liveliness and subtle humour that anticipates figures by the Tiepolos and Pietro Longhi.  Important holdings of Carlevaris's drawings are at the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the Correr Museum in Venice.  The 18th century volume of drawings at the Victoria and Albert Museum from which these drawings are taken, entitled <i>Studi figurati diversi di Luca Callevaris</i>, contains 32 sheets of drawings of men and women in Venetian costume, of which only two are considered to be early.

She holds a fan in her left hand and wears a pink and white dress with laced bodice and long sleeves.  It is one of Carlevarijs\u2019 studies known as <i>macchiette</i>, the quick sketches he made with daubs of colour to indicate animated Venetian figures.  Carlevarijs first drew the figures on paper, copying them from people he saw in the streets and then transformed them into lively oil sketches, such as this one, which represent a crucial part of his artistic process. Studies such as these would ultimately form part of a Venetian <i>veduta</i> or prospect painting, such as the Getty <i>Bucintoro</i>, which is a genre Carlevarijs is generally credited with establishing in the eighteenth century. He populated his <i>vedute</i> with elegantly posed and well-dressed figures, concealing the decline of the Republic under the splendour of the pageants, festivals and regattas he often represented. Carlevarijs' sketches also demonstrate his great influence on Canaletto, whose figures and their arrangement often show a marked debt to the older Master such as in <i>Venice: The Feast Day of Saint Roch</i> ca. 1735 (National Gallery, London, NG937).",

Composed of 104 views of Venice, the etchings formed the most complete survey of the fabric of the city ever produced and served as a model for Venetian view painters throughout the 18th century.   Carlevarijs' sketches reveal a particular attention to costume, highlighting Venetian style of dress which was highly regarded in fashionable circles throughout Europe from the 16th through the 18th centuries. The maritime republic imported raw materials from the Far East and exported finished products including highly desirable velvets and brocades. The taste for Venetian textiles persisted into the 18th century. In this period however, Venice's power was dwindling and her government corrupt. The city nevertheless sought to present a facade of a wealthy city peopled with bright and gregarious multitude engaged in pleasurable pursuits. As Carlevarijs stated in the dedication to <i>Le fabriche,</i> he intended his paintings to <i>'rendere pi\u00f9 facile alla notitzia de Paesi stranieri le Venete Magnificenze'</i> [render more clearly the magnificence of Venice to foreign countries]",
