            "public_access_description": "Sheffield plate originated with the discovery in 1742 by a working cutler of Sheffield, Thomas Boulsover (1704-88), that bars of silver and copper, in unequal proportions, fused by heating under pressure, could be rolled into sheets of laminated metal and worked like silver.  The industry this material created flourished for approximately one hundred years until superseded by electroplating in the 1840s.\n\nThe process Joseph Hancock (1711-1790) developed for the large-scale production fused plate (Sheffield plate) differed little throughout the course of the industry.  An ingot of copper was covered with a thin sheet of sterling silver.  These ingots were approximately 1\u00bd to 1\u00be inches thick and 2\u00bd inches wide by 8 inches long.  This could vary according to the weight and size of the plated sheet that was required to be made.  Generally speaking however, the thickness of the silver sheet was 1/40 that of the copper block which meant that 10-12 oz of silver was used for every 8 lbs of copper.\n\nAfter about 1760, it became the practice to plate two sides of the copper ingot so that the resulting sheet was plated with silver on both sides.  Samuel Roberts (1763-1849) patented a variation (no. 5963, July 1830) whereby a sheet of German silver, an alloy of copper, zinc and nickel, was inserted between the silver and the copper block.  This produced a laminate of far greater durability.",
