It is drawn in pen and ink with watercolour, which picks out typical Japanese colours of sage green and blue. It is similar in layout to the proposed interiors that were shown in the  catalogue 'Art Furniture', designed by Edward W. Godwin and manufactured by William Watt of 21 Grafton Street, London. It contained hints and suggestions on domestic furniture and decorations and was published in 1876.\n\nDesign & Designing\nBy the 1870s Godwin had begun to produce designs for the furniture firm of William Watt, inspired by the Japanese use of lacquer. Godwin did not directly copy Japanese examples, but combined both Chinese and Japanese influences, which can be seen in the chairs in this drawing. He also aimed to combine the simplicity and elegance he admired in Japanese art with the needs of the Victorian home.\n\nInfluence\nGodwin frequently used an inverted heart  or 'cloud' design, especially for the backs and sides of hanging cabinets.  He found this pattern in a print of a Japanese hotel by the artist Aim\u00e9 Humbert.  In this drawing you can see it in the hanging cabinet at the centre of the drawing. This shape was later used in furniture made by Liberty's and became a trademark for the furniture manufacturer, Heal & Son in the 1890s.",
