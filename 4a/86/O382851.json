By the 19th century these chains had fallen out of fashion.  Only priests, and people who wore traditional dress, continued to use them.  It is impossible to date these chains accurately, as they remained unchanged for centuries, and are rarely marked.\n\nRussian filigree chains are usually made from scrolls of wire soldered together side by side to make individual links.  This chain has links of three scrolls each, but wide chains can have as many as eight.  At each end it has a decorative terminal with a large loop at the end.  The pieces of wire hooked through these loops were originally part of a single U-shaped link, which would have held a cross or religious pendant.",
