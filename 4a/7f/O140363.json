This folio from a Kalpasutra manuscript has a picture in two registers on both the front and on the reverse. Both concern incidents in the life of the Jina Neminatha, 21st Tirthankara.\n\nOn one side, numbered IM.10A-1931, the text is on the right and the illustration on the left. The subject is Neminatha's marriage to Rajimati. Above, the Jina in his marriage procession, dressed as a bridegroom, is driven in a chariot pulled by a horse and driven by a charioteer. He sees the pen enclosing the animals to be slaughtered for the marriage feast. Having seen this he refuses to be married and, below, he is driven away, followed by Rajimati. \n\nThe other side of the folio, numbered IM.10-1931, has the text on the left and the picture on the right. It shows in the upper register: Neminatha distributing alms. In the lower register: Neminatha plucks out his hair in five handfuls. It is collected by the god Shakra.\n\nThe text is handwritten in gold in Nandinagari characters. It is on a red ground with blue edgings. There is a red medallion in a blue surround in the centre of each side.",

            "public_access_description": "The Kalpasutra (Book of Rituals) is the most important canonical text in Jain literature for the Svetambaras (white-clad), one of the two sects of Jainism.  Jainism is one of the oldest religions to have survived until the present time and its basic teaching is one of non-violence.  The Kalpasutra is divided into three sections.   The first section deals with the lives of the twenty-four Jinas or Tirthankaras, who were the Jain spiritual teachers or 'ford-makers'.  The second part deals with the life of Mahavira, the twenty-fourth Tirthankara.  The third part deals with rules for the ascetics and laws during the four months (chaturmas) of the rainy season, when ascetics temporarily abandon their wandering life and settle down amidst the laity. This is the time when the festival of Paryushan is celebrated and the Kalpasutra is traditionally recited.\n\nThis folio from a Kalpasutra manuscript has a picture in two registers on both the front and on the reverse. Both concern important incidents in the life of the Jina Neminatha, the 21st Tirthankara. On one side, Neminatha is to be married to Rajimati. Above, the Jina is in his marriage procession, dressed as a bridegroom and driven in a chariot. However, he sees the pen enclosing all the animals to be slaughtered for the marriage feast. Having seen this he refuses to be married and, below, he is driven away, followed by Rajimati. \n\nThe other side of the folio shows Neminatha preparing for his renunciation of worldly life and embarkation on his spiritual search as a wandering ascetic. In the upper register: he is distributing alms to the poor, including an elderly bearded man. In the lower register: Neminatha plucks out his hair in five handfuls to begin his ascetic life.",
