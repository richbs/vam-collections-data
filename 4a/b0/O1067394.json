London: The Victoria and Albert Museum in association with Hurtwood Press, 1983.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n\"<i>Eva Watson-Sch\u00fctze   American   1867-1935\nWoman admiring a print   About 1910\nBromoil\n203 X 156 mm   Mus. no. Ph.380-1982   Purchase</i>\n\nThe Bromoil process, invented in 1907, was developed by C.Welbourne Piper from an idea by E.J. Wall.  It was a variant of the oil-pigment process.  Prints, or more usually, enlargements were made on a suitable gelatin-silver bromide paper, and the image was bleached in a solution containing potassium bichromate.  The gelatin became selectively hardened so that it would take up more or less pigment when hand applied with special brushes.  The bleached image was thus 'redeveloped' in pigment, the distribution of which was to a large extent under the photographer's control.  Bromoil prints, which may be in a variety if colours, generally show broader tonal effects and more diffuse detail than conventional prints. \nThis example is by a member of the circle of Alfred Stieglitz, who collected examples of her work and published her photographs in <i>Camera Work</i>.  She was a member of The Linked Ring and of the Photo-Secession.  This example is signed with her monogram which echoes the calligraphic inscriptions typical of Chinese and Japanese prints and brush drawings (powerful inspirations for photographers of the period).  The print being admired in the photograph is, however, likely to have been a fine photograph and this picture suggests the attention paid by photographers of the Stieglitz circle and in other international centres to the highest standards of craftsmanship in making photographic prints.  Eva Watson-Sch\u00fctze was praised by fellow photographer and critic Joseph T. Keiley for the 'delicate taste and artistic originality' of her work.\"",
