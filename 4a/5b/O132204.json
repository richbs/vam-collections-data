Every fashionable woman was expected to have one in her wardrobe for parties and clubbing. At its most daring, the little black dress demanded a brave wearer with a toned body and/or supreme self confidence. Elasticated fabrics such as Lycra made the dresses hug the wearer tightly. Cutaway panels either exposed bare flesh, or were filled in with sheer fabric. Corset lacing emphasised the overt sexuality of the designs.\n\nThis micro-mini dress from Val Piriou's Spring-Summer collection of 1991 audaciously combines all these elements. The designer also produced swimwear designed along the same lines as her little black dresses.",
