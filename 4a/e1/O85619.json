She is shown against a blue oval background surrounded by a plain crimson frame.  She wears a transparent <i>odhani</i> over her head and shoulders.  It has a polka-dot pattern of stylised red quatrefoils with golden borders.  She wears pearls with a red gem on her forehead, a pearl earring with a green gemstone drop and a matching green drop under a faceted crimson gem attached to her clothes on her chest.  She also has two rows of pearls at her throat and two longer rows falling down below.  Her nails and finger tips are coloured red.  There is little modelling to the face.\n  The painting is framed in green paper strips decorated with a gold design of stylised lotus buds set within white, gold and black outlines.  The border design of  red poppies and pink lilies with gold outlines and detailing are set on an ivory-coloured ground.  The page has buff-coloured strips of paper with a white line along the inner edge along its margins, and a further beige-coloured strip of paper stuck along the right hand edge as a gutter for the binding of the album.",

It contains 62 leaves on which are Mughal miniature paintings, drawing and flower studies on both sides. The binding is covered with an Indian brocade silk that may have been cut from lengths brought home by the 2nd Lord Clive, who served as Governor of Madras, 1799 to 1803.
