As she describes it: 'Tube delays are rife in London as commuters struggle to get to work on time. The infrastructure of the tube, as shown in a series of investigations by the Evening Standard, is crumbling, and the repairs are shambolic and inefficient. With every line that is closed there is a domino effect and tube travellers are faced with persistent delays.'\n\n'Marf' drew daily topical cartoons for the Evening Standard between March 2002 and August 2005, moving to the Londoner's Diary page in August 2003. The drawings cover key political and social issues of the period, providing a vivid and often hilarious response to the main news of the day. The Evening Standard is London's only evening newspaper, publishing up to five editions a day. In Marf's own words: 'The cartoonist needs to keep up with the rapid pace of event.'",
