However, there are also similarities with works in France, so we cannot narrow down its country of origin. \n\nThe \u2018Passion\u2019 is the story of Christ\u2019s suffering and death beginning with his arrest on Holy Thursday and ending with his burial (\u2018entombment\u2019) on Good Friday evening. When Christ was brought before the Roman governor in Jerusalem, Pontius Pilate, he was questioned and then condemned to death. He was tied to a post and whipped (\u2018flagellated\u2019). This was the usual practice under Roman law for those condemned to crucifixion.",
