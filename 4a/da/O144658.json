            "history_note": "Educated at Oxford and a mathematician, musician, painter and parson, Calvert Richard Jones was introduced to photography by a cousin of William Henry Fox Talbot, British inventor of the negative/positive process. Subsequently, Jones became one of the few Britons to produce a substantial body of calotype in Britain and abroad. His work stands out in the early development of photography because of his ability to fuse his technical skill with his training as a watercolorist.\n\nMargam Castle, the country house in this photograph, had been built recently by Christopher (Kit) Rice Mansel Talbot (a cousin of W.H.F.Talbot). Calvert Jones was a close friend and neighbour of Kit Talbot; they were contemporaries at Oriel College Oxford and had shared interests. The series of house portraits of Margam may have been made by Jones as a gift for Talbot. \n\nThe photograph shows the east side of Margam and the lower height buildings constructed round two service courts. The reclining foreground figure, who gazes towards the castle, lifts this essentially topographical image to an arranged composition. Three wedge-shaped shadows from the buttresses on the nearest building add to the myriad of decorative motifs. A long triangular shadow on the side of the square tower leads the eye back to the figure on the bank and his brightly lit shirt and hand.",

The house was built round a complex of three courtyards. The octagonal tower in the centre of this photograph rises from the centre of the main block. Two service blocks, part of which appear in this photograph, were built on the east side.",
