The 19th century saw a craze for ceramic figurines of performers and Agatha Walker attempted to revive this tradition with her limited edition sculptures, modelled from life in plaster and coated with a fine layer of wax which was then coloured.  In 1931 Agatha Walker's wax figures were exhibited at the Fine Art Society.\n\nThis represents the actress and singer Elsie French as Mrs Peachum in John Gay's The Beggar's Opera which opened at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith on 5 June 1920. Elsie French had performed in music hall, concerts and revue before playing Mrs Peachum, a role she played again in the revivals at the Lyric Theatre in 1928 and 1930. This is one of a set of characters from the opera produced by Agatha Walker in 1921. The Beggar's Opera ran for three years and was a great success for the theatre's owner Sir Nigel Playfair who had purchased the lease of the derelict theatre building in 1918 in a syndicate.  He transformed it into a highly successful venue, putting Hammersmith firmly on the theatrical map.",
