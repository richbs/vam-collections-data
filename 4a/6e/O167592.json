Finer and more elaborate than the ceiling in Bishopsgate\".  Norman encloses a rough sketch of the ceiling and notes that Lord Dillon has plasterwork of this kind at Ditchly done by Italian plasterers in 1725-26 \"but I should think this was later\".  Norman has been told that the plasterwork at the top end, above the boy's head has been restored.  He describes the room as \"not large\u2026..It is panelled throughout and has a wooden mantlepiece with fluted pilasters of no great merit\".\n\n23/2/06 Minute papers\nrecords Mr Kendricks visit to take photographs (Bromide prints).  He was assisted by Mr H C Clarke, the surveyor to the premises & by Messrs Herbert Brothers, the tenants until March of 16 Bishopsgate, owned by the Cordwainers Company.\n\n19/3/06 Minute papers, A B Skinner\nrecord his visit with Mr Kendrick to see the ceiling at 16 Bishopsgate offered by the Cordwainers Co. to the Museum as the premises are being demolished.  He attached photographs (not on file).  \"It is a Georgian ceiling of about 1750 and is in a very good state of preservation, with the exception of two modern medallions at the corners seen in photographic\u2026there is\u2026the usual accumulation of whitewash which can easily be removed\".  Skinner feels the museum should not take the whole of the ceiling and he outlines which sections and ornamental details should be obtained, so that with photographs and a measured drawing it would be possible to reproduce it.\n\n11/4/06 Report of objects received\nlists \n\"5 panels, 1 piece of cornice and 4 boxes of additional pieces forming portions of a ceiling\" removed from No. 16 Bishopsgate St.\nAn additional notation in pencil reads \"Large ceiling (8 pieces) 478-1906.  Fragments of border from another ceiling 523-1906\".",
