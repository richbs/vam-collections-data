Executed in 1561-2, the figures were not incorporated into a fountain until 1569-70. After being shipped to Spain in 1601, the figures were given to Charles I of England by Philip IV of Spain. They are now in the Victoria and Albert Museum. These drawings indicate that Giambologna kept the preliminary terrcotta models for these schemes on wooden shelves in his studio.",
