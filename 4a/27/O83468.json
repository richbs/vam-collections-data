The design of the hat  suggests the idea of speed and is named  'Coniston' after the lake where Donald Campbell broke the world land-speed record in 1967. The hat is lined with bird of paradise feathers which give an iridescent sheen to the interior of the folds.\n \nSir Frederick Fox retired from the millinery business in 2002, following 40 years of hat-making. Australian born Fox moved to London in 1958 to work with milliners Otto Lucas and later Mitzi Lorenz. In 1964 he opened his own salon in London's Brook street. Milliner to the Queen since 1969, Fox designed classic styles made to the highest standard and worn by an international clientele to imporatant public and private events. He was noted for his technical skill in making hats and his use of the highest quality materials . \n\nFollowing his retirement Fox returned to Australia and became a patron of the Australian Millinery Association.",
