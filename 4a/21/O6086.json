Here, the bowl of a humble jelly glass has been blown into a mould to form a pattern of elongated ovals (as a cheap imitation of wheel-cutting), the 'knop' (a decorative bulbous swelling) probably formed from the pinched end of the mesh-blown bowl, with an applied solid foot. It is said that a glassmakers' 'chair', consisting of a 'gaffer' in his special chair working in a perfectly-orchestrated way with three assistants, could make a three-piece wine glass in four minutes. No doubt this jelly glass would have taken about the same time.",
