George Devine imposed this house style after starting the English Stage Company in 1956, when he became artistic director of the theatre. Devine's plan was to create a writers' theatre, with a view to discovering new writers and producing serious contemporary works. Look Back in Anger, which he produced in 1956, is often seen as the starting point of modern British drama.\n\nWritten by John Osborne, Look Back in Anger is the story of a love triangle involving an intelligent but disaffected young man (Jimmy Porter), his upper-middle-class, impassive wife (Alison), and her snooty best friend (Helena Charles). Cliff, an amiable Welsh lodger, attempts to keep the peace. \n\nThe play was a success on the London stage, and spawned the term \"angry young men\" to describe Osborne and other writers of his generation who employed harshness and realism, in contrast to the majority of West End writing, seen as more escapist fare. It transferred to Broadway the following year, receiving three Tony award nominations.",
