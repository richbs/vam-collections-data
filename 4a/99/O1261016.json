It features sixty full colour illustrations, tracing British history, with some global exceptions, from Tudor times to 1855.  Drawn by a range of artists, the images make reference to famous events and inventions, reinterpreted in a bright and often humorous style meant  to engage children. The grand narrative view they offer of history is told through the everyday anecdotes of shops and streets, as well as war and technological revolution.",
