This attitude was a conscious rejection of modernist functionalism. They turned instead to historical styles for inspiration, or imaginatively reconstructed ancient styles, as with the 'Barbarian' range of chairs, sconces, lamps and tables.  \n\nDesigned in 1981, this furniture was made from coarse wrought iron, and for this chair an animal hide was laced into the frame as upholstery.  Its intention is to evoke primitive ways of living, yet it is anything but primitive, and relies on a sophisticated understanding of design and art history for its effect.  The wrought iron consciously suggests the mid-twentieth century furniture of Diego Giacometti, while the form of the chair is relatively conventional.",

It was often highly stylized, decorated or at least decorative and always visually arresting. One such example is the Barbarian range, designe dby Elizabeth Garouste and Matthia Bonetti in France (1981). This was made of wrought iron, deliberately coarse, that recalled the archaeological quiality of Alberto and Diego Giacometti's cast bronze furniture, as well as finding resonance with furniture by London-based makers such as Arad and Andre Dubreuil.",
