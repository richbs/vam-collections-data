Over the years they have created a very impressive range of pedal planes, cars, trikes and similar. \n\nThe pedal plane was acquired by the Museum during its \u00a35m refurbishment for a new display in the 'Moving Toys Gallery'. It was chosen as a good example of a contemporary moving toy to go alongside highlights of the Museum's own collection in the new displays. With its 50s design and pale pink colour, it represents a girls toy, to stand in contrast to the many male orientated trucks and moving vehicles the Museum has.",
