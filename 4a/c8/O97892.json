This apparatus was intended for feeding through liquid food and drinks for astronauts in anti-gravity environments. The USA's NASA (National Aeronautical and Space Administration) Skylab project during the late 1960s was the most progressive and high profile space-design programme and the styles that developed from its technological and idealistic advances were adopted widely throughout the world and were particulalry prelevant during the late 1960s and 1970s. Loewy was already a highly established designer by this point and was commissioned to work for NASA from 1967 as an habitability consultant for the Apollo Saturn Applications programme, SKYLAB, earth orbiter recuperable shuttle and in advance research and development for large space bases: experimental concepts. The rectangular forms with curved corners and the use of browns and oranges became very popular.",
