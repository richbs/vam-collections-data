A Kunstkammer was a room (or rooms) in a large private house or palace specially reserved for the display of rare, valuable and intriguing objects, both natural and man-made, to select visitors. In the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, automata that incorporated mechanical clocks regularly appeared in inventories of these rooms. In this example the tortoise's head jerks in and out from under its shell as the object is rolled along. The merman on top of the shell (known as a triton) is designed to raise its arms and bring its trident down on the head of the moving tortoise. However the crude workmanship of triton and its disproportionate size in relation to the tortoise suggest it is a later alteration, and that the tortoise may originally have carried only a clock on its back.",

It entered the collections after his death.\nNothing is known of the early history of this object. The triton figure seems to be the result of a later alteration to the piece. It is crudely cast in comparison with the head and feet of the tortoise, and disproportionately large. Moreover, the presence of a triton - a mythical merman familiar in marine iconography - is curious and suggests that at some stage the V&amp;A tortoise was confused with a turtle. The hole now used to secure the triton probably once held a clock. A comparable example (Augsburg, ca. 1610, now in Darmstadt, Hessisches Landesmuseum) shows a rider on a turtle, seated closer to the turtle's head, with a clock fixed to the top of the turtle's shell. The V&amp;A tortoise has no piercings that suggest there ever was a figure seated towards the edge of the shell.",
