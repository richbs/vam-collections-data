In this watercolour Millais depicts this subject as it was described in a poem by John Keats (1819). Millais shows the heroine in the act of undressing for bed, suddenly transfixed by a sense of awe at the significance of the occasion. The model for the girl was Millais' wife Effie. The watercolour is a version of the larger oil painting of the same subject that he exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1863. He set up the scene with great care, taking Effie to Knole Park, a vast Jacobean house in Sevenoaks, Kent. He posed her in a freezing room, standing before the bed in which James I (ruled 1603-25) was said to have slept.",

ISBN I 85177 393 2\n<u>100 Great Paintings in The Victoria & Albert Museum.</u> London: V&A, 1985, p.168\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"Sir John Everett Millais\n<i>British School</i> \n<i>The Eve of St Agnes</i> \nWater-colour, 20.3 X 26 cm \nD.141-1906. <i>Purchase from the collection of P H Rathbone.</i> \n \nMillais is always remembered for his precocious talent for painting and technical ability. He exhibited a mammoth history painting at the Royal Academy at the age of 17 which paved the way for a successful career. The desire for success was the motivating force behind much of Millais' work, especially from the 1870s onwards when his style developed apace with sentimental but popular Victorian taste. However, the 1860s was a time of transition for Millais. In <i>the Eve of St Agnes</i> he harks back to earlier Pre-Raphaelite works, both in the choice and treatment of the subject matter. \n\nMillais has depicted a scene from a poem by Keats in which the heroine performs an elaborate ritual in order to dream of her future husband. Millais has caught her at the moment when she is undressing, transfixed by the awe of this special night, the Eve of St Agnes. This water-colour is a version of the larger oil painting of the same subject exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1863, and now in the collection of the Queen Mother. Millais followed an exacting formula during the painting of the St Agnes, in keeping with the Pre-Raphaelite method of obtaining complete verisimilitude, as when he placed Lizzie Siddal in a bath of water to pose for his famous <i>Ophelia</i> of 1852. Millais journeyed to Knole Park and there in a freezing room, with the bed on which James I was said to have slept, he painted the oil version. For three nights Lady Millais posed in her bodice as Madeleine, the heroine of the poem, while moonbeams fell across her body at the required angle to produce the lattice shadow effect. \n\nMillais was primarily a painter in oils, but his technical versatility enabled him to translate the ghostly mood of mystery of the St Agnes legend into the medium of water-colour. The study, probably painted later in the same year, shows an overall grey-green effect rendering the 'wintry moon' and atmosphere of Keats' poem. Even the blue of her dress enhances the coldness and trance-like quality expressed by Keats. Millais admirably captures the stillness and tension of the moment when the girl, transfixed, dares not look round for fear of breaking the spell.\n\nCritics did not like the oil version when it was exhibited. Tom Taylor, a dramatist, referred to Lady Millais as that 'scraggy model' and Sir Francis Grant said 'I cannot bear that woman with the grid iron', referring to the shadows of the window falling on Lady Millais. Really the critics probably objected to Millais' return to Pre-Raphaelite methods, for as an evocation of Keatsian romanticism both the oil and the water-colour are perfectly expressed.\n\nAlex Noble\"\n<u>Vikutoria & Arub?to Bijutsukan-z? : eikoku romanshugi kaigaten = The Romantic tradition in British painting, 1800-1950 : masterpieces from the Victoria and Albert Museum / selected by Mark Evans</u> [Japan : Brain Trust], 2002. 185 p. : ill.
