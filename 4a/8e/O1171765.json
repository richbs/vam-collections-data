It is an early design by Marion Foale and Sally Tuffin, who worked together from 1961-1972. They were known for their lively, graphic and very wearable designs intended for active young women to wear in a wide range of circumstances. They were among the first designers to regularly create tailored trouser-suits for women, although this crisply cut jacket is paired with a more traditional skirt.\n\nMarit Allen (1941-2007) was a leading British fashion journalist who started as an assistant at Queen magazine in 1961. In 1964, she joined British Vogue, where she stayed for ten years. Her 'Young Idea' pages were hugely influential. Many young and innovative designers, such as John Bates and Foale & Tuffin, received significant exposure through Allen, who not only gave them magazine coverage, but happily wore their clothes herself.",
