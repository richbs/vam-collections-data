However the style of the figures and the architecture have closer similarities with Parisian translucent enamels of the 14th century. Some scholars have suggested that this object could be an example of Limoges-style enamel made in Paris.\n\nComparisons in style have been made between this pyx and the goldsmith work of the reliquary of Jeanne D'Evreux, 1339, believed to be made in Paris.\n\nThe decoration upon the lid may be a coat of arms.\n\nSeveral pyxes of this style, shape and colouring survive.

The Eucharist is the bread transformed into the Body of Christ during the Christian Mass. Wafers of bread were handed out to the congregation and left over pieces were stored in pyxes- decorative boxes suitably precious to hold such important items. Pyxes could also be used by priests to transport the blessed bread to the sick. A large proportion of surviving medieval pyxes are decorated in enamel. This may have been partly due to the relatively inexpensive nature of the raw materials compared to gold and silver, however the popularity of enamel was also due to its ability to colour metal which enabled a wide variety of iconographic designs.",
