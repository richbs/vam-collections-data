There was, rather later, I think, a variation of the same idea in use, in which the circular screen was opened, stood on its own leg in a small weighted cylindrical base, on the table when folded up it retired into the base, which was made of brass. In this variation, however, there was no means of altering the angle of the screen, as in the one you have. I should imagine that 1840 would be about the date. I resuced the screen many years ago from being thrown away with other odds and ends of my grandmother, Mrs. Charles Rogers.\" From the donor's letter dated Nov. 8, 1929.",
