In the centre is a lobed lozenge outlined with white circles and a red dot.  There is an 8-pointed star in the middle surrounded by 4 cypress trees and four small botehs.  The field is covered with tiny floral motifs and random stitches.  The same pattern of white and red circles forms a second lobed lozenge around the first. That space has red carnation-like flowers on the green ground.  The four corners are triangular and filled with stitches: a cypress tree and 2 botehs and a quarter section of a series of concentric circles, one of which has an outline of three stars embroidered in black on it.\nThere is a wide border almost entirely covered with embroidery.  The recognisable designs include cypress trees and two types of very curved botehs.\nA narrow outer border is edged with the white and red circles and contains a narrow black meander with red carnation-like blossoms.\nThe edges of the cover are unembroidered green twill.\nColours: Z2S; red, orange, blue, white, black, purple.\n\nFor a similar piece see 1062-1875.  Note: this is not identical to 874-1877.",
