            "public_access_description": "This chair was designed by George Hunzinger in New York and made around 1876. It reflected the desire of nineteenth-century designers to experiment with technologically innovative furniture-making techniques.\n\nNearly all the wood parts are turned rather than carved (the traditional means of treatment), a method of decoration which Hunzinger preferred. Hunzinger took out two patents for this chair. The second patent introduced wire or flat metal strips in place of cane for seats and backs \u2018to insure great strength and beauty\u2019. The strips were secured by pins and were \u2018covered with threads wound or braided . . . and might be painted or varnished\u2019 so the sitter did not come into direct contact with the metal. The result is a chair that has a remarkably strong structure.",

The second patent covered the use of wire or flat metal strips in place of cane for seats and backs \"to insure great strength and beauty\" (United States Patent 176, 314, 18 April 1876). The strips were \"covered with threads wound or braided . . . and might be painted or varnished\" so that the sitter did not come into direct contact with the metal. The patent covered the manner in which the strips were laid into grooves cut into the seat frame and the technique for securing the strips by means of pins set into the underside of the frame. This ingenious use of metal resulted in a remarkably strong structure.",

            "historical_context_note": "In 19th-century America patents were used not only to protect original designs or the technical features of products but, increasingly, as a selling device to signal novelty and innovation. In 1867, George Hunzinger advertised himself as 'Manufacturer of Patent Folding, Reclining and Extension CHAIRS', and virtually all his extant pieces are marked with details of his patents. In an expanding and increasingly competitive marketplace, patents represented a way for Hunzinger and others to distinguish their goods and to establish an identity.\n\nHunziger was born in Tuttlingen, W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany, into a family of cabinet-makers with whom he served his apprenticeship. He worked as a journeyman in Geneva, Switzerland, for a time and came to New York in the 1850s during the peak of German emigration to America. Hunzinger built a large and successful business which prospered until the 1920s.",
