Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. Above all, they had to have the means for attaching a cord. Netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated being the katabori (shape carving), a three-dimensional carving, such as this one in the form of an rakan (disciple of Buddha) with a lion.  From the 1700s onwards, netsuke were increasingly signed with the carver\u2019s name. Although this example is signed \u2018Shuzan\u2019, there were many carvers who usesd this name and it is uncertain which Shuzan this refers to.",
