In the sea, where the sun does not reach, there are no shadows, so when she steps onto the shore and the moon casts her shadow on the sand, she thinks it is another person.  The 'shadow dance' became the ballet's most famous image, celebrated in paintings and prints, which were avidly collected by Elssler's fans. Her spirited and sensuous dancing won her many male admirers, unlike the spiritual and ethereal performances of her great rival, Marie Taglioni, whose appeal was primarily to women.\nThis print, by the American Nathanial Currier, commemorates Elssler's huge popularity in America, where she toured in the early 1840s. She was so popular, that, according to legend, Congress agreed not to meet when she was dancing so that members could go to her performances.",
