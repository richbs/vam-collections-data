The watercolour illustrated here shows a street in which different ethnic types are represented. The Christian Serbs include two women in traditional Serb costume with their elaborate headdresses, a youth, and a man wearing a brown cloak and fur hat. Among the Muslim Turks are two men conversing, possibly Ottoman officials; some women in their usual outdoor dress with yashmaks covering their heads, making purchases from a street vendor; and an old man, seated with crossed legs, watching life go by. In the background looms the gaunt ruin of the Gate of Prince Eugene of Savoy, part of the Small Kalemegdan or fortress of Belgrade. The Gate was built in 1717 to commemorate the Austrian victory over the Turks that year. \n\nGoebel was an Austrian watercolourist and lithographer who specialised in landscapes and scenes of local life. He travelled widely, visiting Belgrade in the 1860s.",
