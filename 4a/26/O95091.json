            "public_access_description": "This is an ivory house-altar depicting a Crucifixion scene and is attributed to Jean-Antoine Belleteste (1731-1811).The Belleteste family was one of the foremost families of ivory carvers in France. There are no signed pieces known by him, nevertheless the attribution of this altar is made on the grounds of the intricate detail of this piece which is consistent with his other work. Christ is shown on the cross with the figures of the sorrowing Virgin, St John the Evangelist and St Mary Magdalene at the foot of the cross. The whole is housed in a glazed ebony case which stands on four bun feet of ivory. The fine detailing and the iconography used for the Passion are typical of the work of the Belleteste family of ivory carvers, who were active in Dieppe in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Two closely similar crucifixion scenes are in the Chateau-Mus\u00e9e of Dieppe, signed by Belleteste (almost certainly Jean-Antoine): one is dated 1761. Dieppe was a leading centre of ivory carving during the 18th and 19th centuries. Jean-Antoine Belleteste, to whom this house-altar is attributed, and his family were among the most renowned of the ivory sculptors active there at that time.",
