The envelope ... contains seven Polaroid transfer prints and one photo paired with eight letterpressed cards with printed phrases that refer to each image.\n\nThe cards, or broadsides, resemble the death notices commonly plastered throughout the towns of Southern Italy and small towns even in the north, with black cornices or decorative borders, and bold sans-serif typefaces' - accompanying sheet.\n\nThe phrases on the cards appear in the following order, forming a natural grouping of rhyming pairs: Softporn, Popcorn; We buy, Animals cry; Circus clown, We drown; Animals rear, We disappear.\n\n'These images were photographed on the streets of Calabria ... The seven transfer prints, originally in the form of slides, were printed with an instant slide printer and transferred onto damp etching paper with a roller' - colophon.\n\nLimited edition of 20 copies.
