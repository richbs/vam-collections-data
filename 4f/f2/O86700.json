His thin and bony right leg is set forward.  The upper part of his body is extremely thin with his belly drawn in.  In his left hand he holds a water gourd.  He is bearded with long tangled hair staring towards the middle of the scene.   Behind him stands another youthful  ascetic with his hands joined in worship.  His hair is gathered in bun and piled on the top of his head.  On the left are two  figures almost destroyed except for the cloaks they are wearing.",
