Her early work used images of popular culture that were bold, vulgar and often confrontational. This T-shirt, titled Tits in Space  features a design of balls covered in a 'skin' of cigarettes. She first used this motif in a repeating pattern on wallpaper as the backdrop to an exhibition of her work entitled 'The Fag Show' in 2000, at the Sadie Coles gallery in London. In a press release for the show Lucas said, 'I first started smoking when I was nine, and I first started trying to make something out of cigarettes because I like to use relevant kind of materials. I've got these cigarettes around so why not use them?' The T-shirt was featured in a V&A self-guided tour or trail titled More than Meets the Eye in late 2000 which focused on the interplay between artistic expression, scientific understanding, and technological innovation.",
