            "physical_description": "A rectangular tray on a low raised foot, with an everted rim. Decorated  in black lacquer inlaid with mother-of-pearl, showing floral scrolls and figure scenes.\nConstruction: The substance of the core not known. Over the core is layer of fabric, clearly visible on the right edge of the rim. This is overlaid with a layer of greyish composition, then a thin layer of black lacquer, then a second layer of composition, then the top coat of lacquer. The inner edge of the rim is strengthened with twisted silver wire, and two lines of twisted silver wire, about 7 mm. apart, strengthen the join between base and rim on the upper side.\nDECORATION: The outer surface of the foot is decorated with a three-bar zig-zag in strips of mother-of-pearl. Between each group of three bars is a half star in three chips of mother-of-pearl. The underside of the foot and base are lacquered plain black.\nThe outside of the rim is decorated with fungus scrolls in mother-of-pearl with incised detail. The interior of the rim is decorated with inlaid floral scrolls, showing stylized flowers of the four seasons. There is one flower on each short side, six on each long side. Ogival corner panels are filled with intersecting circle 'cash' diaper, with a four piece star in the centre of each circle. Similarly decorated ogival panels in the middle of each long  side divide the floral scrolls, with three flowers on either side. The scrolling shows incised detail.\nThe central panel is decorated with two horesmen with attendants. They ride right-left over a bridge. A pine and a willow tree fill the centre of the scene. On the right, a group of figures in front of the building see them off. The sky contains clouds, birds and a moon, with incised character 'yue' (moon).\n PROVENANCE: Formerly in the Ohtsuka and Figgess Collections. Formerly Garner Loan no.27\nLITERATURE: Published as no. 129 in ' Chinese and Associated Lacquer from the Garner Collection' (the British Museum 1973)\nCOMPARE: A similar tray in the Osaka municipal museum is illustrated in 'Min Shin no Bijutsu' (Osaka Municipal Museum/ Asahi Shimbunsha 1980), catalogue number 2-15. This tray is decorated with an identical central scene, but has ogival panels in the corners only, while the floral scrolling appears to consist of only one flower. The central designs of the two trays must depend on a common model (possibly printed ?), and it may even be that they are products of the same workshops.\nWang Shixiang opinion 9/1983: 'Jiajing' period.\nOpinion of Julie Chou Ling, National Palace Museum, Taiwan, 22/20/1988: The subject may be 'Jin Jing Fu Kao'. Hurrying to the capital fot the examinations, with the candidate's elderly parents and wives seeing him off. The season is summer time, as the blooming lotuses show. The exams were held in the the autumn, so a summer departure was necessary for candidates from the south, to allow time on the road. Alternatively, the subject is just 'chu you'. (cc 24.10.1988)",
