The dress appears to have been remodelled from a late 19th-century evening dress. Unpicking and re-making clothes is part of the history of fashionable dress. Clothes were altered for economic and sometimes sentimental reasons.  In this example the seamstress has skilfully combined late 19th-century and early 20th-century fabrics and trimmings to create a romantic and attractive wedding gown.\n\nThe design is also inspired by 17th-century costume. The wide bands of cream Italian furnishing lace are in the style of early 17th-century Genoese bobbin lace. They form the extended bib front, collar and sleeve trimmings. Three delicate long tassels hang in a graceful line down the left-hand side of the dress. Tassels were extremely popular at the time. In 1907 The Lady's Realm commented 'cords and tassels, after embroideries, take the foremost place in the world of trimmings'. Fashion periodicals and instruction manuals showed the less well-off how to make their own tassels and motifs in silk or cotton.",

George Adam died in Paris in 1930, after which time Pearl Adam returned to England where she continued her work, which included writing the History of the National Council of Women of Great Britain in 1945.
