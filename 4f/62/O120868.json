Kean first appeared in the role in London at Drury Lane Theatre on 12 February 1814.  The performance was a revelation and after the first performance the theatre was crammed to capacity for every one of the 68 nights he played Richard that season. He acted with a supreme feel for malevolence, and was always best in duplicitous roles, having no success in comic parts.\n\nKean was the son of an actress at Drury Lane Theatre and as a child he was paraded as an infant phenomenon, billed as \u2018The Celebrated Theatrical Child, Edmund Carey, not eleven years old'.  He became a strolling player, dancer and tumbler with Richardson's company and worked in the provinces until he made his first adult stage appearance in 1804. It wasn't until 1814 however, when he appeared as Shylock at Drury Lane Theatre that he made his name and became known as the great but erratic actor described by the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge as revealing Shakespeare by 'flashes of lightning'.",
