The series is called 'Zabat' and shows each woman as one of the nine Greek muses. The model here, Pat Agana, is represented as Euterpe, the muse of music, traditionally pictured holding a flute.\n\nMaud Sulter produced the Zabat series for Rochdale Art Gallery in 1989, the 150th anniversary of the invention of photography. It was a direct response to the lack of a black presence at other celebratory events and exhibitions. Here we see the conventions of Victorian portrait photography under the command of a black woman photographer. The backdrop, props and pose are all retained but the image is transformed with African clothes, non-European objects and, most importantly, by the resolute black woman at its centre.\n\nThe title 'Zabat' also signifies Maud Sulter's call for a repositioning of black women in the history of photography: the word describes an ancient ritual dance performed by women on occasions of power.",

The contrast between these anachronistic and aristocratic styles and the actual histories of her sitters is used to poetic effect and also raises questions about the nature of 'national' heritage.",
