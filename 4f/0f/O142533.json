By 1942 Stravinsky was an established composer living in Hollywood, and Balanchine was a well-known choreographer and the founder of the American School of Ballet. Stravinsky was commissioned to compose the music for the polka through Balanchine, both men having made their name working with Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in Paris. \n\nThe elephant ballet was performed during the 1942 season entitled Holidays, in New York's Madison Garden building where Barnum's circus had performed since 1881. The Ringlings had run the Ringling and the Barnum and Bailey shows as two separate units but combined them in 1919. Despite losing control of the syndicate in 1932 during the Depression, they regained control in 1938 under the management of John Ringling North, the nephew of John Ringling, who kept it going until the 1950s.",
