He gained experience from a young age as an illustrator by working for the 'Westminster Budget' and other magazines. He worked mainly as an illustrator to Children's books. From the early twentieth century Rackham developed a talent for portraying witches and fairies by employing vivid characterization, which often has an underlying sense of horror. These illustration effectively incorporate fine outlines with a pale palette to create the feeling of another world. \n\nMagical transformation is a common subject in fairy tales. The delicately tinted watercolour illustration to the  fairytale 'The Elder Mother Tree' (1845) by Hans Christian Anderson (1805-75) depicts the moment when the Elder Mother appears in an elderflower tree which sprouts from a teapot.Elder trees have long been associated with fairy mythology, and were thought to protect against evil spirits.",
