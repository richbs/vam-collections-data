Seven of Britain\u2019s leading artists were commissioned to produce posters. The posters were signed and published in a limited edition of 100.\nThis image shows the film actor John Wayne, known for playing cowboys and soldiers, wearing lipstick, a pacifist badge and a peace sign drawn on his cowboy hat. The words \u2018Peace is tough\u2019 are scribbled above him. Jamie Reid has subverted portraits of familiar figures before: he was responsible for the Sex Pistols record album cover on which appeared an image of the Queen defaced by lettering and a safety pin.",
