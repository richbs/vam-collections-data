Studied at RA Schools, won gold medal for historical painting (first awarded for 12 years) 1818. Exhibited 53 works at the RA between 1819 and 1857, and nine at the Br 1825-43: portraits, Italian genre, literary and biblical subjects. Most famous for his friendship with the poet John Keats, whom he accompanied to Italy 1820 and nursed until his death 1821. Lived mostly in Rome, appointed British Consul 1860-72. Died Rome 3 August 1879, eventually buried next to Keats. His children Arthur and Waiter Severn, and Ann Mary Newton, were also artists. \n\nLIT: W Sharp <u>The Life and Letters of Joseph Severn</u> 1892; S Birkenhead<u> Against Oblivion: The Life of Joseph Severn</u> 1943; S Birkenhead <u>Illustrious Friends: the story of Joseph Severn and his son Arthur </u>1965 \n\n\n<b>Ariel- 'Where the Bee Sucks\u2026' </b>\n1416-1869 Neg GA590 \nMillboard, 26.1 x 38.1 cm (10\u00bc X 15 ins) \nTownshend Bequest 1869 \n\nIncluded in the 1907 V&A catalogue with the title 'Nymph Gathering Honeysuckle', amended to the above by 1935. There seems little reason to doubt that the image is inspired by Ariel's song in act 5 scene 1 of Shakespeare's <i>The Tempest;</i> for other versions of this subject by Severn, see ('Ariel', 1410-1869, p26l). \nHowever, it is doubtful whether the present work can be identified with the painting exhibited at the RA in 1838; that picture was titled 'Ariel', with the quotation appended in the catalogue: \n\nWhere the bee sucks, there lurk I; \nIn a cowslip's bell I lie: \nThere I couch when owls do cry. \nOn the bat's back I do fly, \nAfter summer merrily. \n\nThe present work seems to show Ariel as described in the subsequent, unquoted couplet: 'Merrily, merrily shall I live now,/Under the blossom that hangs on the bough'. It might have been the work exhibited at the RA in 1836, simply titled 'Ariel'. \nSevern has taken the pose of Ariel directly from Michelangelo's figure of Eve tempted, on the Sistine Chapel ceiling, but in reverse; Sharp records Severn making copies there (pp166-7). \n\nEXH:  ?RA 1836 (228); <i>Bicentenary exhibition</i> 1768-1968 RA 1968 (235) \n\n\n\n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
