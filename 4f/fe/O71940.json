This particular image, intended as an illustration to Sir Thomas Malory's late-15th-century English epic romance, Morte d'Arthur, may, however, have a more personal meaning. It shows a lost man and a distant, unattainable woman. Jones had been engaged to Petra Gill, daughter of the sculptor Eric Gill, but she broke off the engagement in 1927, marrying someone else in 1930, the year this print was made. Jones's style is characterised by a linear quality, both in his prints and paintings.",

            "bibliography": "Timmers, Margaret (ed), <i>Impressions of the Twentieth Century: Fine Art Prints from the V&A's Collection</i>, London, V&A Publications, 2001\nThe full text of the entry is as follows: \n\n\"<b>David Jones (1895-1974)</b> \n\n<i>The Wounded Knight</i>, 1930 \n\nMany works by the Welsh artist and poet David Jones are richly layered with allusions to medieval legends.  Motifs from works such as Malory's Arthurian epic <i>Morte d'Arthur</i> and the Welsh <i>Y Gododdin</i> run like threads through his art and writings, bringing Jones's deeply felt consciousness of an age-old cultural inheritance into his response to the modern world, and showing in tragic juxtaposition the extent to which this continuum had bee broken by events of the twentieth century. \nIn this case Malory's work was itself the starting point: the print, intended as an illustration to the <i>Morte d'Arthur</i>, shows Jones's deeply personal response to Malory's work.  Through the simplified contours of the central figures the artist focuses on the points at which they touch; the viewer's sensory awareness is heightened by details such as the knight's hair against the lady's arm.  David Jones had been engaged to Eric Gill's daughter, Petra, but she broke off the engagement in 1927 and in 1930 married another man: the image of the knight lying wounded in his lady's arms and the way she sits up, unattainable, perhaps carry with them something of the shadow of this experience.  Certainly the wounded knight lying in the arms of his lady recalls <i>Piet\u00e0</i> images of Mary cradling Christ, an image central to Jones's strong Catholic faith. \nTwo years earlier Jones had begun the writings which became <i>In Parenthesis</i> (published 1937), a novel in prose and poetry about the experiences of a soldier in the First World War.  Jones had himself fought as a private with the Royal Welsh Fusiliers on the Western Front, and this had affected him profoundly.  <i>In Parenthesis</i> contains many allusions to the <i>Morte d'Arthur</i>.  The Great War had shattered the heroic ideal of medieval Romance, and Jones often ends quotations abruptly or literally breaks them up across the page.  In the book, too, soldiers are linked with Christ.  The frontispiece shows a soldier with his arms hung out as if on a cross, his helmet strap a kind of halo.  Men were no longer to be heroes of medieval chivalry; instead they were to be sent to their deaths, betrayed by their officers as Judas betrayed Christ.  And so, in this illustration of an Arthurian legend, we might likewise read echoes of the death of a soldier at the Somme, or perhaps the death of the chivalric ideal itself: riderless horses are scattered beside the shore as the sun sets on the Arthurian legend.\"",
