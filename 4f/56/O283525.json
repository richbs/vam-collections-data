The bi-injection, two-colour moulding system of the 'Nova' range was a new technique - previously only used in the automotive industry for moulding red, amber and clear plastic rear light covers. Innovative in design terms, all the decoration occurred during the manufacturing process. Though this type of plastic was comparatively expensive, it was very rigid and resistant to staining, with high thermal resistance and good colouring properties.\nDuring the 1960s a general fascination with new materials helped break down the traditional response to plastic as a cheap substitute for more luxury materials. Instead it was treated as a quality material in its own right. The 'Nova' range won the Duke of Edinburgh's Prize for Elegant Design in 1968. The judges especially commended the simplicity of production and the attempts to meet consumer requirements. Designs created an idea of the 1960s kitchen as a small area full of high-tech equipment. Modern-looking, space-saving, and stackable, 'Nova' appealed to designers as well as consumers. The range was retailed through image-conscious design stores like Habitat and Heal's.",
