The very early beads often had symbolic or amuletic value, and in some instances they were used as currency. The desire for beads as personal adornment is universal to all cultures and continues through to this day in a contemporary approach. \n\nRobert Ebendorf, an enthusiast for incorporating \u2018found objects\u2019, chose to make his beads of papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 from Chinese newspaper and gold foil. Ebendorf\u2019s dyslexia forms part of the inspiration, he is more fascinated by the visual patterns words can produce, rather than their meanings.  \n\nRobert Ebendorf\u2019s early work followed Scandinavian aesthetics, as he returned again and again to Norway where he had his first training as a metalsmith. By the mid-sixties though he began to construct his jewellery from found objects, and is renowned for his collages.",
