Such tiles appear regularly  in houses decorated in the Arts and Crafts style, and were used widely by exponents of vernacular architecture such as Richard Norman Shaw (1831-1912). The most common setting for such tiles was in and around the fireplace.\n\nCommissions\nThis panel, depicting the story of Sleeping Beauty, is inscribed 'of a certain prince who delivered a King's daughter from a sleep of a hundred years, wherein she and all hers had been cast by enchantment'. It is one of three narrative panels, produced as overmantels for bedrooms, that were ordered from Morris & Co. in 1862 along with stained glass and other tiles and furnishings, by the painter Myles Birket Foster. The various items were destined for Foster's new house, The Hill, at Witley, Surrey, where the artist was a neighbour of Henry Cole (1808-1882), first Director of the Victoria and Albert Museum. The additional two panels depicted Beauty and the Beast and Cinderella.",
