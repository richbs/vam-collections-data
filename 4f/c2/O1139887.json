To celebrate the line's 10-year anniversary, Longchamp asked artist Tracey Emin to collaborate on a collection. Emin\u2019s art is highly confessional and draws upon her life experiences in a variety of media that  include story-telling, drawing, filmmaking, installation, painting, neon, photography and appliqu\u00e9d textiles. Emin included some of her favoured techniques to create the Longchamp line, including destruction and reconstruction of textiles, patchwork, embroidery and painting. \n\nEmin\u2019s Longchamp bags were linked to a narrative she had crafted. In Emin\u2019s story, an \u2018International Woman\u2019 travelled from one city to another, in search of an \u2018International Love\u2019 with an \u2018International Man\u2019. \n\nLongchamp produced this suitcase in a limited edition of two hundred, each with a personal connection to the artist. Each copy carried a rosette upon which Emin drew the Longchamp logo. Each rosette also included a handwritten name of a street, city, or hotel which reminded the artist of a romantic moment or encounter from her own life. This bag's location of inspiration was Canterbury.",
