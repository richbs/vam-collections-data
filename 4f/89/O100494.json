            "public_access_description": "The Vincennes factory had a connection to the French crown from its inception as it was established in 1740 in the semi-abandoned royal fortress of the Ch\u00e2teau de Vincennes to the east of Paris.  There, a handful of porcelain specialists were inspired to start experimenting with porcelain as huge prices were paid by wealthy aristocrats for this glassy white substance which had for the most part had to be imported from East Asia or from the Meissen factory in what is now Germany.  It was the Saxon ruler Augustus the Strong who had led the drive in Europe to emulate Chinese porcelains and his factory was established in about 1710. During the early 1740s the majority of the Vincennes factory's products were probably experimental as the porcelain body was still being perfected and different enamel colours were slowly invented.  In 1745 however, they secured a royal privil\u00e8ge which granted them the exclusive right to produce porcelain in Meissen style in France.  By the late 1740s their products were already accomplished with a wide range of enamel colours in use, followed from 1748 by gilding and ground colours from 1752 onwards.  \n\nThe fashion for small figure sculptures had developed in the 17th century when they were made of sugar and placed in groups on courtly dining tables.  When the sculptor Johann Joachim Kaendler arrived at the Meissen factory in 1731 he revolutionised this fashion by producing an extraordinary range of figure models in white and coloured porcelain.  These soon became desirable furnishing objects in their own right and were often fitted with gilt bronze mounts or incorporated into other objects such as clocks or candlesticks.  This allegorical figure was made at the Vincennes factory very much in the Meissen baroque style.  France is personified by a female figure wearing armour and a plumed helmet, similar to classical figures of the goddess of War, (Athena or Minerva),  with on her shield the three  fleur de lys for the French king, Louis XV.  The sculptor responsible for this model, and its companion 'France as Peace' (see C.330-1919), is unknown.",

            "history_note": "Tamara Pr\u00e9aud includes a wide range of Vincennes figures in her 1991 publication (see below).  The Leda group at S\u00e8vres in the Mus\u00e9e National de C\u00e9ramique, cat. no. 94, p. 144 has a similar treatment of the base as this figure with jumbled striated and honeycombed rocks.  The modelling and pose of the figure also has some similarities although there is nothing conclusive to prove it is by the same hand.  The Leda figure is documented as being by Depierreux who worked at the factory from 1746-1749. (In her Liste du Personnel de la Manufacture de Vincennes she suggests on p. 205 this is Jean-Joseph de Pierreux 'apprentif de l'Acad\u00e9mie de peinture et sculpture a Paris, el\u00e8ve de M. Slodtz'. In the S\u00e8vres Workmen's List on the French Porcelain Society website he is given as Jean Jacques Depierreux with the same working dates at the factory.)  Thirteen of each large and small Leda figures were in the <i>magasin de vente</i> in 1752 for sale at 24 and 10<i> livres</i> respectively.  It is interesting there were nine figures of France in the shop in the same year.\nMme. Pr\u00e9aud states that Depierreux was very active during his short time at the factory and was paid for numerous models, among others six figures of <i>Dieux</i>, and was paid either monthly or according to the models he produced.\nFor a corresponding figure of Peace see C.330-1909.  This featured in the 1978 Vincennes exhibition catalogue by Tamara Pr\u00e9aud, no. 483, p. 166.  9 examples were in the magasin de vente in 1752 priced at 20 livres each.\n\nAcquisition type: Purchase",
