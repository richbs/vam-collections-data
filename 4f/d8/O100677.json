The greater part of the back is brocaded with a key-and-lozenge pattern, in pink and brown, on a white ground. The embroidery, in pink and dark-brown, is on the long wide sleeves and forms a more elaborate geometrical pattern of closely set lozenges with four-petalled blossoms at the points of junction. The applied cotton strips, in buff and dark-blue, are above and below the embroidery. Those in dark-blue have a petal pattern formed of applied pieces of coarse white cotton. There is a square-cut falling 'sailor' collar composed of strips of coarse cloth in buff and two shades of dark-blue.",
