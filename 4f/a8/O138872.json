As she describes it: 'Blair experiences minor heart trouble and appears to be showing the strain of mounting criticism, although he remains as zealous and unrepentant as ever about his decision to go to war. His trip to Ulster is overshadowed by persistent questions about Iraq.'\n\n'Marf' drew daily topical cartoons for the Evening Standard between March 2002 and August 2005, moving to the Londoner's Diary page in August 2003. The drawings cover key political and social issues of the period, providing a vivid and often hilarious response to the main news of the day. The Evening Standard is London's only evening newspaper, publishing up to five editions a day. In Marf's own words: 'The cartoonist needs to keep up with the rapid pace of event.'",
