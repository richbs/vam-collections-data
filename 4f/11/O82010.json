            "historical_context_note": "In early 2005, a number of short field trips were undertaken by individual curators to Istanbul, Cairo and Morocco. ... In Morocco, Mariam Rosser-Owen carried out more sustained research on six sections of a wooden calligraphic frieze in the V&A\u2019s collection (illus. 5.11). Panels of this type have been described at various times as Moroccan, Spanish, Syrian, and Egyptian, but initial research pointed to Morocco as their most likely provenance, since inscribed woodwork is a key feature in religious architecture there. \n\nParallels, at least in terms of the Kufic style of script employed, were indeed found in the carved woodwork on monuments of the early fourteenth century in Fez. One example is the Funduq al-Tastawniyyin, which provided lodgings and a place of business for merchants from Tetouan (illus. 3.27). The background decoration in these fourteenth-century examples was, though, much more elaborate and much denser. The same was true of the Kufic inscriptions in stucco and cut tile-work on 14th-century buildings of Fez. It was therefore necessary to find earlier parallels, from the Almoravid and Almohad periods (1055\u20131147 and 1147\u20131269 respectively), of which the Almohad city gates still standing in Marrakesh and Rabat are a magnificent example. These were built between 1150 and 1200 and feature long Kufic inscriptions that form the three sides of a square frame around the gates\u2019 main arch (illus.3.28). The form of the script and the sober use of simple floral motifs provide the closest parallel to the design of the V&A\u2019s wooden beams. These can therefore be attributed to Morocco in the Almohad period.\n\nResearch by Mariam Rosser-Owen reported in Tim Stanley, \"The Concept of the Jameel Gallery\", in <i>The Making of the Jameel Gallery of Islamic Art at the Victoria and Albert Museum</i>, edited by Rosemary Crill and Tim Stanley, London: V&A Publications, 2006, pp.70-73.\n\nComparative material:\n\nThe David Collection in Copenhagen has a panel identical to these, in terms of their dimensions, the calligraphic style of the inscription, the carving of the floral scrolls in the background, and the colouration of the whole in red, green and white paint. It would not be surprising if they came from the same monument. The David Collection panel is accession number D12/1986, and is published in Kjeld von Folsach, <i>Art from the World of Islam, in The David Collection</i> (Copenhagen, 2001): cat.no.430, p.268. Its caption is: \"Panel, wood, carved and painted. H: 17; W: 103 cm. North Africa or Syria, 12th century\".\n\nTwo very closely related panels have recently been sold at Christie's, St James's, London: the first on Tuesday 23 April 2002, and the second (in two pieces) on Tuesday 29 April 2003. These panels are contiguous, though they were sold at separate sales (the panel sold in 2002 immediately precedes that sold in 2003). They have the same calligraphy, though the uprights of the letters are more elongated, and the same scolling floral motifs in the background. They are much larger however: the dimensions of the 2003 panel are H: 27 x L: 314 cm. The catalogue article relates the particular bifurcating leaf and bud motif on the beams in the V&A and the David Collection to the decoration of monuments in Spain and North Africa (the Maghreb), mostly from the Almoravid and Almohad period, but also continuing into the Nasrid and Marinid periods. For example, they are found in the inlay on the steps of the minbar in the Kutubiyyah mosque in Marrakesh, on the great Almohad gates in Rabat and Marrakesh, and on the spandrels of the Sal\u00f3n de Comares in the Alhambra.\n\nUnlike those in the V&A and David Collection, the Christie's beams are interesting in that they have a poetic inscription rather than verses from the Qur'an - the text is a pre-Islamic <i>qasida</i> called <i>Lamiyyat al-'Arab</i> by the poet al-Samwal Gharid ibn 'Adiya' al-Azdi, who died about AD 560. The text of the panel sold in 2003 reads: \n\"...long... And we are people who see not killing as a disgrace\nWhenever (we) saw (the tribe of) 'Amir and Salul\nThe love of death brings close the appointed time of death) to us\nAnd the dislike of (the love of death) makes their time of death lengthened\".\n\nMariam Rosser-Owen\n\nThese beams, of which the V&A has six in its collection, have inscriptions from the Qur\u2019an carved in high relief in an elegant version of 'foliated Kufic' script, and a background decoration in a much lower relief, which is covered in gesso and painted in green, red and white paint. This style of inscription, as well as the particular form of the scrolling leaf and bud motif in the background, is seen on many monuments still standing in Spain and Morocco, dating mainly from the Almoravid (ca. 1062-1150) and Almohad periods (1150-1269). \n\nThe use of verses from the Qur\u2019an in the inscriptions on these beams suggests they originally formed part of the decoration of a religious foundation, such as a mosque or madrasah. They were probably part of a continuous frieze of Qur\u2019anic quotations. Such friezes often ran around the tops of walls. This is the arrangement, for example, in the Dome of the Rock (Jerusalem), the Great Mosque of C\u00f3rdoba, and in the Mosque of Ibn Tulun in Cairo, where a wooden frieze similar to these originally ran to a length of over 2 km.\n\nMariam Rosser-Owen",
