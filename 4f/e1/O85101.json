They were preserved in imperial tombs where, in accordance with Ottoman custom, they were placed over the graves of the deceased. \n\nThis kaftan may have come from one of the graves of the 19 younger sons of Sultan Murat III. They were executed at the succession of their half-brother, Mehmet III, in 1595. This gory practice, designed to avoid a struggle for the succession, was never repeated.\n\nThe pairs of wavy lines represent the pelts of the striped tiger. In the Islamic world, this design acquired powerful associations. The Iranian hero Rustam, for example, is usually depicted wearing a tiger-skin coat. By 1500 the motif was popular on Ottoman Turkish textiles.",
