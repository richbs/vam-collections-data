Both are spare, elegant and influenced by Art Deco Parisian furniture of the 1920s.  The angled top of the central mirror panel echoes the shape of the dressing table's stretchers.  Even though they do not have frames, the three mirror panels are backed with mahogany. The same wood is also used for the carved ball feet on which they stand. \n\nSimple geometric forms and luxurious materials were typical of furniture by Emile-Jacques Ruhlmann, the most influential French cabinetmaker of the 1920s. His work undoubtedly inspired this mirror, which was probably designed by J.F. Johnson who worked for Heal & Son in London.",
