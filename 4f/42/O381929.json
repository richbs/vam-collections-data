Tribal peoples, such as the Bedouin, usually wore stiff circular or penannular bracelets.  Flexible bracelets, like this one, were commoner among urban women.  \n\nThis pattern, with hollow domes forming a kind of flexible chain, was popular throughout the region.  Bracelets where the domes are linked by stiff rods, as here, were a speciality of Palestine.  The name, swar habbayat, means \u2018little seeds\u2019.
