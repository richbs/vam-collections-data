Clara Bell was the sister of Sir Edward Poynter and the jewel was commissioned from Giuliano between 1895 and 1912 by her son C. F. Bell, keeper of Fine Arts at the Ashmolean Museum.  The diamonds were booty resulting from the victory at Seringapatam in 1799 taken by General Robert Bell, Clara Bell's grandfather-in-law.  The General, then Major Bell, of the Madras Artillery, led the attack into the assualt on the breech and was shown in the painting 'The Storming of Seringapatam' by Sir Robert Ker Porter, reproduced in stipple engraving with accompanying key by J. Vendramini, and published in 1802.' (Gere and Munn, p. 86).",
