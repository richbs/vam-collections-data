So-called Zwischengoldglas was very difficult and time consuming to make and therefore extremely expensive. The glass makers carefully ground and polished two glass cups, so that the inner cup would fit exactly into the outer. They covered the inside of the outer cup with gold leaf, which they then engraved with a design. The inner cup was gilded on the outside then painted over with marbling. After decoration, the glass maker would stick the two cups together and carefully seal them at the top to make them waterproof and fit for use. This technique correspond to instructions given in the \"Ars Vitraria Experimentalis\", Johann Kunckel's celebrated treatise on glassmaking of 1679. A number of glasses with this decoration survive, and the group has recently been attributed to Dresden in Saxony.",
