His hair is dressed high (jata makuta) and decked with the cobra, half-moon and Datura flower and ornamented with tiaras. At the back of the head there is a wheel-like siras cakra (disc for hanging garlands). His costume consists of  tiger-skin drawers worn with girdle and sash. Other details include sacred cord, waistband, garlands on the shoulders, keyura armlets of spiral design, elbow bracelets, and ear ornaments (patra kundala on the left, makara kundala on the right).\nParvati sits half-inclined towards Siva with the left leg pendent, holding a lotus-bud in her right hand; her left hand in varada mudra. She wears a seven tiered coronet (karanda makuta), and her lower garment is diapered. Other details include makara-kundala ear pendants and keyura armlets.\nSkanda is depicted as a child naked except for a channavira-type harness and a light girdle which leaves the genitals exposed. He also wears a karanda-type coronet and holds a lotus-bud in each hand. The three figures rest on a rectangular base with upright projections for the support of an arched-surround (torana) and rings for processional carrying.",

This subject was especially popular in shrines of the Pallava period (about 300-888 AD) and continued into the Chola period (about 850-1267 AD) in processional icons. \n\nHere the figures rest on a rectangular base with upright projections for the support of an arched-surround (\u2018prabha\u2019) and rings for securing the image with cord during processional use. Both figures have a  projecting disc (\u2018sirascakra\u2019) at the back of the head. This was used for hanging garlands during pujas (worship) and processions.\n\nShiva sits majestically erect, displaying four arms. An antelope leaping from the upper left arm has turned its head to look at Pasupati, \u2018Lord of the Animals\u2019. The upper right hand has an axe (\u2018parasu\u2019), similarly poised. The lower left is in \u2018vitarka-mudra\u2019, denoting Shiva as the expounder of subtle knowledge. The lower right hand is held in \u2018abhaya-mudra\u2019, bestowing protection. \n\nHis ear-ornaments are characteristically distinctive. The circular ear-lobe plug (\u2018patra kundala\u2019) on the left and the pendant \u2018makara kundala\u2019 on the right emphasise his dual nature. Parvati sits inclined towards Shiva, holding a lotus-bud in her right hand, while her left hand bestows grace (\u2018varada-mudra\u2019).",
