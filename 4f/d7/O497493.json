            "physical_description": "Vase, light-coloured bronze, mottled with small ring handles. In the style of bronze of the Ming dynasty.\nResearch by Maria Fabrizi \u2013 Feb. 1988: This vase was bought in Paris, and is probably Japanese (R.K.). It is one of a number of objects analysed by spectrographic methods, in Oxford, in about 1960. The drill-hole seems to have been in the underside of the base. The results showed that it was an alloy of copper and zinc, with a small amount of lead and a very tiny tin content. The general level of impurities was low. The Vase is rather pear-shaped, with a slightly flared base, and a narrow but slightly flared neck. It has a tarnished yellow exterior, and a brown base plate. The base plate has probably been soldered-in, and seems to have been coloured with paint or lacquer. There are beast and loop handles, with free-moving plain rings suspended from them. The rings seem to be made in one piece. The general appearance of the exterior is of etched metal that may have been coated or lacquered. The handles are blackish, and show signs of abrasion, although not of corrosion. The interior does not show much corrosion either, but merely a small amount of thinly distributed green products in the neck. The inside of the neck has reddish and black patches, whereas the rest of the interior does not seem to.\nAnalyses of the body and base were carried out by non-intrusive EDXRF methods. The results showed that the base and body had quite different compositions. The body had about 29%zinc, whereas the base plate had about 50%zinc. There is no doubt that the base plate could only have been made using metallic zinc, but it could be a replacement, so this is mot very helpful information. The body has a composition that could be made easily using metallic zinc. Under perfect conditions, this zinc content could be obtained using the cementation process, but the usual zinc content would be 28% or less under normal conditions and some zinc would be lost from the brass when melted for casting or refining. The very small lead and tin value seem to suggest that these elements were not added deliberately. Both base plate and body had small iron, nickel, and silver impurities. The body compositions closely resembles that of a number of censers, such as M.734-1910 and M.1165-1926. The base composition does not have any parallels in the objects analysed so far in the collection.",
