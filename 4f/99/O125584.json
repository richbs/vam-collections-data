Jenkins, 1867\n\nHistorical significance: This half length portrait shows a clean shaven man with long hair turning three quarters and looking directly out at the viewer. He wears a broad white collar which is tied in front with a tasselled cord and a plain dark coat. To the left above the sitter's head is the inscription \"JOHANNES MILTON\" which is continued with \"AET ANO 42 1650\" on the right. \n\nFollowing an examination of the painting in 1918 Mr. Kendrick concluded that the painting was from the seventeenth century but that the inscription had been added at a later date. The title of the painting was subsequently changed to <i>A man unknown. Inscribed Johannes Milton</i>.\n\nThe composition of the sitter in this three-quarter portrait turning and looking out at us closely follows that of the print by William Faithorne dated 1670 showing the John Milton at the age of 62, a copy of which is in the V&A collections (accession number 24680). In both these works the sitter is shown with the same broad white collar. The way that the collar turns up at the centre of the left piece and the cord falls in a bow behind its tasselled ends is strikingly similar to that of Milton's dress in the engraving by Fairthorne. The sitter in 30-1867 looks younger than that in the engraving. Although he has the same wide set eyes in dark arched eyebrows and long nose his mouth seems wider than that in the print. Considering the popularity of John Milton it is possible that the artist copied this printed source for a likeness of the poet. The face of the sitter looks younger, suggesting that the artist made these changes to create a portrait of the poet as a younger man, supported by the inscription.\n\nJohn Milton (1608-1674) was a poet, author, polemicist and civil servant for the Commonwealth of England (1649-1660). Born in London, he studied in Cambridge. Milton is best known for his epic poem <u>Paradise Lost</u> (completed in 1658-63). Written in blank verse, the work tells the Christian story of the Fall of Man. It was first published in ten volumes in 1667. His work often reflects the contemporary political and religious unrest in England. Milton wrote in English, Italian and Latin and enjoyed an international reputation. In the years following his death, the reputation of Milton oscillated and he is still regarded as one of the key figures in British literature. It is therefore not surprising that this portrait is by an artist after a print that was produced during the poet's lifetime.",
