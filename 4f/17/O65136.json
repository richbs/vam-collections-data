A constant supply of fashionable new designs from which to create new lines was required, so patternmakers and master weavers like Leman supplied a wide range of designs for different weavers. The album contains some of his work from the period 1706-1716, as well as five designs from the 1730s.\n\nThis design was drawn by James Leman from one of Christopher Baudouin's. Baudouin was born about 1665. He was a Hugenot refugee, possibly from Tours, and was active in London from the 1680s, being naturalized in 1709. He lived in Paternoster Row in Spitalfields in London. Baudouin produced designs for James Leman who was born in 1688 into a weaving family of Huguenot descent. \n\nIn 1702 James Leman was apprenticed to his father, Peter, and lived with his family in Stewart Street, Spitalfields in London. Leman's inscription on this design reveals that it was commissioned by Mr Matthew Vernon, a mercer who commissioned two designs from Leman between 1707 and 1726.",
