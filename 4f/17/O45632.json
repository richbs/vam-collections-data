The \u2018original\u2019 for these copies was a damaged portrait miniature that belonged to the Duke of Hamilton. This was believed to be of Mary Queen of Scots. It was restored by the miniature painter Peter Cross (about 1645-1724) according to prevailing ideas of female beauty, but it bore little resemblance to the queen\u2019s actual portrait. This image was reproduced in prints at the time and Bernard Lens painted many versions in miniature, such as this one. The costume worn by this unknown woman is in fact similar to costumes depicted in miniatures from the 1560s painted by Levina Teerlinc. She worked at the court of Elizabeth I.",
