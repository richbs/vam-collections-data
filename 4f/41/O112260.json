The designer, George Richardson, was a distinguished architect, mainly working in the classical style. He toured France and Italy in his youth, and was influenced by the classical designs he saw on his travels. Richardson was particularly known for his ceilings and chimneypieces, and numbers of his chimneypiece designs can still be found in town and country houses, mostly executed in marble. \n\nThe capital in this print is not from the five regular orders of classical architecture, but it is derived from those on the \u2018Tower of the Winds\u2019 in Athens, from about 40 BC The tower, an octagonal marble edifice, is overlooked by the Acropolis, and has figures of the eight winds carved on each side.",
