Chorister in Chapel Royal, entered RA Schools 1821, winning gold medal 1824. In a long and successful career, exhibited 83 works at the RA between 1823 and 1879, 39 at the BI 1824-44, and eight at the SBA 1825-34. Early pictures were portraits and historical subjects, but following success of 'Rebels Shooting a Prisoner' (showing children at play) 1827, specialised in similar scenes, and of school and village life, comparable to those of Wilkie and Mulready. Influential and much admired, they became popular through engravings. Elected  ARA 1840, RA 1846, and Honorary Retired RA 1876. \nContributed illustrations to the Etching Club's 'Deserted Village', 'Songs of Shakespeare' and 'Etch'd Thoughts' (1841-4). Moved to Cranbrook, Kent, 1856; senior member of the Cranbrook Colony of painters. Died Cranbrook 23 September 1886; his studio sale was at Christie's 21 May 1887. \nLIT: Art Journal 1855, pp293-6, 1862, p138, 1866, pp40, 330, 1886 \npp351-2 (obit); Athenaeum 2 October 1886, p439 (obit); The Times 24 September 1886 (obit); DNB\nReading the Scriptures\n FA224 Neg 63518 \nPanel, 40.6 X 35.5 cm (16 X 14 ins) Signed 'T. Webster' on stool cr Sheepshanks Gift 1857 \nWebster exhibited two paintings with this title at the BI in 1835, their sizes (including frames) given in the catalogue as 27 by 24 inches (no 22) and 30 by 46 inches (no 431). The present work is presumably the former. The critic of the Examiner noted it as 'a simple and pleasing thing - and the same title is attached by Mr Webster to another and very different production, which will also be found here. That which we have just noticed (22) shows a child spelling out of the bible at its grandmother's knee'. The facial features of the grandmother are very similar to the various 'portraits' of'Rembrandt's mother', for example that in the Mauritshuis, The Hague. \n \nEXH: BI 1835 (22); Victorian Narrative Paintings V&A Circulation \nexhibition 1961 \nLIT: \tExaminer 1835, p180 \n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
