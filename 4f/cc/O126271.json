The basic form of the table knife, a single-edged blade more or less pointed, with a handle, has remained virtually the same since Antiquity, although the details of construction, shape and decoration have varied.\n\nOwning fine cutlery in the 16th century was an outward sign of wealth, elegance and refinement. It was normal practice for everyone to carry their own cutlery, especially a knife, in a leather case. Cutlery remained individual and personalised. \n\nThis knife handle is made of rock crystal, a pure silica or quartz in a transparent and colourless form that can be cut into finely defined shapes. Many pieces of cutlery made of precious materials survive suggesting they were not used much but were treasured. The two notches on the blade of this knife suggest it was once No. 2 in a set. Sets of knives were still relatively unusual in the mid-16th century. They were often stored in leather cases or in cutlery cabinets for use on special occasions.\n\nThe survival rate also suggests that knives were not subjected to hard, repeated use. Although this knife is sharply pointed to enable it both to cut and skewer meat, fingers were used for much of the meal.",
