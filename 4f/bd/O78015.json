Alternatively, it may once have been part of a set of silver tea equipment which normally consisted of a teapot, a coffee pot, a cream jug and a sugar basin.\n\nTime\nAlthough based upon 18th-century Rococo design, as in the  scroll and shell ornament, the style of this jug  demonstrates the 19th century's preference for bulging, curved sinuous forms. In terms of  sheer quantity of production the Rococo Revival was the most popular 19th-century style, particularly in  commercial silver. It was the earliest of the  stylistic revivals and from its first emergence in the 1820s and 1830s its inspiration was drawn largely from France.\n\nManufacturer\nThe jug was made by the inventive silversmith, Benjamin Smith lll. He came from a silversmithing background and during his career worked on pioneering projects such as the Summerley's Art Manufacturers design reform venture organised by Henry Cole, the first Director of the V&A.",
