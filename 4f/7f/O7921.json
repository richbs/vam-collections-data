On the reverse, peaches and two bats and on one shoulder rocks, on the other finger citron, also known  as 'Buddha's hand citron'. \nThere is a border of palmate leaves around the neck and rocks around the base.\nThe two-part flat-topped stopper is made of yellow glass and glass coloured pink to imitate rose quartz.\nThe base is formed by the blue glass overlay and there is a shallow curved indentation underneath without a foot.\nThe peaches, bats and pomegranites are red to emphasise their auspicious character, the finger citron yellow, its natural colour, and the palmate border on the neck and the rocks on the are shoulder white.\nPomegranites, peaches and finger citron were frequently depicted together to form a group of auspicious symbols known as the 'Three Abundances': of fertility, happiness and longevity (Cammann, 1962, pp. 112-114). The colours and carving of the overlays are harmonious and attractive.",

The habit of snuff-taking spread to China from the West during the 17th century and became established in the 18th century. People generally carried snuff in a small bottle. By the 20th century these bottles had become collectors' items, owing to the great variety of materials and decorative techniques used in their production.",
