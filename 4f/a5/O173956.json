The image of Cash's chimney is also in the collection of the Royal Commission on Historic Monuments. The True to Scale printing process is similar to collotype but depends on a reaction between the blueprint and gelatin solution, rather than the use of light-sensitised gelatin. According to the artist it produces very high quality images at a relatively low cost which have a good record for stability. It was provided by a number of firms who supply office equipment and reprographic services but is no longer available in this country as the use of an essential ingredient, ox gall, is against Common Market regulations. Three companies who used to provide it were Entwistle Thorpe Ltd., Manchester, Hodges Bennett & Co. Ltd., London, and Colyer & Southey, London [see Index of Printers].",
