            "public_access_description": "Basins were important items for hygiene in the Middle Ages. Contemporary images show us that diners would wash their hands before and during meals. Decorated basins, such as this one, would hold floral and herbal scented water.\n\nThe decoration on this bowl is simple but elegantly painted to fit the concave structure. Images of fish were common in both the Middle East and in the West.\n\nBasins with similar decoration have been attributed to ceramic production centres in Orvieto, in the Umbrian region of Italy. Documentary evidence informs us that Orivieto was a production centre from the 13th century. Ceramic manufacture here began to decline in the latter part of the 14th century as it was badly affected by the ravages of the Black Death. \n\nThis basin was said to have been found in Orvieto.In the late 19th and early 20th cetnries, the Italian government was investing in the redevelopment of towns such as Orivieto. A large number of medieval ceramics were discovered in the old water systems of the town such as in wells. Accurate dating of these ceramics was not possible but more recent excavations enable us to date these ceramics more precisely.\n\nGreen and brown decoration seems to have been characteristic of Orivieto production from its beginnings in the middle of the 13th century and into the 15th century. This simple colour scheme is also found in Tuscany, Liguria, and other centres bordering on the western Mediterranean in France and in Spain. Availibility of colouring agents and the popularity of this colour scheme influenced its spread and longevity.",
