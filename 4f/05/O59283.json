            "public_access_description": "Most costume designs show a single costume, which means that it can be difficult to visualise what it would look like on stage as one among many.  Alix Stone would often draw groups of characters together, so that everyone could see the place of each design in the overall scheme.   This was particularly important when designing opera, where the chorus usually works as a unit as well as individuals.\nDesigning everyday working clothes is perhaps more difficult than recreating period clothes.  There is a danger of overall drabness or similarity of style.  This is especially true in an opera like Peter Grimes, set in a Suffolk fishing village, where most men would wear traditional gurnsey sweaters and rubber boots, but there is also a number of tradesmen which help give a visual variety to the scene.  Drawing groups again ensures that there is a  sufficient varied look to the ensemble.",

The design was executed for a production of  Benjamin Britten's opera \"Peter Grimes\", performed by Scottish Opera at the Edinburgh King's Theatre, August 19th 1968.  The libretto by Montagu Slater is based on George Crabbe's poem \"The Borough\".  The production was conducted by Alexander Gibson; directed by Colin Graham; and lit by Charles Bristow.  The cast included Richard Cassilly as Peter and Phyllis Curtin as Ellen Orford.\n\nThe production was later revived by Scottish Opera in the springs of 1973 and 1980, and by English National Opera North in the spring of 1979.",
