The present piece is probably the model for a marble bust of Boydell originally in the Church of St Olave's Jewry, London. The Church was demolished in 1888, and the bust was subsequently removed to the Church of St Margaret's, Lothbury. Boydell was a print-seller and engraver and patron of the arts.\n\nThomas Banks (1735-1805) was apprenticed to a London mason, but also spent time working alongside the sculptor Peter Scheemakers (1691-1781). He enrolled in the life classes held at the St Martin's Lane Academy, and later at the Royal Academy Schools. In 1772 he became the first sculptor to win the Royal Academy's three-year travelling stipend, and went with his wife to Rome, where he eventually spent seven years. He specialised in ideal works, most of which were executed in Rome for British patrons, although he continued to produce similar work after his return to London. He was made a Royal Academician in 1786. Banks was one of the most original British Neo-classical sculptors, who dedicated his work to the antique spirit rather than to the fashionable classical style alone.. He tried to establish a market for modern gallery sculpture , which was particular for most patrons at the time preferred restored antique marbles, replicas, pastiches, busts and memorials.",

Miss Bacon was apparently a descendant- possibly the great-granddaughter of the sculptor John Bacon the Elder. Fifty-four drawings for monuments by John Bacon the Elder and John Bacon the Younger were also purchased from Miss Bacon at this time; the total price of \u00a345 included the two busts. The drawings are held in the department of Prints, Drawings and Paintings. A collection of sculptor's tools previously belonging the Bacon the Elder was given by the great-great-great granddaughter of the sculptor in 1998.",
