            "public_access_description": "Nigerian photographer J.D. 'Okhai Ojeikere (1930-2014) is best known for his photographs documenting a range of traditional and modern hairstyles worn by Nigerian women. He began the series in 1968 while travelling across the country with the Nigerian Arts Council, which was established to promote national culture following Nigerian independence from British colonial rule in 1960. \n\nThe hairstyles documented include both popular and ceremonial styles. Some of the more everyday styles, such as the pineapple hairstyle worn for casual events and office work, reflect the shift towards modern living taking place in Nigeria. The style has a number of variations, but all of them feature the distinctive pod pattern similar to a pineapple skin. \n\nOver the course of his life Ojeikere recorded almost a thousand hairstyles, each photographed using the same format. He always included a close range rear view perspective, which illustrated his belief that the styles were \u2018sculptures for a day\u2019. The series is of historic and anthropological significance, as well as aesthetic value.\n\nThe V&amp;A acquired eight photographs by J.D. 'Okhai Ojeikere documenting hairstyles and headties as part of the Staying Power project. Staying Power is a five year partnership between the V&amp;A and Black Cultural Archives. The project aims to explore black British experience from the 1950s to the 1990s through photographs acquired by the V&amp;A and oral histories conducted by Black Cultural Archives.",
