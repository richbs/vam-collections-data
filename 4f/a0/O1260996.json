The terms of the brief are set out below.\n\nCommission from Miriam Hanid\n\nDesigner\u2019s Brief\n\nThe Scope. \n\nThe purpose of this commission is to provide a contemporary, companion piece to the \u201cDolphin\u201d basin (M.1-1948), executed by the Utrecht goldsmith, Christiaen van Vianen in 1635 while he was resident in London and working for the court of Charles 1.  \n\nThe basin has a raised, wavy undulating rim in the form of two dolphins, the heads of which come together on one of the shorter sides, water appearing to stream from them into the dish.  Among the waves on the bottom can be seen a dolphin pouncing on a smaller fish.  This dish, raised and chased from a single sheet of silver relies on contrasting burnished and matted areas to add to the illusion of rippling water.  \n\nThe Design.\n\nThis basin would initially have been accompanied by a ewer, now long since lost.  It is not the intention of this commission to replicate this missing ewer.  Rather, we wish to see a design and ultimately a piece of silver which uses the van Vianen \u201cDolphin\u201d basin as a departure point.  The result should incorporate the associated qualities inherent in the van Vianen design; a sculptural quality with a sense of movement, fluidity, and vitality.  How this is interpreted in a three dimensional form is at the discretion of the silversmith, Miriam Hanid.  The van Vianen basin is a masterpiece of technical virtuosity, particularly in its use of chased decoration and it is expected that this new commission will reflect this and show chased decoration to its full advantage.\n\nThis commission is also intended to illustrate the transitory nature of historic, English silver.  Silver was often melted down, either to be remade in a newly fashionable style or for its bullion value to discharge a debt. Early Stuart silver in England during the latter reign of Charles 1 was sequestered by the King and melted to pay for the ultimately futile Royalist cause.  This commission will initially be displayed in the same area as the van Vianen \u201cDolphin\u201d basin in the Tudor, Stuart and the Russian Tsars exhibition to provide a contrast to the remarkable survival of the early Stuart silver from the Moscow Kremlin Museum.  \n.\nMaterials. \n\nThe material is to be of silver of appropriate gauge and weight.  The finish is to be of a uniformly high standard.\n\nApproval.  \n\nDesigns are to be submitted for consideration by representatives of the Victoria and Albert Museum, Tessa Murdoch and Eric Turner.  From the proposals submitted, the silversmith, Miriam Hanid, will be asked to work on a final design and proceed with manufacture.",
