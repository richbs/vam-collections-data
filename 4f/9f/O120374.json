The markings on the mount are an indication of the history of the object, its movement through the museum and the way it is categorised.\nThe mount is green and has a lable with the title on the right hand side.\n\nHistorical significance: Like many of the buildings at Fatehpur Sikri, the building on the right has over the years been ascribed different functions. Inside it has an intricately carved  central pillar which is topped by an elaborate capital which supports a circular platform. This is linked by four bridges to the corners of the room. This central feature dominates the building and is the source of the various functions ascribed to the structure. Commonly known as the Diwan-i-Khass, the hall of private audience, Akbar would have sat high up on the circular platform and addressed his ministers down below. Rizvi believes that the building could have been a jewel house where the emperor sat on the platform and inspected his storehouse of gems down below. Nath takes the view that the building is a symbolic representation of Akbar\u2019s belief in the cult of the sun. \n\nHowever, because of the difficulty/impracticalities  of actually sitting on the platform \u2013 a small cramped space and having to turn round to see people behind you, it is now thought that this building cannot be the Diwan-i-Khass. \n\nOn the left hand side are the buildings popularly known as the Ankh Michauli and the \u2018Astrologer\u2019s Seat\u2019. The Ankh Michauli (blind man\u2019s buff house) is the larger building at the back and is romantically described as the place where Akbar played hide and seek with the women of his harem. Nath  believes it to be the Diwan-I-Khass or hall of private audience while Rizvi states that it is the Treasury of gold and silver. \n\nIn front of this is a kiosk which four pillars and elaborately carved brackets. Popular tradition has ascribed it the function of the \u2018Astrologer\u2019s Seat\u2019, but according to Rizvi it is likely to be the place where Akbar or his principle treasurer sat and distributed coins to subordinate officers or to the poor. \n\nThe photograph shows damage to the eaves  of both buildings.",
