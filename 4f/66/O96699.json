They are used by Javanese men in the traditional forms of  headcloths (kain kepala) and skirtcloths (kain panjang). Today batik shirts are also very popular.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, both the Dutch and the Chinese in Java also wore clothes made from batik patterned cloth. Men relaxed at home in the early morning or evening wearing trousers such as these, which were secured around the waist by a string or belt. These trousers were usually made by cutting cloth from batik patterned waist cloths, but were sometimes made up and then decorated with batik designs. The design of this pair, with its large motifs of a bamboo like plant with lurking peacocks in blues, greens and browns, suggests that they were made at one of the towns on Java's north coast.",
