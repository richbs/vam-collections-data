The figures represent the dynastic alliances that made the Dacres one of the most influential families in the North West of England. They were made for Thomas, Lord Dacre, born in 1467, died 1525. In 1513 he led the English armies at the Battle of Flodden in Northumbria, near the Scottish border, a decisive victory against the Scots. The beasts may have stood guard at Lord Dacre\u2019s funeral in 1525 at Llanercost Priory: normally they were found in the Great Hall at the Dacre family home, first probably at Kirkoswald, and later Naworth, near Carlisle, Cumbria. They stood under a ceiling painted with portraits of the Kings of England, a physical demonstration of the Dacre family\u2019s loyalty to the crown. Naworth later became the home of the Howard family because Elizabeth Dacre, heiress of Naworth, married Lord William Howard, third son of the Duke of Norfolk, in 1577.  \n\nA fire in 1844, during the time of the 8th Earl of Carlisle, a descendant of the Howard family, destroyed the hall. Fortunately the beasts were rescued. After the fire, the Beasts were repainted in Victorian colours to imitate the original sixteenth century tinctures (the term used for heraldic colours). This was under the supervision of the Victorian architect Anthony Salvin, responsible for the restoration of Naworth \n\nThe gilding of the Dacre Bull\u2019s pizzle horrified a Christian visitor, accompanied by ladies, on a visit to Naworth shortly after: \u2018\u2026so obscene a representation exceeds anything in the worst idolatrous temple in heathen lands\u2026.Had the Decorator confined himself to gilding the Collar & Horns \u2026he would have shown a purer taste and been more in Conformity with the Engraving of the Arms.\u2019. In fact, the gilding of the Bull\u2019s pizzle, or private parts,[was heraldically appropriate: the Dacre Beasts represent the ancient lineage of the Dacre and Howard families; symbols of fertility were central to both families\u2019 authority.\n\nThe Dacre Griffin was actually the inspiration for the Gryphon in Lewis Carroll\u2019s children\u2019s novel \u2018Alice in Wonderland\u2019. The Gryphon is ordered by the Queen of Hearts to take Alice to meet the Mock Turtle. The book\u2019s illustrator, Tenniel, was invited to stay at Naworth by the aristic 9th Earl of Carlisle and would have seen the beast during his stay there. \n"

The banner bears the medieval arms of the Greystoke family, which are represented by 'three cushions d'argent' (three silver-coloured diamonds). The Dacre Beasts are rare survivors of a tradition of heraldic ornament. They represent one of the most powerful families in northern England and are a unique survivors of free standing, large-scale wooden heraldic sculpture from the English Renaissance.\n\nPeople\nElizabeth de Greystoke (1477-1516) was Thomas Lord Dacre's wife. The Dacres were one of the most powerful families in northern England during the Middle Ages.\n\nPlaces\nNaworth Castle, Brampton, Cumbria, was a family seat of the Dacre family from 1317 until 1577, when the Castle became the property of Lord William Howard through marriage to Elizabeth Dacre. Dacre Beasts have stood in the Hall at Naworth Castle since the early 16th century.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe Dacre Beasts were probably made by unnamed local craftsmen from a single, large oak grown on the estate.\n\nAdditional Information\nThe Dacre Beasts were repainted in 1849 after the fire at Naworth in 1844. The poles and coats of arms held by the beasts date from the mid-19th century.",

He was a formidable soldier who fought on the side of Henry Tudor against Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth and with the Earl of Surrey against the French and the Scots at the Battle of Flodden in 1513. Lord Dacre's prowess was epithomized by the battle cry \"a read bull, a read bull, a Dacre, a Dacre\". The crowned dolphin is the supporter of the Greystoke coat of arms. In 1488 Lord Dacre eloped with Elizabeth Greystoke (1471-1516), the heiress to the baronies of Greystoke and Fitzwilliam. Through his marriage Lord Dacre acquired Morpeth Castle and the manor of Henderskelfe, later rebuilt as Castle Howard. In 1577 Lord William Howard, son of the third Duke of Norfolk, married Elizabeth Dacre and the Dacre properties have descended in the Howard family. The barony of Gilsland was acquired through Ranulp de Dacre's marriage to Margaret de Multon in 1317. Ranulph de Dacre received a licence to crenellate Naworth in 1335. The beasts thus demonstrate the antiquity of the Dacres-one of the most powerfu Northern families-and the importance of two dynastic marriages.\nThey were probably made by local craftsmen from oak grown on the estate, although the names of the carvers and painters have not been recorded. Their design is derived from contemporary grants of arms to the Dacre, de Multon and Greystoke families. Dendrochronological analysis recently demonstrated that the single trunk of oak from which all four beasts were carved was felled between 1499 and 1549. Testing of the polychrome decoration has revealed at least three successive paintings on the Bull, the Ram and the Dolphin. Samples from the earliest decoration contain pigments available in the first quarter of the 16th century and are likely to form part of the original decoration.  The Dacre Beasts have remained in the hall at Naworth since early 16th century.\nThe present decoration dates from the 1840s and was executed after the fire at Naworth of 1844. The staves and coats of arms held by the beasts also date from the mid-19th century. The present appearance of the Dacre Beasts reflects mid-19th century antiquarian interest. They were rescued from a major fire at Naworth in 1844, and restored in 1849 under the careful supervision of the Victorian architect Anthony Salvin (1799-1844) who wanted the new work to marry as closely as possible with the old. Repainting of the Dacre Beasts was done by a Mr Wilkinson.\n\nHistorical significance: The Dacre heraldic beasts are unique national survivors of free standing large-scale wooden heraldic sculpture from the English Renaissance. Although there is both written and pictorial evidence for contemporary Royal Beasts, the Dacre Beasts are apparently the only recorded surviving heraldic beasts representing a noble family. They are also of considerable regional interest as they represent one of the most powerful families in Northern England. These heraldic sculptures demonstrate the primitive nature of British art in the early 16th century before the impact of the Italian Renaissance later in the reign of Henry VIII.",
