It was subsequently taken up, and twisted against them, by the Labour Party in the 1989 Election Campaign. Saatchi & Saatchi were employed not only for the 1977 and 1979 campaigns but for other aspects of the Conservative Party, including Mrs Thatcher's personal image, and they therefore laid themselves open to interpretation as the darlings of Thatcherite capitalism. Their enormous success enabled them to invest huge sums in the work of contemporary artists, and also to make a prodigious number of take-overs in the USA. However profits began to decline noticeably after the notorious 'Black Monday' on the Stock Exchange in 1989. The Collection has impressions of the 1977 and 1979 Conservative Party posters.
