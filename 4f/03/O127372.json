His work may be described as Symbolist and has much in common with that of figures such as Odilon Redon and Gustave Dor\u00e9, although Hieronymus Bosch, Giovanni Battista Piranesi and Francisco de Goya have also been cited as possible influences. \n\nBrandel\u2019s imagery often consists of fantastical architecture or  landscapes,  inhabited by men, women and animals engaged in strange or ritualistic behaviour, sometimes endowed with supernatural powers such as the ability to float or fly. Another interest was Greek mythology. Here a group of naked men and women are engaged in a wild dance dedicated to Bacchus, Greek god of wine.",
