The suite 'White Embossings on Gray' (WEG) are an extension of ideas formulated in 'Embossed Linear Constructions' made in 1969, where, through the total elimination of colour, the line partially de-materializes.\n\nIn WEG he used the same automatic engraving mill to cut the images into the printing plates, but instead of printing blind, the plates were also inked. As the achievement of a clean line under such conditions was difficult, a paper 'Roleaf' was specifically developed for Albers to use for this suite.",

The paper was a crucial element, since to preserve the precision of the machine embossing that had been attained in the 'Engraved Linear Constructions' while adding colour, required a fine surface texture that would accept the embossing and assure crisp lines, yet have sufficient absorbency  to produce a uniform unmodulated ink surface. Roleaf, the paper that was used, was developed at Gemini specifically for this purpose.\" [Brenda Danilowitz: The Prints of Josef Albers 1915-1976. Hudson Hills Press, New York. 2006. p.147]",
