The neck is banded with mother-of-pearl and tortoiseshell backed with metal foil. There are ten silver frets. The shaped flat head has eight rear pegs, for four double courses of wire strings (two steel, one brass, one overspun).'  \n\nAnthony Baines, <i>Catalogue of Musical Instruments in the Victoria and Albert Museum - Part II: Non-Keyboard Instruments</i> (London, 1978), p. 39.",
