Mahoney suggests that the two kneeling figures are studies for the kneeling Tobit in the picture of the Archangel leaving Tobit\u2019s house in the Mus\u00e9e Cond\u00e9, Chantilly. A bozzetto for the picture is illustrated in L. Salerno, <i>Salvator Rosa</i>, Florence, 1963, no. 72. The picture was one of a series of five painted in about 1662 for Carlo de Rossi, who subsequently placed them in a chapel in S. Maria in Montesanto, Rome. The history of the commission and of the five pictures is given in Salerno, pp.131-32.",
