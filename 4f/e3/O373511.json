This house was one of a terrace of four houses designed by the architect Baillie Scott (1865-1945) and built in 1908.  The first owner of the house was a C. Adams whose name is carved above the door of the garden shed from which this lock comes.  C.F.A. Voysey (1857-1941) designed many of the fittings for the houses in the terrace but only built the garage for No.8.  This was specially built for a subsequent owner of the house, the actor Robert Donat (1905-1958) so that he could reach his car without having to run the gauntlet of the crowds of fans waiting outside.  Robert Donat's first wife, Ella, was Voysey's niece.  The above information was supplied by the donor, Mr Bernard Lott.",

Voysey (1857-1941).\n\nThis lock comes from the garden shed belonging to the house.  This house was one of a terrace of four houses designed by the architect Baillie Scott and built in 1908.  The first owner of the house was a C. Adams whose name is carved above the door of the garden shed from which this lock comes.  C.F.A. Voysey designed many of the fittings for the houses in the terrace but only built the garage for No.8.  This was specially built for a subsequent owner of the house, the actor Robert Donat (1905-1958) so that he could reach his car without having to run the gauntlet of the crowds of fans waiting outside.  Robert Donat's first wife, Ella, was Voysey's niece.  The above information was supplied by the donor, Mr Bernard Lott.",
