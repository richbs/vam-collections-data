The obverse shows the bow of the sinking liner <font -u>Lusitania </font> which was torpedoed by a German submarine on the 7th of May 1915 and sunk with the loss of 1,198 lives. The reverse depicts Death selling tickets at a shipping office.\n[Box] Cardboard presentation box.  The lid of the presentation box is decorated with an illustration of a steaming liner and the text reads: \"R.M.S. LUSITANIA;/ CUNARD LINE. 30000 TONS:/ SUNK ON HER RETURN JOURNEY/ FROM THE UNITED STATES/ BY A GERMAN SUBMARINE/ MAY 7TH 1915\". The inside of the lid shows a propagandist text about the German medal and states that this piece \"is proof positive that such crimes are not merely regarded favourably but given every encouragement in the land of Kultur.\"\n[Leaflet] Leaflet entitled: \"A German Naval Victory\".  Illustrates both sides of Goetz's medal. The text emphasises that the German medal celebrates the sinking of the <font -u>Lusitania </font> as a naval victory and refers to the reverse of the medal with the concluding sentence: \"The picture seeks apparently to propound the theory that if a murderer warns his victim of his intention, the guilt of the crime will rest with the victim not the murderer.\"",

They were issued by the 'Lusitania Souvenir Medal Commitee' of 32 Duke Street, London.\nThe British blockade of Germany led to increased German U-boot attacks on civilian as well as armed vessels. On 7 may 1915 the Lusitania was hit by two German torpedoes and sunk with the loss of 1,198 lives.\nKarl Goetz then struck this satirical medal, depicting Death as skeleton, selling tickets.",
