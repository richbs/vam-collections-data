The silk has a metallic ground which seems to be silver strip open S-wound on white silk. The colours are pale pink, pale green and white and black. Pairs of white leaves, outlined in black, join to form ogival compartments above, below and to the side of the pink rosettes. The pattern consists of three or four variations with some rosettes in lozenges formed by the sub-pattern of pink and green floral motifs on fine white stems. All four sides are bound with black silk and silver strip close Z-wound on white thread. Across the upper edge, a band of interlaced metal thread, open S-wound on white Z-twist silk and also pink coated silver-strip, have been attached.\n\nThe reverse has an upper facing on black bias-cut silk and a loop of light green silk for the fastening. The backing is made of four pieces of printed cotton, one is a different pattern to the others. All have white plain woven  grounds with blue patterns and are probably roller-printed. The odd piece has a single flower repeated in offset rows, and the others have a vertical undulating leafy stem with a flower head set between stripes of fine lines and flower heads surrounded by leaves with a sub-pattern of wavy lines.",
