A solid walnut front with four parchmain 'panels', the design cut to accommodate the original iron lock; with a wrought iron handle at each end, fastened over a quatrefoil washer with split rings. \nThere is no moulding carved along the bottom edge of the 'panel' motif. Setting out marks visible on carved front. The lower (sapwood) edge of the chest with considerable worm damage that has not spread to the bottom.\nFitted at left end with an oak lidded till, the lid with iron hasp (lacking its exterior lock), and a shelf with moulded front edge running between the till front and the right end of the chest.\nThe lid on 3 original strap hinges fastened with nails; with a front plank (replaced?) of oak, and oak battens nailed up at each end. The walnut plank very worm-eaten but apparently original, while the absence of nails through hinge holes where the hinge extends over the front oak plank suggests that this is a replacement.\nThe bottom consisting of 2 planks of walnut (butt-jointed and doweled, showing shrinkage) nailed up all round and also pegged, with uneven wear (at most 1.5mm) showing where the chest stood originally on a plinth stand. 3 dowel holes (2 with broken dowels) in the leading edge of the bottom showing where the chest was doweled into its stand. The bottom now supported beneath with added short oak batten (earlier) and long softwood batten (later) nailed over the joint between the bottom planks\nThe back formed by a solid walnut plank, with infill patch on the backs surface.",
