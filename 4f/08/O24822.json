The Garuda, half man and half eagle, is a favourite subject in Nepalese art, and is traditionally represented engaged in mortal combat with its natural enemies, the water spirits or nagas.  The group with its flamboyant open scroll work shows the skill of the Newari metal workers of the Kathmandu Valley at their best.",
