Used by Paul Scofield (1922-2008) in Peter Brook's 1971 film of &lt;i&gt;King Lear&lt;/i&gt; by William Shakespeare (1564-1616).\n\nIn 2004 a poll of 200 members of the Royal Shakespeare Company voted Paul Scofield\u2019s King Lear as the greatest performance in a play by Shakespeare. Scofield played Lear for the RSC in 1962, directed by Peter Brook.  \u2018This production brings me closer to Lear than I have ever been; from now on, I not only know him but can place him in his harsh and unforgiving world\u2019, wrote Kenneth Tynan (Observer, 11 November 1962). Scofield\u2019s towering performance was re-created for the screen when Brook directed a film of the play, released in 1971. This was not intended as a film of the stage version, though it used several of the RSC production\u2019s leading players. It was shot on location in the snow-covered landscapes of North Jutland, Denmark, during the winter of 1968-1969. Filmed in black and white, play and setting matched each other in bleakness.",
