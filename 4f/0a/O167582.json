            "public_access_description": "This looking-glass frame combines two forms of decoration that were popular hobbies in late seventeenth-century England.  All the moulded elements are painted in imitation of Japanese black lacquer, using a technique called japanning.  Motifs such as the pair of figures with a parasol that features on the cresting were copied from pattern books, the most famous of which is A Treatise of Japanning and Varnishing published in 1688 by Stalker & Parker.  This volume also provided recipes for making varnishes for japanning.\n\nThe moulded elements form compartments, lined in silk twill, in which scrolling foliage, swans and vases of flowers are depicted in rolled paper.  This technique, often called quilling or paper filigree, was used to make pictures and to decorate all sorts of three-dimensional objects.  In this fine example the rolled paper is attached to the sides of the compartments rather than the base, allowing the silk lining to show underneath clearly. \n\nThe breadth of the frame and its elaborate decoration act as a foil for the small rectangle of mirror glass (this plate probably a replacement).  Mirror glass was still an expensive luxury in the seventeenth century and most looking glasses of this period have substantial frames to accentuate and draw attention to this extravagant item of furnishing.",
