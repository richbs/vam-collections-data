The fine earthenware now called 'Saint-Porchaire' was much admired in the 19th century as a prime example of the best of Renaissance ornament. Only a small number of pieces was produced (64 recorded) due to the technical skill involved.  They were considered as luxury objects from the 16th century. Only the aristocracy owned examples, which included cups, salts, candlesticks, bowls, ewers and tazze (e.g. tazza, c. 1540; London, V&A). In the 19th century the wares were copied by such factories as the Minton Ceramic Factory in England.",

Wares were made from a fine, white earthenware clay and were inlaid usually with brown and black slips in intricate patterns and coated in a clear lead glaze. The motifs were essentially derived from the pattern book La Fleur de la science de pourtraicture (Paris, 1530) by Francesco Pellegrino (d c. 1552). Later, coloured glazes and relief designs of animals or other subjects, attributable in part to Bernard Palissy, were added to the decorative repertory. Wares have generally been known as \u2018Henri Deux\u2019 wares. The technical skill involved explains the small number of pieces produced (64 recorded) and why from the 16th century they were considered as luxury objects. Only the aristocracy owned examples, which included cups, salts, candlesticks, bowls, ewers and tazze (e.g. tazza, c. 1540; London, V&A).
