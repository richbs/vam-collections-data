            "public_access_description": "This drawing is a design for a church by the British architect Sir William Chambers. It was commissioned in 1770 and was intended as the parish church of St Marylebone, just north of Oxford Street, London. The architect designed two schemes, one with a spire and one with a dome. This image shows the more expensive domed option. This kind of \u2018section\u2019 drawing, where the building appears to have been cut in half, is still used by architects today. Colour is used to indicate which walls have been \u2018cut through\u2019 and to describe the space behind. A range of drawings was produced for this project, from rough sketches to detailed plans. This is a highly finished \u2018presentation drawing\u2019 and would have been shown to the clients to convince them of the beauty of the scheme and the skill of the architect. However, in this instance it was not enough. The clients proved so indecisive that the church was built only in 1818, to a subsequent architect\u2019s design.",

Chambers was approached by Archdeacon Harley in 1770; the commission was to prove one of the most problematic of his career.  Chambers prepared a number of different schemes for the church, three of which were fully and expensively costed.  The Vestry vacillated, chose none of them, and finally tried to pay off Chambers with a derisory offer of \u00a3120.  Chambers protested in a letter (BM, Add.MA 41136,2-2v) which shows that he had already executed works on the vaults, burial ground and built the Court-house for the Vestry.  The church was eventually built in 1818 to the designs of Chamber's former pupil Thomas Hardwick incorporating many of his master's ideas...Chambers presented two schemes in 1770- one with a dome, the other, a spire, which he recommended... The section of a domed design, cat. 676, shows a less ambitious configuration, perhaps linking it to Chambers's attempts to reduce the price of the domed option.  The interior is circular, supporting a coffered dome.  This is a reworking by Chambers of his unbuilt design for a dome over the staircase hall for York House, modified through the influence of Gianlorenzo Bernini's S. Andrea al Quirinale in Rome.  The interior is dominated by a giant Corinthian order of attached columns around the walls, and free-standing ones carrying the dome and supporting the gallery.  The portico shelters a door leading to the gallery stairs.  Opposite the portico is a vestry, above which is the organ loft.  A complex crypt composed of massive brick piers, arranged in a two concentric circles, lies below the church.\nJohn Harris,'Sir William Chambers, Knight of the Polar Star', London, 1970, p.228, pl.145",
