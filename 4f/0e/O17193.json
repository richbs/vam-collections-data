This fabric might have been used for curtains or upholstery. In this period it was fashionable for the different furnishings used in a room, including window curtains and upholstery fabric, to match or complement each other.\n\nPeople\nRichard Ovey, for whom this fabric was printed, was a leading linen draper of the time whose customers included the Prince of Wales. Although he styled himself 'furniture printer', he did not actually print any fabrics. Instead, he commissioned designs from different printworks, which he then sold at his shop in Covent Garden, London.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThis fabric is blockprinted in a colour scheme known as 'drab style', which originated about 1799 and was particularly fashionable in the years up to 1807. It continued to be used for block-printed chintzes until about 1815. It had a restricted range of browns, yellows and greens which were made by adding blue to yellow, plus occasionally blue by itself. The availability of the dye quercitron for a fast yellow encouraged the style. The 15-year patent on that dye ran out in 1799, after which it became generally available.",
