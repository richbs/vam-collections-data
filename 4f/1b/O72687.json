            "public_access_description": "This cloche-type hat is made of smooth pink plaited straw. It has a deep round crown with a decorated band of brown chevron around it. The narrow brim is trimmed with brown cord at the edge. The front of the crown displays a panel formed by lines of petersham ribbon in orange and magenta. The panel encloses a decorative trim of bold stylised flowers in appliqu\u00e9d felt and velvet in pink, magenta, green, peach and orange. The cloche has a black lining. It was made in England about 1925 by Kilpin Ltd of London.\n\nCloches were probably the most iconic hats of the 1920s. They were made of straw, fabrics and especially felt. The high, bulbous crowns lent themselves to experimentation with pleating, beading, embroidery, appliqu\u00e9 and trimming. Although they were held to be brim-less, cloches had small frontal brims from 1922 to 1925, and longer, asymmetrical brims from 1926.",
