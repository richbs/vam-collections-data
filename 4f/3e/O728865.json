Each 3<sub>1/4</sub> x 4<sub>3/4\n</sub>E11/2-1940; E.13-1940\n\nThe increasing concern with Christmas felt in early Victorian times is seen in the advent of the first Christmas cards in the 1840s. H1, designed in  1843 by J.C. Horsley for his friend Henry Cole (see I 30, 31), was put on public sale in 1846.  The scenes chosen to decorate both this, the first Christmas card, and W.M.
