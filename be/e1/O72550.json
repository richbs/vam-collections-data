By 1572 he had begun to work for Queen Elizabeth I. \n\nThis self-portrait marks Hilliard's first encounter with the Renaissance ideal of the artist as an individual of genius. Dating from Hilliard's visit to France in 1576-1578, its mood is very much that of the portraiture of the art-loving French court, where artists enjoyed a far higher status than their English counterparts. Its boldness and brilliance demand recognition of Hilliard\u2019s genius, and express his aspirations to the status of a gentleman, not a tradesman. The reality on Hilliard's return to England was less ideal. A permanent position at court with all its attendant privileges eluded him, and he was compelled to set up as an artist in the City of London like any other craftsman.",

Full Citation:\n\n\u201cNICHOLAS HILLIARD\n\n<b>49 Self-portrait</b>, 1577\n<i>Victoria & Albert Museum (P.155-1910)</i>]\nVellum, stuck to card (the back of the original card is not visible, as a thick layer of later card has been glued to it), circular 41 mm, 1 5/8 in. diam.\n\nHilliard painted his self-portrait while he was in France.  As a miniature it has suffered extensive damage and restoration, bot the right cheeck and  beard and ruff have been repainted and the warm tones of the face are restorer\u2019s work.  In spite of this the brilliance and boldness of the characterisation comes through with force so that we can understand the high esteem in which this miniature and the companion one of his father (no. 48) were held from their first appearance at the beginning of the eighteenth century.\n\nCarl Winter, who fist discussed the stylistic sources, referred to the influence of portrait medals by Germain Pilon which often show the bonnet touching the rim of the circumference, a view endorsed by Auerbach.  This, however, was already a feature of miniature painted before the French visit.  It is the mood rather than the formula which echoes portraiture of the late Valois court.  Painters there enjoyed a higher social standing than their English counterparts who were regarded as artificers and tradespeople.  That he chose to paint himself at this moment reflects a period when he moved in French humanist circles and exchanged conversation with the poet Ronsard.  The status enjoyed by painters at the Valois court must have come as a revelation to Hilliard and it must have been there surely that he first came into contact with the Renaissance concept of the artist.  Exposure to the highly sophisticated attitudes of the art-loving court of Henri III and Catherine de Medici prompted Hilliard to recognize his own genius.\n\nThe miniature of his father (no. 48) is also probably dated 1577 and shares the same descent from Nicholas\u2019s son, Laurence, and bother were once inset into later frames on the lines of that still surrounding Allice Hilliard (no. 77).  Possibly it was Laurence Hilliard who mounted the family portraits in this way.  De Piles records the inscriptions on both.  That on Hilliard ran: <i>Nicholas Hilliardus Aurifaber, Sculptor, & celebris Illuminator Serenissimae Reginae Elisbethae, Anno 1577.  Aetatis suae 30</i> (<i>Art of Painting</i>, London, 1706, p. 431).  Sometime before 1735 the frame and mount were discarded when they were set, as Vertue records (see Collections) in a snuff box lid by the 7th Earl of Leicester.  Two versions exist (Buccleuch and a private collection of a self-portrait as a boy, dated 1560.  One is certainly a later copy and the second of uncertain status, (Strong, <i>Renaissance Miniature</i>, p. 66).\n\nINSCRIBED: On either side of the head: <i>Ano Dmi. / 1577 ; AEtatis Suae / 30;</i> above the left shoulder: <i>NH</i> in monogram (damaged).\nOn the back of the frame an inscription on part of their descent by the Hon. Mrs Thomas Liddell: <i>Hilliard the / son painted by himself \u2013 see the Father / These pictures were given to me by Mrs Clavering / who had them originally from Sir Robt Rich / 1843 C E Liddell.</i>\n\nCOLLECTIONS: This or both this and the one of Richard Hilliard (no. 48) are referred to in the will of Laurence Hilliard dated February 21st 1640 bequeathing to his son, Thomas, \u201cby way of Leagacey my gran Father(s) (pic) Hillyard his picture in an ivrey box with a Cristall vpponst\u201d (Auerbach , <i>Hilliard</i>, p. 227) this originally read \u201cmy Fathars pic\u201d and was altered to \u201cmy gran Fathar\u201d; both are next referred to by de Piles in 1706 when in the possession of Simon Fanshaw: \u201cThere are moreover, two wonderful pieces of his, now in the Possession of <i>Simon Fanshaw</i>, Esq; and by him valu\u2019d, nor without reason, as \u2018tis the opinion of some good Judges, at above 50 Guineas each, tho\u2019 not much bigger than a Crown-Piece.  One of these is the Picture of our Artist himself, with this / inscription in Gold Letters round it. / <i>Nicolaus</i>\u2026 / The other is the Picture of his Father\u2026These two pictures in </i>Miniature</i> are so Masterly done, that not only the Faces are finely colour\u2019d an naturally with a good <i>Rilievo</i>; but that almost each single Hair is express\u2019d.\u201d (De Piles, <i>The Art of Painting</i>, London 1706, pp. 430-31 and Vertue. <i>Notebooks</i>, II, p. 129); both were acquired by John Sidney, 6th Earl of Leicester (1680-1737) and passed on his death to his brother Jocelyn Sidney, 7th and last Earl of Leicester (d. 1743); these facts are recorded by Vertue when he saw them at Leicester House in 1735 and in addition he records: \u201cthe writeing round these two pictures and the gilt mettal Frames first made for them was taken away and the two pictures sett in a gold Snuff box \u2013 by the present Earl of Leicester who had them from his Brother. but I wish them to be returned into their old Frames again\u201d (Vertue, <i>Notebooks</i>, IV, p. 80); Walpole records that the Earl of Leicester gave the snuff box to Field-Marshal Sir Robert Rich, Bt, (<i>Anecdotes of Painting in England</i>, London, 1782, ed, I, p. 257 note); descended from Sir Robert Rich, 4th Bt, (1685-1768) to his son, Lt- General Sir Robt Rich, 5th Bt, (1714-85); they passed from him to a Mrs Clavering who gave them to her niece, Caroline Elizabeth (d. 1890), eldest daughter of George, 5th Viscount Barrington, in 1843 on her marriage to the Hon Thomas Liddell; she, in turn, gave them to her niece, Mary Frances (d. 1913), daughter of William, 6th Viscount Barrington, and wife of Alfred Sartoris; she sold them at Christie\u2019s 27th June 1906 (lot 76); bt, Hodgkins; acquired by George Salting and bequeathed by him with his collection to the V&A, 1910.\n\nLITERATURE: Winter, <i>EliabethanMiniatures</i>, pl. 111 (a).
