Constable R.A. No. 71 [608-1888] is comparable in style and subject-matter with Nos. 66-70.\n\nNote on Nos. 66-71\n\nThese drawings are carried out in a manner which Constable preserved for a number of years when making watercolours of East Bergholt Church, the consistency of which makes the precise dating of uninscribed examples, such as Nos. 68-70, impracticable. An early instance is found in the watercolour 'East Bergholt Church' in the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa, which is signed and dated 1805, and is virtually identical with No. 70 [200-1888] apart from being two inches more in height. A later example is the drawing of 1811 recorded in the note on No. 70.'\n\nReynolds, pp. 57-58",
