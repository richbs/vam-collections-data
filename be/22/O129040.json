            "public_access_description": "Brass and pewter candlesticks often survive in pairs as they were sometimes used on altars in churches. The needs of church ritual inspired the production of a range of richly decorated vessels and vestments, crosses and images. For many manufacturers, the church provided the principal market until the 15th century. Wealthy churches could afford objects made of gold or silver, adorned with enamels or gems, precious materials seen as symbolic of the reverence due to the worship of God. Less wealthy churches used cheaper vessels in copper, brass or pewter.\n\nThese candlesticks have 'prickets' (spikes) to hold the candles. Pricket candlesticks developed from simple iron spikes on feet. Candlesticks like these, with conical circular bases, evolved in the mid-14th century from round based candlesticks set on 3 lion feet which in themselves evolved from tripod candlesticks.\n\nWax candles were expensive but firmer than tallow (animal fat) and were suitable for prickets.Tallow was soft and generally required a socketed candlestick.

The needs of church ritual inspired the production of a range of richly decorated vessels and vestments, crosses and images. For many manufacturers, the church provided the principal market until the 15th century. Wealthy churches could afford objects made of gold or silver, adorned with enamels or gems, precious materials seen as symbolic of the reverence due to the worship of God. Less wealthy churches used cheaper vessels in copper, brass or pewter.\n\nThese candlesticks have 'prickets' (spikes) to hold the candles.
