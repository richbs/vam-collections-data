The lower register shows a scene with a central tree with a solar disk behind it. From within the branches of the tree the top half of a  figure (Tree Goddess)with raised hands in the anjali positioninclines herself towards the seated figure (the Buddha)on the left of the scene.  He is seated cross-legged with one hand holding his robe in his lap with the other raised across his chest holding his hand with the  palm turned inwards. Three turbanned figures stand on the right hand side inclining their heads towards the seated figure in anjalimudra. Two further figures stand behind the seated figure, the outer one turbanned and the inner one without any headgear,( possibly depicting Indra and Brahma).\nThe carving is flanked by rounded mouldings on either side decorated with a sharply carved leaf pattern pointing upwards. The two registers are divided by a bracketted fillet and the shallow base has a bead and cylinder moulding.The subject represents the request of the kings of the Four Quarters and the Spirit of the Rajayatana Tree to the Buddha to resume his seat beneath the Bodhi tree.  Above is a beam-supported platform upon which are seated three Buddhas in the Dhyana position within an arcade of which only the bases of the columns remain.",
