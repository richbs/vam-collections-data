With an unearthly shriek followed by a ghastly distortion of the showman\u2019s flute music, there appears on the top of the booth the head and shoulders of the wraith of Petrouchka. The moon at this moment breaking through the clouds illumines the face a ghastly yellow. As the showman looks upwards the head and arms jerk frantically in a gesture of menace.\u2019\nThis appears as the last illustration in Impressions of the Russian Ballet Petrouchka 1919\n\nPetrouchka was choreographed by Mikhail Fokine and designed by Alexandre Benois to an original score by Igor Stravinsky for Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in 1911. It returned to the repertoire of the Ballets Russes in London after the War on the opening night of the season at the Alhambra Theatre 30 April 1919 when L\u00e9onide Massine played the title role. Beaumont appears to have planned this volume in the series during that season and as he notes he \u2018entrusted the illustrations to a Russian artist'.\n\nBeaumont commented that \u2018Few of those who have read those little books would realize the work that went into them. Once the episode for illustration had been chosen, my collaborator and I had to watch the ballet night after night until the particular group or pose appeared, and during that brief moment check up on all details of the poses. In the interval, we would go behind and sketch the scenery while it was being set, and note the details of the costumes from the dancers, as they strolled on the stage before the ballet.\u2019 Beaumont The Diaghilev Ballet in London A Personal Record London, Putnam 1940 p.141",
