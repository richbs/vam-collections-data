This chair would have been used with a separate seat cushion on the solid seat board. The carved back-pieces, board seat and single, turned front stretcher are distinctive features found on many chairs linked to south Yorkshire. Several workshops must have produced large quantities, to judge by the numbers of such chairs that have survived. \n\nThe carved back-pieces often display a stylised bearded head of tear-drop form, that has been thought to represent Charles I, and to indicate royalist sympathies around the time of the Restoration of the monarchy. For this reason this type of chair has been traditionally dated to about 1660. However, no such chairs can be firmly dated so early, and their arched back-pieces may have been influenced by high-backed caned-chairs of the early eighteenth-century.\n\nOn loan to the Elizbethan House, Plymouth.",

Chinnery suggests p.480 that the double cross-splat backstool originated in Yorkshire, but examples are now widely spread, and that it may now be too late to locate the original workshop centres, of which there must have been several. He suggests that early specimens may date from a little before 1650, while later examples were produced up to 1700 and a little later.\n\nWells-Cole (1971) suggests that large numbers \u2018exist throughout the West and North Ridings. They probably all belong  to the second half of the 17th century although only one dated example (1686) has been traced. The decoration of the back rails indicates that channelled spiral motifs combined with deep cross hatching, stamped enrichment and foliate carving was widely popular in the county. Since this stylised pattern is not repeated on other kinds of furniture its value as a feature for identifying companion pieces of local origin is limited although it obviously expresses a vigorous tradition.\u2019 (p.10)",
