The top has been seamed across the width and there are two vertical seams.  These pieces are from similar embroideries.\nDirectional design with the top of the pattern  at the bottom of the panel, so that the wearer saw the correct pattern.\nThe main pattern is a series of diagonal lines from lower right to upper left.  These are chevron lines in green and yellow with pink and blue edging.\nThere are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: green ground with iris-like flower in mauve outlined in black and an almost round yellow flower with a pink cross in the centre.\n[2] wider stripes: it is not possible to describe the design because of the disruption caused by the seamed pieces.\nThere is no narrow border down the lower part of the sides because the sides have been cut.\nThe bottom border has pink blossoms pointing to the lower right alternating with a multi-headed yellow and mauve flower.\nThreads: 2S silk: red, white, black, light blue, blue, yellow, pink, green, mauve, light green, light turquoise.",
