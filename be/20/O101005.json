He is recognised for his unconventional structures which symbolise the meaning and purpose of the building Although now an American citizen he was born in  Poland in 1946. Vespa, manufactured by the Italian engineering company Piaggio, arrived in the world in the same year, the product of a brilliant design by Piaggio's leading designer, Corradino D'Ascanio. D'Ascanio, designer of the first modern helicopter, wanted to replace the unweildy motor bike with a simple, clean, robust vehicle which could be driven easily by anyone, including women. Since the first 15 came onto the market in 1946 Vespas have become one of the most efficient and popular modes of transport that, constantly re-invented, have managed to stay ahead of fashion as well as of social and economic needs. In customising this classic of modern design Libeskind seems to be making a statement not only about about his own ideals of efficiency, adaptability and visual appeal but also about phoenix-like emergence from the ashes of the Second World War.",
