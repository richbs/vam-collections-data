They were intended as coverlets, hangings, or prayer mats. The different sections of the pattern are defined by a series of rectangles. The main field pattern contained within the longest and central rectangle, is dominated by a central cusped medallion with a quarter of the medallion repeated in each corner. Above and below the central medallion, on the edge of two opposite ends of the central rectangle is a small 'rockery' consisting of three cones. From each rockery stems a pair of delicate flowering and foliated branches, with very slender leaves, but exaggeratedly large flowerheads. This tracery is arranged so as to cover the whole of the ground in the rectangle, leaving no large spaces of white between the pattern. On each rockery is a pair of confronted parrots. The remainder of the cloth is accompanied by a series of borders, narrow and broad, some containing a scrolling stem design, with stylised flowerheads in the loops, and others with a run of <i>mihrabs</i> framing a run of cusped cones, connected by a running looped stem at their bases. The principle and longest border at either end of the cloth, consists of a larger version of the <i>mihrab</i> or arcade design, framing a row of stylised cone-shaped flowering trees growing from vases. These trees alternate with a series of cones. Sewn onto the outside of the cloth is a printed cotton with a repeating pattern of Kashmir shawl style cones or butis.\nColour: Palampore has white ground and multi-coloured design. Printed cotton around the edges has a blue ground, with cones in white, pink, blue, green and yellow.",
