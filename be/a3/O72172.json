One of his first works was A Line Made by Walking (England 1967), a visible track in the grass made by walking back and forth across a field. Since then Long has walked in many countries and represented the experience in the form of photographs, annotated maps and lists of sights, sounds and sensations. This print, in which the shape of the African continent is marked out by the artist's muddy footprints, was produced and published for a charity appeal to raise funds to alleviate famine in Africa.",
