            "public_access_description": "The art of engraving gemstones can be traced back to ancient Greece in the 8th century BC and earlier.  Techniques passed down to the Egyptians and then to the Romans.  There were major revivals of interest in engraved gems in Europe during the Byantine era, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and again in the 18th and 19th centuries.  At each stage cameos and intaglios, these skillful carvings on a minute scale, were much prized and collected, sometimes as symbols of power mounted in jewelled settings, sometimes as small objects for private devotion or enjoyment.  These three intaglios date from around the years 360-400 CE.  The most distinct of them, the large central one, depicts the goddess Fortuna with her usual attribute, a cornucopia, sign of plenty.  Here she is seated on the joined 'protomes' of two goats.  This type of depiction of the front portion of an animal or human body originally derived from the art of the Persian empire.  The three gems, which probably had no common origins, were mounted together into a gold ring at some point during the late eighteenth century.",

Although the gemstone collection is not as comprehensive as that found at the Natural History Museum in London, it is of particular historic interest as its formation pre-dates the development of many synthetic stones and artificial enhancements. All the stones were mounted as rings before they came to the Museum.  Some are held in the Sculpture Section, other more elaborately mounted ones in the Metalwork Section.\n\nAs well as being a clergyman, collector and dillettante, the Reverend Townshend wrote poetry.  He met Robert Southey in 1815 and through him the Wordsworths, the Coleridges and John Clare.  He was a friend of Charles Dickens and dedicatee of his novel 'Great Expectations'.\n\nHistorical significance: The device of Fortuna seated or standing on two animals is discussed by Martin Henig in his <u>Classical Gems:  Ancient and Modern Intaglios and Cameos in the Firzwilliam Museum, Cambridge</u>, Cambridge University Press, 1994, no. 90, pp. 53/4.",
