Green areas and lakes have/ been added as shapes which/ can be filled with/ colour and used to mask other detail.\n STAGE:3/ The road text is added using the centre lines to/ position the names. Various user commands are/ used to position text around curved roads. Once/ the text has been placed the centre line is./ moved to another level. Buildings, symbols and/ other text are also added. The boxes placed around names are shapes, which can be filled/ and are used to mask the background detail\n STAGE:4/ The border, grid and reference are drawn in separate design files and a preliminary feature/ table is written to produce a plot. A linestyle/ library is used to change for example, a/ footpath into a dashed or dotted line.\n STAGE:5/ Before creating a final plot the vector lines have/ to be converted into raster lines with the use of/ feature tables and linestyle libraries.
