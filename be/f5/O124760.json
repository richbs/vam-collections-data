            "public_access_description": "Printed designs for the sides of gold boxes in the rococo style.  These copperplate engravings are printed from two images engraved on one plate. They were produced for the private use of goldsmiths and could be used as an aid to producing further designs by modification in pencil, or could be used as a base to try out enamel or gold colours.  They could also be shown to potential customers. \n\nThese prints were made by an anonymous designer in about 1754-1755, however,  almost identical decoration can be found on the side of a rectangular snuffbox in the Louvre, made by the goldsmith Jean Ducrollay, (1710-1787).  Unlike the other plates printed by anonymous designers in the album, this example has been carried out by a professional copperplate engraver. \n\nThe prints are from an album of designs which date from about 1735-1820 and includes those for snuffboxes, scent holders, watches and watch cases, spoons, fans and fan mounts, small swords, and chatelaines (ornamental chains, pins, or clasps usually worn at a woman's waist, to which trinkets, keys, purses, or other articles are attached).  \n\nThere is a close relationship between the contents of the album and known work by three Parisian goldsmiths, Ducrollay, Pierre- Fran\u00e7ois Drais (active 1761-1788), and Charles Ouizille (1744-1830) whose names appear on the first page of the album. This suggests that all the designs emanate from their workshops.  Drais worked for the Court at Versailles as jeweller to both King Louis XV and Louis XVI. Ouizille worked in this capacity for Louis XVI. Most of the material dates from the period 1755-90.",
