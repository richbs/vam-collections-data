            "physical_description": "Table cloth of linen damask. In the centre is a large eight-lobed medallion and the lobes are cusped. This contains a design of stiff bulrushes springing from the sides and corners of a central square pond containing fish and flower heads. Across the bulrushes on the straight sides flies a bird. Almost obliterating the rushes from the corners are large roundels containing two smaller flying birds between a sprays of blossom and another group of bulrushes, repeating the curve of the roundel. The rest of the field is scattered with small roundels formed of a bulrush and another plant curving round a small bird.\n\nThe border, 28 inches wide, is really two borders with a gap between them. The inner border contains a roundel with birds flying over fish in water, with three clumps of bulrushes, alternating with larger bulrush clumps projecting into the field and a bird perched among the stems. The outer border alternates a fish and a bird flying head on, silhouetted against further clumps of bulrushes. Each border has elaborate edgings with bead, dog-tooth, arcading, trefoil meander, elaborate cresting or formal flower heads in rows. \n\nSatin of 5.",
