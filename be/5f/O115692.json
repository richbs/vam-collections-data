            "history_note": "When it was bought by the Museum, it was suggested that the head was similar to a fragment of sculpure representing the Last Supper, from the church of Saint Martin in Saint-Gilles-du-Gard, which was discovered in the wall of a house near the church in 1949.\n\nHowever, P. Williamson has subsequently discovered a photograph of the V&A head on display in the crypt of the abbey church in Saint-Gilles-du-Gard in 1910. This fact, and the similarities between the V&A carving and a fragmentary tympanum showing the Last Judgement still at Saint-Gilles, suggest that the V&A head came from the main abbey church rather than the nearby Saint Martin.\n\nIt is not known how the head passed out of the ownership of the abbey church, onto the art market. It was in the Kelekian collection until 1941, when it went to a collection in the USA. Purchased by the Museum at Christie's, London, 8 December 1987 9lot 97) for \u00a312,265.\n\nHistorical significance: The sculptures at Saint-Gilles-du-Gard represent the epitome of the Romanesque style in Provence, incorporating strong influences from the surrounding areas, but clearly affected by the considerable remains of classical sculpture to be found in the region. This head has an obvious classicising manner, and demonstrates the debt owed by Romanesque sculptors to antique sculpture.",
