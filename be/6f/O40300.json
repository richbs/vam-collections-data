King Sivi (Thiwi), out riding his elephant, encounters the stunningly beautiful Ohmadani, and becomes besotted by her. But she is the wife of Ahbipayaka, his good frind and faithful general.\nThe bottom section shows a courtly couple attended by two ministers and an official; the story has yet to be identified. (Inf. from Noel Singer 2002)\nAll the figures are dressed in the court costumes of the Konbaung Dynasty.\nThe seven borders which surround the central panel have been painstakingly decorated in a series of meandering floral and foliate patterns, together with bands of complicated luntaya motifs found in the traditional pahso and hta-mein or lower garments worn by men and women.",

The owner would have used it either as a decorative wall hanging, a room partition, or as a screen hung outside the house on festive occasions. The kalaga depicts episodes from the popular Candakinnari and Ummadanti Jatakas (stories of the Buddha's former lives). The appliqu\u00e9 design on a brown/green woolen cloth ground is worked in coloured fabrics, ornamented with sequins, and with face features partly painted. The costumes of the figures are depicted in the stylised tradition of Burmese theatre relate to the fashions worn in the Mandalay Court of about 1880.\n\nBritain's control of Burma extended as the 19th century progressed, and the country was  annexed in 1885. The extravagant style of kalagas appealed to Burmese and Europeans alike and their popularity soared in the middle of the 19th century.\n\nThis kalaga was acquired by the Museum from the Colonial and Indian Exhibition held in London in 1886, soon after the fall of Mandalay.",

Great ingenuity has been employed in making sure that the decoration in the surrounding borders have not been duplicated. As the figures are extremely elegant and lively, the artist who worked out the design for these two kalagas was obviously talented and well-trained. He may have been an ex-court artist who had moved to Rangoon where work was more lucrative.",
