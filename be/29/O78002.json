Commonly known as 'Chinese blue and white', vases like this were used to decorate the interiors of many British homes in the 19th century. Being hand-painted, minor differences between this vase and its companions (museum nos. C.889&A-1910 and C.890&A-1910) are discernible.\n\nPlace\nThe Grove, Harborne, near Birmingham, was commissioned by William Kenrick (1831-1919). An inventory drawn up in 1911 shows that the anteroom was decorated with a large collection of ceramics, including Wedgwood, Spode, Worcester, art pottery and Chinese blue and white. Although this vase does not come from The Grove, it is of a type that would have been included in Kenrick's collection.\n\nTime\nChinese blue and white had been imported into Britain since the 16th century. Although by the 1870s these wares were no longer rarity items, they continued to feature prominently in interior design. Rooms were filled with blue and white porcelain of different shapes and sizes to create a sumptuous effect, with older pieces being displayed alongside newer products.",
