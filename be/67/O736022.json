Le Mans Cathedral. The original portions of an \"Ascension,\" c.1093-1120.\n<i>Signed</i> John Trinick del. MCMXXXIV.<i>\nWater-colour. About a quarter to a third actual size.\n</i>E.594-1936\n<i>Note by the Artist:-</i> \"See an article [and colour reproduction of this drawing] in <i>Apollo</i>, vol. XXIII, no. 134, Feb. 1936, pp.65-66, for a summary of evidence concerning this panel and a discussion of the possibilities of the designs having originated in a painted MS.\n\n\"Here it may be emphasised that this panel does not show glass-design as such. Almost identical figures can be found in Romanesque sculpture (<i>vide</i> above article); which seems to suggest a common prototype both for sculpture and glass. It has analogies with the great XII century 'Crucifixion Window' of the Cathedral of Poitiers, which contains figures of a similar type - but with no other that I am acquainted with among French stained glass. (The XII century fragment in the Cathedral of Bourges is another example which suggests origins in a MS - though the prototype is there Byzantine of a specialised kind and not Romanesque.)\n\n\"The 'rhythm' of these figures is not that of early glass-design - there is a vitality in them which suggests the sweep of pen or brush; an existing design appears simply to have been 'carried out' in glass. This is further suggested by the counter-changed background - such 'panelling' is foreign to glass-design and there is no other example of it known to me, except Poitiers.\n\n\"The ascending figure of Christ, with two censing angels, which appears above the panel in its present position in the Cathedral - together with the border round the whole - are modern.\n\n\"It is probable that it may be dated 1093, or slightly earlier. (<i>vide</i> article).'\n<u>Apollo</u>, vol. XXIII, no. 134, Feb. 1936, pp.65-66\nArticle on this window which is illustrated with a colour reproduction of the drawing E.594-1936",
