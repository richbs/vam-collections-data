Studied with BR Haydon, entered the RA Schools 1817 (at the age of 14); won annual prizes of the Royal Society of Arts 1813-17. A precocious and prodigious talent, as both painter and draughtsman, he exhibited - in a long and distinguished career - 179 works at the RA between 1815 and 1873, 94 at the BI 1818-65, and four at the SBA 1826-32. \nSubjects included portraits, but predominantly dealt with animal and human genre, often based in Scotland. Elected ARA 1826 (at the earliest permitted age), RA 1831. Received the patronage of the Russell family, and - most importantly- that of the Royal family, to whom he was Drawing Master, beginning in 1836 with the Duchess of Kent (Queen Victoria's mother); most significantly, he represented in visual form the Queen and Prince Albert's love for the life and landscape of the Scottish Highlands. Together with George IV's celebrated visit to Edinburgh 1822, and the great popularity of Sir Waiter Scott's Waverley novels, Landseer's contribution to the place of Scotland in European culture in the 19th century was considerable. The artist's own popularity was increased by the great number of reproductive prints after his works (Graves alone lists 434 by 126 engravers, see Lit below); his 'Monarch of the Glen' (exh, RA 1851), commissioned by the House of Lords but the cost refused by the House of Commons, was eventually bought by Sir Thomas Dewar and reproduced on his family firm's whisky bottle labels. Also significant was his anthropomorphic treatment of animals, particularly dogs; the Art Journal obituarist stressed that 'his dogs are not mere portraits only, they are thinking, almost rational, creatures, wanting only the gift of speech to hold converse with us'. Knighted 1850; offered PRA 1865, but refused, almost certainly because of his poor physical and mental health. Died London 1 October 1873; buried in St Paul's Cathedral. His studio sale was at Christie's 8-15 May 1874; a commemorative exhibition was held at the RA 1874/5. After the Royal Collection, the V&A possesses the largest holding of Landseer's works; there are a great many drawings and prints as well as the oils catalogued below, principally from the Sheepshanks Gift, one of the artist's most important patrons. \nLIT: \tF G Stephens The Early Works of Sir Edwin Landseer RA 1869; J Dafforne Pictures by Sir Edwin Landseer ... 1873; Art Journal 1873, p326 (obit); interleaved copy of 1874 RA exhibition catalogue, annotated by C S Mann, with photographs of prints after Landseer, 1874-7,4 vols (National Art Library, V&A); A Graves Catalogue of the Works of the Late Sir Edwin Landseer 1876; C Monkhouse entry in DNB; C Lennie Landseer: Victorian Paragon 1976; R Ormond Sir Edwin Landseer Philadelphia Museum of Art and Tate Gallery exhibition catalogue 1981 (With full bibliography). \n\nThe Drover's Departure - A Scene in the Grampians \nFA88 Neg31851 \nCanvas, 125.8 X 191.2 cm (49 \u00bd\u00d7 75 \u00bc ins) Sheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nCommissioned by the 6th Duke of Bedford, and exhibited at the RA in 1835. The Athenaeum fully described the subject: \n\nThe scene is the Grampians; a long winding line of cattle, on their way to the south, are descending by a picturesque road; an old highlander has come to the door of his cottage, and sits helpless and gazing, like one doomed never to lead a drove again; friend is bidding farewell to friend - parting cups are filling and emptying - parting words of love or of business are uttering - dogs are gambolling - the very cattle seem conscious of what is passing, and are gathered here and there into groups equally natural and picturesque. Words cannot convey a sense of glory of colours, nor do justice to the expression of the pencil; any account of this excellent picture we feel must be very imperfect; we shall, therefore, say no more in detail. . . \nThe critic concludes, however: 'The animal nature is, we fear, too strong for the human nature; the clucking hen is equal to the highland wife; and there is a black bull which some come to prefer to the man who drives him'. \nThis latter view was shared by at least one French critic when the work was shown at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1855; 'It is a curious picture of national manners - interesting as a page of Sir Walter Scott. There are a thousand delicacies of detail in this charming picture ... Here, as is his wont, Landseer has given the place of honour to animals - man is but an accessory on his canvas'. \nW P Frith (My Autobiography and Reminiscences) 1887, I, pp204-5} related the acquisition of the work by John Sheepshanks: \nWhen in the humour Mr Sheepshanks would name the prices that his pictures had cost him. I am afraid to trust to my memory for many instances; but I can well recollect the astonishment with which I heard of the incredibly small sums for which he had acquired some of the most wonderful of Landseer's works. One of the largest - 'The Departure of the Highland Drovers' - was a commission from the Duke of Bedford for \u00a3500. When the picture was finished, the Duke said he was very poor, and if Landseer could find another purchaser he (the noble patron) would be glad to resign 'so beautiful a work'. Another neglect of a good investment; for undoubtedly, if 'The Departure of the Highland Drovers' were sold now, it would bring quite as many thousands as the hundreds for which the Duke might have purchased it. Mr. Sheepshanks always chuckled when he told how, having heard of the Duke's wish, he took immediate steps to gratify him. \nThe work was one of the artist's major successes at the RA; Whitley records the crowds pressing in front of it, and the etching by Watt was extremely popular. As Ormond comments of the subject: 'It draws on traditions that were already passing away rapidly. The great drives of Highland cattle and sheep south to the English markets were part of the reassuring myth of Highland adventurousness and self-sufficiency perpetuated by Sir Walter Scott and other romantic writers, but, in fact, economic conditions were far bleaker'. For fuller details see A R B Haldane The Drove Roads of Scotland (1952); Ormond also refers to a pamphlet of about 1841- The Highland Drovers - published in connection with the Watt print. \nThe work may be related in certain aspects of the composition with the later and more dramatic 'Flood in the Highlands' (RA 1860, now Aberdeen Art Gallery); F G Step hens (Sir Edwin Landseer 1881) states that 'Tethered Rams' is a study for the present work, which seems unlikely (see p146). The horse on the left appears in 'A Highland Scene' of about 1834 (now Wallace Collection; see J Ingamells Catalogue of Pictures I, 1985, p113, repr). \nAccording to the pamphlet of about 1841, the location of the setting is the Ochil Hills, south-west of Perth; Ormond thinks this unlikely. According to Stephens, John Landseer, the artist's father, was the model for the old shepherd, and Robert Leslie, C R Leslie's son, for the boy. \nPROV: See above \nEXH: \tRA 1835 (167); Exposition Universelle Paris 1855 (861); Tate 1982 (41) \nENGR: \tJ H Watt 1841 (repr Stephens 1869); Herbert Davis 1859; William Roffe 1892, as pl 56 of Works of Sir Edwin Landseer RA  (second series) \nAthenaeum 16 May 1835, p379; The Times 23 May 1835, p5; Art Union 1839, pp6, 149; The Highland Drovers pamphlet, nd [about 1841]; Art Union 1841, pp127, 141; G Waagen Treasures of Art in Great Britain 1854, II, p300; Art Journal 1855, p281; T Gautier Les Beaux-Arts en Europe Paris 1855, p75; Stephens, p57, repr p1 12; Landseer Gallery 1871, p121; Dafforne, pp 13--4; F G Stephens Memoirs 1874, pp96-7, repr pl 11; Mann I, p105; Graves p18, no 207; Landseer Gallery 1878, pl 14; F G Stephens Sir Edwin Landseer 1881; P G Hamerton Graphic Arts 1882, pp242-3; T H Ward English Art in the Public Galleries of London nd [1888], II, p163; J Manson Sir Edwin Landseer 1902, pp 79, 81-2; A Dayot La Peinture Anglaise Paris 1908, p175; E Chancellor Walks Among London's Pictures 1910, p251; W T Whitley Art in England 1821-1837, 1930, p299; Lennie, pp54-5, 82; Ormond pp84-5 {with further references} \n\n\nRonald Parkinson\"\nRichard Ormond, <u>Monarch of the Glen: Landseer in the Highlands</u>.

For centuries sheep and cattle have been herded south from the Highlands to the markets of Lowland Scotland and northern England. This was one of the staple products of the Highland economy and large numbers of animals were involved. The droves themselves were formidable undertakings, for keeping sheep and cattle fed and healthy over long distances and rough terrain required high levels of skill and experience. The droves were well organised along established routes that stretched far and wide across Scotland. The drovers were an independent body of men who specialised in the trade, and they were generally employed by agents acting for the farmers and landowners. \n\nLandseer's painting is a microcosm of Highland life. It was criticised at the time for being over-burdened with incident and detail. The main action takes place outside a turf-covered bothie with groups of animals and people left and right. A departing drover, babe in arms, stands at the apex of a pyramid of figures that includes an old woman, and two young women fussing over an elderly man, presumably their father, who is smoking his pipe. In the foreground several incidents are taking place: a puppy is taunting a hen which is fiercely defending its young; and an excited terrier, watched by a crouching boy, looks out from under a bench at a dignified sheep dog suckling a puppy as if about to spring. In the middle distance a pair of seated lovers bid each other a fond farewell. A grey Highland pony with a pack saddle holds the stage centre left with sheep and rams beside it, a Highland bull and cow beyond, and then some goats, a veritable Noah's Ark of domestic animals. In the distance there are more leave-takings, while in the valley massed herds of cattle and sheep are congregating along the road that winds away into the distance. The passage from the homely domesticity of the foreground scene to the distant spectacle of loch and castle and snow-capped mountains is an allegory of the drovers' adventurous journey into the wilds.",
