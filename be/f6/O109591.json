Her costumes contained sufficient information to indicate character, period and style without being either over-detailed or indefinite.  Thus, this costume for a poor flower seller in 1890s Paris from Frederick Ashton's ballet Nocturne, contains enough hints of period in the sleeves and swathed hips to satisfy the audience while not getting in the way of the dancer.  The grey velvet too is subtly chosen to suggest hardwearing poverty, but at the same time it has a chic that suggests a balleticised destitution, in keeping with Ashton's nostalgic, romantic view of the subject.  \nFonteyn's interpretation, however, conveyed all the sadness and confusion of the poor girl in love with a rich man.  She danced the role for ten years until the ballet passed out of the repertory.  The costume was later sold at an auction in aid of the Royal Academy of Dancing and was bought by ballet historian and Science Museum curator G B L Wilson.  In 1970, Wilson lent the costume back to Fonteyn to wear when she danced a solo from Nocturne in the Gala marking Ashton's retirement as Director of The Royal Ballet.  Suffice it to say that, after more than twenty years, the costume needed no alteration.",

The music was Frederick Delius's Paris suite and the scenery & costumes were designed by Sophie Fedorovitch.  \nSome years after the ballet passed out of the repertory, the costume was sold at an auction in aid of the Royal Academy of Dancing (of whcih Fonteyn was then President).  It was bought by G B L Wilson, ballet historian and Curator at the Science Museum.  Wilson later became head of the British Theatre Museum Association and donated the costume to the Museum.\n[Theatre costume] The dress was last worn when the then owner, G B L Wilson, lent it to Fonteyn to wear at the Frederick Ashton Gala in 1970.",
