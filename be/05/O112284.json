The Museum register records that it was in a 'case illustrating manufactures from black ox horn'.  The date of manufacture is not recorded, but it is probably 19th-century. It has a paper label on the bottom saying \u2018Drinking cup Madeira 802\u2019.  \n\nItems from the Great Exhibition formed the basis of an \u2018Animal Products\u2019 collection, which was formed at the suggestion of Prince Albert, consort of Queen Victoria.  He advised on the formation of the South Kensington Museum and suggested a collection of manufactured items made of natural raw materials, divided into animal, vegetable and mineral categories.  The Animal Products collection was displayed at the branch museum in Bethnal Green, in the East End of London, when it opened in 1872.",

Much of the material came from the Great Exhibition, and the collections continued to be added to until 1917. Less than half of the Animal Products Collection survived by 2000.  Half had been transferred to different departments and half remained at Bethnal Green. In 2000 departments at the V&A were offered suitable items.  Another quarter of the original collection was trasferred, the remainder was offered to the Archive of Art and Design, at Blythe House, along with the original registers.  BGMC kept a small selection of other items for display in conjunction with the History of the Museum information panel.\n\nThis cup was probably acquired for the Great Exhibition as it does not have a year of acquisition (information from Catherine Howell). It was displayed in a 'case illustrating manufactures from black ox horn' and was described as 'drinking cup Madeira horn'.",
