Glass with intense, deep colours was popular in England during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. During the second quarter of the 19th century it was generally replaced by lighter colours, sometimes achieved through colour-overlays. While late 18th-century coloured glass is more widely found, early 19th-century examples are much rarer. Coloured glass of this period is usually only represented by blue or purple drinking glasses or dark green 'roemers' for white wine. Like this decanter these are decorated with relief-moulded 'raspberry prunts'. Green roemers were used throughout much of Europe during the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. Their rustic style enjoyed a strong revival during the second half of the 19th century, here it is very interesting to see how it was adapted for a very different taste in Regency Britain of the early-19th century.",
