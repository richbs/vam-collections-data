In particular, flat-chased decoration of this type is characteristic of French silver of the second quarter of the century (Dennis, 1960, cat. nos. 22, 53, 271,Schroder, 1988, p. 590).\n\nProvenance: probably Victor Amadeus II, Duke of Savoy; by descent to King Umberto II of Italy; S.

            "historical_context_note": "Warming pans were filled with hot coals and passed across the bed linen quickly enough to avoid the risk of fire. They were generally made of brass, and elaborately pierced and engraved examples survive from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. In silver, they were items of the greatest luxury; only a very small number were made, and fewer have survived.",
