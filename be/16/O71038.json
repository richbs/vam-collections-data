Two angels (mostly missing) at the top centre of the panel hold a small nude figure, hands held together, representing the saint's soul. At the bottom centre of the panel the saint's emblem, the Agnus Dei, is represented lying on the ground.\n\nThe left arm and the face of the lower right angel are damaged. The right leg and the top of the head of the saint's soul are missing, as is the head of the Lamb and the cross. The top of the panel has been cut back and the two top corners have been severely trimmed diagonally. Traces of gilding remain in the hair of the saint. The panel is weathered and stained dark brown. The back of the panel has been carefully carved with an elaborate coat of arms and dated '1656' and bears the initials 'REM.' There are four holes, three of which have large lead plugs with the remains of attached wire.",

In the bottom part of the panel, the Saint's emblem, the Agnus Dei is represented lying on the ground. \n\nThe left arm and face of the lower right angel are damaged and the right leg and top of the head of the saint's soul are missing. The top of the panel has been cut back and the top two corners have been severely trimmed diagonally. \n\nAlabaster, a fine grained form of gypsum, is a smooth marble-like stone that became popular during the late Middle Ages for the carving of religious sculpture. Softer than marble, it was much easier to carve and also considerably cheaper. England was an important European centre of alabaster production, with quarries outside Nottingham, York, Burton-on-Trent and London. From about 1380s, alabasters - both single devotional images and reliefs for altarpieces - were exported in considerable numbers to the continent where they were to survive, whereas in England such images were destroyed during the Reformation.",
