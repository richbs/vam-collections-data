            "public_access_description": "This small stained-glass panel was probably ordered from the workshop of Veit Hirschvogel in Nuremberg by Conrad IV Haller von Hallerstein, who owned the 'House of the Golden Shield'' on the Schildgasse in that city. The panel was located in the private chapel of the house with some others, including an Adoration of the Magi. We know this from a watercolour made of the windows in the chapel in 1854.\n\nThe story of the birth of Christ is found in the Gospels of the New Testament. From a very early date in Christian history, artists took various elements from these Gospels to form the image of the Nativity that is so familiar to us today.\n\nThe earliest images show Mary lying down, sometimes in what appears to be a cave, with the Christ Child swaddled in a crib by her side. Joseph appears in the background. In the later Middle Ages this type of representation began to change to the form we see depicted in this panel. \n\nHere the Virgin Mary and Joseph kneel in adoration of the Christ Child, who lies on the ground between them. This change in the way that artists portrayed the Nativity is often attributed to the visions experienced by a Swedish woman, Bridget (about 1304-73). She recorded them in a book known as 'Revelations'. One of her visions portrayed the Nativity of Christ as we see it here.",
