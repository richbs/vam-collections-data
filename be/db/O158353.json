Hogarth's work ranged from realistic portraiture to satirical sequential art, in an early comic strip-like style. Much of his work, though at times vicious, poked fun at contemporary politics and customs.\n\nIn this etching, the caricatured audience in the 'cheap seats' is watching an exaggeratedly funny play. They are separated from the orchestra by a wooden partition with large spikes to discourage them from climbing over, a practice that was not unheard of, particularly if the play was dull. The foreground shows three members of the orchestra, one of whom has removed his wig for comfort.\n\nBehind the laughing audience are two more smartly-dressed gentlemen who have paid for a box and so have more space. Neither shows any interest in what is happening on stage, or even in buying oranges, since both are evidently set on a different form of entertainment.\n\nThis print was originally used as a subscription ticket for prints of Southwark Fair and A Rake's Progress. It features Hogarth's signature and wax seal in the bottom right hand corner.",
