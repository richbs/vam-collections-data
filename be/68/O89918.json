The chess-board has squares of cloudy amber alternating with squares of clear amber placed over coloured foil. Soldiers in contemporary costume are depicted on the foil. Six small medallions of pierced ivory reliefs under clear amber probably depict scenes from Ovid. The backgammon board is profusely ornate and depicts four Virtues: Justice, Hope, Temperance and Fortitude.\n\nThe board consists of two hinged parts. The front of the outside consists of:\n1) a space arranged for merelles or nine-mens'-morris. The centre square consists of clear amber over an ivory relief in a framework of etched gold, surrounded by a band of engraved ivory.  The eight other spaces are in cloudy amber divided by borders of clear amber over foil with gilt arabesques.\n2) two groups of two long panels of cloudy amber set with panels of clear amber over ivory reliefs and etched gold foil\n3) a border of turtle shell backed with gold foil. The various divisions of the surface are marked by bands of engraved ivory. \n\nThe back is similarly arranged for chess, the chequers composed of alternate clear and cloudy amber. The former are backed with designs of warriors etched on gold foil. \n\nThe sides are of turtle shell set over foil, edged with ivory.\n\nThe inside of the board is decorated with various designs in clear and cloudy amber with ivory banding and stringing. The backgammon points, of clear amber edged with ivory on a background of cloudy amber, are alternately set against black of crimson foil with gold arabesques. Between the points the board is set with floral roundels and heads in relief. Across the centre of each half are bands of ivory with oval quatrefoil panels of amber bearing inscriptions (see below). Between these bands and along the borders of the two halves of the board are panels of cloudy amber edged with ivory and set with clear amber panels over ivory reliefs and various designs in gold on foil.",
