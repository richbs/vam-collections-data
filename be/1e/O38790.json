The front shows two boys climbing a ropework trellis: one wears a red and white hooped T-shirt and blue jeans, the other a red and blue checked shirt and tan shorts; the wording reads\nTODAY YOU'RE 9\nwith the enlarged figure nine in gold foil printed in red.  The inside of the card has a pop-up group of vaulting horse, boxing gloves and football, and the verse reads:\nHi, there !  Little sportsman,\nSo the great day's really here;\nMay it be a perfect knock-out,\nBest time in all the year.         \nThere'll be lots of birthday games, \nAnd super presents, too,\nTo make today the nicest yet,\nA record one all through.",
