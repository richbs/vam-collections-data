Design for a portion of a Diorama of Killarney, exhibited Christmas 1862.<i>\nWater-colour.\n</i>E.496-1926\nPresented by William Telbin, Esq.\n\nThe diorama was described on the following day in <i>The Times</i>:\n\n\"But even this scene (Falls of Garrawalt by Mr Grieve) is almost exceeded in effect by a series of panoramic views on the Lakes of Killarney that glide past the eyes in succession. These are painted by Mr. Telbin from sketches recently made on the spot. Nothing so perfect of its kind has ever been produced on the stage. The effects of light, shade and perspective are literally magical. They are more like the transcripts of nature in the stereoscope, enormously magnified and coloured with a skill 'beyond the reach of art' than actual works of the pencil. The surface of the water and the shadows in its depths are both exquisitely given and how so much delicacy has been preserved on such a scale of magnitude is difficult to conceive, certainly the effect is impossible to describe. There are six of these splendid views, The Lower Lake from Castle Lough, Kenmare Cottage in Glena Bay; the old Weir Bridge; Dunday Bay in the Middle Lake; and Murcross Abbey by Moonlight. The view of Dunday Bay has a mournful interest now, from the fact that the artist, in making the original sketch for it in October last, introduced in the foreground the Royal Family Party, who had visited the same spot a short time previously. He thought a pictorial reference to that visit, not obtrusively or vulgarly made, would be appreciated by the public. The event that has thrown such a shadow over the nation caused a doubt, whether the Royal group should be preserved in the view. But Mr. Telbin appears to have been of an opinion that the original sketch might well be given as it was drawn; it now embodies a memory of a happier time.\"\n\n(&lt;I&gt;Note&lt;/i&gt;: At the time of the Queen's visit to Ireland she was in mourning for her mother, the Duchess of Kent. The Prince Consort was still alive.)'",
