He also defined a new business model in the post-war fashion industry by establishing Dior as a global brand across a wide range of products. Eventually, menswear was added to this list.\n\nThis white cotton dress shirt was given to the Victoria and Albert Museum by Sir Roy Strong, as part of a navy pinstripe three-piece Tommy Nutter suit. An author, broadcaster, former Director of the National Portrait Gallery and from 1974 to 1987, Director and Secretary of the V & A, Sir Roy was a high-profile figure renowned for his sartorial flair. Sir Roy tended to wear the suit for public and formal occasions in his capacity as Museum Director.",
