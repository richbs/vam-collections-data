In 1747, which is about the time that this pot was made, the tax on tea imported from China was greatly increased, and the official figures for imports fell accordingly. However, a good deal of tea was smuggled in.\n\nMaterials & Making\nChelsea porcelain of this date has a glassy composition. This could not withstand the thermal shock of contact with boiling water, so the teapot probably had to be slowly warmed up before use. Partly because of the limitations of the material, and partly out of preference, the Chelsea management made few tea wares, and concentrated on ornamental pieces and dessert wares.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe moulded pattern was probably inspired by pieces from the French porcelain factory at Chantilly. Chelsea made cream jugs, tea bowls, coffee pots and beakers with this moulding.\n\nTrading\nThe Chelsea factory aimed at the top end of the market. It sold its wares from the factory premises, from factory-run warehouses in the West End of London, through London ceramics dealers, and at auctions held in London, Dublin and probably elsewhere.",
