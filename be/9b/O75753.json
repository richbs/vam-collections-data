An engraving of the statue was published in The Illustrated London News, 15 December 1866, p. 584. A plaster bust of Seaton by Adams dated 1863 is in the National Portrait Gallery, London. A marble bust related to the plaster in the National Portrait Gallery was formerly in the United Services Club, London.\n\nSeaton (1778-1863) was a British field marshal and colonial governor.\n\nGeorge Gammon Adams (b. 1821-1898) was a portrait sculptor and medallist. He designed and exhibited prize medals for the Great Exhibition. In 1852 he was chosen to model the death mask of Wellington. One of his public monuments is the 'Napier' statue in Trafalgar square.\n\nThe statuette was among the items given to the Museum by I. D. Adams, the daughter of  George Gammon Adams, in 1980. In total, 196 items were included in the Adams gift, which consisted of many models for medals as well as the busts and figurative sculpture. In most instances it is not possible to date conclusively the many models included in this gift.",
