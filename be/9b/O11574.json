It seems to have no parallels in glass, however.\n\nPeople\nJohn Dwight (born about 1633, died 1703), founder of the Fulham Pottery, London, was constantly attempting to refine his stoneware and raise its status. In this rare example of 'marbled porcellane', which was covered in his second patent of 1684, he (or most probably a potter under his supervision) exploited the possibilities of integrating a band of stained clays into the body of the pot. Although Dwight's pottery was fairly successful, his pioneering fine stonewares could never compete with the increasing import of Chinese blue-and-white porcelain.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe techniques of using  marbled clay bands and small brass moulds to apply contrasting 'sprigged' decoration (sprigging involved pressing wet clay into fired-clay moulds to  produce designs in relief)  was not taken up in Staffordshire until about 40 years later. Whether or not they copied Dwight's early experiments is not known.",
