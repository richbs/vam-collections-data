These clasps come in a small number of basic shapes including stylised tulips as here.  The women who owned them sewed them onto cloth belts which they made themselves, usually richly embroidered.  \n\nThis clasp is set with pieces of grooved coral, known as \u2018finger nails\u2019, which are typical of the work of Saphrampolis, in northern Anatolia. They were traded throughout the Balkans, and were highly esteemed.  Although the clasp appears to be made of gilded silver it is in fact copper, thickly plated first with silver, and then gold.  This technique was very common in the Balkans in the 19th century.",
