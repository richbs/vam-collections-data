Through geometric cutting and the exploitation of the linear qualities of the pleats, which are often placed at different angles, Miyake has created two- and three- dimensional shapes.  The garment is designed to move with the wearer, assuming independent forms which neither disguise nor reveal the body.\n\nMiyake displayed his 1990 collection in an influential exhibition in which dresses were shown on three-dimensional mannequins as well as spread flat on the floor.  This particular dress has a rectangular shape when laid out flat.",
