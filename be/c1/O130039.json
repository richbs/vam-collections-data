They were used in pairs, one to contain water and the other wine. The letters here engraved on the top indicate which liquid was kept inside.   A and V represent the Latin words for water (aqua) and wine (vinum).\n\nThese cruets are unusual in that their bodies have been carved from amber, a valuable and luxurious material. In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, towns such as Bruges and Lubeck started to specialize in the carving and turning of amber. This developed from the work of rosary bead makers, who formed important guilds in these towns from 1302 and before 1360 respectively. Raw amber came from the Baltic, from where it would have been imported by the Hanseatic merchants, who had important bases in towns like Bruges and Lubeck.",
