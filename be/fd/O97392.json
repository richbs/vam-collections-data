            "public_access_description": "A cinquedea is a large dagger with a double-edge triangular blade very wide at the hilt and fluted in straight lines from the hilt towards the point. The quillons (crossbars to guard the hand) are short and curve slightly towards the blade. The name cinquedea is derived from the width of the blade which was supposed to be five fingers wide at the hilt.\n\nThe cinquedea was a civilian sword carried horizontally at the back in a belt and housed in a leather or cloth-covered scabbard. It was placed horizontally so that it could be drawn easily by the right hand. It was used primarily as a thrusting weapon designed for close combat and self defence. There are very few variations in form but they were produced in a range of sizes. Most fall between daggers and short swords in length. Many had their blades etched and gilt and a few traces remain on this one.",
