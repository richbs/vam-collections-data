On the left stands St. Joachim in a clasped mantle with a heavy earmine hood, and onj the right St. Anne in a turban like headdress, on elappet of which she holds in her hand.

The altar-piece was probably a side-altar in a church.\n\nIt shows the marriage or betrothal of the Virgi Maryn, although the Bible does not in fact mention this episode. Here the high priest Zacharias joins the right hands of the Virgin and the elderly St Joseph with the end of his stole.  St Joachim stands on the left and St Anne on the right. \n\nThe relief was made about 1450. It has kept much of its original colour and gilding but it has been retouched in places. Joseph's robe is particularly interesting. It was once a stronger purple colour, and the sculptor has applied tiny copper domes over painted dots to make the surface more lively.",
