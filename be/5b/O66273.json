By 1900 they were making thousands of bentwood chairs every year, to furnish caf\u00e9s and offices, as well as private houses. The architect and designer Josef Hoffmann, a leading figure in the Austrian design-reform movement known as the Vienna Secession, and a founder of the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte (Vienna Workshops), used this established and cheap technology to create furniture in an entirely new style. Both the form and decoration of this chair use simple geometric forms. It was originally designed by Hoffmann for the Purkersdorf Sanatorium, one of the Werkst\u00e4tte's most complete commissions, but it later went into commercial production.",
