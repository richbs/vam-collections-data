One was the extent of Germany's post-war territories and the other was the amount of reparations that Germany as the defeated nation should pay her former opponents.  Although Germany signed, they did not intend to pay and only did when forced to do so. The French Prime Minister Poincar\u00e9 decided in 1923 to send the French army to occupy the Ruhr, the major industrial region of Germany.The German Government ordered its workers to maintain `passive resistance'. The result of the strikes and the halt to industrial production was that inflation soared. A loaf of bread went from 1 mark in value to 3 billion marks by the end of the year. There was no attempt by the German Government to match taxation to expenditure and rationing was not introduced. The result was virtual starvation for many people. The Germans gave in by the end of the year, agreed to pay reparations and balanced expenditure with taxation. Inflation slowed rapidly and trade recovered. In the end the Germans paid 1.9% of their National income in reparations and received in Foreign loans (never repaid) two and a half times what they paid out in reparations.",
