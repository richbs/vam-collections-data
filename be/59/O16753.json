However, its relatively late date, and the fact that it was produced in south-east India rather than a north Indian centre of Mughal culture, mean that the design has taken on a new form. The border design of flowers and parrots is typical of textiles made around Masulipatam, north of Madras on the so-called Coromandel Coast, and this is almost certainly where this piece was made. \n\nThe motif of the flowering plant emerging from a tiny vase is similar to that seen on other south Indian tent hangings made for Tipu, Sultan of Mysore (d.1799).",
