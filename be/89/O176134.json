Bench ends often carry a distinctive carved 'poppy head', from the French 'poupee' (figurehead).  Many are variations on the fleur-de-lis, a symbol of purity often associated with the Virgin Mary. Forming the elbow of this bench-end is a seated dragon, symbol of the Devil. In the context of a church building, monstrous creatures were probably intended to ward off evil thoughts.\n\nThis bench end came from a Suffolk church and corresponds very closely in style with those still in situ at Stowlangtoft and Barningham villages churches in Suffolk. For this reason it is likely that it was supplied by the same (unidentified) workshop in the nearby town of Bury St Edmunds.",

Clifford Smith noted (21/11/11) that 'they are reputed to have come from East Anglia: but the owners are unable to state their provenance precisely...A portion of one of the poppy heads, & the head of one of the animals has been restored, they appear otherwise to be in original condition.'\n\nFrom a Suffolk church. Charles Tracy noted that this bench end and W.95-1911 correspond in style with those at Stowlangtoft and Barningham in Suffolk, and must be of the same workshop. Given the proximity of both parishes to Bury St Edmonds, and the date given to the Stowlangtoft benches (1450-1500), an attribution to an unidentified Bury workshop seems reasonable.",
