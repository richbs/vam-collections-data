Tanabe produced a pen drawing of the feathers which were then photocopied onto the final paper. He used an iron to apply gold leaf to the photocopied drawing and then drew in areas of the headdress using black pen and white pencil crayon. \n\nTanabe, who was born in  Kanagawa, Japan, is inspired by traditional Japanese woodcuts. He has produced fashion illustrations for a wide range of newspapers and magazines including The New York Times Magazine, British Vogue and Vogue Paris, and Harper's Bazaar.",
