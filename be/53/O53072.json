As well as furniture, the workshop produced architectural woodwork, and Pugin based his designs on Tudor or Jacobean examples, as well as using the Gothic style associated with his later furniture. This table, stamped A.PUGIN under the top, is one of the few surviving examples of furniture from Pugin's business. The design of the base, with legs formed of columns and arches on scrolling feet, is inspired by Tudor sources although no sixteenth-century table looked like this. Evidence of later alterations to the edge and underside of the table top, and the size of the top in relation to the base, suggest that the table might originally have been larger, possibly with two sets of legs, and intended as a dining or library table.",
