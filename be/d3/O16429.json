Apprenticed to a printer at Hull, moved to London 1805, entered the RA Schools 1807 and studied with Sir Thomas Lawrence. Early works were mainly portraits and nude studies; his first large figure composition was 'The Coral Finder' (1820). Exhibited 138 works at the RA between 1811 and 1850, and 77 at the BI 1811-47. Travelled abroad in 1815/6, 1822, and 1830, principally to Paris and Italy. Elected ARA 1824, RA 1828. A retrospective exhibition was held at the Society of Arts 1849. Died York 13 November 1849. His studio sale was at Christie's 6-10 and 13-14 May 1850. Most admired in his lifetime for his large mythological subjects, but now perhaps more appreciated for his less finished and smaller studies of the nude. \n\nLIT: A Gilchrist <i>Life of William Etty</i> 2 vols, 1855; W Gaunt and F G Roe <i>Etty and the Nude</i> Leigh-on-sea 1943; D Farr <i>William Etty</i> 1958 \n\n<b>The Deluge</b> \n225-1871 Negs GJ836, 69198 \nMillboard laid on panel, enlarged on all sides, 63.5 x 68.6 cm (25 x 27 ins) \nGiven by Charles T Maud 1871 \n\nDated by Farr to about 1835-45 on stylistic grounds. This kind of 'bather' picture was favoured by Etty particularly in the 1840s. In the 1907 catalogue, it is described as being signed on the back, and dated 1815; this is presumably a reference to the two autograph letters which were given with the painting in 1871. The letters, now almost illegible, are from Coney Street, York, (where in 1845 Etty visited a house which he bought the following year), to ?W H Ealy, and dated 'Monday 18th Dec 1815' and 'Shortest Day' respectively. The letters were transcribed by Basil Long earlier this century: \n\nMy Dear Sir, \nI have just completed your Picture and if it turns up 'a Trump' it has proved itself worth the trouble and expense of its extension [see medium description above] - [-?] when it is dry enough to travel, am I to send it to you or Mr. Peel? Pray tell me - \nYours truly, Wm Etty \n\nMr Dear Sir, \nYour half note <i>safely</i> arrived this morning. Mr Andrews [-?] Mr Wass the Engraver from London and the cognoscenti here are delighted with the Deluge Figure and efforts will I think be made to get it - but I will tell you candidly - you will be a <i>Donkey</i> if you part with it that is <i>flat</i> - as we say in Yorkshire - it is a fine thing - tho I say it so take care of it - and dont fool it away. \nYours sincerely, Wm Etty \n\nPROV: Probably Charles Oddie, his sale, Christie's 18 March 1854 (115, 'The Deluge: a female figure, drawn and coloured with grand effect, and 3 ALs.s [autograph letters] of Etty related to it'), bought in \u00a331 10s; William Wethered, his sale, Christie's 27 February 1858 (60, 'The Deluge: female lying on a rock'), bought by the dealer Richard Colls \u00a324 3s; not in the C T Maud sale, Christie's 21 May 1864, but presented by him to the museum 1871\n \nREPR: C H Collins Baker <i>British Painting</i> 1933, pl 120\"",
