The particular favour for archaic bronzes and jades encouraged the production of  contemporary objects in an 'archaic' style. Fakes also made their appearance as a consequence of the growing demands in the art market. \n\nThis bronze vase is a composite object made of several parts inlaid with gold and silver and soldered together. The two cylinders, probably chariot fittings, date to the Western Han dynasty (206 BC-AD 8), while the bases and the zoomorphic mount were added many centuries later, maybe between the Song and early Ming dynasties (1368-1644). A red and green patination, applied at the end, gave the surface a uniform 'archaic' appearance.",
