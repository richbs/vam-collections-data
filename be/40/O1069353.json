Graham Reynolds, independently, but the relationship had already been noticed by Foster, (1) connected the latter with the signed Hoskins portrait of Charles I in the Pierpont Morgan Library (2) and attributed the whole group confidently to Hoskins: 'The styles agree entirely' (3)  \n \nThe coherence of the group, which includes a miniature by another hand in the collection of the Marquis of Anglesey, may be due, as David Piper pointed out, (4) to derivation from a common original, possibly the portrait by Daniel Mytens. This type of portrait of the King evidently prevailed from about 1629 to 1631, the earlier date appearing on a signed Mytens portrait now in the Metropolitan Museum, New York, and the later on a version signed and dated by Cornelius Jonson at Chatsworth. A Mytens studio version is in the National Portrait Gallery. (5)  \n \nPurely on an argument of style, this miniature probably relates most closely to signed Hoskins miniatures such as the Viscount Falkland at Windsor and the Dudley, 3rd Baron North in the National Portrait Gallery. (5) The similarity in the painting of the flesh, especially in the dark granular stipple of the facial hair and shadowing, give some anchor for the Charles I in Hoskins' development of the 1620s.Yet there is, as Carl Winter recognised, a connection with the Olivers precisely in this manner of stippling (7) which leaves room if not for doubt, at least for consideration of the degree of collaboration between Peter Oliver and John Hoskins in the 1620s. By 1630, however, the styles were divergent, as can be seen by comparing the image with the signed and dated Peter Oliver portrait of Charles I (Buccleuch Collection), apparently a different type from this miniature.  \n \n1 Foster 1914-16, vol.
