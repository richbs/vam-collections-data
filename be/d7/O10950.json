Buffet displays were intended to demonstrate wealth and status.\n\nDesign & Technique\nThe principal decoration on this elaborate piece comprises bands of applied wire, known as filigree work. In this technique, a fine metal wire is formed into intricate designs, usually of geometric or foliate form. They are then soldered on to the object. The filigree is complemented by bands of engraving. On the cover these depict birds and animals in a landscape. On the body there are hunting scenes, and on the base  fruit and flower stems.\n\nDesign Sources & Maker\nAlthough made in London, this cup is unlikely to have been made by an Englishman, for a number of reasons. Filigree work is associated with south German and eastern European goldsmiths' work, and is rarely found in English silver. The surviving examples of English filigree work are so similar in technique that they can be attributed to the same maker as this piece. The engraving is based on Northern European print sources, and the maker's mark is a combination of initials characteristic of Flemish names. The maker's mark is otherwise unrecorded in London, and it is probable that he was working in London only for a short period of time.",

ISBN 1851773088.\nThis handsome cup, recognised as English at the time of its acquisition in 1859 (for \u00a3260), has long been greatly admired as an example of goldsmiths' work. The cup's decoration, with its intricate bands of vine scrolls alternating with engraved hunting scenes, was clearly appreciated from the outset. The cup was copied in electrotype as early as 1863, and by 1881 it was on view with other especially precious examples of goldsmiths' work and enamels in the Prince Consort gallery, indeed being one of the pieces singled out in Baedeker's guide.\nThe TvL cup was made by an unidentified goldsmith, most likely one of many Flemish makers active in London during a period when foreigners, more rigorously trained in drawing and technical skills, could offer rich effects that were appreciated by English patrons. This artisan's technique of creating and laying down fine wires and cast leaves for the vine scrolls is unusual and closer to the workmanship of a jeweller than of a silversmith.\nThe covered standing cup was the principal type of display plate in early modern Europe; because so many were preserved by museums, a disproportionate number of such cups have survived. The cup had special significance as a gift, with its use governed by rules of ceremony.  \n\nLit.
