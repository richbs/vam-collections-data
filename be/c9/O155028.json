It is a superbly presented drawing, the figure standing on the paved floor against the base of a column, and executed in subtle tones of grey highlighted in gold and red.  It is extremely unusual to find a design executed almost wholly in pencil, but it conveys exactly the right sense of time and place.  The fabric samples show how the designer wanted the costume made; the coat in a heavy dull black suede, with the touches of red and the fine striped fabric.  It is at once sombre and very masculine and the suede avoids the density of black, which can create a dead area when on stage.",
