It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years.  Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn\u2019t needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nStand-up comedian Ken Dodd learned his trade in the tradition of music hall and variety, starting out in 1952 in Liverpool as a member of Don Ellis's Fairfield Concert Party, and topping the bill two years later at the Hull Palace as 'the North's New Star Comedian'.  His first break in pantomime came at the Bradford Alhambra in 1959, and he became known more widely through television where his 'Diddy Men' and 'Tickling Stick' became a trademark of his act.  Dodd had hugely admired the northern comics of the 1940s, of whom he once said:  'I think they left me to switch the light off. I am the last one.  They've all gone. Frank Randle, Norman Evans. Max Miller.  They're my heroes.  They're my boys.'",
