When not in use, it could be hung up using the suspension ring.\n\nBy about 1800, some toasting forks had telescopic handles with some three to four slides so the length could be reduced when the fork was not in use. The silver handles were sometimes engraved with decoration, the owner\u2019s initials or a dedication from a donor. This fork is marked FG.",
