Nevertheless, it is one of the most expert examples of Alexander Cooper's work. At this late date, the combination of the solid blue background and the bright rose colour of the costume would have seemed unconventional. It is more reminiscent of 16th-century miniatures than the ones that English miniaturists produced from the mid-1630s. These usually epitomised the sophisticated Baroque manner of Sir Anthony Van Dyck. Unconventional colour combinations and the use of unusual background colours distinguish Alexander Cooper's style.",

Its present appearance, which is not impressive as to condition, probably belies its original vividness. The combination of the blue background with the bright rose colour of the costume would have seemed unconventional, reminiscent of the Tudor tradition rather than the sophisticated Flemish Baroque to which the English miniaturists had assimilated by the mid-1630s. It must have been very striking. Unconventional colour combinations and the use of unusual background colours are regarded as distinctive of Alexander Cooper's style.  \n \nThere has been some slight question over the identification. Whitcomb Greene knew the portrait as Charles Louis, but Williamson seems to have questioned this, and he may have been responsible for the suggestion that the sitter was Prince Rupert. Foster failed to mention it in his main listing and included it only in his appendix of sale records. By the time of its appearance at Sotheby's, and notwithstanding Goulding's acceptance of the Charles Louis identification, the portrait was catalogued as Prince Rupert. Long worked on the question, citing a Van Dyck portrait of Charles Louis in the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, and commented tortuously that it 'does not seem to differ sufficiently in features from this miniature to make it certain that the painting and miniature do not represent the same person'. (1) Staring pointed to the original Whitcomb Greene identification and cited the two portraits of Charles Louis in the Buccleuch Collection.(2) Graham Reynolds accepted his view and labelled the miniature accordingly.  \n \nIf of Charles Louis, the date would have to be before 1633, when he was installed as KG. The deep and rounded scallops in the Flemish bobbin-lace of the collar are right for c.1632.(3) This miniature seems thus to be the principal extant version of an image originating from Alexander Cooper himself, which is followed by the unsigned Buccleuch miniature.(4) The other Buccleuch miniature also seems to be an independent type, perhaps a year or two earlier; and A G Reynolds (5) cites a 'comparable portrait ... at Windsor, possibly by N. Thach'.(6) As likenesses they are all compatible with the accepted full-size images of Charles Louis, for example Van Dyck's double portrait with Prince Rupert in the Louvre, a Mierevelt of 1634 at Hardwick Hall, Derbyshire, and another fairly common type, probably a Van Dyck design, of which there was a version in the collection ofCornelia, Countess of Craven (National Gallery).
