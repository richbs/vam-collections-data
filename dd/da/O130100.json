In His left hand Christ holds a scroll, while His right hand is raised in blessing. An ivory figure of a Magus in the Dorset County Museum clearly belongs with this piece, being very close in size and style. The group is cracked and has flakled in many places, the most noticeable loss being the Virgin's right shoulder. The holes pierced in the eyes would probably have been filled with jet or glass beads, and the piece has been stained a grey-purple colour. The back is plain.",

It is likely that the magus was originally the second of the three kings. The ivories were probably attached to a separate background, possibly of a contrasting material such as gilt-copper, and the whole was possibly intended for a shrine or small reredos, but this must remain as speculation.\nA striking iconographic and stylistic parallel is provided by the limestone relief of the Virgin and Child in York Minster. Especially the unusual position of the Child - more a boy than a child -  with his knees across the Virgin's right wrist, his large right hand and with two elongated fingers raised ion blessing, is virtually identical, as the way the Virgin holds him under his body. It is likely that there was a model, which must have been especially venerated in England around the middle of the 12th century.",
