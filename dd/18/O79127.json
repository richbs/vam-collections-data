The form, decoration, size and material reflect the function of the pot, the geographical area in which it was produced and the status of the people for whom it was made.  The shape itself is derived from natural forms such as the gourd and the melon. Different types of pots are used to carry water from the well for everyday use, to store water, to drink water from and for  daily ablutions. They are also used as containers for sacred water or water that is to be used for ritual purposes.",
