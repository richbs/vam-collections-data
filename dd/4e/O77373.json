Catherine of Braganza, Charles's Portuguese wife, had a particular passion for tea and did much to popularise it. Tea was originally drunk in the Chinese manner, weak and without milk, but by the early 18th century sugar and milk were added and small spoons became necessary.\n\nTrading\nSpoons were made by specialist goldsmiths, but often supplied as part of a tea service. For example, a set made by Paul de Lamerie (1688-1751) in 1735 includes 12 tea spoons, a pair of sugar nippers, a strainer spoon, three canisters for black tea, green tea and sugar, and a cream jug. Very few full sets of matching spoons made before the 1740s are known today.\n\nSocial Usage\nTea spoons were part of the ritual of the tea table. They could be used to signal to the hostess when the guest had drunk his fill. In 1782 the Prince of Broglie reported that 'I partook of the most excellent tea and I should be even now still drinking it, I believe, if the Ambassador had not charitably notified me at the twelfth cup that I must put my spoon across it when I wished to finish with this sort of warm water'.",
