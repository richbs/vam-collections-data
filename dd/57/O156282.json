            "physical_description": "Plain weave cotton embroidered with silk in straight stitches. A strip of white cotton has been sewn along three sides [not the right hand side.  The embroidery has been cut along each edge, and there is no border on the left hand side.\nDirectional design with the top of the pattern at the bottom of the panel, so that the wearer saw the correct pattern. There is a border along the bottom: angled striped stems with a pink carnation or a blue flower with small grey flowers, or a grey flower with small blue flowers or a blue and yellow flower edged with pink.  All facing to the lower right.  There are narrow bands above, below and to the right hand side [this extends part way up the side of the panel], pink lines form small hexagons filled with dark green in their upper half and pink or yellow in their lower or outer half - like small bowls of fruit.\n\nThe main pattern is a series of diagonal lines from lower right to upper left.  These are chevron lines in dark green and blue.\n\nThere are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: blue and pink iris on yellow and green stems pointing to the upper right or lower left alternating with white blossom with blue centre pointing down or to the right.\n[2] wider stripes in two designs: [a] white ground with 4 diamond-shaped designs: central diamond shaped blue flower pointing up with other flowers around it; downward pointing pink flower with pointed petals and a group of 3 grey flowers above it; downward pointing blue diamond-shaped flower; a group of 3 grey flowers in the lower left of a diamond segment.\n[b] angled striped stem with downward pointing pink diamond-shaped flower with 5 grey flowers along it upper edges; small pink and blue vase with downward pointing spray of grey flowers and central pink flower; angled striped stem pointing right with segmented blossom; pin k and blue vase pointing right with spray of grey flowers slightly different from the previous one.\n\nThreads: silk; 2S; red, pink, yellow, white, dark green, green, grey, blue, light blue.  The grey may have faded from something much stronger - perhaps purple and probably synthetic.",
