Andr\u00e9 Lavriller (1885-1958), the medallist, was working from a design provided by Alfred-Auguste Janniot (1889-1969), the sculptor of the reliefs on the memorial.\nJanniot's sculptural programme included a relief of the Rape of Europa, depicted on the right of the medal reverse, a classical subject rendered in a contemporary style and set in architecture based on a classical mausoleum. Janniot's strong reliefs exhibit the bold, geometric lines of the art d\u00e9co style.\nIn the years immediately following the First World War war memorials were designed and constructed throughout Europe. Some were erected on the battlefields themselves, others, as here, were situated in the home towns and cities of those of died, commemorating the sacrifice of the ordinary soldier.",
