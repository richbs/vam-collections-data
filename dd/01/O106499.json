Although the gemstone collection is not as comprehensive as that found at the Natural History Museum, it is of particular historic interest as its formation pre-dates the development of many synthetic stones and artificial enhancements. All the stones were mounted as rings before they came to the Museum.  Some are held in the Sculpture Section, other more elaborately mounted ones in the Metalwork Section.\n\nAs well as being a clergyman, collector and dillettante, the Reverend Townshend wrote poetry.  He met Robert Southey in 1815 and through him the Wordsworths, the Coleridges and John Clare.  He was a friend of Charles Dickens and dedicatee of his novel 'Great Expectations'.",
