The lid formed of two planks, with moulded ends and front edge (and originally with a cleat at each end, missing) and held on two nailed strap hinges (replacements for 3 original wire loop hinges). \nThe front with two large panels divided by a narrow band of chequer inlay. The upper rail carved with a running band of guilloche extending onto the upper parts of the front legs; the legs and lower rail carved with alternating small/large guilloche, with spiral carved rosettes. Two central muntins (with scratch mouldings) each with 3 stylised rosettes with opposing palmettes between. Each large panel is carved with a flattened lozenge (with a moulded triple border with alternativing star-shaped punch and a curved gouge blade), enclosing a rosette set within four interlaced circles. The back plain (muntins with scratch mouldings). The ends plain, with stopped mouldings on the stiles and rails.\nThe interior plain, the panels cut with a gentle chamfer.\nFour base boards run front to back, held with hand-made nails and bird's mouth joints.\nA dark stain overall. The oak appears to be relatively fast growth English.\nA ploughed groove runs to the ground on each leg: \nPR front - inside face\nPR rear - front face\nPL front - rear face\nPL rear - inside face\n\nRepairs and condition\nGenerally clean and tidy condition (light wear), but plausible. The feet with reasonable wear but no tipping. The pegs slightly oval and protruding.\nThe lock replaced but the escutcheon early, and the lock hasp replaced. The front of the till probably replacement. The interior with four modern hooks and a modern ring hasp on the till lid.",
