The pattern is made up of tesselating birds in flight.\n\nMarion Dorn came to England from San Francisco in the early 1920s. By the mid 1930s she was acclaimed as a leading freelance textile designer. She carried out commissions for the London hotels Claridge's and the Savoy, and for the ships Orion and the Queen Mary. In 1934 Dorn established her own firm in Bond Street. Her career was less successful after she returned to America in 1940.\n\nEdinburgh Weavers was set up in 1929 as the experimental design and marketing unit of the firm Morton Sundour Fabrics. It merged with the main weaving factory in 1930. Successfully directed by Alastair Morton, who had trained as an architect, painter and weaver, the firm was known for its avant-garde artist-designed woven textiles.",
