A number of  silver reliefs made using such a mould survive on fifteenth and sixteenth century objects from across Europe.\n\nHowever, a relief produced from a mould like this could just as likely be of tin or pastiglia. Such reliefs, once taken from the mould, could be applied to a wide variety of objects, many of them types of object that no longer survive. The late fourteenth century Italian author Cennino Cennini gives directions for producing tin reliefs from stone moulds, and suggests that, once gilded, they could be used to decorate walls, chests, stone, parade armour and almost any other type of decorative object. Low metal reliefs of this type were evidently once common, and formed an important link between the techniques used by metalworkers, furniture makers and painters.",

It was said to have been excavated in Florence. \n\nNothing is known of the early history of this piece.\n\nHistorical significance: This object is an important survival of a type of object that must once have been very common. The designs on this piece also reflect the kinds of quite fragile and ephemeral decoration that would have once graced a number of different sorts of object. Finally, it demonstrates the concern of artists to find ways of producing repeating patterns or decoration with the minimum of effort, in order to maximise production and profitability.",

            "production_note": "A number of similar reliefs survive in collections across Europe. Some, such as a relief in the Museo Civico, Bologna, are made of stone, whilst others, such as a pair of matrices in Norway (Tonsberg, Vestfold-Fylkesmuseum), are made of bronze. The style of the figures in the boat in the V&A relief, composed mainly of rounded blobs, can be parallelled in the praying figures of one of the Norwegian reliefs. However, the scene of the two women under a broadly Giottesque baldaquin, and the geometrical forms and grotesques of the reverse of the V&A relief would seem to suggest an Italian origin for this piece, probably Northern Italian, although the tradition that the relief was excavated in Florence means that we should not rule out a central Italian origin.", 
            "historical_context_note": "This object has sometimes been described as a mould for goldsmiths. It is true that goldsmiths did use moulds for reproducing relief ornament: a number of such reliefs can be seen on a late fourteenth century shrine of St Brigit in Vadstena, Sweden. However, a relief produced from a mould like this could just as likely be of tin or pastiglia. Such reliefs, once taken from the mould, could be applied to a wide variety of objects, many of them types of object that no longer survive. The late fourteenth century Italian author Cennino Cennini gives directions for producing tin reliefs from stone moulds, and suggests that, once gilded, they could be used to decorate walls, chests, stone, parade armour and almost any other type of decorative object. Low metal reliefs of this type were evidently once common, and formed an important link between the techniques used by metalworkers, furniture makers and painters.",
