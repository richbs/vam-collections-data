            "public_access_description": "Although commonly grouped with the Pop artists who emerged in Britain in the 1960s, David Hockney was less influenced in his image making by mass media, advertising and the consumer society than by his private life (his imagery often focuses on friends and familiar places), traditional literature and gay culture. The  Alexandria-born Greek Cavafy, whom he discovered in 1960, was one of his favourite poets. In 1966 Hockney travelled to Beirut  in search of the kind of atmosphere he imagined Alexandria would have had at the time when Cavafy was writing there. However the images which he ultimately made to illustrate a selection of Cavafy's poems are mostly of  young male couples which could have been made in many places apart from Egypt in the early 20th century. It is their simplicity and  frankness which reflect the quality of Cavafy's writing which appealed to Hockney. The portrait of the poet sets the scene for the ensuing illustrations. Hockney made this image as an alternative to the one which he finally chose for the published edition of  fourteen poems.",
