Tait suggests that Hornick might have borrowed  'the idea of this design from an Italian source, most probably from the work of an artist in the Florentine circle of Francesco Salviati (1510-63)' (Tait, 1986, page 168), but no precise source is identified.",

This toothpick has a suspension loop and would have been worn hanging from a chain around the neck, a custom which Lightbown describes as continuing into the late sixteenth century.  He illustrates a portrait of an unknown man by Alessandro Oliviero, late fifteenth century (Lightbown, 1992, page 236, fig. 125), who wears a gem-set toothpick linked by a pearl to a necklace formed of several strands of cord.",
