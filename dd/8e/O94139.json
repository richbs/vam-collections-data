            "historical_context_note": "With most Lombard sculptors it is almost impossible to say with any certainty which artist was responsible for carving an object. The structure of Lombard workshop was much more varied and complex than that of the Tuscan counterparts and each master organised the division of labour in a different way. Giovanni Antonio Amadeo was particularly complicated in that respect. Not only was he the master of his own workshop, with a large number of assistants, but he also formed partnerships with other masters and their workshops, as well as overseeing the large fabbriche at the Duomo and the Ospedale Maggiore in Milan and the Certosa di Pavia, among others.\nRegarding the Certosa di Pavia alone, he had stipulated a contract with four other sculptors: Lazzaro Palazzi, Giovanni Giacomo Dolcebuono, Giovanni Antionio Piatti and Angelo da Lecco. The commission for the fa\u00e7ade of the Certosa was then given to both Amadeo and the Mantegazza brothers, and each party was responsible for half of the fa\u00e7ade.\nHe worked in close partnership with Piatti, Dolcebuono and Benedetto Briosco on a variety of projects, that were too large for a single workshop.\n\nThe small size of this piece suggests a devotional piece.\n \nGiovanni Antonio Amadeo (1447-1522)\n Sculptor and architect, mainly active in Milan, Pavia, Bergamo and Cremona. \nHis professional success, in terms of the architectural and sculptural commissions and official appointments that he received, was far greater than that of any of his contemporaries in Lombardy in the late 15th century, including Bramante.\n\nBartolommeo Colleoni (1400-1475)\nItalian soldier of fortune, served the Venetian Republic for many years under Gonzaga and Francesco Sforaz. He defeated the Milanese at the battles of Brescia, Verona, and on Lake Garda. He transferred his services to the Milanese in 1443, but the suspicious nature of Visconti was awakened by his conduct, and he was imprisoned at Monza until the Duke died in 1447. He left the Milanese service in 1448, and returned to that of Venice; but dissatisfied at not having been appointed captain-general he again entered the Milanese service. The offer of increased pay brought him back once more to Venice, and in 1455 he was appointed captain-general for life. He died in 1475.\n\nThe Carthusian monastery was founded in 1390 by Giangaleazzo Visconti. Building began in 1396, however most of the work was done in the second half of the 15th century, while Francesco Sforza was Duke of Milan. The church was consecrated in 1497, but work continued until the 1550s. All the most renowned Lombard sculptors and architects of the time worked on the church and especially on its fa\u00e7ade, including the Mantegazza, Amadeo Briosco, Solari and the da Sesto brothers.",
