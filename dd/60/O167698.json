He feels sure it is rare and offers it for \u00a35.\n\n3 November 1909 Minute paper of Oliver Brackett, Report of Inspection\nThe chair is a high-backed of carved walnut with ornamental splat and cabriole legs with hoof feet.  It belongs to the period of William & Mary.  A similar chair, illustrated in Macquoid (Vol II fig.158) is at Hampton Court Palace.  He notes the chairs at Hampton Court were probably designed by Daniel Marot who came to England with William III - which accounts for its Dutch character.  The chair seems genuine and the museum does not have one of this type.  He recommends acceptance.\n\n12 November 1909 Purchase form\nThe condition is noted as \"chipped and cracked\".\n\n17 November 1909 Minute of Lehfeldt\nAlso compares this chair to one at Hampton Court.  He notes a difference in the rails which in this chair \"are probably later additions\".",
