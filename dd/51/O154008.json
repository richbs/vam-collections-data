Cloaks with contrasting linings such as this were highly fashionable between 1915 and 1920. The cloak was made by court dressmakers and milliners Russell & Allen of Bond Street, London. It belonged to Miss Heather Firbank (1888-1954) and is one of well over 100 items of clothing acquired by the museum from her wardrobe. The collection dates from around 1905-mid 1920s and features many of the top London fashion houses of the time.",
