In Alan Bennett's The Wind in the Willows at the National Theatre in 1990, all the characters, while recognisably animals, were also human types and Mark Thompson's witty costumes blended animal with human characteristics.  There was no use of 3-D heads; the animals were defined by make-up and evocative costumes. Young Billy and Tommy in their Norfolk jackets and lace up boots were Edwardian children, but their spiky hair and dark brown outfits were appropriate for hedgehogs. Portly the baby otter had a moustache to suggest an otter's whiskers while his 'fur' was an all-in-one swimming costume with buttons down the front. \n\nThe squaring of the top quarter of the design frames and focuses the characters.",
