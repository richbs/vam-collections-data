In Catholic belief the wine miraculously transforms into the blood of Christ during this service, and so chalices were usually made from precious metals, to reflect the precious status of their contents. \n\nIn the 16th century, Spanish goldsmiths demonstrated great inventiveness in the design of church silver. They often combined religious symbols and images with fashionable secular ornament, such as one might find on domestic vessels like ewers or dishes. This chalice from Burgos is decorated with embossed (hammered) leaves and the foot is entirely covered with a delicately pricked or dotted scrollwork pattern. One of the coats of arms enamelled on the foot shows the Cross, with bones and Christ's crown of thorns. The other shows the arms of the monastic Carmelite Order, who presumably commissioned and used this chalice.",

Money and labour were lavished on religious art and images played a central role in daily worship. To ensure that goldsmiths focused on work for the crown and the church, the authorities brought in a series of sumptuary laws that limited the secular display of gems and precious metals. \n\nBy 1550 the silver mines in Peru and Mexico were generating enormous wealth for Spain and feeding the traditional taste for massive silver forms. They included the custodia, a towering architectural canopy that was unique to Spain. It was paraded through parishes during the Corpus Christi festival to display the Sacred Host (consecrated bread). The custodia embodied many characteristics of Spanish church plate. It was sculptural, highly visible and richly imaginative in design. \n\nWith the Counter Reformation, Spain became a triumphant defender of a revitalised Catholic faith. Silver altar vessels and entire altars, processional crosses, custodias and sanctuary lamps frequently appeared in goldsmiths' contracts.",
