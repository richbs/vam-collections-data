Half of the design is highly finished, the other half is less detailed. The frame is vertically aligned with neoclassical moulding. From the bow on the top of the crest loop down husk festoons to an anthemion. There are two large acanthus scrolls on the crest. Continuing from the base of these are husk festoons which culminate, at the apron, with a bow.\n\n'No. 94' A design for an oval frame. Half of the design is highly finished, the other half is less detailed. The frame is vertically aligned. The frame features neoclassical moulding. A large urn finial sits on top of a base supported by s-scrolls. An animal head is sketched onto the base. From the squared urn handles fall husk festoons, through a large acanthus scroll on either side. The husk festoons then follow the line of the mirror and terminate in acanthus c-scrolls on the apron. There is a glass border on this mirror divided from the main section by bead and reel moulding and six paterae.\n\n'No. 93' Half a design for a girandole. An urn finial sits on a narrow base supported by scrolls. The handles of the urn are ram's heads and from their mouths fall husk swags, supported by leaf scrolls down the sides of the frame. The apron features husks and acanthus scrolls. One acanthus leaf at the bottom of the mirror sits on the glass.\n\n'No. 92' A design for a oval looking glass. Half of the design is highly finished, the other half is less detailed. The frame is vertically aligned with neoclassical moulding. A large urn finial sits on top of two c-scrolls. Animal heads flank the urns, their horns acting as handles. From their mouths fall husk festoons which are supported by acanthus scrolls around the sides. The mirror is sectioned off by an oval of foliage decoration. The apron features acanthus leaves and a patera.",

            "public_access_description": "This design is part of a group of over 900 drawings of frames, mainly for pier glasses, overmantels, and girandoles. Many of these workshop designs share similar characteristics such as leaf scrolls and festoons of husks. Most of them are numbered, contain information about who ordered them, the date, the price (written in code), the colour of the frame and the dimensions of the finished object. \n\nThe drawings from John Linnell's workshop survive over the period 1773 to 1783. From April 1773 to August 1778, the workshop produced about twelve pieces a month. Production decreased over the next two years to 3 or 4 pieces a month. In 1783 these designs were no longer produced.\n\nRobert Adam, a leading architect, was a key influence on the neoclassical designs of John Linnell. Linnell worked with Adam for the first time at Kedleston Hall, Derbyshire, and they worked together on a number of other occasions. In the early 1770s festoons of husks began to be used on pier glasses and they are very prominent within these workshop designs. \n\nJohn Linnell (1729-1796) was the son of the famous furniture maker William Linnell (ca. 1703-1763). Unlike most furniture makers, John Linnell gained a design education at the St. Martin's Lane Academy, which was founded by William Hogarth in 1735. In 1750, aged 21, he joined his father's firm as a designer. On his father's death in 1763, John Linnell took over the family firm. During his lifetime John Linnell produced high quality furniture, which rivalled that of other leading furniture makers such as Thomas Chippendale, John Cobb and William Ince and John Mayhew.",
