It was made by Wenzel Maler, one of the leading exponents of wax modelling in seventeenth-century Nuremburg, and depicts the Holy Roman Emperor, Rudolf II. The date of 1606 may suggest that the portrait is intended to comemorate the ending of the so-called Long War against the Ottomans, which was concluded in that year.",
