One odd nail hole in top.\nThe legs blind tenoned into the seat.\n\nEnds \nNo gilt traces\nNot high quality carving but not obviously 19c in character\n\nRepairs/damage\nRepair where stretcher meets one end (a natural weak point)\nBoth turned stretchers possibly replaced?\nSplits and worm in feet\nOne modern nail on the side of leg into stretcher to hold it in place, and one peg also used in the same way.\n\nOverall \nTimber could be 16c but I'm a bit sceptical. The caps on end of turned stretchers seem original, so profile of turnings may help date stool. We need to find analogies for comparison.",
