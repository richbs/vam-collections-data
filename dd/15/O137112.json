The barb of the handle complements the forward thrust of the tip of the blade, creating an impression of live and sinuous tension.  The elemental power is undisturbed by ornament.  Even the piercing is simple and functional, the crosses and line reinforcing the dynamic V shape of for and aft.  This is silver at its most simple and sculptural.  Its power lies in the harmony of scale, shape and form.",
