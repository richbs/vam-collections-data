However, the use of stretchers, which interrupt the curved outline of the legs, suggests that it was perhaps not made in Paris. \n\nThe 18th-century needlework on the seat and back was evidently designed to cover a chair, for it follows the convention that human figures should be represented only on the chair-back, while animals or birds could be shown on the seat. The back shows the New Testament scene of Christ meeting the woman of Samaria. However, these covers were clearly made for a larger chair, and have been cut down to fit this one, probably in the late 19th century. The chair also has a confection of old pieces of webbing under the seat, perhaps added at the same time to lend an appearance of antiquity to the upholstery.",

Clifford Smith to Mr Strange, 14/7/1914\nThis Louis XIV walnut arm chair is, as far as its woodwork is concerned, a well-designed and decorated example of a type at present unrepresented in the collection. The framework, apart from its fine needlework cover, is of interest as showing the influence of Continental work on contemporary English furniture.\n\nP. S. Trendell, 14/7/1914\nThe needlework panels on this chair represent (on the back) Christ and the woman of Samaria at the well, and (on the seat) a rococo compartment containing flowering trees, and birds. They are choice examples of 'petit point' - possibly English work, dating from the early part of the 18th century. The condition is particularly good of the back panel, the seat is more worn; there are only slight signs of restoration. I estimate the value of the two panels between \u00a335 and \u00a340. [Marginal note: 'Back - \u00a320-\u00a325 / Seat - abt. \u00a315.'] This kind of needlework designed for upholstery is much sought after by students and the prices are rapidly increasing. \n\nE. F. Strange to Director, n.d. [14/07/1914]\nI recommend the purchase of this chair, which you have seen, at \u00a365. The sum available for this Dept. is \u00a3365.\nThe chair fills a gap in the collection &, judging from frequent enquiries for work of this kind, will be of considerable practicable value to students.  The explanation of its \u2018English\u2019 suggestion is doubtless due to the fact that so many French makers of needlework settled in this country after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes & established their own style here. This makes the chair all the more valuable s indicating the sources of a style afterwards associated with this country.\n\nPurchase for \u00a365:0:0 sanctioned, Cecil Smith, 14.vii.14.",
