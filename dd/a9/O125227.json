Everett Millais provided eighteen drawings to illustrate The Moxon Tennyson (1857), one of the most lavishly decorated Pre-Raphaelites poetry books; another drawing by Millais in the V&A collection (D.219-1903) belongs to the same group. The present sheet was engraved for the book by the Dalziel Brothers, a successful London-based printmaking firm. Millais has here depicted Queen Eleanor, who was believed to have saved the life of her husband Edward I by sucking the poison out his wounded arm, during a crusade, at Acre in 1271.\nPoetry books of the time were initially printed without illustrations, and only those that were considered profitable were printed in luxuriously embellished editions. Interestingly, the death in 1858 of the publisher of the Tennyson volume, Edward Moxon who died at the age of 57, was attributed by some to the anxiety caused by the cost of this enterprise.",
