Intended for display, this piece must have been an important commission for the potters at the time. Sumptuary laws of 1601 had prohibited the manufacture of gold and silver tablewares, with the result that even the most splendid tablewares were made in other materials, usually ceramic. This gave a great boost to both the potters of Talavera and the Spanish ceramic industry in general.\n\nTalavera, in Toledo, became the leading centre of ceramic production in seventeenth-century Spain, renowned for its tin-glazed wares painted in a Baroque style with warm rich colours. Subjects favoured include armorials and hunting scenes (often after the prints of Johannes Stradanus), and the freedom of design and sketchy brushwork of Talavera's painters endow their wares with a uniquely dynamic and lively quality.",
