Arched back of two pieces of sycamore with a seal impression of a bearded classical head in red was at the bottom end. The sides have been deepened by thickening strips above and below, contributing about 2.5 mm to the present depth. Peg-box with open back and with stamped decoration in the French manner, which includes a fleur-de-lys. A well-carved blind-folded female head. The ebony tailpiece, probably modern, is attached to an end pin with ivory backing plate. The ebony fingerboard is raised on a long packing wedge. Seven gut strings and seven wire sympathetic strings, the latter running from the higher pegs outside the back of the pegbox over two nuts and thence into the hollowed neck'.
