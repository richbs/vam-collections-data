In India the practice of carrying these all on a single belt, usually around the waist, persisted well into the 19th century. Typically the equipment carried included two flasks containing different grades of gunpowder, a coarse grade for the main charge and a finer grade to use in the firing pan. As well as pouches for bullets, wadding, spare matchcord etc., sometimes prepared cartridges were carried, as well as an ignition source such as tinder and a flint or firesteel such as this.",
