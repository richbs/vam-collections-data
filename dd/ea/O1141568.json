If the cushions retain their original covers then presumably the armchair was supplied for The Grove, Harborne, some years after the house was rebulit 1877-8 for the industrialist and collector, William Kenrick, M.P.\n\nIt is also not clear for which room the armchair was originally supplied. The 1911 Inventory of The Grove (Birmingham City Archives, MS 400/93; two copies in Buildings file, Information Section, Department of Furniture, Textiles and Fashion) lists in the Smoking Room, on the first floor, a 'Moveable reclining rail pattern chair with cushions; covered green tapestry', valued at \u00a39 10s. A photograph of the Library, on the ground floor, c. 1930, shows part of the arm and front leg of the armchair beside the fireplace (Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, Neg. No. S.6889)",
