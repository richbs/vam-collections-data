These were designed to be pasted up complete or to be cut out and pasted up as separate vignettes (the sheets have been pre-cut around the outlines of the motifs for this purpose). The style is very simple, and reminiscent of the nursery wallpaper friezes of the period. The Journal of Decorative Art for May 1933 described this decoration as follows: \"...Made up of four large motifs on a continuous base. It shows the park in Georgian times, when Park Lane and Hyde Park Corner had a different look. Appropriately too, the treatment is suggestive of an old print. The colour is kept flat and low in tone. It will inevitably be a big success, for it is definitely decorative as well as novel.\"",
