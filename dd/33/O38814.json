The front shows the exterior of a school for toys, with a small teddy bear rushing toward the front door, where his teacher, a doll in a pink dress, stands; the wording, some of  which is printed on the cut-out door, reads:\nYOU ARE 3 TODAY \nHAPPY BIRTHDAY !\nwith the figure 3 printed in gold.  The door opens to reveal part of the classroom, with pop-up figures of Noddy and a golliwog sharing a desk. More toy characters are visible when the card is opened, and the verse reads:\nNoddy says he's bringing\nA happy day for you,\nA little song he's singing,\nMay all you wish come true !",
