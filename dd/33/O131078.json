The form of this cabinet on stand, and the arrangement of its internal drawers, were probably inspired by veneered cabinets lavishly decorated with marquetry or lacquer. This is a relatively plain piece, however, with both structure and applied geometrical mouldings in oak, and a single ornamentel star of bone inlay on the front of the door.\n\nOn loan to the Elizabethan House, Plymouth.",
