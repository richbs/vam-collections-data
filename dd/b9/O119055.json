On the front the arms of Boteler are engraved within a cartouche. Around the sides of the drum is engraved \u2018DO NOT FOR TO REPENT\u2019, urging the wearer not to sin, lest he repent of the deed later.\n\nThe arms are close to those granted in 1470 to Richard Boteler of Sandwich, Kent, which,  without the colours, may be simplified as a covered cup, between three talbot heads (a dog of bloodhound type), erased, on a field which is \u2018gyronny of six\u2019, i.e. it is composed of six triangular pieces of cloth. These arms were confirmed to Henry Boteler who moved from Sandwich and rebuilt the mansion of Heronden in the parish of Eastry in Kent, where this ring was later found. He died in 1580. His son, Richard received a grant of distinctively different arms in 1589. Although the arms on the ring have four talbot heads rather than three, it seems likely that the ring was made either for Henry, or for Richard prior to 1589 . In 1800 it was recorded that a gold seal ring \u2018weighing nineteen pennyweights [29.5 grams], with this motto, Do not, for to repent\u2019 and the arms of Boteler granted in 1470 had been found \u2018a few years since\u2019 in Eastry and was in the possession of William Boteler. In 1870, the memory was that the ring had been \u2018stuck on the tooth of a harrow\u2019.",
