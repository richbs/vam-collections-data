These were usually presented as paper stacks in exhibitions and visitors to the exhibition were invited to help themselves to the prints. Many of these multiples used text rather than images.\n\nThis print is a collaborative piece with Christopher Wool, another American artist who has used text extensively in his paintings and prints. It was made as part of their collaboration for the Printed Matter bookshop at Dia, New York, in 1993. When exhibited, the specified ideal height for the stack of these prints is 8 inches. The text is a quotation from the Russian writer and philosopher Vasilii Rozanov and is a definition of nihilism. This quotation was used by Wool in a number of his drawings and paintings.",
