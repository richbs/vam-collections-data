This startling portrait accentuates Hensler-Moring's fashioned fringe and the neoclassical drapery that form her sleeves, typifying a modern woman of the Weimar Republic. \n\nThis portrait was acquired by the V&A as part of the Kineton Parkes Bequest of 1938. Kineton Parkes (1865\u20131938) was a writer, lecturer and principal of the Nicholson Institution, Leek, who had a passion for sculpture. Annie Hensler-Moring was probably included in Parkes' archive as she would have been part of a close artistic circle, perhaps discovered during Parkes' research into sculptors, and possibly an artist  herself.",
