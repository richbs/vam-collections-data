            "history_note": "The doorway was purchased in 1879, at the same time as the very similar Doria family chapel doorway (221-1879). It originally formed the entrance to the Spinola family chapel in the church of San Bartolomeo della Certosa in Rivarolo on the outskirts of Genoa. It  was commissioned by Giorgio Spinola in 1480, as noted in the inscription in the frieze under the lunette. \nThe Certosa was suppressed in 1798 and the chapel became part of the Scassi family property. After the chapel collapsed in 1859 its sculptures were sent to the Villa Scassi in Sampierdarena. The doorway was purchased from Alfred Pratt of London for \u00a375.\n\nHistorical significance: The doorway is all that remains of the Spinola family chapel at the church of San Bartolomeo della Certosa in Genoa. It is also one of few carved slate doorways to be found outside of Genoa, and one of the few examples with a lunette above the lintel. Most of the surviving fifteenth-century carved doorways on entrances to private homes in Genoa have rectangular areas above the  lintels, often combined with a rectangular vertical insertion containing the monogram of Christ. Though the attribution remains unclear, it provides an example of the development of sculpture in fifteenth-century Genoa under the influence of Lombard sculptors.",

            "historical_context_note": "Decorated door jambs and lintels were a common feature of Genoese architecture. As noted by R. Lightbown, their development was a result of the \u201c\u2026topography of the old city\u201d in which tall houses were built on steep streets, thus leaving the doorway as the most visible area for display of wealth or family identification. (Lightbown, p.412).\nRectangular carved lintels surmounted the doorways of palazzi, while the arched lunette of the V&A doorway has been seen as an appropriate form for its original religious location. (Profumo, 164).\n\nThe use of slate was typical in Genoa. It has high degrees of tensile strength and of water and fire resistance. These qualities, and its natural abundance in Liguria (the region of Genoa) made the city\u2019s preferred material for roof tiles, chimneys, doorways and floors. \n\nThe attribution of this doorway has been the subject of much debate. There is no documentation regarding the commission beyond the inscription on the lintel. There is also some confusion resulting from interpretations of documents from Genoa in the 1460s. Kruft, based on Cervetto, suggested  that there were two men named Giovanni Gaggini, (alternatively spelled \u201cGagini\u201d) originally a Lombard family, working in Genoa during the same time. This was based on documents transcribed by Cervetto which seemingly referred to two sculptors, one named Giovanni Gaggini d\u2019Andrea da Campione, who had a workshop in Genoa, and one called Giovanni Gaggini the son of Magister Beltrame, who came from Bissone. (Cervetto, 137 and Kruft, 15) Bissone and Campione (today Campione d\u2019Italia) are two towns very close to each other on the shore of Lake Lugano (in today\u2019s Switzerland). Until the 15th century, Bissone was under the rule of the Dukes of Milan, while Campione has remained Italian.\n\nAlgeri suggested in 1977 that further research might reveal that Giovanni Gaggini da Campione and Giovanni Gaggini da Bissone were the same person, as a 1475 document published by both Alizeri and Cervetto made reference to a Giovanni da Beltrame from Campione who worked with Michele d\u2019Aria for the Spinola family. She also noted that documents published by Cervetto regarding the location of the Gaggini shops locate them in the same area  of Genoa and might provide further evidence for believing they are the same person. However, it does not appear that any further research on this branch of the Gaggini family has been done, and therefore identification remains speculative. \n\nLightbown remarked that the dates suggested the work of Giovanni and Elia Gaggini but the style of the doorways did not.  He therefore attributed the doorways to Michele d\u2019Aria, who worked with the Gaggini workshop and was documented in Genoa in the 1460s. (Lightbown, 413).",
