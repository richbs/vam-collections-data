Caroline Reboux began her career as a penniless but talented young milliner. Her work was discovered and promoted by the fashionable Princess Metternich and in turn attracted the custom of the Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III. In later years the House of Reboux was run by the milliner Lucienne Rebate.\n\nReboux was known for her clean, simple style using fabrics such as satin, velvet and felt which were draped or cut with a minimum of added or fussy details. Feathers were a favourite embellishment. In the 1920s Reboux was highly regarded for her cloche style hats, which were often cut and formed on the client's head.\n\nThis woven label is cut in a circular shape in order to be inserted inside the crown of a hat, where it would form part of the lining. This was a practical method of labelling hats which ensured the labels would not catch or snag the wearer's hair.",
