Not only has the print been identified as a combination of two published prints by Thomas Daniell (1749-1840) and his nephew William (1769-1837), both of whom had travelled extensively in India, the recording by collectors of an identical piece marked 'Hamilton Stoke' has enabled it to be attributed to a very obscure maker.",
