It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years.  Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nThe son of the music hall artist of the same name, Fred Emney junior made his first stage appearance as a page boy in Romance with Doris Keane, at the Duke of York's Theatre in 1915.  He developed a comedy-at-the-piano routine and went on to appear as a comic character in pantomime, comedies and musicals, becoming so successful as Lord Leatherhead in the 1934 London Hippodrome production of Mr Whittington that Jack Buchanan reduced the size of his part. In 1954 he had his own television show Emney Enterprises and became famous above all for his overweight, monocle-wearing 'silly ass' character.  He played his last major role aged seventy, as the photographer in When We Are Married at the Strand Theatre.",
