The plant is finely painted with delicate veining in tones of green for the leaves and stems and hues of red,orange and pink for the flowers with touches of blue at the base of the anthers.\n      The painting is framed with a gold line with an inner ruling in red and a narrow inner border of strips of plain faded orange paper with a double ruling in black ink at its outer margin and a single one on the inner.  The painted is mounted on a plain ivory-coloured paper border with grey strips of paper, outlined in black at its outer margins.  A woven beige textile margin has been added on its inner side as a gutter for the binding.",
