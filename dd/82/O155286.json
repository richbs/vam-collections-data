The Museum Number is in the bottom left hand corner. The edges have been turned under and stitched in place. If you run your fingers across this piece it feels like it has a seam down either side, with these two added sections extending the width, although the pattern and the colours are consistent.\nThere is a border along the bottom [band A] with an upward right pointing pale blossom alternating with a downward right pointing pink blossom.  There are diagonal green leaves. There is a narrow edging of pink, light blue and yellow.  A narrow band is above, below and to the sides extending part way up the sides of the panel.  It has small pairs of green leaves with pink or white flowers [band B].  A section of band A on a larger scale forms an outer border part way up either side.  Band B creates a small square in the lower corners.\n\nThe main pattern is a series of brown diagonal lines from lower right to upper left.  These also edge the various sections in the borders.\nThere are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: white ground with a diagonal striped stem and bunch of pale flowers alternating with a striped stem pointing straight down with a pink blossom bending to the lower right.\n[2] wider stripes in two designs: [a] white and pink vase edged with light blue with a large pink carnation with green and pink striped edges and a pair of leaves edged with dark green edged at the base alternating with a larger yellow and pink vase outlined with light blue with a central spray of 3 white flowers and other small flowers.\n[b] a wider stripe with branching stems with a pale rosette outlined in pink and 2 pink rosettes outlined in green alternating with a large bunch of round white blossoms.\n\nThreads: silk; 2S; red, pink, light green, green, dark green, orange, beige, brown, white, light grey, light blue, blue, yellow, dark orange.",
