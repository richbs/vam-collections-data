            "history_note": "Rules:\n\"Until the introduction of Happy Families rules, there were several different sets of rules, but most were games of forfeiture.\nBy far the simplest set of rules required all the cards to be dealt and one player to be chosen as leader or president.  He asks each player in turn a question; a correct answer is rewarded with a counter from the kitty, a wrong answer means the player must pay into the kitty.  The questions test the general knowledge of the players, for example, the geography questions want to know in what country or county a particular town, river, or hill is, or what the principal product of a town is.  On the whole, the cards are numbered on both sides and a game can be played in number rotation until one of the players has no cards left and wins.  In this game, when a player gives a wrong answer, the next player to play begins with his or her lowest numbered card.\nThe majority of games played with these rules deal with historical or geographical subjects, but languages and grammar were also sometimes introduced.\"   - CGGoodfellow, 1991\n\"...A footnote to the rules reads: 'by which means the cards will render not only instructive but amusing and entertaining,'  This set shows the move from an agricultural to an industrial society and it was published at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.  The list of manufacturers combined with the descriptions of the countryside must have been a revelation to many\" - CGGoodfellow, 1991",
