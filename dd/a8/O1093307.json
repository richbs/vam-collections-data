London: The Victoria and Albert Museum in association with Hurtwood Press, 1983.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n<i>\nPaul Martin   British   1864-1942\nAn album of Hampstead scenes   1898\nPrinting-out paper, gold-toned\nImage size 86 X 84 mm   Mus. nos. 1839 / 40- 1980   Purchase</i>\n\nThese prints are on Solio printing-out paper, the brand supplied by Eastman Photographic Materials Company in London.  They were made from roll film negatives exposed in the NO 2 Falcon camera.  They were made in the summer of 1898 at the request of George Davison, then assistant manager of the Eastman company in London, who wished Paul Martin to try out new models of the Kodak roll film cameras.  Martin used the NO 2 Falcon box camera and the NO 5 Cartridge Kodak folding camera to photograph street scenes and August Bank Holiday on Hampstead Heath.  He found the cameras less easily concealed than his favourite 'Facile' Hand Camera and soon went back to it.  The fastest shutter speed of the 'Facile' was 1/20th of a second.\nPaul Martin is a representative figure in two ways.  He trained as a wood-engraver in the London firm of Paul Douet from 1880-86, when the half-tone process was already beginning to emerge as the new method of mass illustration.  In London wood-engraving firms between 1884 and 1899 dropped from 162 to 80 while process-engraving firms grew from 6 to 56.  Magazines became a significant market for photographers.  Martin established his own photographic illustration firm with H.G. Dorrett in 1899.  Looking back in 1939 he recalled:\n'Few wood-engravers realised what photography was going to bring in its train.  I knew that monster when he was only a sprat, for I took up photography as an amateur in 1884....When the monster made a lunge at me I dodged him and clung to his tail and am still hanging on'.  \n\nMartin is also an early master of the snapshot, especially of the 'candid' - or covert - variety.  'Instantaneous' photography was a major project of the 1850s.  The effort to record life 'on the wing' led to the first application of the shooting term snap-shot to photography by John Herschel in 1860:\n'What I have to propose may appear a dream; but it has at least the merit of being a...realisable one...It is the...representation of scenes in action - the vivid and lifelike reproduction and handling down to the latest posterity of any transaction in real life...I take for granted nothing more than...what photography has already realised, or...will realise within some very limited lapse of time...the possibility of taking a photograph, as it were, a snap-shot - of securing a picture in a tenth of a second of time.'\n\nThis projection was fulfilled by Paul Martin and others one generation later.\"",
