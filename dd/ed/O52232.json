            "history_note": "James Irvine is a designer of furniture and industrial products, who has worked in Tokyo and Milan since 1984, latterly as a partner of Sottsass Associati. He also designs for his own consultancy with international clients. His designs are manufactured in Britain (SCP), Germany (Vitra, Interlubke and others), Sweden (CBI) and Italy (Cappellini, Magis and others).\n\nConversation between Christian Springfeldt of Klara/cbi and Rebecca Milner, Curatorial Assistant, FWK dept, 4/5/01 -  sofabed is still in production and available in 73 different colours although black most popular - 90% of those sold are upholstered in black fabric.  Approx 75-100 sofas are made to order per year.  Skandium in Wigmore Street are the UK agents for this sofa.\n\nHistorical significance: The simplicity of design and construction, and the almost naive form of the sofabed are characteristic of furniture by CBI, and more generally, of a minimalist sensibility in recent European design. Perhaps as a backlash against the perceived excesses of the 1980s design, and with a new consciousness of the importance of environmental design, many designers and manufacturers have made a virtue of not 'over designing' their products. Inventive and characterful as they are, products by CBI have a common quality of simplicity and purity, based on the philosophy of CBI which is \"humanism, respect for natural materials, comfort, function, availability and the user in focus\" (CBI catalogue, 1997). The manufacturer purports to make quality products for long periods of use, to counter the race of consumption and disposal which characterises industrial design, but which is no longer economically or environmentally sustainable. Furthermore, CBI claims a basis for their rational designs and choices of materials in traditional Nordic culture and design.",
