He wrote: 'The Buspa Valley is celebrated for its beauty and its shooting grounds; my interest lay only in the former, and the part about Sungla was certainly very fine. Groves of walnut trees clustered thick on each bank of the Buspa, which meandered peacefully through the valley: above these, far up the hillsides, flourished the pine and the sturdy deodar \u2013 the whole shut in by lofty mountains, which on the north side often terminated in sharp-pointed peaks, while those on the south were generally covered with verdure and forest. There was a delightful freshness and beauty about the whole, after the barren and wild scenes through which I had lately passed. I spent three very pleasant days taking views about the valley, and left Sungla with reluctance.\u2019",
