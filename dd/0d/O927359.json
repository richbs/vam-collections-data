They attempt to bribe him to influence his choice. He chooses Venus for her prize, the love of the most beautiful woman in the world, Helen of Greece. According to legend this story started the Trojan War. \n\nWith the electoral and ducal arms of Elector Frederick of Saxony and the emblem of Lucas Cranach, all hanging from a tree.",

            "public_access_description": "In this print Lucas Cranach placed a mythological scene in a real landscape, recognisable as the river Elbe and the Schrammstein cliffs. \n\nThe subject is the Judgment of Paris. Paris, son of King Triam of Troy, is selected to choose which of the goddess Minerva, Venus and Juno, is the fairest. They appear before Paris while he sleeps and attempt to bribe him to influence his choice. He chooses Venus for her prize, the love of the most beautiful woman in the world, Helen of Greece. According to legend this story started the Trojan War. Cranach was one of the first to depict the subject in large artworks, though it was known in book illustration. He returned to it often, making around a dozen paintings as well as two prints. \n\nCranach was court artist in Wittenberg to Elector Frederick III of Saxony, whose ducal and electoral arms appear here. He may have got the subject through his connections with Wittenberg's new humanist university. The subject was used in a lecture to students in 1503 as an allegory of the choice between a contemplative (Minerva), active (Juno) or voluptuous (Venus) life. It was also found in manuscripts illustrating alchemy, where it represented the three final stages of making the philosopher's stone. \n\nThe subject would also honour his patron, who claimed to trace his lineage back to the Trojans. Frederick III would have seen a live tableau of the subject, described in Jean Molinet's chronicle, when he attended Philip the Fair's crowning as regent in 1494. The subject was often performed as an allegory or marriage or the importance of choosing virtue over pleasure.",
