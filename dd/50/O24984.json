She faces to the front, in a dancing pose, the legs wide apart and bent at the knees, the left arm raised with thumb and forefinger making a mudra, the right arm pendant. She wears an accordian-pleated skirt, with double  wiast scarf hanging from the waist-band.   Her torso is nude, but ornamented with rich jewellery, and from beneath the arm-pits swing upward the ends of the scarf. Her jewelled hair is done in a large chignon on the right side of her head. The raised frame has a band of diamond-diaper, between two rows of bead-device.",

Although founded in the 14th century this structure probably dates from the 18th century .  The pillared drummer's hall (Hewisi Mandapaya) has decorative panels carved with a variety of subjects, each framed in a diamond-daiper band identical to that seen in this ivory example.",
