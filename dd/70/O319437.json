Around this rectangle is a border of tulips in cartouches. At either end is a further border of arched compartments containing carnations. The pattern is in red velvet pile with bands of green velvet at each side and gold brocade on white satin. The main weft is of cotton.\n\nA vertical and horizontal point repeat with four minimum pattern areas. Satin foundation structure: 4/1 satin, warp: S spun ivory silk. Weft: cotton. Satin and velvet warp order 3-1-2. Velvet structure: red and green silk, pile counts, warps 10, along weft 10. Binding weft threads: super skinny, white or light ivory. Brocade structure: part brocaded; 4/1 twill, count 21. Shots between pile 2, silver (?) metal twist. Metal almost entirely picked out. Some of the brocade wefts are two-ply silk; some are one ply-silk. The metal foil is thinner. This is possibly a triple-cloth of some sort. Some areas which seem to be meant to be brocaded, the second set of satin warps was pulled to the surface. These are yellow opposed to ivory. In several places, the ivory satin warps are the face of the fabric, and in some places, the yellow satin warps are. Possibly painted yellow.",
