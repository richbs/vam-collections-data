Many families would also have played charades or sometimes put on plays.  A dressing up box and raiding of the family attics would have provided most of the costumes.  Any self-respecting 'dressing up' box would have had plenty of standard costume parts and accessories, especially cloaks and tights, which would be needed for many period or fantasy costumes.   \n\nOliver Messel (1904-1978) was Britain's leading theatre designer from the early 1930s to the mid 1950s, working in every aspect of entertainment - ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue - as well as in interior decoration and textile design.  His lavish, painterly and romantic designs informed by period styles, were perfectly in tune with his times and earned him an international reputation.  By 1960, however, Messel's style had become unfashionable, having no sympathy with the new 'kitchen sink' school of theatre.  He increasingly concentrated on his non-theatrical painting and designing and eventually retired to the Caribbean, where he began a new career designing and building highly idiosyncratic luxury villas.",
