            "public_access_description": "For the first half of the 1920s, framed handbags remained popular, deep and curved, with a full, gathered fabric pouch, often heavily beaded or, for the day, in plain taffeta.  Straight frames with a chain handle were popular, and complemented geometric patterns in leather patchwork or embroidery.  The discovery in 1922 of King Tutankhamun's tomb in Egypt inspired a wealth of Egyptomania in the applied arts, from fabrics to jewellery and make-up, although these preoccupations pre-dated Carter's discovery.  This green felt handbag has applied bands of black and gold leather and an applique design of birds in an Egyptian style. The bag is lined with yellow satin and has two pockets, mirror and powder wallet.",

Broughton died before he could be elevated to a peerage, their eldest son Urban H.R. Broughton (1896-1966) became 1st Baron Fairhaven of Lode on 20 March 1929, while Cara became 1st Lady Fairhaven. This barony became extinct on Urban H.R.Broughton's death, but a later barony, Baron Fairhaven of Anglesey Abbey, co. Cambridge, was granted to him in 1961, with a remainder to his brother, Henry (1900-1973), to enable this title to continue after his death without male heirs.\n\nThis forms part of a large donation of late 19th and early 20th century garments and accessories (with a few historical textiles) donated to the Museum in 1972 by Cara's grandson and Henry's son, Major Ailwyn Broughton and his wife, a year before Ailwyn became Lord Fairhaven following his father's death.",
