The celebrated Roman actor Roscius achieved such fame that his name was used in the 18th and early 19th centuries to indicate a particularly talented player. The popular child star Master William Betty (1791-1874), who was acting at the same time as Miss Sugg, was billed as The Young Roscius. Billington, to whom Miss Sugg is also being compared, was the actress and singer Elizabeth Billington (1765 or 1768 - 1818). Miss Sugg did have the advantage of a good publicist. The print was published by her father, the ventriloquist Lee Sugg.",
