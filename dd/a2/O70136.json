Cut from a piece of tightly-woven linen, the bottom edge formed by the selvedge and the other edges turned and hemmed.\n\nThe top seven inches (17.5 cms) are embroidered with black silk in long-armed cross and double running stitches. Eight different border patterns, varying in depth from 0.5 to 2 inches (1 to 5 cms), are based on an angular 'coiling' stem with stiff fruit and flowers. The patterns are arranged in two incomplete columns. In the empty space below the left-hand column is a simple wavy line motif worked with white linen thread in double running stitch, and a motif, possibly a letter B, worked with beige silk in double running stitch.\n\nThe remaining 11.25 inches (28.5 cms) of the sampler is divided into twelve bands of drawn-thread work, varying in depth from 0.5 inch to 1.25 inches (1 to 3 cms). The narrower bands are decorated with simple needle-woven patterns. The four wider bands are divided into small squares by over-cast bars, filled with interlace stitches to form geometric patterns.",

With the composition of band samplers comes the first clear indication in England of the form being used as a method of instruction and practice for girls learning needlework.",
