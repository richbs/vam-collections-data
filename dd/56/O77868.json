It came from a small bowl that warped slightly during firing, resulting in a domed base. It may originally have been part of a whole piece that was subsequently broken. On the other hand, it may be part of a bowl that mis-fired and broke in the kiln. The simple decoration of a crab among waves indicates that it was a piece of everyday domestic ware.\n\nOwnership & Use\nThis type of non-imperial ware was used by ordinary people in China but was also exported in large quantities to Western Asia and Europe. The sherd was given by Leigh Ashton, a former Director of the V&A, who was an expert on Chinese and Islamic ceramics.",
