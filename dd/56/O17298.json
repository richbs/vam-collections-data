            "public_access_description": "Henry Fuseli [Johann Heinrich F\u00fcssli] (1741-1825), was born in Zurich and received rigorous art-historical training from his father Johann Caspar F\u00fcssli. He spent most of his life in London becoming an associate of the Royal Academy in 1788 and a Royal Academician in 1790. He specialised in history paintings on a grand scale, drawing his inspiration from the mythology, classical literature and notably Dante\u2019s Divine Comedy. He was also a prolific writer and was elected the Academy\u2019s Professor of Painting in a post he held until 1805; he was made Keeper in 1804 and re-elected Professor in 1810, and the statutes were changed to enable him to retain the Keepership as well.\n\nThe subject matter was borrowed from Walter Scott\u2019s ballad, The Fire King, published in G.M. Lewis\u2019 Tales of Wonder in 1801. It is set at the time of the Crusades, and depicts the Fire King about to give a magical sword to the hero, Count Albert. This scene of emotional intensity and the emphasis on the hero\u2019s terror as the Fire King appears in a glow of volcanic irruptions is a fine example of Fuseli\u2019s art. His wide-ranging imagination and favourite subject matters draw upon the supernatural, fairy mythology and demonic superstition.",

            "bibliography": "<u>100 Great Paintings in The Victoria & Albert Museum</u>, London: V&A, 1985, p.88\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"Henry Fuseli 1741-1825 \n<i>British School</i> \nTHE FIRE KING, c.1801-10 \nOil on canvas, 99 X 124 cm \n158-1885 \n\nFuseli's subject is taken from Sir Walter Scott's poem 'The Fire King' of 1801. A Crusader, Count Albert, has been captured by his Infidel enemies and has fallen in love with the Sultan's daughter, Zulema. To gain her hand he has to abjure Christianity, fight his former allies and pass three nights deep in a cavern 'Where burns evermore the mystical flame which the Curdmans adore'. The first two vigils are uneventful. \nHere we see Count Albert on the third, during which the Fire King appears 'borne on the blast' to give the Crusader a magical sword to use against the Christians. His coming causes volcanic eruptions which terrify Count Albert:\n \n\u2018<i>High bristled his hair, his heart flutter'd and beat, \nAnd he turned him five steps, half resolved to retreat ....\nI ween the stout heart of Count Albert was tame \nWhen he saw in his terrors the Monarch of Flame</i>\u2019 \n \nFuseli came to London from Zurich in 1764. His immediate contacts were in literary circles, though in 1768 Reynolds was sufficiently impressed with his drawings to urge him to study in Italy and become a painter. He remained eight years in Rome, during which time he sent back paintings for exhibition at the Royal Academy. His experience there of Michelangelo, of the Antique, and to some extent the Mannerist styles of Parmigianino and Rosso profoundly affected him and form the basis of his subsequent style. In his subject matter however, he is completely individual, searching diverse literary sources for dramatic and frequently supernatural events.\n\nIt is Fuseli's ideas on expression that differentiate him from his contemporaries at the Royal Academy. Although, like them, he considered the human form to be the prime expressive vehicle - landscape plays little part in his work - and although both parties agreed that classical art supplied the exemplar to which they must strive, for Fuseli the academic appreciation of Antiquity was too limited in esteeming beauty at the expense of all else. Beauty in Fuseli is subordinated to expression - without expression he says '[Beauty] fades into insipidity, and, like possession cloys'. In this he parallels the German literary movement <i>Sturm und Drang</i>(Storm and Stress), in which Shakespeare is preferred to Racine and spontaneity of emotion opposes convention and decorum. \n\nCount Albert's terror is used by Fuseli as a means of inducing sublime emotions in the spectator. As Burke had written in his <i>A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful</i>, terror is one of the most affective emotions of the sublime. Ghosts and apparitions Burke considered as stimuli that most powerfully affect the mind. In this connection Fuseli was contemptuous of Academicians who 'Whenever they venture from their lumber rooms of heraldry and drapery into the field of fancy expose themselves with conceits of impotent puerility. With the apparition of the Fire King then, Fuseli demonstrates his own ability in the invention of supernatural characters, for as William Duff had written in 1767, it is in this class that \u2018the highest efforts and the most pregnant proofs of original Genius\u2019 are to be found.\n\nChristopher Titterington\"\n<u>Vikutoria & Arub?to Bijutsukan-z? : eikoku romanshugi kaigaten = The Romantic tradition in British painting, 1800-1950 : masterpieces from the Victoria and Albert Museum / selected by Mark Evans</u> [Japan : Brain Trust], 2002. 185 p. : ill.

Romanticism started first in Western Europe as a literary and philosophical movement and only gradually involved the other arts, explicitly around 1800. Romantic artists were fascinated by nature they interpreted as a mirror of the mind. They investigated human nature and personality, the folk culture, the national and ethnic origins, the medieval era, the exotic, the remote, the mysterious and the occult. The interest in the exotic and the non-Western, illustrated in France by such a painter as Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix (1798-1863), as well as the medieval revival, witnessed in England by Horace Walpole (1717-1797), are perhaps the most identifiable parts of Romanticism. It is really in the Post-Napoleonic period that this movement gained ascendancy. Its greatest proponents were among others Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault (1791-1824) and Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 de Chateaubriant (1768-1848) in France, Joseph Mallord William Turner (1775-1851) in England, Heinrich Heine (1797-1856) and Caspar David Friedrich (1774-1840) in Germany. In the visual arts, it was largely played out by 1850, but in music it persists for another generation.",
