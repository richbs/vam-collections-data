The cloisonn\u00e9 decoration consists of \u2018fields\u2019 (cloisons) of silver wire filled with coloured enamel on a pure white enamel ground. The rims and foot-ring are of plain burnished copper. The decoration of geometric patterns with key-fret and stylised waves together with scrolling \u2018karakusa\u2019 (Chinese grass) foliage are all motifs found on Nabeshima-ware.This type of work is typical of the cloisonn\u00e9 enamels being produced in and around Nagoya in 1880-1900. \n\nIn 1871 the Nagoya Cloisonn\u00e9 Company (Nagoya Shippo Kaisha) was established at the village of Toshima, just outside Nagoya. So many cloisonn\u00e9-manufacturing companies sprang up in and around Toshima that the area became known as Shippo-mura (\u2018cloisonn\u00e9 village\u2019) or Shippo-cho (\u2018cloisonn\u00e9 town\u2019). It rapidly became Japan\u2019s main centre of cloisonn\u00e9 production. At their peak the cloisonn\u00e9 manufacturers of Toshima were producing 70 % of all Japanese cloisonn\u00e9 enamels.",
