Due to the predominance of pink, these wares were subsequently named famille rose ('pink family') by European collectors of the mid-19th century. In China, they are usually called fencai ('powdered colours'), ruancai ('soft colours') or falancai ('enamel colours').\n\nThe exact origins of this innovation are not clear, but it probably developed from technical advancements in the manufacture of enamelled metals and cloisonn\u00e9 objects at the imperial workshops of the Forbidden City in Beijing. The colours may have been invented independently by Chinese craftsmen, although European Jesuits may have contributed to this advancement.\n\nIn addition to the enamelled decoration, the design of a dragon is moulded on the well of the saucer. This type of pattern is called anhua or 'secret design' as it is only visible when the object is held to the light.",
