The villa, also known as the Villa Ludovisi, was originally laid out by Annibale Caro in 1563. The cascade and water theatre were added in 1607-1610 by Carlo Maderno and Giovanni Fontana. In 1680 the villa passed to the Conti family.\n\nChambers moved to London in 1755 and published his influential Treatise on Civil Architecture in 1759.  Chambers demonstrated the breadth of his style in buildings such as Gower (later Carrington) House and Melbourne House, London, in such country houses as Duddingston, Scotland, and in the garden architecture he designed for Wilton House, Wiltshire, and at Kew Gardens. He became head of government building in 1782, and in this capacity built Somerset House, London.",
