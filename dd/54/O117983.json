            "public_access_description": "Crosses are the most distinctive element in French traditional jewellery.  Every French woman had one.  They usually wore them on a black velvet ribbon, fastened tightly round the neck like a choker, with a slide at the front.  The ribbon passes through the bale of the cross, and is then threaded through a hole or loop at the base of the slide, and out at either side.  The ribbon is tied in a bow at the back of the neck.\n\nNormandy has the greatest variety of crosses, some so elaborate as to be almost unrecognisable.  The croix de Saint-L\u00f4, also called a croix quadrille from its lozenge shape, has a cast openwork frame decorated with five conical mounts set with rock crystals, with smaller stones set around them.  It is the earliest of the characteristic Normandy crosses to have stones.  \n\nCroix de Saint-L\u00f4 were sometimes made of gold in the 18th century, but by the mid-19th century were only made of silver.  They were usually worn with a matching circular slide.  The slide on this cross has been replaced.",
