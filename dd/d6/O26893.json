Le gagnant est celui des joueurs qui a pos\u00e9 devant lui le plus de familles compl\u00e8tes.\nLes cartes \u00e9tant distribu\u00e9es totalement entre les joueurs, chacun d'eux, \u00e0 son tour, cherche \u00e0 obtenir de ses adversaires les cartes qui lui manquent pour compl\u00e8ter une ou plusieurs familles.\nLa demande se fait carte par carte autant de fois que la carte demand\u00e9e est bien dans la main du joueur sollicit\u00e8.  Quand ce dernier n'a pas cette carte, c'est \u00e0 son tour de choisir l'adversaire \u00e0 qui il comple prendre des cartes, et ainsi de suite.\nBien entendu, celui qui a remis des cartes peut les r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer quand c'est \u00e0 son tour de faire la demande.\nPour faciliter le classement des cartes dans la main, chaque famille porte dans l'angle gauche de ses 6 cartes un petit personnage (homme ou femme) de la m\u00eame couleur dont la t\u00eate est remplac\u00e9e par une lettre F fils ou fille, P p\u00e8re, M m\u00e8re, G grand-p\u00e8re ou grand-m\u00e8re.\n\nGENERAL HAPPY FAMILIES RULES\n\nThree or more can play and special cards are normally used, each showing four members of a family, mother, father, son and daughter,  However, variations have been developed to use groups of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 to a set.  Also subject variations occur and some are educational, for example The Counties of England.\n\nThe object of the game is for each player to collect as many complete `families' as possible.  \nOne of the players deals out all the cards.  If more than one round is played, the players take it in turn to deal.  It does not matter if some players have one card more than others.\nEach player looks at his cards and sorts them into families.\nIt is important that players keep their cards hidden from each other.  With young children it is a good idea if they can lay their cards out of view of the other players.\nWhen all the players are ready, the person to the dealer's left asks any player, by name, for a particular card (eg Master Baker).  He must already possess at least one of member of the same family, ie Mrs. Baker.  If the person asked has the card, he must give it to the first player, who may again ask anybody for a card of any family as long as he already has one card belonging to that family.  \nHe continues to do this until he fails to obtain a card.  If the person asked does not have the card requested, it is his turn to ask for cards.\nWhen a player collects all the cards of the same family, he puts them into a pile face down in front of him.\nPlay continues until all the families have been completed\nThe winner is the person who collects the most families.",
