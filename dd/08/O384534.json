The surface was then gilded by the<i> doreur</i>. Mercury gilding was extremely dangerous as the burning off of the mercury from the amalgam produced noxious fumes resulting in eventual brain damage. Bronze-workers are mostly anonymous, and the maker of this pair of candelabra is not recorded.",

The taste for richly decorated furnishing bronzes was typical of the collection assembled by John Jones in the second half of the 19th century.",
