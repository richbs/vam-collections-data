Full Citation: \n \n\"<b>32 Unknown Woman</b> \n<b>1640-5</b> \nP117-1910 \n\n<b>Oval 65 x 53 mm</b> \n\nFeatures hatched finely in brown and sanguine, with grey and some blue shadow, and red in the lips, on a very pale, thick carnation ground extending under the hair; hair hatched in dark brown and black over pale brown wash; costume and accessories in wash with gouache heightening and some touches of gold; background, a landscape and sky washed and hatched in gouache; on vellum put down on pasteboard. \n\n<b>Condition:</b> Very faded; engrimed in the background and on the forehead; multiple losses in the margins, especially on the lower edge, with some retouches.  \n \n<b>Signed:</b> In black, lower right (obscured by frame): <i>IH</i>.  \n \n<b>Frame:</b> Eighteenth-century(?) chased gold rim with a central beaded fillet and a scalloped bezel holding a slightly convex glass; the tortoiseshell back held by a smooth bezel.  \n \n<b>Provenance:</b> George Salting; by him bequeathed to the Museum, 1910. Long evidently thought that the miniature had been in the Addington Collection; (1) he cites two lots from the Addington sales (2) both Signed Hoskins miniatures of unknown women and both formerly in Lord Shaftesbury's collection. Long may have based this line of thought on something in the Salting notebooks, to which he had access but which are now lost. Normally Long would have copied out anything relevant from the notebooks.  \n \n<b>Literature:</b> Foster 1914-16, vol. II, p. 150, no. 23 5; Long 1930, p. 37; Reynolds 1959, pl. vii, fig. 12; Summary Catalogue, 1981, p. 31.  \n \nThe signature is a little unconventional and may be an inaccurately restored version subsequent to damage, but the general placing of the miniature in the Hoskins orbit has never been questioned. The portrait conforms stylistically to a group of signed and dated miniatures of 1646, for example: <i>Unknown Lady</i> (3) <i>Unknown Man Aet 27</i> (4) and General Duvison' and is therefore one of those that may be by Hoskins junior. It follows closely in date on Cat. No. 29, but is much freer in adapting its Van Dyckian models. In brushwork and palette it also contrasts with Cat. Nos 26-9; and has a relatively direct and firm hatching in the features, over a thick, juicy carnation, which is still evident despite fading and retouching.\n \n1 MS notes in Museum file. \n2 Christie's 26 April 1883, lot 101, and 24 May 1886, lot 176. \n3 Formerly Messrs Ashcroft, photo V&A. \n4 Beauchamp Collection. \n5 Buccleuch Collection.\"",

Long may have based this line of thought on something in the Salting notebooks, to which he had access but which are now lost.
