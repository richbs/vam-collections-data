            "public_access_description": "The roundel is one of a series of 12 showing the Labours of the Months. Each scene is set within a circular border, coloured light and dark blue to indicate the period of light and darkness relevant to the month. Each border also each bears an inscription giving the number of daylight hours. At the top of each roundel is the sun in the appropriate House of the Zodiac. Opposite it is the crescent moon. August shows the sun in the sign of Virgo. A man guiding a plough drawn by two oxen represents the labour of the month. \n\nIt seems that the roundels were commissioned from the Florentine sculptor Luca della Robbia (1400-1482) between 1450 and 1456. They were to decorate the ceiling of Piero de\u2019 Medici\u2019s study in the Palazzo Medici in Florence. The study was destroyed when the palace was reconstructed in 1659.\n\nPiero de\u2019 Medici (died 1469) was the father of the famous Lorenzo the Magnificent. He owned an impressive library that included many classical texts. Among them was Columella\u2019s De Re Rustica (\u2018On Agriculture\u2019), which may have inspired the choice of decoration. The curvatures of the 12 roundels suggest that Piero\u2019s study was a small barrel-vaulted room about 3 metres wide and 5 metres long. The roundels were set in three rows of four. August was in the centre row along the apex of the vault.\n\nThe design of each roundel is based on contemporary agricultural practice as well as descriptions of agriculture in classical texts - one important source being Columella's De Re Rustica, a 1st century treatise that appears in Piero's inventory on 1465. The light and dark blue around the border indicate the periods of light and darkness. The hours of daylight are noted on the right. At the top of each tile is the sun in the appropriate house of the zodiac.\nRecent restoration has revealed that the tiles were not round but square. Each has ribs along the back. These add strength to the tile, and also reduce the bulk of the clay to prevent problems in firing. The curve of each panel allows us to determine where it would have been placed within the barrel-vaulted ceiling.\n\nThe study that Piero de' Medici created in the family palace in Florence was a miniature treasury, famous throughout Italy. According to the architect and sculptor Filarete, 'the floor as well as the ceiling [was] enamelled with most worthy figures, so that whoever enters is filled with admiration'. These glazed terracotta scenes, which look like drawings on blue-prepared paper, formed part of the rich ceiling decoration. Luca's use of pigments and glazes to produce these unique works was an extraordinary technical achievement.",
