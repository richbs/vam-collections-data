When they were acquired, they had been grouped along with other designs as dating from 1955-56, and so were presumed to be designs by Alan Graham who designed the last few collections for Paquin before the house closed on 1 July 1956 and had succeeded the Basque designer Lou Claverie in 1953.\n\nHowever, one of the suits, \"Enfant G\u00e2t\u00e9' (E.22834-1957) was photographed for issue 2744 of <i>L'Art et la Mode</i>, Spring 1951, where it appears on page 16. This confirms that these 27 designs were originally mis-archived under the wrong date, and that they are all actually by Lou Claverie for the Spring 1951 collection - hitherto thought to be totally absent from the Paquin archives.\n\nThe 27 designs that have been re-identified in this way are E.22818 to 22836, 22839, 22840, 22845, 22850, 22854, 22859, 22860 and 22863-1957.\n\nDaniel Milford-Cottam, July 2013.",
