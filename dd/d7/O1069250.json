He also inherited sufficient wealth and social status to pursue his true love, watercolour painting. He was a talented amateur painter in the style of Thomas Gainsborough, counting artists such as Paul Sandby among his friends, and an avid collector of watercolours by Gainsborough, Cozens, Michael Angelo Rooker and Thomas Hearne. In 1794 Monro moved to a new house on Adelphi Terrace (along the Thames), and there began welcoming young painters to his home, supplying them with painting materials, lamps and desks, furnished drawings (from his own portfolio, or borrowed ones from artist friends) for them to copy, and then paid them \"half a crown and a supper\" for their work, keeping the copies for his collection. \nThrough this informal \"academy\" went Girtin and Joseph Turner (Girtin did the drawings for Turner to colour), John Varley, John Cotman, William Hunt and Copley Fielding, among many others. By his artistic mentoring, exposure to fine art and contemporary art theories, financial support (including free medical care), sketching excursions to his country home in Fletcham, and the social contacts he fostered among fledgling artists, Monro nurtured and shaped the development of three generations of watercolour painters.",
