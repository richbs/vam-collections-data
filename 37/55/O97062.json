Originally fully stocked, the gun is now half-stocked and two silver pipes are soldered to the underside of the barrel.\nThe walnut stock is profusely inlaid with trophies of Turkish arms and with rosettes and scrolls in silver wire. The backsight was probably added abroad, perhaps in France and is of saddle shape attached to a band sliding over the barrel and stock. The remaining silver mounts bear the maker's mark of the London small-worker, Mose Brent.\nThe lock is of normal construction but is equipped with a safety-catch that locks both cock and pan cover. It is inlaid with scrollwork and signed 'D. Egg' in gold. It retains its original fire blue finish.\nThe barrel tang is inlaid with a trophy of arms in gold incorporating two shields, engraved with the English and French royal arms. These are probably decorative only.",
