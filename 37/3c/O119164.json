The embroidered design shows a central design of the Virgin and Child with the Christ Child standing on the lap of the seated Virgin. The Christ Child gives the sign of the blessing, and both figures are haloed and enclosed within a wreath of stylised curving branches and lilies. In the left and right panel sections are two kneeling angels on clouds, one on either side of the central group. The angel to the left has hands together in prayer, and the one on the right has their hands clasped to their chest.\n\nThe facial features and hands show very finely-worked silks in long and short stitches with outlines in stem stitches in brown silk. The garments are worked in appliqu\u00e9 of various fabrics. There are plain woven ribbed silk patterned silk damask, and woven cloth of gold. A brown/black tweed-effect silk fabric is used for the Virgin's throne and clouds upon which the angels kneel. Floral details and the angels' wings show couched gold cord and other areas, including garment folds, are highlighted with Japanese gold thread couched in satin stitches in silk.\n\nThe frontal is divided horizontally four inches from the top edge with a double band of woven braid which matches the vertical paning. Black twisted silk cord provides a decorative openwork heading through which a supporting rod can be threaded. When acquired a black iron rod was used.\n\nA woven silk fringe, worked in repeating blocks of green, grey and black is attached two inches above the lower edge. The dossal has a hessian backing and may have originally been lined.",

See also four carved cherubs and riddle posts (W.10A &B, 11A&B, 12A&B, and 13A&B-1988) and a gradine (W.14-1988) now in the Department of Furniture.\n\nThe design was originally attributed to Martin Travers, a baroque revival designer of the first part of the 20th century. He \u201cwas patronised by the more extreme clergy of the Anglo-Catholic party and soon became their \u2018pet\u2019 designer of church fittings and illustrator of Missals and tracks simply because his sub-Italianate style appealed to those incumbents whose leanings were to Rome than Canterbury\u201d (see Julian Littens memo of 18th May 1988). Travers also produced designs for St Magnus the Martyr, Billingsgate and St Augustine\u2019s, Queens Gate.\n\nThis was acquired at the same time as four columns, four cherubs and a 'gradine' or shelf above the altar, from St Alban's Cathedral, the Mother's Union chapel. W.11 to14-1988 The  columns and gradine were designed by W.H. R. Blacking,  a pupil of Sir Ninian Comper, and not Martin Travers as was thought at the time of the acquisition. See furniture ac RF 88/183.\n\nIt is possible, because the background silk was made by them, that the dossal was embroidered by Watts & Co. Their records for this period no longer exist so they were not able to check this, although they do believe that Travers embroideries tended to be worked in convents.",
