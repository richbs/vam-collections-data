            "public_access_description": "One of the most beautiful and the most popular posters of the \u2018Velvet Revolution\u2019 was created between the 7th and 12th of December 1989 by the graphic designer and artist Michal Cihl\u00e1r. The poster supports the Civic Forum movement which led opposition to communist rule in Czechoslovakia. Cihl\u00e1r created the image using the \u2018reduction\u2019 linocut technique \u2013 slowly cutting away each section that will print a different colour from a single piece of linoleum \u201cWhen the design was finished, there was almost no linoleum at all\u201d he said. His linocut titled, \u2018Betlem\u2019 was originally hand-printed in an edition of three at Michal Cihlar\u2019s home studio in Bu\u0161tehrad. The artist still owns two of the prints, but the third was lost in the Prague - Karl\u00edn printing office and has never been found.\n\nThe motif and the title for \u2018Betlem\u2019 were proposed to Cihl\u00e1r by the sociologist Bohuslav Bla\u017eek. The original title, \u2018Merry Christmas With the Civic Forum\u2019, had to be changed for political reasons to \u2018A Peaceful Christmas with the Civic Forum\u2019. In the book titled \u2018Plak\u00e1ty sametov\u00e9 revoluce\u2019 (Posters of the Velvet Revolution, Prague 2009) by graphic designer Filip Bla\u017eek, Michal Cihl\u00e1r recalls \u201cI saw my poster hanging all over Prague and I mainly remember that it was pasted everywhere on the way to Prague Castle, when the crowds went there to celebrate the election of V\u00e1clav Havel as President\u201d.  At that time, hand-making revolutionary posters, jangling keys and distributing leaflets were all part of the same euphoric activity. Time was not separated into work and revolution\u201d. \n\nThe design was mass printed by lithography in two sizes. This is an example of the larger A1 size. The smaller version measured 32 by 43 cm. \n\nIn the middle of the snow-covered landscape, full of colourful Christmas bustle, we can see the holy family (the Virgin Mary, the Christ Child in the crib and St. Joseph). They are surrounded by people enjoying jolly activities: carrying Christmas carps and pines, playing music, hurrying to give Christmas presents or offerings apples. However, among them, there are also Czechoslovak citizens carrying national flags, a young boy with hand written democracy banner and people wearing badges with the  Civic Forum \u2018OF\u2019 logo inside a heart shape \u2013 a symbol of V\u00e1clav Havel\u2019s  presidential slogan \u2018Truth and Love Must Win Over the Lies and Hate!\u2019\n\n\nDesigned, printed and published in former Czechoslovakia",
