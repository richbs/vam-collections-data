The following is the full text of the entry: GANDOLFI, GAETANO (1734-1802) 1014 Odysseus receiving a bag of winds from Aeolus On the back a rough draft of a letter dated 12 November 1766 Pen and ink and wash; within an oval border 10 x 7 3/8 (254 x 187) D.2153A-1885 PROVENANCE Bought 1885 The unsigned draft of a letter on the back states that the writer had called upon <i>Vostra Eccellenza</i> in Bologna, but not finding him there was writing to inform him that the picture representing <i>la Venuta dello spirito santo sopra degli Apostoli</i> was ready and could be transported to its destination within two weeks. He asks that the money owing to him for the commission should be paid to him through \u2018Quel Signor di Rimino\u2019. The drawing, at one time ascribed to Giovanni Liss, was attributed to Gandolfi by Dr. Oberhuber. The style is certainly very like his, and so is the hand-writing (compare the specimen of his handwriting in the Biblioteca Comunale in the Archiginnasio at Bologna: MS B 95 entitled <i>Gaetano Gandolfi. Notizie delle opera scritte di sua propria mano</i>). As Mr Pouncey has pointed out, the composition is inspired by Tibaldi\u2019s painting of the same theme on a ceiling in the Palazzo Poggi, Bologna. There appears to be no documentary record of a picture of the Pentecost by Gaetano (or Ubaldo) Gandolfi. It is not in the fragmentary MS just quoted, but might possibly be found in one of the Oretti MSS in the same library, though Signore Bianchi in her book on the Gandolfi brothers used these sources to compile her list of lost works. It is a question whether \u2018Quel Signor di Rimino\u2019 who was to pay the artist his fee is thus referred to by his surname or whether he was a gentleman of Rimini. In the latter case, the picture was presumably painted (in 1766) for a church at Rimini.",
