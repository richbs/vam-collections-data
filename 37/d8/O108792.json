Shakespeare is buried in Stratford upon Avon and although some time after his death there were suggestions that his remains should be moved from Stratford to Westminster Abbey, the idea was abandoned and the monument was built. The carved heads on the pedestal of the statue are of Queen Elizabeth I, Henry V and Richard III, and Shakespeare is shown pointing to a scroll inscribed with Prospero's Act IV lines from The Tempest:\nThe Cloud capt Tow\u2019rs, The Gorgeous Palaces,  The Solemn Temples, \nThe Great Globe itself,  Yea all which it Inherit,  Shall Dissolve; \nAnd like the baseless Fabrick of a Vision,  Leave not a wrack behind.  \nThe speech is perhaps better known with the words that begin the passage : 'Our revels now are ended'.  On the original monument the words are in Latin.\n\nThe Derby factory produced three versions of this figure in the late 1750s to mid-1760s, often sold as a pair with one of John Milton. There was a glazed version on a rectangular base, and one in biscuit porcelain.  Its direct source was probably a reduced-sized plaster of the sculpture sold in London by John Cheere.",
