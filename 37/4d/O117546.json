I would not buy a material that creases; or an accessory which did not match; or a colour which did not suit me.  This means that when I begin to dress I can\u2019t go wrong'.\n\nThis dress, by Christian Dior (1905-57), was originally designed in plain white silk.  Mrs Newton Sharp ordered it in this expensive floral print to suit her colouring.  The outfit was completed with a top-coat of plain pink silk satin.",

What differentiated couture prints from cheaper products once dyestuffs were readily available was often the number of colours used or the quality of the base fabric on which the colours were printed.  Silk, cotton and rayon were the usual base fabrics for printing\u2026  The glorious floral concoctions of chin\u00e9 roses made for the couture houses by Ascher, Ducharne and Staron, amongst others, epitomize this strain, and remained popular with couturiers till the end of the decade (pl.5.14 and see pl.2.15).",

The dress was French Dior, although it is reported in the <i>News Chronicle</i> as London Dior for publicity reasons, as the donor, Mrs. Laurie Newton Sharp was the News Editor for <i>Harrods</i>and on a trip to America to publicise the store. She was the first person to hold the position of News Editor, which was created in 1953 to supervise the store's press and public relationships. \n\nThe label was cut out as the donor wanted to present it as a London Dior.\n\nThe dress was worn with a pink organza coat, not given, but described as simple and full. Dior commended Mrs Newton Sharp's appearance in the dress. His original design for the dress was in plain white silk.",
