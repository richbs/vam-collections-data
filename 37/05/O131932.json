The room was built in 1839 by the Rev. Francis Skurray (1774-1848), evidently as a private gallery for his distinguished collection; he is shown in the painting with his niece, Miss Kitty George.

In it were hanging pictures by artists identified on the back by an inscription by Richard Ward to whom Skurray gave it as a souvenir in 1845.\n\nHistorical significance: This painting, executed in 1839-40, provides a highly detailed record of a room in the Parsonage at Horningsham, Wiltshire. On the back of the painting is a label which describes the subject as  a 'Gothic room' and identifies the paintings as a group of Italian and Dutch old masters, including works by Guercino, Titian, Francesco Solimena, Sassoferrato and Ruisdael. The label also records that an 'ancient chest' supported  by figures representing the seasons, depicted on the right of the room, was found near Glastonbury.  \n\nThe room was built in 1839 by the Rev. Francis Skurray (1774-1848), evidently as a private gallery for his distinguished collection. Skurray is shown in the painting with his niece, Miss Kitty George. The label also records that a portrait of Skurray hung above the entrance door, not visible in this view. Skurray was best known as a poet, the author of a volume of sonnets and a metrical version of the Psalms. Little is known about the painter John Sergeant; he is probably to be identified with the artist who exhibited at the British Institution in 1824-39 and at the Royal Academy in 1828-33.\n\nIn December 1845 Skurray gave this painting to Richard Ward, presumably a friend, as a 'little Souvenir'.",
