E.N.S.A., the 'Entertainments National Service Association', was set up in 1939 to provide entertainment for the troops during World War 2. Although many of the companies and acts were of the highest calibre, it became popularly known as 'Every Night Something Awful' or 'Every Night Same Act'. The poster's frugal design was due to the limited use of materials during wartime.\n\nPresented by Lydia Kyasht, this selection of Russian ballets was one of the more meritable productions. Kyasht was a Russian-born dancer and teacher, who, after dancing as soloist with the Maryinsky Theatre, had come to London in 1908, succeeding Adeline Gen\u00e9e as prima ballerina at the Empire Theatre. She later appeared with Diaghilev's Ballets Russes and formed her own company, Ballets de la Jeunesse Anglaise in 1939. This company, also sometimes known as Kyasht's Russian Ballet, toured intermittentantly through Britain and Europe until 1946, including this peformance for E.N.S.A.",
