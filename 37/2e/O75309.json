            "public_access_description": "Benjamin Turner was one of the first, and remains one of the greatest, British amateur photographers. He began practising photography in 1849 according to the technique patented in 1841 by the British inventor W. H. Fox Talbot (1800-1877). Turner's photographs were 'contact' printed from paper negatives (known as calotypes) of the same size as the print. He printed them on albumen paper, which is paper that has been floated on an emulsion of egg white containing light-sensitive silver salts. Between 1852 and 1854 Turner compiled 60 of his own photographs, including this one, in what is believed to be a unique album, 'Photographic Views from Nature'. It might have been a sample book, a convenient method for presenting photographs for personal pleasure, and for showing to colleagues or potential exhibitors. It remained in the Turner family until it was bought by the Museum.\n\nThis photograph gives us a great deal of information about the agricultural cycle: a large corn rick, indicative of that summer's good harvest, can be seen on the left. It has been raised on staddle stones, supports that protect it from damp, rats and mice. It has been thatched to further protect it until it was to be threshed. The stack on the right is hay, a less valuable crop, intended as winter feed for the livestock. In the foreground is a felled tree trunk and branches, intended for firewood. All these traditional farming practices would change radically or disappear altogether over the next few decades.",
