They appealed particularly to collectors such as John Sheepshanks and the Reverend Chauncey Hare Townshend.\n\nPeople\nThomas Uwins (1782-1857) had worked first as a watercolourist, miniature and portrait painter, and book illustrator. After visiting France, living in Scotland and then in Italy, he returned to England. He soon specialised in oil paintings of Italian genre subjects.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nMost of his works represented happy Italian peasants but in this painting a loftier theme with a note of tragedy is introduced. The painting was exhibited in 1848 with a quotation from an Italian story.\n\n'Poor Rosa! To relieve the solitude of the villa she would have her chair taken out on the terrace where she would sit for hours listening to the music of a wandering minstrel: even this pleasure was at last denied her.  Donna Chiara the old nun in the household took it into her wise head that the minstrel was a lover in disguise.'\n\nThe theme of the suspicious old woman taking her role of tyrannical chaperone to extremes was one that many Victorian young ladies could sympathise with.",

To relieve the solitude of the villa she would have her chair taken out on the terrace, where she would sit for hours listening to the music of a wandering minstrel: even this pleasure was at last denied her. Donna Chiara the old monaca di casa took it into her wise head that the minstrel was a lover in disguise' \nThe Athenaeum critic thought it: \nOne of those Italian costumi subjects for which his long sojourn in the South has so peculiarly fitted him. The lady on the terrace, listening to the softening strains of the itinerant minstrel, is designed with much sweetness. The power of his art has affected her to so entire an absorption that she sees not the suspicion entertained by her duena, the monaca di casa, that the performer may be a lover in disguise. The story was a good one for the canvas - and worthy of a more extended scale. Mr Uwins has given the gay look of the climate; and the look-out on the Campagna, with the sparkling fountain, awakens pleasant memories to those who have lingered amid such scenes' \nThe Art Union found the subject \nReads upon the canvas not less perspicuously than in the text. The duenna-like figure amply expresses her suspicion, and this is the key to the story. Like all the works of Mr Uwins, it is full of fine and delicate feeling, and a pure appreciation of truth; the lady is beautifully painted; it is an exquisite study, to which all the accessories respond. \n'The Minstrel', described in the catalogue as 'the finished study for the picture in the Collection of J Sheepshanks, Esq', was in the artist's studio sale atChristie's3June 1858 (141). \nEXH: \tBI 1848 (20); Victorian Narrative Paintings V&A Circulation exhibition 1961 \nLIT: \tArt Union 1848, p81; Athenaeum 12 February 1848, p168 \n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
