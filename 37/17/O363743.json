            "historical_context_note": "Some of the figures portrayed here are from one of the most popular literary works of sixteenth century Europe. Calisto, passionately and obsessively in love with Melibea, is encouraged by his servants to enlist the help of Celestina, an old woman known to practice witchcraft and work as a pimp. Celestina brings the lovers together, but is murdered by Calisto's servants when she refuses to share the payment she receives for her services. They flee by jumping through a window and die in their turn. Calisto spends a passionate night with Melibea in her garden, but as he leaves her he falls from the garden wall and dies. Melibea, in despair, throws herself to her death as well.\n\tThe textual history of the work is complicated. Fernando de Rojas (born in the province of Toledo around 1473-6, died in 1541), whose name appears in acrostic form in verses prefixed to the published text, explains he is merely completing a story about two lovers which he had come across. The first edition of this hybrid work was published at Burgos in 1499, with the title Comedia de Calisto y Melibea. It was divided into 16 acts. A few years later, Rojas expanded his addition, adding 5 extra acts. He also changed the title to the Comedia o Tragicomedia de Calisto y Melibea. The earliest surviving copy of this edition dates to 1507, published at Zaragoza (it is unique, and survives incomplete). The work was immensely popular as soon as it was published, and readers soon came refer to it simply as Celestina or La Celestina, after the greedy and corrupt old woman who arranges for the lovers to meet.
