It represents the Battle of El-Teb, which took place on the 29th February 1884 in the Sudan between Britsh infantry, commanded by Sir Gerald Graham, and the Mahdist forces, led by Osman Digma. It is one of a number of representations of specific historical battles manufactured by Heinrichsen, who were one of the foremost producers of this type of lead soldiers, known as lead 'flats' because of their flat shape. They have been made by pouring molten lead into moulds, and allowing to cool before being individually hand-painted.",
