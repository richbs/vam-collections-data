            "public_access_description": "Carlo Maratti or Maratta (1625-1713) was the pupil of Andrea Sacchi in Rome in 1637 and with whom he stayed until Sacchi's death in 1661. I became the leader painter in Rome receiving commissions from the most eminent family such as the Barberini, Chigi, Spada, Rospigliosi, Pallavicini and Altieri. He executed mainly history paintings in a grandiose and decorative style but also produced a series of portraits. He may have fallen ill at the end of his life, which would explain the diminution of his output. He was buried in the church of Santa Naria degli Angeli in Rome and his funeral was attended by all the members of the Accademia and of the Comapgnia dei Virtuosi del Pantheon.\n\nThe present painting belongs most likely to the circle of the Roman painter Carla Maratta. It shows a popular mythological subject at that time: the ancient story of Apollo and Daphne. Apollo, struck by Cupid's arrow fell in love with the nymph Daphne and pursued her but she asked for help and was eventually changed into a laurel tree. The painting shows the moment when Apollo is about to reach Daphne who is simultaneously changed into a tree.",

Before 1800,</u> London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, pp. 155-6, cat. no. 188.\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\nItalian School, 17th century \n\n188 \nAPOLLO AND DAPHNE \nCanvas \n19 \u00bd x 25 3/8 (49.5 x 64.5) \nJones Bequest \n567-1882\n\nDaphne (=laurel) was the daughter of the river god Peneus (Ovid, <i>Metamorphoses</i> 1.452). Fleeing from the advances of Apollo, she prayed for help and was turned into a tree bearing her name. The composition shows the end of the pursuit: Apollo almost holds Daphne at the waist and foliage has already begun to sprout from her hands and roots from her left foot. Cupid is shooting an arrow at Apollo; on the left Peneus is seated, presumably grieving for his daughter. \nThe painting is listed by Grautoff (1914) in his catalogue of doubtful and erroneous attributions to Poussin, but it does not seem to have been ascribed to Poussin by the Museum at any time (1893 <i>Catalogue</i>, p. 190, as artist unknown). Grautoff suggested that it was possibly by Francois Verdier (1651-1730) or by Nicholas Chapron (1612-?56), but these are no longer acceptable attributions. Recently Anthony Blunt and Otto Kurz have expressed the opinion that it is Italian rather than French (written communications). Professor Kurz suggests the possibility of a Roman origin for the painting, which would account for its slight resemblance to Poussin. \nThe subject was frequently illustrated from the 15th century (W. Stechow, <i>Apollo und Daphne</i>, Studien der Bibliothek Warburg, xxiii, 1932) and the river god appears often in this context from the 16th century. Cupid shooting his arrow at Apollo - the cause of the whole story - occurs occasionally in early examples, but was not a usual part of the composition until his inclusion by Poussin (Munich, Pinakothek), after which he became a standard feature of the scene. As in most 17th century versions, this painting shows three events simultaneously: the pursuit, Apollo's embrace and the beginning of Daphne's transformation. A close parallel can be drawn, for example, with the composition of an etching of 1676 by Francois Chauveau (Stechow, fig. 59).\n\nProv. John Jones ; bequeathed to the Museum in 1882. \nLit. O.

Victoria & Albert Museum, HMSO, London, 1990. p.xix-xx\n\nJohn Jones (1800-1882) was first in business as a tailor and army clothier in London 1825, and opened a branch in Dublin 1840.  Often visited Ireland, travelled to Europe and particularly France.  He retired in 1850, but retained an interest in his firm.  Lived quietly at 95 Piccadilly from 1865 to his death in January 1882.  After the Marquess of Hertford and his son Sir Richard Wallace, Jones was the principal collector in Britain of French 18th century fine and decorative arts.  Jones bequeathed an important collection of French 18th century furniture and porcelain to the V&A, and among the British watercolours and oil paintings he bequeathed to the V&A are subjects which reflect his interest in France.  \n\nSee also <u>South Kensington Museum Art Handbooks.

Pictures,... and other things</u>, p.138, \"The pictures which are included in the Jones bequest are, with scarcely a single exception, valuable and good; and many of them excellent works of the artists.  Mr. Jones was well pleased if he could collect enough pictures to ornament the walls of his rooms, and which would do no discredit to the extraordinary furniture and other things with which his house was filled.\"\n\nHistorical significance: This painting which attribution has been long discussed represents a popular mythological episode narrated by the Ancient Roman author Ovid in the Metamorphoses (1:452 ff). According to Ovid, Apollo, the Sun god, was stricken by Cupid, the god of Love, with a golden arrow and immediately fell in love with the nymph Daphne, daughter of the river God Peneus. When, too tired to flee, Daphne asked her father for help, she was turned into a tree. She is here traditionally represented fleeing from Apollo, her arms upraised and already sprouting while Cupid up in the sky along with a little putto is pointing his bow and arrow towards the couple. Peneus, the river God, is seen from the back in the shadow on the lower left corner reclining on his overturned urn. \nThe painting most likely belongs to the Roman circle of the end of the 17th century and shows the influence of the leading painter in Rome at that time, Carlo Maratta, whose art, inspired by the great masters of the late century, including Raphael and Annibale Carracci, unites the virtue of <i>disegno</i> and <i>colore</i> and anticipates somehow the development of the Rococo and Neo-classicism. This composition may indeed derive from Maratta's <i>Apollo and Daphne</i>, dated 1681, Mus\u00e9es Royaux des Beaux-Arts, Brussels, which represented in a much brighter, pastel-like palette the exact same moment in the story of Apollo and Daphne executed with a neat and delicate brushwork, which is also an essential characteristic of this painting. Analogously the figures are captured mid stride in an elegant and graceful pose. The colouring is however much darker and the large atmospheric sky bathing this compositions into a delicate chiaroscuro significantly differs from Maratta's tonality but is reminiscent of Nicolas Poussin (<i>Apollo and Daphne,</i> 1625, Alte Pinakothek, Munich). \nIt is said that Maratta used to challenge his pupils to execute their own version of his composition, which partly explained the many versions of identical subject matter during the Baroque period. For instance, Francesco Trevisani (1656-1746), one of Maratta's famous pupils, depicted the same scene based on a very similar compositional idea (The Hermitage, St Petersburg).",

            "historical_context_note": "History painting, i.e. depictions of non recurring events based on religious, classical, literary or allegorical sources, particularly developed in Italy during the Renaissance (15th-16th centuries). History painting could include religious themes, or depictions of momentous recent events, but the term was most frequently associated with Classical subject-matter. However a renewed impetus was given to religious subjects after the Council of Trent (1545-63), which stipulated new iconographical programmes. The development of art treatises, in which the compositional rules guiding the art of painting were discussed also notably, influenced the evolution of history painting. From around 1600 history painting's principal rivals: still-life, landscape and genre painting began to emerge as independent collectable genres. Furthermore, the Rococo taste for the ornamental in the early 18th century prioritised the decorative quality of history painting, so that subject matters became more entertaining than exemplary. There was a renewed interest in history painting during the Neo-Classical period after which the taste for such pictures faded towards the end of the 19th century when an innovative approach to the image was led by the Symbolists and was developed further by subsequent schools in the early 20th century.",
