The incident took place in 1572 as the Mughal army moved west in a major campaign against the sultanate of Gujarat. On the way, envoys of the chief of Sirohi were received by the Mughal general, Khan-i Kalan. As they were about to depart, one of them suddenly lunged forward and stabbed the general. In retaliation, Khan-i Kalan's companions immediately killed the attacker and others who were with him. The incident made Akbar decide to take personal command of a force to crush the rebellion in Sirohi.\nThe Akbarnama (Book of Akbar) was commissioned by the emperor in 1598 as the official chronicle of his reign. It was written by his court historian and biographer Abu'l Fazl, and was substantially completed by 1596. The illustrations were being painted as the historian drafted and rewrote his text by at least forty-nine different artists from Akbar's ketabkhana, or 'House of Books', where manuscripts were stored as well as created. After Akbar's death in 1605, the incomplete manuscript remained in the library of his son, Jahangir (r. 1605-1627), who recorded his possession on the flyleaf. The Victoria and Albert Museum purchased it in 1896 from Mrs Frances Clarke, the widow of Major General John Clarke, an official who had been the Commissioner in Oudh province between 1858 and 1862.",
