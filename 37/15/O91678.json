Subsequently when the marks were deciphered, it was reclassed as by Quarnberg of Wiborg \u2018though made in the manner of the late 17th century\u2019. In style the piece is characteristic of the first half of the 18th century and the initials J: G: for a subsequent owner on the back date from the late eighteenth or early nineteenth century. Finnish silver follows the usual evolution of decorative styles, however provincially and belatedly, and it is intrinsically improbable that a piece of this type and quality was made in the nineteenth century. A much more plausible explanation is that it was marked or remarked on passing through Quarnberg\u2019s shop. In fact the present base seems to be a replacement covering an earlier base.\nRemarked?\n\nPurchase - (\u00a314.10.9 for M.520-522-1910) GA Sandell, Kuusa Eisenbahnstation, Finland",
