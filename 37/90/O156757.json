            "public_access_description": "This box is part of a small group of Meissen boxes made in the shape of envelopes. An inscription in French on the cover dedicates it 'To the most faithful, wherever she is found.' The inside cover shows a view of London, with St Olaf's church in the foreground, Old London Bridge and the Tower of London seen from the south bank of the river Thames. The box may have been commissioned from Meissen by an English customer.\n\nSnuffboxes made out of porcelain followed the shapes of those made in gold and hardstones. Painted scenes or portraits ornamented the sides, covers and interiors. Changing forms and decoration were important, as these fashion accessories might be chosen to match the season or a particular costume. Most European (though rarely English) porcelain factories made snuffboxes. The largest producer was Meissen in Germany, which manufactured vast quantities of boxes from about 1735-65. A price list of 1765 mentions 11 varieties, the cheapest painted with flowers.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
