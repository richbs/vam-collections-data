From July to December 1866 he toured a part of the Himalayan region. He wrote about his journey in The British Journal of Photography, outlining his route and in some cases describing the scenes of which he took photographs.\n\nThis is his description of this view: 'Next day our march followed the course of a stream that descended from the Jalori Pass\u2026.Looking back towards the pass, the hillsides were wooded to their summits, and the little stream, swollen by yesterday's heavy rain tumbled over its boulders in a foamy mass, forming a sinuous line of silver through the dense foliage. The day was cloudy and dull; but I halted to get a picture of this fine sylvan scene, and of another almost as fine looking the other way. I had some difficulty in doing this, as my cloths and polishing leathers were all still very damp from yesterday's soaking. However I overcame this difficulty, and secured two as good negatives (12 x 10) as was possible on a cloudy day.'",

Below is the relevant section for this photograph: \n\nFrom the village of Kat they had to cross the Jalori Pass, about 11,000 feet elevation. They climbed to the top of the Pass and stopped near a village called Russala. \n\n'Next day our march followed the course of a stream that descended from the Jalori Pass, the path running some distance above it along the slopes of the mountains which formed one side of a narrow valley. About a mile below our encampment we had a fine view. Looking back towards the pass, the hillsides were wooded to their summits, and the little stream, swollen by yesterday's heavy rain tumbled over its boulders in a foamy mass, forming a sinuous line of silver through the dense foliage. The day was cloudy and dull; but I halted to get a picture of this fine sylvan scene, and of another almost as fine looking the other way. I had some difficulty in doing this, as my cloths and polishing leathers were all still very damp from yesterday's soaking. However I overcame this difficulty, and secured two as good negatives (12 x 10) as was possible on a cloudy day.'\n\nThis photograph would be the first one described by Bourne in his writings and the second photograph he mentions would be museum number 53,064.\n\nBourne, S, A Photographic journey through the Higher Himalayas, The British Journal of Photography, December 3 1869, pg 579.",
