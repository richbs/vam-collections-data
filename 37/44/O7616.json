            "public_access_description": "This roundel is one of six acquired by the museum in 1923 (Museum nos.C.123-128-1923). It was originally from a set of 12 roundels depicting the \u2018Labours of the Months\u2019. The museum purchased them from the sale of the contents of Cassiobury Park in Hertfordshire. They had probably been installed in the windows of the house when it was remodelled in the early years of the 19th century. We do not know where they were located before that date.\n\nThe depiction of the months and occupations associated with them appear early in the Medieval period on church facades and interiors. They also appear in illuminated manuscripts and start to become more common in stained glass in the 14th and, especially, the 15th  centuries.\n\nThe occupations depicted in these \u2018Labours of the Months\u2019 are mostly agricultural and are thus intimately associated with the landed class and their agricultural labourers. They appear in both religious and secular settings.\n\n\u2018Labours of the Months\u2019 are found all throughout Europe and the occupations depicted are standard but do vary in accordance with the local climate. Harvesting, for instance, began earlier in the year in Southern Europe. Feasting and drinking scenes, mostly aristocratic in form, appear in either December or January in all European countries. These months are traditionally associated with major festivals in the Church year and the consumption of large quantities of meat. Much livestock was killed at this time of year to provide food over the winter months.\n\nSome of the \u2018Labours of the Months\u2019 stained glass roundels believed to have been painted in England share the same imagery. This imagery must have come from a common source, most likely from a series of woodblock engravings which may have circulated between the glazing workshops. \n\nDiagonally across the centre of this roundel a farm labourer is leading a team of two horses. The horses are pulling a harrow across a field. Harrows were dragged across ploughed fields to break up the clumps of soil. Another farm labourer is in the foreground of the roundel spreading seed over the newly-harrowed field. The seed is probably wheat (\u2018winter wheat\u2019) or rye. This was a common occupation in the autumn months and the letters on the scroll in the centre of the panel indicate that the activity is taking place in the month of October.\n\nThe paintwork on this roundel is very detailed and highly skilled, indicating the work of a prominent glass-painting workshop. The techniques employed include \u2018stickwork\u2019 which makes use of a stylus to scrape away areas of paint to produce highlights, as seen in the man\u2019s hose and on the horse in the background.  Smear shading and stipple-shading are used to create depth in the background and texture in the figures\u2019 tunics and headwear.",
