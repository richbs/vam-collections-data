It stands on 2 front legs and a flattened underside; has ornamental grooves cut into the surface and is partly glazed. The underside and base of front legs are not glazed but covered with a light terra cotta wash. This makes it looks as if earthenware had been used but white clay is revealed on the small chip at the back of the tail.",
