They were often known as 'joined' or 'joint' stools because the framework is constructed entirely using mortice-and-tenon joints. In the 16th and 17th centuries stools were also made from boards nailed together, or with turned legs wedged at an angle into a solid seat, the type popularly known as 'milking-stools'.\n\nOn loan to the Elizabethan House, Plymouth.",
