She set up her own wallpaper company in the early 1980s and applied hand-painting techniques to rice paper. Rice paper alone is too fragile to use as wallpaper so it is backed with a stronger paper for strength and durability. Larkin's papers are produced in 40\" wide rolls instead of the standard 29\".  The majority of her designs use metallic pigments, or gold or silver leaf. Larkin's papers are used in a number of hotels, restaurants and department stores in the USA, and also on the QEII cruise ship.",
