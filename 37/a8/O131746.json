As an apprentice to his father, he made figures in clay, attracting the interest of the portrait painter Alexander Mosses (1793-1837). Studied in his spare time at the drawing school of the Royal Institution, Liverpool, and apprenticed to a local painter and engraver. Achieved local success as a portrait painter and for his 'candlelight' studies, and exhibited frequently at the Liverpool Academy from 1831, although he did not become a member. Exhibited seven works at the RA in 1840 and 1846, all single figure studies such as a beggar and a friar, except for the portrait of ' Sir Joshua Walmsley' (see p65) who seems to have been his chief patron. The <i>Magazine of Art</i> writer recorded that he 'lived boisterously ... But he also felt the fascination of strong drink'; he is supposed to have declined to paint Prince Albert. He died at Everton, 13 October 1880. \n\nLIT: <i>Magazine of Art</i> June 1882, pp341-3; H C Marillier <i>The Liverpool School of Painters</i> 1904, pp95-8 \n\n<b>Sir Joshua Walmsley, MP</b> \n368-1872 Neg H311 \nCanvas, 92.7 x 70.5 cm (36\u00bd x 27\u00be ins) \nBequeathed by Sir Joshua Walmsley 1872 \nPresumably the portrait exhibited at the RA in 1846. \n\nSir Joshua Walmsley (1794-1871) was a corn merchant, advocate of the repeal of the corn laws, and friend and business associate of George Stephenson (see 364-1872, above). Elected member of Liverpool town council 1835, Mayor 1838, knighted 1840; as a Liberal, unsuccessfully contested Liverpool for Parliament 1841, elected for Leicester 1847 (but soon unseated), Bolton 1849, and Leicester again 1852-7. In 1855/6 introduced a Bill, unsuccessfully, to open the British Museum and other public institutions on Sundays. He was Daniels's chief patron; according to his son's biography, Sir Joshua expected 'great things' from the artist. In 1846, Daniels sent paintings, including a portrait of Sir Joshua, to the RA from the Walmsley home address at Ranton (not Rauton, as misprinted in the RA catalogue) Abbey, Eccleshall, Staffordshire. \n\nMarillier considered this portrait 'powerful and vivid'. According to his son, another portrait of Sir Joshua, by Illidge (presumably Thomas Henry Illidge), was given to Lady Walmsley. \n\nEXH: RA 1846 (461) \n\nLIT: H M Walmsley <i>The Life of Sir Joshua Walmsley</i> 1879, pp 7 6-7\"",
