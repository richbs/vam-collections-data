He also designed furniture and textiles, and was very influential abroad. His work at Darmstadt, Germany for the Duke of Hesse, performed around 1900, is one of the major architectural and design projects of the period. He used embroidery, particularly appliqu\u00e9, to decorate the textiles in his interiors.\n\nThe three panels of this screen, each with a pair of birds sitting in a stylised tree, were designed by Baillie Scott and embroidered by his wife, with silks in stem and satin stitches. Each tree has a stem of plaited silver braid, and a gold cord edges the appliqu\u00e9. It was exhibited in the Arts & Crafts exhibition of 1896.",
