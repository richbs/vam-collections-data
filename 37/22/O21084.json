As with most decorated delftwares, these had a dual function as bowls for food (perhaps fruit or nuts) and as room decoration.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThough rare today, these dishes were made in huge numbers by several large London potteries, first in Southwark and later also in Lambeth. The method of manufacture suggests the speed and economy with which these dishes were made. Only the front is covered with expensive opaque-white tin-glaze while the back is simply lead-glazed, and there are scars on the front (concealed by the decoration) where the dishes were stacked together face-down in the kiln, separated only by small clay 'stilts'.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe very limited range of oxide colours available to 17th-century delftware potters did not deter them from painting exotic flowers. The bold tulips, lilies and carnations on this dish, which show a familiarity with the decoration on Italian and Netherlandish maiolica as well as on Turkish Iznikware, would have been considered quite exotic, partly because tulips would have been imported as not native to England.",
