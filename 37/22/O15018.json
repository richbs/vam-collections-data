She was awarded medals in 1863 'for the best photograph by an amateur' and in 1864 for 'the best group, or groups, or composition or compositions, each from a single negative'.  Lewis Carroll, who visited the exhibition, wrote in his diary: 'I did not admire Mrs Cameron's large heads, taken out of focus. The best of the life ones were Lady Hawarden's'. He bought five. Virginia Dodier has written of this image: 'Perhaps Clementina, in prophetess robes and headdress, appears here as her sister's guide, as in a dream'.\n\n5 Princes Gardens, interior: first floor, front: right window (not shown): screen: Clementina (three-quarter length), in fancy dress (prophetess: classical draperies, with star head-dress), eyes up, standing, right hand on Florence Elizabeth's right shoulder, left arm outstretched and pointing with forefinger, and Florence Elizabeth (half-length), in fancy dress (peasant bodice and skirt, with cape), eyes closed, seated, leaning right on Clementina's left side, both hands on glass of wine on French-style side-table.",
