These may have been the result of retouching in 1831. On the back Constable notes that the retouching was done at Hampstead, on the day after the Coronation of King William IV, which he had attended. He said that he had been \u2018eleven hours in the [Westminster] Abbey'.\n\nConstable's grasp of linear perspective is still not perfect, even at this late date in his career. His real interest is in the contrast between light and shadow. Although the watercolour gives more solid blocks of tone than pen or pencil, it is applied with visible diagonal brushstrokes. This gives it a linear quality.",

Leslie, pp. 37-8).\nThis sheet comes from the sketch-book used earlier in 1821 in Berkshire (see note following No. 219 [355-1888]).  As noted by Holmes, p. 245, there is a drawing of the same bridge from a near-by viewpoint in the British Museum (L.B. 29).  This is dated 23 November 1829, and comes from the sketch-book measuring 9 \u00bc x 13 \u00bc ins. (234 x 337 mm.) which Constable used in that year (see note following No. 319).  Possibly Constable made use of the latter drawing when retouching No. 240 [218-1888] on 9 September 1831.\nTimothy Wilcox, <u>Constable and Salisbury.
