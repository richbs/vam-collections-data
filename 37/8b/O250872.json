Ignazio di Loyola. by leading architect and designer Sir William Chambers (1723-1796). The Pantheon was built as a Roman temple in AD 118-125. In this drawing comparative sections of both a flat pilaster and one set into the return angle of a corner are shown for each building. This drawing is made up of two sheets, which have recently been re-united. \n\nChambers moved to London in 1755 and published his influential Treatise on Civil Architecture in 1759.  Chambers demonstrated the breadth of his style in buildings such as Gower (later Carrington) House and Melbourne House, London, in such country houses as Duddingston, Scotland, and in the garden architecture he designed for Wilton House, Wiltshire, and at Kew Gardens. He became head of government building in 1782, and in this capacity built Somerset House, London.",
