It is comparatively inexpertly made, yet it has a rustic appeal that was often part of the marketable charm of  small but commercial potteries.\n\nDesign & Designing\nMade of earthenware, with hand-carved decoration, this vase would have been a relatively simple and inexpensive piece for a student.  The red earthenware and the green and blue glazes were typical of many south and south-western potteries, and these materials would have been readily available to Salisbury School of Art. The foliate patterning was encouraged, as design teaching probably included drawing from nature.",
