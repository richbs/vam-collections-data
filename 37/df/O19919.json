The close-fitting cloche hat was extremely popular at the time. A simple modern design, it was an easy to wear unfussy style of hat which fitted snugly over fashionably closely-cropped hairstyles. \n\nThe decoration on this hat consists of blue ostrich feathers which are cleverly bound around the hat, keeping the tight-fitting silhouette but adding an element of decorative movement.",
