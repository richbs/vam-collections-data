Simon Patterson reproduced it faithfully, in its typography, composition and steel frame, replacing only the names of the stations with the names of famous (for whatever reason) men and women. The relationships between them, set up by their positions in line and the lines they appear in, seem sometimes to follow set patterns (a sequence of film stars or a sequence of saints, for example) but then the pattern is broken and we are presented with new, if unlikely, connections.As the title suggests, the map has been wittily reinvented as a constellation of 'stars' in the galaxy of fame.",
