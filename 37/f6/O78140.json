By the late 19th century wallpapers were widely used by all classes, in homes and also in public buildings.\n\nPlaces\nThis wallpaper was designed especially for the Palace of Westminster. The pattern incorporates references to its purpose. The crowned portcullis is the symbol for the Palace, and the crowned flower is the Tudor rose, a Royal emblem. The letters 'V' and 'R' stand for Victoria Regina - Queen Victoria. The design was intended to symbolise the authority of Crown and Parliament.\n\nDesign & Designing\nA.W.N. Pugin (1812-1852) was responsible for the design of almost all the furnishings of the Palace of Westminster, including more than a hundred wallpapers.Pugin was a leading design reformer. He held strong views on what was appropriate in the decoration of domestic furnishings. In particular he believed that flat surfaces such as walls should be decorated only with flat patterns, and not patterns that gave the illusion of depth and substance.",
