The lines on the plate are filled with ink, which is then printed onto paper.\n\nPeople\nWendel Dietterlin was born in Pfullendorf on Lake Constance but later became a citizen of the Protestant city of Strasbourg, where he lived for much of his life. He belonged to the local guild of artists, decorators and painters and was chiefly a mural and fresco painter, although none of his work of this kind survives. Dietterlin is remembered for publishing a large and very influential series of architectural prints, which this etching is taken from. He died before he was 50, having mentioned in the dedication to his book a long and painful illness.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nIn the title the author explains that his examples of the use of the five orders of architecture include windows, chimneys, door frames, portals, fountains, tombs and monuments. Some of them are very fanciful and demonstrate the artist's powerful and playful imagination. In this example Dietterlin created a version of the Doric order. His adaptations can be see in the proportions of the columns with their rusticated blocks half-way up the shaft, the mouldings of the column bases, and the unusal triglyphs in the frieze. These have three vertical grooves instead of the two vertical grooves with half grooves at the edges that was correct.\n\nPublishing \nDietterlin  began publishing prints relating to the five orders of architecture in 1593 in Stuttgart, where he was painting a ceiling for Duke Ludwig VI of W\u00fcrttemberg. He published further plates in 1594 and an enlarged definitive edition in Nuremburg in 1598. Each book was published with a parallel text in Latin and French and with separate editions in German. These prints were very influential among architects and craftsmen, who used them as design sources. Copies of the book have become scarce as they would often have been used literally until they fell apart. Some of the plates were published separately from 1617 and the original plates were reprinted in 1655.",
