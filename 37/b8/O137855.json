It is shaped like the large house shrines found in major churches, which contained the bodies of saints.  This shape was typical of reliquaries enamelled in Limoges, and reflected intentionally their function as resting places for holy relics.  Here the connection is made even more explicit by the use of decoration that echoes the palla or funeral cloth placed over such shrines on special occasions.",

Gauthier 1987 points out the combination of representations of saints with the lower side decorated by the palla (a funerary veil placed on the tombs of saints) and the foliage of the Garden of Paradise.  She suggests that this combines the idea of a saint's actual tomb with references to his/her current resting place, Heaven. \n\nShe also compares the two rows of figures, with their feet pointing outwards, the drapery style and the varying gestures, to early Christian sarcophagi.",
