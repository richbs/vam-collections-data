The silk was woven by Daniel Walters & Sons in Braintree in Essex who had been in business since 1820. By the mid-19th century the firm was recognised as the leading British silk manufacturers, and  employed between 200 and 300 people. The firm produced silk furnishings for a number of important commissions, including Windsor Castle and Buckingham Palace. It was taken over by Warner & Sons in 1894.\n\nIn  1845 the House of Commons granted \u0153150,000  to enlarge Buckingham Palace, which was considered inadequate for royal entertaining. Between 1851 and 1856 a new suite of entertaining rooms was built on the south side of the Palace.  This included a ballroom designed by Ludwig Gruner. Prince Albert had significant control over the scheme, which showed his interest in Raphael and Italianate design.   The Queen's 'fine new room' was opened with a ball on 8 May 1856; both she and Prince Albert were delighted with it.",
