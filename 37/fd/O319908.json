The linen lining is plain weave; undyed; approx. 22 x 22 tpc (sys 1 x sys 2). The silk cap appears to be made from four pieces of fabric.  Two pieces form 2/3 of the cap and are sewn to meet in the centre/top. These form the front. The other two, smaller pieces form the final 1/3 of the cap. This is at the back. The fabric has blue (approx. 25mm wide) and pink stripes (approx. 17mm wide). Some pink stripes are edged with thin, buff lines and have two other thin, buff stripes along it, approx. 7mm apart.  At the front of the head the stripes run blue; pink(with stripes); blue; pink (without stripes); blue. The back portion of fabric has stripes that do not match up. The front, right side of the cap is damaged with holes in the fabric.\n\nThe silk, one formed into the cap shape, has been hemmed onto a thin stripe of blue, dyed linen (poorly dyed). Undyed stripes are still visible on this hem. This is sewn onto the lining with a whip stitch using blue, linen thread. Two parallel lines of running stitch (in blue, linen thread) go around the edge of the cap, with one of the lines hidden beneath the linen hem. \n\nThe lining is made from two semi-circular pieces. The pieces are not connected at the centre. Along this centre line are four, parallel lines of stitching in blue, linen thread in a running stitch. Two one either side of the centre, 5mm between each line. These lines end approx. 20mm before the edge of the cap. It is possible that these threads could be pulled to tighten the cap for a closer fit?\n\nOne portion of a tie still remains to allow to tie beneath the chin (broken off from it's tab on the side of the cap). Approx. 5mm wide x 11.5mm long. The tab on the other side also remains. Both are sewn to the cap with blue, linen thread (approx 0.8 mm thick). The ties are made from linen, dyed blue (the dye has not held well) with stripes of undyed linen. The blue dye has leaked onto the undyed threads.",
