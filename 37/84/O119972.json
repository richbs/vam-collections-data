In Britain, he became known as Punch.\n\nAlthough badly damaged, the figure is of interest because of its provenance. It was found in the grounds of Holland House, the London house of Sir Charles Hanbury-Williams, who was the British Envoy at Dresden court. In 1748, while stationed at Dresden, Hanbury-Williams was presented with diplomatic gifts of Meissen porcelain, and three years later he lent examples of Meissen from Holland House to the Chelsea factory in order for copied to be made. It is possible that this figure was originally owned by him. \n\nThe figure was modelled by the Chelsea factory modeller Joseph Willems, who copied a Meissen porcelain figure modelled by J. J. K\u00e4ndler in 1748. Only one other version in Chelsea porcelain is known.",
