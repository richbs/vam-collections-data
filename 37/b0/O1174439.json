Opened by Prince Phillip on 23  April 1964, the exhibition celebrated the quatercentenary of Shakespeare's birth  and aimed to portray the world of Tudor England as it may have appeared to  Shakespeare, but it was criticised for elements of gimmickry, a confusing mixture  of styles, an exhibition guide that was hard to follow, and Buckle's  extravagance. Nevertheless, Hugo's canvases depict Stratford in the  understated, tranquil and lyrical style to which Buckle was so attracted.\n\nJean Hugo was born in Paris the great-grandson of the poet and novelist Victor  Hugo. He was a painter, illustrator, theatre designer and author, whose artistic  career spanned the 20th century and whose work brought him into contact with  many of the most influential artistic figures of the 20th century including Jean Cocteau, Pablo Picasso, Paul Elouard, Francis Poulenc, Max Jacob,  Cecil Beaton and many others.",
