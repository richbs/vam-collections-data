By the end of the war, many fashion houses had closed and it was said by Time magazine that Dior was \"holding up the entire French fashion industry\".  \n\nThis dress gets fullness from its large loops of silk taffeta, a stiff fabric known for holding its shape. A cocktail-length Dior dress, such as this one, was typically made of twenty-five yards of fabric. The dress would have been worn with a petticoat of stiff tulle for even greater fullness.",
