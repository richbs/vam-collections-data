            "public_access_description": "Sir Edwin Landseer (1803-1873) was a prodigious artistic talent from an early age, entering the Royal Academy schools aged only 14.  He was proficient both as a painter and a draughtsman and was elected a Royal Academician in 1831. During a long and distinguished career he exhibited 179 works at the Royal Academy and 94 at the British Institute.  He enjoyed the patronage of the Royal family and is especially well known for the paintings he did for them of the life and landscape of the Scottish Highlands.\n\nAlthough he painted portraits, Landseer's work predominantly deals with animals and human genre.  This particular painting was exhibited at the British Institute in 1840.  In his Catalogue of the Works of the Late Edwin Landseer, published in 1876, A. Graves states that the roebuck was shot by Lord Cosmo Russell, who was also the owner of the two upper dogs: Melody and Toddy.  The painting is a good example of Landseer's ability to portray a patron's favourite dogs in an imaginative composition.",

            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of British Oil Paintings 1820-1860</i>, Ronald Parkinson, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1990, p. 150\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"<b>LANDSEER, Sir Edwin Henry, RA </b>(1803-1873) \nBorn London 7 March 1803, fourth of seven children of the engraver John Landseer. Studied with BR Haydon, entered the RA Schools 1817 (at the age of 14); won annual prizes of the Royal Society of Arts 1813-17. A precocious and prodigious talent, as both painter and draughtsman, he exhibited - in a long and distinguished career - 179 works at the RA between 1815 and 1873, 94 at the BI 1818-65, and four at the SBA 1826-32. \nSubjects included portraits, but predominantly dealt with animal and human genre, often based in Scotland. Elected ARA 1826 (at the earliest permitted age), RA 1831. Received the patronage of the Russell family, and - most importantly- that of the Royal family, to whom he was Drawing Master, beginning in 1836 with the Duchess of Kent (Queen Victoria's mother); most significantly, he represented in visual form the Queen and Prince Albert's love for the life and landscape of the Scottish Highlands. Together with George IV's celebrated visit to Edinburgh 1822, and the great popularity of Sir Waiter Scott's Waverley novels, Landseer's contribution to the place of Scotland in European culture in the 19th century was considerable. The artist's own popularity was increased by the great number of reproductive prints after his works (Graves alone lists 434 by 126 engravers, see Lit below); his 'Monarch of the Glen' (exh, RA 1851), commissioned by the House of Lords but the cost refused by the House of Commons, was eventually bought by Sir Thomas Dewar and reproduced on his family firm's whisky bottle labels. Also significant was his anthropomorphic treatment of animals, particularly dogs; the <u>Art Journal</u> obituarist stressed that 'his dogs are not mere portraits only, they are thinking, almost rational, creatures, wanting only the gift of speech to hold converse with us'. Knighted 1850; offered PRA 1865, but refused, almost certainly because of his poor physical and mental health. Died London 1 October 1873; buried in St Paul's Cathedral. His studio sale was at Christie's 8-15 May 1874; a commemorative exhibition was held at the RA 1874/5. After the Royal Collection, the V&A possesses the largest holding of Landseer's works; there are a great many drawings and prints as well as the oils catalogued below, principally from the Sheepshanks Gift, one of the artist's most important patrons. \n\nLIT: F G Stephens <u>The Early Works of Sir Edwin Landseer RA</u> 1869; J Dafforne <u>Pictures by Sir Edwin Landseer </u>... 1873; <u>Art Journal </u>1873, p326 (obit); interleaved copy of 1874 RA exhibition catalogue, annotated by C S Mann, with photographs of prints after Landseer, 1874-7,4 vols (National Art Library, V&A); A Graves <u>Catalogue of the Works of the Late Sir Edwin Landseer</u> 1876; C Monkhouse entry in DNB; C Lennie Landseer: Victorian Paragon 1976; R Ormond <u>Sir Edwin Landseer</u> Philadelphia Museum of Art and Tate Gallery exhibition catalogue 1981 (With full bibliography).\n\n<b>Young Roebuck and Rough Hounds</b> \nFA101 Neg HJ725 \nPanel, 53.3 X 43.2 cm (21 X 17 ins) \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \nExhibited at the BI in 1840. Graves states that the roebuck was shot by Lord Cosmo Russell, who was also the owner of the two upper dogs, Melody and Toddy. The work is a spirited example of Landseer's exceptional ability to portray a patron's favourite dogs in an imaginative composition. Landseer had painted Lord Cosmo at the age of seven in 1824 (RA 1825, repr Ormond p63). \nWaagen thought 'the truth of detail and masterly character of the execution are here and the chief attractions, for the composition is little interesting'. Twenty years later Dafforne remarked on the 'wonted skill and accuracy of the artist and here self-evident; but the subject is far from agreeable, for the roebuck lies dead among some rocks, and one of the four dogs which surround it is licking up the blood that flows from a wound in its neck'. \nAn oil study, 'Deer and Rough Hounds', was sold at Christie's 18 November 1911 (59, 29.2 X 21.6 cm/ll\u00bdX 8\u00bdins); bought Schroeder \u00a321 1s; a drawing of ' Roe buck and Rough Hounds' was sold at Christie's 16 May 1913 (11, 50 X 40.6 cm/19\u00be X 16 ins), bought Harding \u00a373 10s \n\nEXH: BI 1840 (1); <i>Victorian Painting </i>Nottingham University Art Gallery 1959 (36);<i> Paintings and Drawings by Sir Edwin Landseer</i> RA RA 1961 (1); <i>Victorian Painting </i>Arts Council 1962 (35) \n\nENGR: BP Gibbon 1849 \n\nLIT: G Waagen <u>Treasures of Art in Great Britain</u> II, p300; <u>Dafforne </u>p20; Mann I, p160 (repr Gibbons engr); <u>Graves</u> no 277 (repr Gibbons engr): F G Stephens <u>Sir Edwin Landseer</u> 1881, p82 \n\nRonald Parkinson\"\nRichard Ormond, <u>Monarch of the Glen: Landseer in the Highlands</u>.
