The retaining wall and pavilion in the right hand corner give way to a dramatic view of Esthwaite Water \u2013 in Potter\u2019s opinion the most beautiful of the lakes. \n\nEsthwaite Water is one of the smaller lakes of the Lake District, situated between Windermere and Coniston Water. It is the closest lake to the village of Near Sawrey. Potter visited the village on family holidays and later settled there at Castle Cottage (and bought other farms, properties and land in the area). Potter has said that Sawrey is Jeremy Fisher's home and it is widely thought that Esthwaite Water served as the backdrop for many of the illustrations for The Tale of Mr Jeremy Fisher published in 1906.\n\nBeatrix Potter (1866-1943) is one of the world's best-loved children's authors and illustrators. She wrote the majority of the twenty-three original Peter Rabbit books between 1901 and 1913. The Tale of Peter Rabbit (Frederick Warne, 1902) is her most famous and best-loved tale.",
