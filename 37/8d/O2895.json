Extensive glass table services became increasingly popular towards the end of the 19th century, especially with the introduction of machine-pressed glass. This example, however,  is decorated by hand with wheel-cut ornament.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThis piece is made of lead glass. In the 17th century a higher proportion of lead oxide was introduced into glass during manufacture to offset the problems of 'crizzling' (a fine network of tiny internal fissures within the body of the glass). The resultant lead glass was clear and brilliant, and especially suited to cut decoration. Cut patterns are created using rotating disks of various materials and sizes, with a stream of water and an abrasive. First the pattern is painted on the surface and intitially rough-cut. It is then refined with a copper or sandstone wheel, and finally the finished object is polished. Steam-powered wheels were introduced in the early 19th century.\n\nPeople\nJohn Davenport (1765-1848)  founded his own company in Longport, Staffordshire, in about 1797 to make earthenware, hybrid hard-paste porcelain and bone china;  on his death his son William took over  and continued trading until 1887.  John Davenport expanded into glassmaking in 1801 and the company became well known for high-quality plain, cut and engraved tablewares.",
