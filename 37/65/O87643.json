He lies on his right side on a couch with turned legs, from the front part of which hangs drapery in wide looping folds. The Buddha leans his head on his right hand on a cushion, with the nimbus curving behind his head. Mahakasyapa, the monk, touches the Buddha's feet in silent mourning; he is seen bending forward in near profile to the left. At the bed head we see Vajrapani, holding the thunderbolt in his lowered right hand, throwing back his head in grief. Behind the Buddha's couch appears the upper half body of the Malla prince (the Malla princes later undertook the distribution of the Buddha's relics). The prince, too has thrown back his head in anguish, this movement causing his long necklace to slip to one side. In the background, behind the head and the foot of the death-bed, a sala tree is shown, indicating the grove of Kusinagara.",
