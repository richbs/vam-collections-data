            "physical_description": "Vase. Bronze, round the neck is a twisted band.\nThis vase is of the Yuan dynasty, and is very similar to excavated material (R.K.). There seem to be a number of repairs to the body metal.\nAnalyses of the body, a repair, and the base, were carried out, using non-intrusive EDXRF methods. The results for the body metal showed that it was composed of copper and lead, with much smaller amounts of tin and zinc. Silver was present at the level to be expected of an impurity. The tin and zinc comprised less than 5%beetween them. The original colour is likely to have been quite close to that of pure copper, because of the low concentration of alloying components. The tin and zinc are so low that it does not seem obvious if  they were deliberate additions or not. Perhaps some scrap metal had been used in the melt, with new copper diluting it. The lead content is above that to be expected by accident, and it would have reduced the melting point of the metal, as well as increasing the fluidity of the melt.\nThe base Is almost pure copper, with a tiny amount of lead present. Less than 1% of lead would not have affected the colour or properties of the copper to any great extent, so the material would be soft and reddish when fresh. Sheet copper is relatively easy to make, and can be cut to shape.\nSome cold hammering could increase the hardness, allowing quite a durable base to be made. The repair material analysed has been made from a lead-tin solder, although its composition did not match any of the modern standards very closely. The melting point would be low when compared with that of an ordinary casting copper alloy. The work could be carried out easily, in contrast with casting-on or other procedures requiring great heat and effort.",
