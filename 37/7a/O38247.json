It was acceptable that garments could be inexpensive and even of poor quality as long as they were fashionable: the aim was novelty and variety of choice in one's clothes, rather than having fewer garments but of good quality.  As so many of the garments which made up this look could be quickly and cheaply copied at home, many families did so, and commercial examples from the leading designers of children's clothing of the period, such as Mary Quant and Barbara Hulanicki, are quite rare survivals.",
