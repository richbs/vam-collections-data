            "physical_description": "The painting describes three female kitchen staff making kimch\u2019i under a persimmon tree. The young standing woman is dressed in a yellow ch\u014fgori (traditional jacket) and a black ch\u2019ima (traditional skirt) while her co-worker on the right wears a pink ch\u014fgori with a black ch\u2019ima. They both wear a white apron and their sleeves are rolled up ready for work. The seated woman on the left wears a western-style brown jacket over a green shirt. They all tied their hair in a colourful scarf.\nIn the background, deep-orange persimmons and pink azaleas indicate the autumn season. In the foreground, paech\u2019u cabbages, white and purple radishes, leeks and dried red chilli peppers are piled on the m\u014fngs\u014fk (straw mat). A large and a small white jar with lid, respectively decorated with pink and blue flowers, are placed on the mat in front of the vegetables. They probably contain ingredients like salt and saeuch\u014ft (shrimp paste) necessary for preparing the kimch\u2019i. A wooden chopping board with left over pieces of a chopped radish is placed on top of a large stainless steel container heaving with radish cubes.\nCabbages on the m\u014fngs\u014fk are thoroughly washed in the blue bucket filled with water running from an adjacent tap. They are then neatly piled on a low table covered with a green table cloth. The adjoining main table is covered with a white table cloth. A blue pot holding the kimjang (red pickling paste) and a spoon, a large brass container brimming with kimch\u2019i and a white plate with a half pickled cabbage are set on the table. The yellow ch\u014fgori woman likely made the kimch\u2019i as she holds the pink rubber gloves used for protecting hands from the burning and colouring of red chilli flakes. The seated woman smiles and gives a thumb up for the kimch\u2019i made by the young woman. In response, the young woman blushes and shyly laughs, bringing her right hand in front of her lips. \nThe kimch\u2019i making is a notorious social event for Korean women as it provides the opportunity to catch up with female family members and friends while preparing food for the upcoming winter. The painting vehiculates a theme which was reproduced many times in North Korean posters and paintings, describing the blissful domestic life of a North Korean woman in a country brimming with food, a sharp contrast to the actual lifestyle in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\nThe painting is dated and signed by the artist in the lower right corner.",
