They were appropriate riding head wear for aristocratic women, and were worn indoors and out by middle-class and gentry women.  \n\nHat-making was a complicated procedure and by the 17th century it was often divided into the two crafts of felt-making and hatting.  In the former, the fur -- either beaver or rabbit -- was removed from the pelt and shaped and felted into a cone-shaped hood.  The hatter purchased these felt hoods and shaped them over a wooden block to create the desired height of crown and width of brim.  The hats were then dyed, smoothed and trimmed.",
