The Royal Jennerian Society was founded in 1803, more than 12,000 people being innoculated in the first eighteen months. The date of 1820 appears to be an alteration perhaps indicating that another state of this diploma was in use at an earlier date. This print was acquired with 7 cartoons for stained glass by Henry Singleton (1766-1839) for windows at Eaton Hall, Cheshire, rebuilt by William Porden c.1803-12.
