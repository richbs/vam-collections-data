            "physical_description": "Armchair with carved back and crest. The solid back is composed of one small above one large panel divided by a moulded rail; each panel is roughly chamfered on the reverse and carved with low relief floral ornament on the front. Above is a carved crest, and attached to both sides is a scrolled 'ear' bracket pegged and nailed to each stile, and shaped to 'clasp' the underside of the crest. (The right hand bracket is 3.7cm thick, the left hand one 2.7cm thick). An inlay band of alternating pale and dark chevrons runs along the front surfaces of both back stiles (above the seat), the crest (below the carving) and the mid-rail of the back. The lower back rail is moulded at the front, with ends mitred to meet the chamfer on the inner edge of the rear stile. Both this and the back mid-rail are roughly planed on the reverse. \n\nThe chair arms are supported on the turned front legs which extend above the seat level. Each arm is tenoned into its back stile (two pegs on the left, one on the right), and is morticed to receive the front leg/arm support, fixed with a single peg. The seat consists of two boards, grained side to side, both replacements, nailed into the front and side rails. The left rail is replaced, the right (moulded rail) is original. The moulded front rail (of riven oak) is triple-pegged, but it is not clear which are supplementary.With plain front stretcher and two plain side stretchers, all apparently original and repaired.\n\nThe back feet are probably cut down. The front feet are replacements, dowelled and glued in place. The number of extra peg holes and repairs suggests that this chair has been taken apart at least once. It displays many irregularities in the sizes of its part (eg right stile 7.5cm wide, the left one 6.5cm), which might (but do not necessarily) suggest that it has been constructed from parts with the inlay and the crest rail added.",
