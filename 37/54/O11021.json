The alternative of engraved silver medallions to be worn suspended  on ribbons was derived from contemporary Dutch practice. It was customary to have a portrait made during marriage negotiations between distant parties.\n\nHistorical Associations\nFrom 1614 the Catholic Infanta Maria (1606-1646), daughter of Philip III of Spain (ruled 1598-1621), was being considered as a suitable match for Prince Charles (1600-1649), son of James I (ruled 1603-1625). The King's daughter Elizabeth (1596-1662) had married the Protestant Elector Palatine of the Rhine, Frederick V (1596-1632), in 1613. After four years of negotiations, the Spanish terms proved unacceptable. In 1618 James I broke off the negotiations. Although the discussions were resumed in 1622 when the future King travelled to Spain with George Villiers, Ist Duke of Buckingham,  the scheme came to nothing. There was widespread rejoicing amongst the English, nervous of an alliance with a powerful Roman Catholic country. This rare medallion belongs to the earlier phase of the negotiations, before 1621, when  Phillip III, father of the Infanta, died.\n\nPeople\nSimon de Passe (possibly born in 1595, died 1647)  was born in Cologne and worked as an engraver in Utrecht in The Netherlands .He spent some time in Copenhagen working for Anne of Denmark's brother Christian IV, King of Denmark-Norway (ruled 1588-1648). In England he received orders from James I to produce a series of portrait medallions in silver, perhaps as gifts for favoured courtiers. One at least is dated 1616 and the series was completed by 1619.",
