The bare-footed Rana bows submissively before the prince, touching his knees as Mughal and Mewar nobles watch. Facing the Rana, kneeling on the ground to the right, the artist Nanha may be seen. In the foreground, outside the <i>qanats</i>, are four musicians on the left and an elephant with his rider on the right. Mountains fill the background, with a strip of blue sky above. This event took place at the Mughal encampment of Gogunda in Rajasthan. Within a tented enclosure, Khurram kneels on a golden throne. Most of the assembled Mughal and Rajasthani courtiers are identified by minute Persian inscriptions.",

The ruler, Rana Amar Singh, had long held out against the Mughal forces but after a lengthy campaign directed by Shah Jahan was forced to surrender in 1614. The artist, Nanha, has included himself kneeling at the right of the scene,  sketching a portrait of the Rana. The picture was made to  illustrate the Jahangirnama (\"Book of Jahangir\"), the memoirs written in Persian by Jahangir, as indicated by the catchword isolated against the white muslin jama of the man depicted in the bottom left hand corner, which would be repeated as the first word of the following page. Although Jahangir intended to have various illustrated copies made of his book, none are known to survive.",
