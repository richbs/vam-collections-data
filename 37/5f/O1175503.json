The design is not signed or dated but was probably created by Comelli in circa 1912. It shows a full length image of a woman dressed in an outfit inspired by circa 1830-50s fashion. The body of the dress is white and has a closely fitting bodice and a wide 'pleated' band of fabric running around a neckline which finishes just below the shoulders and ends in a deep 'V', just above the gold buckled belt at her waist. The skirt of the dress is arranged in stiff tiers of pleated white skirts each of which has a delicate scalloped edge. The top skirt is decorated with a border of orange, yellow and red leaved flowers. A vertical row of the same flowers features at the centre front of the skirt. A large crimson flower is pinned to the centre of  the bodice and a further spray of delicate red, orange, blue and green flowers is pinned to her hair. She also wears elbow length white gloves and a white fan.",
