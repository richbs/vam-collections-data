Medieval-style stained glass windows were revived in the 19th century and the firm of Morris, Marshall, Faulkner &amp; Co. was commissioned to create windows for both ecclesiastical and domestic settings. This panel comes from Myles Birket Foster's library window.\n\nPlaces\nIn 1861 the artist Myles Birket Foster (1825-1899) embarked upon the building of his Surrey home, 'The Hill', in Whitley. He chose the recently established firm of Morris, Marshall, Faulkner &amp; Co., who promoted functionalism in design and high standards of craftsmanship, to design its interior.\n\nSubject\nDepicting 'Architecture', this window is one of a series of four imaginary episodes from the honeymoon of King Ren\u00e9 of Anjou, said to have been inspired by Sir Walter Scott's popular novel 'Anne of Geierstein'. Though the novel was a favourite of Foster's, the series was originally designed to decorate a cabinet commissioned by the architect John P. Seddon (1827-1906). The cabinet was among the furniture shown at the International Exhibition of 1862.\n\nPeople\nThe King Ren\u00e9 series was devised, and this particular panel designed, by Ford Madox Brown (1821-1898), one of the original partners of Morris &amp; Co. Fashioned in jewel-like colours, it encapsulates the principles of 'invention, expression and good dramatic action' that Brown considered so important to stained-glass art.",
