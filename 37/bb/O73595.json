Crace) and father (Frederick Crace) were both involved in decorating Brighton Pavilion for George, Prince of Wales. The Pompeian style was one of their favourite styles for interior decoration, and remained so throughout the 19th century. Fanciful Neo-classical painted interior schemes had become fashionable towards the end of the 18th century. They were designed by architects like Robert Adam (1728-1792). Interest in this style intensified again in the 1860s. At this time a more accurate classical style was created, based on the close study of real ancient Roman interiors. A few had been miraculously preserved in great detail at Pompeii and Herculaneum. These towns near Naples in southern Italy had been covered with lava when Mount Vesuvius erupted in AD 79.",
