Georg Reyser produced a number of liturgical books for the Bishop of W\u00fcrzburg, Rudolf von Scherenberg. A missal is a service book containing texts needed for performing the Mass throughout the year. \n\nEarly printed books used type cut to resemble scripts. In books that were printed for a wealthier market, spaces might still be left for the addition of hand-drawn and illuminated initials, so that the finished work would resemble a manuscript. In this example even printed rubrics (initials, usually in red, marking important parts of the text; 'rubrica' is the Latin word for red) have been included, making the printing more expensive. The red lettering and black text would have to be printed separately and the printer would have had to ensure that each stage of printing registered correctly with the other. At this time the reform of the Mass in some parts of Germany included the requirement for monasteries to use identical texts, a requirement that would have been well served by the use of print.",

Part of a collection of illuminated manuscripts and specimens of typography and cuttings of various dates, which arrived 15 October 1892 in three portfolios.\n\nHistorical significance: This is a page from an early printed missal. It shows that there was a market for printed books in the Church. Early printed books used type cut to resemble scripts. In early printed books that were intended for a wealthier market, spaces might still be left for the addition of hand-drawn and illuminated initials, so that the finished work would resemble a manuscript; an alternative form of illustration would have been cheaper woodcuts. In this example printed rubrics have also been included, making the printing more expensive. The red lettering and black text would have to be printed separately and the printer would have had to ensure that the earlier printing registered correctly with the new. \n\nGeorg Reyser printed a number of works for liturgical use for the reforming Bishop of W\u00fcrzburg, F\u00fcrstbischof Rudolf von Scherenberg, including the Missale Herbipolense (or W\u00fcrzburg Missal) of 1484.\n\nAccording to Eberhard K\u00f6nig, one reason for a new market for printed bibles and missals at this time was the reform of the Mass in certain parts of Germany, including the requirement for all reform monasteries to have identical texts, which spurred monasteries to review their library collections ('New Perspectives on the History of Mainz Printing' in Hindman, Sandra L. (Ed.). <u>Printing the Written Word: The Social History of Books, circa 1450-1520</u>. Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press, 1991, pp. 143-173).",
