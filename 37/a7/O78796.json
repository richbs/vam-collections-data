It also contributed an element of luxury and colour, as well as providing an appropriate and highly visible place to show the owners' coats of arms or initials.\n\nMakers & Making\nThe reuse of  luxury materials was quite common and in this case more than one original dress or furnishing fabrics have been included. Such economy suggests and that this headcloth was probably not intended for the best bed. Even the richest households would make use of 'secondhand' materials, particularly expensive ones. The cream silk damask with couched embroidery may have once formed part of a bed tester or canopy that was suspended over the top of the bed. The red brocaded silk damask evidently also had another use before it was incorporated into this headcloth.",
