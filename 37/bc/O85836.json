It is thought to come from the parish church at Pf\u00e4ffikon. \t\n\nThe shield is supported by the figures of a wild man and a wild woman. In the late Middle Ages wild men were celebrated for their qualities of strength and potency. They also symbolised freedom. They frequently appear as supporters of heraldic shields, especially in Switzerland in the late 15th and 16th centuries.\n\nThis panel is of the highest quality. It can be closely connected with the early work of Lukas Zeiner, a glass painter and glazier. His name appears in the town records of Zurich between 1479 and 1512. Zeiner was a leading glass artist in the field of heraldic painting and his style, which featured a coat of arms with supporters within an elaborate canopy, set the stage for similar work for the next 100 years.\n\nThe commissioning of secular, heraldic glass was becoming more common in the 15th and 16th centuries. This was especially the case on the Continent, where the rules as to who could claim a coat of arms were more relaxed than they were in England. \nHeraldic shields with supporters of different types enjoyed great popularity in Switzerland over a long period.

ISBN 1851774041\nWild men, celebrated in the Late Middle Ages for their qualities of strength and potency and symbolizing freedom, frequently appear as supporters of heraldic shields, especially in Switzerland in the late fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. This panel shows the arms of the <font -i>Grafschaft</font -i>, or county, of Kyburg, north-east of Zurich, and is thought to come from the parish church at Pfaffikon, slightly to the south (for another panel of the Kyburg arms, of about the same date but without supporters, see J. Schneider, <font -i>Glasgemalde: Katalog der Sammlung des Schweizerisches Landesmuseums Zurich</font -i>, Stafa [1970], vol.i, cat. no.22). Heraldic shields with supporters of different types (see nos 52\u20143) enjoyed great popularity in Switzerland over a long period, especially in the secular settings of town and guild halls, where they continued to be donated and displayed until the seventeenth century. This panel, of the highest quality, can be closely connected with the early work of the Zurich glass painter Lukas Zeiner, who flourished between about 1480 and the second decade of the sixteenth century. The Museum is especially fortunate in its holdings of Zeiner's work: in addition to the two following panels (plates 52-3), there are two further panels with shields of arms supported by single angels (81 and 82-1865). The present panel has been restored in the lower part with fragments of old glass with diapering of a different pattern, but it is otherwise in excellent condition.\nH.
