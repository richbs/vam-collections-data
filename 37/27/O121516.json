In this technique the motifs are delineated in wire or metal bands which enclose coloured enamels. Here it includes pine trees, cranes, a mythical Ho-o bird, butterflies and floral motifs including chrysanthemums. The rims, handles and feet all have areas of gilded copper. \n\nStylistically this ewer is most likely to have been produced in Nagoya around 1880. In 1871 the Nagoya Cloisonn\u00e9 Company (Nagoya Shippo Kaisha) was established at the nearby village of Toshima. The technological advances made by this company resulted in their winning a first prize at the Vienna Exhibition of 1873. So many cloisonn\u00e9-manufacturing  companies sprang up in and around Toshima that the area came to be known as Shippo-mura (\u2018cloisonn\u00e9 village\u2019) or Shippo-cho (\u2018cloisonn\u00e9 town\u2019). It rapidly became Japan\u2019s main centre of cloisonn\u00e9 production. At their peak the cloisonn\u00e9 manufacturers of Toshima were producing no less than 70% of the total cloisonn\u00e9 enamels produced in Japan.",
