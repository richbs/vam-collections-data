A painter of this name is recorded as having died in Bayreth in 1761.\nThe fact that this dish bears a mark unknown in use at Bayreuth (CP) makes it attribution to this place problematic. The type of pale figurative decoration on a very visible white ground is also not characteristic of Bayreuth wares. However, it is known that a painter by name of Johann Heinrich Steinbach died at Bayreuth in 1761.\n'CP' was used at Sulzbach in Bavaria for 'Chur-Pfalz', the local name for that Pfalz (the Upper Palatinate). Several objects bearing a CP mark survive and are in the Mannheim museum. However, it is not known that Steinbach worked there and to date no other ceramic has appeared with his name on it.\nSulzbach and Bavaria are close together and it is not impossible that Steinbach worked in both places.",
