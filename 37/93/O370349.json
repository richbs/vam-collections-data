            "physical_description": "A small spherical flask in carved boxwood, with a stopper in the shaped of an African male turbanned head. The flask is carved in relief with four almost identical Renaissance-style masks with foliage and deep-cut eyes coloured black.  A tiny cavity in each mouth appears to have been stopped with a filler which has blackened with age. The masks are divided by vertical bands of ornament, with leaf pendants between parallel lines. The background is punched to create a matt texture in contrast to the polished wood of the masks. The neck of the flask has bands of carved ornament. A circular hole in the bottom of the flask has been plugged with a plaster-like material. The neck of the flask is fitted with a later wood plug, pierced in the centre to take a later wood tenon in the stopper.\n\nThe stopper is carved in the form of the head of a young male of African descent, wearing a turban, with hair showing at the sides and back. The eyes sockets are fitted with tiny white glass eyes with black pupils, and the ears have been drilled; they were perhaps once fitted with beads.  There is a patch of shellac filler on one side of the turban which might conceal a further drilled hole. The mouth and the folds of the turban are cut in straight lines possibly using a small saw. Inside the ears it is possible to detect a brown outer layer and white inner filling.  The head does not appear to be made of wood as there is no visible grain, but could be a mineral substance.  There are dark cracks across the face and a brass collar has been fitted to the neck, possibly a later addition, to hold the stopper together.",
