At the back, round the edge, is a raised band of fretted and gilt fleurettes and this is repeated, in reverse, round the central pad; between them is a raised band connecting four cartouches all carrying inscriptions; on each side of this band are arranged groups of floral motifs gilded on to the surface of the steel. \n\nThe inscriptions on the reverse are in Persian praising Maharao Ram Singh (possibly Ram Singh of Kotah (1828-66). The front is inscribed in Urdu couplets with Devanagari transliterations between them (these are partly obliterated). These form a concentric circle from which, in one place, radiates towards the centre two lines of Devanagari containing names of which 'Shri Madhu' (possibly Madhu Sudan, an epithet of Krishna) and 'Shri Baldevji Sahay' remain. Below this is '?...t danda Shaikh ilah'(?), possibly the name of the maker.",
