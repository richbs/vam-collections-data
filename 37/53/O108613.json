He was one of many variety performers whose acts were popular on tour in the 1920s and 1930s but about whom little is remembered today.\n\nBorn in Bombay in the late 19th century,  Manek Shah studied medicine and qualified in India as a doctor.  He went to the United States where he was naturalised as an American citizen in California in 1906, and despite his medical training, worked as a stage illusionist. He appeared professionally in vaudeville in the United States and in variety in England in the 1920s and 1930s with two assistants, including his daughter Retta Shah.  He adopted various billings including 'Yuga, Mystical Entertainer Extraordinary; 'Yuga & Co.', 'Prince Yuga & Co.' and 'Prince Yuga and his Company of Oriental Mystic Entertainers.'   He made his oriental appearance his trade-mark and specialised in illusions including the Indian rope trick, passing a cord through his neck, producing birds from empty vessels, and making an assistant disappear from a crate.",

He appeared professionally in Variety Theatres in England in the 1920s and 1930s with two assistants, including his daughter Retta Shah, under various billings including 'Yuga, Mystical Entertainer Extraordinary; 'Yuga & Co.', 'Prince Yuga & Co.' and 'Prince Yuga and his Company of Oriental Mystic Entertainers.'  Some of the advertisements and fliers in the associated archive show him billed as 'Yugo, the famous Oriental Mystic Entertainer' and 'Yoga, India's Foremost Mystic Entertainer.'  In 1922 in England he appeared in Maskelynes' magical entertainments at St. George's Hall performing tricks including the Indian rope trick and another in which he appeared to pass a cord through his neck. He made his oriental appearance his trade-mark and specialised in illusions such as producing birds from empty vessels and making an assistant disappear from a crate.\n\nPrince Yuga was a magician who specialised in an illusionist act which he enhanced for the public with his exotic appearance and name.  Nevertheless he was one of many similar performers whose acts were popular on tour in the 1920s and 1930s but about which little remains.",
