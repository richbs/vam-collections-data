The ribs are both decorative and functional, providing the circular sheet with extra strength to avoid buckling.  The impression of flat, overlapping leaves has led to the tray being referred to as the 'lily pad'.\n\nPeople\nWilliam Arthur Smith Benson (1854-1924) was educated at Eton and Oxford and trained in the office of the architect, Basil Champneys.  Through his friendship with Edward Burne Jones, he was introduced to William Morris who encouraged him to set up his own metal workshop in 1880.  In 1882, he established a foundry in Hammersmith and in about 1887, a shop in Bond Street.  Benson was a founder member of the Art Workers' Guild, established in 1884. Following the death of William Morris in 1896, he became Managing Director of Morris & Co. (for whom he also designed furniture and wallpaper).  Benson's own  firm prospered but during the First World War, the factory was entirely converted to producing material for the war effort, manufacturing amongst other instruments, altimeters for the Sopwith Camel.  By the cessation of hostilities in 1918, Benson had become rather discouraged and he closed the factory upon his retirement in 1920.  He died in 1924.\n\nDesign & Designing\nBenson was admired for the simplicity and clarity of his designs which made little use of extraneous ornament.  He also designed for machine production, openly admiring and exploiting its potential.",
