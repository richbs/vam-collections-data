It forms part of a demi-parure - a half set of jewels - which includes a pair of  long earrings of pendoloque type (long pear-shaped pendants beneath bows).  Gone are the freedom of design and sometimes asymmetry of the mid-eighteenth century jewels influenced by the rococo.\n\nThe effect is of brilliance and light.  The stones are white and set in silver to enhance their whiteness.  They might have been diamonds, but, if they had been, they would probably have been reset into new fashions many times since.  This set of jewels owes its survival to the fact that the stones are white topaz.",

It forms part of a demi-parure - a half set of jewels - which also includes a pair of  long earrings of pendoloque type centred by bows. Gone are the naturalism and sometimes asymmetry of the mid eighteenth jewels influenced by the rococo.\n\nThe effect is of brilliance and light.  The stones are white and set in silver to enhance their whiteness.  They are cut like brilliant-cut diamonds and might have been diamonds, but, if they had been, they would probably have been reset into new fashions many times since.  This set of jewels owes its survival to the fact that the stones are white topaz.",
