Inscription (verso): No. ; Inscription (verso of mount): (X614-)184  293 x 228 mm  PH 310-1947 Literature: Microfilm: 3.18.42 (or 142?) The possibility that Lady Hawarden photographed the members of the amateur troupe who played the farce 'The Port Admiral' at the Female School of Art fete in June 1864 is further supported by the appearance of the young man in this photograph. Comparison of his costume with the outfit of the villain shown in the Illustrated London News engraving [see ILN, 14 July 1863] shows that they are substantially the same. Although the man in the newspaper illustration is wearing black boots, London Society reported that the 'heavy villain' wore 'a fine, laced coat and ample, yellow boots'. [C.L.E., 'The Fancy Fair at Kensington', London Society 4:108 (August 1863). This and the ILN engraving report on an earlier production.]'",
