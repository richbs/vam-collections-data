            "public_access_description": "The technique of machine-knotting carpet pile seems to have been developed by Renard Freres in Nonancourt, France. The firm was established in 1880 and apparently began production of machine-knotted carpets almost immediately. Their 'knot-stitch' carpets were produced until World War II, or perhaps a little later. Tompkinsons Ltd. of Kidderminster, England were among several firms to acquire similar looms and they were producing machine-knotted carpets, which they called 'patent knot stitch seamless squares' from about 1921 until the 1950s, by which time production costs had made them uneconomic. While Renard Freres probably concentrated on 'oriental' designs, Tomkinson included designs by contemporary British artists. \n\nNo machine-knotted carpets were originally sold as hand-knotted, but it was only a matter of time before they began to pass from owner to owner and to be misidentified.\nThe only way we have found to identify machine-knotting is to look very closely at the direction of the thread in the back of each knot. Like hand-tied knots, each one forms two 'bumps' as it passes around two warp threads. Frequently, but not always, the thread in one 'bump' of a machine-knotted carpet is horizontal and the next 'bump' of the same knot is pulled into a marked diagonal.",
