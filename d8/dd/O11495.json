Egg cups came singly or, rather more grandly, in sets of six or more, held in a circular stand.  A reversible shape, as used in this very modest example, was common.  The transfer print here has been hurriedly and inexpertly applied.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe Willow Pattern is probably the best-known and most enduring of ceramic patterns.  It was engraved by Thomas Minton (1766-1836)  for Thomas Turner at Caughley, where it was first introduced in about 1780. There are many different versions of the pattern, the more familiar of which date from the early 19th century. The story of a pair of lovers escaping over a bridge from an irate parent ,which is now attached to the scene, was invented in about 1900. The pattern was used by virtually every one of the major factories and also by many of the smaller ones.",
