The most enduring method in Britain is done by hand, and is known as 'piecing over paper'. The pattern is first drawn onto paper and then accurately cut. Small pieces of fabric are tacked round each of the shapes, and then joined together from the back using overstitch. Geometric shapes produce some of the most striking examples. \n\nHand-quilting is done on a frame using needles called 'betweens'. The stitches are executed with one hand; the other hand is kept underneath the quilt to feel for the needle. Small, uniform stitches (usually a 'running stitch') are taken through the three layers to form a decorative design.\n\nAt the time this quilted bedcover was created, the British textile industry was producing a great variety of printed cottons in different qualities, available at different prices. Textile designs were developed with an emphasis on novelty, such as the four large leopard skin squares in the corners.",

The repeal of the Excise Duty in 1831 made most goods for home consumption 30\u201340 per cent cheaper. Radical new textile designs were developed, with the emphasis placed on \u2018novelty\u2019 \u2013 such as the four large square pieces of printed cotton resembling patches of fur seen here. Such designs were popular throughout the 1830s. The wider availability of cottons had an impact on the creation of patchwork by both the working and middle classes. In the novel Sylvia\u2019s Lovers (1863) Elizabeth Gaskell describes the domestic arrangements in a retired farmhouse in the North of England, where: \n\n'the united efforts of some former generation of the family had produced patchwork curtains and coverlet; and patchwork was patchwork in those days, before the early Yates and Peels [textile manufacturers] had found out the secret of printing the parsley-leaf. Scraps of costly Indian chintzes and palempours were intermixed with commoner black and red calico in minute hexagons; and the variety of patterns served for the useful purpose of promoting conversations as well as the more obvious one of displaying the workwoman\u2019s taste.'",
