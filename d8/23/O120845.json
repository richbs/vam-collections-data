This coincided with the increased use of candlesticks on the altar (either singly or, more usually, in pairs) during the Mass, which seems to have been standard practice by the early 1200s.   They are illustrated standing on altars on many of the reliquary caskets produced at Limoges (eg V&A, 4041-1856). The main decorative features of this V&A candlestick can be found in other surviving examples.\n\nLimoges candlesticks were commonly exported. A thirteenth-century inventory of St Paul\u2019s cathedral, London, describes a pair of candlesticks \u2018of Limoges workmanship'. Similarly-shaped candlesticks of a larger scale were used in processions, or held by priestly assistants \u2013 the central knop on the shaft provided a useful grip.",

This coincided with their increased use on the altar, either singly or (more usually) in pairs.  In the 9th century, Pope Leo IV had specifically forbidden their use at the Council of Rheims, but Pope Innocent III (pope from 1198 to 1216) referred to paired candlesticks on the corners of the altar in his text <font -i>De Sacro altaris mysterio</font -u> - apparently indicating that this was standard practice by the early 13th century.   They are also illustrated standing on altars on many of the reliquary chasses produced at Limoges (eg panel from a chasse, V&A, 4041-1856).  \n\nSimilar shaped candlesticks, though of a larger scale, were used in processions, or held by acolytes (cf fig.450, E. Rupin, <font -u>L'oeuvre de Limoges</font -u>, Paris, 1890, chasse from church of Banise (Creuse), France) \u2013 the central knop on the shaft provided a useful grip.\n\nLimoges candlesticks appear in documentary records: the chronicles of Saint-Martial of Limoges describe a pair of enamelled candlesticks in 1208.  They were also commonly exported (eg a 13th century inventory of St Paul\u2019s cathedral, London, describes a pair of candlesticks \u2018de opera lemovicensi\u2019 [of Limoges workmanship].\n\nThere is often some uncertainty as to whether so-called Limoges enamels were produced actually at Limoges or nearby (sometimes even over the border in Spain).  But the use of white dots on a blue background (as seen around the dragons on the base here) seems to be a particular Limousin hallmark.\n\nThe main features of this V&A candlestick can be found in other surviving examples:\nTriangular base, with similar feet and beast decoration \u2013 cat. 33, <font -u>Enamels of Limoges 1100-1350</font -u>, Metropolitan Museum of Art exhib. cat., 1996 \nShaft with scale decoration \u2013 eg cat.37, <font -u>Enamels of Limoges 1100-1350</font -u>, Metropolitan Museum of Art exhib. cat., 1996\nSimilar proportions, with single central knop \u2013 V&A, M.579-1910",
