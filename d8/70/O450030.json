This gave the horse greater speed and the rider greater flexibility in the saddle. The stirrups were designed so the rider could partially stand up with confidence and get the seat clear of the saddle. This enabled the use of weapons such as the bow, javelins, swords, and later, firearms. In Europe this riding style became known as la jineta after the Moorish light cavalry that used it. \n\nThe stirrup platforms in some cases evolved into large, rectangular platforms. Instructions to the horse's flanks were transmitted using the corners with movements of the rider's heel rather than spurs.",
