This statuette, by a medallist who also worked in other materials, is based on an antique prototype, The Spinario ('one who removes a thorn'). The naturalistic plants and animals were added by Weiditz. \nThe statuette could have been intended for a cabinet of curiosities. Perhaps it was even a male pendant to the Cleopatra now in Nuremberg.\n\nWeiditz (c. 1500 \u2013 1559) was a medallist, sculptor and goldsmith, active in Strasbourg and South Germany. He travelled to Spain in 1529 in the retinue of Emperor Charles V, and again formed part of the Imperial Court\u2019s visit to the Rhineland and the Netherlands in 1530-1. He probably went to Saxony in 1537 and 1539, and may have additionally journeyed to England. His work as a portrait medallist is characterized by a naturalistic style; he also practised as a small-scale sculptor.",

Hildburgh FSA from Ferdinand Knapp, Berlin, on 3 March, 1931; perhaps previously in a Russian private collection; given by Dr Hildburgh to the Museum in 1949; formerly on loan from Dr Hildburgh to the Museum. Although Ferdinand Knapp, the dealer in Berlin from whom Dr Hildburgh, the donor, bought this ivory in 1931, has claimed it came from the collection in the Hermitage at St Petersburg, this has subsequently been shown to be false (I am grateful to V. Kryjanovscayja, curator of medieval art at the Hermitage, for clarifying this).\n\nHistorical significance: The pose of the body, though not the head, is based on the antique Spinario, which Weidtiz could have known through a later bronze statuette (cf. Haskell and Penny 1981, pp. 308-10). The head which is more naturalistic than that seen on the antique prototype, could be based on a life study. It is interesting to compare Rubens\u2019s slightly later treatment of the same classical source, in a chalk drawing of the early seventeenth century, where the head was also freely adapted, and almost certainly taken from life (Rowlands 1977, cat. no. 14).",
