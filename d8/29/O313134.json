This statuette is recorded as part of the collection of Dr Stevens in Antwerp in 1860. Originally the figure stood on a sphere on an elaborately carved base. It is made by Michel Mollart in Dieppe in 1675. A native of Dieppe, Mollart was a sculptor and medallist, active in Paris from 1684 to 1703, before returning to Dieppe. His medals were often based on others' models. From 1691 to 1697 he made inscriptions for the bronze medals for the Acad\u00e9mie Royale for the Grande Histoire of Louis XIV.",
