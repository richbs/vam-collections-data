(quoted in Syed Mahmudul Hasan, 1979, p.135). Hasan  assumes these architectural pieces to be those now in the V&A  Museum and that they came from the ruined mosque of Firuz  Shah II which stands close to the abandoned indigo factory at  Goamalti in the south-west part of English Bazar in the District  of Malda, which was the British settlement established between  the cities of Gaur and Pandua.",
