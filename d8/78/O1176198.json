The set replaced china that had been in use since the launch of the Pendolino service in 2004, the Dudson design providing \"better utilisation [that] will mean that the total number of pieces in each individual set will reduce from nine to five.\" The press releases also quoted Nic Cuthbertson, Virgin Trains' Product Development and Purchasing Manager as saying: \"We have been impressed by Dudson's professionalism in understanding our requirements and converting our ideas to something real and workable.
