He subsequently went to D\u00fcsseldorf at an unknown date and became a pupil of Carl Ferdinand Sohn (1805-1867) while also taking lessons with Rudolf Jordan (1810-1887). He later made several trips to Italy, France and Germany. He died in D\u00fcsseldorf in 1877.\n\nThis painting is a fine example of Schwer's output. It was probably made during a study trip to Willingshausen in the Schwalm (central Germany) he undertook in 1860. This painting shows a young girl gathering sticks in a typical German costume and silhouetted against a dark atmospheric landscape, reminiscent of the art of Sohn. This painting is a good example of the late Romanticism imagery developed in D\u00fcsseldorf in the second half of the 19th century.",

Girls gathering sticks. By G. Schwer. Signed. German. Dated 1860'; bequeathed by Rev. Chauncey Hare Townshend, 1868.\n\nHistorical significance: The museum owns another painting of this period, <i> Travelling dog cart</i>(1610-1869) which also documented the rustic life of the people of the Schwalm. Cahrcteristic of Schwer'art is the high degree of finish and relatively dark palette. This painting and the other one are two rare example of Schwer's oeuvre preserved in the UK.\nThis work was probably brought by the Rev. Townshend directly from the artist and displayed in his villa in Lausanne where it completed a large collection of 19th-century paintings.",

            "historical_context_note": "The word Romanticism derived from the medieval term 'romance' and was first used by the German poets and critics August Wilhelm and Friedrich Schlegel to label a wider cultural movement beginning with the late 18th and ending towards the mid 19th century. Romanticism started first in Western Europe as a literary and philosophical movement and only gradually involved the other arts, explicitly around 1800. Romantic artists were fascinated by nature they interpreted as a mirror of the mind. They investigated human nature and personality, the folk culture, the national and ethnic origins, the medieval era, the exotic, the remote, the mysterious and the occult. The interest in the exotic and the non-Western, illustrated in France by such a painter as Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix (1798-1863), as well as the medieval revival, witnessed in England by Horace Walpole (1717-1797), are perhaps the most identifiable parts of Romanticism. It is really in the Post-Napoleonic period that this movement gained ascendancy. Its greatest proponents were among others Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault (1791-1824) and Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 de Chateaubriant (1768-1848) in France, Joseph Mallord William Turner (1775-1851) in England, Heinrich Heine (1797-1856) and Caspar David Friedrich (1774-1840) in Germany. In the visual arts, it was largely played out by 1850, but in music it persists for another generation.",
