Le Dent is seen standing on stage in his costume consisting of a suit, white gloves and spats, a top hat and a flower in his buttonhole, surrounded by objects he juggled, but since there is no orchestra or audience, the shot was clearly set up specifically for the photograph. To his right there is a hat stand with five top hats that would have been part of his 'Bouncing Hats' routine, while the bust to the left of Le Dent wears another top hat.\n\nThe photograph is backed with a printed Date Sheet produced by the H.W. Wieland Agency, inscribed in ink with a selection of Le Dent's bookings from January 1912 to October 1918 including dates in Canada, The USA, the UK, Africa, and Australia.\n\nThe photograph was taken by Hana Studios in London, a business started by George Henry Hana (1868-1938)  who emigrated to the United States of America as a young man where he worked in Chicago at Scholl's Studio, a business specialising in theatrical photography. He moved to New York before settling in London in 1893 and opening the Hana Studios in Bedford Street in Covent Garden in 1897.",
