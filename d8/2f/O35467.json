Head made of composition painted white with red patches on the cheeks, around ears, on nose and above eyes as well as mouth. Eyes painted green and black. Blue spots used as face decoration. Large shoe shaped feet made of composition painted black. The character wears a black cloth tailed coat; black and white plaid trousers; red and white striped bow tie; waistcoat of yellow felt with red felt 'buttons' and a collar and back of white cloth. Large hands shaped and decorated with three black lines to represent gloves.  The hair is thick strands of orange wool glued to the head. Because of the colouring and type of hair it looks more like the 1970s version than that of the 1980s.\nParts - head with socket neck; flat sided half dome unpainted wood body with a separate unpainted wood lower torso; two plain dowel sticks for arms attached to hands and two dowel sticks for the legs. Parts strung together. Stringing of multicoloured threads - two metal loops on the head; two metal loops on the body; one through each hand; one through each foot. Controls; two plain bars of wood linked by a large metal clip with two metal eyelets each surrounded by coloured plastic caps. Stamped PELHAM PUPPET MADE IN ENGLAND on the top which has a large metal hanging hook. In 1984 this puppet cost \u00a36.70.",
