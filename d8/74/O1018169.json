A. L. Egg placed the \nfigure</i> \nBlack and red chalk. 34 x 55.5 cm \nVAM 6586 \n \nOn 11 November 1857 Richard Redgrave \ncommented in his diary \u2018I believe Mulready is \nseventy-three, and yet there he is, hard at work \nat the \u2018Life\u2019, like any young student. He is not \nonly attending as Visitor, and drawing at the \nRoyal Academy, but he is one of a party who \nmeet three times a week at Ansdell\u2019s for \nstudying from the life\u2019. The Victoria and  \nAlbert Museum possesses nearly a hundred of \nhis studies of nudes ranging in date from 1805 \nto 1862. They do not relate to specific paint- \nings but are rather an entity in themselves. \nThey were exhibited as a whole at Gore House \nin 1853 where Queen Victoria was much im- \npressed by them. \n(VAM, A.
