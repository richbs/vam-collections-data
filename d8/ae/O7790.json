Their design was based upon the simple weight-driven iron clocks made on the Continent.  The name 'lantern' is probably based on the word 'laton' - meaning brass - as most of them had brass cases.   These clocks were always driven by weights.  They were made either to stand on a bracket or to hang on the wall from a stirrup on the back plate.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThis is the only known lantern clock with a silver case.  The dial plate, chapter ring, alarm disc, side doors and pierced silver gallery are all of silver.  It must have been made as a special commission for a wealthy patron.  \n\nPeople\nDavid Bouquet was a French immigrant who was admitted to the Blacksmiths' Company in 1628.  He joined the Clockmakers' Company as a founder member in 1632.",
