Many such snuff-rasps in ivory were carved in Dieppe; a collection of analogous pieces is also in the Louvre. At the back, a swivel cover reveals a small cavity where tobacco or snuff could be stored. This piece shows dress which is a slightly fanciful European interpretation of Turkish costume, which became popular in France and Britain in the 18th century. A snuff rasp was used like a nutmeg grater for grating dried tobacco into snuff. The inner side of the figure houses the perforated metal section for grating the snuff.\n\nSnuff taking was a popular pastime in France for the wealthy and fashionable. It was thought by some that a regular dose of snuff could protect against the plague. The tobacco was grated from a solid tobacco roll known as a 'carotte'.",
