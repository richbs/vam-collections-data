Cook directed the transportation up the Nile of the abortive British expedition to relieve General Gordon in Khartoum. Although the album itself is dated 1885 on the dedication page, it contains drawings dated 1875, 1882, and 1885, 1886 and 1887. For information on the subject matter of the drawings, see E.W.
