In its ebonised finish and turned decoration, it illustrates the influence of the Art Movement of the 1870s, in particular Norman Shaw's 'Old English' style. The chair would have fitted well into the largely Gothic interiors of the house. \n\nLord Selborne started professional life as a lawyer. He was made a peer in 1861. It is possible that he chose to build and furnish Blackmoor House in a neo-medieval style to suggest a long-established family history.",
