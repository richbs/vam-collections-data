Vardy, the first architect employed by John Spencer to work on the house, drew the external elevations and also designed the ground floor rooms and some of the furniture. The design for this table survives, unsigned, in the collection of the British Museum. This table is thought to have been carved by Thomas Vardy, John's brother. The table and its pair stood in the centre of the ends of the dining room, behind an ionic screen. They were surmounted by oval mirrors while massive silver wine coolers were probably stored below.\n\nThe table is now once more on show at Spencer House.
