A variation of this instrument, known as the philomele, evolved by about 1890 and was played against the shoulder like a violin.  This example was made by Max Amberger (1838 - 1889) of Munich, who made stringed instruments, expecially guitars and their variants. This instrument was shown at the Paris exhibition of 1867 and bought by this museum shortly afterwards.",
