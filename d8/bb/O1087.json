Classical Greece was the most revered of ancient periods and, provided inspiration for many art forms. Companies such as that of J. F. Christy, whose speciality was painted decoration, looked to Greek 'red-figure' ceramics for ideas.\n\nDesign & Designing\nClassical Greece pre-dates the invention of blown glass: what little glass is believed to have been made by the ancient Greeks consists of small cast objects or tiny flasks and bottles made of molten glass wound around a core of clay or other organic material.  Since 19th-century glassmakers therefore had no ancient Greek examples to refer to, some glassmakers seeking to work in a classical style  used wheel-engraved decoration on Greek-style pottery shapes. Here J. F. Christy has chosen the simplest, handle-less shape but seeks to imitate the ware itself with black glass and painting in red enamel. The source has not been identified for the image of a man, not quite a satyr with a tail only, holding the bridle of a rearing ass. In 1849 the company was given an award by the Society of Arts for 'specimens of enamelled glass' .",
