Sk\u00e5ne province, in the extreme south of Sweden, has the richest tradition, and more jewellery was worn there than in any other district.   Almost all the Swedish traditional jewellery at the V&A comes from Sk\u00e5ne.  \n\nWhen Sweden became Protestant in 1527, Swedish women continued to wear crosses rich with symbolism and religious pendants like their medieval predecessors.  The most typical Swedish cross is the tau (T-shaped) cross, also called the cross of St Anthony, from Sk\u00e5ne.  Sweden is the only country which has tau crosses among its traditional jewellery.\n\nThe oldest tau crosses were made from solid metal.  In the late 18th century the silversmiths of Sk\u00e5ne started to experiment with new styles and methods of manufacture.  The glass stones on this cross were originally set over red foil, but the colour has now completely vanished.  Many pieces of Swedish traditional jewellery use the renaissance motif of an angel's head with wings. \n\nThis cross is marked with the Swedish 'cat's paw' silver mark, the circular town mark of Karlshamn, and the maker's mark NB.  Niclas Bleckberg the elder was a silversmith who specialised in making traditional jewellery in Karlshamn, from before 1799 to 1806.",
