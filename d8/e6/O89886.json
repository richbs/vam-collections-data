The main border is of a plain ivory colour with applied strips of greyish-green paper at its three outer margins and a beige-coloured stripof woven textile on the inner left hand margin added as a gutter for the present album binding.

It contains 56 leaves on which are Mughal miniature paintings, drawing and flower studies on both sides. The binding is covered with an Indian brocade silk that may have been cut from lengths brought home by the 2nd Lord Clive, who served as Governor of Madras, 1799 to 1803.  The album was sold from Powis Castle at Sotheby's sale, 16 to 18 January 1956, lot 332A.",
