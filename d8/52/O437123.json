One side is decorated with a naval scene taken from the 'Battle' of the Saints' between British and French ships, while the other side illustrates an outdoor scene of two oversized women in a park beside a large building. The naval battle occurred off the Iies des Saintes, a group of islands south of Guadeloupe in the eastern Caribbean, between 9th and 12th of April 1782, during the American War of Independence. The British fleet was commanded by Admiral Sir George Brydges Rodney who prevented, and gained victory over the larger Spanish and French fleets as they sought to invade Jamaica. The naval success is deemed an important moment in British political history and various ceramics vessels and figurines were made to commemorate the event. One of the ships identified on this bowl is the HMS St Albans commanded by Captain Charles Inglis. The piece was perhaps commissioned by his brother, a director of the East India Company, to commemorate his brother's leadership in the battle.",
