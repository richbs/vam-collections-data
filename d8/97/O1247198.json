Mrs Stratton whose London premises were located at 104, Piccadilly, was commissioned to make the Princess's bridal dress and several other garments for her trousseau. This was a very prestigious commission which confirmed her position as one of London's leading court dressmakers.\n\nPrincess Beatrice (1857-1944) was Queen Victoria's youngest daughter. She married Prince Henry of Battenberg (1858-1896)  on 23 July 1885 at Whippingham Church, Osborne, in the Isle of Wight.",

Princess Beatrice Mary Victoria Feodore (1857-1944), the youngest daughter of Queen Victoria, who married Prince Henry of Battenberg (1858-1896) on 23 July 1885 at Whippingham Church, Osborne, Isle of Wight. The cuttings were preserved, and presumably taken, by Mrs Caroline Augusta Gammack (1852-1916) who worked as a stock keeper for Mrs Stratton. \n\nThese fabrics may have been used to make a dinner dress decribed in an article in <i>The Graphic</i>. 'The Princess Beatrice's Trousseau', 27 July 1885, 'Most bridal like of dinner-dresses was one of white brocaded <i>cr\u00eape</i> over satin; on the side panels was an <i>appliqu\u00e9</i> of pearl picotees and leaves; on the edges a thick pearl fringe; bodice of satin, a pearl stomacher, and tulle draperies; elbow-sleeves, trimmed to correspond'.\n\n<i>The Dundee Courier and Argus</i>, 'The Beatrice Marriage The Wedding Prepartions', 11 July 1885, also described this dress. 'One of the evening dresses is made of pure white <i>broch\u00e9 cr\u00eape de chine</i> over a white satin petticoat. The top skirt is edged with pendants made of pearl and gold beads, and opens at the left-hand side to display a panel formed of rows of similar pearls and gold fringe. A reyers (sic) of white satin borders each side of this tablier, embroidered in pearl with large sprays of carnations. The bodice is cut round, and has elbow sleeves, the neck being finished off with a tulle bertha.'",
