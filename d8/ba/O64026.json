Examples of movement have included weaving with highly twisted yarns which crinkle up when immersed in hot water, weaving with stainless steel yarns which give the textile a sculptural quality and looking at creating literal movement with the yarns within the composition of a textile.  The inspiration for the wandering threads of this delicate design came from the patterns found within histology images in 'Wheatear's Functional Histology: A Text and Colour Atlas', published 1979. As well as exploring this movement of wandering lines, I decided to work with phosphorescent yarns in order to charge the textiles with a glowing light.  In this way the textile transforms when shown in the dark.\n\nAnother version of this textile is on display in the 'Glass Aquarium' exhibition at the Two Ten Gallery, The Wellcome Trust, 210 Euston Road, London.\n\nHistorical significance: Sophie Roet is one of a small band of contemporary British designers and weavers producing light sensitive textiles.
