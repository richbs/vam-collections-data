The skirt is made of a yellow twill damask with self patterned clouds and bats. Light blue silk plain weave lining. Decoration is concentrated across the lower edge of the skirt, which remains the only visible era under the calf-length upper garment that would have been worn with it. The two main, straight, densely-embroidered panel are heavily embroidered with butterflies and flowers ( prunus, peony) in different shades of blue and white. These front-panels are heavily trimmed with a narrow black satin band, a wider black satin band embroidered with  flowers and butterflies in different shades of blue and white floss silks in satin stitch and details embroidered in gold thread in couched work. and a narrow black satin band also embroidered with  a frieze of prunus flowers in shades of blue. The other pleated panel are embroidered either with a single narcissus or an orchid and are trimmed with a plain black satin band and a black satin band embroidered with a frieze of prunus in different shades of blue. When the skirt is worn, wrap-around style, both  the decorated straight panels are at back and front, with the pleats flaring out at the sides. The twill damask is rather from an inferior quality( very loose and flimsy.) There is a clear quality difference between the embroideries on the two front-panels and  the pleated panel ( the later are very flimsy, made of flossy floss silks)",
