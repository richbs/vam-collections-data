His business survived the war, and the period of post-war recovery. During the first half-decade of his house's existence, when continuing restrictions on materials and shifting client fortunes might have threatened his young business, Dess\u00e8s found success. His career-long preoccupation with draping and form resulted in gowns such as this blue chiffon evening dress: defined by their femininity, technical complexity and use of sheer fabrics. \n\nIn his early designs, Dess\u00e8s's evening wear is characterised by a subtle colour palette of creams, beiges and pale pinks, but he later introduced vibrant colours such as the varied blue shades seen in this dress of 1951. The luxurious textiles and skilled construction of this dress suggest the high level of craftsmanship that French couture houses achieved within a few years of the war's end.",
