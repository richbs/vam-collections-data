The scenes on the cover and emblems of the Passion indicate that Samson's trials prefigured those of Christ.  The cover depicts Samson, the fox and grain, a reference to Samson burning the fields of the Philistines; Samson slaying the lion; Samson carrying the gates of Gaza, and Samson tearing down the pillars of the temple.  The underside of the cover is painted in gold 'en camaieu' with the marriage feast of Samson, and Samson slaying the Philistines with the jawbone of an ass.",

It was owned by the writer and collector Horace Walpole (1717-97) and displayed at Strawberry Hill, his house in Twickenham.  After the sale of his collection in 1842, it was bought by William Beckford (1760-1844) and by descent, entered the collection of the Dukes of Hamilton.\nThis piece is decorated with scenes from the life of Samson as described in the Book of Judges in the Bible.  The use of the Samson story on Limoges painted enamels is relatively rare and this example is particularly finely painted by Jean P\u00e9nicaud II (active 1534-49).\nProbably one of the sons of the enameller Nardon  P\u00e9nicaud and nephew to Jean P\u00e9nicaud I, Jean P\u00e9nicaud II was the leading exponent in Limoges of a Renaissance style based on the Italian Mannerism of the Fontainebleau School.  He excelled in both grisaille and polychrome painted enamels, though he showed a preference for grisaille work and his extant polychrome works are rare. He created both ecclesiastical and secular work and is especially known for his reliquaries and portraits such as the medallion of Pope Clement VII (Paris, Louvre inv.OA 1000). His signed and dated works are few but his style is recognisable especially in his fine representation of faces and use of subtle flesh tones.  This tazza can be firmly attributed to Jean II Penicaud even though the inscription on the foot bearing his name and the date is probably part of a nineteenth-century restoration.",
