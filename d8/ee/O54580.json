His eyes have painted blue pupils flecked with white and he wears light black hand-stitched wool trousers with a slight stripe, suggesting cord, tied below the knees with white cotton tape.  The trousers have a brown cotton edge at the top for drawstring; and he wears an ochre scarf, possibly rayon ca.1950s, and a white cotton smock with hand smocking suggesting that this was an original garment.\n\nHis right hand is shaped to hold a prop while his right hand is open for gesture. He has a solidly stuffed calico body and an oval wooden yoke (with hollow to take the neck joint) and pelvis.  The legs are attached by leather loops, and the upper leg enters into the shaped part of the lower leg. There are large staples set in slots for the ankle joints.\n\nControl bars.   There is a string to the backside, not between the shoulders.",

Marionette shows were a popular form of entertainment for adults in the 19th century, many of them family concerns which travelled around the country long before the advent of film and television, presenting shortened versions of London's latest popular entertainment from melodramas and pantomimes to minstrel shows and music hall. In the 18th and early 19th centuries their theatres were relatively makeshift, but after about 1860 many became quite elaborate, with walls constructed from wooden shutters, seating made from tiered planks of wood, and canvas roofs.\n\nThe figures were carved, painted, dressed and performed by members of the company.  This is Tim Bobbin, the slow-witted Lancashire country bumpkin who, despite his stupidity, often displayed native cunning. The original Tim Bobbin appeared in a book written by John Collier in the mid-18th century. By the middle of the 19th century he regularly featured in marionette troupes and their plays.",

They began working on recreating some of the puppets' original repertoire. Since the original cloths were too fragile for performance, new backdrops were painted, and in August 1951 as part of The Festival of Britain celebrations, the marionettes took to the stage again as The Old Time Marionettes, at the Riverside Theatre, Festival Gardens, Battersea Park. A photograph in thje collection, S.1120-2010, shows George Speight holding this marionette. In the 1980s George Speaight lent the troupe to puppeteers  in Germany but in the late 1990s he sold them to John Phillips, an expert puppet carver, manipulator and puppet historian, whose widow sold them to the Museum after his death in 1998.",

            "production_note": "It is impossible to identify the precise maker of this marionette since the company made, altered and used figures throughout its career.  It is possible, however, to distinguish distinct types, and therefore groups, made by different makers, due to the type of carving.  The carver of this object has been distinguished as Maker B because of its standard-sized head.",
