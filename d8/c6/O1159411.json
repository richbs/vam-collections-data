Circa mid 19th century. \n\nThis appears to be part of a series of prints entitled 'Galerie Dramatique' and is associated with the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Ga\u00eet\u00e9. \n\nThis theatre opened in 1792 and its company, previously Danseurs de la Roi, were renamed Danseurs de la Ga\u00eet\u00e9. It was rebuilt in 1808 and again in 1835, each time on the same site. The theatre closed permanently in 1989.\n\nThe title Stella may refer to a ballet, also known as The Smugglers, which was choreographed by Arthur Saint-Leon and had music by Cesare Pugni. This ballet was first performed at the Op\u00e9ra de Paris on 22nd February 1850 . \n\n It is part of the Harry Beard Collection",
