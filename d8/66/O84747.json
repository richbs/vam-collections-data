A strip of beige woven textile has been added along the left hand side to act as a gutter for the album binding. The edges of the page have been gilded.",

It contains 56 leaves on which are Mughal miniature paintings, drawing and flower studies on both sides. The binding is covered with an Indian brocade.  This silk may have been cut from lengths brought home by the 2nd Lord Clive, who served as Governor of Madras, 1799 to 1803.
