Most photographs in the series are taken in his house (now a museum) in Hammarby near Uppsala, Sweden. Linnaeus furnished his home as a kind of personal museum. Almost every detail of the arrangement has a close relationship to his work. In the bedroom the walls were papered with proof copies of drawings by Charles Plumier (French botanist, 1646-1704) and Georg Ehret (botanical artist,1707-1770). The curtain on the bed is printed with a decoration based on his favourite flower, the Linnaea borealis. There are other photographs by Schenson of Linnaeus' house in the V&A (see 72:384 and 72:387).",
