Having started his career performing in pubs from the age of 15, he worked his way up the music industry ladder by playing in bands with his friends, eventually becoming a staff songwriter for DJM Records. On gaining a record contract in 1970, at the age of 23, his live performance became bigger and more flamboyant. Backed by a large catalogue of ballads and piano rock, his scintillating stage shows involved him performing in wild costumes. Since the 1990s he has written several musicals, for the West End and for Disney animation.",
