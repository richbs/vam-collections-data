The pyramids are supposed to be the travellers who the tour; each pyramid having 4 counters of the same colour belonging to it, which are called markers or servants; when you find these are complete, you may begin the game agreeably to the following.\nRULES:\n1.  Each player must hold a pyramid or traveller and four counters of the same colour.\nII. In order to know who begins the game, each player must spin the totum, and the highest number takes the lead, then the next highest, &c.\nIII. the first player then spins, and if he turns up No. 4, he is to place his pyramid upon Liverpool, and stay there until it is his turn to spin again.\nIV. If, in the next spin, he turns up No. 3, he is to add that to 4, his former number, and place his pyramid on No. 7 (Cork) and in this manner the game must be continued till the traveller arrives at No. 133 (Athens), when he wins his game.\nV. If the last spin does not exactly make the No. 133, but goes beyond it, he must then go back as many numbers as he exceeds it and try his fortune again, till one of the players spins the lucky number.\nVI. When a player is obliged to wait one or more turns, he must deposit as many counters as he is directed to waist turns (which never exceeds four) when it is his turn to spin again, instead of spinning he must take up a counter and so on till all have been taken up.\n\nThe playing sheet is lettered in the lower left corner, over Morocco and Algeria with the following comment.  It is one of the very few of its kind ever found in these games.\nNB  In Africa the human mind seems degraded below its natural state, to dwell long upon the manners of this country, a country so immers'd in rudeness and barbarity, (besides that it could afford little instruction) would be disgusting to every lover of mankind.  The inhabitants of Africa are deprived at present of all arts and sciences, by which the human mind remains torpid and inactive, a gloomy sameness every where revails, and the trifling distinctions which are discovered among them, seem rather to arise from an excess of brutality on the one hand, than any perceptible approaches towards refinement on the other.\n\nRules placement: in booklet printed and sold by Wm.
