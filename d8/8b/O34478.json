He has written: \"Each place is different and yet there are some similarities even between different countries. I have wondered just what it is that I am looking for as I move from place to place. Travelling to a certain place to be able later to say that you have seen it, eaten it, bathed in it, climbed it, rode on it, etc, etc. It\u2019s a fact that we travel more today and our experience of strange and far away places has widened but has our experience deepened?\"",
