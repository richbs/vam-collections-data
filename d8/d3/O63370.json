Classical images were considered noble and had the added appeal of close-clinging draperies revealing the female figure. This porcelain figurine is one of a pair which were probably designed to stand together on a mantelpiece decoration, on either side of an imposing classically-inspired clock.\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century the Greek and Roman 'Attitudes' or poses performed privately by Emma Hamilton (c.1765-1815), and other artistic representations of Greek dancers gave an impetus to an already popular form of decoration and by the end of the 19th century serious investigation was being undertaken by Maurice Emmanuel and others into the reconstruction of Greek dance.  The dancer Isadora Duncan (1877-1927) would later become inspired by barefoot Greek dance and its revealing draperies in her performance.",
