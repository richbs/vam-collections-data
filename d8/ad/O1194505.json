This title is printed at the top of the box where there is also a shape which suggests the box could be hung on a rail in a shop. This part of the box is blue with a red border. The front and sides of the box are yellow with a clear arch shape so you can see the dolls through the box. This shape is decorated on the outside with illustrations of flowers and posts, making it look like a window in a home. The back of the box shows a colourful illustration of a family outside a house next to a tree playing with their baby. The dolls are dressed in 1970s outfits with the father wearing denim flares and a blue high-neck jumper. He has medium length brown hair. The mother is wearing a long dress which is brown with orange, white and pink flowers as a pattern. She has long blonde hair and is holding a baby dressed in an orange romper suit. The toddler is wearing a yellow top with denim dungarees. All the dolls are vinyl and have hair rooted into their heads with painted on facial details such as eyes, lips and eyebrows. The two adults have beads for eyes which are blue and orange with a black dot to mark the pupil.",

These were made in Hong Kong and therefore reflect this move. Many dolls suffered from low quality due to the manufacturers quest to decrease costs and lower prices. The price label left on this box shows that it was originally purchased for only \u00a31.50. This boom in the 20th century saw a change of pace for the world of doll production, including the introduction of novelty dolls, such as this family set.\n\nAnother set of family dolls that were popular at the same time in the US was The Sunshine Family, made in the mid 1970s by Mattel. Although these dolls weren't of the highest quality, they were charming and entertained many children of that generation. The dolls were also heavily promoted on television.",
