These were probably used to fix the figure in its original setting. No one is certain what this was. This Virgin and Child may have been set on a small altarpiece or in a niche. It may have been fixed to a lectern or a large candelabra used at Easter. \nThe metalworkers of the South Netherlands were active throughout the Middle Ages. The foundries of the Meuse Valley  were particularly famous, especially those of Dinant. Brass work  became known as 'Dinanderie' as a result of their fame. In the Middle Ages people used the words 'brass' and 'bronze' interchangeably.\nThe devotional image is typical of the area around Brabant at the end of the 15th century.",
