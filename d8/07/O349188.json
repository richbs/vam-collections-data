The firm was probably established before 1836 as G.R. Elkington & Co. in Birmingham. By the1860s it employed over 1,000 people. The company created grand presentation pieces for international exhibitions as well as mass-produced dinner services, dressing cases, tea wares and flatware. Between 1836 and 1840 Elkington's patented processes such as electrogilding and electroplating, which used electricity to coat cheaper metals with silver or gold. Imitation 'silver' products were thus made available to a much wider section of the population. Elkington's also used this technology to manufacture electrotype copies of famous art objects, such as the 16th-century cup and cover on display in the Bromley-by-Bow Room of the British Galleries.",
