Catalogue of the exhibition held at the Victoria and Albert Museum, June-September 1970.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n'(b) <b>Studies</b><b> for the illustration 'Fagin in the Condemned Cell' and other incidents in the story of </b><b><i>Oliver Twist</i></b>\nInscribed in pencil with notes and titles. Signed and inscribed in ink at a later date, <i>George Cruikshank First Idea &amp; Sketch for</i> <i>Fagin in the condemned cell</i>\n9995.J\n\nCruikshank's inscription, claiming that this was his first sketch for Fagin, was almost certainly added long after the drawing was made - compare the different styles of handwriting - and is probably contemporary with his claim to have invented the characters of <i>Oliver Twist</i>, In pose, the Fagin figures are closer to that used on the part cover, designed in 1846, than to that in the illustration.\n\nThe possibility that the sketches were made for the part cover is strengthened by the confining border around the smaller complete study, the inscription <i>wood-cut</i><i> </i>and the presence of other small sketches, different in subject but similar in format to the scenes represented on the cover design. These sketches are related to the illustrations: 'The evidence destroyed', 'The Jew and Morris Bolter begin to understand each other' and 'The Interview between Rose and Nancy'. The latter was a subject suggested by Dickens but never illustrated by Cruikshank.'",
