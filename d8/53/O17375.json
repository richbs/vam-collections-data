Moved to Dublin 1797, London about 1799; encouraged by the Scottish painter John Graham and the sculptor Joseph Banks, entered RA Schools 1800 (won silver medal for drawing 1806). Pupil and assistant of John Varley, whose sister Elizabeth (also an artist) he married 1803 (separated 1810). Exhibited 78 works at the RA between 1804 and 1862, and five at the BI 1808-9 and 1826. Wide range of subjects in early years, including history and portraits, but by 1815 almost exclusively domestic subjects of precise detail and brilliant colour, and with Wilkie the most popular and admired artist in the genre. He noted his own goals as 'Story, Character, Expression, Beauty'. Elected ARA 1815, RA 1816. Many book illustrations; accomplished draughtsman, particularly perhaps of academic nude studies. Designed first penny postage envelope 1840. Elected member of many distinguished institutions at home and abroad. Died 7 July 1863; his studio sale was at Christie's 28-30 April 1864. His four sons Paul Augustus, William junior (see entry below), Michael (see entry above) and John were all trained as artists. Much manuscript and graphic material in National Art Library and V&A collections, also Tate Gallery. \nLIT: \tF G Stephens Memorials ofWilliam Mulready RA 1890; A Rorimer Drawings by William Mulready V&A exhibition catalogue 1972; K Heleniak William Mulready 1980; M Pointon Mulready V&A exhibition book and catalogue 1986. (The three last all have full bibliographies) \nThe most comprehensive recent catalogue raison\u00e9e of Mulready's works, arranged in chronological order, has been compiled by Kathryn Moore Heleniak, in her book William Mulready 1980, which provides the basis for the following entries. Her numbers have been quoted, and a brief resume given of her listing of alternative versions and related drawings. Further reference should be made to both her book and to Marcia Pointon's catalogue Mulready which accompanied the exhibition of 1986 held at the V&A, National Gallery, Dublin and Ulster Museum, Belfast; to Heleniak for more detailed comments on related works and documentation and Pointon for social commentary and aesthetic analysis. \nThe Fight Interrupted \nFA139 Neg31856 \nPanel (on a gesso ground), 71.8 \u00d7 93.2 cm (28 \u00bd \u00d7 37 ins) \nSigned 'W Mulrea' (the rest cut off), and, according to the 1864 exhibition catalogue, dated 1816 on the pump at r., although the date is no longer visible \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \nHeleniak (93) dates the work to 1815/16. The work appears in the Account Book  under 1815 with the note 'Comp L&D [that is, composition, light and dark] \u00bd done'; it was exhibited at the RA in 1816, and evidently bought \nthere, according to the Account Book  entry for 22 July 1816, by Viscount Whitworth for \u00a3157-10-0. \nThe critic of Ackermann's Repository of Arts (June 1816, p355), thought that 'this picture, is, in every respect, superior to the last [that is, Wilkie's The Rabbit on the Wall]: it has far more expression, better drawing, and chaste colouring. It is, in fact, the point of attraction in the great room'. Such was the painting's success that some later critics overrated its importance: for example, the Athenaeum reviewer in 1864 thought: 'The exhibition of this work insured Mulready's election as ARA in the November following its appearance at the Academy', while in fact the artist had been elected ARA in November 1815 (probably on the strength of Idle Boys exhibited earlier that year) and RA very soon afterwards ('A course of which there is no subsequent instance' - Redgrave Century 1866, II pp310, 11). \nThe fullest description and analysis of the subject accompanies an engraving by Lumb Stocks in the Art Journal of 1875. \nThe subject matter of the painting has aroused comment since its first exhibition; the New Monthly Magazines (July 1816, p355) critic wrote: 'The interest which this picture excites would doubtless astonish, and perhaps disgust a foreigner, who, unused to such scenes, might censure the taste of the artist in the selection of his subject, but for our own parts we prefer the representation of a fight of this sort, which is purely national, to all the pictures of Waterloo which we have yet seen: - in fact, we have now no small authority for our preference, for, at a late public dinner, a gallant general, who has fought and bled for his country, declared that he owed all his success and reputation to the first black eye he received at Westminster; and \"no less strange than true\", this remark was followed by a similar avowal from a British judge .... On the whole, we hesitate not to pronounce this one of the very best pictures in the room.'\nHeleniak draws attention to Mulready's interest in boxing, one of the most popular sports around 1800, and encouraged by his father (he seems to have received instruction from the celebrated pugilist Mendoza). W P Frith recorded in his Autobiography (III, p228) that Mulready 'always took great interest in street fights when opponents were equally matched. I saw him one day with an intense expression of interest on his face ... and when I reached him I saw the cause of his interest in the form of two boys who were pummelling one another, displaying what he called true British pluck.' Heleniak seems right to note that Mulready 'was also known to enjoy watching rough street fights between boys'; it is perhaps significant that his drawing 'from the living model' in 1800 was of wrestlers (also V&A collections). A drawing by Mulready in the V&A collections (6633) records a street fight. \nEXH: \tRA 1816 (65); Royal Hibernian Academy, 1817; Society of Arts 1848 (XXXII); William Mulready South Kensington Museum 1864, (46); Guildhall 1904 (115).

When Mulready was a teenager, in the years around 1800, boxing was one of the most popular sports in England, and he was encouraged by his father to take lessons from the celebrated pugilist Mendoza.  The artist is supposed to have been devoted to watching street fights, and it is interesting that the drawing from the living model that he submitted to the RA Schools in 1800 depicted a pair of wrestlers.  Here, Mulready shows the playground of a school; the schoolmaster has interrupted a fight, and seized the wrong culprit.  It is an excellent example of a type of painting that needs to be 'read' through detail and gesture, like a written narrative, in order to comprehend the story.  The type became increasingly popular as the century continued, as other pictures in this exhibition testify.",
