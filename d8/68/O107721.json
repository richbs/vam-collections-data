The V&A acquired several pieces from Tam's 'Mao Collection' of spring, 1995.  Pictures of Mao Zedong were ubiquitous during his lifetime and, after his death in 1976, they persisted.  Some were worked anew and used in contexts that were sometimes controversial and contradictory.   Vivienne Tam collaborated with Zhang Hongtu, an artist who first depicted Mao in his paintings in 1987.  She emblazoned the Chairman's features onto coloured T-shirts and dresses.  The dress here gives a new twist to the image of Mao.",
