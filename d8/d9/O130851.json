Together with the cornemuse, a bagpipe with a mouthpiece, it has a much softer and more flute-like sound than the more familiar Scottish version of the instrument. The windbag is made of air-tight, greased silk, covered with layers of silk bags, and the protruding pipe, chanters and drone barrel are made of ivory. Unlike the cornemuse, the musette was fitted with bellows to provide the necessary wind, but the bellows are now missing from this example. The drone barrel was fitted with slots and slides, which helped tune the drones, which provided the background hum, and cut out any unwanted sounds.\n\nOn loan to the Horniman Museum.",
