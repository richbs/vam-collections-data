The Annunciation is the religious theme most commonly used by the weavers of south-west Scania, especially in Torna (south-west Scania). This version of the design is often found on carriage cushion covers and it is possible that it was first copied from an old woodcut etching. While it appears in different combinations of colours, the smallest details remain in the same position on many of the known examples, although sometimes the design is mirrored.",
