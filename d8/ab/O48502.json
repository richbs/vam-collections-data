It seems that the men met professionally, perhaps Gill had some of his work engraved or printed by Hunter's company, but little is known about the circumstances of the commission for the clock.  It is not known who made the clock or the horological parts [nb Francis Brody, external clock specialist to examine movement etc].  \n\nAccording to Mrs Janie Bright, Edward Hunter's second daughter, the clock stood in the hallway of the family's small country house, Easeway, in Frensham, Surrey.  Mrs Bright recalls that there was also a framed map hanging over a cosy stove in the hallway, and this was also designed and painted by Gill - the frame was painted in greens and blues to match the clock.  [see curator's comment]\n\nThe initials of the Hunter family are incorporated into the decorative scheme on either side of the clock face.  On the proper right side - 'MEHEW' - ME stands for Mabel Elisabeth, H for Hunter, and EW for Edward William ie husband and wife.  On the proper left side - 'ECJHECE' - which are the initials of the four daughters: Elisabeth Curling (3rd child), Janie (2nd child), Hunter, Eileen (1st child), and Ellen Claire (4th child).  The initials of Ellen Claire appear to have been reversed in the monogram.\n\nEileen Hunter, Edward Hunter's eldest daughter, took over the Surrey house when her father died.  In 1979 she lent the clock to the Thirties Exhibition at the Hayward and offered it to the V&A as a bequest.\n\nHistorical significance: Eric Gill is well-known for his work as a typographer, wood engraver and sculptor.  The delicate lettering on either side of the upper part of the clock is an unusual application of Gill's typographical skills. Gill designed very few applied works and little is known about why he came to design this clock for Edward Hunter. There are no direct precedents for the design although Gill may have been familiar with a painted clock by Charles Voysey, dated 1895 and published in The Studio in 1896 (which is now in the V&A's collection, W.5-1998).\n[Longcase clock movement] The clock mechanism is spring driven and appears to be contemporary with the casework.",
