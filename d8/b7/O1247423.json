She works in a variety of media but her primary practice is in printmaking and book arts. A recurring theme in her work is the depiction of light, and this print comes from an informal series in which the central motif was house or similar structure lit from within, sometimes seen through a screen of trees (as here) or set in a spare coastal landscape. These fragile-looking structures also refer to the temporary shelters, known as 'benders' constructed out of branches and polythene or tarpaulin by homeless people and Travellers.  They also reference fairy tales and speak to the universal human need for shelter and warmth. Stove is of special relevance to the V&amp;A because it was inspired by Paxton's Great Stove, a hothouse in the gardens at Chatsworth, which in turn inspired Paxtons' design for the Crystal Place.",
