Sk\u00e5ne province, in the extreme south of Sweden, has the richest tradition, and more jewellery was worn there than in any other district.   Almost all the Swedish traditional jewellery at the V&A comes from Sk\u00e5ne.  \n\nSwedish women used numerous kinds of clasp and brooch to fasten and decorate their traditional costume, but this is not a traditional design.  There is little to identify this clasp as coming from Sk\u00e5ne, apart from the silver marks, which show it was made by Sven Magnus Ramberg, who worked in Lund from 1822 to 1858.",
