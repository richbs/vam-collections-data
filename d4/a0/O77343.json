This arch was erected over  Fenchurch Street and  took more than 40 days to build. It may not have looked exactly like the print because there are some discrepancies between its representation here and contemporary written descriptions of it. In the accompanying text the writer conjures up the atmosphere on the day:  'The gladsome and long-desired Morning at length is come, In which the Streetes seem to be paved with people, that in heapes flocke together'.\n\nTrading\nThis print was part of a publication called The Arch's of Triumph Erected in honor of the High and mighty prince, James, the first of that name, King, of England, and sixth of Scotland, at his Maiesties Entrance and passage through his Honorable Citty & chamber of London. The City of London had paid for five of the seven temporary arches. They subsidised this publication to ensure that there would be a permanent record of their magnificent gesture.",
