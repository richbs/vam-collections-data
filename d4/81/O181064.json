The chair has a circular wooden ring held in place by wooden spokes, this is intended to hold a small child in place and to give them something secure to hold on to.  At the front of the seat is attached a wooded carved horse's head and neck.  It has a leather bridle and possibly originally had reins.  The horse's ears would also have been made from leather but are missing: all that remains are stubs of leather.  On the rockers is a foot plate and on the sides are back painted decorative lines.\n\nThere are signs of damage and repair, there are two broken points on the safety ring, and on the left rocker.  The seat has a split through the right hand side.",

Toy horses have been played with for thousands of years, but it was not until the seventeenth century that ride-on ones were first developed.  They were seen as an important developmental toy for children, who would often be riding real horses from a young age, as they helped with balance and confidence. Children would also enjoy acting out riding stories on tier horses and would often push the horses to the limit to see how hard and fast they could ride them.  \n\nAt their height of their popularity rocking horses were made in their thousands by skilled craftsmen and would have been expensive to buy.  Many have survived as they were well looked after and often belonged to several generations of a family.  This one has been made for very young children and has a safety bar to help hold the child in.",
