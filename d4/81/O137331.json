            "public_access_description": "Photograph of Lichfield Cathedral door at West end showing an arch in the Decorated style of medieval architecture with a central figure on a column against doors decorated with scrollwork. This albumen print, a type of photograph, was probably made in 1861 from a glass negative in the photographic studio in the factory building of Skidmore & Co., at  Alma Street, Coventry.  This photograph was probably taken about the same time as the Lichfield Cathedral screen was made and comes from an archive of designs and photographs from the firm.  Francis Skidmore (1817-1896) was a leading Victorian metalworker in the Gothic Revival style, which was an architectural movement the nineteenth-century practitioners of which sought to revive medieval forms.  Skidmore also produced church plate, light fittings, and furniture but was best known for his innovative architectural ironwork of which the screen for Lichfield Cathedral which was recorded in another such photograph (museum number E.3008-2007)  is an example.",
