He first appeared under it at the Oxford Music-Hall on 13 April 1895 when his early act consisted of sketches in which he mimicked music-hall stars of the day, using clip-on paper costumes to allow as many as forty-two changes in one act. He went on to develop various sketches based on middle-class leisure pursuits such as fishing, golfing and gardening which he performed with a small company.\n\nMotoring,Tate's first great success, became hugely popular for his company in the music halls. The sketch is about a father, an idiotic son in his Eton suit, and a chauffeur attempting to take the son back to school in a car that won\u2019t start. The son sat in the back of the car making inane comments such as \u2018It\u2019s amazing, pa-pa\u2019, and \u2018Goodbye-eee\u2019. 'Goodbye-eee' became Tate\u2019s best-known catchphrase and the inspiration for the popular World War I song.",
