Italian goldsmiths were expert at making a little material go a very long way.  Many pieces seem too large to wear comfortably, but they are usually made of very thin gold, and are much lighter than they appear.  \n\nIn the 19th century, filigree was a speciality of the Genoese region, on the north-west coast of Italy.  The villages around Genoa made gold and silver filigree jewellery in traditional styles, mainly for the local population.  Goldsmiths in the city of Genoa itself aimed their filigree at a wider audience, and exhibited and sold their products widely throughout Europe.\n\nThis earring was bought for \u00a32 4s.
