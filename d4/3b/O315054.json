Pairs of these screens were often part of a symmetrical arrangement of ornaments and other decorative objects on a mantelpiece. These examples are painted with views of Christ Church, Oxford, and were sold by Spiers & Son, High Street, Oxford. The shop, established in 1834, specialised in stock made of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9, and painted with views of the University buildings. Many of the smaller items, including these hand screens, were presumably bought as souvenirs by undergraduates or visitors. The shop premises included a workshop where customers could order their own decoration of family coats of arms and other personal designs to be painted on blanks such as boxes, trays, candlesticks or hand screens. Many of these blanks would have been made in the West Midlands, the centre of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 manufacture in Britain.",

Spiers & Son specialised in a wide range of objects made of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9, ranging from chairs, tables and screens, to pen trays, letter racks, and cigar cases, many articles decorated with views of Oxford. The shop frontage was illustrated in <i>The Adventures of Mr Verdant Green</i> by Cuthbert Bede, the pseudonym of Edward Bradley. This description of the adventures of a new Oxford undergraduate, published in 1853, included details of special purchases for family gifts, with decoration painted to order, a speciality of Spiers & Son. \n\nSpiers & Son exhibited at the Great Exhibition in 1851, being awarded an Honourable Mention by the Jurors for their exhibits which included an extensive display in a glass case. They also exhibited in New York in 1853, winning a Prize Medal, and were awarded an Honourable Mention at the Paris Universelle Exhibition in 1855. By 1871 the firm was managed by R.J. Spiers's two sons. Although he petitioned for bankruptcy in 1872, the firm exhibited at the Paris Universal Exhibition in 1878. Spiers & Son finally closed in 1890.",
