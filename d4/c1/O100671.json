            "history_note": "W.12\u201313-1938 share with W.14\u201319-1938 (which were also bequeathed by Lady Theobald) the use of needlework covers which were evidently worked for chairs of an earlier date; and as on those chairs this appears to be an 18th-century marriage \u2013 i.e. these seem to be the first and only covers to have been placed on the frames, and indeed they appear not to have been used previously on any other frames. See following extract from LMW\u2019s forthcoming catalogue of Lady Lever upholstered furniture (entry on two chairs en suite with W.12\u201313-1938):\n\nThe V&A chairs were bequeathed to the Museum by Lady (Winifred Sarah) Theobald, the daughter of Thomas William Jackson,(1) and the second wife and widow of Sir Henry Studdy Theobald, K.C. (1847\u20131934).(2) Her will mentions a number of other pieces of furniture and pictures, at least some of which were evidently inherited, but does not reveal which of these came from her family and which from her husband\u2019s.(3) Among the items that would appear to concern her own family are \u2018my framed Bishop pedigree\u2019, bequeathed to Mrs Zara Frith, and \u2018my oil painting of the Bishop ancestor by Cornelius Jansen and the Chippendale easel on which it stands\u2019, left to Miss Doris Wheler. Doris Wheler and her brothers Trevor and Francis Glynne Wheler were \u2013 with Zara Frith and one Robert de C. Tronson \u2013 Lady Theobald\u2019s principal legatees. The Bishop connection came through the Whelers\u2019 paternal grandmother, one Elizabeth Bishop (1820\u20131900) of \u2018Grey\u2019s Wood\u2019 (i.e. Grayswood, near Haslemere) in Surrey.(4) Their earlier ancestry remains to be disentangled,(5) but \u2013 to judge by the portrait and its easel \u2013 it would appear that the Bishops at least were fairly prosperous in the 17th and 18th centuries, and might quite plausibly have commissioned this suite. However, it is equally possible that the two V&A chairs were recent purchases by the Theobalds themselves.\n\n\n(1) He is listed in the Post Office London Directory from at least 1876 to 1900 as Thomas Wm. Jackson, stationer, POST OFFICE Receiving Ho. Money Order and Savings Bank, 24 & 25 Albion Street, Hyde Park. Mrs. Elizabeth Jackson (his widow?) is listed at the same address in 1902, and was still there in 1911. His will has not been traced.\n\n(2) His will, proved 12 July 1934, makes no specific bequests except financial legacies, his wife being his residuary legatee. His estate was valued at \u00a3185,062 10s. 6d. gross, \u00a3174,122 17s. 4d. net.\n\n(3) Her will was proved on 9 April 1938; estate valued at \u00a3137,571 6s. 7d. gross, \u00a3122,833 11s. 3d. net. \n\n(4) For the relationships between the Whelers, see LDS, Ancestral File: Doris Laura (b. 1886), Trevor (b. 1888), and Francis Glynne (b. 1891) were the children of Francis Henry Wheler (b. 1848) and Sarah Jane, n\u00e9e Highett (b. 1854). Francis Henry\u2019s father was another Francis Wheler, and his mother was Elizabeth Bishop \u2018of Grey\u2019s Wood\u2019, who is said to have been born on 2 February 1820, but her parents are not named; she died 16 March 1900, at Southport, Lancashire, and was buried at Leamington, Hastings, 21 March 1900. \nRobert de C. Tronson was evidently a relative of Sir Henry Jackson\u2019s, whose will (see note ?) identifies one Hillam Tronson (Lady Theobald\u2019s godson) as his nephew.\n\n(5) There is apparently no close connection with the Wheler family of Otterden Place, Kent; still less with the Bisshopps of Parham Park, Sussex.",
