Her tapestries are known for their bold, simple imagery and a strong use of colour.  Her recurring themes are the unlikely forms of birds and beasts combined with abstract shapes and patterns.  A trip to Japan in 2001 led to her current fascination with the Japanese kimono.  The layering of the cloth, the colour and pattern all influenced her subsequent ideas and she began to move away from the constraints of working within a small frame and embraced the freedom of a larger canvas.  In Go Shokai Shimasu, the Japanese name for Let Me Introduce You, Rutherford has used the kimono shape as her canvas, thus highlighting the idea that clothing can grow from one piece of fabric.",

For the forthieth anniversary exhibition of the 62 Group of Textiles Artists, held in Gallery 101 at the V&A, Rutherford created 'Go-Shokai Shimasu' (Let Me Introduce You).  Described as 'Issey Miyake meets the V&A's collection of kimonos and ritual robes, fusing traditional  and contemporary design, 'Go-Shokai Shimasu' pays homage to the kimono.  It is the first tapestry to show the influence of Japanese textiles and marked a change in the direction of Rutherford's work and professional life.",
