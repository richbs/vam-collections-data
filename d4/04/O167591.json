W.24 to 24A.\"\n\n24/4/34 Minute Paper\nrecords their condition: \"chipped, parts missing - six pedestals - received (collected from Messrs Christies by McDouall) for gift\".\n\n8/5/34 Note O Brackett\nrequests \"pair of candelabra by Matthew Boulton and the six Adam pedestals from the Zetland sale\"\n\nNotes from R.P. 34/1791\n\n17/4/34 Memorandum C Smith to Brackett\nsummarises the items in Christie's April 26th \"Zetland Collection\" sale and proposes that the NACF be approached to purchase two lots for the Museum.  He laments that because \"nearly all of the Adam furniture made for Sir Lawrence Dundas, ancestor of Lord Zetland, is in sets\"  it is beyond the reach of the Museum.  He suggests the purchase of\nLot 78: \"Six Pedestals by Robert Adam\".  He proposes that 4 pedestals could be used by the Sculpture Department for English busts; and 2 could serve as stands for Lot 53: a pair of candelabra by Mathew Boulton.  (the memorandum contains a detailed history of the candelabra) which were made for Dundas at the same date as the pedestals, i.e. about 1765, and in the illustration of them in the \"Dictionary of English Furniture\" by Macquoid and Edwards (Vol. III, p.154, fig. 8) they are shown standing on the pedestals.   The Metalwork Dept. agree that, if acquired, the candelabra be shown on their pedestals in the Dept of Woodwork.\n\nMr Edwards has informed H C Smith that \"the pedestals were probably executed for Sir Lawrence Dundas by a cabinet maker of the name of Samuel Norman.  Mr Bolton, of the Soane Museum, who illustrates them in his work on the Adams brothers, was unaware of this\".\n\n17/4/34 letter, Brackett to the Director\ndescribes the pedestals as \"an important acquisition for the Museum as we have no documented Adam furniture in the permanent collections\".  Brackett explains the proposal to have 4 of the 6 pedestals used to display sculpture.\n\n18/4/34 letter, Maclagan to Sir Robert Witt, NACF\nsuggests the acquisition of lots 53 and 78.  He describes the 6 Adam pedestals as \"of extraordinary beauty\" and notes \"such pedestals are particularly valuable to us in enhancing the beauty of our 18th century busts\u2026\" and two of them would be used to display lot 53.  \"There is no doubt that these two candelabra standing on the two pedestals would form a most attractive addition to our collections and would excite a great deal of public attention.  We have at present no documented Adam furniture in our permanent collections and these pedestals appear to be admirable examples on a comparatively modest scale of his method of decoration\u2026.\"  He encloses photographs and explains that while 2 pedestals show slight damage; the others are intact.  Any damage could easily be repaired in the Museum workshop.\n\n18/4/34 letter, Maclagan to John Hugh Smith \nasks him to support the NACF purchase as both lots \"appear to be quite first-rate of their kind\".\n\n19/4/34 Handwritten notes\nSir Alex Martin (NACF) offers to do the bidding.  The NACF voted \u00a3300 for the pedestals and \u00a3450 for the candelabra.\n\n26/4/34 notes H C Smith\nrecords the sale results:\n\"Lot 53 - The ormolu candelabra were secured for 170 guineas\"\n\"Lot 78 - The 6 pedestals were secured for 30 guineas\"",
