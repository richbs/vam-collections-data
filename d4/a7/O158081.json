The belief that bread and wine become the body and blood of Christ when consecrated during Mass was reaffirmed in the 16th century. It was a central decree issued by the Council of Trent which set out to confirm and strengthen the doctrines of the Catholic Church. This led to the increased production of exquisite vessels for Catholic worship.\n\nThe cover of this ciborium shows a pelican piercing her breast to feed blood to her young. This is a symbol for the Passion of Christ. The ciborium is decorated with saints whose legends are associated with the Eucharist. St Hyacinth, a 13th-century Dominican monk, rescued a monstrance containing the consecrated host, as well as a statue of the Virgin, during an attack on his monastery in Kiev.\n\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes. Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",

He worked in Paris in 1667 and even in 1673-74 is recorded as officially employed by his mother, Catharina Staels. Married twice, Josephus I Hennekin had two sons. His elder son Michiel Hennekin (born 1683) was to be his successor and as such was apprenticed to the Antwerp sculptor Joannes Claudius de Cock, but decided to become a Catholic priest instead. In 1720 his younger son, Josephus II Hennekin (1689-1758), became a master silversmith, and eventually succeeded Josephus I Hennekin as head of the family workshop.",
