The veil was was supposed to have been made by one of them for her marriage to Mr. Hare of Curtisknowe, South Devon.\n\nResearch has shown that the Wise family of Woolston were a well-off family, with Woolston House being a large mansion in Loddiswell, north-north west of Kingsbridge, Devon. This makes it unlikely that the sisters would have been lace-makers and embroiderers, and suggests that the veil was a special purchase or commission for one of the sisters, rather than having been made by them.\n\nThe bride died in 1824 when her daughter was three years old, so the marriage would have been on or before 1821. It was subsequently worn by the daughter, Matilda E. Hare, when she married the Reverend George Dawson (for 40 years the Rector of Woodleigh in South Devon) on June 4th 1844. The veil passed down to Matilda and George's third daughter, Miss Louisa Dawson, who donated it to the Museum in 1945 at the age of 92 and a half.\n\nClare Browne has looked at this veil and notes it is a very neat, very professionally worked piece and a very early example of Carrickmacross appliqu\u00e9. The styling and size of the piece are consistent with other bonnet veils of the 1820s, though if it pre-dates 1824, it is really quite exceptionally early for this work.",
