The silk is a complete loom width; it has been cut rather unevenly at the top edge, which was originally turned under and pleated into the waist of the petticoat. There is a slit cut into the centre of the panel, from the top, which was made for access to a pocket worn beneath. The slit was originally hemmed; this has been unpicked.\n\nThe design is in the form of vertical lines of 2 motifs each, alternating between floral and largely geometic. They are shaded blues. A self coloured geometric trellis lies behind them all, giving a slightly chinoiserie style. \n\nThe silk has a plain weave cream coloured ground, with a self-coloured supplementary warp making an overall background pattern, and incorporated into some of the motifs. There is a separate group of supplementary warps in three shades of blue (pale, mid and dark) which form the main part of the motifs. These warps form short floats on the front but have been cut where they would have formed long floats on the back; their ends have been bound in to secure them.",

In the 18th century such petticoats were intended to be seen as part of  women's fashionable dress and were worn with gowns that were open from the  waist to reveal them. They were made either of fabric matching the gown, or of a  contrasting fabric.\n\nThe silk, with its interesting restrained colouring, appears to combine elements from two designs by Anna Maria Garthwaite made for the master weaver Mr Sabatier, one of her best customers, in 1753  (museum acquisition no. 5989.21).\n\nAnna Maria Garthwaite was an independent textile designer who lived and worked  in Spitalfields from about 1730 until her death in 1763. She was one of the leading  pattern drawers for the English silk industry, producing as many as eighty designs  a year to commissions from master weavers and mercers.",
