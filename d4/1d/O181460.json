Mirbeau (b.1848; d. 1917) was a French art critic, journalist, novelist and playwright.\n\nHenry Nocq (1868- 1944), was a sculptor and medallist and one of the most qualified representatives of modern French Art. He studied under Chapu, and first began to exhibit at the Paris Salon in 1887.\n\nPlaquettes are small plaques made of bronze, brass, lead or precious metals. They originated in the 1440s with the desire to reproduce coins and hardstone engravings from ancient Greece and Rome. Some were made as collector's pieces, to be viewed and displayed in private, and others for practical purposes. They also inspired designs in other media, from architecture to bookbindings.",
