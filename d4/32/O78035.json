The asymmetry and simple naturalism of the design are influenced by Japanese art.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThis dessert plate is made in earthenware with an on-glaze transfer-printed decoration in brown. The colours have been added by hand. Transfer prints were commercially available and could be bought and used by several factories. Each factory made its own choice in how to position the printed design on the ware and whether to add colours, or gilding by hand. Brown-Westhead, Moore & Co. registered this arrangement as a 'Pattern for dinner service' in June 1884.\n\nManufacturer\nBrown-Westhead, Moore & Co operated the Cauldon Place Works, Hanley, Staffordshire, established about 1802 by Job Ridgway (died 1814). The company was one of the largest in the area by the 1870s, with over 1000 employees. It made a wide variety of table and toilet wares in earthenware and porcelain, and ornamental Parian, eggshell porcelain and majolica wares. It also supplied both the British and Russian royal families.",
