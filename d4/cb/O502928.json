It is one of a series of diagrams used for this purpose.  Wornum published the gist of his lectures in which he refers to diagrams just as a lecturer today might point to a visual aid.\n\nSubject Depicted\nThis image reproduces a frieze at Mantua of about 1630, and is part of the Renaissance series of ornament. Other subjects represented by his diagrams include Islamic decoration, Medieval stained glass, and Egyptian Temple painting. Wornum was a great advocate of using historical ornament as the basis for teaching. In his book entitled Analysis of Ornament (Chapman &amp; Hall, 1856), he reviewed the development of ornamental styles throughout history. He taught that the basic shapes of these historical forms should be followed and applied to modern design. \n\nPeople\nRalph Nicholson Wornum (1812-1877) was appointed Lecturer on Art to the Government Schools of Design in 1848. The gist of his lectures is recorded in two books, Report of Twelve Lectures on the history of Ornamental Art delivered by R N Wornum to the students of the Department of Art, Marlborough House(1855), and Analysis of Ornament.
