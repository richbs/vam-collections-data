It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years. Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nThe Japanese musical The Geisha by Owen Hall, with music by Sidney Jones, was first produced at Daly's Theatre in 1896 and revived there in 1903 and 1931. This tour of the 1931 revival starred Leo Sheffield, who was one of the D'Oyly Carte Company's principal stars from 1915 to 1928. He appeared regularly on the London stage and on tour throughout the 1930s, made several films, served with E.N.S.A in wartime and in 1947 appeared as himself and as Pooh-Bah in the original radio biography Gilbert and Sullivan.",
