The game was first manufactured by Waddingtons in 1949. Since then, Cluedo has been relaunched and updated several times. In addition to this there have been a number of themed or special edition versions of the game. At the beginning of play, three cards, one person, one weapon, and one room, are chosen at random and put into the Murder Cards slipcase. The rest of the cards are divided among the players. The aim of the game is to work out which cards have been concealed. As there are six different characters, six possible murder weapons and nine different rooms, there are many permutations and possibilities.",
