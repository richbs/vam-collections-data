The design centres in a medallioned profile head, supported by slender and winged grotesques and is stopped at the sides by demi-candelabra. In the plinth the scroll design centres in human terminals supporting a blank escutcheon. The wood is fine and close in grain, soft to the tool, and light in tone, the relief taking a very lustrous metallic polish.'",
