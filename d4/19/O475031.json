The pottery flourished from the mid 1870s until about 1890, but limped on after Terry's retirement at that time into the early years of the 20th century. Early wares were influenced by those manufactured in Sind as Terry set up his workshop with a Sindhi craftsman called Nur Muhammad. Soon, however, much of the decoration came to be influenced by the cave paintings at Ajanta, which  had been discovered earlier in the century, and were copied by the Schools students over a period lasting from 1872-1885, elements of which were adapted and used to decorate the ceramics in an attempt to encourage traditions of Indian art rather than European ones. Liberty imported some wares to sell in its Regent Street shop in London. This particular shape was described as 'Egyptian' in the Wonderland Art Register and it was in great demand at international exhibitions in the 1880s and 1890s See Stronge, Susan,'Wonderland', <u>Ceramics: The International Journal of Ceramics and Glass</u>, London, issue V, August 1987, pp. 48-53.",
