Its traditional jewellery often retains many medieval characteristics lost elsewhere.\n\nIcelandic women wore many decorative appliqu\u00e9s on their costume, on their dress and headband, as well as the belt.  The appliqu\u00e9s on this belt were originally made as bodice fasteners.  These were worn in pairs down the front of the bodice, with the large loops facing each other.  The wearer laced her bodice by running a cord tightly through the loops, from side to side, like lacing a shoe.  These bodice fasteners come from many sets, some cast, and some made of filigree, which is one of the most characteristic elements of Icelandic traditional jewellery.",
