Calcite alabaster is very hard and was used in ancient times. And gypsum alabaster which is a fine-grained, soft and smooth stone. \nAlthough at first glance it looks a little like marble, which it was intended to imitate, it was much easier to carve due to its softness, and alabaster objects were therefore significantly cheaper to produce.",
