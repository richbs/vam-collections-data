His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nAnatole de Grunwald commissioned Messel to design costumes and sets for a film version of Alexander Pushkin\u2019s supernatural short story The Queen of Spades in 1949.   Post war rationing meant that materials were difficult to acquire, and Messel made inventive use of unusual materials to create the eerie atmosphere of the Countess\u2019s  Baroque palace in early nineteenth century St. Petersburg.\n\nA design for the exterior of the Countess\u2019s palace in nineteenth century St. Petersburg.  Messel studied the work of the eighteenth century classicist architect Charles Cameron (1745-1812), who worked in Russia as Catherine the Great\u2019s private architect and also built country residences for Russian nobility.",
