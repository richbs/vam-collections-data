This Chinese Mandarin costume was acquired by Leonard, but found its way into Oliver's collection.  He would have admired it for its style and for the craftsmanship in the embroidered decoration.  However, the family did not regard their collections as museum objects and Maud wore the clothes she acquired, which must have caused a sensation even in 'bohemian' society.  Similarly, Oliver wore this costume for the Chelsea Arts Ball, for many years one of the most riotious (and often notorious) bohemian events of the year, where everyone tried to outdo each other in ever more imaginative and outlandish costumes. The ball was described in 1947 as 'the fabulous Chelsea Arts Ball (which) draws thousands of gay revelers to Albert Hall for a mad-cap round of gaiety and frolic, climaxed by a midnight brawl.'  \n\nOliver Messel (1904-1978) was Britain's leading theatre designer from the early 1930s to the mid 1950s, working in every aspect of entertainment - ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue - as well as in interior decoration and textile design.  His lavish, painterly and romantic designs informed by period styles, were perfectly in tune with his times and earned him an international reputation.  By 1960, however, Messel's style had become unfashionable, having no sympathy with the new 'kitchen sink' school of theatre.  He increasingly concentrated on his non-theatrical painting and designing and eventually retired to the Caribbean, where he began a new career designing and building highly idiosyncratic luxury villas.",
