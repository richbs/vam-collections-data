Three different cottons are used, one on the outside, one as a lining and a third to form a collar and facings down the front. The kimono has broad straight sleeves, and is slightly flared from the shoulders. It is not fastened in any way. The cotton on the outside of the kimono has a floral design with flowers outlined in white, some with pink or mauve centres, and black stalks on blue ground. The lining is pale blue with wavy white stems linking groups of delicately coloured flowers. The facing is striped with a dark and light blue with groups of interconnected coloured squares at intervals.",

Until 1879, when it became part of Japan' the islands were an independent kingdom. Robes such as this were worn only by members of the Ry\u00fbky\u00fban royal family. The pattern of maple leaves has been created using stencils and bright mineral pigments. This technique is known as 'bingata'.",
