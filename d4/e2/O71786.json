            "public_access_description": "This relief was one of 850 objects given to the Museum shortly after the firm of George Jackson & Sons moved  from its old premises at the Rathbone Works, Rainville Road, Hammersmith, in 1989. At around the same time the Weald and Downland Open Air Museum, near Chichester, acquired pattern boards with 'positives'  from Jackson's. \n\nWhen it entered the Museum's collections, it was suggested that this relief  was designed by a follower of John Flaxman, possibly Henry Stothard, and that it was cast from an early 19th-century mould. The relief would probably have been used as part of an interior decorative scheme.\n\nGeorge Jackson &amp; Sons Ltd, named after its founder George Jackson (1756-1840) was established in 1780 in premises at 49 Rathbone Place, London. They were London manufacturers specialized in papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 mouldings and in the casting of decorative plasterwork for interiors and were closely associated with the architect Robert Adam, whose designs were executed in plasterwork. In an attempt to find a cheaper way to produce ornamental detail required for his interior designs, Adam had purchased from John Liardet his patented recipe for the composition, which he then passed to Jackson, who carved the moulds in boxwood, and used the plaster formula to press out the ornamental detail. The firm later moved to Rainville Road, Hammersmith, by which time the collection of moulds numbered around 20,000. The company was taken over around 1988 by Clark &amp; Fenn Ltd.",
