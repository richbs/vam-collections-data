All of the designs were inspired by objects chosen for exhibition in the V&A's new British Galleries, and related material from the collections - these ranged from a 17th-century flock wallpaper through embroideries and tooled leather to playing cards. The result is a contemporary collection of wallcoverings designed to give a feeling of luxury and richness. These wallpapers are evidence of the current revival of wallpaper, and they are also of interest as a 'heritage' collection which is not simply a re-working of older wallpaper patterns.",
