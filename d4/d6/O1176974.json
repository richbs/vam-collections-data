She trained in Theatre Design at Central Saint Martins college and uses traditional millinery techniques to create delicate and whimsical headpieces. Her current work explores the often ambiguous relationship that women have with food.\n\nThe broad bean salad headpiece has a blocked canvas base covered in dyed silk organza with the edges wired and bound in hand-dyed silk organza. The assorted salads were made using dyed silk taffeta and silk velvet which were cut to pattern with some being wired. The crinkled effect on some of the lettuce leaves was created with dyed silk organza, which was scrunched into a tight ball, tied with a string and left to dry. The pecorino cheese shavings were made from dyed silk taffeta and organza. The beans and peas were made from epoxy resin which was handpainted and attached to wire, the pea shoots were created from pieces of wire covered in florists tape. All the components were handsewn to the base. \nThe headpiece was then lined in dyed silk taffeta. It has been designed to be worn on the right side of the head and has an integral hair comb inside to keep it on the head.",
