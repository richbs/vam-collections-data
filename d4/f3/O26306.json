This game is played either with a pair of Dice or with a Totum marked on 12 sides, and any number of persons may play.\n2.  Each player must be provided with two dozen counters, which they may value as they please.\n3.  In order to know who begins the Game, let each person throw; and whoever has the highest number is first player.\n4.  Every player at the commencement of the game, puts down seven counters on the Jew.\n5.  Whoever throws first  must put down as many Counters as the Number thrown, and on that Number they must be placed.\n6.  The second Person who throws does the same and so  on; but if any Player throws the same Number (seven excepted) as a former one he is to take up the counters placed on that number, and the next player proceeds.\n7.  Every one who throws seven, must deposit as many counters on the Jew, and these are not to be taken up, until some one throws twelve, who clears the board.\n8.  Any person throwing before the last player has put down or taken up his number of counters shall forfeit seven to the Jew, and throw over again.\nNB.  If by chance one or both the dice fall off the table, the player may throw again.\n\n\nRules placement: on the playing sheet",
