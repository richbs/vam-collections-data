The first door, executed between 1403 and 1424, was decorated with reliefs containing scenes from the New Testament.  For the second door, in which the scenes were to be drawn from the Old Testament, Leonardo Bruni (1370- 1444) submitted a programme at the invitation of the Calimala guild. This programme was rejected in favour of a new scheme, which may have been drawn up by Ambrogio Traversari (1386-1439). In July 1452, it was decided to set up the new doors, not at the North portal for which they had been intended, but \"because of their beauty\", at the East entrance opposite the Cathedral. In order to achieve this, Ghiberti's first bronze doors were shifted from the East entrance to their present location, the North entrance.\nThe narrative reliefs represent:\nLEFT DOOR:\n1The Creation of Adam, the Creation of Eve, the Fall and the Expulsion from Paradise\n2The story of Noah\n3Essau and Jacob\n4The story of Moses\n5David and Goliath\n\nRIGHT DOOR:\n1Cain and Abel\n2The story of Abraham\n3The story of Joseph\n4The story of Joshua\n5Solomon and The Queen of Sheba\n\nFraming the reliefs are 24 heads and 24 figures of prophets in niches.  The door surround contains a frieze of birds and sprays of fruit and flowers.",
