The owner recalls using three clothing coupons when purchasing it. Though the cotton has faded to a light brown, its original dark brown colour would have been striking. In keeping with wartime regulations, the construction of this swimsuit uses few materials:  printed cotton and thin elastic. The fabric is smocked or gathered into squares created by bands of elastic. This technique gives the garment the fitted yet flexible shape necessary for swimwear.",
