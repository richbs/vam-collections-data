The sides of the bag have been secured with oversewing in blocks of colour, each forming a chevron pattern.\nEnd finish: \nLower: plainweave with red wool weft, turned under and secured. 7 rows of weft twining in black/white, red/blue, black/white and red/blue and then a band of 8 sections of weft twining woven with slits between each block for the fastening. 4 rows of weft twining in black/white, red/blue, black/white.\nUpper: 4 rows of weft twining in red/blue; 8 sections with slits as with lower; 7 rows of weft twining in red/blue, blue/white, red/blue and then plainweave with brown weft turned under.\nFlatweave: Dovetail tapestry weave with paired threads; 10 pairs per inch. 8 colours: dark red, red, yellow, dark green, light green, dark blue, blue, white. Lower edge: 1 double row of weft twining and then broad and narrow bands of pattern. Half a band on a dark blue ground with stepped diamonds containing a cross. Complete band of the same design on red, dark blue, and then red grounds. These are separated by 3 narrow bands of interlocking blocks of colour.\nCentral area: formed by 5 rows of red/blue weft twining running in the same direction to give a diagonal stripe which changes direction in the centre. 5cm band of interlocking blocks of colour with the outer 5cm on each side worked in alternating blocks of twining - vertical soumak. 6 rows of weft twining in red/blue (as before). The threads used for these bands of red/blue twining form a square braid which loops at intervals to form fastening on the right side.\nUpper panel: red ground with stepped diamonds enclosing a cross, arranged in diagonal bands of colour. 1 double row of weft twining in red/blue.\nDesign: \nLower face - field: dark blue ground with a central red and blue rosette set in a square that has a horn protruding from the centre of each side. Within the square, framing the rosette, are reciprocal green/white horns. Above and below the square are an octagon with a small white diamond within an 8-pointed star. On either side of the square are 2 vertical bars, each divided by a horizontal bar and each ending with an arrowhead. The field is decorated with white serrated eaves and many tiny geometric motifs including 4 small octagons.\nUpper face: there are slight differences in colour and this face includes 4 pairs of small octagons.\nInner border: red ground with alternating octagons and double-horned motifs in all colours.\nOuter border: white ground; possibly a variation on the leaf and wine-glass pattern.\nBand between the pile faces and the flatweave: dark blue ground with the double-horned motif as with the inner.",
