At the end of the table slip on the wire clamps the same distance apart as the width of the race course, on to which the untearable perforated tapes fit.\nSee that the square block under the handle moves freely in the rectangular slot, and that the race course and housing are in a perfectly straight line.\nEmploy as little tension as possible.  Do not fold the cloth, creases prevent the horses running properly.\nPlace the horses on the track with their hind legs touching the sewn end, and turn the handle at the opposite end of the race course, when the horses will be found to move forward.  The correct tension will be quickly found by tightening or lossening the elastic springs by means of the perforated tapes, which allow the game to be played on a table of any length.  If played on a table of exceptional length and the perforated tapes will not reach the wire clamps, a pieces of string fastened into the last hole of each tape and looped round the clamp will overcome the difficulty.\n\nRULES OF THE GAME\n\nThe horses having been placed in a straight line, players should stake on which ever one they fancy, one of the players acting as Banker, and should offer odds of:- with 5 horses running 4-1, and so on, the staking sheet being placed at the starting end of the track.  Should a horse fall over a fence, the player turning the handle (who should not watch the race, and if necessary be blindfolded) must slop and have it removed from the sosurce and then continue the race.\nThe horse which first passes the finishing line is the winner.\n\nSWEEPSTAKES\n\nPlayers each pay an agreed number of chips into a pool and toss for the choice of horse and position; the winning horse takes half the pool, the second two thirds of what is left, and the third horse the balance.  In the event of three horses not finishing the course, the winner still takes half the pool, the unclaimed share or shares being added to the next race.\nOnlookers if they so wish, may back any respective horse, or horses; one of the onlookers should act as Banker.\nOther methods of determining the odds will occur to players.  Should, for example, one particular horse will more frequently than others, the odds against it should be reduced.",
