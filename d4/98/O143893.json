Her we see three dancers making up and preparing for a performance. The figures in the scene have not been conclusively identified, but the foreground figure is probably Lydia Lopokova (a principal dancer with Diaghilev's 'Ballet Russes') in the costume of Columbine for the ballet Carnaval. The flounced dress was decorated with a pattern of cherries around the hems, but Knight has followed her usual practice of rendering her subject more simply and without extraneous detail. Her real subject here is the contrast between the shadowy interior and the bold pattern created by the tiered flounces of the dancer's dress.",
