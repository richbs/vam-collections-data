These boots are made for the left and right foot.  Howwever, until 1900, many women continued to wear straights (shoes which were not shaped to distinguish between left and right so that they could be worn on either foot).\n\nDesign & Designing\nThis pair of boots is almost identical to an image of the elastic-sided boot which is illustrated in the shoe designer/manufacturer J. Sparkes Hall's prospectus for the Great Exhibition of 1851 under the title 'Patent Elastic Articles for the Feet'. The elastic-sided boot was patented by J. Sparkes Hall of No.308 Regent Street in 1837 as a result of experiments made with india rubber cloth. By 1850, techniques for making the elastic gussets had much improved, although the elastic on the examples from the Great Exhibition has now perished.\n\nPeople\nJ. Sparkes Hall presented his prototypes for elastic-sided boots to Queen Victoria. In his prospectus he claimed that she 'walks in them daily and thus gives the strongest proof of the value she attaches to the invention'.",

They were made of fragile  materials such as ribbed silk although leather ankle boots were also becoming more and more fashionable.  Many women protected their boots from the dirt and damp by wearing overshoes known as pattens or clogs.  The overshoe was usually flat with a square toe cap to match the shoes and had  leather straps for fastening.  Ankle boots went out of fashion during the 1880s.\nThe square toe became popular in about 1825.  The fashion for square toes lasted until the 1870s when broad and rounded toes were favoured by both men and women.  By the 1880s pointed toes were in fashion",
