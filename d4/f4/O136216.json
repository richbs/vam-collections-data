He exhibited seven works at the RA between 1836 and 1855, 28 at the BI 1828-63, and 194 at the Society of British Artists between 1833 and 1870. He painted mainly landscapes. \n\nBetween 1839 and 1869 Pyne recorded his paintings in a series of account books, now kept at the National Art Library. This painting is probably number 179; \"The Menai Straits\". The location of the painting has been identified as a romanticised view of Port Dinorwig (Y Felin Heli), which is situated in the county of Gwynedd opposite the Moel y don in North Wales. This peaceful landscape is a very romanticised version of how the landscape would have looked in 1846 when this painting is dated. In this composition Pyne has left out a stone quarry that was built along the foreshore in 1839-41 and a tramway that ran between the quarry and the quay. This shows the artist making a conscious decision to include elements to create a composition that would appeal to a mid-nineteenth century audience.",

When E.413-2007 was acquired the V&A had four other Oil Paintings by James Baker Pyne in the collection.\n\nHistorical significance: Extract from Parkinson, Ronald, <u>Catalogue of British Oil Paintings 1820-1860</u>.  Victoria & Albert Museum, HMSO, London, 1990.  p. 234.\n\n\u201cBorn Bristol 5 December 1800. Articled to a legal attorney; taught himself painting. Exhibited seven works at the RA between 1836 and 1855, 28 at the BI 1828-63, and 194 at the SBA 1833-70 (elected Member 1842, and later Vice-President). Subjects principally landscapes, mainly river and lake scenes; his style was much influenced by J M W Turner. Travelled in Switzerland and Italy 1846, and Germany and Italy 1851. Published \u2018Windsor, With Its Surrounding Scenery\u2019 nd [1838-40], \u2018The English Lake District (Manchester 1853), and \u2018The Lake Scenery of England\u2019 (1859). There are also several drawings and watercolours in the V&A collections. Died 29 July 1870; his studio sale was at Christie\u2019s 25 February 1871.\u201d\n\nBetween 1839 and 1869 Pyne recorded his paintings in a series of account books which are now in the National Art Library (pressmarks 86.AA.15 and 86.AA.16). In a reply to a letter of enquiry from the previous owner of the painting from 3rd May 1984 Lionel Lambourne, Assistant Keeper, Department of Paintings wrote: \n\n\u201cThere are six or so paintings measuring 36 x 24 (inches) by Pyne, but the only two which seem to correspond in any way with your painting are in 1846. The others are Italian or German scenes.\n\n\u201c162 The Ferry at Portmaddock\u201d (but Pyne specifies a rainbow not present in your work)\n\n\u201c179 The Menai Straits\u201d.\n\nA letter to the previous owner from Mair Lees of the North Wales Tourism Council stated: \u201cHaving read your letter and studied the photo of your painting we think it is a view of Port Dinorwig (Y Felin Heli) opposite Moel y don and looking North East.\u201d\n\nPort Dinorwig (Y Felin Heli) is situated in the county of Gwynedd opposite Moel y don, which is a flat coastal area of Anglesey. A paddle tug accompanies a boat into the distance. This peaceful scene is a very romanticised version of what the landscape would have looked like in 1846. Port Dinorwig was an industrial port through which the slate of the Dinorwig quarry at Llanberis was shihpped. In 1839-41 a stone quarry was built along the foreshore and a tramway constructed in 1824 running from the quarry, situated seven miles inland, was extended to run along the quay. This shows the artist making a conscious decision to include only elements to  create a pleasant landscape that would appeal to the public. Wales is a recurring theme in Pyne\u2019s work. Being based in Bristol, James Baker Pyne could easily travel to Wales to paint scenes such as the Menai Straits. This interest in Welsh scenery also follows the example of artists such as Richard Wilson (1752-1807) and Thomas Danby (1818-1886) who popularised Welsh landscapes through their paintings.  \n\n This painting was not exhibited at the Royal Academy but Pyne showed a number of similar works depicting the British Landscape from 1836 including <i>Morning \u2013 Windsor Castle from the Thames</i> (no. 473, exhibited 1836); <i>Nightingale Valley, Clifton</i> (no. 239, exhibited 1838); <i>A hostel at Castle Upnor, on the Medway</i> and <i>Sandwich, Kentish Coast</i> (nos. 253 and 1163, both exhibited 1841). He exhibited almost exclusively at the Royal Society of British Artists, from 1841 when he became a member. He was later elected the society\u2019s vice president. Pyne\u2019s choice to exhibit the majority of his works at the Royal Society of British Artists reflects his commitments there as the Vice President. It is not clear whether this painting was exhibited at the Royal Society.",
