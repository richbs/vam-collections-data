H B Murray Bequest. \n\n<b>Literature:</b> Reynolds 1952, p. 90; Reynolds 1959, no. 19; Foskett 1963, p. 82; Foskett 1972, vol. I, p. 227, vol. n, pl. 67, no. 189; Murdoch 1978, p. 288, fig. 32; <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p.13; Murdoch 1981, pp. 160-2, fig. 176; Reynolds 1988, p.84, fig.48. \n\nThis is the miniature which in 1935 established P Cross, rather than Paolo Carandini or Pen elope Cleyn, as the artist who used the Simple Roman initials <i>PC</i> as his signature. At this date only a very small group of miniatures with these initials was known, all dating from about the 1660s or 1670s. On the subsequent history ofp Cross and his relation to 'Lawrence Crosse', see the biographical preface to this section and the literature there cited. On the stylistic character of <i>William Gore</i> and its relation to the other early works by Peter Cross, see entry for Cat. No. 163 [P.11-1915]. \n\nWilliam Gore was presumably Willem Goeree (1635-1711), the son of a distinguished theologian and physician of Middelburg and the father of Jan Goeree (1670-1731), the engraver. Willem, whose early studies were interrupted by his father's death in c.1643, became known principally as a bibliophile and book-dealer in Amsterdam. His publications include important works of biblical history and ecclesiology, but earlier in his career, <i>c.</i> 1670, he may have been better known for his interests in painting. Cross here calls him 'pictor'. The British Library Catalogue of Printed Books credits him with <i>Anweisung zu der Practic oder Handlung der allgemeinen MahlerKunst [Instruction in the Practice or Execution of the General Art of Painting]</i>, Hamburg 1678, translated from the Dutch by J Lange. The Dutch text translated by Lange was, according to Long, (l) Goeree's <i>Inleydinge tot de algemeene Teyken-Konst [Introduction to the General Art of Drawing]</i>, after 'Gerhard of Brugge' . Gore himself brought out the English translation of the latter in 1674, one of the key works of the English literature of art in the third quarter of the seventeenth century. \n\n1 MS note in departmental files.\" ",
