The success of their affordable, youthful designs enabled them to open a small shop in Abingdon Road in Kensington the following year. Many of London\u2019s fashionable new boutiques catered only for well-off customers (Mary Quant\u2019s Bazaar, for example), but Biba attracted glamorous pop stars, bohemian aristocrats and impoverished students alike. In April 1966, the American news magazine Time published a special edition celebrating \u2018London: The Swinging City\u2019. It named Biba as \u2018the most In shop for gear\u2019.\n\nIn contrast to the futuristic styles and space age brightness of some sixties clothing, Hulanicki\u2019s designs were inspired by the past. She created romantic, decadent garments for women swept up in the growing craze for vintage dresses. This printed cotton trouser suit combines a traditional fabric with a contemporary silhouette: a cabbage-rose print reminiscent of a furnishing fabric is used for a sharply tailored jacket paired with flared trousers.\n\nPetra Siniawski, a leading actress in musicals at the time, bought this suit in 1974. By this time Biba had taken over the giant department store, formerly Derry & Tom\u2019s, on Kensington High Street. Siniawski had just finished appearing at the Shaftesbury Theatre, London, as the character Anita in West Side Story. 'It was a favourite outfit', she recalls, and she wore it when she accompanied her agent to a Shirley Bassey concert at the Royal Albert Hall.",
