The Beringer Sisters were not the first sister act to have played Romeo and Juliet, having been preceded by the American Cushman sisters Charlotte and Susan, who had made a hit with the play in 1846.  In his book A Poor Player: The Story of a Failure Harold Hannyngton Child recalls walking on in the 1896 matin\u00e9e, commenting that: 'ugly clumsy Charlotte Cushman can never have been a patch on Esm\u00e9 Beringer as Romeo; and the Juliet of Miss Vera Beringer at seventeen was a girl in love, not a woman flirting.'",
