The elections took place between the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and the reunification of East and West Germany.\n\nThe graphic designer Anke Feuchtenberger used a radical design vocabulary for this poster formed of illustration and comic elements. She engages elements originating out of the GDR tradition of poster drawing, which up until then were solely used for poster advertising in a cultural context. Feuchtenberger was the only designer to infuse this design tradition with a political content and the poster goes far beyond the propaganda platitudes of the designers employed by the Social Unity Party (the ruling party in the communist GDR). \n\nThe posters of the Independent Women's Union can be seen as an attenpt to create a stand-alone, new and free kind of political poster for the GDR.\n\nThe political message on the poster states: 'Alle Frauen sind mutig! stark! sch\u00f6n! - Auch f\u00fcr Frauen und Kinder eine sorgenfreie Zukunft in dem Europ\u00e4ischen Haus', which means 'all women are courageous! strong! beautiful! - a carefree future in this European house also for women and children'.\n\nThe German Independent Women's Union was founded on the 17th of February 1990. The Union was at first a reservoir for different women's movements, with the intention of distancing themselves from the state-directed 'Demokratischer Frauenbund Deutschlands' ('Democratic Women's Federation of Germany'). In September 1991 the Union changed into an association (society), which eventually disbanded in 1998. The political impact of the party remained limited, nevertheless, some of their election posters are of particular importance.",
