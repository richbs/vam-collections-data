Beneath the spout is a projecting knop, at the rear of the rim are two loops froming the hinge of the now missing lid.  The ring handle, shaped like an elongated oval with flattened sides, is topped by the moulded figure of a bird.  The figures of rampant confronted lions are engraved and inlaid  either side of the rear of the wall.Each pair merges to share the same head, moulded in relief and pierced.\n\nA trumpet-shaped foot spreads out to a flat base.  It is faceted with six downward-pointing pentagons imbricated with six triangular facets rising from the base.  On the longer facets, two designs are alternately engraved.  One motif is of ducks or wild geese (?) seen in profile, facing left, on a foliate ground.  The other is a foliate scroll with six tangent discs and a pointed lotus bud.  Simple scrolls fill the panels on the triangular facets.  \n\nThe flat rim of the well is decorated with an (originally silver, now black composition) inlaid epigraphic inscription on a ring-matted ground which is now hardly discernible.\n\nPatina: pale yellow with black composition incrustations",
