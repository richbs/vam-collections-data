She has won a number of prizes for drawing, including the RCA Drawing Prize in 1984. \n\nThis DVD, Drawing Your Desire, is a performance work - it records the artist leaving temporary tracks in an outside environment. It was selected for the 2006 Jerwood Drawing Prize exhibition. Fo\u00e1 has described the 'desire' lines of the title as \"tracks formed from people's footsteps across grassy areas in urban and countryside locations. They denote the direction of passage preferred over the paved (designed) pathways.\" Her drawings are made in response to public spaces where she leaves temporary marks whilst passing through. The drawings are responses to the place itself, and she says that they are a combination of \"Trace, Graffiti and Traffic\", from which she derives the term 'Traffiti' to describe them. These drawings are directly inspired by seminal environmental works such as Richard Long's A Line Made By Walking (1967) and performance pieces such as Vito Acconci's Following Piece (1969) and Sophie Calle's Suite V\u00e9nitienne (1980).",
