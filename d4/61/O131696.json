With an open back consisting of three arches on turned (fruitwood?) columns (two full, and two halved), with three turned acorns (softwood?) on the lower back rail and two (oak?) on the top rail, (probably all replacements). The deep upper rail of the back with three arches carved with low relief leaf ornament. The rear stiles are carved at the top with inward facing scroll finials, and chamfered between the seat rail and lower rail of the back, and bear on their front faces a split turning, nailed in place. The frame of rectangular section throughout, save for two sections of bobbin turning on each front leg, with two side stretchers each side and a low stretcher at front and back. The front and side seat rails with an ogee moulded lower edge. The sunken seat tray (formed by a single board) is a replacement, as are the lower back rail, back seat rail and back stretcher, all of which were presumably removed to facilitate the replacement of the seat board, thus allowing the sides to be splayed apart.\n\nThe frame with a dark stain overall.\n\nThe rectangular cushion with inset corners at the front is covered with a sage green cloth (modern velvet? with piping, over linen), with two embroidered canvas-work bands (apparently 17th century date), worked with floral and grape bunch designs in blue, red, green and yellow wools. Cushion: 8cm x 42cm x 35cm\n\nBack right leg with glue repair.",
