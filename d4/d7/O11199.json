These range from covering floors and windows to making bags, boxes and even umbrellas. Papermaking has a long and illustrious history in Korea: that of the Koryo (918\u20131392) and Choson (1392\u20131910) dynasties won the praise of even the Chinese, who were not usually inclined to prize foreign goods. \n\nThis octagonal box was made by a Korean artist working in the paper-decorating tradition. Its skeleton is of wood, over which have been pasted a few layers of white paper and finally the coloured papers that form the design. A final lacquer coating acts as a sealant and protector. \n\nThe base of the box is divided into sections. Black paper cuts decorate the lid and sides of the box. The circular emblems interspersed with the paper cuts on the side of the box derive from Taoism.",
