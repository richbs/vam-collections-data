They were originally made of twisted metal, as the name implies, and were used as indications of rank in Celtic times.  They survived as part of the traditional jewellery in a number of places, including Syria. \n\nThe design of this torque, with different wires twisted together and linked by a hook at the front, and long chain pendants, is typical of those made in Syria and Iraq.  The pendants usually end in coins, but this example has discs of filigree in an unusual swirling pattern.  Torques were mainly worn by the nomadic Bedouin.",
