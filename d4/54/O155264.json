The edges have been turned over and stitched in place.  There is a border along the bottom: a pink blossom with red outlined on striped stem facing to the lower left with a group of 3 small yellow and mauve blossoms.  This continues part way up the sides.  There is a narrow border either side of the bottom section with 2 red outlined buds alternating with 2 pale outlined buds.\n\nThe main pattern is a series of diagonal lines from lower right to upper left.  These are chevron lines in green and dark blue.\nThere are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: white ground with an angled stem, pink blossom and buds outlined with red with blue/green leaves, pointing down to the right alternating with downward pointing bunch of green, orange and beige flowerheads on a pink stem.\n[2] wider stripes in two designs: [a] pink vase, central pink blossom, 2 flowers with blue details, 3 blossoms with red outlines and 2 pale flowers alternating with a white vase, pair of large pink leaves, small central pink flower and 2 carnations - all 3 outlined with red.
