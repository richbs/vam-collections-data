            "public_access_description": "Lez Brotherston (born 1961) trained at the Central School of Art and Design, graduating in 1984. He is an influential and innovative designer of film, theatre and opera, and is especially known for his work for dance, particularly for Matthew Bourne's companies, Adventures in Motion Pictures and New Adventures. He has designed Bourne's productions of Highland Fling, an up-dating of Les Sylphides set in a Glasgow council flat, Cinderella, which took place during the London Blitz, The Car Man, based on Bizet's opera Carmen, Edward Scissorhands, and, famously, Swan Lake with male swans, for which he won three awards.\n\nGraham Greene began writing Brighton Rock in 1936, it was published in 1938. The novel was adapted for the stage in 1942 and produced at the Garrick Theatre with Richard Attenborough playing Pinkie, Dulcie Gray as Rose and Hermione Baddeley as Ida. In 1947 it was turned into a film, directed by John Boutling with Attenborough reprising his stage role. In the early 1960s, Graham Greene gave his blessing to composer John Barry to write a musical theatre version, but due to difficulties with the film's producers, this project never came to fruition. It took 40 years for Barry to fulfil his ambition of writing the musical. Brighton Rock was given its world premiere at the Almeida Theatre, London, on 20 September 2004.\n\nA designer will create a 'bible' to contain the information required by costumiers and set builders. This example gives an insight into Brotherston's working methods. The costume designs are colour copies of his original drawings, with reproductions of 1940s fashion catalogues and fashion plates, as an aid to the makers. Brotherston always focuses on the costumes not the wearers, using a few standard poses for his figures, drawing the faces in profile and giving them all similar features. \n\nThe design bible also includes photographs of the set model. Brotherston does not produce set designs on paper as he prefers to create models and develop the set in three dimensions.  At the front of the bible are a series of photographs of the finished model which shows how one basic setting can be adapted to suggest different locations. The design bible also contains photographs of the cast, a copy of the script and groundplans for the Almeida Theatre stage area.\n\nDesign bibles are a unique insight into the design process and the eventual realisation of a production.",
