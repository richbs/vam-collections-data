Originally thought to have been part of a relatively small number of silks surviving, many more related pieces have been identified in more recent years both in western Europe and Russia.  \n\nOne silk in the group from a church in Huy, France has a contemporatry inscription on the back in Sogdian, the language of a people who lived in the region of Bhokara (Western Asia). They share features which differ from those of other contemporary Near Eastern and Far Eastern silks, both technically and with regard to the poorly dyed, strong, coarse threads (the dyes may have been Chinese). \n\nThe influence of  Sasanian (a pre-Islamic dynasty in Persia, now Iran) art, is evident in this example: the face-to-face lions in circles, as well as the running animals below, are familiar from the repetoire of designs of textiles from many centres in the Near and Far East.",
