The painted mother-of-pearl case is of the very highest quality - certainly fit for a king's use - and was probably made in France. Folding spectacles are mentioned in the advertisement of a French maker in 1745.  They are described as 'in the English style'.  It is likely that folding spectacles had been made for a decade or so before 1745, but there is no evidence that they were made during the lifetime of James II.\n\nA letter that accompanied the spectacles, written at the end of the 18th century, describes in detail how the case passed by gift from James's son, the Old Pretender, through several hands, until it came into the possession of a Mr Walker in 1770. By that time it must have been revered as a Jacobite relic by those who favoured the Stuart claim to the English throne.",

Late 17th century - - \u00a3125\n\n11 November 1969 memo, Thornton to Robinson, Digby & Charleston\nHe describes the glasses and case, said to have belonged to James II, which \"are accompanied by some 18th century documents authenticating them and, on the face of it, the tradition seems \"plausible\".  Thornton describes the case as \"a most charming object\" and assumes they are \"continental\".\n\n12 November 1969 response\nRobinson agrees that it is \"a very desirable acquisition\".  Digby finds it of interest as a \"Jacobite relic\".\n\n21 November 1969 Transit Room receipt\nrefers to the spectacle case, spectacles, a porcelain cane head and  4 documents (one document - the original 18th century letter is transcribed on the attached and is in the F & W catalogue entry - did the other 3 documents relate to the cane?? Where are they?)\n\n3 December 1969 letter, Thornton to Pigot\naccepts the spectacle case and cane top.  They are \"not only of considerable historic interest but are charming pieces in their own right\".  He enclosed photocopies of the documents.\n\n7 December 1969 response, Pigot\nthanks Thornton for the photocopies of the various documents as he is glad to have them \"for their family interest\".\n\n20 May 1970 memo, Ann Thomas to John Hardy & Gillie\nrequests that photos of the James II specs be sent to a Mr Fairbanks along with copies of \"the letters\" and a transcript of the letter of 1756.  Mr Fairbanks is with The City University\n[Spectacle case] Historical significance: Said to have belonged to James II - see letter W.5B-1970\n[Spectacles] Said to have belonged to James II, with the spectacle case, but the nose spectacles must date from about 1700-1725, rather later than the case.  As Jamed II died in exile in 1701 they are unlikely to have belonged to him.  They do not fit easily into the case with which they are associated.",
