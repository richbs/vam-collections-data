It is a square shape with the wringers mounted at the back.  The tub is square and at the centre of its base is a spindle which turns but not by a handle or mechanically.  The handle, mounted on the right, is connected to the lower wringer.  When it is turned, the wringer turns.  Attached to the lower right back is a drainage hose pipe of grey soft plastic with a white plastic nozzle.  It does not actually drain from the tub.\nThe front of the tub is decorated with two rectangular decals printed in pink and blue on white to give the title and a floral design.  The base is moulded to show the feet extending at the corners.\n[Box] Cardboard box printed in colours to show the title and washing instructions.  Some words have been obliterated which suggests that the box may be a copy of a real product.\n[Box] Cardboard printed in colours to show both illustrations and photographs together with the maker's details, safety standards trademark, and title in three languages.  The age is listed as 3years on the bottom and 4+ on the sides.\n[Insert] Cardboard covered on one side with white paper.
