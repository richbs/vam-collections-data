This one was originally in the collection of Sir Elijah Impey and Lady Impey, who commissioned over 300 pictures in Calcutta between 1777 and 1782. Sir Elijah was the first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Fort William. He was a man of great intellect and wide-ranging interests. The Impeys were passionately interested in the flora and fauna of India and formed a private menagerie at their house, where they assembled birds and animals. From 1777 they employed three Indian artists to paint their collection.  One of them was the Hindu artist Bhawani Das, who made this picture around 1780.",

Archer [1955] pp.94-5, figs.44-7; Welch [1978] nos.6-9). In this sensitively painted study of an isolated branch the artist is as far as he could be from the poetically stylized mango trees of traditional Indian painting, no.72.\nMildred Archer assisted by Graham Parlett, Company Paintings.
