The techniques of enamel painting were first perfected on the Continent in the early 17th century by goldsmiths such as Jean Petitot.\n\nMaterials & Making\nEnamel is a type of glass coloured by metal oxides and fused to a metal base by firing in a kiln.  Each colour has a different melting point and so must be applied and fired  individually. To achieve a work of sophistication many applications and firings are required, and careful calculations are needed to avoid accidents in the firing process.\n\nPeople\nLike most early 18th-century English miniaturists Gervase Spencer taught himself the art of painting in watercolour on ivory; originally he had been a footman.  As enamels were fashionable at this time Spencer also learnt this complex art, apparently without any lessons.\n\nOwnership & Use\nThe memoirs of Spencer's fellow miniaturist Samuel Finney describe how clients often ordered a portrait both in miniature (watercolour on ivory) and in enamel.  Unlike miniatures, enamels were richly coloured and tough and durable.  This enamel is expensively set with diamonds.  The frame has a series of holes at the top and bottom so that it could be sewn to a ribbon, and is slightly curved so it can be worn comfortably on the wrist.",
