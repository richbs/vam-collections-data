The whole body was bound, leaving only the head free to move which rendered the child warm, still and kept them out of harm's way.

In fact the importance of childbirth in the life of a Renaissance family is emphasized by the very density of the material culture associated with it. Childbirth attained a significance for a variety of reasons. The most critical was the drastic decline in the population caused by the plague of 1348 and its recurring outbreaks over the next two centuries. Most objects associated with birth were both decorative and utilitarian.This decorative band was the last to be applied after the child had been wrapped in plain bands. Swaddling kept the baby warm, still and out of harm's way. By the beginning of the seventeenth century babies were being swaddled for less time as it was considered unhygeneic.",
