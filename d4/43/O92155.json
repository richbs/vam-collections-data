Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hard-wearing. Above all, they had to have the means for attaching a cord. Netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated being the katabori (shape carving), a three-dimensional carving, such as this one in the form of a persimmon.\n\nFrom the 18th century onwards, netsuke were increasingly signed with the carver\u2019s name. This example is signed \u2018Mitsuhiro\u2019. Ohara Mitsuhiro (1810-1875) was one of the two great 19th-century netsuke carvers from Osaka, a centre of netsuke making. At the age of 17, Mitsuhiro went to live with a family in Osaka who dealt with ivory and made plectra for the shamisen, a stringed musical instrument. There Mitsuhiro learned to carve using ivory waste and was ultimately adopted by the master of the shop. He became an independent carver ten years later. Mitsuhiro is well known for his minutely detailed carvings of animal, vegetable and figural subjects. He worked mostly in ivory, often staining it subtly in red, as he did with this persimmon.",
