His studio, with a focus on the creation of artistic wares and the tireless experiements of De Morgan himself to reproduce various colours and glazes, was regarded as the antithesis of the large, impersonal, industrialised factories. De Morgan was greatly influenced by Iznik ceramics, and aimed to perfect the vibrant turquoises and blues of such wares in what he termed his 'Persian' style, as demonstrated in the colours and design of this dish. \n\nDe Morgan moved his pottery several times during his career to meet the changing demands of his life and work, first at Chelsea (1872-82), then at Merton Abbey (1882-88) and finally at Fulham (1888-1898) after which De Morgan played an increasingly distant part in the company. This dish, although unmarked and undated, was probably made during the early years of the Fulham period when De Morgan produced some of his most exciting designs.\n\nDe Morgan was also associated with the Arts and Crafts movement in Britain producing ceramics for William Morris",
