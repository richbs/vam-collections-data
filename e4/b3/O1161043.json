The fan expels 405 litres of cool, smooth and uninterrupted air every second. In addition to the quality of its technological invention, the Dyson Air Multiplier(tm) fan is an aesthetically appealing object. It comes in two sizes (10 and 12 inches) as well as three different colour schemes (iron/blue, white/silver, silver/iron). A table and a tower fan model were introduced some month later. The fan is powered by a motor and air speed can be adjusted with dimmer-switch control.  The weight of the motor at its base allows the fan to be tilted easily. In comparison to similar products the Dyson Air Multiplier(tm) fan has en improved desk-top stability. The advantage of having no blades and hence no grille makes the fan save to use and simple to clean. But most important, drawing surrounding air into the airflow results in approximately 15 times more energy efficiency.",
