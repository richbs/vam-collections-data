On the obverse (front) is a shield of St George within a wreath, with the legend 'The Commonwealth of England'. On the reverse are the shields of England and Ireland, with the words 'God with us, 1653'. The substitution of coins with the arms of England and Ireland for the familiar coins bearing the monarch's head was perhaps the most obvious change in official imagery following the Civil War of 1642-1646.\n\nMaterials &  Making\nThis sovereign  was hammered into shape in a mould. At a later date coins were struck from metal dies engraved with the design in reverse. Gold, being a relatively soft medal, could be given an image simply by hammering.",
