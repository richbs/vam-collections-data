            "public_access_description": "This figurine is one of several wax figurines executed by Agatha Walker in the 1920s, mostly of actors and actresses in character in successful London productions.. The 19th century saw a craze for ceramic figurines of performers and Agatha Walker attempted to revive this tradition with her limited edition sculptures,  modelled from life in plaster and coated with a fine wax layer which was then coloured.  In 1931 Agatha Walker's wax figures were exhibited at the Fine Art Society.\n\nThis represents Edith Evans (1888-1976) as Florence Nightingale in a new play The Lady with a Lamp by the New Zealand author Reginald Berkeley.  It opened at London's Arts Theatre on 5th January 1929 and after ten perfomances transferred to the Garrick Theatre on 24th January, where it stayed until the middle of June, achieving a run of 164 performances.  Edith Evans made her first professional stage appearance in 1912 and she was already acknowledged as a star by the time she was cast as Florence Nightingale.  Agatha Walker made a companion wax of Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies as Lady Herbert of Lea, who was by all accounts a perfect foil to Edith Evans in this production.",
