The beak is broad. The underside of the bird is smooth, except for the long, flat soles of the feet. The stone is pierced with a string-hole from the breast to the tail.",

The goose or hamsa figures prominently in Hindu sacred texts (it is, for example, the vehicle of the god Brahma) but is also an important symbol for Buddhists, representing the propagation of Buddhism.",
