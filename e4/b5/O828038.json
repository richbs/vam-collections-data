A lithograph is a picture made by printing from a flat surface (traditionally stone, now often a metal plate), on which the artist draws or paints the original design with a greasy substance like chalk. The surface is next prepared, moistened and inked; the greasy printing ink adheres to the design, which is then printed onto a sheet of paper.  To make a colour lithograph, a separate printing surface is required for each colour: this chromolithograph was printed from no fewer than 24 colour blocks.\n\nTrading\n\nThe trademark product of A. & F. Pears was its transparent amber soap, which was developed and promoted as a great improvement on the harshness of contemporary soaps by the company's founder, Andrew Pears, at the turn of the 18th century.  In the mid-19th century, the company took on a new partner, Thomas J. Barratt to stave off fierce competition and to improve sales performance.  He devised a series of expensive and original publicity schemes, which involved reproducing celebrated paintings. Such 'artistic' advertising appeared in the UK in the 1880s. Barratt was particularly keen to use the work of Royal Academicians to add kudos and respectability to his product and so target middle-income customers. He also promoted art through the pages of Pears Annual (published 1890-1921, and price six pence until 1915).This image appeared in the Pears Annual in 1901. Presentation plates were given away as a separate package with the Annual. \n\nSubjects Depicted\n\nIn December 1899, Thomas J. Barratt (1842-1914) of A. & F. Pears bought an oil painting by John Ernest Breun which was a copy of an oil painting made in 1785 by Jean-Baptiste Greuze entitled \u2018A Boy with an Apple\u2019. He reproduced it as a print to use in his publicity material.",
