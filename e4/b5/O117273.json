He provided a skech for his specification of a light but strong chair, to be covered in green leather, the traditional colour for upholstery in the House of Commons, with brass nails. The chair became the standard model for the lobbies, refreshment rooms, libraries and offices of the House of Commons and a slightly different version was produced for the House of Lords. By 1870 examples of the House of Commons chair were in use in other public buildings, including the South Kensington Museum, now the Victoria and Albert Museum. The Museum Boardroom was furnished with a large set of these chairs, including this example. They were recovered using Pugin's original specification in 1974 and others of the set remain in use.\n\nGillow & Co., a large and successful firm of furniture makers, was commissioned to make furniture for the House of Commons from 1851. Their stamp is on the underside of the seat frame of this chair and this suggests that they made examples of Pugin's House of Commons design for other commissions.",
