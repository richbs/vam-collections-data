ISBN 0 7 148 8067 1\nBaker, Malcolm and Richardson, Brenda, eds. <u>A Grand Design : The Art of the Victoria and Albert Museum.</u> London: V&A Publications, 1997. 431 p., ill. ISBN 1851773088.\nThis dish by Bernard Leach, purchased for \u00a35 (reduced from \u00a37.50) from an exhibition at the British Institute of Industrial Art, is now ranked as a masterpiece by one of the twentieth century's greatest artist-potters. It combines old English earthenware techniques, particularly those of Thomas Toft and other seventeenth-century Staffordshire potters (cat. 128), with a \"tree of life\" motif from a Chinese Han Dynasty tomb decoration that Leach may have seen during a visit in 1916. Leach commented that the design \"may be seen as symbolic,\" and, though not explicit about his interpretation of the motif, he reused it many times.\nThe Museum's Circulation Department acquired this dish in 1923 not as a work of art in its own right, but as \"a very interesting revival of an old technique\" at a time when slipware was arousing great interest among collectors and museums. The technique was considered the true English style, uncontaminated by the foreign influences perceived in porcelain and delftware, and was thought to demonstrate a \"racy vitality\" that the sterile perfection of industrialised products could not match.\nLeach set up his workshop in St. Ives in 1920 after working for ten years in Japan, where he studied pottery under the master Ogata Kenzan. Leach's aim was to \"re-create\" the English pottery tradition that he believed had been swept away by industrialisation. He also wished to introduce the techniques and styles of Chinese ceramics of the Tang and Song periods, which he regarded as the highest achievements in the potter's art (see cat. 108).\n\nOLIVER WATSON",
