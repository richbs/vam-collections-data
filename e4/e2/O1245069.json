Potter (1866-1943) wanted to put the young daughter of the Vicar of Newlands into a tale: a tale about a hedgehog seemed most appropriate as Lucie spent time playing with Tiggy (Potter's hedgehog) when her parents visited the Potters during their stay at Lingholm near Derwentwater in the Lake District.\n\nThis miniature post box was given to Lucie when she was a child by Potter. Potter would provide Lucie with miniature letters, most often from characters in her tales, addressed to each other. These could be inserted into the postbox.\n\nBeatrix Potter (1866-1943) is one of the world's best-loved children's authors and illustrators. She wrote the majority of the twenty-three original Peter Rabbit books between 1901 and 1913. The Tale of Peter Rabbit (Frederick Warne, 1902) is her most famous and best-loved tale.",
