He studied at Takaoka Kogei Gakko (Takaoka Technical High School, founded in 1894) and was taught by Uchijima Shihei. His work was first accepted into the Teiten exhibition in 1933. He joined the teaching staff of his alma mater in 1941. In the postwar period he was a regular contributor to the Japan Traditional Art Crafts Exhibition (Nihon Dento Kogeiten). He was appointed a Living National Treasure in 1989. He died on 25 November 2001 at the age of 93. He was highly regarded for his metal inlay work. The geometric style he used consistently throughout his career has a strongly Art Deco quality to it.",
