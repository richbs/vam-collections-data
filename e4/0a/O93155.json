The handsome figures belong to Iran's Turkish-speaking upper class. Verses on the exterior describe unrequited passion for young men or women of high rank.\n\nIn many Islamic societies, scenes containing humans and animals were a common type of decoration in non-religious contexts. The source of this imagery was usually poetry, the most highly esteemed form of secular literature. \n\nLuxury copies of narrative poems were often illustrated with fine paintings. The more familiar episodes were depicted on palace walls and objects. Love lyrics accompanied portrayals of beautiful young men and women. Odes in praise of the ruler inspired enthronement scenes. The recitation of poems at court was depicted, as were princely activities such as hunting and playing polo.",
