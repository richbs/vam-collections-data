It was originally devised for a window in St Michael's Church in Brighton. This incomplete version may have been made for the International Exhibition of 1862. Morris & Co.'s religious works, inspired by Medieval glazing programmes and were used widely by architects of the Gothic Revival movement to enhance their elaborate churches\n\nPeople\nThe scheme was designed by the artist Edward Burne-Jones (1833-1898), the most influential and prolific stained-glass designer of those who united with William Morris in 1861. Moving away from the heavy Gothic style which predominated at the time, the company aimed to fill a gap in the market for well-designed furniture and interior decoration. The company's commissions were primarily concerned with domestic interiors and in the 1860s non-ecclesiastical commissions for stained glass were still rare.\n\nMaterials & Making\nMorris & Co. were not technical innovators in stained-glass making, but they did lead a revolution in colour and design. This panel, like the firm's other early glass, is distinguished by its subtle colouring, delicate painting and an unusual amount of white glass. 'Colour, pure and sweet', Morris proclaimed, 'is the least you should ask for in a painted window'.Victorians admired stained glass because of its association with medieval churches and because it brought colour into the church interior. Stained glass was one of the first commercial products of the decorating firm of Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co. It because a successful product, both for churches and houses for that firm and for many others.",
