Vandermeulens Atelier (for whom the paper bags were made) Rotterdam, creates a range of art objects for use inside and outside the home.\n\nVan der Meulen developed his first 'bag' in 1993. The artist's concept of creating new objects out of reused materials is bought to stunning effect in these paper sacks. Both are formed out of large sheets of sturdy paper - originally colourful hoarding-size poster sheets - which are sewn down to the side and rolled over the top to make serviceable containers. Wittily the sacks could be used as 'waster-paper within and around them'. Equally they could be used as 'laundry bags', and were marked as such in Vandermeulens.",
