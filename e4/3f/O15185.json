The decorative scheme is divided into sections by  a series of thin lines. The vase dates from the 15th century, coinciding with the earlier phase of the Choson dynasty (1392-1910). This vase is classified as punch'ong ware. The term punch'ong is a contraction of a modern Korean term, punjang hoech'ong sagi, meaning 'green, powder-like dressing on a grey vessel'. Punch'ong wares were made during the 15th and 16th centuries. They are stonewares and are often decorated with white slip. Inlaid, incised and carved designs were particularly popular, but spontaneous, free-spirited motifs painted with brown iron oxide are also found.",
