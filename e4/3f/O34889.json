Flames rise from his four legs and an impression of forceful forward motion is conveyed by the dramatic foreshortening of the dragon's forequarters in the lower centre.\n\nColour: Blue, yellow, black\n\nThe dragon flying through dark clouds is painted in five directional colours, yellow, blue, white, red, and black, reflecting the ancient Chinese thought of ohaeng. Dragons are a traditional symbol of sovereign authority, water control, state protection, defence against evil spirits, and good auspice. They are therefore frequently portrayed in paintings. The dragon in this picture is painted in yellow. A yellow dragon symbolizes the middle of the universe or the king\u2019s power, since yellow indicates the centre among the five directional colours. When dragons are depicted along with clouds, it underlines a wish for rain.",
