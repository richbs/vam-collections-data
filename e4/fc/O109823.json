            "physical_description": "<b>W.25A/1-1954 (stool)</b> \n\nThe frame is made of walnut.  All four rails are tenoned into the legs and built up with ears consisting of blocks and shaped facings.  The original blocks were carved in with the facings (?they are all original?).  Triangular corner blocks, themselves with the corner cut out to accommodate the inside corner of each leg, re-enforce the frame.  These corner blocks seem to be made of walnut and are nailed on (?are they original or later?).  The rebates for the seat were cut out from the rails with a plane before the rails were joined to the legs; the rebate at the top of the legs is chiselled out.  \n\nA veneer in burr walnut is applied to the sides of the rails with a convex veneer on top.  Cut-out fretwork is applied over the veneer, including beadings at the top and bottom.  \n\nCramp marks are evident on the inside of all four rails \u2013 these most likely originate from securing the veneer and/or fretwork.  Unexplained nail holes are visible on the underside of the rails.  Plane marks are evident on the top face of the rails where the rebates are formed.  A 'I' is chiselled onto the frame of the stool using a short blunt chisel (the chisel used is different to that used to make the same numbering on the underside of the frames of the drop-in seat but is the same as the one used to apply 'II' to W.25B/1-1954).\n\n<b>W.25A/2-1954 (drop-in seat)</b> \n\n<b>Frame</b> \n[For the comments below, the front rail is taken to be beneath the drummer\u2019s legs]\n\nThe rails are oak.  The side rails are tenonned to the front and back rails. \n\nThe front and back rails have had some sort of previous use, hence lots of nail holes along the bottom and inside face of the back rail. However, it appears to be of the same vintage as the frame of W.25B/2-1954 -- perhaps a replacement, although certainly oxidized over time on the underside, in the same way as W.25B/2-1954 (remaining fresh where in contact with the main frame). \n\n<b>Foundation</b> \nPlain weave, probably linen, webbing with three thin white stripes (perhaps more complex?).  Three strips of webbing run from front to back and are interwoven with two strips that run from side to side.\n\nOxidised holes where the webbing was previously fixed to a frame are evident on the back end of the outer two vertical strips and the front end of the middle strip.\n\nThe yellow wool (worsted) plain weave cloth under the top cover might be the stuffing cover (maybe the original stuffing cover?). The embroidered cover may be lined with linen which seems to be different to either the tape or lining used on W.25B/2-1954.  The lining is sewn onto the cover.  A selvedge is evident on all edges (front, back and both sides) so it must be used in strips.  The selvedge on the back edge seems to be different to those on the other three, so may have been taken from a different canvas.\n\n<b>Covering fabric</b> \nComprises cross-stitch ground and flowers.  The figure is in tent stitch, some of which appears finer than others.",
