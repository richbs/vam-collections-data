In the late 1980s Ballen started documenting isolated white rural communities in South Africa who at that time were in the process of losing the privileges of apartheid which had provided them livelihoods and sustained their identity. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the work shifted and Ballen's subjects started to act out tableaux for the camera, creating images which are intriguing and disturbing in equal measure. These photographs - which appear to aestheticise scenes of poverty - disrupt a documentary reading of the image and provoke the viewer to consider the role of the sitter: exploited victim or consensual participant?",
