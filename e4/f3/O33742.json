The iridescent effect could be produced in various colours and green was the result of adding lead phosphate to the moulding compound. \n\nThe box was made by Halex Ltd, which was founded as British Xylonite in 1896 and opened its first factory in Walthamstow, East London, in 1897, where it pioneered the manufacture of celluloid in Britain. By the 1930s Halex Ltd was making a large variety of plastic personal goods including combs and toothbrushes, as well as household items like this box. Affordable products like this popularised high-style Art Deco and brought a taste of Hollywood glamour into ordinary British homes.",
