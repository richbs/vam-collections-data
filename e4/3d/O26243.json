Each player must be provided with 1 coloured counter to mark his place in the Game and 2 dozen fish.\n2.  A Pool is to be formed by each Player putting in 4 but if 6 or more play, 3 will be sufficient.\n3.  There is to be a Lord of the Game chosen by vote before whom the gane is to be placed in the middle of the table.- His office will be to move the marks and read the Anecdotes etc according to the numbers turned up.- He is not to spin, but nust be provided with 2 donzen fish and whoever falls into a Vice must pay 2  to the Lord, but whoever arrives at a Virtue must receive 1 from him (besides what are directed in the Game)----At the conclusion of the GAme he will be entitled to one third of the Pool for his trouble.\n4.  Spin for first player:  The highest to begin.  The first player is to place his mark on the number he turns up and the rest proceed in the same manner.\n5.  If two come to the same number he that was there first must move back to the place he left, and receive one from the last comer for resigning his place.\n6.  The number turned up at each spinning is to be added to that on which the mark stands:  thus if a player was at No. 5 and on his second spin turns up 4 he moves to 9.\n7.  Whoever arrives first at the Temple of Happiness No.45 wins the game and takes the Pool.  Should any player go beyond that number he must move as many back as he exceeds it, but may claim the privilege of not making up his fish at the end of the game.\n8.  The directions under the numbers in the book are only to be observed when turned up on the Tetotum  not  when directed to move from one number  to another.\n\nThe booklet is marked with :-  LONDON:  Printed by W Lewis, Finch Lane for E Wallis, 42 Skinner Street, Snow Hill\nAt the back is:-  W. Lewis, Printer, 21 Finch Lane, Cornhill.\n\nRules placement: in the centre; booklet",
