However the handle itself and the embellishment at the tip of the plinth are truly astounding examples of silver modelling. The handle is a wondrously intricate and accurate angler fish with needle-sharp teeth and a large gaping mouth, within which a pearl suspended on a line acts as bait. The swept back tail and body are delicately engraved with scales. The large eyes are ruby, enhancing the sense of glamour evoked by the gilding. At the tip of the plinth, acting as a retainer for the blade, is a reed bed with a gilt prey fish, echoing and balancing the visual effect of the handle. Ingeniously, the handle swivels on its silver support column for compact storage. This luxurious piece is beautifully sculptured yet retains a strong sense of functionality exemplified by the swivelling handle.",
