The back of cartouche form, with a central grotesque male mask set within a heart-shaped area formed by two scrolls carved with undulating vine-stem ornament, the scrolls resting on a shallow gadrooned plinth; and a double-scroll pediment containing a six-pointed star below a spear-tip finial, with a gadrooned moulding along the bottom of the pediment; the rear face of the back plain. The seat board of rectangular form, cut across the front corners, and with a tongue extending behind to receive the back tenon, with gadrooning along the sides and front edges. The design of the front support mirrors the back, but with two animal feet below, and with a carved freize above, with three rosettes alternating with opposed trefoil motifs; the rear face plain. The rear support has the same outline as the front, but is plain front and back.\n\nStretchers 3.8 wide\nDark stain overall\n\nLacks an obv wear or repairs.\nGesso and parcel gilt\nA single modern peg holds the back into the seat (ie loose)",

They were often  carved with fantastic monsters and grotesques, like this example which forms part of a set that belonged to the Steno family of Venice, whose emblem, a star, is  emblazoned on the crest. According to John Hungerford Pollen, writing in 1874, the Steno house \"remained furnished in the old way down to modern times\",  but the chairs in this set are almost certainly copies of an untraced earlier example. They were later acquired by Jules Soulages (1803-1856), a lawyer from Toulouse, whose collection was bought piecemeal by this museum, after it had been exhibited at Marlborough House between December 1856 and January 1857.",
