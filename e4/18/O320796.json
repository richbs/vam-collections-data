In May 1934 the Rev. H. Tyrell Green, Breckland Cottage, Santon Downham, Brandon, Suffolk,  wrote to the V&amp;A sending a photograph of the panel, noting 'This is the only remaining portion of a design which, at one time, appears to have continued round the room.'  He offered it to the V&amp;A, noting, 'It was offered to me for the Thetford Museum, but I thought that if the V&amp;A would like it, that it was the most suitable place for it.'  He asked for advice on removing the plaster panel as demolition of the house was about to take place.  He noted that 'The Manor House is said to have been built by Sir Henry North soon after 1586, so the painting may be early 17th century.'  \n\nA note from Oliver Brackett records that it was removed with difficulty and pieces had to be re-assembled.",
