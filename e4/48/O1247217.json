In April the Royal Aquarium Theatre opened at the west end of the Aquarium, equipped with a magnificent organ installed under Sullivan\u2019s supervision. The Aquarium was intended as a venue for staging art exhibitions, concerts and plays, and perhaps to rival the Crystal Palace which had moved to South London in 1854, or the Royal Albert Hall that had opened in Kensington in 1871.\n\nThis illustration from The Illustrated London News, 16 October 1875, shows the main hall which was 340 feet long by 160 feet wide. It was covered with an iron and glass roof, contained palm trees, fountains and original sculpture, and housed thirteen large tanks meant to be filled with \u2018curious sea creatures\u2019, and even a roller skating rink  that can be seen in this image. Whether skating is actually in progress or not is unclear from this image however.",
