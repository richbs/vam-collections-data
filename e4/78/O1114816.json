It was made as a promotional item for WEA records (now Warner Music Group) during the campaign for the release of the film. \n\nPurple Rain is one of Prince's most famous and enduring songs, the name of the eclectic and critically acclaimed album it came from, and the title of the cinematic film produced to accompany it. The film, in which this jacket was worn, told the autobiographical story of a musician struggling to make it in Minneapolis, USA, whilst trying to avoid following the path of his father into alcoholism. It was considered a great critical success at the time, mostly due to the power of the live performances; the soundtrack won an Academy Award for Best Original Score and it made $80 million dollars at the US box office. As a showcase for Prince's musical talents, it was a great success. Further films followed, all based around his later albums, but none reached the successes of Purple Rain, and no more were released cinematically after 1990's Graffiti Bridge.",
