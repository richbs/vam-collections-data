The clasp is made from three stylised tulips of open filigree, with a large vertical tulip in the centre, and a smaller horizontal tulip on each side.  The piece on the left, facing the clasp, is soldered to the central piece, and the piece on the right is attached by a pin fastening.  The pin is joined to the clasp by two graduated chains of figure-of-eight links, which hang across the front of the clasp, from a ring at the top of the left-hand piece, when the pin is in place.  There are 21 small pendants shaped like tulips and enamelled in green hanging from the two chains, 11 on the top chain, and 10 on the lower.  Plain sheets, cut to shape, are riveted to the back of the filigree on each part.  There is an applied dome, decorated with green enamel, in the centre of each part, each surrounded by numerous coil rings, granule rosettes and lozenges.  There are vertical bars with scalloped edges on the back to attach the clasp to a belt.",

These clasps come in a small number of basic shapes.  This one is shaped like stylised tulips, a favourite Ottoman motif.  It was worn with the pointed part facing upwards, and was fastened by a pin, which attached the right-hand piece to the rest of the clasp.  The two chains, which join the pin to the clasp, hung down decoratively over the front of the clasp when it was fastened.  \n\nIt was described as Circassian when it was acquired in 1854, but it is as likely to have come from Turkey itself, or the south Caucasus.  The fine filigree and the use of enamel, on the central bosses and the pendants on the chain, suggest that it may have been made by an Armenian silversmith.  The Armenians were famous for their silver-work in the 19th century.  They were widely dispersed outside their homeland in the south Caucasus, and produced jewellery, particularly filigree, in traditional styles for many other nationalities and faiths (they were proudly Orthodox Christian themselves).",
