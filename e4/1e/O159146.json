Along the bottom are 3 trees and many heavily stylized floral motifs, two blue animals and, to the right, what look like a human head with a red turban and green kula. Above are 2 standing male figures each with a bow and arrow in his right hand. Above are 4 seated male figures: on the left he has a sword in a scabbard, in the centre is a servant who seems to have only one arm, then there is a cross-legged figure and finally, on the right, another seemingly one-armed servant holding a bowl of sweets or fruit.  Above are 2 more blue animals, 3 trees and along the upper edge are 2 pairs of feet and legs belonging to standing figures  - this is probably a repeat of the lowest band.  The design is based on Safavid textiles.\nColours: dark brown, white, yellow, red, light green, blue, brown, light blue.",
