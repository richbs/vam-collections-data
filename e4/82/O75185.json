Watercolour miniatures fade when exposed to light, especially, as in this miniature, the reds. At the same time, miniature painters at the date of this example (1749) were still effectively experimenting with the technique of working in watercolour on the resistant surface of ivory, which was naturally oily and non-absorbent. By the 1750s they had begun to improve the ivory surface and their painting techniques by cutting the ivory more thinly and working it in such a way to remove excess grease from the surface. The flow of paint was improved, allowing greater freedom of handling and greater transparency. Artists began to exploit the pleasing effect of the luminous ivory showing through the paint. \n\nThis miniature shows Spencer working with a greater appreciation of the beauties of the ivory surface. Though pale compared to enamel, this miniature demonstrates the increasing appeal of ivory as artists adapted their painting techniques to its particular qualities.",
