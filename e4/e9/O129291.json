In a statement made in 1988 he averred that printmaking was a seminal activity for him, which significantly affected his development as an artist,  particularly the way he continued to draw, and he confessed to sometimes having a longing to make prints. \n\nThis image takes its inspiration from the hugely successful Australian movie 'Mad Max' (1979) which had a considerable afterlife in the public imagination. The film portrays  a poorly funded police force (of which the eponymous Max Rockatansky is a leading light) in the Australian outback, struggling to protect local people from the ravages of a violent gang of bikers and it is full of the paraphenalia of aggression - black leather, fast cars and bikes. Sandle was early attracted to imagery which implied  warfare, whether civilian or military - images of gas masks and armour, for example are found in early student works.",
