On the bishop's left is a young man wearing a flattish hat, a short gown and a cloak. Behind him are the head and shoulders of a third female figure. \n\nThe panel is badly damaged. The hands of the bishop and the arm of the young woman on his right are missing. The head of the bishop has been broken off and repaired. The whole of the top of the panel is missing. The eyes of the bishop have been hollowed out.\n\nThere are traces of green remaining on the lower ground, and blue on the young man's cloak and red on the cloak's lining. There is a little gilding on the hair of the female figure on the extreme left and on the hair of the bishop. There are traces of gilding on the upper background. The back of the panel bears three holes plugged with lead. The bottom is slightly chipped away.",
