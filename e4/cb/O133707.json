Served in the army, retired because of ill-health, and entered RA Schools 1818. Exhibited 171 landscapes at the RA between 1824 and 1870,131 at the BI 1822-55, and 24 at the SBA 1825-37. Subjects mainly views in Devon, but also elsewhere in England, Wales and Scotland; visited, in his yacht, France, Spain and Italy. From 1847 he collaborated regularly with the animal painter T S Cooper and sometimes with Sir Edwin Landseer. Elected ARA 1834, RA 1838. According to Cooper, he saw painting 'more of a pastime than as a business, and he always gave me the impression that he considered the profession beneath him'. Retired from the RA 1871, and died at Vleeson Bank, South Africa, 5 June 1879. \nLIT: \tAthenaeum 12 July 1879, p58 (obit); Art Journal 1879, p184 (obit); T S Cooper My Life 1890, I, pp325-30 \n\nNear Redleaf, Kent \nFA 106 \nPanel, 21.6 X 29.2 cm (8 \u00bd X 11 \u00bd ins) Sheepshanks Gift 1857 \nThe collector William Wells of Redleaf was a patron of Lee. Lee painted several views of and around Redleaf, which is near Penshurst, Kent; most date from the years around 1830, such as 'A Scene near the Source of the Medway' exhibited at the SBA in 1829 (380), and 'Redleaf, Kent' at the BI in 1827 (134, size including frame given in the catalogue as 39 by 48 inches). In 1840 he exhibited 'River Scene in the Meadows, Redleaf, Kent' at the BI (163, size given as 27 by 29 inches); the subject, if not the size, seems to correspond with that of the present work. \nIt is described in the MS Register as 'a sketch from nature on the Med.', and Richard Redgrave added 'An autumn study of oaks and alders on the banks of the Medway'. \n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
