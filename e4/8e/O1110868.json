For dancers at the turn of the century in St Petersburg Cecchetti's classes were inspirational and he was a key figure in the enriching of the dancers' epaulement - the more flowing use of the upper body. \n\nCecchetti opened a school in London in 1918 where British dancer, Laura Wilson, who danced with the Ballets Russes 1918-19 and 1921, found Cecchetti's classes fast - 'in no part of the class was one allowed to stop after a correction' but 'everything had a precise logic'. His system of teaching was codified by Cyril Beaumont with the assistance of dancers, Stanislas Idzikowsky, Margaret Craske and Derra de Meroda.",
