This object is made of gypsum alabaster which is a fine-grained, soft and smooth stone. Although at first glance it looks a little like marble, which it was intended to imitate, it was much easier to carve due to its softness, and alabaster objects were therefore significantly cheaper to produce. Marble does not originate in England, so it was imported if needed, whereas in the 15th century there were important alabaster quarries in Nottingham, York, Burton-on-Trent and London. England was a major centre for the production of objects such as this one. During period, they were exported in very large numbers to Europe where they survive, unlike many examples which remained in England and were destroyed or greatly damaged during the Reformation.\n\nThe brackets are decorated with nude children among foliage and fruit, separated and surmounted by various mouldings.\nThese brackets were originally part of the Abbey of Tongerloo (in modern Belgium) and they show the adaptation of Italian decorative elements by Northern designers. The running naked children, acanthus scrollwork and classical architectural forms are copied from Italian Renaissance sources that were very familiar in the North by 1520.",
