She has a bisque shoulder head, with moulded and painted facial features and curly blonde hair; her inset blue eyes are of glass.  The body, upper arms and upper legs are of undyed calico with a firm stuffing. The forearms and hands and the lower legs and feet are of moulded and painted bisque, the legs and feet painted to represent white stockings with blue garters and black ankle boots.  The clothing consists of:\n\nA short full cloak of red wool, with a large hood to cover the high-crowned hat.  The cloak fastens beneath the chin with tying strings of black ribbon and is edged throughout with featherstitch worked in black wool.\n\nA broad-brimmed hat of black beaver, the high tapering crown trimmed with black glass beads around the crown.  The hat fastens beneath the chin with tying strings of blue ribbon.\n\nA shallow loose-fitting cap of white net and lace, trimmed at each side of the face with a single ruffle of gathered lace.  The cap has no fastenings but is stitched together beneath the chin.\n\nA loose-fitting wrapover short form of the betgwn [gown] of white cotton printed with a design of red and dark blue buds or fruits on brown stems.  The garment has a V neck which is pinned closed into the body at the front; the wrist-length sleeves are gathered at the armhole and wrist.  \n\nAn ankle-length underskirt (pais) of unlined wool patterned in vertical white and red stripes on a brown ground.  The garment is arranged in unpressed pleats at the waist.\nAn apron of brown, coffe  and white horizontally striped cotton attached in unpressed pleats to a waistband and tying strings of brown cotton tape fastening in a bow at the front.\n\nA neckerchief of red cotton, just visible at the neck of the betgwn.\n\nA petticoat of striped black, white, yellow and red flannelette, with unpressed pleats at the waist.\n\nA petticoat of cream coloured flannel, with unpressed pleats at the waist, and embroidered with double featherstitch in red wool just above the hem.\n\nThe doll carries on her true right arm a shallow oval wicker basket, with a looped handle, containing a ball of red woollen yarn and a piece of tubular knitting on four steel needles.",
