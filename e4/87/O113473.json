The poem is by Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772-1834) and describes a lovers' midnight meeting. It appeared in an illustrated edition of Poets of the Nineteenth Century published by the Dalziel brothers in 1857. They were key figures in the printed book trade at this time and commissioned the work of artists for their editions.\n\nThis watercolour was painted some five years later by the British artist John Everett Millais (1829-1896). He was a member of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, a group of 19th-century painters, poets and writers who looked to early Renaissance painters for inspiration. Here, for example, Millais has shown the lovers in \u2018medieval\u2019 dress.",

He made many drawings which in beauty of line and form equal it, but none, it seems to me, which shows the same quality of ecstasy. This picture of two figures clinging together in a darkened landscape, with the great white moon rising between the branches of the trees, strikes us indeed as being in no way inferior to the work of Coleridge himself. (<i>Illustrators of the Sixties</i>, Faber and Gwyer, 1928, p.67).\n\nThe lines illustrated are these:\n\n   Her bosom heaved - she stepped aside,\n   As conscious of my look she stept - \n   Then suddenly, with timorous eye\n   She fled to me and wept                                                               '\nJason Rosenfeld and Alison Smith <u>Millais</u> London: Tate Publishing, 2007.
