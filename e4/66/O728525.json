It stands with its rear legs slightly raised on a narrow ledge of earth. The foreshortened pose emphasizes the muscularity of the horse's body. Its tail is knotted and its mane curls abundantly. Its bridle is held by a warrior who strides forward to the left behind the horse, with only his head and legs visible. He wears a helmet surmounted by ornamental designs of a dolphin and a caterpillar, ornate knee guards and carries a pike held vertically. An uneven wall tufted with vegetation forms the backdrop, with a column at the left edge of the picture with the feet and legs of a status just visible on top. The date 1505 is inscribed in the top centre and the artist's monogram at the bottom right corner in the darkened cavity.",

In The Large Horse and its companion print from the same year, The Small Horse, it has been suggested that the relationship between both animals and their human masters represents man\u2019s attempt to control sensuality by intellect. Whereas it seems as though the lively, unbridled beast in The Small Horse would like to escape, The Large Horse is a portrait of a docile, muscular animal standing patiently with its master. Unlike the classicism and idealism of The Small Horse, it is also a study in naturalism, as the artist has used great technical precision to render the details of sinew in the animal\u2019s legs, the texture of its coat, the musculature of the head, and finely curled hairs of its mane and tail.",

Its immense power, i.e., sensuality, has been brought under control; it has been bridled. The armoured warrior \u2013 his knee guards are inexplicably unidentical \u2013 is smiling victoriously. He is here a step ahead of the horse, whose tail is now doubly knotted. He has progressed from a simple, roughly hewn old wall to a refined column on which a naked idol is partially visible. Most remarkably, the knight is stepping up onto a higher level, whereas the horse is stepping down from a narrow ledge that is curving around a pit or abyss to the safe, even middle ground. The helmet is surmounted by a dolphin, the most \u2018intellectual\u2019 of sea creatures, and a caterpillar, the asexual counterpart of the butterfly.'\n(From <u>The Illustrated Bartsch 10 (Commentary): Sixteenth Century German Artists, Albrecht D\u00fcrer</u>, ed. Walter L. Strauss, New York, 1980, p.215\n\n'In general, D\u00fcrer\u2019s horses symbolize restraint. Roughly contemporary with the engraved Adam and Eve\u2026of 1504, they are natural analogues to Adam. In them art and knowledge control the body and restore man\u2019s status as the measure of things. In his Enchiridion Erasmus wrote that \u201csome have a rebellious body, an unbroken and refractory horse, so to speak; and the result is that even with the harshest bit, spurs, and club, the seating driver has trouble taming its wildness\u201d. Self-mastery, the sovereignty of the \"I\" over the inner and outer temptations, has its image in D\u00fcrer\u2019s Knight, Death and the Devil\u2026Here the self, armoured as the Christian knight of medieval pedigree, controls his powerful mount of classical pedigree as he passes through the difficult, pathless world to salvation.'\n(From Koerner, Joseph, 'Albrecht D\u00fcrer: A Sixteenth-Century Influenza', in <u>Albrecht D\u00fcrer and his Legacy \u2013 The Graphic Work of a Renaissance Artist</u> ed.
