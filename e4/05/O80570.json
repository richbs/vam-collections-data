            "public_access_description": "This depiction of Shakespeare's tragic heroine Ophelia was praised for its psychological insight. The madness and death of Ophelia were popular subjects for painters in the later 19th century. In Shakespeare's play Ophelia drowns herself in a river, driven mad by Hamlet's rejection of her. The painting was exhibited beside lines adapted from Hamlet:\n\nThere is a willow grows ascaunt the brook\nThat shews his hoar leaves in the glossy stream\nThere with fantastic garland did she make\nOf crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples.\n\nThe more than 30 types of flowers in this picture--and their symbolism--would have been familiar to Victorian viewers: the flowers surrounding Ophelia, and those in the garland she wears on her head, refer to constancy, love, hopelessness, and mourning; she wears a ring a grasses, relating to her longing for Hamlet. She holds a poppy-bud, symbolic of death.",

Entered RA Schools 1826. Worked as a drawing master in the 1830s. Exhibited 141 works at the RA between 1825 and 1883, 17 at the BI 1832-59, and 20 (including four watercolours) at the SBA 1829-35 and 1870-9. Early works were landscapes and costume pieces, mainly l8thcentury and in the manner of C R Leslie; from the 1840s he specialised in modem genre and social comment, before returning to landscape, particularly around his home in Abinger, Surrey, relieving the pressure of his administrative duties. Elected ARA 1840, RA 1851; Secretary of the Etching Club 1837-42. In 1847 he began his official career in art education as Master at the Government School of Design, becoming Head Master in 1848, Art Superintendent 1852, Inspector General 1857, and Director 1874. He was Inspector of the Queen's Pictures, compiling a catalogue of the Royal Collection, 1857-79. As he wrote in 1856: 'I regret to find that I am so identified with office work that it is almost forgotten that I am a painter' \n(F M Redgrave <u>Richard Redgrave: A Memoir</u>. . . p l 71 ). He published An <u>Elementary Manual of Colour</u>r ... (1853), <u>The Sheepshanks Gallery</u> (1870), and, most famously, with his brother Samuel, <u>A Century of Painters of the English School</u> ... (2 vols, 1866). He was offered a Knighthood in 1869, which he declined; created Companion of the Bath 1880. Died Kensington, London, 14 December 1888. His daughters Frances (who compiled the Memoir of her father) and Evelyn were also exhibiting artists. \n\nLIT: <u>Art  Journal</u> 1850, pp48-9 (referred to below as the 'autobiography'), with engr portrait; <u>Art Journa</u>I1859, p206; <u>Athenaeu</u>m 22 December 1888, pp854-5 (obit); F M Redgrave <u>Richard Redgrav</u>e, CB, RA: <u>A Memoir compiled from his diary</u> 1891 (referred to below as <u>Memoir</u>); F G Stephens in <u>Magazine of Art</u> XV, 1891-2, pp26-9; ed S Casteras and R Parkinson <u>Richard Redgrave</u> 1804-1888 1988, V &A and Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, USA, exhibition catalogue \n\n\n\n\n<b>Ophelia Weaving her Garlands </b>\nFA171 Neg 74357 \nPanel, 76.2 X 63.5 cm (30 X 25 ins) \nSigned and dated 'Richd Redgrave 1842' in white br \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nExhibited at the RA in 1842 and, according to the <u>Memoir</u>, bought by John Sheepshanks. The title given in the RA catalogue was simply 'Ophelia', with the following lines (slightly adapted) from Shakespeare's <u>Hamlet</u>, act 4 scene 7: \n\nThere is a willow grows ascaunt the brook, \nThat shews his hoar leaves in the glossy stream; \nThere with fantastic garland did she make \nOf crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples. \n\nThe<u> Memoir</u> records that Redgrave's work for the 1842 exhibition was \nbehindhand and further delayed by his brother Samuel's illness; he wrote to \t\nhis sister Margaret that 'I shall finish \"Cinderella\" and leave the others if I \nhave not time - \"Ophelia\" and \"Bad News from the Sea\".' \nThe <u>Memoir</u> also indicated that 'Ophelia' 'has been considered to be one of his best figure-pieces'. After an admiring description, particularly of the 'mournful sweetness' of the face, the <u>Athenaeum</u> critic 'could but think of the incomparable snatches of melody which Shakespeare has put into her mouth, while standing before this attractive figure; which is all the more welcome, as displaying a substantial advance made by the painter'. The reviewer also noted how the disordered clothing, strange 'light in the eyes and a quivering of the lip ... declare that Sorrow has done its worst work'. The <u>Art Union</u> would \nnot have recognised Mr Redgrave in this picture; not, be it understood from a want of excellence, but from its inconsonance with all our impressions of its author ... She is pale - woe-begone - and her restless, fevered eyes, bespeak a mind diseased. The painting of her dress, which is white, resembles the manner of some of the old masters, a feeling which is extended to the banks of the brook, this part of the work being enamelled on the canvas [sic] like the foreground of Giorgione's garden scenes. \n\nRedgrave recorded in his diary on 20 June 1857 that, on a visit to the South Kensington Museum, Queen Victoria 'seemed really to like my picture of \"Ophelia\"', and two years later the <u>Art Journal</u> commented that 'the figure is an admirable embodiment of the poet's character, and the landscape is painted with a finish and attention to detail which, in our day, would be called \"Pre-Raffaellism'''. \nRedgrave follows the description of the 'crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples' in Queen Gertrude's account of Ophelia's death, and Joanna Dean has kindly identified for the present author no fewer than 30 different flowers in the painting. The flowers around Ophelia refer to constancy, love, extinguished hopes and thoughts, purity of heart, ingratitide and mourning; she wears a garland on her head of reeds, rosehip, nettle and field scabious, symbolising similar qualities and emotions; in her hands are various other symbolic plants, notably the poppy bud indicating death. The garland is presumably also the head-dress of a bride, and she has evidently fashioned for herself a wedding ring by tying grasses around her finger, relating to her longing for Hamlet. \nThe subject of Ophelia for painting was not as popular as might be supposed, probably because of its difficulty. There were two in the 1831 RA exhibition (by John Wood and Lilburne Hicks), and later in 1852 the more famous works by Millais and Arthur Hughes. Redgrave himself painted another Ophelia (sold Christie's 15 June 1973 (65), size given as 20 by 16 inches), which scarcely even suggests the subject's derangement of mind. He also made an etching of a similar subject to illustrate Desdemona's 'Poor Barbara's Song' from <u>Othello</u> for the <u>Songs and Ballads by Shakespeare Illustrated by the Eching Club</u> published in 1843 (repr <u>Casteras and Parkinson</u> 1988, p25). \nThere are three small sketches and a chalk and watercolour study for the painting in the British Museum; a study for Ophelia's head, and a cartoon in reverse in black and red chalks and squared for transfer to the panel, are in the V&A collections. \n\nEXH: \tRA 1842 (71); <i>Exposition Universelle</i> Paris 1855 (925, as 'Ophelia', lent by J Sheepshanks); <i>Richard Redgrave</i> 1804-1888, V&A and Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, 1988 (23) \n\nENGR: Butterworth and Heath, for <u>Art Journal</u> 1859, p206 \n\nLIT: <u>Athenaeum</u> 7 May 1842, p41O; Art Journal 1842, pl2l, 1859, p206; W Sandby<u> The History of the Royal Academy of Arts </u>1862, II, p294; <u>Memoir</u> pp44, 171, 175; R Altick <u>Paintings from Books: Art and Literature in Britain 1760-1900</u> 1985, p115; <u>Casteras and Parkinson</u>, ppl07-8\n\n\n\nRonald Parkinson.\"\n<u>Vikutoria & Arub?to Bijutsukan-z? : eikoku romanshugi kaigaten = The Romantic tradition in British painting, 1800-1950 : masterpieces from the Victoria and Albert Museum / selected by Mark Evans</u> [Japan : Brain Trust], 2002. 185 p. : ill.
