The photograph shows the east wall, the fa\u00e7ade of the prayer hall which has five arched bays of which the central one  is the largest and is surmounted by a dome with 12 windows in it. The prayer hall measures 51.20 by 14.90m.\n\nThe fa\u00e7ade is finely decorated with marble and stone inlay of various colours, panels of  Koranic inscriptions, lotus bud stone carvings along the edges of the arches and small oriel windows above the arches. This building has been developed from earlier mosques such as Bara-Gumbad-Masjid (1494), Moth Masjid (1505) and Jamali-Kamali-Masjid (1528) and is extremely important as it shows the transition to Mughal style architecture.\n\nThe photograph shows the damage on the fa\u00e7ade which has subsequently been repaired. It also shows a tank in the foreground which would originally have housed a fountain. \n\nSignature and negative number in bottom right hand side.",
