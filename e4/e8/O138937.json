The design was created by Fran\u00e7ois Lesage (b.1929), who inherited the business in 1949, and was inspired by the embroidery on 18th century waistcoats.\n\nGowns that were to be embroidered were usually simply cut, like this one, to show off their sumptuous surface detail.",

The former Joan Carr, a talented pianist, looked like a fragile bird, had been a foundling (with no dated of birth in her passport), and the mistress of Edgar Wallace\u2026  When her husband was variously Chairman of the Financial Times and the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, Joan Drogheda was a prominent figure in society.
