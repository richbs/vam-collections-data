He was in charge of a nationwide system of art and science education, and, again with Prince Albert, developed the South Kensington area as the intellectual quarter of London. The Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, of which he was the founding director, remains as his best known memorial, and is a symbol of his mission to education through exhibiting.",
