The nozzle then fits into a matching slot at the back of the base.  \nOn the top of the base is the panel to house two batteries, the light and the mechanism which turns the wheels and brush.  The vacuum will pick up when operating.  Behind the panel is the release lever to lower the handle.  Underneath there is the brush, four black plastic wheel and spring coils to allow movement of the brush.\n[cover (closure)] Moulded pink plastic cover designed to fit over the mechanism and battery panel of the cleaner.  It is box shape with the top slightly domed.  At the front is an opaque strip of clear plastic, through which the light would shine.

At the bottom edge are two tongues and two knobs which fit into appropriate holes in the base.\n[Packing slip] Cream card printed in bluish purple to show the name and address of the retailer, the date Feb. 5 and the reference numbers.\n[Box] Heavy brown cardboard printed in red to show the titles, maker's details and an illustration of the toy cleaner.\nPasted to the inside are the operating instructions, a sheet of paper printed in black.
