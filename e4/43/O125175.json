He accompanied the Count of Schomburg in his travels in Europe and America, from which he brought back several landscapes. He settled in Paris in 1830 and was naturalised as a French citizen in 1870. His son, Charles-Euphrasie (1838-1904) was also a painter.\n\nThis painting is a fine example of the landscapes produced in Germanic Europe during the 19th century. The representation of a grandiose nature is characteristic of the Romantic aesthetic emerged in the 1830s under the leadership of Caspar David Friedrich. This view of the Tyrol is typically executed with a high degree of finish and clear tones.",

Romanticism started first in Western Europe as a literary and philosophical movement and only gradually involved the other arts, explicitly around 1800. Romantic artists were fascinated by nature they interpreted as a mirror of the mind. They investigated human nature and personality, the folk culture, the national and ethnic origins, the medieval era, the exotic, the remote, the mysterious and the occult. The interest in the exotic and the non-Western, illustrated in France by such a painter as Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix (1798-1863), as well as the medieval revival, witnessed in England by Horace Walpole (1717-1797), are perhaps the most identifiable parts of Romanticism. It is really in the Post-Napoleonic period that this movement gained ascendancy. Its greatest proponents were among others Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault (1791-1824) and Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 de Chateaubriant (1768-1848) in France, Joseph Mallord William Turner (1775-1851) in England, Heinrich Heine (1797-1856) and Caspar David Friedrich (1774-1840) in Germany. In the visual arts, it was largely played out by 1850, but in music it persists for another generation.",
