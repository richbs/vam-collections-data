The design is called 'Sandown' and was in production by 1940, but this version from 1946 shows differences (such as the wheel size) caused by wartime shortages, and prams generally were among the items in very short supply in the United Kingdom. Customers had to have a special permit to buy one, and retailers found it difficult to get enough to supply to their customers. The British government restricted supplies of materials, such as metal and wood, which the pram manufacturers needed, and many firms changed over to making essential items for the armed forces until the war was over.",
