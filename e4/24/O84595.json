            "production_note": "According to Francis Johnston's son, Kenneth A. Johnston, the artist usually produced designs in the following stages:\n1. A rough sketch in charcoal on detail paper.\n2. Then a more final design in lead pencil or single coloured pencil (usually blue) on detail paper.\n3. Then a design in black indian ink on Bristol Board in final detail. These designs were usually coloured in with coloured pencil (sometimes watercolour).\n4. The indian ink version was then produced on detail paper (traced through) in lead pencil or coloured pencil and the detail paper version was then perforated using a perforation machine (fine needle).  The perforated copy was then placed onto a textile  and a blue powder was then pounced through.  This pouncing transferred the design to the textile which was then sprayed with methylated spirits to set the powder and thus the design onto the textile.  None of the designs in this group, E.1550-1556-2001, are pricked and pounced for transfer.  Numerous perforated copies were needed . The process was very labour intensive  - the more successful the design the more labour was needed from the designer to produce more perforated versions.  Kenneth Johnston stated that 'My father often drew a design dozens of times before he produced a version which satisfied him.'  This design is therefore a more finished drawing in the process of design.\n\nAttribution note: There is a pinhole in the centre of the circular design which were probably made by a compass.",
