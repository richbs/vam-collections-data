            "public_access_description": "Silk and satin theatre playbills and programmes were produced from the 18th century onwards to commemorate special evenings at the theatre. Most theatres and some circuses in the 19th century had some made to mark grand openings or milestone performances. By the end of the First World War however the practice had generally died out, only being revived very occasionally, more often at London's opera houses than any other theatres.\n\nThis silk commemorated the appearance of George and William Pinder's circus in South Shields in the presence of Robert Ingham, the Member of Parliament for South Shields from 1832 until 1841, and from 1852 until 1868. Pinders' Circus was founded in 1854 by the brothers William Pinder (1828-1916) and George Pinder (1830-1906) so this playbill was produced between 1854 and 1868 when the Pinders began touring in France and eventually settled there. The equestrian Mr. Hicken, described on this playbill as 'England's First-Rate Horseman' was probably the son of Mr Hicken who appeared with Ryan's Company of Equestrians in Manchester in 1836, and at Vauxhall Gardens in the late 1830s and early 1840s. The equestrian entertainment The Rigs of Mr. Briggs, or, The Pleasures of Horse and Housekeeping, also on this bill, was described as a 'Grand Spectacular Farce' when it was mounted in London at Sanger's Circus in February 1878.",
