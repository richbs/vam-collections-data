WHITTOCK\nCostumes of the University of Oxford, 1822.\nLettered with title, descriptive notes and <i>Drawn by N. Whittock, High Street, Oxford.  Engraved by J. Baker, 2, Leigh Street, Red Lion Sq., London.</i>\nEtching and aquatint coloured by hand. \n25.2 X 60.3cm\nE.369-1943\nGiven by Mr Arthur Laws.\n\nThis print would have been intended to fulfill a somewhat mundane function as part advertisement (one can imagine it hanging in a tailors) and part souvenir.  The colouring of academic outfits was significant and slight variations were of great importance to the status of the wearer.  With prints such as this, in which the colouring conveys information that would be lost or obscured if the colouring was absent, we can more secure in assuming the colouring is contemporary.  Other types of prints in which the hand-colouring conveyed essential information include botanical and zoological subjects and prints concerned with the decorative arts.  the V&amp;A possesses a copy of <i>The Works of Architecture of Robert and James Adam</i>, 1779-1779, partly hand-coloured, which aimed to show the colours the designer envisaged being used for his internal decorating schemes.\"\n<u>Victoria and Albert Museum, Department of Engraving, Illustration and Design and Department of Paintings, Accessions 1943</u>, London: HMSO, 1956.\nThe full text of the record is as follows:\n\n'<b>BAKER, J.
