            "physical_description": "Woven silk satin embroidered with couched metal thread and silk in straight stitches, backed with silk satin and with a facing of woven silk and metal thread.\nThe central field is crimson red satin [crimson red warp and pale pink weft] covered with a bold design in couched silver and silver-gilt thread on various coloured silk cores with some embroidered details in coloured silks. The design centres round an 8-pointed or lobed star frame in the centre of which is a multi-petalled rosette form with secondary petals in mid-blue, 2 shades of pink and dark blue; these lead into small trefoil leaf forms edged with a raised metal thread outline and with inner details in faded coral pink and golden brown or faded coral pink and dark blue. From the main petals, long thick stalks emerged each carrying a lobed trefoil leaf, all in metal thread, alternately silver and silver-gilt, couched to form a series of small lozenges; small details are scattered in the remaining spaces. The star frame itself is also raised with an inner band of metal thread entwined with a thick brown silk cord.  Each star point leads into a nine petalled rosette in silver and silver-gilt, alternating with a larger exotic blossom in silver or silver-gilt with details in various beiges, faded coral red and dark blue.  From each larger blossom, two flowering stems emerge curving back to frame the blossom in silver-gilt and coloured silk, while a central leafy stem points into the corner. This central panel is edged all round with a 2 cm wide band of couched silver thread containing a static leaf meander pattern in faded coral pink edged with yellow and dark green; this band is edged in black silk cord and silver metal threads.  This band frames the wide [11.5 cm] border of bronze brown satin which is decorated with large multi-petalled rosettes in 2 variations, each with two curling leafy stems emanating from either the top or the bottom.  In each of the four corners [as delineated by the 2 cm wide band] is a large 'artichoke'-type blossom all in silver and silver-gilt with details in faded coral pink, dark blue, beige, yellow and pink.\nEmbroidery Threads: 2S-plied silk: faded coral pink, pale yellow, light and dark blue, pink, beige, dark green.\nMetal thread:  very tarnished so it's difficult to ascertain the amount of silver and/or silver-gilt strip close S-wound on silk core, Z-twist white, pale beige-yellow and pink.  Often couched in small lozenge forms. \nBacking: light blue satin, white warp and blue weft.\nFacing: pieced; narrow striped woven silk, bias-cut, dark blue which is probably faded dark green, and white warp stripes, the former with an interrupted floral meander in faded coral pink and pale yellow [with silver-gilt strip open  s-wound around it], and the latter carrying cartouche-like forms containing small blocks of colour [faded coral pink and light mauve in small diamond formations].",
