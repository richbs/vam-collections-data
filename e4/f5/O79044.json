The top is hinged and can be raised on a ratchet for writing or drawing. Below is a compartment, lined with gilded and coloured leather, for playing backgammon. A box covered in silk hangs under the tabletop. It can be pulled out and  was used for embroidery materials.\n\nTime\nSmall work and games tables can be seen in several publications of the 1820s. George Smith showed alternative versions in The Cabinet-Maker and Upholsterer's Guide of 1826 and Peter and Michael Angelo Nicholson illustrated another example in The Practical Cabinet Maker, Upholsterer and Complete Decorator of 1826.\n\nOwnership & Use\nWork and games tables used  by women for reading, writing, drawing and embroidery. They were elegant, feminine pieces of furniture to be placed in drawing rooms, boudoirs or sitting rooms. This table is fitted with castors which make it easy to move around.",
