Philip Oliver Goldsmith, a salesman for a small optical firm, founded his eyewear company in London in 1926. In 1935 his son Charles Goldsmith entered the firm with the aim of making glasses a fashion item. From the company\u2019s offices in Poland Street, his sons A. Oliver and Ray Goldsmith built upon the company\u2019s reputation for attention-grabbing designs and solicited celebrity endorsement for their products. Key clients included Lord Snowdon, the actress Diana Dors, Princess Grace of Monaco and Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\nA slightly softened version of this style was worn by Princess Margaret for many years. It dates from the same year and same collection as 'Polygon' (T.245F-1990), both inspired by the 50 pence piece that came with Britain's adoption of the decimal monetary system  in 1971. Oliver Goldsmith offered it in many colours, one of the most popular being clear or 'crystal' as it was called at the time.",
