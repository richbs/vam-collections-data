Using concrete poetry as a kind of springboard Houedard developed a way of making more purely abstract or pictorial images with the typewriter keys. \n\nThis  image may have been designed using the typewriter but if so, has been transferred to a more conventional print medium and thus has a different kind of visual impact from the works Houedard made directly as sheets of typed-on paper. The 'poem' runs as follows:\nareearthsseastears/ earthstearsareseas/ seasareearthstears/ seasareearthstears/ \nearthsseasaretears/ tearsareearthsseas/ areearthstearsseas.",
