A Tuscan, though secretary to the Neapolitan Embassy, he made his first ascent on 15 September 1784 from the ground of the Honourable Artillery Company at  Moorfields in the City of London. He was accompanied by a pigeon, a cat, a dog, a  bottle of wine and a leg of chicken. He touched down briefly at North Mimms, where the cat abandoned ship, and finally landed near Ware in Hertfordshire. The distance was twenty-four miles and it was covered in two hours and a quarter. Describing the event  the Gentleman's Magazine  reported: 'The balloon was seen to rise, with all the majesty  that heart could wish, to the astonishment of millions, who, scarcely open to conviction,  beheld it with a kind of awful terror, which rather closed their lips to stupid silence, then  prompted them to rend the air, as might have been expected, with joyful acclamations' (The Gentleman's Magazine and Historical Chronicle , 1784 (Part II), p.711). In his own account of the ascent, printed for the author in 1784, Lunardi wrote that after a sudden  silence the crowd 'passed from incredulity and menace to the most extravagant  expressions of approbation and joy'. On landing, some terrified labourers refused to  help him, until persuaded by a girl working with them, exclaiming that 'they would have  nothing to do with one who came in the Devil's house (or possibly Devil's horse)'. Later in the same year he exhibited his balloon at the Pantheon. This flight and subsequent  ones made in the following year - one from St. George's Fields, Southwark, close to the  delftware potteries - aroused considerable interest, as did the flight by Jean Pierre  Blanchard and Dr John Jeffries, his American patron, on 7 January 1785, when they  crossed the Channel from England to France. In order to gain height they desperately  jettisoned all extra weight, including Blanchard's trousers. Both Lunardi's and  Blanchard's flights are recorded on English delftware. \n\nThe balloon ascent depicted on this flower pot appears to show that of Blanchard and Jeffries of 7 January 1785, but the details are too sketchy to be certain.  The shape is of a general type frequently found in Continental faience. However a very few, more elaborate, examples are known which can be shown to be English and Irish. At this late date there were very few delftware factories still in existence, and the majority of these were in London.\n\nInformation taken from Archer, Michael.

A pair in a private collection, much more like the Museum's pot, are painted in polychrome of a type only found at Dublin.\n\nNote from a delftware flask commemorating Lunardi's ascent in a balloon, 3846-1901, reads:\n\nThis flask commemorates the first aerial voyage made in Great Britain. Vincenzo  Lunardi, a Tuscan, though secretary to the Neapolitan Embassy, made his first ascent  on 15 September 1784 from the ground of the Honourable Artillery Company at  Moorfields in the City of London. He was accompanied by a pigeon, a cat, a dog, a  bottle of wine and a leg of chicken. He touched down briefly at North Mimms, where the  cat abandoned ship, and finally landed near Ware in Hertfordshire. The distance was  twenty-four miles and it was covered in two hours and a quarter. Describing the event  the Gentleman's Magazine  reported: 'The balloon was seen to rise, with all the majesty  that heart could wish, to the astonishment of millions, who, scarcely open to conviction,  beheld it with a kind of awful terror, which rather closed their lips to stupid silence, then  prompted them to rend the air, as might have been expected, with joyful acclamations'(The Gentleman's Magazine and Historical Chronicle , 1784 (Part II), p.711). In his own  account of the ascent, printed for the author in 1784, Lunardi wrote that after a sudden  silence the crowd 'passed from incredulity and menace to the most extravagant  expressions of approbation and joy'. On landing, some terrified labourers refused to  help him, until persuaded by a girl working with them, exclaiming that 'they would have  nothing to do with one who came in the Devil's house (or possibly Devil's horse)'.

In order to gain height they desperately  jettisoned all extra weight, including Blanchard's trousers. Both Lunardi's and  Blanchard's flights are recorded on English delftware. Various visual records were  available to the potters including an aquatint by Jukes and an admission ticket fro  Lunardi's ascent (For material relating to ballooning, see Bonham's catalogue of the  sale of a collection of Fine Ballooning Art, 16:12:1991). Garner found a number of  fragments of dishes showing a Lunardi ascent. The shape of the cage under the  balloon shown on the Museum's flask indicates that it is the one used on the first  ascent (The author is grateful to Charles Gibbs-Smith for information supplied for this  entry).\n\nArcher, Michael.
