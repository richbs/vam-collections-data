            "public_access_description": "This illustration to the Akbarnama (Book of Akbar) depicts Khwajah Mu\u2019azzam, the maternal uncle of the Mughal emperor Akbar (r.1556\u20131605), being punished for murdering his wife. On Akbar\u2019s orders he is being thrown into the seething waters of the River Jamuna (in present-day Bangladesh) with his companions. Khwajah Mu\u2019azzam survived his punishment and was imprisoned in Gwalior in central India, where he died of melancholia and brain disorder. Another painting (I.2:37-1896), thought to be by the same unidentified artist, is on the other side of this folio.\n\nThe Akbarnama was commissioned by Akbar as the official chronicle of his reign. It was written in Persian by his court historian and biographer, Abu\u2019l Fazl, between 1590 and 1596, and the V&A\u2019s partial copy of the manuscript is thought to have been illustrated between about 1592 and 1595. This is thought to be the earliest illustrated version of the text, and drew upon the expertise of some of the best royal artists of the time. Many of these are listed by Abu\u2019l Fazl in the third volume of the text, the A\u2019in-i Akbari, and some of these names appear in the V&A illustrations, written in red ink beneath the pictures, showing that this was a royal copy made for Akbar himself. After his death, the manuscript remained in the library of his son Jahangir, from whom it was inherited by Shah Jahan.\n\nThe V&A purchased the manuscript in 1896 from Frances Clarke, the widow of Major General John Clarke, who bought it in India while serving as Commissioner of Oudh between 1858 and 1862.",
