            "public_access_description": "A pair of hand coloured wood cuts showing Henry Irving (1838-1905) and Ellen Terry (1847-1928), signed Edward Gordon Craig (1872-1966). Both are shown in profile. Irving (facing to the right) is wearing a wide awake hat, white shirt and dark suit. Ellen (facing to the left) is shown with hair loosely swept back, a white bead necklace at her throat and wearing a low cut black dress. They have been mounted together in a cream frame, their autographs are displayed beneath the images.\n\nThe artist who created the wood cuts from which these images were printed was the son of Dame Ellen Terry, an actress who spent 24 years acting with Sir Henry Irving at the Lyceum Theatre between 1878-1902. Edward Gordon Craig's first woodcut was made in 1895 and these prints reflect his early style so are likely to date from between 1895-1899. \n\nA book of Craig's early woodcuts was published in circa 1899 by Herbert S. Stone it was entitled Henry Irving. Ellen Terry. etc : a book of portraits.",
