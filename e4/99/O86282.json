            "public_access_description": "This object would have been used in a Catholic church. The function of a monstrance is to display the Sacred Host - the bread which, when consecrated by a Catholic priest during the service of Mass, miraculously transforms into the body of Christ. The Host would have been placed inside the window in the crescent-shaped holder called a 'lunula'. This example may have been placed on the altar as a focus for worship during the service of Benediction, or held up during church processions for all the congregation to see.\n\nThis monstrance is elaborately decorated with imagery associated with Christ and the Eucharist, the mystical moment of transformation during the Mass. The plaque beneath the window shows the Last Supper, in which Christ shared bread and wine with his disciples, saying \u2018This is my body and blood\u2019. The apostles are seated around the table but Christ himself is absent, to be replaced by the Host when the monstrance was in use. The imperial crown at the top represents God the Father. The cornucopias, the horns on either side containing grape vines and ears of corn, symbolise the wine and bread of the Eucharist, the blood and body of Christ.\n\nJohann Zeckel was one of the leading goldsmiths in Augsburg in the early 18th century, a renowned centre for goldsmiths work. He specialised in making church vessels and is known to have made several other monstrances.",
