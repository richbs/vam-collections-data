Such cabinets were highly prized in Europe for their exotic materials - ebony and ivory - and for the quality of their workmanship. \n\nAlthough made in India, the designs themselves conform closely to patterns found on Hispano-Moresque woodwork. European cabinets were clearly used as models for such work and in fashioning objects for western markets Indian craftsmen clearly copied both form and ornament.",
