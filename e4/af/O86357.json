It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre. He compiled them in a series of albums. Ginnett\u2019s company was on the bill with the comedian Bob Hutt, whom Cooke also drew that week.\n\nFrederick Emile Ginnett (1859-1924) was the third son of the equestrian and circus proprietor John Frederick Ginnett (1825-1892), and the grandson of the founder of Ginnett's Circus, Jean Pierre Ginnett (1797-1861). At Hanley Fred Ginnett's company put on an equestrian sketch called \u2018Rejected Remounts' concerning a portly gentleman who wanted to buy a horse for exercise. By 1906 Ginnett\u2019s company was performing \u2018Turpin\u2019s Ride to York\u2019, incorporating bioscope effects. Ginnett starred as Dick Turpin riding a real horse, billed as \u2018the best trained mare the world ever saw\u2019. In 1909 the Variety Artistes\u2019 Federation elected Ginnett \u2018King Rat\u2019 of the Grand Order of Water Rats.",

By 1906 he had created a company performing the sketch 'Turpin's Ride to York' in which he played Dick Turpin riding a real horse, billed as 'the best trained mare the world ever saw' (The Performer, 29 March 1906).   This caricature comes from the first of several albums compiled by the graphic artist George Cooke, featuring performers working in the music hall in the early 20th century.  The album is dated 1903-4-5.",
