War was declared on the 11 October without a shot being fired.\n\nJohannesburg fell to the British on 1 May 1900 and the British flag returned to Pretoria after 19 years' absence on 5 June 1900 when Lord Roberts and the British troops made their official entry into Church Square, Pretoria's chief square, marching down Market (Paul Kruger) Street. The Union Jack was hoisted, the National Anthem was sung and the troops filed past their leader. First came the Guards, then Stephenson's Brigade and the Artillery, then the Mounted Infantry. After them, Ian Hamilton's men and the two brigades of Dorien-Smith and Bruce Hamilton.\n\nWar continued outside the town's borders for another two years but the Treaty of Vereeniging was eventually signed just before midnight in Melrose House on 31 May 1902.",
