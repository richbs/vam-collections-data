There is a border with a light green meander with leaves and red or yellow trefoil flowers.  This also forms the three sides of the rectangular central panel and a band under the main border as it runs across the top of the prayer mat. The main border is on 3 sides.  It contains upward facing sprigs of 3 pale carnations outlined in red or yellow.  The penultimate sprig in the top of the top hand border has one dark and 2 light flowers, instead of three light coloured ones. The central panel is divided into a lobed niche.  The spandrels are decorated with a diamond lattice with a red or yellow flower, coloured arranged to form diagonal lines meeting along the central vertical axis.  The ground of the niche is covered with offset rows of flowers: red flowers and yellow buds alternate wit yellow flowers and red buds.  There is a roundel in the upper part of the niche which contains an illegible inscription.\nUnderdrawing is clearly seen.",
