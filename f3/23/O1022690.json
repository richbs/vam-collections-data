            "public_access_description": "Ground plan of the Dominican Church at Viterbo as intended to be built by leading architect and designer Sir William Chambers (1723-1796). The church was remodelled by Nicola Salvi (1697-1751) in 1737. Chambers arrived in Italy late in the summer of 1750 and stayed until the following year. There was therefore a period of some months during which Chambers could have met Salvi and discovered how he intended the church to look. It is also possible that Chambers may have copied designs for the church, which became available to him after Salvi's death. He was so impressed with the work that he recommended the church to his former pupil Edward Stevens in a letter written in 1774 prior to Stevens's departure for Italy.\n\nChambers was born in Sweden and died in London. He travelled widely, visiting China, and studied architecture at the Ecole des Arts, Paris, from 1749 and in Italy from 1750 to 1755.  Many of his drawings from this period are contained in his important 'Franco-Italian' album, held in the V&A.  Chambers moved to London in 1755 and published his influential Treatise on Civil Architecture in 1759.  Chambers demonstrated the breadth of his style in buildings such as Gower (later Carrington) House and Melbourne House, London, in such country houses as Duddingston, Scotland, and in the garden architecture he designed for Wilton House, Wiltshire, and at Kew Gardens. He became head of government building in 1782, and in this capacity built Somerset House, London.",
