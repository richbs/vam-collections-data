The painting bears a poem composed and inscribed by the artist, which indicates that the painting is a memory image of the artist trip to Mt Huang thirty years ago. The landscape is typical of the artist's style in this period, just before he developed the splashed-ink-and-colour technique. Here the expressive broad strokes are excuted in balance with more descriptive ones. \n\nZhang Daqian is regarded as one of the greatest artists in the 20th-century China. Today his paintings are sought after by collectors worldwide. The painting was sold to the museum in 1966 by a then London-based female Chinese artist Mrs C.L. Fang on behalf of Zhang Daqian. Mrs Fang was his close friend and studied painting with him. \n\nBibliography: Rene-Yvon Lefebvre d'Argence, 'Chang Dai-chien: a Retrospective', Center of Asian Art and Culture, The Avery Brundage Collection, (San Francisco, 1974): Chu-tsing Li, 'Trends in Modern Chinese Painting', Artibus Asiae supplementum 37 (Ascona, 1979); Shen C.
