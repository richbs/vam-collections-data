The original is first recorded in collection of J. van der Linden van Slingeland in 1752 and was sold in Dordrecht in 1785 to the Earl of Yarborough [Charles Anderson-Pelham, 1st Earl of Yarborough (8 August 1781 \u2013 5 September 1846)].  Cuyp\u2019s Seventeenth-Century Dutch patrons appear to have primarily belonged to the wealthy merchant class in Dordrecht and his works became particularly popular in the late 18th and early 19th century in Britain.  Cuyps landscapes were were among those reproduced in John Boydell's 1769 volume of prints etched after old master paintings [Boydell, John, ed.<i> A Collection of Prints, Engraved after the Most Capital Paintings in England</i>, London, 1769].  The Frenchborn dealer Noel Joseph Desenfans (1745-1807) for example, whose collection now forms the basis of the Dulwhich Picture Gallery, owned at least 10 works by Cuyp.  Following the British Institution's first exhibition of Old Master paintings in london in 1815, which included a notable group of Dutch and Flemish pictures, both British collectors and painters such as J.M.W. Turner and Thomas Gainsborough developed a special affection for Cuyp\u2019s work.  The collecting of Cuyp\u2019s paintings is essentially an English phenomenon and more works by Cuyp are found in Britain than in any other country. Compared to other Dutch painters, Cuyp was discovered rather late, but once his collectability was established the flight of his paintings from Holland was immediate and total.  By 1800 no significant work by Aelbert remained in his homeland. For a longer discussion of the collecting of Cuyp in England, see Alan Chong essay in <i>Aelbert Cuyp</i>, Arthur K. Wheelock, Jr. (ed.), Exh cat. National Gallery of Art, Washington, National Gallery, London, Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, 2001-2002.  The V&A picture bears witness to the popularity of Cuyps work in England in this period. It was probably painted in the UK some time after the arrival of the original around 1785.",

The Huis Te Merwerde, just outside of Dordrecht, was built at the beginning of the fourteenth century as a residence for Daniel IV van der Merwede on land leased from the Count of Holland. It was partially destroyed during the seige of Dordrecht in 1418 when Jan van Beieren, duke of Brabant, had turned the fortress into his residence, the city\u2019s inhabitants, in a fit of revenge, attempted to destroy the building. The structure thus gained its historic significance through two most disastrous events of Dordrechts past and served as a reminder of the trials Dordrecht had overcome in order to become the prosperous economic center it was in Cuyps own day.",
