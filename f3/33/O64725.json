Ashton created the role for Margot Fonteyn and it is probably the most important role Ashton made on Fonteyn at this period.  The costume was worn by Fonteyn in the second scene, when Chloe has been abducted by pirates, and first part of the third scene, when she is first reunited with Daphnis; it probably dates from the revival in the 1960s, as the skirt is longer than that worn by Fonteyn in 1951 and would have been more flattering to the older dancer.\n\nHistorical significance: The costume represents one of the most important creative partnerships in the history of ballet - that between Frederick Ashton and his muse, Margot Fonteyn.   Their early collaboration is represented in the collection by the Fedorovitch-designed costume for Fonteyn as the Poor Girl in Nocturne (1944 revival) but the Museum has nothing representing the post-war creations.  Apart from Ondine, Chloe in Daphnis and Chloe in 1951 is probably the most important role Ashton made on Fonteyn at this period.  The designer was John Craxton, a most successful example of a leading painter designing for ballet for the first time.",
