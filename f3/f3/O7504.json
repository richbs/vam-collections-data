The bottom is plain black metal with blue plastic feet protruding through it.  At the back on a dark blue slide is the patten of dark blue metal with the paper holder of copper held on a spring at each side.  The patten knobs at the ends are red plastic.  In front of the patten is a ruler marked with lines from 0 to 70.  Stretched in front and slightly above is the typewriter ribbon, black. it has metal eyelets at the ends to hook on to hooks.  At the front of the body, a typewriter key board is laid out in individual very dark blue plastic knobs with moulded raised lettering painted white.  The front space bar has no lettering and the knobs/keys do not work.  From the middle of the body the back sharply rises and is divided with a space in the middle.  On the left side is a large knob marked COLOR CONTROL and on the right one marked CLEAR SET.  \nThe typewriter actually works by a disc and lever mechanism set in the space in the middle of the back.  The letters, of red plastic, are arranged around the outer edge of a disc which has on its top a metal plate marked in black and white with the letters.  In the centre of the disc is a large red plastic knob for turning the disc around.  To the right side is an arrow and at the front two levers.  The bottom lever acts as the space bar and the top one throws the disc forward.  A letter is chosen by placing it against the arrow, the lever is pressed and the letter hits the ribbon and prints on to the paper.\n[Bag] cellophane bag printed in blue to show the name and maker's trade mark\n[Bag] cellophane bag printed in red to show the title and trademark; designed to hold the red ribbon\n[Ribbon] length of red ink cotton ribbon with a metal eyelet at each end\n[Box] corrigated cardboard printed in red, white and blue to show the name and maker's marks.  the top opens and at the front when closed two handles are formed so it can be carried.",
