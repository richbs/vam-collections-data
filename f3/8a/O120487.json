He set up a studio in Simla with Charles Shepherd and sold his prints sold to an eager public both in India and Britain.",

The markings on the mount are an indication of the history of the object, its movement through the museum and the way it is categorised. \nThe mount is green, it has a label with the title on it on the right hand side.\n\nHistorical significance: This photograph shows the Northern Palace of the Haram Sara but is populalry known as or Birbal's House. It is unlikely that Birbal (officer in Akbar's court?) actually lived here as the building was an integral part of the imperial Harem (area where women of the household resided) and is most likely to have been inhabited by Akbar\u2019s two senior queens. \n\nIt is one of the largest and finest of the domestic buildings in Fatehpur Sikri, it has two storeys, the ground floor has four rooms and the first floor has two. The building is distinct because of the profusely decorated  and carved interior and exterior. The walls, pillars, pediments and capitals have a mixture of both Hindu and Islamic motifs. \n\nAn inscription on the western entrance of a room on the ground floor confirms that the building was built in 1572 or 1582 ( the discrepancy is due to one of the digits being difficult to read).",
