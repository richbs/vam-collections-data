The embossed almond forms are reminiscent of early medieval metalwork, and the scallops of Islamic ornament. The calligraphic lettering of the monogram IHS (the traditional abbreviation of the name of Jesus) at the centre of the cross is Celtic.\n\nOwnership & Use\nThe cross was designed by the architect Philip Webb (1831-1915) for the chapel of a religious community and theological college for women, the Rochester and Southwark Diocesan Deaconess's House, Clapham Common, London. The candlesticks that accompanied the cross on the altar were probably made by Barkentin & Krall. The ensemble, together with a superfrontal (altar cloth) designed by Webb and embroidered by May Morris, was given to the V&A in 1970. In that year Deaconess's House ceased to function as a theological college for women.",
