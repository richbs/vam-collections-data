The Virgin Mary, bareheaded and wearing a gown and a robe draped from the left, sits at a bench-desk which extends across most of the bottom of the panel. She holds an open book originally doubtless bearing Isaiah's prophecy as a painted inscription, the front cover resting on the desk, the other on her lap. She looks up to her right at the archangel Gabriel, her right hand raised in acknowledgement of his salutation. The winged figure of the angel, wearing a gown and robe, stands on a ledge. He leans forward, turning, his left leg facing the front of the panel, pointing at Mary with his right hand. A scroll, held in his left, curves down, enclosing the figure of Mary, to touch her desk. It no doubt carried an inscription of the angel's salutation. A vase with three lily flowers stands in the bottom left-hand corner. \n\nThe handle of the vase is missing. The top right-hand corner of the battlementing is missing. No paint survives. The back of the panel bears four lead-plugged holes. The bottom of the panel is scooped away and near the top of the panel the alabaster has likewise been scooped out.",

This representation conforms to the usual iconography of representations of the Annunication. \n\nThere are two sorts of alabaster. Calcite alabaster is very hard and was used in ancient times. This object is made of gypsum alabaster which is a fine-grained, soft and smooth stone. Although at first glance it looks a little like marble, which it was intended to imitate, it was much easier to carve due to its softness, and alabaster objects were therefore significantly cheaper to produce. Marble does not originate in England, so it was imported if needed, whereas in the 15th century there were important alabaster quarries in Nottingham, York, Burton-on-Trent and London. England was a major centre for the production of objects such as this one. During period, they were exported in very large numbers to Europe where they survive, unlike many examples which remained in England and were destroyed or greatly damaged during the Reformation.",
