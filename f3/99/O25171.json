The lotus flowers at each shoulder hold a bell (left) and dorje or thunderbolt sceptre (right, now missing), indicating that the abbot had reached the exalted status of an enlightened being, as the paired symbols signify Buddhahood.\n\nThis image is one of a substantial group of inscribed bronzes of religious teachers belonging to this date.

This image has a dedicatory inscription around the base naming the lama.  He may be identified with a distinguished Sakya abbot of that name who lived from 1147 to 1216.  An eminent teacher, he makes the gesture of expounding the dharma (Buddhist law) and wears the distinctive \"cloud collar\", a garment probably of central Asian origin.",
