It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years.  Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nThe diminutive Betty Jumel is perhaps best remembered as Humpty Dumpty in the pantomime of that name at the Leeds Theatre Royal which holds the record as the longest-running pantomime ever.  Starring Norman Evans, the pantomime ran for twenty-two weeks from December 1943.  Betty Jumel was a northern actress who also appeared in Cup-Tie Honeymoon (1948), one of the first films made to appeal to northern audiences by John E. Blakeley in his Manchester film studios. Other films in which she appeared included Betty Demobbed (1944) and Under New Management (1946). In 1956 she appeared in the BBC television programme The Norman Evans Show.",
