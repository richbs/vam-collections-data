More women in Norway still own and wear traditional jewellery than in any other country in Europe.  You can see this jewellery being worn at weddings or on other social occasions to this day.\n\nMost Norwegian women\u2019s traditional dress includes a bodice, which was laced up at the front.  For festive and wedding dress, the eyelets through which the lacing cord was threaded, the cord itself, and the tags at the end of the cord, were all made of silver.  \n\nNorwegian bodice tags, like this, are plainer than those used in Sweden and Germany.  They look rather like English sewing tools for threading lace.  They were originally attached to a long silver chain, but very few of those have survived.",
