He frequently uses the style of 16th and 17th century draughtsmen to create his illusions. His work also seems to have developed out of the ideas of the 20th century Dutch artist Maurits Cornelius Escher. \n\nBy a very precise construction of architectural features, often with the 'naturalising' effect of landscape also brought into play, Orosz tricks the eye into reading two different images almost simultaneously. At least one writer, Margaret Moore, relates this treatment of the image to the way in which Eastern European artists under Communism 'learned the subtle art of misdirection and hidden messages. There would be a second image hidden in the first and the public always understood to read between the lines see behind the picture'.",
