Modern impressions from the original copperplates, and a copy of Thomas Turner's Blue Willow pattern engraving. \n<i>Most lettered with factory marks, numbers etc.  E.45 lettered</i> This engraving is a Copy made by Joseph Hassall, of Thomas Turner's original Engraving which S. T Harrison gave to A. G. Copeland. Feb. 29th, 1940. \n<i>Engravings.  Various sizes.</i>             E.33-52-1966 \n\nGiven by Mr. Franklin A. Barrett \n\n<i>Note:</i>  A pottery works was established at Caughley by Edward Browne of Caughley Hall shortly before 1750.  At his death in 1753 he was succeeded by his nephew Ambrose Gallimore whose partner Thomas Turner, having been apprenticed as an engraver, probably to Robert Hancock, at the Worcester Porcelain Company, came to Caughley about the year 1772.  Robert Hancock left the Worcester Porcelain Company in 1775 and is said to have worked with Turner after that date, but there appears to have been a connection between the Worcester and Caughley factories in the early years of manufactory, and patterns by him and identical marks are to be found on the ware of both factories.  The famous Blue Willow pattern first appears on Caughley china about the year 1780, and the introduction of it is credited to Thomas Turner.  Turner retired in 1798 and the works were sold to John Rose, who having left Caughley about 1780, had set up a factory, first at Jackfield, then at Coalport where the Caughley works were transferred by 1814-15.  About the year 1885 Peter Schuyler Bruff bought the Coalport concern, and in due course business passed from the Bruff family to Cauldon Potteries Ltd., the factory being removed to Shelton, Staffordshire in 1926.  Eventually they came under the ownership of E. Brain & Co. Ltd., and are now known as Coalport China Ltd., of Stoke-on-Trent. \n...",
