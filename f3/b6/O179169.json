The figure subjects are usually taken from mythology and are similar to those on textiles, but occasionally biblical scenes occur. The carvings were probably used in the decoration of wooden caskets.\n\nCoptic refers to the Copts, which are Christian Egyptians with ancient origins dating back to the first century.",
