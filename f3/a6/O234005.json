One one side are a man holding a fan and a boy, seated in a garden with a European-style pagoda in the background; the boy seems to be playing a drum. The scene on the other side is practically identical, although here the boy does not have a drum.  When the case is opened, six paper-thin ivory tablets, each with pierced floral borders, and held by a metal pivot, fan out. The cylindrical cavity at one side of the writing case may have been used to hold a stick of graphite, or other material suitable for writing on ivory. X-radiographs show what could be a stick of graphite inside.",
