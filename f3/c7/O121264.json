            "public_access_description": "This tile showing Mrs Yates (1728-1787)inn the title role of Jane Shore by Nicholas Rowe, is one of a series of late 18th-century tiles of actors and actresses produced in Liverpool by John Sadler (1720-1789).  Sadler experimented with transfer-printing on white glazed delftware tiles, transferring images from engraved copper plates to tiles, using enamel colours that were fixed during low-temperature firing.\n\nActors and actresses could become extremely well known in the18th century, when theatres, concert halls and pleasure gardens were the major forms of public entertainment.  Engravers regularly produced images of paintings of the most popular performers, so the ability to reproduce engravings on ceramics was a lucrative development.  Since the engravings were transfer-printed, the original images appear on the tiles in reverse.\n\nBorn in Birmingham, Mary Ann Yates became one of David Garrick's leading ladies at Drury Lane Theatre where she first appeared in 1754.  After marrying the Drury Lane comedian Richard Yates, Garrick cast her in a leading role in the 1756 season.  She became a firm favourite there after her success in the coveted role of Jane Shore. Despite becoming a troublesome leading lady she was a regular member of Garrick's company until the end of the 1766\u20137 season.  Following disputes with Garrick, she appeared at Covent Garden where she played Lady Townley to William Smith's Lord Townley in the 1768-1769 season.  After a time in management of the King's Theatre in 1773, she returned to Drury Lane for the 1774\u20135 season and remained there after Garrick's retirement and delivered the elegy at his funeral.",
