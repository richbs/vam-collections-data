In 1816 he went as the artist on Lord Amherst's embassy to China but ended up resigning and working as a portrait painter in India and Burma between 1817 and 1825.  From 1828 to 1829 he travelled in Italy. While it is likely that the landscape depicted in this particular oil painting is invented it was probably inspired by what he saw on his travels.",

Three of his brothers, George, Edmund and Frederick James, were also artists. Chiefly known as a watercolourist, he travelled in Wales and the Lake District in 1802 and 1803, working with Comelius Varley and Joshua Cristall: founder member of the OWS 1804. Artist on Lord Amherst's embassy to China 1816, resigned, and worked as portrait painter in India and Burma 1817-25. Visited Italy 1828-9. Exhibited 103 works at the RA between 1804 and 1857, 42 at the BI 1806-56, 32 (including five watercolours) at the SBA 1828-53, and 154 at the OWS. Subjects principally landscapes in Wales, Lake District, south and west England, Italy and China. Died Kensington, London, 16 December 1857. Redgrave believed 'his oil pictures show much excellence, and though rather yellow in tone and monotonous, the effect of sun and sunshine is admirably expressed'. There are fourteen watercolours by him in the V&A collections. \n\nLIT: Redgrave <i>Diet</i> and <i>Cent</i>; DNB. \n\n<b>Landscape</b> \n3-1866 Neg HF973 \nCanvas, 34.2 x 51.3 cm (13\u00bd x 20\u00bc ins) \nPurchased 1866 \n\nThe location has not been identified, and may well be invented. On the other hand, Havell did exhibit such works as 'Castle and Town of Olevano, Near Subiaco, Roman States' (RA 1851), to which he may have added Picturesque figure groups. The mountain setting, the somewhat blasted tree, and the figure group in the foreground are reminiscent of the 'landscape with soldiers' compositions of l Zth-centurv artists, particularly Salvator Rosa (compare, for example, his late painting in the Staatliche Kunsthalle, Karlsruhe).\"",
