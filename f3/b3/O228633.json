The sketchbook was used to draw illustrations for the children's story, \u2018Alexander, the Circus Pony\u2019, which was the artist's first commission from Puffin books where the whole book, story and illustrations were produced by her. Published in 1943, the book was reprinted many times. It shows the artist's lively but meticulous watercolour style and combines her skill at topography and figure drawing. Though best known as a topographical watercolour artist, whose skill led to her contribution to Pilgrim Trust\u2019s \u2018Recording Britain\u2019 project, Ginger's first ambition was to become an illustrator. Her style often includes distinctive and lively sketches of people and street scenes, and can be seen in book covers for publishers such as Puffin, JM Dent and the magazine Harper's Bazaar, as well as pictorial advertisements. Ginger illustrated another children's story featuring a horse a few years later, 'The Mushroom Pony', written by Joan Lamburn.",
