The doors are finely carved, with a recurring pattern of eight-pointed stars inset with a raised flowering lotus. The doorjambs are flanked by attendant \u2018dvarapala\u2019 (door guardians) on the lower section, and there are \u2018gandharva\u2019 (celestial musicians) at intervals above. \n\nThe bearded ascetic depicted at the lower left is Narada, a \u2018risi\u2019 associated with Brahma and chief of the heavenly musicians. The pedimental figure depicts Sri-Laksmi, surrounded by celestial attendants and adoring creatures.\n\nHousehold shrines were frequently of wood and were modelled directly after stone temple shrines such as those to be seen at Vimala Vasahi on Mount Abu, built in 1032. Wood was a favoured material for the decoration of interiors of Jain household shrines and small temples. The earliest Jain temples at Mount Satrunjaya were of wood but were replaced by stone structures as awareness of the dangers of fire became more acute.",

Elaborate doorways of this kind were a traditional device for providing privacy and maintainng security for the images.  Household shrines were frequently in wood and were modeled directly in stone temple shrines such as those to be seen at Vimala Vasahi on mOunt Abu, built in 1032.  The elaboration and scale of this example suggest that it would have been installed in a very wealthy Jain home, where it would have protected the family's household images.",
