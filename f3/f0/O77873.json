The most important of these publications was Household Furniture and Interior Decoration... (1807), illustrating objects he had designed for his London house at Duchess Street. In 1801 Hope purchased the second collection of ancient vases formed by Sir William Hamilton, formerly the British Ambassador to the Naples court. These formed the nucleus for Hope's own collection of vases, which he displayed at Duchess Street.\n\nMaterials & Technique\nThe vase is decorated in the 'red figure' technique in which the areas surrounding the figures are painted in a slip (mixture of clay and water), leaving the red pottery showing through. Careful control of the firing process allowed Greek potters to oxidise the body of the pot, turning it red, by keeping the kiln well ventilated. The kiln was then starved of oxygen and filled with carbon monoxide (by using wet fuel), causing the slip to turn black. The kiln was then again well ventilated. The fresh oxygen supply turned the pottery back to red. The firing was stopped before the slip turned red once again.",
