B. Beckett has identified the scene as a view from one of the windows in the south wing (now demolished) of Leydenhall, Archdeacon Fisher's house in the close at Salisbury. \n\nThe style of the sketch corresponds with that of Nos. 311 [153-1888] and 312 [334-1888], of which the former was also made from a window of Fisher's house. No. 320 [320-1888] may therefore reasonably be linked with them and assigned to Constable's visit of 1829 to Salisbury. Holmes, p. 243, identifies the scene as 'Garden and Paddock, Salisbury(?)' but dates c.1815.\"",
