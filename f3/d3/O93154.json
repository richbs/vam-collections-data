A fluted columnar shape shaft with spirally fluted knop, supported by three tripod feet, and carved on the knees with acanthus foliage in relief and terminating in elongated claw feet. These are sustained by means of four branching arms decorated on the convex outer side with relief carving. A flat circular mahogany rim bound on the upper side has brass plating engraved within linked oral compartments with the creatures and symbols, and with the signs, of the Zodiac. Closely fitting within the zodiacal rim, and inset in a brass bound socket in the top of the shaft, pivots a vertically set circular brass band engraved Meridian, within which rotates an appropriately tilted spherical framework consisting of a knopped axis and of four symmetrical bars, vertical to the sphere, crossed by five flat brass bands horizontal to the sphere and engraved respectively: Arctic Circle; Tropic of Cancer; Equator; Tropic of Capricorn, and Antarctic Circle, the second, third and fourth being intersected at an acute angle by a broad brass band engraved Ecliptic.",

They consist of adjustable metal rings that stand for the Equator, tropics, Arctic and Antarctic circles and other features, within a horizontal ring representing the horizon. Armillary spheres were used to understand and track the movements of the planets and stars. They were a variant of solid wood celestial globes (globes of the sky), which have adjustable metal rings, and of astrolabes, which were used to represent the orbits of heavenly bodies. In England celestial globes were already known in the Middle Ages and were used in monastery schools. Armillary spheres were used in the libraries of large houses alongside wooden globes, and that is where this one is likely to have stood. They often had strong tripod feet, as in this example, to balance the heavy weight.",
