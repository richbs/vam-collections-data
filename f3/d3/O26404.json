The playing pieces, 36 are divided into two sets - blues and pinks; within each set the 18 pieces are divided into 6 of light, medium and dark colours.  The pieces are squares, some single and others joined together to form an irregular shape with a maximum of six.\n\nVagabondo Contains:-\n1  Vagabondo  Game Board with 8 double squares and 4 score lines\n1 set of rules for 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 player games.\n18 pieces in 3 shades of red\n18  pieces in 3 shades of blue\n1 bag of scoring pegs\n\nRULES FOR TWO PLAYERS\n1.

The first player places any one of his pieces, anywhere on the the squared board except on one of the 8 double squares and scores the value of the piece player using scoring pegs in his Score Line.\n5.  The second player does the same anywhere on the board and his score is the value of the piece plus the value of any pieces which his piece touches.\n6.  Any piece played on a double square must touch another piece and this doubles the value of the pieces and all the pieces it touches.\n7.  Pieces of the same colour shade must not touch (for example , two dark red pieces must not touch).\n8.  The players continue to play and score in turn until all the pieces are played and the winner is the player with the highest total score.\n\nA series of games can be played and players alternate the first move.  Simpler, or faster games can be played by using less pieces (same for each player),.\nA pieces must not be moved once a player has placed it.\nA time to place each piece can be agreed before starting.\nDoubling Dice can be used as in backgammon.\nNOTE:-  Two different pieces of the same colour shade always totals 7.\n\nGAMES FOR MORE THAN TWO PLAYERS - PLAYED TO THE RULES ABOVE\nGAMES FOR FOUR PLAYERS (2 PAIRS) - Each pair has 18 pieces in 3 shades of one colour, sitting opposite each other, with no conferring.  Each player plays in turn.  Score for each pair or score individually as preferred, using the 4 scoring positions.\nGAMES FOR 3,5 OR 6 PLAYERS - All the pieces are in a common pool and each player in turn plays any piece he wishes, of any colour and shade, within Rules above except Rule 2.
