In 1942 she wrote what became her signature song I'm Going to See You Today. During the war she  toured India, North Africa and the Middle East with a company performing for the British troops.  She became a writer at the BBC and later a television panelist. She is perhaps best  remembered for her one-woman shows and monologues, including that in which she played the harassed nursery teacher saying the now famous line: 'George - don't do that'.\n\nThe caricaturist Al Hirschfeld was born in Missouri, St. Louis, in 1903. In 1924 he went to Paris where he studied painting, drawing and sculpture. On his return to the United States he got his first commissions for cartoons for The New York Herald, to which he was to contribute for over seven decades, and later The New York Times.  During his long career Hirschfeld drew most of the major figures in the worlds of politics and entertainment and influenced countless artists and illustrators with his brilliant and elegant style, most frequently executed in pen and ink.\n\nThe inscription on this cartoon is from Joyce Grenfell to Frederick Brahms (1927-1996), who bequeathed the work to the museum.",
