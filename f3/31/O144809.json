These delicate headdresses were worn in villages throughout the foothills of the Italian Alps until the early 20th century.  Like all Italian headdresses, they were first worn at marriage, and after that on feast days and special occasions.  \n\nThe coroncina was worn across the brow like a diadem.  Brightly coloured ribbons, tied through the loops at each end, held it in place, and long filigree pendants hung down on either side of the face.  It was accompanied by matching hair pins with filigree heads, and a plaque of filigree over the coiled braids on the back of the head.\n\nThis coroncina was given to the V&A by Estella Canziani and her father Enrico.  She was a professional painter who was also passionately interested in the traditions of northwest Italy.  She wrote several books on the songs and culture of the region.",
