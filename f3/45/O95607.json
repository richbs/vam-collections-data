This was done with a chemical dip of a sulphide (such as ammonium sulphide) to bring out the sculptural contrasts of the design. The technique won great acclaim in France and England and was prefered to the overbright, commercial finishes on silver and electroplate. The casket was bought from the Great Exhibition for \u00a336.\n\nSpeaking of the Continental silver at the Great Exhibition of 1851, one critic commented: \"frosting and burnishing seem to be unanimously banished from all high class design, whether French or German, and oxidising substituted in their places, and the consequence is, that in many foreign examples, we have specimens of the most elaborate modelling, most effectively displayed as works of Art\u2026\".",
