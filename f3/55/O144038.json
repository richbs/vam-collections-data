It was part of a dining suite that later entered the catalogue of Heal's furniture shop in Tottenham Court Road, London -- this being one of Heal's versions. The open-lattice back is inspired by late eighteenth-century English chairs with a lattice of diamonds or hexagons, typically formed with thinner, moulded members rather than the undetailed squares used here. The style of this chair typifies Ambrose Heal's stripped-back Georgian manner and also owes much to the honesty and clarity of Arts and Crafts furniture.",
