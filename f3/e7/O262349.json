Multi-coloured silk including blue, white, red, beige and brown.\n\nThe design consists of one and a half large medallions. Within each large medallion are two confronted horsemen. Each one holds a spear, and with a downward thrust kills a lion beneath the horse. The horseman are in mirror image to each other. The scene is enclosed by a medallion whose inner and outer edges are multicoloured and whose main design consists of stylised heart-shaped flowers. There is also the left portion of a second large medallion. The two large medallions are connected by a smaller roundel whose design, multicoloured edges and heart-shaped stylised flowers repeats that of the larger medallion. These smaller roundels occur at the four cardinal points on the larger: centre, top, bottom, right and left. The diamond shaped ground created by the inter-connected medallions appear to have a design of stylised flowers and foliage, but its exact pattern is not legible.",
