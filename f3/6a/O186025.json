Soane, a young student inspired by the artistic and academic atmosphere of the RA, closely knew its daily needs and special events. Within one compact plan for the academy he provided for all the functions, and in some cases ingeniously juggled with the School's calendar. For instance, during the annual exhibition the three interconnecting studios on the left hand side could be cleared. The central reading room doubled as a lecture room when needed. Soane contrived the various room shapes as miniature studies in intricate spacial arrangements.",
