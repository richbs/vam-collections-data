They were intended for the cheaper end of the market. At the time many critics and design reformers condemned pictorial patterns like this as evidence of bad taste and poor design. Wallpapers with commemorative designs would probably have been used in an inn, hotel or club rather than in an ordinary home.\n\nThis paper commemorates the Duke of Wellington's most famous military victories, including Vimiero, 1808, Talavera in 1809, Bussaco in 1810 and Waterloo in 1815. Wellington had died in 1852, so this was clearly produced in reponse to a mood of national mourning for one of Britain's greatest military leaders.",
