Directional design with the top of the pattern at the bottom of the panel, so that the wearer saw the correct pattern. The Museum Number is in the top left. There is a border along the bottom: a meander with a striped stem with pink and blue flowers.  Edged along the top, bottom and sides with pointed blocks on a dark green ground.  This extends part way up the sides of the panel.\n\nThe main pattern is a series of dark brown diagonal lines from lower right to upper left.  \n\nThere are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: white ground with a meandering red and green striped stem linking a carnation with a many-petalled flower.\n[2] wider stripes in two designs: [a] spray of small blue flowers on an angled chevron stem pointing either to the right or downwards alternating with either a pointed pink blossom on a straight stem with a bunch of white and light blue flowers pointing to the right or a large pink blossoms on an angled chevron stem pointing downwards.\n[b] diagonal striped stem with 3 round pink flowers alternating with an arrangement with a group of white and light blue flowers, a pink, light and dark blue iris and other flowers.\n\nThreads: silk; 2S; white, dark blue, light blue, dark green, green, dark brown, golden brown, yellow, light beige [pale pink?], red.",
