Apprenticed to a heraldic painter in Edinburgh 1806, entered Merchant Navy 1808, Royal Navy 1812, discharged through illness 1814. Worked as scenery painter in London and Edinburgh theatres, painted panoramas and dioramas, as well as easel pictures. Exhibited 135 works at the RA between 1820 and 1867, 22 at the BI 1820-53, and 21 at the SBA 1824-29 (elected Member 1824, President 1829). Subjects almost all marine, river and coastal scenes. Elected to Sketching Society 1829, ARA 1832, RA 1835. Curator of Greenwich Hospital from 1844. Toured the Continent 1830 and 1838-9, and France 1832. Illustrated Heath's 'Picturesque Annuals' (1832, 1833, 1834), published 'Coast Scenery' 1836, and 'Sketches on the Moselle ... ' (1838). Friend of David Roberts RA and Charles Dickens. Died Hampstead, London, 18 May 1867. His son George Clarkson Stanfield was also an artist; his studio sales were at Christie's 8 May 1868 and 23 March 1876. Much admired by Ruskin, his skill at rendering both sea and sky - despite sometimes showing his theatrical interests too clearly - make him, after Turner, the most distinguished marine painter in Britain of the century. \nLIT: \tArt Journal 1857 , pp137-9; Gentleman's Magazine July 1867 (obit); J Dafforne Pictures by Clarkson Stanfield RA nd [1873]; P van der Merwe The Life and Theatrical Career of Clarkson Stanfield Bristol University PhD thesis 1979, and The Spectacular Career of Clarkson Stanfield Tyne and Wear County Council Museums exhibition catalogue 1979 (with bibliography) \n\nSands Near Boulogne \nFA190 \nCanvas, 71.1 X 110.5 cm (28 X 43 \u00bd ins) \nSigned and dated 'CS [in monogram]tanfield R.A./1838.'  br \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \nExhibited at the RA in 1838 as 'Portel, Coast of Boulogne'. Le Portel is two miles south-west of Boulogne. Chancellor commented that the work 'will repay close examination, because it is so obviously sincere and accurate in delineation, and is instinct with that breeziness which we find in so marked a degree in this painter's work'. \nEXH: \tRA 1838 (226) \nLIT: \tE Chancellor Walks Among London's pictures 1910, p253 \nREPR: Autotype in R Redgrave The Sheepshanks Gallery 1870 \n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
