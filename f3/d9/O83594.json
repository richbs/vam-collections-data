            "public_access_description": "This evening dress is an haute-couture interpretation of the wrapped garments traditionally worn by West African women.  The drapery and folds of the dress are mounted on a rigid boned waistband.  The crisp cotton fabric, printed in Manchester, was intended for export to Africa. The fabric design imitates Indonesian batik, and the borders feature the letter  'V' and '...-', its morse code signal. V-for-Victory was a popular subject for export cotton prints after the end of the Second World War. By using this fabric for a fashionable Western evening dress, the designer has created a sophisticated garment incorporating several cultures and traditions.\n\nMatilda Etches is now almost entirely forgotten except as a theatre, ballet and opera costume-maker. However, she was an extremely talented couturier, whose fashionable clothes were innovative and very carefully made. When she donated a selection of her work to the Museum in 1969, this dress and a 'Butterfly' cape (see T.185-1969) were shown to senior Museum officials as key acquisitions. They were the first modern fashion items to be accorded this honour.",
