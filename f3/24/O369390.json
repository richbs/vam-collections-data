Pieces such as this, which replicated Italian work of the most admired Renaissance period, were doubly useful. This capital illustrates not only the design of a noted Italian building (the ducal palace at Urbino) but also the quality of carving needed to create such a design successfully.",

This capital is said to have been based on an original in the Ducal Palace at Urbino.\n\nThe carvings were ordered from Biraghi in 1884 on behalf of the Department of Science and Art, then responsible for the South Kensington Museum, by Sir Henry Layard, an archaeologist and diplomat, who had retired to Venice in 1874. Although Layard originally had authority to pay \u00a350 for examples of carving from local workshops with which he was familiar the final payment was adjusted to \u00a360 to cover the costs of Biraghi's work.\n\nAfter inspection by Thomas Armstrong, Director for Art at the South Kensington Museum, and his deputy, Richard Thompson, all four examples of Biraghi's carving were sent to the Bethnal Green Museum in East London. From 1880 this had been used for displays of modern objects, including furniture and woodwork. Many small furniture workshops were situated in the same area and Biraghi's carvings may have originally been ordered to show local craftsmen examples of highly fashionable Renaissance revival woodwork for them to use as inspiration.",
