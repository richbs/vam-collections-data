This interest in Black culture found commercial success in the Art Deco style which frequently borrowed aspects of African design to create \u2018exotic\u2019 objects for European consumers. \n\nIn 1925 the African-American dancer Josephine Baker escaped the restrictions of the racially-divided United States to become a sensation in Paris. Her erotic dances and risqu\u00e9 costumes, which included a skirt made of bananas, found instant success amongst Parisian audiences enraptured with all things exotic, as too did her menagerie of pet animals which included Chiquita the cheetah. Baker became a design icon in her own right and appeared on many objects of the period. In this glass figure she is wearing her signature banana skirt.",

She performed at the Plantation Club and in the chorus of popular Broadway revues. In 1925 she opened in Paris at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, where her erotic dancing and 'exotic' costumes, which included a skirt of bananas, found instant success amongst a Parisian audience enraptured with all things 'African'. She became the most successful American entertainer in France, an achievement impossible in the racially-divided United States.",
