            "public_access_description": "This 'uchiwa-e' (rigid fan print) design by Hiroshige is from a series of scenes from classical literature. However, Hiroshige put them into contemporary settings. This print illustrates the Akashi chapter of The Tale of Genji (early 11th century). The text in the cartouche explains that Murasaki Shikibu wrote the tale while in seclusion at the Ishiyama Temple. She started to write on the 15th day of the eighth month, when her mind was as clear as the August moon reflected on Lake Biwa.\n \nHere you can see Prince Genji dressed in elaborate robes and sitting in a boat. The indeterminate background is typical of Hiroshige's work. The artist has depicted him with a small peak of hair just above his forehead. This is similar to how Genji is portrayed in the 'Nise Murasaki Inaka Genji'. This popular parody of The Tale of Genji was written by Ryutei Tanehiko and illustrated by Utagawa Kunisada I. It was published in instalments from 1829 to 1842, but was then suppressed as part of the Tenpo Reforms. \n\nAn interesting aspect of this print is the identification of Prince Genji in the yellow cartouche. This gives his name as Zaigo Chujo Minamoto no Hikaru. Minamoto no Hikaru, the 'Shining (Prince) of the Minamoto (Family)', is appropriate for Prince Genji. Zaigo Chujo, however, is the court title of Ariwara no Narihira, the hero of the earlier Tales of Ise. This confusion of names reflects how these two famous romantic figures of the Heian period (794-1185) were often combined in popular culture in the 19th century.",
