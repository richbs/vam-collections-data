She waves a rose-red scarf from her turret window to lure passers by who she seduces and then pushes down to the raging gorge below. This illustration shows Thamar seducing a handsome prince by dancing with him\n\nThe Ballet Thamar was created for Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes with choreography by Mikhail Fokine, music by Mily Balakirev and designs by L\u00e9on Bakst and first performed by the Ballets Russes on 20 May 1912 at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet, Paris. It was first performed by the Ballets Russes in London on 12 June 1912 at the Royal Opera House. It was performed at the end of the post War London Coliseum on 13 March 1919 when Lubov Tchernicheva took the title role as the Queen of Georgia and Leonide Massine was the stranger Prince. Tamara Karsavina returned to the title role she had created at the Alhambra Theatre in July 1919. \n\n\nThe illustration was drawn as the frontisepiece of Impressions of the Russian Ballet Thamar written by Cyril W Beaumont and decorated by Ethelbert White",
