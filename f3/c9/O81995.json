Full Citation:\n\n\u201cNICHOLAS HILLIARD\n\n<b>192 Elizabeth I</b>, c. 1585-87\n\n<i>Victoria & Albert Museum (P.23-1975)</i>\nVellum stuck onto plain card, oval, 45 x 37 mm, 1 \u00be x 1 15/32 in.\n\nAbout 1586-87 we have, for the first time, clear evidence of Hilliard multiplying the same miniature of the Queen.  Three versions are extant of this face-mask, the second, in the Drake Jewel, contains the regnal year enabling us to date it to 1586-87 (Strong, <i>Renaissance Miniature</i>, pl. 98) and the third is in the Beauchamp Collection (Auerbach, <i>Hilliard</i>, pl. 57).  None of the versions, including the V&A one, is from life.  All, however, observe the Queen\u2019s dresses and jewels correctly.  This version includes details such as the black picture box secured by an orange bow at her left breast and, more important, a very early allusion to her as the moon-goddess, Cynthia or Diana, in the crescent-jewel resting in her hair which is also scattered with tiny arrows (a further allusion to Diana, as goddess of the chase?).  The other early dated visual allusion to the moon-cult is the portrait of Sir Walter Raleigh, dated 1588, in the National Portrait Gallery (Strong, <i>Tudor and Jacobean,</i> I, pp. 256-57; II, pl. 505).\n\nBasically the miniature is in good condition with minor losses, oxidization of the silver and a little damage due to moisture.\n\nINSCRIBED: The miniature is set into a seventeenth century vellum mount with bands of lettering in black and gold; inscribed on either side: <i>ELISA. / BETHA; Regina / Angliae.</i>\n\nCOLLECTIONS:  This miniature once belonged to a group of ten, five of which are now in the V&A.  The earliest account of their history (Lord Ronald Sutherland Gower, <i>The Great Historic Galleries of England</i>, London, 1881, pl. xx) is highly romanticized and claims provenance from James II via Louis XIV which cannot be proved.  Their certain history is as follows: acquired in Paris by James Edwards (1757-1816), bookseller and bibliographer, probably in the aftermath of the Treaty of Amiens; sold Christie\u2019s July 15th 1816 (lot 61); acquired by the Rev. Thomas Butt of Kinnersley, Shropshire, who married Edward\u2019s widow; by descent to Capt. H. Edwards-Heathcote, Belton Hall, Market Drayton; sold Christie\u2019s June 13th 1928 (lot 45); purchased by Mrs Doris Herschorn; bequeathed, 1975.\n\nLITERATURE: V&A, 1947 (47).\nAuerbach, <i>Hilliard</i>, pp. 109, pl. 85; 30 (83).\nStrong, <i>Portraits of Queen Elizabeth I</i>, p. 90 (7).\u201d",
