Working outwards, the bands can be described as:\n[2] A wide white ground band carrying an elaborate black meander with spiky red and blue flowers.\n[3] a blue ground with a version of [1] with red flowers.\n[4] a wide white band carrying isolated, delicate floral spray emanating from a small vase, in four versions, in red and blue.\n[5] as [3] but with red ground.\n[6] a wide white band with a green leafy meander bearing large exotic blossoms in four versions including a stylised carnation in blue and red.\n[7] as [3]\n[8] a wide white band carrying inward facing cypress trees, alternately red or blue ground, containing a three flowered stem.  The ground is covered with delicate floral stems.\n[9] as [3] on a yellow ground.\n[10] a narrow reciprocal trefoil in red and blue.\nBacking: three pieces of the same fabric stitched together. It is machine-woven roller printed plain weave cotton. A delicate brown ogival lattice with a brown and blue flower at each junction, each containing exotic blossoms and bunches of grapes on fine brown stems coming from the lattice stem in four different designs.  There are two browns, blue, green and yellow.  The fabric was creased during the printing process and this has resulted in three blank areas.\nFacing: bias-cut, plain weave dark blue silk.",
