            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nThe 16th-century Reformation had dire consequences for stained-glass making in England. Throughout the period, Puritan hostility to 'distractive' imagery in stained glass meant that church windows suffered neglect and were often a target for vandalism. New stained glass was almost exclusively ordered for domestic interiors. Its subjects were restricted to non-biblical imagery such as heraldry and moral messages. True stained glass was increasingly replaced by enamel-painted white glass, the making of which  fell to Dutch and German artists.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThis roundel belongs to a group of panels painted with moralising images and accompanying Latin inscriptions. The inscriptions are taken from such literary sources as the Bible and the works of the Roman poet Horace (65-8 BC). Death and judgement were preoccupations of the Christian faith and were particularly popular subjects for glazing programmes from the 14th century onwards. Society's increasing preoccupation with the transience of human life is reflected in these windows. Their warnings were an ever present reminder to viewers to live more virtuous lives.\n\nPeople\nThis medallion was made to decorate the interior of Preston Hall near Lavenham in Suffolk. It was probably commissioned by  the antiquary Robert Ryece (1555-1638), the then proprietor. He was famous for his Breviary of Suffolk,  a description of the buildings, people and inhabitants of the county. Ryece was part of a close-knit group of prosperous local gentry of Puritan (strict Protestant) persuasion. He was interested in heraldry and is also known to have commissioned windows featuring the coats of arms of local gentry for Preston's parish church.",
