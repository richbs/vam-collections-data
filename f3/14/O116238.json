Each earring consists of a curved silver-gilt wire with a motif of three wired pearls in closed mounts arranged in a trefoil on its front.  The pendant hangs from a ring below the pearls.

The body of the basket is made from four rosettes of painted enamel, alternating red on yellow and pink on white, with green leaves between them.  The base of the basket is a turquoise enamel rosette.  Seed pearl pendants hang from the top and bottom edges of the basket, from the centre of its base, and from the top of the handle.
