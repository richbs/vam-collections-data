Most designs are associated with the well-known Rococo designer and carver Matthias Lock, but the album includes a number of designs which should probably be associated with a later Matthias Lock, recorded at Clerkenwell Green in 1788-1797, who is probably his son. These include neo-classical mirror designs, and designs for foliate ornament. In 1769, a Matthias Lock published A New Book of Foliage for the Instruction of Young Artists and A New Book of Pier Frame\u2019s, Oval\u2019s, Gerandole\u2019s, Tables, &c, all in the neo-classical style. This is presumably also the son. The neo-classical style and presentation of this chair design closely match the neo-classical mirror designs which have been attributed to the younger Lock. It is therefore possible that this chair design also belongs to the son. The album was bought from a descendant, probably his grandson, George Lock, and had been exhibited by him at the International Exhibition held at South Kensington in 1862.",
