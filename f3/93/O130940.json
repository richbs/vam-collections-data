Aged sixteen she married the dancer Armand Vestris and although they separated, she kept his name professionally. She made a name for herself in Paris and London, was famous for her 'breeches' roles, portraying men and revealing her well-shaped and much praised legs, which are the subject of this scurrulous ballad.\n\nAlthough she could have specialised in opera, Madam Vestris made her name in burlesque and comedy roles, making her earliest success in 1820 in a burlesque or parody of Mozart's Don Giovanni called Giovanni In London. She made a huge hit with The Broom Girl! which she first sang at the Haymarket Theatre in 1826.  She took over the Olympic Theatre in 1830, and after her marriage to Charles Matthews in 1838, also managed Covent Garden and the Lyceum Theatres for some time.",
