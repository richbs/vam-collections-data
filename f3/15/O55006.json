It was the most frequently copied Chippendale design. When chairs were made following Director patterns, as in this example, it is only the back that is copied from the published plate. The seat and legs tend to be treated much more conventionally.\n\nThe symmetrical carving on the back splat suggests that the chair was made from Chippendale's published design, although the execution of the back splat is more complicated than that shown in the design. This same chair design was shown in Thomas Malton's Treatise on Perspective, 1775. This may have helped sustain the popularity of this design.\n\nChippendale's notes to the plate recommend that the design should be carefully drawn to scale before carving. He indicates that the fabric used to cover such chairs usually matches the window curtains. The height of the chair back should never be more than 22 inches (56 centimetres) above that of the seat. The mahogany would have been imported from the West Indies.\n\nMany versions were made by furniture makers throughout Britain and overseas, in a wide range of qualities. Without evidence from bills and inventories it is impossible to date such chairs closely. We know that workshops were producing chairs of this pattern more than 30 years after the 'Director' was published.",
