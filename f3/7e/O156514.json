            "public_access_description": "The tortoiseshell panels of this box are set with burgau shell and gold, a technique known as laque-burgaut\u00e9. Burgau shell comes from the green sea snail (turbo marmoreus). It became very popular in the 1800s and 1900s in Europe for jewellery, fans, buttons and instrument inlay due to its clear, creamy colour and iridescence. However, the main fishing grounds became depleted and it is now little used. The technique originated in China during the Ming dynasty (1368-1644), where it was also used to cover unglazed porcelain and was also widely used in Japan in the Tokugawa period (1603-1867). \n\nThe gold mounts bear the mark of Louis-Gaspard Th\u00e9venot who was born on June 17, 1705, the son of a glass seller. He was apprenticed as a goldsmith at 15 and registered his mark in 1735. He appears to have had business difficulties - in 1740, Louis Lucas obtained a court order to sell his furniture, presumably to settle a debt and he went bankrupt owing over 8000  livres in 1755.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world\u2019s great decorative art collections, including silver,  mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
