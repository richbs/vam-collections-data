The seat is of wood, broad at the front narrowing at the back; it is padded and covered with dark olive green velvet.  The rounded back is formed from two lengths of cane which extend down to form part of the back legs.  The back is open and decorated with a bow pattern of twisted cane lengths.  The arms are formed from single lengths of cane which extend down to become part of the front legs.  All the legs are further strengthened by lengths of cane used as cross stretchers, as supports from the right front to right back and left front to left back, and from the right back to the left back legs.  The arms are supported by a loop of cane under each.  Thin strips of cane have been used to decorate the back, arms and part of each front leg.  To join parts together nails and tight binding of the thin cane have been used, (under each arms, in the back at the top and two sides, and around each foot).  The whole surface of cane has been stained dark brown though there has lighter patches due to wear.",
