In 1401, the Arte di Calimala (the guild of the merchant dealing in foreign cloth and export) decided to commission a second bronze door for the baptistery of Florence, to accompany the door completed by Andrea Pisano sixty-four years earlier. A competition was held for which seven competitors submitted trial reliefs of the Sacrifice of Isaac. The copy here is of Brunelleschi's competition entry which was rejected in favour of that of Lorenzo Ghiberti, who was awarded the commission for the Baptistry. The original of this relief is now in the Museo Nazionale (Bargello) Florence.",
