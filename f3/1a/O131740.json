The top, partly sloping, is formed of three boards running side to side which are bound by nine iron bands, the middle one of which is broken by a medallion pierced  with scrollwork, while similar ornaments are arragned between the other bands; the rest of the external surface is also strengthened  by bands, the sides being further fitted with semi-circular drop-handles and the front with a pierced lock plate. Inside is a compartment, the lid of which is formed by the back portion of the top, which is hinged to the back of the desk and to which in turn, the sloping portion is hinged; this compartment contains three wells, closed by lids, and two?three drawers (oak, nailed) below, which conceal a narrow upright softwood drawer. The bottom is formed of four thin boards running front to back.\n\nAlthough the some (at least) of the ironwork appears to be old, the wood boards forming the body of the desk all appear to be new (machine cut), and a dark stain applied over nailed mouldings - strongly suggesting that this is a modern assemblage incorporating old iron mounts, on an unrelated, heavily restored small table.",
