Designer Marcel Wanders believes that using archetypes in his designs helps to make the objects look familiar, so that consumers feel comfortable with them even when they are new and unusual.\n\nSet Up Shades was one of Wanders's earliest significant design projects. His ideas about archetypes were shared by many other Dutch designers in the 1990s, when a small version of Set Up Shades was selected for the highly influential Droog Design collection. This larger version was introduced in 2002 by Moooi, a company founded in Amsterdam in 2000. Marcel Wanders is the Art Director of Moooi, and designs the majority of the company's products.",
