This was the fourth of a series of quinquennial World conferences on Women (Mexico 1980, Copenhagen 1985, Nairobi, 1990). The posters were exhibited in Beijing at the time of the Conference and in London at the 'What Women Want' Festival at the Royal Festival Hall, in August, the same year. They were distributed across Europe by the United Nations Environmental Programme and also shown in Nairobi in January 1997. \n\nThis image comprises a tree in a landscape, overlaid with a quotation from the African American writer, Alice Walker. The somewhat unusual tree looks naked, stripped down and vulnerable, its branches appear to reach out to either side like supplicatory arms. Its virtual symmetry and its positioning against a wide but distant landscape lends it an hieratic quality which recalls religious iconography.  It seems to embody the inherent plea in Alice Walker's words.",
