Weltkunst, 15 November 2003. pp.1903-4\nLambert, Susan (ed.) <u>Pattern & Design: Designs for the Decorative Arts 1480-1980</u> London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1983\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n'<b>3.4.a Johann David Schubert (1761-1822)</b>\n\nPreliminary drawing for the figure of Charlotte in a design illustrating the episode of Charlotte giving her husband's pistols to Werther's servant from Goethe's novel <i>The Sorrows of Young Werther</i>. The completed design was used for the painted enamel-decoration on a saucer in a Meissen porcelain <i>t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate</i> tea and coffee service of about 1790.\n\nRed chalk. 18.8 x 14.1 cm\nGiven by M. Whitney\nE.545-1975\n\nLiterature: W. Pfeiffer, 'Die Werther-Illustrationen des Johann David Schubert', <i>Schriften des Goethe-Gesellsc</i><i>haft, 46</i>, Weimar, 1933.\n\nW.Pfeiffer, writing in 1933, recorded eleven watercolours and two vignettes of <i>Werther</i> subjects by Schubert in the Design Collection of the Meissen factory. They did not include, however, the subject to which this present drawing relates and which appears on the saucer exhibited with it.\n\nThese designs were produced in 1787-88 and were intended to serve as models for the enamel-painted versions used to decorate the porcelain. This drawing appears to be a preliminary sketch for the now lost or unrecorded finished watercolour serving as pattern for the subject depicted on the saucer. Its liveliness and its close correspondence to the figure of Charlotte as painted demonstrate its important role in the working-out of the design. It must be assumed that the ruled lines forming a border were added subsequently. They may well be a sign of the change in the drawing's status from a working design to a collector's piece.'",
