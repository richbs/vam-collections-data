The miniatures, set into this London-made box of 1817-18, were painted between 1800 and 1815 in France, during the vogue for 17th-century French enamel portraits. They are executed after original engravings of Cond\u00e9 (1662) and Turenne (1665) by Robert Nanteuil.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
