Extensive services became increasingly popular by the end of the 19th century. Jelly glasses in the design of this piece, in a matching service of 13 different shapes, were made by F. & C. Osler of Birmingham and sold at \u00a31.5.0 per dozen or 15d each.\n\nMaterials & Making\nEtching glass by drawing a pattern in a layer of wax on the surface of the glass and then plunging it into hydrofluoric acid was first practised in the late 18th century. The process was developed commercially in the 1840s. By 1861 John Northwood (1836-1909) and James Northwood (1839-1915) at Wordsley, West Midlands, were among the first major producers to use it extensively. They had earlier invented the template etching machine for inscribing the pattern through the wax. With the invention in 1864 of a gear-driven, geometric etching machine, interlocking patterns such as loops or the ever-popular 'Greek key' border patterns were applied to virtually all table glass. They were used especially on the new paper-thin glass that appeared in the 1870s.",
