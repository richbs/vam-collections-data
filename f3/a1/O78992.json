They were often carved with architectural motifs, such as scrolls, or with more decorative designs, such as the strapwork, swags and dolphins on this bracket.\n\nPeople\nWilliam Gibbs Rogers (1792-1875) was one of the prominent figures in the revival of woodcarving in the1840s and 1850s. He was highly skilled, capable of working in a range of styles including Gothic, the style of the 17th-century carver Grinling Gibbons, and of French designs of the 1740s. His son William Harry Rogers (1825-1873) was chief designer for his father and specialised in Renaissance-style designs, many of which were illustrated in contemporary periodicals such as 'The Art Union', 'The Art Journal', and 'The Builder'. This bracket is carved with his monogram.\n\nTime\nW.G. Rogers exhibited a large group of woodcarvings at the Great Industrial Exhibition of 1853 in Dublin. Many of his exhibits were examples of fashionable styles of the 1850s. They included a portrait frame carved with scrolls, flowers and trophies in the style of Louis XV, priced at \u00a321, a boxwood salad spoon and fork with stems of celery forming the handles (price \u00a35), and this bracket, priced at \u00a321.",
