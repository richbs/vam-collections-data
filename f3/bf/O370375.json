At the centre of the panel is a repetitive circular scrollwork pattern. This is interlaced with a strapwork motif. Framing the central design is an inlaid border created from two thin bands of ivory. In between these bands is a scrollwork design, carved in low relief. Each panel is carved with a subtle variation on the central design. Shallow grooves have been carved into the sides of each panel. One of the panels (1078A -1869) has fragments of red pigment on its surface, which suggests the group of panels may have been painted.",

They possibly date to the 13th century A.D. \nThese five panels were probably part of a cenotaph or a minbar (pulpit in a mosque). The carving on the panels is similar to that found on another panel owned by the V&A Museum Number 981-1883.\n\nThis object formed part of the Meymar collection \u2013 a collection of Islamic and Middle Eastern objects collected by the Turkish bureaucrat known as Dr Meymar who was based in Cairo in the 1860s.This collection was exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1867, from where the South Kensington Museum (V&A) made a large number of purchases to enhance their growing collection of Islamic art. Together with the collection of Gaston de Saint-Maurice (accessioned in 1884), the Meymar collection was the foundational collection of \u2018Saracenic\u2019 art \u2013 or the art of the Mamluks (ruled Egypt and Syria 1250-1517) \u2013 in this museum.",
