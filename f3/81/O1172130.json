The image is taken from a photograph by Ray Stevenson of a small ripped up souvenir flag, blown up and screen printed by Reid. The misuse of the nation's flag for the artwork of their first single shows the group's early confidence and ambition. The printing of this design on a handkerchief also deliberately invokes the old-fashioned image of the British working class man at the seaside with a knotted handkerchief on his head.  \n\nJamie Reid's cut-and-paste aesthetic, as seen in this design, developed from his interest in radical politics. His artistic style developed while at art college in Croydon, where he was influenced by the ideas of the avant-garde political group, the Situationist International. The political slant to his art was aroused by the May 1968 Paris student riots, which inspired fraternal protests organised by Reid at the Croydon College of Art. These were directed with fellow student Malcolm McLaren, who would later become the manager of the Sex Pistols.",
