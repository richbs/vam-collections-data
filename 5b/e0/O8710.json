The sequence started with Philippe le Hardi, or Philip the Bold (ruled 1364\u20131404). The Habsburgs were also shown in the case of Maximilian, Holy Roman Emperor from 1493, who married into the Burgundian line. The figures were all identified by coats of arms displayed below them.\n\nThe stained glass was removed in 1795 and shortly afterwards sold to a British dealer. Some of it was later installed at Kilburn Grange, a private house in north-west London. This was demolished in 1910. The Museum acquired the present panels (inv. nos C.438 to 439, 441 to 443-1918) in 1918, together with other coats of arms and a late figure of Charles V.\n\nThe ducal figures in stained glass now in the Chapel of the Holy Blood were made in the years 1845-7. They were based on watercolours of the originals.",

The glass from the Chapel was sold by the municipality of Bruges to a local man for a miniscule sum who then sold them, at great profit, to an English man in the early 19th century. Believe the glass ended up with firm of Watson & Bethell.\n\nIn 1913 they were owned by Grosvenor Thomas. He acquired them from Kilburn Grange which was erected after 1830. \n\nThere are coloured drawings of the windows, pre-dispersal, in the Chapel archives. In 1845 reproductions of the panels were made from these drawings by the glass painter Pluys.\n\nRackham, in a letter of 1921, says panels were previously in Kilburn Grange which had been pulled down 10 or 12 years ago [presumably meaning 1909 or 1911]. The family of Major Cecil Peters of Sunbury Manor, Sunbury in Middlesex, formerly owned Kilburn Grange.",

His heir was Mary but the Duchy of Burgundy was annexed by the French crown as there was no direct male heir. Mary retained, according to French law, only the Burgundian Netherlands and Franche-Comte. Mary married Maximilian by proxy within several months and he proceeded to secure the lands of the old Duchy back from the French crown. Although the Dukedom was officially lost, Mary and Maximilian's son, Philip the Fair, bore the titular honour of 'Duke of Burgundy'. Mary died in 1482 and her lands passed to Philip.",
