He had first been engaged as a designer by the Gobelins Manufactory in 1666. In 1690 Monnoyer was given leave to travel to England, ostensibly to tour the country for several months. In fact, the artist would remain there until his death in 1699, carrying out commissions he received from wealthy English patrons.\n\nThe series to which this tapestry belongs was executed in the style of Jean B\u00e9rain I (1640-1711), and came to be known as the B\u00e9rain Grotesques.The subjects' unifying feature is the light-hearted revelry they exhibit. They include acrobats, minstrels, animal tamers, an elephant; and offerings to Pan and to Bacchus.",
