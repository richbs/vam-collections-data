ISBN 1851773088.\nPurchased along with the outstanding ceramics in the Soulages collection, this vase is one of the earliest and most successful examples of Italian lustreware, a technique much admired and imitated in the late nineteenth century. Although depicted in Solomon Alexander Hart's painting of Giorgio di Pietro Andreoli, known as Maestro Giorgio of Gubbio (cat. 51), the vase was not attributed to him by J. C. Robinson, who described its unusually intense tint as \"approximating rather to the Hispano-Arab copper lustre than to the genuine ruby of the Gubbio school.\" C. D. Fortnum's catalogue of 1873 attributed the vase not to Giorgio but to an anonymous potter earlier identified by Robinson as the \"master or immediate predecessor of Giorgio.\" Maestro Giorgio's work was known primarily by his signed pieces, all dated within the range of 1518 to 1541. Recent archival research has shown, however, that as early as 1495 Maestro Giorgio entered a partnership with Maestro Giacomo di Paoluccio di Gubbio with the intention of producing \"vasi di maiolici,\" which at that date referred to lustre-decorated earthenware. In 1501 he signed another contract with Paoluccio for a duration of ten years, again to produce lustrewares. Now, for the first time in over a hundred years, it seems likely that Maestro Giorgio was depicted with his own vase after all. \n\nLit.
