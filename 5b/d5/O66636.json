With his right hand he makes the gesture of explanation (vyakhyanmudra) whilst embracing his consort Parvati with his left. His upper right holding a mala and scrolling padma with a cobra head resting on it; each wearing elaborate scrolling foliate jewelry, beaded necklaces and dhotis with incised floral decoration, each with elaborately knotted headdress, the whole in high relief, rampant leonine beasts and makara heads to either side, two apsaras above holding floral garlands with aureole border carved with an inner lotus petal border and outer band of exuberant scrolling foliage.",

            "public_access_description": "Siva and Parvati, with Siva represented as Vyakhyana-Daksinamurti, the divine exponent of the sastras, seated together on a lotus throne. The divine couple embody in gesture and expression the tender \u2018loving glance\u2019 of the snigdha mood. In this form Siva is the great exponent of the sastras, teaching the sages the meaning of yoga and jnana (knowledge). This subject was more popular in southern India than the north, and its specific appearance in 9th century northern Uttar Pradesh may be linked to the presence, at that time, of the great Tamil Saiva guru Sankara, who established a Hindu monastery (matha) at Joshimath, in Kumaon. \n\nSiva is seen seated in lalitasana, with a meditation cord (yogapatta) around his legs. With his lower hands he expounds the divine knowledge (vyakhyana-mudra) whilst embracing Parvati with the other; in his upper hands he holds a rosary (mala) and his weapon, the trisula. His pendant foot is supported by a lotus, beside which Nandin sits restfully. Parvati gently rests her extended hand on Siva\u2019s foot, whilst apparently pointing with the other to their son Kartikeya who tugs at her pendant belt. Her feet are supported by lotus, her lion below her left foot. Both gods are richly bejewelled, including with tripartite diadems, and wear finely patterned skirt-cloths.\n\nBeneath the lotus-throne appear the dancing skeletal figure of Camunda, Kartikeya on his peacock, and a seated obese figure, now damaged, but probably representing their second son, Ganesa. The composition is filled with other attendant and laudatory figures, including leonine beasts and makara throne uprights supporting a framing prabha of exuberant scrolling foliage, further enlivened with garland-bearing devas. A diminutive kneeling female figure, partly concealed behind Parvati\u2019s foot, may be accepted to represent the donor of this image. That a woman was the patron is not surprising \u2013 it is a remarkably skilfully conceived scene of intimate and tender domesticity.",
