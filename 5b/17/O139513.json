The Demerara was the second largest vessel in the world. In a nationally reported incident, she went aground on her way to have her engines fitted. Badly damaged, she was towed back into harbour and dry docked.\n\nThe photographer, Calvert Jones, was introduced to photography by a cousin of William Henry Fox Talbot, the British inventor of photography. Jones' work stands out in the early development of photography because of hid ability to fuse his new skill in photography with his experience as a marine watercolorist.",

Built in Bristol, the Demerara was the second largest vessel in the world. In a nationally reported incident, she went aground on the River Avon on her way to have her engines fitted. Badly damaged, she was towed back into harbour and dry docked as this photograph shows.\n\nThe photographer, Calvert Jones, was one of the few Britons to produce a substancial body of calotypes in Britain and abroad. He had been practising photography since 1839 He learned of the process through a cousin of W.H.F. Talbot, who was neighbour in South Wales and a close friend from Oxford.",

It was installed on the offices of an auctioneers at Quay Head, where it remained until the 1930s. When attempts were made to remove it before the building was demolished, it crumbled to pieces. The pineapple that the figure is holding survived and is in the collection of the Bristol Maritime Museum.\nThe building behind the figurehead is the gasholder from the Cannons Marsh gas works on the far side of the water.",
