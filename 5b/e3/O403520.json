He later succeeded Kipling as principal of the school and also as curator of the Punjab Museum. In Lahore, Andrews also met Aurel Stein, then principal of the Oriental College and Registrar of the new Lahore University, and it appears to have been Andrews who inspired Stein to turn his energies towards Asian archaeology and exploration. In 1898 he returned to England to take up the post of head of the art department at the People's Palace in Whitechapel, but in 1913 went to Kashmir as principal of the new Technical Institute at Srinagar, for which he also drew up plans.Andrews described this tile as coming 'from a tomb near Lahore'.",
