Many of these were created by Arnold Lever, their house designer. The brightly coloured slogans represent handwritten posters pasted onto a brick wall. A lively combination of warnings and exhortations to persevere courageously in the face of war, such as Churchill's 'We shall not flag or fail, we shall go on to the end', is punctuated by the reminder that 'Bill Stickers Will Be Prosecuted By Jacqmar'. Jacqmar was the first British scarf manufacturer to overtly display the company's signature on its products. Used as a wartime substitute for silk, rayon was a man-made fibre developed at the start of the 20th century.",
