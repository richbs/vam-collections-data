He raises a spoon to his mouth as if to taste the cooking. In the centre, another aproned man holds a long-handled ladle and a curved knife is tucked into his apron strings. On the left of the roundel a fire is blazing and placed within it and attached to rachets is a large cooking pot.

            "public_access_description": "This stained glass roundel was made after a design by the artist Jorg Breu the Elder who lived and worked in Augsburg in southern Germany from around 1475 to 1537. He is known to have painted altarpieces, panels and murals and to have designed book illustrations and stained glass. A number of his stained glass designs survive. Breu specialised in the production of monochrome glass roundels (painted simply in a black pigment with yellow (silver) stain added) and his designs were used throughout the 16th century.\n\nThis roundel depicts Coquinaria (the art of cooking) which is one of the 'Seven Mechanical Arts'. These seven Mechanical Arts (artes mechanicae) emerged as a complement to the academic seven Liberal Arts (artes liberales) first in the writings of John Scotus in the 9th century. By the 12th century, in the writings of Hugh of St Victor, cooking was included as one of these mechanical arts. It is known that Breu also designed roundels depicting Vestaria (weaving), Milicia (the military arts), Metalaria (metalworking), Venatio (hunting), Mercatura (mercantile art) and Architectura.\n\nThe stained glass design for this roundel is in the Staatliche Graphische Sammlung Munchen.",
