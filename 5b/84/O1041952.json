            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, pp. 202, 204, 209-210\n\u201cPage from a sketch-book.\n \nThe inscription on the back refers to the story of the ghost recounted on the back of No. 336 [304-1888]. In the letter quoted in the note on that drawing Constable continues: \n\"It is a beautiful and romantic old house; deeply fixed in trees and dells and filled with marble statues, dolphins, cupids, etc.\". Leslie comments: \"One of Constable's sketch-books contains a beautiful drawing in watercolours of the house, formerly Lord Lyttelton's, now belonging to Digby Neave, Esq. The view is taken from the lawn, which is decorated with statues, urns, etc\". Shirley (L. ed, S., p. 266) plausibly identifies No. 337 [236-1888] with the drawing thus described by Leslie: it accords with the description in every detail. \n\nNote on Nos. 336-340 and 346-350 [304-1888, 236-1888, 221-1888, 232-1888, 345-1888, 229-1888, 237-1888, 189-1888, 233-1888, 347-1888]\n\nAs the measurements and, where they exist, the watermarks show, Nos. 336, 337, 338, 339, 340, 346, 347, 348, 349 and 350 [see above] all come from the same sketch-book, which measures approximately 115 x 190 mm. and consists of Whatman paper of 1831.  The book was first used by Constable, as far as is known, on his visit to Mr. Digby Neave at Epsom in 1831 (Nos. 336 and 337 [304-1888 and 236-1888]). He used it again on his summer visit to East Bergholt in July 1832 (Nos. 338 and 339 [221-1888 and 232-1888]). A drawing in the British Museum (No. L.B. 19a, 112 x 188 mm.) is also dated from East Bergholt on 31 July 1832 and comes from the same sketch-book. He then took it to Englefield House (No. 340 [345-1888]) and the drawing of Theal, Berkshire, made on 25 August 1832, in the British Museum (No. L.B. 25a, 113 x 188 mm.), was made on this visit in the same book. Constable again took it with him to East Bergholt when he attended the funeral there of his friend John Dunthorne on 9 November 1832 (Beckett, I, p. 270) (No. 346 [229-1888]). The undated sheets from the book may be assumed to have been drawn whilst he was on one or other of these expeditions, or made near them in date. In particular, No. 347 [237-1888] may be taken to have been drawn on one of the two visits to East Bergholt, since the subject is so exactly in line with Constable's other studies and paintings of barges on the Stour. It may be presumed that Nos. 348 and 349 [189-1888 and 233-1888] represent scenes in the same vicinity. No. 350 [347-1888] is exceptional in the group, in being carried out in pencil and water-colour. Three undated drawings in the British Museum which appear from their style, subject matter and measurements to be from the same book are: \n\nL.B. 14 Men with a cart. (111 x 181 mm.) \nL.B. 25b House among trees. (112 x 188 mm.) \nL.B. 28a Landscape with trees and cattle. (111 x 187 mm.)\u201d",
