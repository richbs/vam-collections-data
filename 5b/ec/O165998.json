Other samples of the same design have been found on the walls of the Shrubbery, a house in Epsom, also in Surrey.  The design is similar to the kinds of embroidered pictures which were fashionable in this period; it may have been based on a contemporary tapestry, an embroidery or a painted cloth hanging. There is another fragment of the same paper, from the same source, in the collection (see E.2232-1974). This paper is related to another sheet showing a house and garden with a woman fishing, also in the collection (E.405-1968).",
