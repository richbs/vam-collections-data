They are usually decorated very simply. This example bears the words \u2018Honi Soit Qui Mal Y Pense\u2019 (\u2018Shame be to him who thinks evil of it\u2019). This was the motto of the Order of the Garter, which was established by the English king Edward III in the middle of the period 1300-1400. \n\nThe decorating technique used here was developed in the early part of the 14th century. It consisted of painting a compound of silver on the back of the glass which, after firing in a kiln, turns yellow. Many panels from the period 1300-1500 are decorated simply in yellow (silver) stain and highlighted with a brown/black pigment.",
