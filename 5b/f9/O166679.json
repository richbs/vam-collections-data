            "history_note": "During the 1830s William Henry Fox Talbot invented a way of making paper negatives and from them multiple paper prints. In doing so, he laid the foundations of modern photography. Calvert Richard Jones learned of these developments in 1839 through a neighbour, who was a cousin of Talbot. Jones made many pictures in the West of England and South Wales, where he lived. He also travelled widely, making photographs on the continent. Jones' work stands out in the early development of photography because he was one of the first to apply a schooled artist's eye to the medium.\n\nThis photograph is as much a portrait of the Inigo Jones designed summer house in the grounds of Margam Castle as it is of the owners Christopher Rice Mansel Talbot and his wife  Charlotte.The summer house is taken at the slightly oblique angle often chosen by Jones and this view is accentuated by the diagonal path in the foreground. Shadow increases the dominance of the horizontal elements on its fa\u00e7ade. The shallow arch above central entrance is surrealistically occupied by a dark shrub.",
