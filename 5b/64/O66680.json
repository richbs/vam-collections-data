The fragments all display parts of the human face and are shown together to illustrate different painting styles and techniques. \n\nThe featured fragment shows the decapitated head of a female saint and it appears as if it is being carried by her headless body. Below her head is the head of a young man bowed in mourning and below him appears to be the top portion of a nimbus, indicating that there is another saint depicted. This fragment perhaps formed part of a window dedicated to the life of the female saint but not enough survives to be certain.\n\nThe glass decorator has used a technique that was developed around the year 1300. This consisted of painting a compound of silver on the back of the glass which, after firing in a kiln, turns yellow. Many panels from the 14th and 15th centuries are decorated simply in yellow (silver) stain and highlighted with a brown/black pigment. It was a more economic way of achieving multiple colours on glass rather than leading together different pieces of coloured glass.\n\nIn the centre bottom of the panel, there is a fragment of an elderly man's head with lesions on his face indicating that he suffers from leprosy. He may have originally been part of a window that depicted acts of mercy to the poor and sick.",
