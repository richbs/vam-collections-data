It might therefore possibly be a ceremonial staff such as a stick-bearer (chobdar) carried.  Chobdars waited on people of quality, processed before them and announced visitors into their presence.  This stick also has a hilt, which suggests that it might have been intended for lakri, a combat game played with wooden sticks.   Indians in Lucknow learned and practised two types of lakri.  Ali mad was played by the ruling classes. It derived from the Persian martial art of phankainti in which each player kept the left foot fixed to one place.  Rustam khani was the less formal Indian variation of the sport, and players were allowed to change their positions.  This stick has delicate surface decoration, so it was probably for display rather than use.",
