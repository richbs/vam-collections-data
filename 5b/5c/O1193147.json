He had a long chart run during the 1970s, including 26 hit singles. Although he'd been a performer since the 1960s, he became synonymous with the flamboyant glittery suits and platform boots from the glam period. His singing career continued throughout the 80s and early 90s with many 'greatest hits' albums and revival shows, but he returned to major public attention in the late 1990s due to criminal convictions in the UK and Vietnam.",
