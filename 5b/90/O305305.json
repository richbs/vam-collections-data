            "physical_description": "The spinning wheel is decorated in imitation of Asian lacquer, with Chinese designs in gold on a blue background. The rectangular table, edged with raised and partly gilded beading, has a finely executed scene with a cockerel perched on a tree and a hen in a landscape of flowering shrubs, water and flying insects. The main elements of the scene are in low relief.  Details are added over the gilding in black. Some areas such as the cockerel's comb, were coloured red, now much rubbed.  The wheel and its supports are japanned blue with painted red and gold flowers. \n\nThe metal-edged wheel has eight finely turned spokes and a decorated rim, supported on two posts turned in a baluster shape. It has a brass handle with a painted wooden knob. A vertical spindle distaff (missing the metal top) is fixed to the front of the base with a turn screw. The maidens, upright turned posts supporting the flyer, are both missing. The flyer is adjusted with a turn screw in the end of the base. The flyer is brass, with hooks along the edges to guide the spun thread onto the bobbin.  A water pot (the lining missing) is attached to a turned arm behind the flyer.  \n\nThe mother-of-all, ie. the horizontal turned part which supports the maidens, is painted black and gold and is evidently a replacement. One of the turned supports for the wheel, on the side opposite the handle, has a greenish hue and has slightly different turning from the other support, so must also be a replacement.",

It is decorated with French varnishing imitating Asian lacquer, a technique known in Britain as japanning.  In France, '<i>Vernis Martin</i>' is used as a generic term for high quality French Rococo varnish decoration. Two generations of the Martin family worked in Paris, the eldest being the first French varnisher to receive the title '<i>vernisseur du Roy</i>' (varnisher to the King) in 1725. However most French varnishers remain anonymous since they did not sign or mark their work, and it is not known who decorated this spinning wheel.  Vernis Martin used a clear, durable varnish derived from copal, a tree resin grown in tropical countries.",

            "historical_context_note": "This spinning wheel was designed for spinning fine fibres, probably silk, or possibly flax, into thread.  The fibres were attached to the tall distaff and fed by hand  into the flyer. The small water pot was used to dip the fingers into, in order to dampen and smooth the fibres as they were spun. The rotation of the flyer twisted the fibres into thread, which then wound onto the bobbin.  A cord around the flyer whorl connected it to the wheel, which was was operated by turning a handle. Small spinning wheels such as this one were used on the lap. The user would feed the fibres into the flyer with her left hand while turning the wheel with her right. \n\nSpinning flax on larger, wooden spinning wheels, for weaving into linen, was an essential rural craft. It was traditionally carried out by women, hence the adjective 'distaff' to refer to the female side of a family.  For wealthy women, however, spinning on miniature, beautifully made spinning wheels became a popular pastime. In 1770 the Duchess of Northumberland, when staying in Paris, recorded in her diary that she had accompanied Lady Berkeley to the Boulevards, 'where I believe she had 100 Spinning Wheels brought into the Coach to chuse of.'
