            "public_access_description": "Jean-Antoine Houdon (1741-1823) is generally recognized as the pre-eminent European portrait sculptor of the last half of the 18th century. He excelled in penetrating portrayals of the great intellectual, military, and political figures of the Enlightenment, as well as portraits of children. He was also masterly in conveying textiles and other textures in carved marble, and this is a good example of that aspect of his work.\n\nIn this marble bust, signed by Houdon and dated 1775, Armand-Thomas Hue de Miromesnil is shown in the robes of a magistrate. The bust, which was exhibited in the Salon of 1775, probably commemorated the appointment that year of Miromesnil to be Garde des Sceaux (Minister of Justice). He wears a stiff and voluminous wig, his gaze slightly turned to his left.\n\nA second marble version of this bust, signed and dated 1777, is in the Frick Collection, New York, and there is a later unsigned marble version in the Mus\u00e9e Fabre, Montpellier.",

On 24 August 1774, Miromesnil had received the seals of the powerful office of <u>Garde des Sceaux</u> (Minister of Justice) from the King, Louis XVI. This bust was probably commissioned by Miromesnil to commemorate his appointment to this position.  \n\nThe V&A bust has a broken (repaired) nose and deep fissure in the marble at the left shoulder. Poulet has suggested that because of these flaws, Houdon kept it in his studio until his death. The flawless version in the Frick (inv. 1935.2.78), signed and dated 1777, was acquired by Miromesnil and remained in his family until the early 20th century.\n\nFrom the Ren\u00e9 Fribourg Collection, bought at Sotheby's for \u00a32000, in 1963.
