            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nThe pastry fork was a Victorian invention. The complicated dining etiquette of the period encouraged the development of specific utensils for eating particular foods. Pastry-based desserts were always eaten with a fork. The Habits of Good Society, written around 1859 to give guidance on etiquette, was adamant on the use of a fork for this purpose. ' What! A knife to cut that light, brittle pastry? No, nor fingers, never. Nor a spoon - almost as bad. Take your fork, sir, your fork!' Pastry forks had one broader prong (or tine) with a sharper, blade-like edge for cutting.\n\nDining Etiquette\nDining etiquette formed an important part of the Victorian code of polite society. The Manners and Tone of Good Society, first published in 1879, outlined the correct conduct of the dinner party but focused on the complicated and changing use of cutlery. With a few exceptions, such as for eating bread and some fruit, it frowned on the idea of touching food with the fingers. Around this time diners were being faced with an alarming and growing range of specialist utensils for eating particular foods. It was important to be able to recognise lobster picks, pastry forks and grape scissors and to know how to use them correctly.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe pattern on the handle of the fork is known as Vine and was popular for decorating dessert ware from its introduction in the early 19th century.\n\nManufacturer\nFrancis Higgins & Son rose to great prominence in the silver trade for the quality and ingenuity of their work as specialist spoon and fork makers.",
