This is the only known example in gold. Its sides were formed from a single seamed sheet of gold. The pristine condition of the case suggests that it was a cabinet piece rather than intended for regular use. \n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver,  mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
