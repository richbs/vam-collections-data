This plaque was made at Mme.Veuve (widow)  Dumas' factory in Paris and was shown in Messrs.Genlis & Rudhardt's gallery at the international exhibition, Paris,1867.  The gallery, with premises at rue St. Maur-Popincourt, advertised itself as specialising in art faience and paintings. The Dumas factory, at rue Fontaine au Roi 66, supplied blank panels for decorating to J-T Deck, for example.  In his report, Leon Arnoux, an expatriate Frenchman then working at Mintons' porcelain factory, singled Bouquet out for praise. The plaque was in the reference collection of Colin Minton Campbell, that was assembled for inspiration and the instruction of the artists working at the Minton factory.",
