Unlike pile carpets, the weaver works from the back of the fabric and the weft does not pass continuously from side-to-side but is worked backwards and forwards in small areas to create the blocks of colour required by the design. In its simplest form this produces a vertical slit between the differently coloured areas and these make kelims vulnerable to wear.   By using a design such as this, with as many diagonal lines as possible, the weavers are able to avoid large slits between blocks of different colour.",
