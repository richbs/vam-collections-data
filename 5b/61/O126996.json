He subscribed to the values outlined by Antonio Sant\u2019Elia, and wrote his own \u2018Manifesto of Futurist Architecture\u2019 in 1920, shunning the classical past in favour of the novelty of advancing modes of transport and construction. He worked on theatre and film sets and was one of a group of artists associated with Noi, a review edited by Enrico Pampolini. \n\nMarchi\u2019s signature on the bottom right of the photograph suggests that this image was intended as a promotional object for fans. Marchi looks determinedly out of the photograph, resembling a 1930s gangster. The film star-style presentation and dramatic shadow underline Marchi\u2019s connections with movements in 1930s culture \u2013 film, futurism and design.",
