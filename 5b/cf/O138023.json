The subject matter is a classic theme in Pahari painting with Vrindaban depicted as an idyllic forested landscape and the gopis as young, beautiful maidens all happily enjoying the amorous attentions of Krishna. Caur\u2019s interpretation is a reflection of the contemporary decay of this fabled city, the gopis have aged and are wearing widows clothes, the landscape is plain with the flags possibly alluding to it\u2019s glorious past.",

It was here that the Hindu god Krishna had his adolescent adventures with the <i>gopis</i> (cowgirls). The subject matter is a classic theme in Pahari painting with Vrindaban depicted as an idyllic forested landscape and the <i>gopis</i> as young, beautiful maidens all happily enjoying the amorous attentions of Krishna. Caur's interpretation is a reflection of the contemporary decay of this fabled city, the <i>gopis</i> have aged and are wearing widows clothes, the landscape is plain with the flags possibly alluding to it's glorious past.",
