A caloype was a paper negative and the process was invented by William Henry Fox Talbot in 1839. The photographer, Calvert Jones, was introduced to the process by a cousin of Talbot and by close friends who lived near to Jones in South Wales. \n\nJones' work stands out in the development of early photography because of his ability to fuse his new skill in photography with the influence of his training as a watercolorist. Taken at an angle to the buildings, the photograph with carriages and a basket by the foreground railings conforms to contemporary rules of composition. Many of Jones' photographs in Bristol focus on buildings of antiquarian interest. Exceptionally this photograph may be an early example of photo reportage: these assembly rooms had just been replaced with new larger rooms further down the hill towards the city centre.",
