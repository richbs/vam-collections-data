The full wrist-length sleeves are gathered into piped armholes, and each finishes in a band and frill of white cutwork to match those used on the bodice.  The bodice, which is lined with white cotton, is gathered into the waistband for a pouched effect; the plain full skirt is also gathered into the waist.  The garment fastens at the back of the bodice with five pearlised buttons and stitched buttonholes, and with drawstrings of white cotton tape at the neck and waist.",
