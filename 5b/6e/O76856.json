This square edge is in turn framed by a slightly raised platform with a slanting, slightly rounded rim.\n\nAt the centre of the dished area, a human-headed bird (the Simorgh) is engraved on a scrolling ground framed by a circular band with four pointed knots marking the cardinal points.  The Simorgh wears a three-pointed head-dress and its head is surrounded by the 'halo of glory'.  Its flowing tail curves upwards.\n\n The four triangular corners in the spandrels each enclose a single foliate scroll.\nThe rim is engraved at the corners with lotus-bud-shaped escutcheons and in the centre of each side, elongated cartouches with incurving sides frame inscriptions.\n\nPatina: deep brown with slight red undertones due to oxidation. The surface seems to have been oiled by the excavators and has become newly oxidised as a result of being kept in humid conditions prior to acquisition by the museum.",
