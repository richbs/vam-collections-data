Wedgwood, however, was the first person to manufacture them in stoneware on a commercial scale.  \n\nUse\nThis medallion of Wedgwood's partner was made as the pair to one of Wedgwood himself (museum no. 454-1890). They were made for personal reasons and were probably not intended to be reproduced commercially. The earliest of these medallions were probably given to close friends of the two partners. Later, after the firm had become famous, others were made using the original moulds. They were probably hung on walls in wood or brass frames or stored in cabinets.\n\nPeople\nThomas Bentley (1730-1780) was a Liverpool merchant. He was Wedgwood's close friend from 1762 and four years later became his partner in the manufacture of ornamental pottery. Bentley's cultivation, taste, contacts and diplomacy were of vital importance for the partnership's success. Wedgwood's adoption of classical forms and prototypes during the 1760s and 1770s was probably largely due to Bentley's influence. Most of Wedgwood's greatest technical achievements, and his greatest successes as an entrepreneur, were made during the years of his friendship with Bentley.",
