The book contains samples of almost every kind of wallpaper and wallcovering then available. These include Anaglypta and Lincrusta Walton embossed wallcoverings (the WPM had taken over Lincrusta Walton in 1905), boldly coloured Art Deco papers and borders, both floral and geometric. There are also examples of 'cut out' floral border and corner pieces, ready-varnished 'sanitary' papers (with patterns imitating marble, tiles, mosaic and wood grain), plain-coloured textured papers, and satin finishes. There are also two nursery wallpaper patterns. Throughout the book, illustrations of interiors hung with the various papers have been tipped in.",
