Until the early years of the reign of George III (1760-1820), the detachable cup-shaped lid of the earlier type of tea caddy was used to measure the tea into the teapot.  The earliest caddy spoon, specifically designed for this task, appeared in the 1760s; over the next 100 years large numbers were produced, particularly in Birmingham.\n\nDesign & Designing\nEvery form of shell and leaf shape was employed in the design of the caddy spoon.Spoons  were produced in contemporary flatware patterns or in quite individual styles with an incredible variety of decoration: they could be embossed, chased, engraved, bright cut (faceted to create a sparkling effect), fluted or left plain. The caddy spoon was usually 2-3 inches in length since the spoon had to fit inside the caddy.\n\nFood & Drink\nFormal afternoon tea, which would be taken around 4 o'clock, became established during the second half of the 19th century.  It was a polite occasion consisting of tea and coffee served with delicate snacks such as small sandwiches, cakes and cheesecakes and thinly cut bread and butter. The taking of afternoon tea at home, like the establishment of lunch as a formal meal, was another invention of the Victorian middle class.",
