The development of man-made fibres in the early 20th century presented new challenges for textile designers and technicians. Initially those manufacturers specialising in furnishing fabrics were hesitant to use the new fibres, but gradually started to combine them with natural yarns to produce soft furnishings which sold readily. Rayon was used to provide bright design highlights, while the other materials used supplied warmth, softness and strength to the fabric. \n\nThis example was produced by the firm of Warner & Sons Ltd., who were one of the leading 19th and 20th century silk weavers and cotton printers. It was advertised by the manufacturer, Warner & Sons as being 'suitable for ecclesiatical use'.",
