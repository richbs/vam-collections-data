He was born in Hereford, came to London in 1737 to work as a wine merchant but made his London debut as an actor at Goodman's Fields as Richard III in 1741. He managed the Theatre Royal Drury Lane from 1747 until 1776 and was depicted in many of his most famous roles during his lifetime, especially in paintings by Johann Zoffany (1733-1810). Garrick appeared for the first time as Hamlet in an August 12, 1742 and was his most performed tragic role. This mezzotint is after a painting by Benjamin Wilson of David Garrick in Act 1, scene 4, astronished and drawing back from the Ghost.",
