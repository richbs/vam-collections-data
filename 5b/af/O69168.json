The composition is based on classical sculptures and wall painting of this subject. The specific source was probably a sculpture in the collection of Cardinal Borghese in Rome, which was restored in the early seventeenth century with the addition of flowers in the hands of the outer figures (as here), and which was reproduced in a print of 1680 by N. Sandrart. A drawing showing a similar composition, possibly a preliminary design for the group, survives at the Meissen factory. This is dated 1784 and has been attributed to J.E. Schenau, who ran the Meissen drawing school, and more recently to the modeller of this piece, C.N. J\u00fcchtzer. The figure group was entered into the factory\u2019s model book in December 1784, and in the following year J\u00fcchtzer exhibited a biscuit porcelain example at a Dresden art exhibition. By1789 the factory moulds required repair by J\u00fcchtzer, which probably indicates that the model was a popular one and that the moulds had worn out.",
