The inside of the cap contains a spare lamp wrapped in a piece of sponge rubber for protection. The battery spring sits within a chamfered, internal rim. The main part of the body is a cylindrical barrel. The middle section is finely cross hatched to facilitate the grip. The switch is near the head and is covered by a domed rubber seal which sits within an oval scooped depression. The head screws on to the end of the barrel and is of greater diameter to the barrel, gradually reducing to that of the main barrel at the rear. A milled collar, similar to that on the tail cap, is just below the rim of the head. The lamp sits in the end of the barrel and is secured by a retaining collar. The head has a rubber O ring round the threaded rim. The reflector, of plastic with a mirrored concave surface sits within the rim. This is covered by a clear lens, retained in the face cap by another O ring which in turn sits within the threaded internal rim of the cap. In operation, the beam can be changed from an intense spotlight to a wide flood beam by rotating the head.",
