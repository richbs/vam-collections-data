            "public_access_description": "The African American actor Ira Aldridge (1807-1867) was born in New York where he was involved as a student with the African Theatre. He made his first London appearance in the East End, in May 1825 at the Royalty Theatre, Whitechapel, as Othello. In October 1825 he played the enslaved West African Prince Oroonoko at the Coburg Theatre, billed as 'Mr. Keene'.  By April 1833 he starred at Covent Garden as Othello, and a month later was at the Pavilion, billed as 'the African Roscius', playing Othello in mid-May, and two weeks later the vengeful Moorish Prince Zanga in Alonzo of Castile, a version of Young's play The Revenge. Aldridge's versatile repertoire encompassed comic and tragic parts, and white roles including Shylock and Macbeth. A good singer, he even accompanied himself on the guitar performing ballads and minstrel songs, some made famous by his contemporary T.D. Rice (1808-1860).\n\nIra Aldridge found fame in Europe as well as Great Britain. He made several continental tours and died on a tour in L\u00f3dz, Poland, where he is buried in the Evangelical cemetery.",
