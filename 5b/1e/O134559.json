The successful musical by Otto Harbach and Oscar Hammerstein Junior, with music by Rudolf Friml and Herbert Stothart, opened in London at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane in March 1925 and ran there for 851 performances, after it had first opened to rave reviews the previous September in New York.\n\nThe Redskin Totem-Pole Girls who Rose Marie sees dancing near Totem Pole Lodge in Kootenay Pass in the Canadian Rockies were one of the hits of the spectacular piece.  A chorus of over fifty girls danced the 'Totem Tom-Tom' number in the colourful Redskin outfits reproduced for this doll, topped with large hats resembling the carved animal heads on the totem poles on the set.  Reviewers at the time marvelled at the choreography of the number as the perfectly-drilled chorus of girls gyrated, swayed, leaned and fell in unison like a pack of cards or corns of ears blowing in the wind.",
