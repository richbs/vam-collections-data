            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nMiniature painting in England was predominantly a portrait art.  But from the late 1620s Peter Oliver (possibly born in 1594, died 1647) also painted subject pictures in miniature. These are called 'Histories in limning' (limning was the traditional word for miniature) in Edward Norgate's treatise on miniature painting, entitled Miniatura; or, The Art of Limning. Norgate (born in the 1580s, died 1650)  was a contemporary of Oliver. \n\nPeople\nAs Norgate explained in his treatise, such subject miniatures were unknown in England until 'of late years it pleased a most excellent King to command...some of his own pieces, of Titian...to be translated into English limning, which indeed were admirably performed by his Servant, Mr Peter Oliver'. Charles I (ruled 1625-1649)  was a great connoisseur and collector. He had a magnificent collection of oil paintings. His command to have them copied in miniature reflects the value he placed on both  his collection and miniature painting, a highly prized and exquisite watercolour art.\n\nThis miniature is a copy of  a picture that was in the collection of Charles I and is now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna.  Charles I employed the Dutch wax-modeller Abraham van der Doort (born around 1575-1580, died 1640) to look after his collection of paintings. Van der Doort described the painting as by Titian, the Venetian painter (possibly born around 1485, died 1576). It has recently been suggested that the painting may be by  Palma Vecchio (born around 1479, died 1528).  Interestingly,  the original oil has been repainted at some point so that Lucretia's chemise covers her breast.\n\nSubject Depicted\nThe subject is taken from ancient Roman history. Lucretia informed her family that she had been raped by Tarquin, son of the Roman tyrant. She then virtuously took her own life. The incident led to a rebellion against Tarquin's family.",

Referred to confidently by Van der Doort (3) as by 'Tichin\", it was accepted as by Titian until Waagen, Crowe,  Cavalcaselle et al. advanced the attribution to Palma Vecchio, which has since generally been preferred. The Oliver copy has been held to record the appearance of the Vienna picture before the latter was bowdlerised by the repainting of Lucretia's chemise to conceal her breast. (4) \n \nMore recently, however, Philip Rylands has given the Vienna picture back to Titian, commenting that the paint is 'quite unlike Palma's comparatively dry manner ... The parted lips and the upward gaze of the Lucretia give her a dramatic force which cannot be found in any of Palma's women.' He also takes a more sanguine view than Wethey of the soundness of the picture surface, denying that Lucretia's left breast has been bowdlerised. Instead, Oliver 'wilfully raised the girl's armpit and painted a nipple somewhat above the chemise'.\" Rylands's view appears to be supported by another early copy of the painting, in plumbago by David Paton, dated 1668, (7) in which the chemise decently covers Lucretia's nipple. The latter cannot however have been copied directly from the painting, because by 1668 the painting had left the country. \n \n Van der Doort refers also to a limned copy after it by Sir James Palmer which is not now known.\" Roy Strong (9) has suggested that the present miniature is itself the missing Palmer, being in his view of much poorer quality than the rest of the Oliver copies in the Royal Collection and having also had 'a very early Oliver signature' substituted for the original Palmer monogram which putatively would have been removed from the patch of disturbed background above Tarquin's shoulder. \n \n Although the application of Occam's razor is always tempting, in this instance it is difficult to accept that there were not two miniatures, the Palmer having broken up and been replaced by the Oliver. Van der Doort dearly says that the Palmer was already in bad condition when he catalogued it in the 1630s: 'which by vernishing the greene Cullors over flowen and the ground wrinckled'. Evidently Palmer had adapted the flooded-wash technique normally used for red-curtain backgrounds to achieve a suitable effect for the fabric of Lucretia's dress. To gain added lustre he had probably used too much gum, which had then cracked and perhaps contracted some part of the carnation ground. Although there is no mention of a second copy in Van der Doort, it is a sensible assumption that Oliver's version was intended to replace this unsound copy by Palmer. There is no evidence of any experimental or especially lavish use of medium in the present miniature, and certainly no evidence of massive repainting. Stylistically, in the softness of the stipple and the lack of linear definition to the forms, the miniature seems to relate satisfactorily to Oliver's latest works. It could even have been painted by Oliver for the King after Van der Doort's death in 1640, and not been formally inventoried - as other and greater events supervened until 1687 /8.  \n \nThe subject of Tarquin and Lucretia must anyway have seemed increasingly uncomfortable at Court as the 1630s proceeded. The story is originally from Livy and celebrates the fortitude and virtue of Lucretia, the fall of the Roman monarchy and the foundation of Republican liberties. Lucretia, the daughter of the Roman citizen Lucretius and wife of Tarquinius Collatinus, attracts the lust of Sextus Tarquin, the son of Tarquinius Superbus, King of Rome. One night Sextus forces her to submit to his desires by threatening to kill both her and a slave, and by threatening to tell her husband that he had found them in bed together. In the morning Lucretia reports this to her husband and father, charges them to avenge her and stabs herself. On hearing of her fate, the citizens of Rome rise up against their oppressive monarchy and establish in its place the Republic.  \n \nDespite the wide currency of the story in Renaissance and subsequent literature (not least through Shakespeare), misinterpretation of this scene has occurred. The problem is that both men, the husband and the rapist, bear the name of Tarquin, and both the major scenes of the story - the rape and the suicide - accordingly tend to be called 'Tarquin and Lucretia'. Titian did indeed paint the rape scene' (10) but here he (or Palma) paints the suicide. Lucretia takes the knife to stab herself. The sad and sensitive face looking over her shoulder is that of the virtuous husband Tarquinius Collatinus. \n\n1 Transcribed in Vertue IV, p. 89. \n2 Ex Gonzaga; purchased for the Archduke Leopold wilhelm at the Whitehall sale in 1651.\n3 Ashmole MS; Millar 1958-60, p. 22. \n4 Wethey 1969-75, vol..
