He collaborated with P. J. Naftel in illustrating \"The Channel Isles\" by D. T. Ansted, 1862, and the following reference to him is made in the preface: \"Of Mr. Peter Le Li\u00e8vre, whose pictures are only known to those who have visited his studio in Guernsey, it may safely be said that his success in art is not less remarkable than his familarity with the details of Natural History. Ample proof of both will be found in the following pages.\"\n\nIt is possible that the ilustration on p. 184 of the work mentioned above may be a wood-engraving made from the sketch on f.3 (<i>verso</i>) of the sketch-book.\"",
