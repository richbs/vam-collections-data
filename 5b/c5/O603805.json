            "bibliography": "Caerlaverock Castle is one of Scotland\u2019s great medieval fortresses. For 400 years it stood on the very edge of the kingdom. To the south, across the Solway Firth, lay England. For most of its history, Caerlaverock played an important role in the defence of the realm. Its triangular shape is quite unique among British castles. The reason for this design is not known and has been widely speculated. A walk around the castle gives a sense of its strength, its economy of form and its pleasing geometry. Three lengths of defensive curtain wall are linked at their three angles by high corner towers. The north tower, facing into Scotland, is an impressive twin-towered gatehouse. Down the years the Maxwell lords (Maccuswell) repaired and upgraded their ancestral castle. The formidably impressive slotted defences (machicolations) at the tops of the three towers date from the late 14th/early 15th century, after the ravages of the Wars of Independence with England had taken their toll. Inside the castle walls stands the remarkable Nithsdale Lodging, built in the 1630s by Robert Maxwell, 1st Earl of Nithsdale. Its attractive fa\u00e7ade, embellished with ornate Renaissance stone carvings, contrasts wonderfully with the severity of the ancient castle walls. Caerlaverock was besieged and captured on numerous occasions. However, two sieges stand out. Firstly, in July 1300, Edward I of England himself brought the full might of his army to bear on the stronghold, and the small garrison surrendered within two days. The detailed account of that siege is one of the most fascinating recorded for any British castle at that time. The second siege, in 1640, was the castle\u2019s last. It was brought about by Lord Maxwell\u2019s adherence to Charles I in that monarch\u2019s struggles with the Covenanters (religious dissenters). On that occasion the garrison held out for thirteen weeks before surrendering. Following the siege, the castle was stripped of all its valuable fixtures and fittings, and the great south curtain wall was demolished to render the defences useless.",
