It is designed in the western-style, largely popularized by cowboy movies in the United States in the 1940s and 50s and often awarded to winners in rodeo events as prize medals or trophies. The large, flat surface of the belt buckles make them a popular ornament, and this style has permeated American rock music (particularly metal genres). \n\nCheap Trick, formed in 1974, created a substantial fan base through their own brand of power pop music with a hard edge. The Los Angeles Times has remarked that \"Cheap Trick gained fame by twisting the Beatlesque into something shinier, harder, more American.\"",
