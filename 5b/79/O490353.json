The garment is cut in the traditional Chinese manner but with several variations which were the fashion in the 1920s. The waist is slightly shaped, the sleeves are three-quarter length and flare towards the wrist, and the hem is arc-shaped. There is a pocket sewn to the inside flap, and a hook for hanging it up sewn to the back of the neck.\nThe material has a turquoise satin ground which is patterned with large-scale floral and foliage sprigs predominantly in silvery-white and pink. The five loop and knot buttons are made from the same material.\nThe jacket is lined throughout with pale green, plain weave silk and it appears to be hand sewn.\n[Skirt] The skirt, which matches the jacket, is cut straight but fairly wide. It would probably not have appeared straight when worn because it would have had to have been bunched up at waist level to secure it. The waistband is of patterned cotton and as it is formed into a tube it may have contained a drawstring. There are no fastenings.\nThe skirt is lined with pale blue silk satin.",
