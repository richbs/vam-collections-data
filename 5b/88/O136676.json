            "public_access_description": "Rupert Potter (1832-1914), father of the children's author and illustrator Beatrix Potter, was himself an art practitioner and collector. In the 1860s he became fascinated with the new art of photography and was elected a member of the Photographic Society of London and contributed to its annual exhibitions. He also enjoyed drawing and filled a sketchbook in 1853 with humorous caricatures of his fellow law students at Lincoln's Inn and with fantasy sketches of animals, including a dog smoking a pipe and a duck wearing a bonnet - a forerunner, perhaps, of the famously simple Jemima Puddle-duck.\n\nRupert nurtured his daughter's extraordinary artistic talent and power of observation. In particular, he encouraged her to develop her eye and hand by copying outlines in the popular drawing manuals of Vere Foster. These drawing books, published by Blackie & Son, comprise a booklet of outlines with blank paper alongside for copying. The Victoria and Albert Museum holds several of Beatrix's juvenile copies from Vere Foster's Drawing Books, some reproduced as transfer prints on paper. \n\nRupert, too, copied outlines of birds from Vere Foster's Drawing Books, including this drawing of a grey linnet, reproduced as a transfer print on linen.  These prints were probably made by putting the original ink drawing, while still wet, face down on a gelatine film so that some of the ink was transferred to the gelatine. The original was then removed and the gelatine used as a printing surface. Rupert also used this method to produced ceramic plates for the nursery of 2 Bolton Gardens, examples of which can be seen in the hall of Beatrix's former home at Hill Top in the Lake District.",
