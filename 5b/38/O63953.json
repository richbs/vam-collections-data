The paper was pasted on the walls, and on the floor Gallaccio made an oblong 'carpet' comprising one ton of Valencia oranges which gradually decayed over the duration of the show (31 May - 22 June 1990). Gallaccio has often used natural materials - such as flowers, fruit, and ice - as her raw materials, to create temporary 'paintings' and sculptures in which the process of deterioration and decay is an integral part of the work.",
