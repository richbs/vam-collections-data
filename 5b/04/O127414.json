Cruikshank was engaged by the publishing entrepreneur John Cassell to produce a series of illustrations for a pirated edition of the novel by Harriet Beecher Stowe, Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin, and to spearhead its publicity campaign. The novel, which tells the story of Uncle Tom, a long-suffering African American slave, was first published in serial form in 1851 and became the best-selling book of the 19th century. The edition illustrated by Cruikshank was one of the most popular and long-lived.\n\nUncle Tom\u2019s Cabin is often credited as a driving force behind America\u2019s anti-slavery movement. However, the influence of popular contemporary theories of scientific racism is evident in the way in which characters in the book are reduced by both novelist and illustrator to racial 'types'. The character of Uncle Tom, in particular, who passively accepts his fate, contributed to the negative stereotyping of black people.",

Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2000. pp.174-176, p.175 (ill)\n\u2018[Cruikshank] produced a large and beautifully drawn etching, presumably an advertising broadside for Cassell\u2019s edition of Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin. The design is formally disciplined: divided into two strict geometrical sections, a lower rectangle surmounted by a triangle, or pyramid. The pyramid is capped by the figure of Eva bearing a laurel wreath, with which she is about to crown Stowe, whose ringleted bust, enclosed in an oval frame or shield, dominates the design and stares the viewer squarely in the face. Along the diagonal to Eva\u2019s right, in supplication, stands Miss Ophelia, while beneath her is Tom, hands clasped, and below him the kneeling Chloe accompanied by a black infant. On the balancing diagonal to Eva\u2019s left is a grimacing Topsy, followed by a very white George, Eliza and Harry Harris. Again, the woman and child kneel. The support for this pyramid consists of a rectangle depicting a female with a lamp, presumably representing reason, but reason in the guise of Eva. She illuminates, and dispels, typical scenes of plantation horror, inevitably featuring the flagellation of a topless female.\u2019",
