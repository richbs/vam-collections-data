Around the panels are rows of small studs, filling the lower corners of the panels are six animal masks in low relief. The upper corners of the panels filled with trefoil patterns, topped by a classic scroll around the shoulder. On the neck between the masked handles are two openwork foliated panels enclosing a full-face dragon. Mouth carved with a key-fret border and foot with a band of clouds between two bands of lotus petals. On the base is a ring of key-fret enclosing two characters <i>tian</i> and <i>di</i> (heaven and earth). The same key-fret and characters repeated on base inside, indicating that the splayed foot is a separate piece which has been attached to the vase.\n\nLid carved in the round with Shoulao holding his staff and being offered a peach by a small boy, whilst a lady puts her hand on the boy's shoulder among trees and rockwork. The bottom part with a band of lotus petals and a key-fret border. On the base, the central part of which is slightly raised to fit into the mouth of the base, is a ring of key-fret enclosing the characters <i>tian</i> and <i>di</i>.",
