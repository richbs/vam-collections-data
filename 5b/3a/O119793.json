            "public_access_description": "Cut paper is conventionally associated with the home-made, the cheap and amateur; it is usually small scale, domestic and decorative; it is often adopted to make intimate personal pieces such things as Valentines, or silhouette portraits; traditionally it has been a pastime for women and children, and the medium of such trivial ephemera as greetings cards and Christmas decorations.  Simon Periton has re-invented cut paper work as a dramatic large-scale graphic medium. He tacitly acknowledges and sometimes exploits the antecedents and associations of the process, even as he subverts them. His cut paper pieces are large-scale, often wall-size or even installations. The works themselves explore sophisticated and often complex ideas, using pictorial means, and through the use of pattern, repetition and abstraction. He has described these works - which he refers to as 'doilies' -  as having \"fragile patterns\" into which he can \"entwine sex, death, religion, pop, current affairs, art history - anything\". The process may be inherently simple and low-tech, but Periton achieves extraordinary effects, and much fine detail, and uses layering and colour to create pictorial effects, and also the illusion of volume and recession.\n\nIn 'Lantern 2' Periton represents a feature of domestic architecture - specifically a bay window of the kind typical of British suburban architecture, in particular the commonplace Victorian housing stock. Here the window is represented ambiguously - the central panel could be panes of glass or breeze blocks. The lettering is blurred, crude - a graffiti-style text which echoes 19th century cut-paper work incorporating mottoes and aphorisms. \n\nLike Matisse, who made cut paper collages in his later life, Periton describes his cut paper works as drawings, saying \"Any drawing I might do is done with a scalpel\u2026A pencil line can always be erased but a knife cut has a certainty that appeals to me.\"",
