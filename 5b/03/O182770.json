It also bears strong similarities to the style of helmet called \u2018head-shaped\u2019 (Japanese: Zunari) which is traditionally associated with the close-fitting neckguard (Japanese: Shikoro) in the Hineno style which is fitted to this helmet. This style of helmet became popular in the late sixteenth century and variations were made right up until the end of samurai rule in 1867.\n\nThe neckguard is made from five horizontal lacquered strips (lames) all of which are coated with black lacquer and are laced vertically with off-white silk braid; the upper four lames are made from leather, the lowest of iron. The upper lame is fixed to the helmet with gilt rivets and attached to the front of each side of this lame is a small curved protective device (Japanese: Fukigaeshi). The neckguard is flexible and allows the warrior to raise his arms when using a sword or bow without losing any neck protection. The front of the helmet has a fitting for a fore-crest (Japanese: Maedate) and two fittings for side-crests. (Japanese: Wakidate).  The underside of the visor peak (Japanese: Mabesashi) is coated with red lacquer which would have cast its hue on the face of the wearer making him look more ferocious.",
