It represents an early stage in Sony's development of miniaturised audio equipment, following the production of the first pocket radio in 1957.\n\nThis simple design was very popular - Sony produced almost half a million sets in four different colours. Its slim, tapered shape fits comfortably into the hand, and the volume and tuning dials are both on the same side, allowing the radio to be easily operated with the thumb. The handle pivots, and can be folded away underneath the radio to minimise its size, or used as a stand for hands-free listening.",
