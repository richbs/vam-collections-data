The architectural painter and lithographer Samuel Rayner, who painted this example, specialised in such scenes.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThis room is decorated and furnished in the style set by the court of the Emperor Napoleon III in the 1840s.This style dominated luxury decoration and furnishing in Europe and America in the 1850s and remained popular until the end of the 19th century. The air of rich comfort and relative informality, however, is entirely mid-19th century and can be found in other living rooms of the period. The influential writer and artist William Morris (1834-1896) and other design reformers particularly loathed this style, but its admirers nevertheless remained in the majority.",
