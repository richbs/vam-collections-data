In particular, the hanger, which now links the two parts of the clasp, would originally have been inserted into the length of the belt, at the right side.  These hangers were a common element of women\u2019s marriage belts in northern and central Europe, where they acted as a kind of chatelaine for keys or knives, and continued in use with traditional costume until well into the 19th century.  The closed top of the hanger is also more common in Scandinavia and the Netherlands than in the German-language area, where hangers usually had an open top.",
