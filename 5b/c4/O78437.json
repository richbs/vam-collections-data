The butler laid out the appropriate glasses in front of each guest, and the decanters (vessels for serving wine or port), on coasters, were then placed before the host to be passed around in an informal and relaxed atmosphere. Coasters also served to catch drips that might stain the table. Later versions sometimes had wheels.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThis coaster was made in Sheffield plate, decorated with piercing and a pearled edge.  Sheffield plate was discovered around 1742 by Thomas Boulsover (1704-1788),  a Sheffield cutler.  Boulsover discovered that, when fused together in unequal amounts, copper and silver expanded  at the same rate.  The introduction of Sheffield plate revolutionised the plating industry for it offered an effective, relatively cheap, supremely versatile and durable plating technique which could convincingly imitate the surface appearance of solid silver.",
