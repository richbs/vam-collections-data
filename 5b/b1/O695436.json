            "public_access_description": "This portrait by Richard Dighton is of the tailor and art collector John Jones. John Jones was born in Middlesex in about 1798 or 1799. Following an apprenticeship, he set up in business in London as a tailor and army clothier at 6 Waterloo Place and later on Regent Street. He retired in 1850, at which point he began to amass his collection of eighteenth century continental - mostly French - decorative arts. By the time of his death the collection comprised 1034 objects - paintings, portrait miniatures, porcelain, bronze and ormulo objects, furniture, sculptures and prints - and around 780 books. He displayed this at his home at No. 95 Piccadilly. When he died in 1882 he left his collection to the South Kensington Museum as the V&amp;A was then called.\n\nRichard Dighton(1795-1880) is known for his portraits of prominent men of fashionin London, Cheltenham and Worcester. This portrait is typical of his work in being full-length profile and set against a blank background with just a shadow and small patch of ground below. Richard Dighton began his career as a caricaturist following in the footsteps of his father Robert Dighton (1752-1814). Richard made around ten or twelve caricatures a year between 1817 and 1824 of prominent Londoners including merchants, politicians, aristocrats, lawyers and bankers. From 1824 he began to turn more to portrait painting in watercolours and after 1835 also produced lithographs.",
