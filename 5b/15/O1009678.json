            "public_access_description": "The altar was designed for the Church of St. Andrew, Wells Street, Marylebone. Built between 1845 and 1847, St. Andrew's became a centre of Ritualism and was a model for the Cambridge Camden Society. Its strong Anglo-Catholic credentials no doubt explain the commissions to Pugin for an alter table, the stained glass for the east window c.1848  and possibly the original font. \n\nThe altar was executed with some alterations from the design. It has eight carved wooden legs and painted panels in the front and at the sides. Although possibly executed by Crace, the design is in many ways reminiscent of Pugin's own work. For example the side panels, which do not appear in Pugin's design, are closely based on plate 52 of Pugin's Glossary of Ecclesiastical Ornament, 1844.\n\nAugustus Welby Northmore Pugin (1812-52) is widely considered as one of the most significant and influential architects, designers and theorists of the 19th century. Following his conversion to Catholicism in 1835, he identified the Gothic style with Christian architecture and his work and writings inspired and framed the Gothic Revival. In 'Contrasts', published in 1836, he condemned classical forms and ardently praised 14th and 15th-century architecture. Pugin is best remembered for his work on the Palace of Westminster.",
