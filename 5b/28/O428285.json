The subject appears in a number of her works, often with symbolic images of power such as planes and cars which are also found here. As in many of her works, Singh uses a child-like style to portray Ayesha, inserting her figure on a flat green background (garden). Above, framing the head of the woman, are six older women dancing in an implied semi-circle. To enhance the topsy-turvy nature of the scene, Singh depicts a little bird upside down pecking at Ayesha's ear (left) and on her right, a little tree.\n\nArpita Singh was born in 1937 in West Bengal. Singh trained at the School of Art, Delhi and the Delhi Polytechnic 1954-59. Since the beginning of her career Arpita has been assiduously learning the craft of painting in rhythm with her absorption of modernist reductionism. Her naive paintings are unlaboured and particularly piquant in their comments on the 'space' of women and the girl child in society, as well as the atrophied sensibilities of modern man vis-a-vis the growing domestic violence and social injustice. Arpita literally builds up the painted surface with both oil and watercolour. The surface tension created by the short, overlapping patches of pigments and tones is often transmitted to the surreal surprise which arise out of the synchronicity of domestic objects, flowers and guns, soldiers and blood.",
