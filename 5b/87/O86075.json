Compare however the carving in similar style in the Freer Gallery (16.159), tested by radio-carbon dating to 320+/-90 years before the present. W.T. Chase, 'Examination of art objects in the Freer Gallery laboratory'. <u>Arts Orientalis</u> IX, 1973. pp. 79-88, p. 81, pl. 6.\n\nOpinion of Wu T'ung (Boston) 15/6/1989: Sculpted 3.0 qualities like Yuan. Natural handling of drapery folds, facial quality strong, not like sweet Ming. Floral decoration on robes like that on textiles excavated from a tomb at Huangshan, Fujian, Pei Jia, Hua Hang. 13th century Song-Yuan.",
