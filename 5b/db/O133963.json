Derrick Harris was one of the most distinctive British wood engravers of the mid- 20th century. A pupil of John Farleigh (1900-1965), a leading 20th century wood engraver and artist, Harris went on to develop his own inimitable style, characterized by great vitality, good humour, and frequently an element of slapstick comedy, reminiscent of the Chapbook illustrations that he admired. Harris worked as a freelance illustrator over a range of formats - book and magazine illustration and commercial graphics (advertisements, calendars, Christmas cards, etc.). This print shows an artist engaging enthusiastically and successfully with the medium of wood engraving at a time when it was otherwise at a rather low ebb.",
