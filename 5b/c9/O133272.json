Over the shoulders and down the neck opening are bands embroidered with highly coloured stylized floweres; the neck is edged with a frill of white cut-work.  From the elbow, the sleeves are heavily decorated: first a band of silver metal braid, followed by a woven band of brightly coloured flowers and foliage on a black ground, edged with tiny floral sprays; beneath this is a wide embroidered band of stylized flowers in Hungarian folk style, with huge flower heads - bright orange, purple, red, shocking pink and maroon - with multicoloured centres, above which is a row of smaller flowers and foliate in blues, reds, pinks and yellow; at the base is a row of smaller alternating yellow and orange flower heads.  The edge of the sleeve is a deep band of filet crochet, alternating deep rose red and off white panels overstitched with clusters of rose red, blue green, orange yellow, deep blue, pale sage and white, with bands of the same colours separating each panel.  The sleeve finishes in a row of triangular 'pineapple' motifs repeating the colours of the clusters.\n[Theatre costume] Sleeveless, low-necked sheepskin waistcoat, the coat turned inside (much worn) and the white outer leather covered with traditional Hungarian folk patterns of stylized flowers and foliage in bright red, dull dark blue, green orange wools, with some appliqued stylized flowers in subtle tones of dull blue and brown lilac leather; down the front are a row of tiny leather 'buttons' set on tiny brown lilac bases.  The lower back sides are pleated and overlaid on the visible side with darkest blue leather tongues trimmed with interlaced tiny leather strips ending in triangular 'tails' held by tiny 'rosettes'; the interior of the pleats are appliqued with bright brown lilac leather ovals; fixed above the pleats at waist level are multicoloured wool rosettes from which hang pierced leather triangles in brown lilac leather. The waistcoat fastens on the right with padded circular buttons, the top button retaining traced of a multicoloured bobble which was fixed to the centre; on the left are plaited loops fixed to rosettes of brown lilac leather overlaid with a rosette of white leather held by green thread, centered with a central tiny leather study on brown lilac base;\n[Theatre costume] Hugely voluminous breeches in white cotton, gathered into the waist with two drawstrings, the enormously wide legs trimmed with a white cotton fringe.\n[Theatre costume] Black satin panel, heavily embroidered all over (except for band at top and bottom) with stylized flowers and bands in traditional Hungarian folk style, in bright yellow, off white, green, deep pinks and deep reds, interspersed with dark and light blues and reddish lilac.  At the bottom is a long fringe in brilliant magenta silk.  At the bottom is an embroidered line of stylised flowers, matching rows on  the main panel.",

It is also possible that he wore the costume at fancy dress balls, which were a feature of social life in the 1920s and 1930s.  \n\nThe colour and floral motifs, executed in embroidery on the blouse and appliqu\u00e9 on the waistcoat, mirror the different ways in which effects can be achieved, something which is relevant to stage costume where the execution of a design can be achieved in several different ways to give the correct effect on stage.  \n\nOliver Messel (1904-1978) was Britain's leading theatre designer from the early 1930s to the mid 1950s, working in every aspect of entertainment - ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue - as well as in interior decoration and textile design.  His lavish, painterly and romantic designs informed by period styles, were perfectly in tune with his times and earned him an international reputation.  By 1960, however, Messel's style had become unfashionable, having no sympathy with the new 'kitchen sink' school of theatre.  He increasingly concentrated on his non-theatrical painting and designing and eventually retired to the Caribbean, where he began a new career designing and building highly idiosyncratic luxury villas.",
