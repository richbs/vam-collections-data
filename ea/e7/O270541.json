Motivated in part by the commercial success of several European artist workshops such as the Weiner Werkst\u00e4tte, Fry brought together a group of artists to design furniture, pottery, glass, textiles and entire schemes of interior decoration. Believed to have been printed in France by Besseli\u00e8vre, Omega textiles, which included hand painted batiks, machine printed linens and hand-tufted rugs were progressive in style, mirroring contemporary aesthetic preoccupations within the fields of painting and sculpture. \n\nDrawing upon his fine-art background, Fry believed that Omega's textile designs should err on the side of spontaneity, reflecting an expressive quality that only the artist's hand could invoke. One of just six printed linens produced by Omega, Amenophis is likely to have been designed by the founder, Roger Fry, as it appears to be based on his oil painting, Still Life with Jugs and Eggs (1911-12).",
