The letter warns him that if audiences continue to sing the revolutionary song 'Ca Ira' before performances at the King's Theatre, Haymarket (where he and his company had taken up temporary residence) then the theatre will be shut up.\n\nSheridan, was known for his 'Whig' sympathies and during this period the Tory government was alarmed by the threat of Jacobin activity in Britain. Seditious clubs were proliferating, and there was domestic unrest, including bread riots.\n\n\u00c7a ira, R\u00e9veil du people (which translates roughly as We're off and Away) was a revoluntionary song which had become popular during the revolution in France (ca.1790). \u00c7a ira was  an anglicised version of this song popularised by British radicals, and, like the original, promoted the idea of the masses triumphing over the ancien r\u00e9gime.",
