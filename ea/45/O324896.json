            "public_access_description": "In Louis XIV's France candlesticks with more than one socket were restricted to royal use. Baluster candlesticks were initially made in silver in forms developed by Louis XIV's court designer, Jean Berain, 'dessinateur de la Chambre et du Cabinet du Roi' whose designs for candlesticks were published in 1711. Louis XIV's order to melt down domestic silver to finance the French military campaigns in 1689 and again in 1709 encouraged the production of domestic metalware in bronze which was gilded to imitate precious metal. Ormolu became a favourite material in France for domestic lighting. Jean Berain's designs were widely used by European craftsmen working in  a range of metals, ormolu, pewter, and silver, and promoted the development of the 'Regence' style decorated with bell flowers, strapwork and lambrequins. The circular base, fluted baluster and nozzle with central rib are all adapted from Berain's published designs. These candlesticks are assembled from cast parts using techniques practised by silversmiths in a pattern that dates from the early 18th century, but continued in production in the reign of Louis XIV's successor Louis XV.\n\nThe orange-coloured gilding indicates that the candlesticks were regilded later in the 19th century, but the chasing and burnishing of the cast ornament is of high quality.",
