Efficient mass-production using advanced mould techniques affected quality but increased availability of elaborate vesels to many levels of Chim\u00fa society.\n\nA monkey, bird or other at the shoulder of the spout is characteristic of Chim\u00fa stirrup-spout vessels. The Chim\u00fa worshipped the moon and the press-moulded designs on the vessel body depict a moon deity.",
