The Ajanta cave paintings are the oldest surviving examples of painting in India. They date from the 1st century BC to about AD 480 and depict stories from the lives of the Buddha (the Jatakas). This one depicts scenes from the Janaka Jataka and the Sankhapala Jataka.\n\nThe cave complex was discovered in 1819 and attempts were made to document the paintings inside them. In 1844 Major Robert Gill was commissioned to make copies. Most of the 30 or so paintings he completed were displayed at the Crystal Palace in Sydenham, south London. Unfortunately they were destroyed in a fire there in 1866. This painting is one of only four surviving examples in the V&A.",

The main part of this painting depicts scenes from the Janaka jataka. The narrative continues onto painting IS.53-1885.\n\nNarrative:\nKing Janaka of Videha is seen sitting in his palace with his wife. He announces to her that he intends to renounce his worldly life. Scene depicted in the centre of IS.55-1885.\n\nIn order to persuade him against this course she organises a music and dance performance. Scene depicted in left hand side of  IS.53-1885. \n\nDespite the pleasure of viewing the dancers, the king confirms his decision to live alone. According to Schlingloff, he is persuaded to do this by the sight of women  preparing cotton as the two bangles that one of them is wearing  clash together and resound, whereas the single bangle of the other women remains silent.  Scene depicted in bottom centre of IS.55-1885.\n\nThe king renounces his kingdom and rides out through the city gates on his elephant, accompanied by a retinue which includes his son. Scene depicted in the centre of IS.53-1885.\n\nOnce they have left the city the king and his retinue visit a hermit in the mountains and listen to his sermons. Here the hermit reassures him that only a life of solitude can lead to salvation. Scene depicted in the top right hand corner of IS.53-1885\n\n\nIn the top left hand corner is a scene from the Sankhapala jataka. \nA Bodhisattva, having witnessed the splendour of the Naga king wished to be reborn into the Naga kingdom. In his next birth he was born as the Naga king Sankhapala. He soon grew weary of the good life and as a penance for his desires he lay on an ant hill and offered his body to passers by. \n\nA party of men found him, they tied a rope around him and as they dragged him along Sanhkapala did not resist. A kind-hearted cattle dealer who saw what was happening and offered the men some of his cows in exchange for the serpent. Scene depicted in top left hand corner. The grateful Sankhapala took the cattle dealer to his splendid palace under the lotus-lake where he stayed for a year after which he decided to become an ascetic.",

They depict scenes from the lives of the Buddha and date from the 1st century BC to about AD 480. The cave complex was discovered in 1819 and since then attempts have been made to document the paintings inside them. In 1844 Major Robert Gill was commissioned to make copies. Of the 30 or so paintings he completed most  were displayed at the Crystal Palace in Sydenham. Unfortunately those that were displayed were destroyed in a fire there in 1866. This painting is one of only 4 surviving examples in the museum collection.",
