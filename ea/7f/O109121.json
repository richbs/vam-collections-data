Although incomplete, it demonstrates a dazzling range of ornament, including strapwork (interlaced bands), masks, winged cherubs, birds and dolphins. Profuse surface decoration was fashionable throughout Europe at the time, but it was particularly well suited to the fertile imaginations of Spanish goldsmiths.\n\nThe unknown goldsmith has used a variety of techniques, including embossing (hammering the metal into relief) and casting (creating solid elements by pouring molten silver into moulds). The urn-shaped section of the stem and the dolphin brackets below it have been cast from moulds and their details probably refined by chasing (fine hammering from the front using steel chasing tools).",

Money and labour were lavished on religious art and images played a central role in daily worship. To ensure that goldsmiths focused on work for the crown and the church, the authorities brought in a series of sumptuary laws that limited the secular display of gems and precious metals. \n\nBy 1550 the silver mines in Peru and Mexico were generating enormous wealth for Spain and feeding the traditional taste for massive silver forms. They included the custodia, a towering architectural canopy that was unique to Spain. It was paraded through parishes during the Corpus Christi festival to display the Sacred Host (consecrated bread). The custodia embodied many characteristics of Spanish church plate. It was sculptural, highly visible and richly imaginative in design. \n\nWith the Counter Reformation, Spain became a triumphant defender of a revitalised Catholic faith. Silver altar vessels and entire altars, processional crosses, custodias and sanctuary lamps frequently appeared in goldsmiths' contracts.",
