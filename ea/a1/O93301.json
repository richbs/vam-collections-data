From the right, Maya's right arm appears in the fragment, grasping the branch of a sala tree.   Five bracelets adorn her wrist.  From under her elbow, the head of the Buddha, now destroyed, emerged surrounded with a tiny nimbus.  To the left the head of Indra in profile gazes at the child.  He wears an elaborate turban with a cockade on top, a circular earring and a drooping moustache. A nimbus with an incised margin is carved behind his head.   Behind Indra, on a higher level the head and upper torso of a turbaned figure appears with his index and the little finger of his left hand into his mouth, in a gesture of amazement. His right arm was formerly raised, but is now destroyed, and held the end of his <i>uttariya</i> which he waves energetically above his head. In the extreme upper left hand corner there is a drum.\n      The fragment is carved in high relief, and the rear has lines of broad horizontal chisel marks which bear traces of beige-coloured mortar.  The top side of the panel shows the schist is stained with a reddish colour, suggesting that there are veins of iron running through it.",
