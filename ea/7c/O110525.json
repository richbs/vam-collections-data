The combination of industrial materials and geometrical figures was popular in 1920s decorative arts and fashion accessories. These streamlined handbags complemented the boyish and svelte silhouettes of the 1920s flappers and were necessary accessories for the new flat style of dresses without pockets. The minimalist handbags were big enough to carry a cigarette case and a lipstick, but slender enough to be carried under the arm.",
