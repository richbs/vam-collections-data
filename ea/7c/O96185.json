            "public_access_description": "Habich was the first to attribute this work to Weiditz, and his opinion is generally accepted. Like other pieces linked to Weiditz, it depicts the sitter facing the viewer but looking slightly to the side. Also typical of Weiditz are the small triangles serving as stops between some of the words in the inscription, and the simple but naturalistic portrayal of costume, including the detailing of the feather and the linen shirt. Habich also calls attention to a painting of Rehle in the Dresden gallery, dated 1524, by Hans Maler of Ulm (active 1510 - 29), which depicts the sitter without a beard, posed differently, and wearing different clothes, yet with features that appear to be those of the man present in the portrait. Interestingly, the painting is inscribed with a legend of the sort more commonly found on medals. Rehle's date of birth is clear from the inscriptions on this medal and the information given on the painting. His death date is unknown. Little is known of his life, although Habich records that he belonged to a family that was originally from N\u00f6rdlingen and speculates that he night have conducted business in Augsburg and outside of Germany as well. Weidtz, who is known to have journeyed to Spain and probably Italy, could have executed Rehle's portrait while both he and his subject were abroad. There is also a miniature of Rehle in the Kupferstichkabinet in Berlin. \n\nDomanig noted that there is a poor bronze cast of this work in the M\u00fcnzkabinett in Vienna, so it is apparent that it was indeed intended as the model for a medal.",
