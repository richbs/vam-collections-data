The outer fabric is of flattened buff silk that has a stencilled floral pattern applied with a blue paint. The paint can be seen to bleed at some points and is rubbing off. There is one stone? bead remaining on the head band. It is brown in colour. The fabric has also been embossed to form diamond patterns across the skull cap and rings around the head band. The lining is of finely woven blue silk. The skull cap and head band are lined separately and the stitching, in running stitch, goes in rings around the inside, approx. 15mm apart. In between the layers is padding of undyed wool and a layer of paper.  Half the head band is missing.",

The cap is made of a stiffened skull cap attached to a stiffened, wide head band (95mm wide). The outer fabric is of flattened buff silk that has a stencilled floral pattern applied with a blue paint. The paint can be seen to bleed at some points and is rubbing off. There is one stone? bead remaining on the head band. It is brown in colour. The fabric has also been embossed to form diamond patterns across the skull cap and rings around the head band. The lining is of finely woven blue silk. The skull cap and head band are lined separately and the stitching, in running stitch, goes in rings around the inside, approx. 15mm apart. In between the layers is padding of undyed wool and a layer of paper.  Half the head band is missing.",
