The other two, with their identical dimensions and similar scenes presumably must come from the same set. \nEnamelling was traditionally one of the skills of the goldsmith and in Augsburg it continued to be demanded of aspirant goldsmithing, as opposed to silver-smithing, masters.  So far no object with Priester\u2019s maker\u2019s mark has been found, and two of the pieces bearing his signature have the makrs of other goldsmiths, so he probably specialised solely in enamelling.\nAcquisition RF: 96867/1898",
