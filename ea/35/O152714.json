            "public_access_description": "This is one of a set of seven lithographs by different artists, published by Motif Editions in connection with Cybernetic Serendipity, a major exhibition held at London's Institute of Contemporary Arts in 1968. The portfolio includes two works by the Computer Technique Group, plus single works by Charles Csuri and James Shaffer, William Fetter, Maughan S. Mason, Donald K. Robbins, and Kerry Strand. The complete set was acquired by the Museum in 1969, at a cost of \u00a35. \n\nCsuri's image of iconic American toy soldiers is based on a larger artwork that also included a computer-generated list of soldiers' names.  At random, the program decided who would be killed, wounded, missing or commended in battle. The original work was produced in 1967, when anti-Vietnam war sentiment was at its height.\n\nThis copy of Random War was donated to the Museum by the Computer Arts Society. Some of the society's founding members had been involved in the Cybernetic Serendipity exhibition.",
