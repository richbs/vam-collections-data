It was intended for the music room of Dr Friedrich Victor Spitzer's town house in Vienna. Spitzer was a wealthy patron of the arts. \n\nThe shape of the chair appears to have been very popular at the time as at least two similar versions are known, one by Adolf Loos and another designed by Josef Niedermoser, whose firm made this chair. \n\nThis particular chair was made for the actress Maria W\u00f6lzl's apartment in Vienna, very shortly after the design was first produced for Dr. Spitzer.",
