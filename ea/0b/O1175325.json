The hand-dyed and stitched layers of gauze evoke the 'make do and mend' initiatives designed to prolong the use of domestic textiles, in this instance the practice of turning sheets.  The imprint of the body is reproduced on the quilt in red silk thread, the densely stitched areas exploring the connection between both body and memory evoked by fabric.  \n\nBorn in Britain and now resident in Fremantle, Australia, Whiteley has experimented with worn and stained bed sheets, tea towels, nappies and bandages that have a strong connection with the domestic environment but also the body.  She reflects on the personal reassurance provided by everyday textiles as arbiters of highly personal messages - in this case the hardship shared by many in post war Britain.",
