            "public_access_description": "This print is part of plate 53 taken from Voyage dans la Basse et la Haute Egypte published in 1802. It features an engraving of a temple to the Goddess Isis called Contra Latopolis, so-called because it stood opposite the temple of Latopolis (Esne). \n\nThe engraving by Jean Baptiste R\u00e9ville (1767-1825) is based on sketches made by the artist and diplomat Dominique Vivant, Baron de Denon (1747-1825) when he travelled with Napoleon\u2019s army in Egypt in 1798 to record the archaeological features of Egypt. Two of Denon\u2019s pen and ink studies of this temple are in the British Museum, dated 1802.\n\nWhen General-in-chief Napolean Bonaparte (1769-1821) set off for a campaign in Egypt, he took more than 150 engineers, scientists, cartographers, surveyors, architects, linguists, forming a Commission des Sciences et Arts d\u2019\u00c9gypte, to record and study Egypt\u2019s topography, plant and animal life, minerals, and industry. While Napoleon campaigned in Lower Egypt, Denon accompanied General Louis Desaix (1768-1800) through Upper Egypt in a campaign against the Mamluk leader Murad Bey. Denon's sketches of Luxor, Karnac, Dendera, Thebes, Esna, Edfu, and Philae promted Napoleon to instruct two teams of people to complete the project. The result of their work was eventually published in the Description de l\u2018Egypte (1809-28). Meanwhile Denon also used his illustrations in his earlier book Voyage dans la Basse et la Haute Egypte, published in 1802.\n\nDenon\u2019s artwork and the resulting publications sparked a renewal of interest in the Egyptian arts and Egyptian motifs featured in French architecture and the decorative arts. Prints from Denon\u2019s volume, including this one, were reproduced on a S\u00e8vres porcelain dinner service designed in 1805 and called the Service Egyptien. Two dinner services were made, one presented to the Tsar Alexander of Russia in 1808 and the other ordered by Empress Jos\u00e9phine in 1810 but later presented to Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington. A possible trial plate with this image of Contra Latopolis is in the British Museum.",
