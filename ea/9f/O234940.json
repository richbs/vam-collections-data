            "public_access_description": "The design of flower-filled urns in a basket is in classic Nabeshima style of the sort found on high quality Nabeshima porcelains manufactured in the early eighteenth century under the  patronage of the Nabeshima clan, the family of feudal lords who controlled the area in which the Arita porcelain kilns were located. This is also true of the stylised camelllia devices on the dish's underside and the combed pattern on the high footring. The use of spur marks is not, however, found, on true Nabeshima wares, which are also usually characterised by the application of enamel colours within outlines painted in underglaze blue (doucai) - a feature not found on this dish. These suggest that the dish is a late eighteenth or early nineteenth century product made at a commercial kiln in the Arita area for a market in search of affordable reworkings of a famous ceramic style.\n\nIrene Finch commentary:\nDish with Classical Nabeshima comb foot, in Post-Classical / Late Classical Nabeshima style with decorated narrow flat rim and painting style no longer doucai, but more 'free'. A spur mark shows it to be Arita, a fake copy 18th-19th century. The design is a basket with two crackled urns, a begonia flower and an unknown flowering branch. [Hirado make the most common fakes, in the rigid Classical style, but with the typical Hirado non-green glaze]",

In 2003 a similar sherd was accepted by the Nabeshima Research Soc. as Nabeshima (Seminar notes Feb 2003, Kyushu, p.111 top, no spur mark visible), as were several sherds related to a different example (Finch 91/31, number 41 on this list).
