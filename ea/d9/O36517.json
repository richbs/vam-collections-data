            "physical_description": "The whole consists of a truck cab, trailer and aircraft. Each piece is made of wood, painted with green lines to represent camouphlage. Some metal parts are used on each piece. \n1. cab; with small open box trailer. It is flat fronted with a separate radiator grill nailed on; the grill is marked with lines with an oval at the top centre marked LEYLAND. The cab roof is metal, nailed on and painted green; it is suppored at the centre front by a bar of metal, bolted with a nut and screw to a spur of wood. Side windows are cut away from the wood. An open box trailer is screwed and nailed on; from the back board is attached a metal chain with a spike and to the underside\na double V shaped bracket with holes drilled through to take the spike when the main trailer is linked up. The cab is mounted on a pair of wooden wheels at the front attached to a metal and wood housing with a bracket between to allow the wheels to turn from side to side. At the back is another pair of wheels, carved to represent pairs of wheels. These are also on a metal and wood mounting block and covered with metal `mudguards'. The mountings, mud guards and back wheel hubs are painted green. Ht.8in x w.6 x l.10\u00bcin \n2. trailer or low loader; flat wood; rounded at the front and partly painted. It is mounted on a pair of wheels at the front; each carved to represent a pair; and a double pair at the back similarly carved. The front wheel mounting of wood and metal is a complete swivel joint with a metal tube coupled to the front; this has a hole and forms the link to the cab. The back wheels are covered with `mudguards'. The mountings and most of the wheels are painted green. On the top surface is attached with a screw and nut a wooden block shaped into a large V. This block\nsecures the aircraft to the trailer. Ht.4in x w.4\u00bcin x gt.l.16in \n3. aircraft; representing a fighter plane such as a Spitfire or Hurricane. \n\n(The donor saw these planes during the 2nd War World). The body is turned and shaped wood with a metal nose to which the propeller would be attached; it was made of aluminium and\nwould spin but has been missing for many years. On the top is attached another block of wood representing the cockpit. The wings are attached to a metal brace\nunder the body while the tail wing is slotted into a groove cut into the end of the body. The tail fin; also attached to a groove cut into the end of the body is a\nreplacement and not painted. Also attached the metal brace is the mounting for the two wooden wheels. The bar between the wheels fits into the block attached\nto the trailer. There is a small rear wheel attached to the underside of the body by a swivel metal mounting. The whole has been painted a cream with green\nstripes; except for the replacement tail fin. On the top and under sides of each wing and along the sides of the body are the remains of paper RAF insignis (red;\nwhite and blue circles). l.13\u00bcin x w.16in x gt. ht 5in. The surface paint has crazed and wing tips are scruffed but otherwise it is in very good condition.",
