Agnew, November 1942. The costume is characterised by the strange fashion of a woman's wearing a man's high cravat. This feature is also to be seen in a drawing reproduced from the collection of Mr. L. G. Duke as 'Mr. Hobson of Markfield and Family' in L. ed. S., Pl. 14. It appears from sketch-books and sketches in the Louvre (R.F.1870: 08700, 06078, 06085) that Constable was drawing the Hobson family in 1806. It, as the owner believed, the drawing represents John Harden and his family, this would equally point to a date of 1806. No. 64 in any case belongs to the period when Constable was very active in portraiture, from 1803 onwards, and is probably to be dated not far from the middle of the decade. There are many portrait sketches of a similar type in the British Museum.'\n<u>Victoria and Albert Museum, Department of Engraving, Illustration and Design and Department of Paintings, Accessions 1942</u>, London: HMSO, 1955.\nThe full text of the record is as follows:\n<b>\nCONSTABLE, John, R.A.
