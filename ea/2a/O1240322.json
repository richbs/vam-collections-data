His photographs highlight the enduring human spirit, often addressing difficult issues in a subtle way.\n\nIn 'Rister Mkansi in the family kitchen 3', from the series 'Child-headed Households' (2007), he captures the reality of a family formed of sibling communities who are left to fare for themselves.  The photograph powerfully acknowledges the blight of AIDS without depicting it directly.  We are invited to investigate the detail of the domestic interior - the symbols of the children's day-to-day reality.",
