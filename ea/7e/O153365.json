This piece, however, was made for local use, probably at the court of Golconda or one of the other Deccani sultanates. Fabrics such as this could have been used for garments or furnishings, and a large section of a floorspread survives (in the Philadelphia Museum of Art) which uses this fabric as its outer border. The Philadelphia piece is significant because it bears ink stock-taking inscriptions on its reverse which state that the floorspread was in use by 1689, and this date can be used as a guide to dating this fragment too from that period .",
