By cutting, fretting, bending and polishing, a single sheet of silver has been given life and form.  The handle arches up into the grasp, the tail flicked down to act as a support, but also as a focus of energy.  The piercing creates both lightness and a sense of movement.  This fish appears as slippery as its real life inspiration.",
