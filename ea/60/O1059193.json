Full Citation:\n\n\u201c<b>128 Called Richard Price</b> \n<b>1670-3</b> \nP107-1910 \n\n<b>Oval 70 x 58mm</b> \n\nFeatures in brown and sanguine with some black, with blue-grey and blue for the shadows, and yellow with white heightening, on a very pale carnation ground; hair in brown wash, hatched and touched with darker, colour especially in the curls, and with touches of pale gouache heightening; cravat in pale grey, modelled with darker colour and white; mantle in brown with gold mixed into the pigment and heightened further with gold; robe in blue, modelled with black and pale grey; background to the left a dense, dark brown wash, and to the right a landscape and sky in opaque blue, grey, white, green and ochre; on vellum put down on modern card (see Condition). \n\n<b>Condition:</b> Almost certainly relaid on to pasteboard from the original table-book leaf; a zinc-white retouch on the nose and other small damages; otherwise apparently good. \n\n<b>Signed:</b> Not signed. \n\n<b>Frame:</b> Seventeenth-century gold locket, the convex back and deeply grooved sides flaring out to the bezel, which holds the shallowly convex glass by its bevelled edge; the hanger of tear-drop form made from wire of squared section, channelled down the middle, bifurcating into a double loop down the back of the locket and rising as a flat ribbon to form two diminishing spirals of six turns. A nineteenth-century engraved inscription on the back: <i>Richard Price Esq.</i> \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> George Salting, (1) acquired by him from an unrecorded source, and by him bequeathed to the Museum, 1910. \n\n<b>Literature:</b> <i>Salting Collection</i>, 1911, p. 46 (as part of the group of Salting's Flatmans, though this was left out of the new arrangement of the Collection which this publication accompanied); Foster 1914-16, vol. II, p. 112 (presumably included under no. 56, 'undescribed', Salting Collection); Long 1929, p. 155; Long 1930, p. 28; <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 21. \n\nAlthough unsigned, the miniature is unmistakably by Flatman, and Long had no doubt about labelling it as such when it joined the rest of the Salting Collection on displayc.1913.The identity of Richard Price is unknown. Robert Price (1655-1731), subsequently a judge, would surely be too young to qualify as a possible sitter for this image of the early 1670s. The suggestion was made by Richard Price Esq. in June 1971 that he may have been of Farranfad and Greencastle, County Down. Unless this Richard Price had some intellectual or social connection with the Flatman circle, however, he seems a remote possibility. \n\nTechnically the miniature is much more elaborate than is usual for Flatman, even though the flesh-painting has the 'scratchy' graphic frankness that increases in Flatman's work of the 1670s, going significantly beyond the wiriness of the 1660s. \n\nThe basic decision to portray the subject in formal costume - the wig and the glimpses of robes suggest academic, professional or Court dress of the late 1670s coupled with the lavish archaising use of metallic gold in the painting perhaps suggest that the sitter was of exceptional status, exceptional in youth at least, as compared with the legal <i>eminenti</i> identified in Cat. Nos 119 and 129. \n\n1 Salting Collection, no. 4622. \n2 Correspondence in department files.\u201d",
