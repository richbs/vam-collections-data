The two parts are linked by a straight metal bar.  The engine moves on four wheels, two of which are linked to the mechanism.  There are two trip hooks underneath which would stop and start the engine, possibly reverse, at appropriate places on the track.  The wagon is on four plastic wheels and it has a trip bar wich forces up to levers in the body with the action to unload goods.\n2.  track, in three sections linked by metal plates.  The two outer sections are single lengths of track and the central section is a double cross over band of track.  It is blue with yellow, red, green, black and white markings to show track, green verges and stones.  Toward the end of both single tracks there are two holes into which something fited, possibly a station or buffers.  Each has a directional arrow.  The central piece on both tracks has cut and raised pieces.  These connect with the trips under the engine and that under the wagon.  One on each track stops the engine and the other pushes the lever trip under the wagon.  There are also guide mouldings in the track to keep the train in line.\n3.  track, in two sections, blue and red with green, yellow, black and white markings to show tracks and grass verges.  At one end there is a station and buffer and the station has a similar trip lever on its side to that of the wagon and there are trip hooks on the track at both ends.  The track is double with cross over areas at the centre and the two parts are held together by a metal plate.\n*IT MAY BE THAT ONE OR OTHER OF THESE TRACKS DO NOT BELONG, HOWEVER, THE TRAIN SEEMS TO WORK ON BOTH OF THEM.\n\n*This is a toy copied from the Russian designs.",
