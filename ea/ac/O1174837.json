They are often hand written, although printed set lists are becoming more common. They become treasured souvenirs of specific shows for fans, who often grab them off the stage after the performance, or request one from a roadie. \n\nMarina and the Diamonds is the stage name of singer songwriter Marina Diamandis (\"the Diamonds\" does not refer to a backing band, but as she puts it on her MySpace page, her fans). Her musical style ranges from keyboard-based ballads to more up-tempo new wave-style songs with full band backing. She cites her influences as ranging from Daniel Johnston to PJ Harvey to Britney Spears. Diamandis has also been noted for her sartorial choices, which she has described in magazines as \"vintage, cheerleader and cartoon\".",
