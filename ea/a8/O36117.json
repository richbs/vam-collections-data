It is in a baulking stance with the legs firmly at an angle and attached to the base. The whole is cast in two halves along the length and held by tongue and slot joints. The ears are black rubber and placed in holes in the head. The clown is lithographed in paler shades; white; pink; blue and green and is attached to the donkey's back by a rod though the feet. The whole is mounted on a red metal base which is flat at the top with semicircular sides and two large metal wheels with red rubber tyres. At the back is a small balance wheel and there should be a similar one at the front; it is missing. The clockwork mechanism drives the large wheels and the whole should tip back and forth from small wheel to small wheel. The clown then moves up and down on the back of the donkey.",
