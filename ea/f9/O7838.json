The great hall was the usual setting for such displays, since it was here that the medieval lord feasted with his household and guests. These eye-catching decorations not only advertised his wealth, but also proclaimed his lineage and social alliances.\n\nPlace\nThis is one of a series of coats of arms relating the history of the Beaupr\u00e9 family. It is thought to have been commissioned by Sir Robert Bell for Beaupr\u00e9 Hall, the family's ancestral home near Wisbech, Cambridgeshire. Bell married Dorothy, the sole heiress of the Beaupr\u00e9 line, in 1559 and succeeded to the Beaupr\u00e9 estate following the death of Dorothy's father, Edmund, in 1567. The windows seem to date from the completion of a new great hall in around 1570, but were later moved and cut down to fit narrower lights.\n\nPeople\nThis shield shows the arms of William Coggeshall. An heiress of his family must have married into that of Fordringaye, as the four shell-shaped escallops of the former's arms can also be seen incorporated in the coat of arms of Thomas Fordringaye (see another panel from this group, museum no. C.65-1946).",
