This piece, like much of his work, was inspired by the pure forms of Swedish plates and beakers made in the period 1500-1600.\n\nHaglund was one of the most important Swedish silversmiths of the second half of the 20th century. He trained in Sweden with master silversmiths in K\u00f6ping and Kristianstad and in the Atelier Borgila. This was the workshop of Erik Fleming, the leading Swedish silversmith of the 1920s and 1930s. Haglund has been one of the major figures and influences in post-war Swedish silversmithing, which in turn has had an enormous international impact.",
