The fabric of the undercoat is a variation of the pattern worn by his wife. The delicate whorls on the buttons are meant to indicate that they are made of metal.\nIn his own day Ridolfo Sirigatti (active ca. 1570-1600) seems to have been regarded as a sculptor of considerable eminence. The son of a rich textile merchant and of Cassandra, daughter of the painter Ridolfo Ghirlandaio, Ridolfo continued his father's mercantile activity and brought fame to his family by becoming one of the Knights of Santo Stefano (the order instituted by Grand-Duke Cosimo I de' Medici) in 1581.\nThis bust is a rare example of Ridolfo Sirigatti's activity as a sculptor. Together with its companion piece, depicting Cassandra Sirigatti (A.13-1961), it shows high technical skill and an unusual and original style in comparison with Florentine contemporary sculpture. The peculiar disposition of the shoulders in both busts, with the right one pulled slightly back from the rest of the figure, and the left pushed slightly forward, shows the artist's intention to give an impression of movement.",

Together with its companion piece, depicting Cassandra Sirigatti (A.13-1961), it shows high technical skill and an unusual and original style in comparison with Florentine contemporary sculpture. The peculiar disposition of the shoulders in both busts, with the right one pulled slightly back from the rest of the figure, and the left pushed slightly forward, shows the artist's intention to give an impression of movement. The technical virtuosity, visible especially in the draping of the fabric, foreshadows the taste of seventeenth century Roman sculpture. It is possible to identify some elements that would appear in the sculptures by Pietro Bernini, who received his first artistic training from Rodolfo Sirigatti. \n\nIt is exceptional in structure, the sitter's right shoulder is retracted and his left shoulder is advanced, while his head is turned slightly to his left, so that the bust has the spiral character of Giambologna's marble groups.",

Before the discovery of the present bust and its pendant in 1961, his only documented work was a bust of grand-duke Francesco I in a niche in the fa\u00e7ade of the Palazzo dei Cavalieri di Santo Stefano in Pisa (Sirigatti only provided the model for the bust). Ridolfo features as one of the four protagonists in Raffaele Borghini's art treatise Il Riposo (1584), as an art expert and collector. In the dialogue between Sirigatti and the collector Bernardo Vecchietti some works by the former are mentioned. Amongst them is the \"marble head of his father done from like which is extremely alike\", which can be identified with the present bust.  \nIt is inscribed with the sitter's name and the date on the socle (NICOLAVS SIRIGATTIVS MDLXXVI). On the back there is another inscription, a dedication presenting the bust as a tribute from Sirigatti to his father: QVEM GENVI RODVLPHVS ANIMI CAVSA CAELAVIT (Ridolfo, whom I bore, sculpted this as a tribute of love).",
