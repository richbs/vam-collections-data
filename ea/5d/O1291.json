These shorter glasses - made in only two parts, the stem being drawn from the bottom of the bowl - were more stable, their rather plain forms being enhanced with cut flutes or facets. Not only were they elegant, but they perfectly complemented contemporary decanters, which followed exactly the same form but upside-down. Such skilled wheel-engraving in the fashionable Neo-classical taste was probably added by specialist glass dealers who had their own cutting shops - mainly in London. Engraved decoration could double the cost of a glass.",
