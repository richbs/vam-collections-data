Kenneth Tyler, Master Printer at Gemini G.E.L., described the process:  \"The very precise line drawings of Albers dictated the use of mechanical means to  assimilate his drawings into embossings.   Investigations led to a system of programmed tape  engraving.  Collaboration between the artist, myself  and an engineering programmer established the exact  profiles for each line and the proper thickness of  paper.  The engineering programmer translated the  original artist's drawing to a digital mylar tape.  The tape then directed an automatic engraving mill, with  specially designed cutting heads which cut into the  printing plates the mirror image of the original  drawings.  Embossing ...was executed in a hydraulic  forming machine.  The use of heat and excessive  pressure secured the image permanently into the  mould-made paper fibres.\"",
