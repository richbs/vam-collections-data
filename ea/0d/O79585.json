Gower House was begun around 1765, and the chimney-piece dates from a few years after this time. It was removed when Gower House was demolished in 1886 by Charles Robert Carrington, 3rd Baron (from 1895, 1st Earl) Carrington (1843-1928).\n\nPeople\nSir William Chambers was one of the chief exponents of English Palladianism, and along with Robert Adam (1728-1792), one of the most important British architects of the second half of the 18th century. He was born in Sweden, and travelled to the Far East in his youth. He studied extensively in France and Italy. In 1756, soon after his return to London from the Continent, he was appointed architecture tutor to the Prince of Wales, later George III. In 1761 he became joint architect (with Robert Adam) to the Office of Works. He was a founder member and first Treasurer of the Royal Academy of Arts.\n\nProvenance\nThe chimney-piece remained in Gower House after its installation in about 1775 until the house was destroyed in 1886. About ten years later it was taken to Daws Hill, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire. Daws Hill was acquired by Wycombe Abbey School in 1929, which sold the chimney-piece at auction in 1995. The V&A purchased it three years later.",
