In the bottom right corner an elderly man, sitting under a shelter and bearing a crutch, holds up a lantern to St Christopher and the Christ Child as the former carries him through a body of water with fish swimming around him. In the background is a mountainous landscape with a castle and a town nestled in a valley along the river bank.\nThe roundel is surrounded by a border consisting of two intertwined stems with flowers, fruit and foliage, divided into four segments by logenze-shaped devices in small compartments. The painting is in dark brown and silver-yellow, the design being partly executed by the use of the point.",

            "public_access_description": "The history of St Christopher has been passed down to us from a variety of sources written later than when the events of his life are believed to have occured. It is believed that Christopher, born as 'Offerus' in the early 3rd century, was the son of a pagan king and a Christian mother. They lived in Canaan (some accounts say Arabia). Offerus was said to have been a giant in stature when he reached manhood. He set off into the world determined to serve only the bravest and strongest leader. He served various rulers, all pagan, who did not match his expectations. On his travels, he came across a hermit, by name Babylas, who encouraged him to serve Christ. Offerus consented to act as carrier of Christian pilgrims across the water as there was no bridge and no boat for them to use. One day, a small child asked to be carried across. As Offerus carried him, the child grew heavier and heavier. When they reached the other side, the child informed Offerus that he had been carrying the weight of the world and He who had created it. Offerus realised that Christ was the strong, brave ruler he had sought to serve and asked the hermit, Babylas, to baptise him. Babylas gave him the name 'Christopher', meaning 'Christ bearer'.\nSt Christopher was martyred in the middle of the 3rd century. His early cult is unknown but there are depictions of him at Mt Sinai and he was worshipped in France, as early as the 6th century. His association with protecting travellers stems from his legend. In the medieval period, images of St Christopher were very often found painted on the north wall of small churches, opposite the south door entrance. This was because of the belief that viewing his image would protect you from sudden illness or death for the rest of the day. Church visitation accounts from the later Middle Ages often negatively refer to this superstitious belief.\nThis roundel shows Christopher wading across the water with fish swimming around him. The Christ Child is on his shoulders and be bears an orb, representing the world. The man in the bottom right holding a lantern is Babylas the hermit. The V&A Museum possesses another roundel (Museum no. 946-1900) which probably formed part of the same series of roundels, depicting various saints. The other depicts St Andrew. The style of painting and the dark black pigment in these roundels is indicative of a North German stained glass workshop although we cannot rule out a Flemish origin.",
