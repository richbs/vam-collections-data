With its authentic page layout, order form (to purchase copies of the 'catalog' rather than the clothes), and postal frank it almost convinces as the real thing. \n\nThe pseudo fashion photographs are given an array of treatments. In some cases the clothes dissolve into the background, or are replaced with more 'interesting' content, in others it is the models themselves who disappear into the surrounding backdrop. Elsewhere, models' silhouettes are obliterated to become semi-abstract compositions. Many of the resultant images have a flippant or mocking tone, revealing the artist's irreverent attitude to the fashion industry.",
