            "bibliography": "G. Reynolds, <i>Victoria and Albert Museum: Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, 1973, pp. 41-44\nThe following is an extract from the text of the entry:\n\n'Page from a sketch book.\n\nNote on Nos. 21-32:\n\nThe twelve leaves of Whatman paper Nos. 21-32 come from the same sketch book. Leslie (L. ed. S., p. 16) gives the following description of its contents: \"In the year 1801, it appears by one of his sketch books, he visited Derbyshire. The sketches he made there, like those at Helmingham, are slight and general. They are washed in one tint only, and with no attempt at the beautiful finish or force of chiaroscuro seen in his later studies\". The hinge marks are not always apparent, having in some cases been trimmed away, but the general coincidence of style, medium, subject-matter and size justifies the linking of the undated drawings (Nos 28-32) with the visit to the Peak District and Derbyshire. The height of the untrimmed pages of the sketchbook tapers from about 175mm. (hinge side) to 170 mm.\nThe dated drawings give the following itinerary: 4 Aug. Matlock; 12 Aug. Mam Tor and the Dove near Buxton; 17 Aug. Chatsworth Park and Haddon Hall; 18 Aug. Edensor. The entry in Farington's <i>Diary</i> for 19 August 1801 (Greig, Vol. I, p. 312) shows that Constable was still in Dovedale on that day: \"At 9 o'clock we entered <i>Dovedale, I made a sketch of the first appearance of the entrance</i>, and while I was so employed <i> Mr Constable</i> came up to me, He having come a 2d time to make studies here. He was accompanied by a Mr Whaley who lives near Newcastle in Staffordshire\". (Mr. Whalley was a member of the family into which Constable's sister Martha had married.)\nTwo sketches in the collection of Dr. H. A. C. Gregory (sold at Messrs. Sotheby's, 20 July 1949), which appear from their measurements to have come from the same sketchbook, are thus described in the sale catalogue (entries slightly abbreviated):\n\"Lot 63. A view of Derwent Dale, inscribed <i>Derwent Dale Aug 8</i>; pen and sepia wash, 6 1/2 x 10 in.\"\n\"Lot 64. A view near Derwent Dale; sepia wash, 6 1/2 x 10 1/16 ins.\"\nA drawing made on the same tour, but not from the sketchbook, was Lot 65 at the same sale: \"A view of Baslow, inscribed <i>Baslow Augt. 14 1801</i>; pencil heightened with white on blue paper, 10 3/8 x 13 5/8 ins.\"\nMr. Iolo Williams has pointed out the strong resemblance between the style of these drawings and those of Sir George Beaumont (<i>The Times</i>, 1 May 1953). Farington's <i>Diary</i> for 1800 and 1801 records, largely in unpublished extracts, many visits paid by Constable to Sir George Beaumont to study his collections, to copy pictures, and for encouragement. Farington's entry for 13 July 1801 describing the painting 'Old Hall, East Bergholt' shows that he was aware of the resemblance in style at this stage: \"Constable called on me & I on him to see a picture, a view of Mr. Reads house near Dedham. It is painted on coloured ground which He has preserved through the blue of his sky as well as the clouds. - His manner of painting the trees is so like Sir George Beaumont's that they might be taken for his\" (Greig, Vol. I, p. 309).\n\nG Reynolds",
