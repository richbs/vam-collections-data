After a diploma in drawing and painting from the Government College of Art and Architecture, Hydrabad in 1963, he studied mural painting and printmaking at M.S. University, Baroda (1963-65).\n\nGoud's rural upbringing provides the inspiration for his work. Unlike typical representations of village life, he does not present an idyllic and romanticised image. His intimate knowledge and understanding of rural life allows him to depict his subjects in a truthful and sometimes humorous way. He sees the village as a very open society, where man and nature interact dynamically. In this contemporary etching Goud portrays five village woman standing and talking in a group besides a goat. A sixth woman depicted next to a tree stands on the right hand side of the image reinforcing a close relationship between villagers, animals and the landscape.",

Unlike typical representations of village life, he does not present an idyllic and romanticised image. His intimate knowledge and understanding of rural life allows him to depict his subjects in a truthful and sometimes humorous way. He sees the village as a very open society, where man and nature interact dynamically. Thus his prints portray the close relationship of villagers with the animals and landscape, capturing their vitality and lust for life.",
