The print testifies to the popularity of national dances in the Romantic Ballet period.  \nThe right-hand figure is obviously a female dancer performing en travesti, and so may date from the late Romantic Ballet period in France.  The focus on the female dancer during the Romantic period led to the sidelining of the male dancer and his eventual replacement by a  shapely female dancer performing en travesti.  The practice continued into the 20th century in England and France, although not in Russia and Denmark, and it was the first performances by Les Ballets Russes in Paris in 1909 that helped restore the male dancer to his rightful place on the ballet stages of Europe.",
