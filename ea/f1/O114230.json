The gesso was tinted violet to co-ordinate with the decorative scheme of the room in which this formed part of the panelling.  The neo-classical candelabrum ornament, named for its upright branching shape, is typical of fashionable taste in France in the 1780s and relates to the carving found on contemporary beds and chairs, particularly in its combination of naturalistic motifs such as birds and flowers with an urn and a lyre.   The panel was used by George Basevi (1794-1845) as a model for the mural decoration in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge which he undertook between 1836 and 1845.",
