She probably held a rudder (symbolic of her role as the divinity who guided and conducted the affairs of the world) in her other hand, now missing. The figure was probably made in the Eastern Roman Empire, in the 1st or 2nd centuries of the Christian Era, and was probably one of a pair, each worn suspended from an earring. Its form and function recall Ancient Greek models. Although rings, bracelets, necklaces and brooches were worn by wealthy Romans, they were less inclined than their Greek predecessors to display their status by way of gold jewellery, as such ostentation went against contemporary notions of virtue and decorum.",

Her other hand, now broken away, almost certainly held a rudder, symbolic of her role as the divinity who guided and conducted the affairs of the world. A complete figure of similar size, carrying a horn of plenty and a rudder, is in the British Museum's collections of Antique Jewellery, where it is identified as Roman and dated from between the 2nd century BCE and the end of the 4th century CE. (See Marshall, <u>Catalogue of the Jewellery</u>, no.3014 and plate LXIX.)\nThe figure was probably one of a pair, each originally attached to an earring. Surviving examples of Ancient Greek jewellery include similar cast figures dangling from disc-shaped earrings (see for example the images in Wolf Rudolph, ed., <u>A Golden Legacy</u>, 28.B.1-2 (pp.132-3); I am grateful to Martin Henig for his suggestion, in correspondance, that this figure was originally attached to an earring).\nBy the time this pendant was made, Rome had already been established as the dominant military and political force across the Mediterranean for two centuries. Some Greek goldsmiths had moved to Rome, but most jewellery that circulated in the Roman Empire continued to be made locally, in different regions. Greek motifs, therefore, continued to circulate. Although rings, bracelets, necklaces and brooches were worn by wealthy Romans, they were less inclined than their Greek predecessors to display their status by way of gold jewellery, as such ostentation went against contemporary notions of virtue and decorum.",
