The son of a clock-maker, he finished Russian circus school in Moscow in 1949 and started his career on the Moscow Circus of Tsvetno Boulevard.  Six years later, he became the first clown from the USSR to perform in the Western world.\n\nIn 1969 Popov was honoured with the title of the 'People's Artist of the USSR'. A star performer with the Moscow State Circus, he performed as clown, a mime, a tightrope walker, and a juggler. In 1981 he won the Oscar of the clown world: The Golden Clown of Monte Carlo. His role as a clown follows the tradition of the Russian 'Ivanushka', who fools other people and who is teased himself. Later he toured worldwide as The Sunny Clown and in 2006, when performing at the 30th anniversary of the International Festival of the Circus of Monte-Carlo, he received a royal standing ovation.",
