It contained the ashes of a member of an aristocratic family, and was constructed of six pieces of a grey slate. The outer vertical faces are incised with images of the Four Guardian Animals: the Dark Tortoise of the North, the Vermilion Bird of the South, the Blue Dragon of the Left, the White Tiger of the Right.  The inner walls are incised with lotus and peony flowers. Apparently the chest was excavated in north Korea, near present-day Song-do, near Kaes\u00f4ng, the former capital of Kory\u00f4.\n\nColour: Grey\n\nThis small slate chest is decorated with elegant peony patterns on its inside and with the four guardian deities on its outside, which are the blue dragon, white tiger, red phoenix, and black tortoise. In particular, the blue dragon and white tiger are dynamically portrayed both running towards the black tortoise. After the military coup in 1170 during the Goryeo Dynasty, it was widely popular among Royals and aristocrats to cremate the body of the deceased in a temple and bury the ashes in a slate chest. With the lid now missing, this slate chest consists of five well-refined slate panels: the bottom slate and the four side-slates have grooves along their edges for slotting all the panels into a stable chest.",
