This new science enabled the first drawings of the arrangement of atoms within molecules. It was particularly developed as one of the most significant and exciting branches of science during the late 1940s and put Britain at the cutting edge of international research. In 1946 Dr Helen Megaw, a Crystallographer (Crystallography \u2013 a study of the structure of matter) suggested that the patterns made by X-ray crystallography could be used as a fresh source of inspiration for wallpaper and fabric designers. The patterns were considered particularly appropriate for use in textile design because of their repetitive symmetry and natural beauty.\n\nThis sample pattern is based on Insulin. It is one of a group of nitrocellulose-coated upholstery and wall covering fabric samples (Mural Rexine and Vynides) made for the 1951 Festival of Britain. The creation of patterns inspired by science was perfect for the theme of the festival, which had been planned as a \u2018combined exhibition of science, technology and industrial design\u2019. This new product range, developed by ICI\u2019s Leathercloth Division (Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd.) was intended for heavy duty use in schools, restaurants and cinemas. Strong, coated cloths, Rexines and Vynides were usually in the form of imitation leather.",

Photographs were then taken of the diffracted X-rays, and the resulting lines or spots were used to plot 'maps' indicating the relationships between atoms. For the first time ever it enabled scientist to work out the structure of atoms within molecules. Britain was a world leader in the field of crystallography and during the post war period this was one of the most significant and stimulating branches of science.",
