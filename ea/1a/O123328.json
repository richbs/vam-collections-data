In the south, Christian symbols such as the cross and rosary were widely worn as jewellery.  The crosses worn with traditional costume often followed out-dated aristocratic examples.  Many were based on 17th and 18th century patterns, but over time local differences became fixed, and patterns became characteristic of a particular place.  \n\nThis pendant comes from the Abruzzi.  It is 18th century in design, but the detail is typical of 19th century traditional jewellery.  Its original owner would have worn it on a ribbon, strung through the two vertical loops on the back of the bow at the top, and tied at the back of her neck.  \n\nIt was bought as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867, where it was described as forming part of the traditional bridal gifts.",
