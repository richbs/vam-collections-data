Lagaan means land tax, and the villagers are unable to pay this to their British rulers because there has been no rain and no harvest for three years. The British officer challenges them to a cricket match, a game which the villagers are unfamiliar with, and if they win the tax will be abolished, if they loose it will be tripled.",
