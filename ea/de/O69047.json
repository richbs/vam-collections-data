Chocolate first reached Britain in the 1650s and was marketed as a luxury product. European ceramic and silver manufacturers were quick to start designing utensils for this new beverage, and sometimes included silver cups in toilet sets. Elegant lidded chocolate cups, such as this one, often came in pairs and would have been used by fashionable men and women.\n\nChocolate is made from the pod of the cacao tree which is native to central America. The tree was transplanted to West Africa and the New World colonies by transatlantic traders where it was cultivated using slave labour. The arrival of chocolate, and other exotic substances in Britain, represented the third and final leg of the \"Triangular Trade.\"  The trade triangle was a three legged network where manufactured European goods were traded for people on the west coast of Africa. These people would then be shipped across the Atlantic to work in British New World colonies as slaves producing raw materials that would then travel back across the Atlantic to Britain.",
