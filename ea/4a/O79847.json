Most European cultures disapproved of male jewellery, but buttons allowed men to show off their wealth and status.  In the Balkans, most buttons were made of metal thread in the Ottoman tradition.  Silver buttons were mainly found in the west along the Adriatic coast of Dalmatia, and in Albania and northern Greece.  They were made as toggle buttons, with a link and bar for fastening, and were used on men\u2019s waistcoats or jackets.  Only in a few isolated places were silver buttons included as part of women\u2019s costume.\n\nThese impressive buttons are probably men\u2019s buttons from this region.  The majority of Balkan silver buttons are made of filigree, are oval or cylindrical in shape, and are rather smaller than these.  But the twisted wire link and flat bar are typical of Balkan buttons, and it is difficult to say where else they might have been worn.  They were said by the donor to have been acquired in Athens.",
