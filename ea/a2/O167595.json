(London, 1922), fig. 37, p.26\nVictor Chinnery, 'Clopton, Woodbridge, Suffolk', Antique Collecting, September 1976, pp.\nIvychurch Priory (n6) was a 12th century foundation of the Augustinian Canons, dissolved early in 1536 and pulled down in 1888. \"a crude piece, the product of a carpenter rather than a joiner, but its importance lies in the fact that genuine furniture of such an early date is extremely rare. the construction is simple, consisting of quarter-sawn oak planks, pinned together with oak pegs, and pierced with traceried openings. The low form of the cupboard is difficult to account for without presuming some alteration, and it is probable that we have here the upper part of an originally taller cupboard. Herbert Cescinsky did not think it had been cut down, but I can see no such alternative (Cescinsky and Gribble: Early English Furniture and woodwork, vol. II, p.26). The lower portion must have been sawn off, perhaps because of damage by damp or pests. The original height was about 3' 10\", with the usual shaped feet raising it from the floor (cf. Percy Macquoid: The age of oak, figs. 2 & 3).\nDictionary of English Furniture (Country Life 1924-7, 2nd rev. ed. 1954), Percy Macquoid and Ralph Edwards (1924-7), Cupboards, Food p. 185 fig. 4\n\"formed of planks pegged together and finished near the edges by a rude channel moulding...\"\nCharles H. Hayward, Antique or Fake? (New York, 1981), p.111\nCharles Tracy, English Medieval Furniture and Woodwork (London, 1988), cat. 315\n\"A strong caveat should be entered with regard to the authenticity of this piece. It can be compared to the livery cupboard at St Donat's Castle, Glamorgan (Roe 1902, 101) or the cupboards formerly belonging to Morgan Williams (Macquoid 1904, figs. 2&3). The absence of original door hinges and feet leaves little by which to judge the object's genuineness.\"\nFred Roe, A History of Oak Furniture (London, 1920), plate XIX\nThomas W.Bagshawe, 'Open Cupboards', in Apollo April 1937, pp. 205-209",
