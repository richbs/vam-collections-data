            "physical_description": "The perambulator is made of wood, supported on a wood and metal frame and four wheels.  The body is shaped with rounded ends, painted red, decorated with a single black line and a white floral design on each side.  The seat is padded red American oilcloth and the well and foot area are covered with cream paper printed with a brown pattern (it is most probably wallpaper).  Above the seat is a `surrey' top of wood, covered on the underside with printed paper and on the upper side the black American oilcloth; around the edge is the remains of a silk fringe. The top is mounted on decorative cast iron arms, hinged at the middle to allow the top to be above the seat or folded down behind the seat.  The handle and arms are of polished wood.  The wheels are hoops of steam pressed wood each with eight spokes.  the rear wheels are larger than the front ones.  Each wheel hub is covered by a metal disc; the front ones are decorative and the rear ones are plain.  The whole is constructed with screws of various sizes.\n\n*Although there are no markings, the pram looks very similar to toys made in the north eastern area of the United States during the 1830 to 1880 period.  The use of oilcloth and the flat surrey hood also strongly indicate an American product.",
