The series shows ladies's dresses designed by six leading Parisian couturiers of the time - Jeanne Paquin, Ernest Raudnitz, Madeleine Laferri\u00e8re, Gustav Beer, Jacques Doucet and the House of Rouff. Each lithograph is printed with its designer's facsimile signature.\n\nThis design is for a day dress designed by Jacques Doucet (1853-1929) for the House of Doucet. After inheriting a lace and lingerie establishment in Paris, Doucet opened his couture house in the early 1870s. He became known for his meticulously made, exquisitely embellished evening dresses, impeccably tailored suits and luxurious outerwear. The House of Doucet merged with Doeuillet in 1924. Doeuillet-Doucet eventually closed in the early 1930s.",
