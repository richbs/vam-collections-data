Numerous inscriptions relate to the setting up of the loom and eventual weaving of the textile. Surviving evidence points to this design having been prepared specifically for Stephen Wilson of the firm of Lea, Wilson & Co, weavers of handkerchiefs and shawls, based in Spitalfields, London. Evidence given to Parliamentary committees set up in the early 19th century to discuss the textile trade suggests that Stephen Wilson was the first to introduce the jacquard loom into the British Isles. \n\nEarly use of the loom concentrated on dress accessories (handkerchiefs, shawls and ribbons), as the initial high costs were acceptable for these luxury items. In 1818 Wilson himself mentioned the jacquard by name, although there is no suggestion that he had used it at this stage.  In 1821 he gave evidence suggesting that the space and height needed for the jacquard would mean that it would have limited use.  By this time, however, he himself had already sent an industrial spy to France to investigate its use and had taken out a patent on a French loom, which he was adapting for use.",
