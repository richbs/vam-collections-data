Several wallpapers were produced in the same muted mauves, purples, pinks and browns that were typical of the fashions. The designs were heavily influenced by Art Nouveau styles and patterns. Several of the Biba wallpapers, including this one, were produced as small sheets with integral borders, rather than conventional rolls. They were of a size and paper quality which meant they could also be used as wrapping paper.",
