The figures may plausibly be identified as, on the left, Eve being tempted by the serpent and, on the right, her taking the forbidden fruit. Because of the damage to the column separating the two figures, it is not possible to be conclusive on this point, although the pose of the figure on the left does echo that of Eve on a capital in the Museo di Antichit\u00e0 in Parma. The other scenes on the front would have continued the Genesis story, emphasising how through Baptism the Soul would be absolved from Original Sin.",
