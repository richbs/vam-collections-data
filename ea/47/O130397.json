Curiously enough they do not appear to have been produced before the invention of movable type. None of the existing examples can be dated before about 1460. Being a very laborious method, each letter being cut individually in the wood, only very popular works such as this compendium of the Bible were printed in this way. Few block Books were published after c. 1500\n\nPrintmaking Techniques Gallery in the Henry Cole Wing"

In the centres of the top and bottom registers, four prophets wearing elaborate costumes and head-dresses sit beneath architectural archways (two above and two below). Speech scrolls contain quotations from the prophets. Clockwise from top left they are a passage from Deuteronomy, David, Job and a passage from Kings (Samuel). In the top horizontal compartment the two prophets are flanked either side by text explaining the connection between each of the two outer images and the central image. In the bottom horizontal compartment on either side of prophets are 'tituli', which serve as titles to the three main images. All text is in Latin.",

This aptly prefigured the raising of Lazarus, whom the Lord raised from the dead and restored to his sisters, that is, to Mary Magdalene and Martha\n According to 4 Kings iv 8-37, Eliseus [Elisha] the prophet saw that the son of the widow with whom he used to lodge was dead, and he postrated himself on the boy, and the body of the boy grew warm and came to life. Eliseus prefigures Christ: and indeed the boy whom he raised from the dead represents Lazarus, restored to life before the Jews' eyes\n [two different watermarks in volume: \n\nBulls Head with cross(?- not very clear).

            "public_access_description": "This page shows scenes from the New Testament flanked by parallel scenes from the Old Testament, with quotations at the top and bottom of the page from the Prophets. It comes from a block-book called the 'Biblia Pauperum' (Pauper's Bible). This name has been given to books which tell the story of the redemption of man by Christ, set against prophecies and prefigurations from the Old Testament. \n\nEach page of a block-book, text and images, was carved from a single wood-block. The method was very laborious as the maker carved each line and letter out of the wood, cutting away the background. To make the print, paper was rubbed over the inked block from above. \n\nBlock-books were first made around 1430 and co-existed for decades with books printed with movable type (invented about 1450). This method was economical for very popular works because the block could print large numbers without expensive apparatus such as printing press or type. \n\nBiblia Pauperum is a misleading name because the arrangement of texts explaining the images\u2019 relationship to each other suggests an educated and pious readership. The book may have been intended for the poor clergy or as an aid for personal meditation.\n\nBiblia Pauperum is thought to have been originally composed around the mid-13th century in the region that is now Austria and Southern Germany, evidence suggests, in monastic circles. More than 80 surviving manuscript versions have been identified (some in fragments), dating from around 1300 to the late 15th century.",

Lord Vernon, R.N., Sudbury Hall, Derbyshire.\n\nHistorical significance: A block-book is a book where each page or double page spread, both text and images, is printed entirely from one wood block. The method of preparation of the block was very laborious. The maker had to cut each letter individually in the wood so only very popular works, such as summaries of the Bible, were printed in this way. Nevertheless, blockbooks' production as woodblocks enabled them to be printed in large numbers. The blockbooks were produced ca.1460 probably in Utrecht or Haarlem. Few were published after 1500. Versions were also printed using movable type. The contents derive from manuscript versions, which were popular in the Middle Ages, from late thirteenth century, and possibly even the late twelfth.  \n\n<i>Biblia Pauperum</i> is a name (misnomer accepted since Heinecken first used it in print in 1769) given to books which tell the story of the redemption of man by Christ, set against prophecies and prefigurations from the Old Testament. It is thought to have been originally composed around the mid-13th century in the region that is now Austria and Southern Germany, evidence suggests, in monastic circles. More than 80 surviving manuscript versions have been identified (some in fragments), dating from around 1300 to the late 15th century. \n\nEditions were also printed in blockbooks and moveable type. The blockbook consists of forty full-page illustrations united by an architectural frame. The pages are printed on one side only but these are paired so that they form double page openings. \n\nIn illustrated versions of the <i>Biblia Pauperum</i>, scenes from important events in the New Testament (from the life of Christ or the Second Coming) are set together with four bust-length portraits of prophets and the texts of their prophecies that refer to the main event, as well as two narrative events from the Old Testament that prefigure the main event (except the last page which shows a scene from 'Revelations').  The text on each page consists of internally rhymed captions, called tituli, below the three pictures, the quotations from the four prophets appear as scrolls, and there are also exegeses of the two prefiguring scenes on either side of the central image.\n\n\"Typology is rooted in textuality and the literal meaning of Scripture and thus cannot have been intended for an unlettered audience. Sometimes the reader is required to remember or make reference to the scriptures. Allegory is included in the imagery and even parallel arrangement of people and objects in the images or is spelled out in the exegeses. Most of the tituli tell the story of the types. The exegeses do too, but also tell how the types relate to the antitype.\"\n\n\"It is probably not coincidental that the blockbook versions of the Bibla Pauperum appeared around the same time that numerous treatises on the Art of Memory were also published, whether with woodcuts or movable type. New technologies of communication are often used at first to amplify old patterns of thought. Understood in this way, early print culture and especially blockbook culture initially reinforced the interaction of oral and literate strategies that characterised the later Middle Ages. Thus the blockbook, which, like the printing press, was an innovation in the production of writing, was also a final, complex elaboration of medieval conceptual strategies.\"\n\n\"The manuscript version of the Biblia Pauperum is the earliest illustrated book of typology and in both its manuscript and blockbook forms the book had a profound and enduring effect on the typological tradition. Typology is fundamental to this book. Typology in this context (it is sometimes used more broadly) is a habitual strategy of thought or conceptual composition, which shows how people or events in the Old Testament (called the types) prefigure and are fulfilled by people or events in the Gospels (the antitypes).  Typological prefiguration was closely associated with Christianity from its beginnings, and it greatly proliferated in the twelfth century. Along with typology, the types and antitypes are frequently portrayed with visual analogues; some individual images have allegorical content and the power of symbolic objects appear in several scenes. Thus allegory and symbolism interconnect in this work.\"\n\nall quotations taken from (Nellhaus, Tobin.
