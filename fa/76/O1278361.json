            "public_access_description": "Child actors or 'child prodigies' were all the rage in the early 19th century when 'infant phenomena' appeared all over the country following the most notorious 'Young Roscius' of them all, Master Betty, or William Henry West Betty (1791-1874) who made his first stage appearance   aged eleven at Belfast in 1803. The soubriquet 'Young Roscius' was a reference to the celebrated Roman actor Quintus Roscius Gallus (126-62BC).\n\nThe two performers who starred in this evening's entertainment at the New Theatre Bridgnorth were 'the celebrated Young Roscius' Master William Robert Grossmith and his younger brother Master B. Grossmith. William was born in Reading in 1818, the son of a picture framer, and had made his debut in 1824, aged six, at London's Royal Coburg Theatre. This evening's entertainment in 1831 was part of a tour that included Stafford on 12th December, Lichfield on 14th December, Birmingham on the 19th December, and was clearly intended to prolong the appeal of the elder William Robert by including his five-year old brother in the act.\n\nThis playbill features a number of detailed woodcuts illustrating the many roles that each of the boys performed that evening. The extra expense of producing such a playbill indicates the theatre management's confidence that the evening would warrant such lavishly illustrated publicity, and be a success. Tickets for the evening could be purchased from Gitton the Printer, who was also the proprietor of the Stamp and Post Office, and from Master Grossmith himself. A performer who issued tickets, or orders for a performance, usually took a percentage of the profits from that performance.",
