It is Pugin who suggested the simple quatrefoil flower for the border. This design is referred to in a leter from Mrs Pugin to Crace, dates 11 December 1851 (RIBAL Crace MSS POUG 8/66): 'My husband has made every exertion to get you what you require for the rugs, he has not only got the larger one draw [sic] out, but also other patterns which you can enlarge yourself with the colours marked'. Pugin was unwell and this no doubt explains J.H.Powell's assistance.  It seems likely that many rugs were made to this design, though there may be none now remaining in the Palace of Westminster.",
