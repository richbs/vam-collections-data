            "public_access_description": "Mirka Rozmus is an Australian weaver who specialises in creating unique hand woven silk scarves. Originally trained as a classical violinist, Rozmus ran her own Design Studio in Sydney creating couture garments from her hand woven fabrics. She gave up her musical career in 2002 to concentrate on weaving full time.\n\nRozmus trained under Peter Townley, also a musician, who ran a weaving course at the Tasmanian School of Art, before moving to Sydney in 1984. Every year she travels to Kyoto in Japan to purchase the traditionally hand dyed silks from which she weaves limited edition scarves. She uses the traditional method of handweaving, working on an eight shaft, foot powered jack loom; this is a lengthy and precise method of handweaving as the warp alone may contain over 2,000 fine silk threads. Rozmus weaves only two or three scarves per warp and never reproduces an original design. Each finished scarf is individually named and allocated an 'archival number' before being rolled on a hand made silk covered roller, wrapped in Japanese paper and placed in a box, also designed by Rozmus and hand made in Kyoto.\n\nThe '5 Pillars of Wisdom' series was inspired by a temple dedicated to the God Brahma, Lord of Creation, discovered in the remote jungles of Nepal. In designing this scarf, the first of a series of four, Rozmus has combined the pillars of the temple with writing, recalling the strange and intricate script carved on the massive pillars. She choose a particular colour blue for the weft as she felt it evoked the traditional drawings of the Hindu pantheon, in which the Gods are often depicted as being blue in colour. The '5 Pillars of Wisdom' is the second series in which Rozmus has tried to evoke a sense of mysticism of divine knowledge 'transmitted' through ancient script found on stone pillars.",
