            "public_access_description": "This painting forms part of a series of panels of Old  Testament characters that also include Adam and Eve, Joshua  and the prophets Ezekiel and and Elias. It may originally  have decorated the screen or gallery of a church or  private house. It is typical of the plainer style of church  decoration that prevailed after the Reformation from  about 1540 onwards. The surface was no longer  embellished with rich gilding and intricate two-dimensional  patterns. The purpose of such panels was didactic rather  than devotional. Simple images, large text and the use of  English rather than Latin made the stories accessible to a  wide range of people, many of whom were neither well- educated nor literate.\n\nThe panels almost certainly come from the south-west of  England. The figures are similar to those on a painted  ceiling at Muchelney Abbey and in plasterwork at  Montacute House, both in Somerset. The lettering is  similar to inscriptions on walls of the Dorset churches of   Puddletown and Cerne Abbas. The panels were  purchased in 1914 from a dealer from Lynmouth, Devon,  by the name of T. Charbonnier. There was a strong  tradition in south-western England in the early 17th  century of portraying figures of this kind with associated  texts in plasterwork. This panel, one of a group of 25 in  the V&A, is a rare surviving example of the tradition  executed in paint on panel.\n\nFrom about 1590 stories from the Old Testament supplied  popular decorative themes in domestic and church  settings in the West Country. Examples include Prideaux  Place (1590s -1630s) and Lanydrock (1630s), Cornwall,  and the parish church of Widecombe in the Moor, Devon.",
