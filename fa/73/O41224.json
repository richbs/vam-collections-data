In the same year she received a number of awards including The Photographers Gallery Award, The Sunday Times Award and the John Kobal Portrait Award.   The series she has made for this BMW commission are very different from the urban tableaux that brought her to the attention of art critics.  However, evident throughout her work is the use of a very strong narrative.  In the 'Horsepower' series, she has used digital photography to depict the racing of horses featured in the window of a betting shop.  As the photographer has noted, 'Our bet is on the yellow horse and therefore she represents part of our aspirations.  Ultimately she is first to pass the finishing post.  But as she is jockeyless, the bet is void.'",
