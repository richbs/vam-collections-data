This gives the illusion of a single three-dimensional image when viewed through a stereoscope designed to hold it.\n\nOwnership & Use\nStereographs were mass-produced. Viewing them was a popular amusement carried out in the home from the 1850s until the early 20th century.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe still life is a traditional subject for paintings. It was translated into the new medium of photography as a suitable pictorial subject. Here the various art objects include statuettes, a painting and some stereographs. A hand-held stereoscope, designed for viewing stereographs, is visible in the group to the left of the angel statuette.",
