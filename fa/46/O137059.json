            "public_access_description": "Phyllis Ginger studied at the Richmond School of Art between 1932 and 1935. Although her main ambition was to become an illustrator, she was encouraged during her studies to also follow her interests in etching and portraiture. She exhibited for the first time at the Royal Academy in 1938 and was elected to the Royal Watercolour society in 1952. In 1939 Phyllis Ginger was involved in the Pilgrim Trust scheme 'Recording Britain', which employed artists to depict topographical views of buildings and other characteristic sites perceived to be at risk of destruction by enemy action.\n\nThe sheet shows a sketch a group of figures. The grouping of the figures is similar to that in E.314-2007 and E.316-2007, suggesting that it may have been made at the same time. The outline of each figure has first been drawn in pen before the artist has added watercolour to bring depth to the figures in the composition. The dress of this group of figures suggests that the work is from the late 1940s. This can be seen particularly in the long grey coat, reaching below the knees of the lady with her back to us wearing a black and red hat. This reflects the artist's work as an illustrator for fashion magazines such as 'Harpers Bazaar' in the 1940s.",
