Known for his intense live performances with The Stooges, he produced two albums with the band before splitting them up. After meeting with David Bowie in 1971, Bowie persuaded Pop to get the band back together to record the landmark album Raw Power. Instrumental in the rise of Punk, the band split again in 1976, and Pop began recording with Bowie in Berlin, working on 1977's The Idiot and Lust For Life. Although these two albums are not really representative of his output, using electronic effects and with an introspective atmosphere, they are his two most acclaimed solo albums, which informed the 1977 tour that this t-shirt was worn on.",
