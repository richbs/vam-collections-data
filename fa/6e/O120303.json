The French connoisseur Edmond Joly de Bammeville declared that the \u2018daytime\u2019 bracelet was the \u2018main feature of national dress\u2019 in England. Up to seven or eight of differing design might be worn between the wrist and elbow on both arms. Alternatively, they could be worn in pairs and even over gloves. \n\nDistinctions of rank, age, occasion and dress determined what jewellery could be worn and when. One etiquette manual stated that diamonds, pearls and emeralds were for full evening wear only. In the daytime, women were expected to wear less elaborate jewellery.",
