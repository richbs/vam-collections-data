Chagall was a prolific painter as well as a printmaker and produced, among other things, series of book illustrations, including etchings for the Bible. He also produced a number of self-portraits, and some of his best known paintings include images of himself. This self-portrait communicates the sense of humour and lightness of touch that Chagall injected into his work, as he grins at the viewer like a lost Marx brother. \n\nChagall was born in Russia and worked there in the early years of his career. He spent most of his career in France, first in Paris and later in his life in the South of France, but also spent time in Berlin and during the Second World War he lived in New York. His immigrant Jewish identity informed his work, as he mixed a variety of influences to create a surreal, colourful visual world.",
