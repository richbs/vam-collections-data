Blue felt shoes are attached to the end of each leg, the right shoe has the beige Norah Wellings label attached to the bottom.

She later  went independent and set up her own toy factory in Shropshire in 1926, Victoria Toy Works. Norah Wellings continued to make dolls until 1960, whilst also designing dolls for Chad Valley. Her dolls are unusual in that they are made of velvet / felt or velveteen. Most dolls had sideways glancing eyes as a sort of trademark. All of her dolls have a Norah Wellings label sewn onto them saying 'Made in England by Norah Wellings', these can usually be found on the foot.\n\nNorah Wellings produced many ethnic dolls which were sold on sailing ships as gifts. Her most famous dolls are her South-Sea Islander dolls. She also produced dolls during the Second World war which represented the Army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force. Harry the Hawk was a mascot doll produced to raise funds for men serving in the Royal Air Force. This particular doll is one of her ethnic collection, complete with Norah Wellings cloth label on the foot.",
