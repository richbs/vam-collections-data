This example demonstrates the successful combination of exotic but minimal cobalt-blue painting and a severely practical form.\n\nMaterials & Making\nMany manufacturers of creamware (a type of glazed earthenware made by combining white-firing clays and calcined flint) switched to making a new whitened body with blue-stained glaze sometime around 1775.  The appearance of the new earthenwares was made bluish deliberately, partly because the public had tired of the yellowish creamware, and partly because there was an established taste for the rather grey colour of blue-and-white English and Chinese porcelain. The Staffordshire potter Josiah Wedgwood (1730-1795) named his version 'Pearl White', while other manufacturers referred to it as 'China Glaze'.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe manufacture of Pearlware included, of necessity, the adoption of a style of cobalt-blue decoration that suited the glaze colour. Early Pearlwares, like this plate, show clear influences from English porcelain (notably Worcester), imported Chinese porcelain and from delftwares (tin-glazed earthenware), which were then rapidly going out of fashion. Sparse Chinoiserie patterns of this kind could well have been painted by former delftware decorators, whose factories had been unable to adapt to making creamware or Pearlware.",
