Sadler experimented with transfer-printing on white glazed delftware tiles, transferring images from engraved copper plates to tiles, using enamel colours fixed in low-temperature firing.\n\nActors and actresses could become big stars in the18th century, when theatres, concert halls and pleasure gardens were the major forms of public entertainment.  Engravers regularly produced images of paintings of the most popular performers, so the ability to reproduce engravings on ceramics was a lucrative development.  Since the engravings were transfer-printed, the original images appear on the tiles in reverse.\n\nElizabeth Younge was born in London and first appeared on the stage at Drury Lane Theatre in 1768 as Imogen in Cymbeline.  She went on to become a favourite at Drury Lane Theatre where Garrick emploed her and she established herself as a leading actress in both comic and tragic roles. She left Drury Lane after the 1778-1779 season after a difference over her salary and joined the Covent Garden company.  She married the young actor Alexander Pope in 1785 and acted with him in the provinces and in London.",
