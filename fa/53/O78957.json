Changes in fashion have meant that few houses now have such paintings visible,  though there are undoubtedly more to be discovered under layers of paint or newer panelling.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nOrpheus, in Greek mythology, was the son of the god Apollo. He was able to charm the wild beasts with his music and by its magic power even move trees and rocks. This story was a favourite theme for poets, painters, printmakers and musicians in the 17th century. For example, the first successful opera, performed in Mantua in 1607, was Monteverdi's Orfeo.  The anonymous artist here has copied closely his composition from a print in a natural history book, the frontispiece to A Book of Beasts, published anonymously in 1630 by Thomas Johnson. Book illustrations and other prints were frequently used as image sources for embroidery and tapestry weaving, which decorated rooms and furniture.\n\nText\nThe inscription reads:\n\nSuch Heavenly power in musick rests\nIt calmes and tames the savage beasts\nWhilst Orpheus playes\nEach beast obeyes.",
