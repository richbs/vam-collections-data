Vol 2: Essex, Suffolk, Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire, Northhamptonshire and Rutlandshire, Norfolk, Yorkshire. Introduction to Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire, p.91.\n'Cambridgeshire, like Berkshire, is long and sprawling; its southern border marches with the almost metropolitan Hertfordshire, while at the other end it merges into far-away Lincolnshire.  It is nearly sixty miles in length, yet it possesses only one important centre, and that a University city.  Its large rural areas - not dictated to, not dragooned, not exploited - have retained such varying characteristics as are apt to be found in so long a span.  The recording of Cambridgeshire on a limited scale was thus not easy.  It demanded more artists and more time than could be afforded and, to be brief, it was destined from the first to be left in a suspended and introductory condition.  The villages in particular call for endless recording, and since communications, never very good, were in war-time often less than adequate, they  had to remain virtually untouched.'\nPevsner, Nikolaus. <u>The Buildings of England: Cambridgeshire</u>. Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1970. p.243.\n'Opposite Scroope Terrace HOBSON'S CONDUIT has been re-erected.  It originally stood on Market Hill and dates from 1614.  It is a hexagonal structure with shell-topped niches, strapwork ornamentation on the top, and an ogee cupola rising behind this...Hobson's Conduit, or the Cambridge New River, was built from 1610 to 1614 to conduct water to Cambridge from Nine Wells near Trumpington - a parallel to the exactly contemporary New River supplying London with fresh water.  The scheme was financed jointly by the town and the University, and endowments for its upkeep were made by Thomas Hobson, carrier, d.1630-1, and Samuel Potto d.1632.'",

            "history_note": "This work is from the 'Recording Britain' collection of topographical watercolours and drawings made in the early 1940s during the Second World War. In 1940 the Committee for the Employment of Artists in Wartime, part of the Ministry of Labour and National Service, launched a scheme to employ artists to record the home front in Britain, funded by a grant from the Pilgrim Trust. It ran until 1943 and some of the country's finest watercolour painters, such as John Piper, Sir William Russell Flint and Rowland Hilder, were commissioned to make paintings and drawings of buildings, scenes, and places which captured a sense of national identity. Their subjects were typically English: market towns and villages, churches and country estates, rural landscapes and industries, rivers and wild places, monuments and ruins. Northern Ireland was not covered, only four Welsh counties were included, and a separate scheme covered Scotland.\n\nThe scheme was known as 'Recording the changing face of Britain' and was established by Sir Kenneth Clark, then the director of the National Gallery. It ran alongside the official War Artists' Scheme, which he also initiated. Clark was inspired by several motives: at the outbreak of war in 1939, there was a concern to document the British landscape in the face of the imminent threat of bomb damage, invasion, and loss caused by the operations of war. This was allied to an anxiety about changes to the landscape already underway, such as the rapid growth of cities, road building and housing developments, the decline of rural ways of life and industries, and new agricultural practices, which together contributed to the idea of a 'vanishing Britain'. Clark also wanted to help artists, and the traditional forms of British art such as watercolour painting, to survive during the uncertain conditions of wartime. He in turn was inspired by America's Federal Arts Project which was designed to give artists employment during the Great Depression of the 1930s.\n\nOver 1500 works were eventually produced by 97 artists, of whom 63 were specially commissioned. At the time the collection had a propaganda role, intended to boost national morale by celebrating Britain's landscapes and heritage. Three exhibitions were held during the war at the National Gallery, and pictures from the collection were sent on touring exhibitions and to galleries all around the country. After the war, the whole collection was given to the V&A by the Pilgrim Trust in 1949, and it was documented in a four volume catalogue published between 1946 and 1949. For many years the majority of the collection was on loan to councils and record offices in each county, until recalled by the V&A around 1990. The pictures now form a memorial to the war effort, and a unique record of their time.",
