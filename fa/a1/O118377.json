It is an example of the most elaborate textiles made for furnishings at that time. They were used to cover walls (serving the same function as wallpaper today), to upholster furniture, and to make into curtains. Catherine II of Russia acquired this design and used it in these ways in an apartment in one of her palaces; she chose a blue background instead of this red one.  \n\n'The Partridges' and other similar designs particularly impressed Lasalle's contemporaries because the designer and maker managed to achieve the exact representation of nature (flowers and birds) in a woven fabric, the pattern being created during the weaving process not applied afterwards. This was a technically complex process which involved many hours of labour in preparing the design, setting up the loom and weaving the silk. As a result such silks were extremely expensive, and only within the means of the elite.",
