His right leg is raised (in this case supported by a lotus flower) with his weight on his less bent left leg.  He holds a ball of butter in his right hand and the left hand stretches gracefully to his side at shoulder level.  His hair is in a topknot typical of such images and he stands on the usual south Indian lotus above a square tiered plinth, in this case both with incised details.  Although quite a heavy cast the modelling and details are of fair quality.  Copper colour, little wear.",
