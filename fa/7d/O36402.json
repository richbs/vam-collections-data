The right horse is tan with black trim and a jockey painted white; light green and red. The left horse is cream with black trim and a jockey painted red and blue with a light green cap. Both jockeys are looking to the left and the horses are in a galloping stance. They are mounted on metal supports from the clockwork which move up and down in rotation governed by the twists in the wheel axles. The clockwork is housed in a blue metal casing mounted on two large red wheels at the front and a small one at the back. The key is integral to the mechanism. It is the front wheel axles which govern the movement of the horses. \n*Although not marked the celluloid and design bear a strong resemblance to those made in Japan during the 1920s and 1930s. The celluloid is the thin brittle type. \n*see also B140-1994",
