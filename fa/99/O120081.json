            "public_access_description": "This represents the white American vaudeville performer Thomas Dartmouth Rice (1806-1860), as Jim Crow, the character he made famous in 1828 when he introduced it in an intermission of a play called The Rifle by Solon Robinson in Louisville, Kentucky.  Rice, born in New York, either based his song and shuffling dance on 'the Jim Crow', which he saw performed on the streets by an elderly disabled African American wearing ragged clothes, or on a song and dance performed by a stablehand in Kentucky. The lyrics and the structure of the song allowed Rice to incorporate local gossip or issues in it, and after each verse and chorus he did the 'Jump Jim Crow' dance. It became such a success that he performed in many parts of America, including Washington in 1833. Jim Crow established Rice as one of the leading entertainers of his era, and he collected and popularised other authentic African American songs and dances. \n\nIn 1836 Rice toured in England, Scotland and Ireland for a year, and was a huge hit at London's Surrey Theatre. This figurine is modelled after a music sheet illustration for the song 'Jim Crow!' issued after his appearance at the Surrey.  Rice went on to incorporate his character into extravaganzas that he wrote including \u2018Jim Crow in London\u2019 or \u2018Jim Crow in Foreign Service\u2019.  Rice is seen as the originator of the blackface minstrel show although he always performed alone and not as part of a troupe.",

Harding, p.306, fig.1123\n'Half of each verse is chorus, and then all the chorus is motion - so that it is of a compound and really complex character.  Mr. Crow's agility in describing the evolutions that the words enjoin - for he addresses himself in the imperative mood 'Jump Jim Crow' - is truly magnificent.  He has all the velocity of a dancing master, with the quaint capers of a cleave-boy - the bewitching grace of Douvernay, in partnership with the sylph-like movement of Taglioni.  He varies his jumpings to an infinite extent, starting with different steps, and terminating with different positions in each verse.  Then there are eight verses to the song, and it is encored six times; which draws deeply upon Mr. Crow's ingenuity to vary the pantomime, and re-model the extravagance of this grotesque tradition.  And so he does; for each bound he gives is other than the last, which proves that motion is commensurate with space, and of course illimitable.'\nContemporary source quoted in <i>Demons of Disorder</i>, p.75.\n<i>Demons of Disorder.
