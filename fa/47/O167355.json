            "public_access_description": "On its own, the qipao is itself a modernised form of the dress worn by Manchu and Han women of the Qing dynasty (1644-1911). During the Republican period (1911-1949), the qipao was promoted as the dress of modern China, identifiably 'Chinese' on the one hand, and moving away from 'feudal' associations with the imperial past. \n\nIn its earlier form, the modern qipao was relatively loose and comfortable, a symbol of simplicity and frugality. By the 1940s, under the influence of Western tailoring, the dress had become tailored to be much more form-fitting (and fashionable). This example, made in the 1960s, retains the loose, comfortable cut of the qipao's earlier style, and may not have been considered fashionable for younger audiences. It is however, the geometric prints that update the design and make it visually interesting. Still it demonstrates that the qipao became a classic staple in women's wardrobe, and is a versatile dress that may be adapted to different styles and tastes. The dress is made in warm thick rayon, and may have been intended to be worn in cooler seasons.",
