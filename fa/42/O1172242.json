            "public_access_description": "The sitter of this elegant neoclassical medallion has been identified as the agricultural reformer and Whig politician Francis Russell, 5th Duke of Bedford (1765-1802).  It was linked to a bronze medal engraved by John Gregory Hancock by Errol Manners, and this in turn is thought to be after a wax portrait of 1801 by Catherine Andras, now in the museum's collection. \nThe medallion is in Derby biscuit porcelain and is the only one with this subject now known. Biscuit portrait medallions of Mrs Duesbury (wife of the factory's owner) and of the Duke of Portland (a client of the factory) were in the collection of William Bemrose in 1898 but are now lost. According to Bemrose, a Derby porcelain collector and historian of the factory, 'Medallions appear to have been seldom made at Derby, probably on account of the biscuit body not being suitable for that purpose \u2026 From enquiries I am unaware of other medallions having been made at Derby' (A Descriptive Catalogue of Porcelain and other Art Objects in the Collection of William Bemrose., F.S.A., privately printed, 1898). Bemrose attributed his medallions to the modeller J. J. Sp\u00e4ngler, probably in part because Sp\u00e4ngler is known to have modelled some of the best Derby biscuit of the early 1790s, and probably partly because Sp\u00e4ngler's contract specifies that he was 'at liberty to make portraits and other small work in his extra time.' However, Sp\u00e4ngler left the factory in 1795, and the style of the sitter's hair and his dates suggest the portrait was probably modelled about 1798-1802.  The discovery of the Andras wax portrait and the very similar bronze medal made after it, would suggest that this little-known female sculptor was in fact responsible.  Porcelain manufacturers must have used many artists like her to produce models, most of whose names have been lost today.  We know that she sold casts of some of her reliefs and like many artists, she probably made her living taking commissions for decorative work or working as a drawing teacher, showing her work in small society exhibitions.",

Secondly, and possibly more significantly, he was the owner and landlord of the building leased in 1773 by the first William Duesbury, the factory's proprietor, in which his London showrooms were located from 1774 until 1806.  It is conceivable that the order for the medallion's manufacture came about because of this landlord and tenant relationship.'",
