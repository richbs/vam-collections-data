The name Perugino refers presumably to Paolo Gismondi, known as Paolo Perugino (1612-1685), or possibly to Giovanni Domenico Cerrini, known as Cavaliere Perugino (1609 x 1681). Both these artists are too little known as draughtsmen to make it possible to judge how much credit should be given to the old attribution.",
