In form it resembles a group of folding stools of the 6th and 7th centuries. These have been found in a wide area, ranging from France, the Carpathian basin, to Italy and one to North West Iran. It is thought that they may have been produced in the Byzantine sphere of influence, quite possibly in northern Italy. More recently it has been suggested that they may have been produced in Rome. The currently-known comparable examples all have decoration that is more complex and varied than that on the V&A example.",
