            "public_access_description": "This door probably belonged to a major public building in the German city of Nuremberg because it is decorated with the arms of the city. The pine door is covered with sheet iron that contains a lozenge shaped design. In addition to the arms of the city, two other symbols can be found within the lozenges: the displayed single-headed eagle of the King of Germany, and the rampant double-tailed lion of the King of Bohemia. The presence of these animals suggests that the door dates to the late fourteenth century because both Charles IV (1316-1378) and Wenceslas (1361-1400) were both kings of Germany and Bohemia.\n\nThe use of iron on doors was extremely practical as it made them more robust and able to protect a building from the threats of the outside world. This example has a small iron grille known as a guichet, which allows the occupants of the building to see who was outside the door. This lozenge-shaped opening is kept secure through the use of iron trellis-work that criss-crosses across the guichet.",
