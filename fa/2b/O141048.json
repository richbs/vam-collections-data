(Kay Bojesen was one of Georg Jensen's first apprentices and became an important Danish silversmith and designer who believed in functionalist design. Stephensen's work reflected Bojesen's influence.)\n\nStephensen's hollowware designs for Jensen are characterised by subtle lines and plain, unornamented forms. Many of the pieces draw on traditional Japanese design. In fact, Stephensen wrote a book called \"Brugsting Fra Japan\" (\"Useful Things from Japan\").\n\nStephensen's work was included in many important exhibitions around the world and he received many prizes. He was awarded the Eckersberg medal (1948) and several medals at the Milan Triennale. \n\nFrom GEORG JENSEN HOLLOWWARE, THE SILVERFUND COLLECTION, David A. Taylor & Jason W. Laskey, 2003",
