The fairy costumes and fantasy elements are set in a 'real' world, inspired by the soaring architectural fantasies of the 17th and 18th centuries and costumes based upon mid-late 17th-century fashions, mixing English, Spanish and French period styles.\n\nThis design is for the Third Prince in Act I of the ballet. He is one of the four suitors for the hand of Princess Aurora who each give her a rose during a formal ballet courtship dance - hence the popular title, the Rose Adagio. The four Princes are often portrayed as from the four points of the compass or representing different lands, but in this production, though identifiable from their costumes, they were simply programmed as First Prince, Second Prince, Third Prince and Fourth Prince. An inscription shows that Messel conceived this costume as Prince of the Western Isles - his way of distinguishing between the four. The costume uses Messel's favourite deep, earthy colour range - grey greens, deep reddish pinks highlighted with gold.  \n\nOliver Messel (1904-1978) was Britain\u2019s leading theatre designer throughout the 1930s, \u201840s and \u201850s, mastering every aspect of entertainment - ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue - as well as working in interior decoration and textile design. His lavish, painterly and romantic concepts were perfectly in tune with the times and earned him an international reputation. By 1960, however, that style was becoming unfashionable, and Messel gradually abandoned theatre and built a new career designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.",

The production was in the repertory for nearly twenty-five years.  Messel revised the designs several times, with major revisions in 1952 and 1960 and he reworked the designs when the production was mounted in 1959 for the Royal Ballet Touring Company.  \nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's theatre designs and other designs and artefacts.  The designs were briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being housed at the V&A from 1981 on indefinite loan.  The V&A Theatre Museum purchased the Oliver Messel collection from Lord Snowdon in 2005.\n\nHistorical significance: The production of <i>The Sleeping Beauty</i> was an immediate success and established itself as the Sadler's Wells (now Royal) Ballet's 'signature' work, associated with many key events in the company's history.  These included their first sensational appearance in New York in 1949 (which established the company's international reputation in America) and Russia in 1961, when they took the ballet, performed by a British company barely thirty years old, back to the place of its birth in St Petersburg.  Messel's designs were a significant part of the ballet's success.  Sarah Woodcock said of this production  \u201c<i>The Sleeping Beauty</i> was to be Messel\u2019s biggest and most enduring production \u2026 The production was performed nearly one thousand one hundred and fifty times, from London to Los Angeles, from Leeds to Leningrad, becoming the Company\u2019s \u2018signature ballet\u2019.\u201d  (Pinkham, ed., 1983).",
