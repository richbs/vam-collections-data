A spokesperson for the production confirmed reports that the production company behind <i>Tess of the D'Urbervilles </i> had gone into receivership. It is believed that a number of unpaid bills have been left behind - with rumours suggesting that the production company can not even pay the crew to get the scenery etc out of the Savoy Theatre - as the spokesperson said, it is unfortunately, 'all a bit of a mess'. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
