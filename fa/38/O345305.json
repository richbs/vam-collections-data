After some work in Italy he moved to Paris in 1849 to further his training under Ary Scheffer and Fran\u00e7ois Rude. He established his own pottery in rue Hall\u00e9, Montrouge, Paris, working there from 1853-1871, when he returned to Turin as Professor of Ceramics at the Accademia Albertina.\n\nDevers designed both decorative wares and architectural ceramics, such as for the churches of La Trinit\u00e9 and St-Amboise, with panels made at the specialist tileworks of Maison Pichenot-Loebnitz. Throughout his career, his classical training underpinned his designs and he was much influenced by the faience of the 15th century Della Robbia family of Florence. He was especially attracted to the rich background colours of blue or gold  and frequently used motifs associated with Italian or French Renaissance ornament.",
