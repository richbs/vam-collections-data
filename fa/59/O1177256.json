Starting in the late 1970's to the early 1980's The Jam had four members, Paul Weller, Bruce Foxton, Rick Buckler and Steve Brookes and had 18 Top 40 Hits in the UK over a five year period until their break up in 1982.\n\nWith t-shirts becoming a staple fashion item for youth and rock 'n' rollers in the 1960s, promotional t-shirts printed to advertise products also became common place. This trend moved from corporate arena to youth movement with the merging of rock 'n' roll, advertising and fashion into the creation of the concert t-shirt, of which this is an example. Not only does it advertise a concert the wearer has been to, but concert and band t-shirts can also show the wearer's allegiance to specific musical subcultures or youth movements.",
