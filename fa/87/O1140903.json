It was modelled on photographer Sir Benjamin Stone's 'National Photographic Record Association' (NPRA, operating 1897-1910) that recorded British local ceremonies and customs. The NPRA archive is housed at the V&A. Sykes' project lasted seven years and he travelled all over the country, covering approximately one hundred events. He said of the project: 'I tended to avoid folk club revival country customs, and those events that seemed to me, to be more to do with town hall tourism than local history. As a young documentary photographer I was interested in the contemporaneity of the participants, the coexistence of ancient and modern, and of course of the documentary value of what I was doing'.",
