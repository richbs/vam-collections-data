The spandrels contain a leafy, flowering spray on a yellow ground, while the white field is decorated with isolated flowering plants in blue, mauve and red, in off-set rows.  The arch is surrounded by small square forms containing lozenges in reserve against a pale red or blue ground; these are in turn edged either side with a narrow meander band in blue on a yellow field.  On the outer side of each is a long vertical panel edged with a red resist band and containing a small vase from which there is a tall cypress tree outlined by a series of narrow bands in red, blue and yellow; this terminates in a line of vase and bulb forms - all on a white field.  Across the top is a decorative white ground band, part framing a rectangle edged in yellow containing two arch forms each with a cypress tree infill on a white ground. The former decorative band is patterned with a repeat flowering blue stem and red and blue flower heads. To the outer side of the cypress tree panels is a vertical line of oblongs, each containing either a floral spray with red arch spandrels or a boteh and leaf motif with blue arch spandrels, all on a white ground.  This band is edged either side by  a yellow stripe and the red resist band.  At the top are similar oblongs, four side by side arranged horizontally containing similar motifs. Along the top a series of squares and rectangles edged in the narrow yellow border continues the floral theme.  Along the bottom is a wide band with a blue stem meander on a white ground bearing red exotic blossoms.  Below this is a yellow narrow band with white lozenges each containing a blue and red flower head. The outermost side border has a cypress tree on a rocky mound over which is a section of the final bottom yellow border, terminating in a series of vase and bulbs on a white ground.  This theme is carried across the top in a series of architectural 'onion' dome and decorative spikes.\nColours: two shades of red, blue, yellow, mauve, green, black.",
