The Irish-born artist, who worked in London and was probably the most important neoclassical painter of 18th-century Britain, is mainly known for his historical and allegorical subjects, and for his eccentric political views. Very much involved with the politics of his time he held Republican views, and made himself some enemies as a result. He was elected Professor of painting of the Royal Academy in 1782, and was later expelled from the same institution in 1790.",
