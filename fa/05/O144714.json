However, little is known about printing or the makers of printed textiles in the 14th century, the period to which this piece can be dated stylistically. Its flowing pattern, composed of flowering vines, birds and beasts, appears to be typical of the second quarter of the century and may emulate the patterns on expensive woven silks. If so, the printed version was probably cheaper and made the design more accessible to consumers of limited means.\n\nThe first reference to European textile printing dates to the early fifteenth century  when it is mentioned in trade regulations in Florence. The technique was described in a treatise published by the Italian painter Cennino Cennini in 1437, and had spread to Germany and England by the last quarter of the century, and to Sweden by the early sixteenth century. It was similar to the method used to create woodcut illustrations in books: a wooden block was engraved with an image or pattern, pigment was applied to its surface, and it was then stamped on to linen.",

            "historical_context_note": "The origin of these textiles is open to debate. In the Museum's original accession register entry they were attributed to Germany, although more recently very similar pieces have been labelled in the museum as Italian (monochromatic prints with brocaded-silk style designs).  A smaller fragment of this textile is also in the collection (7027-1860), as well as three fragments of blue dyed linen (7095-1860, 7095A-1860, and 1514-1899) that have a print which is identical to that upon a silk dalmatic preserved in Straslund. This print features a bird, probably a heron or a crane, reacting to a lion-like animal, entwined with flowing vines and foliage. It seems possible that the printed textiles emulated more expensive woven silks, making identical patterns and designs more accessible to consumers of limited means, although even so, they would not have been \"cheap\".\n\nLittle is known about printed linens of this period. Studies of medieval textiles often focus upon the weaving industry, or upon decorated silk and woollen textiles. Painters of the period seem to have favoured plain linen and cotton over their printed equivalents, reserving their portrayals of patterned textiles for silks and woollens. However, these flowing patterns, composed of flowering vines, and often incorporating birds and beasts, appear to be typical of the 2nd quarter of the 14th century (See Crowfoot et al., <i>Textiles and Clothing</i>. Museum of London, 2001, pp. 101 & 117).\n\n- Daniel Milford-Cottam (2006)",
