This Order was founded to defend Spain against the 'uncivilised' Moors, here symbolised by two wild men. The wild men are overcoming a dragon, a symbol of the devil. Other Christian symbols on the pyx are the phoenix, symbolising Christ's Resurrection, and the dog, a sign of fidelity. The garden on the lid with sprawling Gothic foliage may allude to Christ's capture in the Garden of Gethsemane.",
