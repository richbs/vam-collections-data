Taken while Deakin and Bacon shared a cottage in the artists' colony of Wivenhoe Park, Essex, this portrait lays bare even the tiniest physical imperfection without diminishing the power of Bacon's wide-eyed gaze, simultaneously confrontational and anguished.\n\nDeakin considered himself a painter first and was neglectful of his own photographs; as a result, most of his surviving work is torn and creased.  His reputation, which had languished after his death in 1972, was revived by the V&A's 1984 exhibition The Salvage of the Photographer.",

Deakin had wanted to be a painter and was often careless and neglectful of his photographs.  This portrait is no exception, with tears around the edges and one corner gone entirely.\n\nHistorical significance: Deakin's reputation went into decline after his death in 1972; indeed, he had all but given up photography in the last years of his life, after brief stints at <i>Vogue</i> and two small exhibitions in Soho.  Bruce Bernard rescued four boxes of photographs from his Soho flat after his death; these creased and tattered photographs formed the basis of the 1984 V&A exhibition <i>The Salvage of a Photographer</i>, which ensured Deakin's posthumous reputation.",
