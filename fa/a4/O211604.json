Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hard-wearing. Above all, they had to have the means for attaching a cord. Netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated being the katabori (shape carving), a three-dimensional carving, such as this one in the form of Sh\u00f4ki the demon-queller.\n\nBoth wood and ivory were traditionally the most widely used materials for making netsuke. Since trees grow abundantly throughout Japan, wood is not only readily available but many varieties are comparably cheap. There is also a long tradition of expertise in wood carving in Japan.",
