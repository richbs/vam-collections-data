(1) The Anholt picture is identified as the Princess Sophia (1630-1714), the twelfth child of Elizabeth of Bohemia and mother of the future George I of Great Britain. Sophia's appearance is independently quite well established.(2) TheAnholt picture does not seem to be necessarily of the same person as in these images, but family likenesses and the large formulaic element in the portraiture of these 'Bohemian' ladies makes distinction between them very difficult. \n \nThe former identification of this miniature, as in the inscription quoted above, was as the Princess Henrietta Anne, Duchess of Orleans , daughter of Charles 1. She, however, was born in 1644, only five years before the date of the miniature. A sensible emendation of the inscription would lead to Henrietta Marie (b.1626, the ninth child of Elizabeth of Bohemia), who married Sigismund Radgozki of Transylvania six months before her death of fever in 1651. Her appearance is recorded by Honthorst (3) and possibly in a miniature at Windsor (4) attributed to Thach; the images seem compatible with both of the present miniatures but, as with Sophia, distinguishing likenesses of these sisters seems an impossible task.  \n \nThe latest suggestion of Anne of Gonzaga (1616-1684), depends on comparison with an engraving 'probably that by Rousselet' - a suggestion credited in the V&A cataloguing (5) to Goulding, but without reference. Anne was the second daughter of Charles de Gonzague, Duc de Nevers. A Catholic, her marriage in 1645 to Prince Edward (1625-1663), Elizabeth of Bohemia's eighth child, led to their alienation from the Protestant Court of The Hague and their residence in Paris. Both culturally and geographically, therefore, Anne seems only a remote possibility. Furthermore, she was born in 1616 and as a woman of thirty-three in 1649 seems less plausible than any of her younger sisters-in-law.  \n \nThe great pity lying behind this confusion is the fate of the Craven family collection of 'Bohemian' portraits, imprudently allowed to be dispersed at auction over the years, especially between 1968 and 1984. The Honthorst literature is generally inadequate in relation to his portraiture, and particularly insensitive to the symbolic iconography that he deployed as a Court painter to the Stadtholder in The Hague after 1637.(6) Rosenberg and Slive, for example, comment on Honthurst's contribution to the decoration of Huis ten Bosch (the Dutch royal palace) for Amalia van Solms, the Stadtholder's widow, in 1649-50: 'These allegorical pictures are a document of the emptiness of official courtly taste at a time when Hals worked in increased isolation and Rembrandt was at the beginning of his mature period.'(7) \n \nCertainly the work that he did for the Bohemian exiles, as it were in parallel to his work for the Dutch Court, seems to belong to a different world from that of Rembrandt and Hals. The last images of Frederick V before his death in 1632 show him in medallic profile as a Roman Emperor\" and in state robes, with orb and sceptre as King of Bohernia, (8) both images recalling the ambitions of 1613-21 rather than the realities of exile in the middle of the Thirty Years' War. In English terms, the iconography is Jacobean rather than Carolean - Isaac Oliver rather than Van Dyck.  \n \nThe portraiture is in that sense backward-looking, but it is so in order to make the important political point of the continuity of the struggle against the Catholic Hapsburg hegemony. Similarly, the masque costume evidently worn by the sitter for this miniature, looks back to the culture of the English Court <i>ante bellum</i>. In The Hague, the date 1649 is Significant as the year in which the Treaty of Westphalia (1648) opened the way for the return of Charles Louis (1616/17-1680) to his father's electoral state of the Palatinate. This masque costume with its feathered head-dress may even Signal an allusion in Court festivities to the dresses designed by Inigo Jones for the Masque of the Middle Temple: 'their robes were tucked up before, strange hoods of feathers and scallops about their necks, and on their heads turbans, stuck with several coloured feathers ... On their heads high sprigged feathers, compassed in coronets, like the Virginian princes' , (10) This was the masque put on by the Inns of Court to celebrate the marriage of the Princess Elizabeth to Frederick V in 1613, before she herself accompanied her husband to the Palatinate at the start of the whole Bohemian adventure.\n\n1  Letter from Dr Avon Rohr, May 1981, department files; Rudiger Joppien, 'The Dutch Vision of Brazil, <i>Johan Maurits van Nassau-Siegen</i> 1604-79: <i>A humanist Prince in Europe and Brazil, Essays on the Occasion of the Tercenterary of his Death</i>, ed.
