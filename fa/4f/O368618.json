The falling front reveals shelves with four drawers below. The bottom right hand drawer has two cut glass bottles, one for ink and one for pounce, with a tray between, the tops of the bottles and the tray being probably of silvered tin. Beneath the drawers there is a pull-out writing flap, covered in green leather, with gilt tooling. A panel of urushi lacquer (a technique of lacquer-painting) cut from the top of a Japanese box of 1640-50 is mounted on the front. Surrounding this is a border of silver foil on a background of aventurine lacquer (a French decorative finish where metallic dust was applied to the lacquer to imitate quartz).",

By the 1750s the skills necessary to re-shape panels of lacquer to create more fashionable objects were finely developed, particularly in Paris. The production of such pieces was controlled by the marchands-merciers (dealers in luxury goods). They were generally richer than cabinet-makers and it was they who laid out the capital to buy the expensive materials which were fashioned into furniture by the cabinet-makers. This delicate and luxurious writing table was probably made by Martin Carlin. It would have probably furnished a fashionable urban interior, possibly a cabinet or a boudoir. Martin Carlin became a maitre \u00e9b\u00e9niste in 1776 and died in 1785. He is known to have produced many small and expensively decorated tables for sale in shops of dealers like Daguerre and his predecessor and business partner Simon-Philippe Poirier, whose premises lay in the fashionable Rue Saint-Honor\u00e9.",
