However, his reconstructed cabinet, named on the 27th of November 1989, represented 15 communists (the red figures on the poster), 1 Peoples\u2019 Party member (the black figure), 1 socialist (the blue figure) and 3 non party men (the white figures). This led to the increase of mass demonstrations and to the dismissal of Adamec\u2019s cabinet of on the 7th of December 1989. \n\nThis opened the way for the cabinet formed by Mari\u00e1n Calfa, know as the \u2018Cabinet of National Understanding\u2019 which was accepted by president Gust\u00e1v Hus\u00e1k who resigned his position. This, in turn, led to V\u00e1clav Havel becoming president on December 29, 1989, and to the free elections organized in Czechoslovakia in June 1990. \n\n\nDesigned, printed and published in former Czechoslovakia",
