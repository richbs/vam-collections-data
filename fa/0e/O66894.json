He was the head of the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte (Vienna Workshop) textile department. The Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte was a guild of designers and craftsmen who came together with the idea of furthering the work and ideals of the Viennese Secession. It was founded by the architect Hoffmann and the designer Koloman Moser (1868-1918). The organisation manufactured a range of interior furnishings for the luxury goods market between 1903 and 1932. These were both handmade and industrially manufactured. The textile department opened in 1900. Its 80 members produced about 1,800 designs, mainly for printed fabrics for furnishings and apparel. The textiles were characterised by simplified forms and vivid colours. These were derived from Eastern European peasant art and geometric motifs in contemporary painting. They were an important influence on Art Deco ornamentation.",
