Beaumont had already produced a series of booklets on individual Diaghilev Ballets under the series title Impressions of the Russian Ballet and a number of wooden cut-out Diaghilev dancers in their famous roles.  He now decided to produce a series of hand coloured prints of typical scenes from the Diaghilev Ballet repertory.   He kept no records of when he began publishing the prints nor how many were produced, although he reckoned about twenty, mostly the work of Adrian Allinson, Ethelbert White and Randolf Schwabe who had also worked on Impressions of the Russian Ballet booklets and the wooden figures, and Eileen Mayo.  \nIn all these works, Beaumont strove to capture the exact moments of the ballet as well as artists' interpretations.  Possibly the design of each print followed the painstaking search for accuracy that had characterised the creation of the illustrations for Impressions of the Russian Ballet series, described in Bookseller at the Ballet - choosing the significant moment, watching the ballet night after night to check details of the poses and grouping (not easy when the stage was full of individual dancers and movement), going backstage to sketch scenery and borrow costumes - although some prints appear to be 'composite' rather than specific tableaux.  \nMost of the hand-colouring for Impressions of the Russian Ballet booklets was the work of Beaumont and his wife, Alice, and it is possible that both were also involved in colouring the prints, although eventually other artists were employed on both projects.\n\nHistorical significance: The Sleeping Princess was lavishly produced by Diaghilev at the Alhambra Theatre, London, in 1921.  Impressed by the long-running musical Chu-Chin-Chow, he hoped that a spectacular production would similarly recoup his fortunes, but London audiences, accustomed to an evening of short ballets, found a full-evening work of alternating mime and dances difficult to assimilate and the ballet failed to run the six-months required to recoup its expenses.  It was, however, a momentous production, the first full Russian classical ballet to be seen in England and Diaghilev noted ruefully that he had the right city but the wrong time; seventeen years later, in 1939, Ninette de Valois took the ballet into the repertory of the Vic-Wells (now Royal) Ballet and it became a foundation of the company's repertory.",
