They functioned as miniature rosaries: an 'Ave' was supposed to be said as each of the small bosses was touched, and a 'Pater Noster' at the bezel. These and other kinds of religious rings were especially popular during the 15th and the 16th centuries.\nMany \u2018decade\u2019 rings have bezels engraved with the figures of saints. This ring depicts the figures of St Barbara and St Christopher on the ridged bezel, both of whom were credited with the power to protect from sudden death. This was a matter for great concern amongst Christians as it meant dying without the last rites and absolution of the priest. It was only necessary to see a representation of St Christopher to be secure from death from the rest of the day, so this ring would have had a particularly effective use.",

They functioned as miniature rosaries: an 'Ave'  was supposed to be said as each of the small bosses was touched, and a 'Pater Noster' at the bezel. These and other kinds of religious rings were particularly popular during the 15th and then the 16th centuries. \nMany early \u2018decade\u2019 rings have bezels engraved with the figures of saints. The present ring shows the figures of St Barbara and St Christopher on the bezel, both of whom were credited with the power to protect from sudden death. This was a matter for great concern amongst Christians as it meant dying without the last rites and absolution of the priest. It was only necessary to see a representation of St Christopher to be secure from death from the rest of the day, so this ring would have been seen as particularly  useful, imbued with a quasi-magical quality understood as the image of the saint extending its protective sphere around the body of the wearer. St Christopher, furthermore, was particularly venerated in England in the 15th century, and so his image would have been extremely popular at the time this ring was created. His image adorned not just rings, but other objects worn on the person, such as girdle pendants and badges, and both men and women wore them for protection and adornment.\nThis ring is also adorned with an inscription on the inside, which reads \u2018A MA VYE\u2019. It is not unusual for religious rings to bear this kind of amorous inscription. There is another 15th century English ring in the V&A collections, inscribed with the figures of St Barbara and St Catherine(?) with \u2018de bon cor\u2019 inscribed on the inside and there is also a 15th century silver poesy ring of French provenance in the British Museum, which is inscribed \u2018a ma vie de coer entier\u2019. It may be that the inscription on the present ring is just the shortened form of this sentiment, which perhaps can be best translated as \u2018to my life (i.e. the ring\u2019s recipient) with all my heart\u2019. This indicates that as well as a protective ring, this object may also have functioned as a love token - a gift between lovers, even perhaps a wedding ring.",
