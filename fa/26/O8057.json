Copeland's, like other manufacturers, made their largest and showiest pieces for such international fairs, to demonstrate their technical capabilities, the skill of their painters and the quality of their design. Although the shape is unremarkable, the size of this vase is a technical masterpiece and the painted decoration by Charles Ferdinand H\u00fcrten is a demonstration of the highest-quality flower painting.\n\nPeople\nCharles Ferdinand H\u00fcrten (1818-1901) was born in Germany but worked mainly in France and Britain. He was one of Europe's foremost flower painters, and worked independently for decorating workshops in Paris. After seeing his painting in the national exhibition in Paris in 1858,  Copeland invited H\u00fcrten to join their company in 1859. He did so and stayed there until his retirement in 1897. His work featured in all the firm's displays in major exhibitions during those years.",
