A small running stitch outlines the edge of the coat, waistcoat and their pocket flaps. Buttons covered in red foil and embroidered with silver spangles and silver thread. The button band is strengthened with some kind of stiffening which is sewn down about 4.5cm from the outer edge with a similarly expert running stitch which is nearly invisible.\n[Coat] Constructed from two front and two back panels, the coat has full back pleats and skirts, and a small stand-up collar. The sleeves are wrist-length and end in a cuff, also lined in silk. The silk twill lining is the same throughout the coat, back and front, except in the sleeves where an off-white linen twill is used. The cut edge of the broadcloth is used round the edges. There is some stronger rough linen interlining in the shoulder area (visible through worn areas in the silk). Coat and pocket flaps are lined with light blue silk taffeta which has been eased around the edge of the coat front and pocket flap to appear like a fine line of piping.\n\nPockets have a double flap; the upper flap with a deep three-pointed flap with two functioning buttons and buttonholes, the middle button and buttonhole are purely decorative. Below this flap is a second flap invisible from outside as it is hidden by the decorative flap. It is made of the same wool and fastens with one button covered in the same fabric as the coat.  The inside of the pockets is made of a strong undyed linen and is 27cm deep.\n\nAll buttonholes are cut, but the coat probably only fastened across the chest; two hooks and eyes are built into the outer edge, the first at the neckline and the second some 13.5 cm below it.\n\nAt the back of the neck a small rouleau tape of the silk has been made, presumably so that the coat could be hung on a hook.\n\nWear and tear visible on lining of the body of the coat in areas where abrasion would be the natural effect of putting it on or taking it off. Very little wear otherwise, except for the edge of one sleeve.\n[Waistcoat] Front sides and pocket flaps lined with blue silk, so that that the merest sensation of a blue edge is visible. Upper back lined in flannel; lower back (skirt panel) lined in blue silk on right hand side and in off-white linen on left. 12 buttons and corresponding buttonholes (buttons on right hand side of front opening); 3 buttons at each pocket flat, only the outer two intended to fasten through the corresponding buttonhole on the pocket flap (one uncut buttonhole in the centre of the three pointed flap and a button that is sewn to be half visible opposite it). The back is attached to the small collar with a gap of 6.5 cm between the two sides (i.e. it is split down the back). There are 3 linen ties on either side of the back opening at fairly regular intervals.",

Once the cloth had been selected, the customer would have had his tailor make up his suit to measure. Sometimes tailors purchased the fabrics on behalf of their customers.",
