The latter pair is after an engraving by Antoine Coypel.\n[Cup] On the outer surface of the cup between acanthus ornament are three oval medallions each containing mythological groups of three personnages including Roman goddesses. Underneath the cup, within a gold mount is painted a woman holding a distaff charged with wool or flax for spinning. Inside the cup is a scene of a stag-hunt with a flying putto shooting an arrow in the direction of the stag. This scene surrounds a central medallion painted with the goddess Diana recumbent beside two hunting dogs.\n[Saucer] Inside the saucer is one circular central medallion surrounded by four others, all contiguous to the central one. The surrounding space is filled with Baroque ornament of acanthus and putti masks. The central medallion is painted with a lady, sitting d\u00e9collet\u00e9e before a mirror, presumably at her toilette. She holds an implement, possibly a pen and a cup and saucer lies on the table before her. The surrounding medallions are each painted with pairs of lovers from mythology.\n\nOn the back of the saucer, within a border of putti and garlands of flowers on a back ground is stipple-painted a landscape featuring trees, picturesque ruins, a man and woman standing in conversation and a man and woman seated with their backs to the viewer, in the foreground.",

Both pieces are mounted in gold to enrich their overall appearance as well as more practically to protect the enamel and disguise the copper edges. These skilled artists, along with their elder brother Pierre, learned enamelling from their father, also Pierre, a Huguenot who had left France by 1630 for Protestant Switzerland. After working for some years as enamellers to the Brandenburg court in Berlin, Jean-Pierre and Ami moved back to Geneva in 1700 where they worked until their deaths in 1723 and 1724 respectively.  \n\nThe brothers specialised in painting watch-cases with delicate mythological, allegorical and Biblical subjects after engraved sources. This cup and saucer is a more unusual object type in their production and is among their best work.  The decorative motifs are typical manifestations of late Baroque ornament with flower garlands, acanthus leaves, putti and masks.  A landscape underneath the saucer features picturesque ruins and in the central medallion inside the saucer a fashionable lady sits d\u00e9collet\u00e9e before her mirror, presumably at her toilette.  The other medallions contain mythological scenes, most involving Roman goddesses and their lovers.",

Pierre is recorded as living in Geneva by 1630 where he was apprenticed to the goldsmith Laurent L\u00e9gar\u00e9. He taught enamelling to his sons Pierre II (1647-96/98), Jean-Pierre and Ami. First Pierre II, then his younger brothers were employed as enamellers to the Brandenburg court in Berlin. In 1682 Jean-Pierre and Ami worked in formal partnership. Following Pierre II's death, Jean-Pierre and Ami moved back to Geneva in 1700 where they continued to work in enamel until their own deaths in the 1720s. Watch-cases were the principal staple of their considerable production with mythological (and often erotic), allegorical and Biblical subjects after engraved sources their favoured designs. This cup and saucer is a more unusual object type for the brothers Huaut and is amongst their best work.",
