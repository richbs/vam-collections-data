As she describes it: 'A member of the crackpot UKIP party declares in his role of Member of the European Parliament that women should spend more time \u201ccleaning behind the fridge\u201d and serving their husbands \u2013 a comment that makes UKIP the laughing stock of the nation.'\n\n'Marf' drew daily topical cartoons for the Evening Standard between March 2002 and August 2005, moving to the Londoner's Diary page in August 2003. The drawings cover key political and social issues of the period, providing a vivid and often hilarious response to the main news of the day. The Evening Standard is London's only evening newspaper, publishing up to five editions a day. In Marf's own words: 'The cartoonist needs to keep up with the rapid pace of event.'",
