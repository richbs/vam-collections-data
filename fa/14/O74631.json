He combined stylised natural elements with a subtle and complex geometric structure. His understanding of natural forms was based on close study. He also had passionate enthusiasm and energy. All this increased his skill as a pattern designer.\n\nMorris\u2019s papers were all printed by Jeffery & Co. of Islington, London, using wooden blocks. He annotated this design with detailed instructions. He wanted to ensure that the workmen would carry out his intentions exactly when they printed the paper.",

Published to coincide with an exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum, 9 May-1 Sept. 1996.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n'<b>L.8</b> <i>Vine</i> wallpaper \n<b>a</b> Original design \nWilliam Morris, <i>c</i>.1873 \nPencil and watercolour, 81.5 x 65.2 cm \nInscribed with instructions \nV&A (E.1074-1988) \n\n<b>b</b> Wallpaper sample, <i>Vine, 50</i> \nDesigned by William Morris, first issued 1874 \nPrinted by Jeffrey & Co. for Morris Marshall, Faulkner & Co. \nBlock-printed in distemper colours, 81.5 x 65.2 cm \nV&A (E.485-1919) Given by Morris & Co. \nNOT ILLUSTRATED \n\n<b>c</b>\nWallpaper sample, <i>Vine, 80</i> \nDesigned by William Morris, this colourway first issued 1875 \nPrinted by Jeffrey & Co. for Morris & Co. \nBlock-printed in distemper and oil colours on foiled and lacquered crape-embossed paper, 94.0 x 48.5 cm \nWilliam Morris Society, Kelmscott House, London (WMS/WP/1/138) \n\nLike <i>Jasmine</i> this too uses the \u2018layered\u2019 format. The background of stylised willow leaves is overlaid and interwoven with a vertically meandering slender vine stem bearing, in almost circular scrolls, bunches of grapes and groups of leaves. The central portion of the design, a complete repeat, is fully worked and coloured and the beginnings of the adjoining repeats are clearly traced in. Notes, in Morris\u2019s hand, give instructions on the order of printing from the blocks. \n\nAfter publication as an ordinary distemper print, <i>Vine</i> was very soon brought out on a gold crape-embossed ground, a material which had earlier appeared in Jeffrey\u2019s own range, but which the firm was now using for the first time. The gold, glimpsed through the deep greens, is reminiscent of the firm\u2019s early painted furniture. It demonstrates the move into richer wallpaper effects and, at 40s. a roll, was extremely expensive; the ordinary distemper print cost 12s. \n\n<i>Willow</i>, issued in the same year, is a simple pattern derived from the backprint of <i>Vine</i>.'",
