The lining is formed from a rectangular piece of linen (undyed; plain weave; approx. 12x12 tpc), folded over and sewn along one edge (above the skull). The final shape is a long rectangle with a rounded corner at the crown. The top edge of the hood (above the forehead) is hemmed with a pink thread  sewn in plaited form. The rest of the linen is hemmed by turning over the edge and sewing with a whip stitch in a blue, linen thread (poorly dyed). The covering is formed by patches of colourful silk (pink, blue, green, yellow) roughly sewn over the linen. One patch one either side is a pink/red linen patch, z-spun, sewn with blue thread. The patches are joined with a whip stitch in undyed linen thread. The patches are geometric and form Xs, triangles and squares within squares. The cowl is further decorated with small holes sewn with embroidered buttonhole stitch in a variety of colourful threads (blue, pink, black, yellow). The pink appears to be silk but the others may be linen threads. It is stained.",

The final shape is a long rectangle with a rounded corner at the crown. The top edge of the hood (above the forehead) is hemmed with a pink thread  sewn in plaited form. The rest of the linen is hemmed by turning over the edge and sewing with a whip stitch in a blue, linen thread (poorly dyed). The covering is formed by patches of colourful silk (pink, blue, green, yellow) roughly sewn over the linen. One patch one either side is a pink/red linen patch, z-spun, sewn with blue thread. The patches are joined with a whip stitch in undyed linen thread. The patches are geometric and form Xs, triangles and squares within squares. The cowl is further decorated with small holes sewn with embroidered buttonhole stitch in a variety of colourful threads (blue, pink, black, yellow). The pink appears to be silk but the others may be linen threads. It is stained.",
