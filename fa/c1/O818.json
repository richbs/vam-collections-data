Three small suspension rings are attached to the sides of the lamp, the areas around them gilded and outlined in red. A narrow tube for the wick is attached to the interior at the bottom of the lamp. Said to have been found in a Christian monastery in Syria. The use of figural decoration showes the pleasures of hunting with hawks. This indicates that the lamp was made for secular rather than religious use.",

It is the only known example of an Islamic lamp with figures in the gilded and enamelled decoration. This indicates that it was made for use in a secular context, since figures were never used on objects made for mosques and other religious buildings. The lamp has a boldly waisted body, rounded below and flaring above. To this were added a high foot, three suspension loops and, at the bottom of the reservoir, a tubular wick-holder. The body was blown in a mould, giving it a gently ribbed exterior. The sparse decoration consists principally of a trio of mounted falconers, each set between pairs of suspension hooks.",

Ribs are the only molded pattern ever used on enamelled vessels (see Kenesson in Ward, Gilded and Enamelled Glass of the Near and Middle East, 1998, pl. 12.4 for an example in Washington). The shallowness of the ribs on this vessel suggests the lamp was reblown or optic blown outside the mold.",
