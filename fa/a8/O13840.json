Examples were first brought to Britain in the 1820s. Machine embroidery developed for men\u2019s waistcoats and women\u2019s dresses throughout the 1840s and 1850s. Various inventions of machines for sewing seams occurred in the 1840s, but they did not become commercially available until the late 1850s. It was several decades before the sewing machine was widely used in homes and by professional dressmakers.",
