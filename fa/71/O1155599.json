The date of his birth (11 Jan 1832) on this print is incorrect, but Stratton's manager, P.T. Barnum, always claimed that Tom Thumb was older than he was, so that his stature seemed all the more remarkable. The date of his birth is generally agreed to be 4 January 1838.\n\nTrained to sing and dance by the American showman P.T. Barnum, Stratton was successfully marketed throughout America and Europe and appeared twice before Queen Victoria in 1844.\n\nA miniature calling card with the typed name 'Gen. Tom Thumb' is affixed to the front of the print.",
