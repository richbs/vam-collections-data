His subjects are drawn from scenes in and around Los Angeles, including the porn industry in which he works as a stills photographer, mostly on gay-themed productions. This picture was also used as the cover image for his book of erotic photography, 'Dreamland' (Powerhouse, 2000). He often chooses to picture his subjects from un-expected angles, as here, in a way which is suggestive rather than explicit.\n\nThis print was published by Counter Editions in 2002 in a portfolio of 14 works by contemporary artists.",
