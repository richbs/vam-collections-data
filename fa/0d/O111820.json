With music by Eugene Goossens, it was originally performed as part of the revue Riverside Nights at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith. It opened on 15 June 1926 and ran for nearly 50 consecutive performances.  The original cast included Frederick Ashton as the costumier Monsieur du Chic and Marie Rambert as his partner Orchid\u00e9e, who are the dancers portrayed by Astrid Zydower from photographs of the original production. A new production of A Tragedy of Fashion was choreographed by Ian Spink to mark the centenary of Frederick Ashton's birth and performed at Sadler's Wells Theatre in May 2004\n\nThe original synopsis for A Tragedy of Fashion was written by Ashley Dukes, Dame Marie Rambert's husband. The ballet was inspired by the incident recounted in the letters of Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9 in which the French chef, Vatel, killed himself for shame, when the fish arrived too late at a banquet for Louis XIV. To avoid comparisons with L\u00e9onide Massine\u2019s ballet of a comic dinner party, The Good-humoured Ladies (1917), Dukes transferred the idea to the world of fashion. To Dukes\u2019s proposed synopsis Ashton added the ideas that Monsieur du Chic should commit suicide with his cutting scissors and that the ballet should end with a lament by the mannequins for their dead master.",

The production ran for nearly fifty consecutive performances and was last performed in its entirety in 1926.

Earle Grey as the Viscount Viscosa OBE. \n\nAs th ballet opens Monsieur du Chic indicates his joy at the creation of his new model, which will mark the summit of his achievement in the world of fashion. He summons Orchid\u00e9e and they rejoice together over the launching of the new model. Orchid\u00e9e celebrates the triumph of fashion.  A young beauty, the Viscountess Viscosa brings her decrepit old beau to watch her choose her clothes. Mannequins enter and display some of the costumier\u2019s creations, which are rejected. Monsieur du Chic is undismayed in the conviction that his latest creation will prove irresistible. Orchid\u00e9e appears in the latest model, Volupt\u00e9 du D\u00e9sert. The Viscountess laughs at it. In her opinion it is fit for a mummy. Orchid\u00e9e protests that it allows full freedom of movement. She turns cartwheels and performs the splits by way of proving its flexibility. The lady is still contemptuous. In despair, Orchid\u00e9e spins on her belly like a top, upon which the scandalised customers withdraw\n\nMonsieur du Chic cannot endure the shame of seeing his work of art rejected. He appeals for sympathy to Orchid\u00e9e, who laughs and hands him his scissors. With this instrument of his glory he stabs himself to the heart. Orchid\u00e9e sheds two tears over his corpse but she is already late for an amorous appointment and therefore sheds no more.",

Chanel to design the ballet, but Marie Rambert pointed out that they couldn't afford her, and anyway she didn't believe that fashion designers were the most effective designers of stage costumes. She therefore invited her friend Sophie Fedorovitch, who had designed Frances James\u2019 1925 ballet <i>Les Nenuphars</i>, to undertake the task, launching a major designer into the professional theatre. The backdrop showed a panel of painted mirrors under an arch of a giant pair of cutting scissors, and the costumes for the women reflected trends in fashion. Fashion photographs by, for example, Cecil Beaton show similar styles in the late 1920s. Orchid\u00e9e was first seen in a black and blue dress with geometric panels. Later, she models 'Volupt\u00e9 du D\u00e9sert' also referred to in discussions of the work as Le Sporren, a gold-green evening jacket with wide lapels worn with a divided skirt. The dresses worn by the other models have the dropped waist of the period, \u2018Desir du cygne\u2019 was white with blue trimming on the bodice and lining the full skirt, \u2018Rose d\u2019Isphan\u2019 bright pink with low-cut back with a short skirt and large bustle-like bow.
