            "physical_description": "Plain weave cotton embroidered with silk in straight stitches, with traces of woven silk binding. This is a trouser panel which has been cut and seamed to form the front panel of a lady's bodice.  If the two 'wing' like pieces are attached to the curved edges next to them, they form a darted section over each breast.\nDescribed as a trouser panel: Directional design with the top of the pattern at the bottom of the panel, so that the wearer saw the correct pattern. The Museum Number is in the top left hand corner. There is a border along the bottom with a red blossom and a small red and yellow flower surrounded by small light green leaves.  There is a green embroidered line along the lower part of the right hand side.\nThe pattern is a series of diagonal lines from lower right to upper left.  These are chevron lines in light and dark green.\nThere are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: dark green ground with a round red blossom on a chevron stem alternating with a light green blossom also on a chevron stem.\n[2] wider stripe in two designs: [a] divided into obvious lozenges, one containing a pointed red flower above a smaller red flower and 2 red buds and the other containing 3 round red blossoms.\n[b] similar arrangement with a pointed red flower with 4 small white flowers forming a lozenge above it and a group of 3 to either side and a sprig with a line of light green, a white and a red flower.\nThreads: Silk, 2S: dark blue, red, dark green, yellow, orange, light green, light blue, white.\nSome of the embroidery on orange and some in white has been worked through a cotton backing.\n\nDescribed as a bodice panel, from the back: the trouser panel was cut down the centre and cut to either side in seams curving out from the lower edge then sweeping over the centre of each breast. An irregularly shaped section has been removed from the upper corners of this piece, with a concave lower edge; a decorative neckline has been cut. Ten buttonholes have been cut and there are two horizontal slits for pockets.  These and the seams have been carefully sewn-up [by a conservator?].\n\nThere is evidence of a cream silk binding down both sides and a pink, yellow and green [?] silk binding along the upper left hand edge [near the Museum Number].",
