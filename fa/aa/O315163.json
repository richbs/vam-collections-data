Field: undecorated yellow niche with narrow blue, red, white and red borders outlining angular, doubly indented pointed niche; the final red border expands to form the ground area within this field. Final red border expands to form the ground area with the field rectangle beyond the niche which has white blossoms (two are carnations) and serrated leaves on white stems.\n\nMain border: yellow ground with large-scale pattern of two alternating stylised blossoms, each with a pair of sickle shaped leaves in two colours. In the upper third (where weaving begins) the designs are complimentary and below that the right-hand border becomes an exact copy of the left so that the two leaves around one large motif on the right-hand border takes on an S shape.\n\nInner border: yellow ground with black centred alternately red and pink stars separated by small oblique cloudbands in white which, in the upper border, form an X motif.\n\nOuter border: lower border missing. As inner border but with white stars on red ground and black, blue and yellow cloudbands - forming X motifs in the upper border. \n\nWarp: (a) yellow in borders; (b) red in the field with irregular interchange within the inner border where the returning wefts are now visible; there are also pairs of opposing \"lazy lines\" in the field and one pair in each border; Z spun, unplied; 2 and 3 shoots of yellow weft after each row of knots with 3 at the junctions of the \"lazy lines\"; 8 knots per inch (29 per dm).\n\nPile: wool; 8 colours: red, yellow, blue, light blue, pink, brown (corroded), black (corroded), white; symmetrical knot tied around 2 threads; 65 knots per sq. inch (870 per sq. dm).\n\nSide finish: incomplete; web of 4 cords in yellow on wool on right and web of 3 on left.\n\nEnd finish: missing.",
