The theme park opened as the Circus World Showcase in February 1974 as a museum to document the history of the circus industry and later became Ringling Brothers Barnum & Bailey Circus, Circus World, sharing that name with the Circus World Museum in Baraboo, Wisconsin, possibly because their former director, C. P. 'Chappie' Fox was nominally in charge of the theme park.  The tray probably dates from about 1974, since the park opened then and the collection was acquired in 1976. \n\nThe images on the tray reproduce an engraving of Mlle Elena, a 19th century equestrienne, and portraits of the directors of the Ringling and Barnum & Bailety Brothers Circus.",
