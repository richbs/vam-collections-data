The 2 rectangular panels on a brick and timber wall covered nearly all one side of a room.  The panels have broad borders of fruit and flowers.  One shows 2 female figures offering a vase to a third; a smaller panel shows 2 embracing female figures.  He dates them late 17th century.  Condition varies; there are numerous cracks and the plaster is very thin (1/4\" at some places).  Thorpe recommends acceptance of a portion showing an owl and fruits if it is not possible to remove the whole intact.  Fragility of removal is outlined and in situ photographs are recommended.\n25 October 1937 Hay letter to Edwards\nexplains the difficulty of preserving the fragment \"in situ\".\n25 October 1937 memo Thorpe to Edwards\nreports that demolition of the right hand (window) end of the wall with the larger figured panel will soon begin.  Hay has requested a portion of the fruit border be removed for retention at Hill Hall and Thorpe has agreed to this (later correspondence in 1938 confirms that a specimen was preserved and sent from the V & A to Hill Hall) and to sending photographs of the plaster to Hay.\n6 November 1937 letter Edwards to Hay\nthanking him for the panels and expressing appreciation of the satisfactory removal of the decoration.\n12 November 1937 Edwards Minute paper\nreports that four specimens of the painted decoration are now in the Museum.  Considering the formidable difficulties they have been \"got out in excellent condition\".  He describes the decoration as \"of most exceptional character\", without parallel example.  He finds it reminiscent of (tapestry design?) and \"though the figures are Italianate\u2026\u2026there can be no doubt\u2026that it is by an English hand\".\n13 November 1937 Maclagan memo to Edwards\nstates he was \"struck by the beauty of these painted panels\" and suggests sending photos to Hind at the British Museum as he might trace the engravings from which the designs were taken or asking Laver to see if they bear any relation to the series of Raphael designs for the story of Psyche engraved by the Master at the Die.\nFurther correspondence\nrelates to the skill of the removal by Mr Crack and to the transport of a 2' x 3' specimen piece to Lord Hay.  The piece is eventually handed over on 29 November 1938.\n1953 Minute paper\nlists museum photographs of Venus at toilet and Venus giving gifts that are to be mounted as part of the labels near the Hill Hall plaster.",
