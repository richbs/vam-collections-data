Amorini suspend its festal garlands and light the flame of its thoughts, or play with the masks of grief and gladness, overhung by the bow and quiver of Love, and crowned with his roses. Pride and splendour as of the peacock lodge in its boughs, and the craft of the serpent is ruled over by the benign wings of the dove, while the corn is ever in the sickle, and the cornucopia is full of fruit.' (Description of the design by the artist, in <i>Building News</i> (1879), XXXVI, p 198.) This, with the frieze (no 832) and dado (no 834), was exhibited at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1878, where it received the Gold Medal Award.
