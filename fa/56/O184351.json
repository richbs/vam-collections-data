            "public_access_description": "This sequinned, pink chiffon dress was worn by Sandie Shaw for her performance at the Royal Variety Show, November 13th, 1967. The under-dress is constructed of brilliant pink silk, embroidered with huge multicoloured sequin roundels. These are repeated on the toning chiffon overdress and sleeves. \n\nSandie Shaw was an icon of 1960s pop music, known for performing in her bare feet and mini dresses. She was discovered by British pop singer Adam Faith (1940-2003) when she performed at a concert with him after coming second place in a talent contest. Throughout the 1960s she had many chart hits, including the No. 1 single and 1967 Eurovision Song Contest winner, Puppet on a String. Her career faltered as an attempt for musical credibility, with an album featuring covers of songs by artists such as Bob Dylan and The Rolling Stones, disassociated her from her fanbase. Despite occasional acting jobs and single releases, it was not until the early 1980s that she entered the public consciousness once more, with the help of Morrissey and Johnny Marr of The Smiths. With their encouragement she wrote and recorded her own songs, covered The Smiths' Hand in Glove, and released an album on the independent Rough Trade record label; it would be the first album she released that felt personal to her, having written a good deal of the material. \nShaw has since started a career as a psychotherapist, and opened The Arts Clinic in 1997, to provide psychological healthcare and creative development to those in the entertainment and media industries.\n\nThe Royal Variety Performance began in 1912 in London's West End, attended by King George V and Queen Mary, to raise money for the Variety Artistes' Benevolent Fund, becoming an annual event from 1921 and televised from the 1950s. Showcasing a variety of family entertainment, including comedy, singing, dance and magic, the 1967 production received the highest television audience in British history, with over 22.5 million people watching.",
