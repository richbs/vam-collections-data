The point of the blade is blunted.\n\nThe swept hilt guard is of twisted and chiseled steel, the crossguard with slender recurved quillons terminating in baluster like knobs. Finger loops and an outer and inner ring guard protect the index and forefingers of the Italian-style grip. The spiral decoration on the two ring guards are interrupted by a central moulding. Three curved guards sweep round forming an open cage around the hand and connect to a knuckle guard with a sharply hooked terminal.\n\nThe grip is spirally fluted and bound with tightly wrapped twisted wire. The pommel is an elongated dome shape decorated with spiral fluting and terminating in a small knob.",

The mark probably identifies the maker as the German bladesmith Samuel Hoppe S\u00f6hne, later Samuel Hoppe & Company, founded in 1840 as a general cutlers. Hoppe made swords prior to the Franco-Prussian War of 1871 with many of his swords being supplied to the state army of Bavaria. His British agent was Frederick Haste, 34 Jewin St. in the City of London at the beginning of the 1860s. He probably went out of business in the 1880s.\n\nIt is a reproduction of a C16th or C17th century original which may have made for ceremonial use. The tip of the blade is blunted, possible when the rapier was first used as a theatrical property.",
