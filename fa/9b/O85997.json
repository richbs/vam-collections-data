The inspiration for this piece may have been a type of Chinese night light.\n\nIn the Safavid period (1501-1722) Iranian potters made ceramics in the style of Chinese blue-and-white porcelain. Some of the Iranian wares were close imitations of Chinese originals and even had copies of Chinese maker\u2019s marks on the base. Other items were obviously inspired by Chinese pottery but have a shape or decoration that is typically Iranian. They include the bases of water-pipes, such as this piece.",
