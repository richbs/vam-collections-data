Posset and syllabub, the latter more often served chilled, being a sweetened foamy drink of milk curdled with wine or verjuice. The foam was eaten with a spoon and the liquid was sipped from the spout. The handles suggest that it was a communal cup. \n\nSafavid potters produced the form in white, monochrome and painted versions in lustre or blue. They may have been made for export or enjoyed by local English merchants, working for the East India or The Levant Company. However, the form is also known in Seljuk ceramics from the 12th century, and it may have been a revival of the form for a different purpose.",
