He is most famous for his publication of Actes and Monuments of these latter and perilous times touching matters of the Church, first printed in Latin in 1559, which became known as Foxe's Book of Martyrs. In it Foxe presented a history of the Church, focusing on the Church in England and giving an account of the martyrs to the Protestant cause. His aim in writing this book was to prove that Protestantism was the true faith.The work was initially criticised but went into four editions in Foxe's lifetime. Copies were kept in cathedrals and churches so that the public could read them. This print is a frontispiece (illustration facing the title-page of a book or one of its divisions) to a later edition of the book.\n\nThis likeness of John Foxe was probably copied from an original painting by an unidentified artist which is in the National Portrait Gallery, London.",
