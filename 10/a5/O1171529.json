This design made in the 1770s or 1780s by Joseph Nollekens (1737-1823) is for a wall monument. The only known monument by Nollekens of this pattern is in St. George's Cathedral, Barbados, to the Hon. Richard Salter, senator and magistrate in Barbados who died in 1776. The monument is signed but not dated, and it follows this design closely.\n\nNollekens is best known as the leading portrait sculptor in Britain between 1770 and 1815. With his fellow Royal Academicians Thomas Banks and John Flaxman he established the British School of sculpture following decades of dependence on immigrant sculptors (such as Rysbrack, Scheemakers and Roubiliac). Flaxman praised Nollekens as the only sculptor before Banks who had \"formed his taste on the antique and introduced a purer style of art\". Opportunities to study the antique were plentiful whilst Nollekens lived for eight years from 1762-1770 in Rome. As a draughtsman he was exceptionally well trained for his day.",
