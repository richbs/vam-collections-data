The form developed from medieval wooden drinking vessels, and the staves and the binding hoops of a barrel were often adapted as the decoration of tankards. Most examples have a flat base supported on either three small feet or a skirt foot (as is the case with this example) to raise the bottom of the vessel from the table. The front of this tankard is engraved with a coat of arms, between sprays of flowers.\n\nSheffield plate originated, with the discovery in 1742, that bars of silver and copper, in unequal proportions, fused by heating under pressure, could be rolled into sheets of laminated metal and worked like silver. The industry this material created flourished for about 100 years until superseded by electroplating in the 1840s.",
