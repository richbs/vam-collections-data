He described the subject of his painting as 'Ladies and animals...in various relations to each other'.  The three panels on the front show ladies feeding pigs, parrot and fishes. \n\nBurne-Jones had begun painting furniture a few years earlier when he shared a studio in Red Lion Square, London, with the designer William Morris.  They were influenced by medieval furniture which was plain and strongly-built, but with a surface decoration of painting.",

Rooke's watercolour of 1898 (private collection). The sideboard was given to the Museum in 1953 by Margaret Mackail, daughter of Edward and Georgiana.\n\nIn 1971 this cabinet was on display in the Green Dining Room, originally decorated by Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co. in 1866.",
