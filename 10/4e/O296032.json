Most European cultures disapproved of male jewellery, but buttons allowed men to show off their wealth and status.  They wore them in extravagant numbers, on sleeves and trousers as well as jackets and waistcoats.  The most popular kinds, throughout the region, were round filigree buttons, which varied in design and details of construction from place to place.  \n\nThis button was described as 18th century Dutch when it was acquired by the Museum in 1891.  At that time, antique Dutch silver of all kinds was immensely popular in Britain, and buttons were often described as antique Dutch when they were neither old nor Dutch.  This button was probably made around 1800, and may be Dutch, but is more likely to have come from the area around Hamburg in Germany, probably from the Probstei.",
