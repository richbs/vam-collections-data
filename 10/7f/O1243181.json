Barnor\u2019s photograph of the BBC\u2019s first black broadcaster, Mike Eghan, on the steps of the landmark Piccadilly Circus fountain cements the emergence of a black cultural presence in Britain. This confident arrival is combined with a backdrop of neon advertising, which had made a lasting impression on Barnor since he first moved to London in 1959.\n\nThe V&amp;A acquired five photographs by James Barnor as part of the Staying Power project. Staying Power is a five year partnership between the V&amp;A and Black Cultural Archives. The project aims to explore black British experience from the 1950s to the 1990s through photographs acquired by the V&amp;A and oral histories conducted by Black Cultural Archives.",
