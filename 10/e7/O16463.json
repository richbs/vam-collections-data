Clearly the 'Virgin and Child' archetype stands behind his repeated versions of mother and baby. To some extent the role of mother is idealized, but at the same time Cope shows a real insight into the tender bond between mother and baby. This is a good example of his ability to capture the intimacy of a private moment, and the young mother's happiness.",

Briefly at school in London, then Leeds Grammar School. Returned to London 1827 to study at Sass's art school and 1828 at RA Schools. Travelled to Paris 1832 and Italy 1833-5. Exhibited 134 works at the RA between 1833 and 1882, 14 at the BI 1836--43, and one at the SBA 1837. Nearly all his paintings were literary, biblical or historical subjects and domestic genre; the fact that he was Roman Catholic may explain his choice of many of the subjects. Founder member of the Etching Club in about 1840. Awarded one of the three first prizes in the 1843 competition for the new Palace of Westminster decorations with 'An Early Trial by Jury'; travelled again to Italy to study fresco painting before painting several frescos at Westminster. Elected ARA 1843, RA 1848; appointed Professor of Painting at the RA 1867, and examiner in painting for the South Kensington Schools of Art 1870. Visited America and Canada 1876. Died Bournemouth, Hampshire, 21 August 1890. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1869, ppl77-9; CH Cope <i>Reminiscences of Charles West Cope</i> RA 1891 (referred to below as <i>Reminiscences</i>) \n\n<b>Mother and Child</b> \nFA60 Neg 59104 \nCanvas, on a gesso ground, 36.2 x 25.4 cm (14\u00bc x 10 ins) \nSigned and dated 'C W Cope 1852' bl \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nAccording to the <i>Reminiscences</i>, exhibited at the RA in 1853, where it was hung in the left-hand corner of the large room, and bought by John Sheepshanks. The <i>Art Journal</i> critic called it 'simple, substantial, and worked out with scrupulous nicety'. \n\nThe picture was lined in an unfinished state, turning the greys brown-green, so they had to be repainted. \n\nEXH: RA 1853 (80); <i>Exposition Universelle</i> Paris 1855 (769 or 770, both 'Une Mere et Son Enfant', lent by J Sheepshanks)\n \nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1853, p143; <i>Reminiscences</i> pp202, 381\"",
