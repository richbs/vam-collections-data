During this period the wearing of extravagant displays of lace was increasingly used as a mark of wealth and status. The showiest effects were achieved with lace worn at the throat and at the wrist, setting off the face and hands, but a fashionable man might even have matching lace borders trimming his boot hose.\n\nMaterials & Making\nLace for collars and cuffs could be bought either by length or by the piece made to shape, and might be brought back in either form by English travellers returning from abroad. It was then usually taken to a milliner to be made up or at a later stage to be adapted into a newly fashionable style.\n\nTrading\nIn an attempt to protect the English lace industry a royal proclamation was issued in 1662 forbidding the importation or selling of foreign lace. The royal family was exempt from this prohibition, which also seems to have been widely flouted by members of the court and other fashionable people, for Venetian needle lace of this type continued to be freely sold and worn in London.",
