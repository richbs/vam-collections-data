The painting probably accurately shows how they were intended to be used.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe candlestick copies an ormolu (gilt bronze) one designed by the architect Sir William Chambers for a client. Chambers lent Josiah Wedgwood (1730-1795) a lead or carved-wood casting model of the candlestick, but Wedgwood had to have this remade for reproduction in pottery. In 1771 he wrote that 'the Griffin Candlestick is alter'd sure enough, for Hackwood [William Hackwood, one of Wedgwood's modellers] was oblig'd to new model it. I hope all the world will not have Mr Chambers's Eyes'. Wedgwood had problems firing the candlestick, complaining that 'the tips of the Griffins wings will not stick to the top of the head as ... in the Lead or Wood pattern', and that 'they all fly off' in the kiln.\n\nPeople\nSir William Chambers (1723-1796), the King's architect, was an important influence on the design of Wedgwood's ornamental wares. Not only did he did he lend Wedgwood models to copy, but he also advised him on matters of design.",
