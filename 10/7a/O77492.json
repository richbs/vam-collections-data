The image is a unique positive made directly onto the plate without a negative, as in other forms of photography. Many daguerreotype photographers replaced miniature painters as makers of portraits as the process was quicker and less expensive.\n\nOwnership & Use\nDaguerreotypes were not made primarily for public display in exhibitions. Such small and intimate photographs were generally produced as private keepsakes and often remained within the family.\n\nPeople\nHoratio Ross (1801-1886) took up photography in 1845, although he is also remembered as one of the 19th century's finest sportsmen. He was best known for steeplechasing (a form of horse racing) and as a marksman. Ross and his sons represented Scotland in the National Rifle Association championships in 1863.",
