Italian goldsmiths were expert at making a little material go a very long way.  They used thin sheet gold to make impressive pieces of jewellery, and decorated them with glass stones made to look like real gems.  \n\nRed was the most popular colour in traditional jewellery throughout Italy.  In the northern and central regions the jewellers usually decorated their jewellery with garnets, as here, often mixed with pearls.  This earring, which comes from Genoa, has white pastes, which were much less common, and may reflect Genoa\u2019s international outlook.  The setting of the garnets is also more elaborate than is usual in Italian traditional jewellery.\n\nIt was bought for 12 shillings (the pair) as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
