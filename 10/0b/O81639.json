This scene shows the actor John Liston in the title role, with Phyllis Glover as 'Phoebe', Madame Vestris as 'Eliza' and Mr Williams as 'Colonel Hardy'. The play was extremely popular in the 1800s. Paul Pry was Liston's most successful role, and Derby porcelain figures and Staffordshire pottery figures of him were produced.",

ISBN 1851771026\nParkinson, R., Victoria and Albert Museum, <u>Catalogue of British Oil Paintings 1820-1860</u>, London: HMSO, 1990, pp. 29-30\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\"CLINT, George ARA (1770-1854)\n\nBorn Brownlow Street, Drury Lane, London, 12 April 1770, son of a hairdresser. After school in Yorkshire, worked in turn for a fishmonger, attorney, housepainter, and bookseller. Trained first as a miniature painter; acquaintance with John Bell (see FA253, p31) and his nephew Edward Bell led him to produce mezzotints; also made coloured copies from prints after George Morland and others. First oil painting was a portrait of his wife, which resulted in an introduction to Sir William Beechey RA. Exhibited 99 works at the RA between 1802 and 1845, nine at the BI 1815-42, and 15 at the SBA 1831-47. Almost all were portraits, and after 1816 many were of actors and theatrical scenes in the tradition of Zoffany and Samuel de Wilde. His studio in Gower Street became a rendezvous for the leading actors and actresses of the day. Elected ARA 1821; repeated failure to be elected RA resulted in his resignation 1836. Died Kensington, London, 10 May 1854.\n \nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1854, pp212-3 (obit by his pupil R W Buss) \n\n<b>Scene from 'Paul Pry'</b> \nFA21 NegJl226 \nCanvas, 127 x 61 cm (50 x 24 ins) \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nExhibited at the RA in 1827 (not, as stated in previous V&A catalogues, in 1831) with the following title and quotation in the catalogue: \n\nScene from Mr Poole's Comedy of Paul Pry, with Portraits of Madame Vestris, Miss P Glover, Mr Williams, and Mr Liston \n<i>Phoebe</i>: No one shall enter this room. We stand here upon our honour; and, if you doubt my young lady's, what is to become of mine I should like to know? \n<i>Paul Pry</i>: I can't possibly say Mrs Phoebe; but I would advise you to look well after it, for, I protest - there he is \n\nThe quotation is from act 2 scene 2 of the comedy in three acts Paul Pry by John Poole (178617-1872), first produced 13 September 1825. The first performance with the players represented here was at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket, on 26 September 1825; Mr Williams took over the part originally played by William Farren. Miss P[hyllis] Glover (1807-31) was the daughter of the well-known actress Mrs Glover (see also FA20 above). Madame Vestris (1797-1856) played Phoebe, and John Liston (?1776-1846) the title role. \n\nThe play was extremely popular in the 19th century; Paul Pry was Liston's most successful role, and Derby porcelain figures and Staffordshire pottery figures of him were produced (exhibited in <i>The Georgian Playhouse</i> 1975), and that image may be the original of the Johnny Walker whisky label figure. A mezzotint engraving by Clint's pupil Thomas Lupton, published 1 July 1828, is lettered 'from the original picture in the possession of T Griffiths, Esq.' The <i>Art Journal</i> obituary of Clint records that 'For Mr Griffiths of Norwood, Clint commenced and painted many portraits for a theatrical gallery, viz., Munden, Grimaldy, Fawcett, Knight, Cooper, Liston ... ', some being later destroyed by a fire at Griffiths' house. The obituary also lists <i>Paul Pry</i> among the artist's principal works.\n \nThe chair, side table, and wall bracket, which may record the stage setting, have been identified by John Hardy as taken from designs by J A Meissonnier for furniture and interiors published in about 1745. \n\nPROV: ?painted for T Griffiths of Norwood in 1828; given to the museum by John Sheepshanks 1857 \n\nEXH: RA 1827 (222); <i>National Portraits</i> South Kensington Museum 1868\n(566) \n\nENGR: Mezzotint by Thomas Lupton, 1 July 1828 \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</I> 1854, pp212-3 (obit by his pupil R W Buss); G Ashton and I Mackintosh <i>The Georgian Playhouse</i>, Arts Council Hayward Gallery Exhibition catalogue 1975 (l7l, 178-188)\"",
