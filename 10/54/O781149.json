ISBN 089835000X. B.25, pp.70-72.\n'In the diary of his journey to the Low Countries, D\u00fcrer recorded that he gave away impressions of this print on 19 and 20 August 1520. He refers to the subject as \"Veronicam.\" Some commentators believe that the artist conceived it as the closing sheet of The Engraved Passion, however, the horizontal format, which D\u00fcrer used only on a few occasions, would seem to speak against this. The image of Christ has been regarded as a self-portrait. Its hypnotic eyes, looking directly at the beholder, have inspired many later artists, particularly H.S. Beham's large woodcut of Christ's face (see vol.10, no.26-27 [182]).\n\nThis engraving reflects the dual nature of the legend of St. Veronica. The earliest version (recorded in the sixth century) speaks of the cloth merely as a commemorative image of Christ commissioned by the saint. By 1300, in the influential Bible of Roger d'Argenteuil, the saint, taking pity on Jesus on his ay to Calvary, hands him the kercheif to wipe his face, and miraculously his features are imprinted on it. In 1216 Pope Innocent III composed an office for a relic of the Sudarium, preserved at St. Peter's, carrying ten days' indulgence. The fact that it could also be recited before replicas led to a proliferation of copies of the Sudarium, both painted and printed.'\n\np.70\nBartrum, Guilia, ed. <u>Albrecht D\u00fcrer and his Legacy - The Graphic Work of a Renaissance Artist</u> / with contributions by G\u00fcnter Grass, Joseph L.
