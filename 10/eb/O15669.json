This sophisticated and striking evening ensemble consists of a short, tailored bolero jacket and loose, straight trousers, both entirely covered with vertical rows of overlapping sequins. It was worn with a delicate lace and chiffon blouse which fastens with pearl buttons.\n\nIn adopting the trouser suit Chanel anticipated the direction that fashion would take in the 1960s and 1970s towards an androgynous look. However, the masculine lines of this outfit are tempered by the luxurious finish. Chanel said \u2018Much seriousness is required to achieve the frivolous.\u2019 \n\nThe outfit was worn by Diana Vreeland with a black ribbon around her neck into which she tucked a red rose. Diana worked for Harper's Bazaar for 27 years and became associate editor of Vogue magazine in January 1963. She soon became editor-in-chief and remained with Vogue until 1971. Her colleagues admired her originality and commitment to fashion. On leaving Vogue, she became adviser to the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.",
