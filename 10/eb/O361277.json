This consists of a series of narrow bands: two picks of red, four of white, two of blue, four of white and two of red. There are small four-petalled blossoms which are embroidered on the loom in alternating red and blue, then the narrow bands repeat. This three-fold combination repeats on the other side of a wider band which contains larger loom-embroidered blossoms, five red ones and five blue ones. Across the length of the towel bands of red cotton (two picks of red, four of white, two of red) repeat every four inches. At one end, above the main decorative band are initials, possibly EM or EP embroidered with mercerised cotton in a tight satin stitch.",
