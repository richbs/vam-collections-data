It features Mot\u00f6rhead's symbol \"war-pig\", or Snaggletooth, as designed by the heavy metal and science fiction artist Joe Petagno. Based on a combination of animal skulls, including a gorilla, wolf and dog, the mascot has appeared in some form on every album M\u00f6torhead released until 2007. \n\nThe British band Mot\u00f6rhead were formed in 1975 by bassist, singer and songwriter Lemmy. The formation of the band pre-empted the New Wave of British Heavy Metal in the late 1970s and early 80s, and by fusing punk rock into their genre they helped pioneer speed and thrash metal. Lemmy has stated, however, that he feels more kinship with punk bands such as The Damned, saying in interview that \"This term \"heavy metal\" is only rock 'n' roll anyway, because metal bands are the logical successors to Eddie Cochran and Buddy Holly\".",
