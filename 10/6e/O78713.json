The model and a quantity of the plating metal (usually silver) are then connected to electric terminals and placed in a bath filled with a conductive solution. The electrical current  causes particles of the plating metal to be deposited on the surface of the model. The thickness of the plating can be regulated by the duration and voltage of the current. The plated object is then worked manually to erase imperfections. A difference in the quality of surface can be detected in unburnished pieces, and clarity of line is sometimes lost.\n\nTime\nThe extensive scheme for reproducing electrotype copies of metal objects was undertaken by the Science and Art Department in the latter half of the 19th century. Sir Henry Cole, the first Director of the South Kensington Museum (now the V&A), quickly grasped the educational potential of this new technique.",
