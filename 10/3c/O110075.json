Speaks French with a Flemish accent./ The mechanic Robert Lelong [photo beside]/ born at Ormeignies, on 5 May 1919/ Description:/ Height: 1 m 70 cm; svelte, slim build, tanned complexion, hair combed with a side parting on the left, narrow little moustache./ Frenchmen! A pressing call to help the police find the guilty parties also concerns you - even more so because these murders were considered patriotic acts. The murderers are not patriots but criminals, who, moved by terrorist politics, committed these crimes for the pleasure of the kill for base motives and the love of money. They stole, on this occasion, money and jewels. Any decent Frenchman would recoil in horror at such acts where hostages were taken. \nInformation about the whereabouts of the guilty can be communicated at all French & German police offices.\nAll leads will be treated confidentially. A reward of 10, 000 RM will be offered for information leading to their arrest. May we draw your attention specifically to the fact that any person, who upon reading this notice, gives refuge to the guilty or otherwise comes to their aid - in whatever capacity - will face the severest of penalties./ von Falkenhausen, General of the Infantry in Belgium & Northern France.",

It serves as a bi-lingual warrant for the apprehension of two men suspected of killing two German security police officers. It is printed in French and German for display throughout the territories Germany occupied during World War II. The notice's menacing subtext is that anyone who does not co-operate fully with the German authorities will also be treated as a criminal.\n\nThe poster was issued by Infantry General von Stulpnagel & von Falkenhausen, General of the Infantry in Belgium & Northern France.",
