It was made from a blind-stamped impression which is a print made by a form of relief printing. The design is impressed into the paper blind, that is un-inked. In this case, the metalwork notebook case was the printing block.  The blind-stamped impression of its raised border is handcoloured in watercolour. \n\nThe design bears an inscription that states it was made for the Queen of Naples on the 25th of February 1788.  She was Marie-Caroline of Hapsburg-Lorraine, sister of Marie-Antoinette and wife of Ferdinand IV of Bourbon of the two Sicilies. It is from an album of designs which date from about 1735-1820 and includes those for snuffboxes, scent holders, watches and watch cases, spoons, fans and fan mounts, small swords, and chatelaines (ornamental chains, pins, or clasps usually worn at a woman's waist, to which trinkets, keys, purses, or other articles are attached).\n\nThere is a close relationship between the contents of the album and known work by three Parisian goldsmiths, Jean Ducrollay (1710-1787), Pierre- Fran\u00e7ois Drais (active 1761-1788), and Charles Ouizille (1744-1830) whose names appear on the first page of the album. This suggests that all the designs emanate from their workshops.  Drais worked for the Court at Versailles as jeweller to both King Louis XV and Louis XVI. Ouizille worked in this capacity for Louis XVI. Most of the material dates from the period 1755-90.",
