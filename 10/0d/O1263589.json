The clusters hang from a chain of patinated silver cylindrical beads of different shades and dimensions, each individually distorted and ridged. At thee points a crumpled cylindrical bead protrudes at right angles to the others, and there is a similar protrusion from the end of the largest pearl-covered cluster. The cylindrical beads adjacent to the clusters are decorated with a small number of nylon-tipped pearls. The whole is threaded on two narrow twisted wires.",

He is based in the jewellery-making city of Pforzheim where he took a traditional apprenticeship followed by a diploma in Design. \n\nIn this necklace he brings together the simple, time-honoured jewellery materials of silver and freshwater pearls with radical and beautiful results. Pearls are usually regarded as objects of beauty in their own right and worn very simply, but in this necklace they become a means to achieve a very different effect. The pearls appear to grow out of the blackened, bulbous forms beneath, softening them and echoing various natural forms but particularly the frost which gives the name to his \u201cfrozen\u201d series of jewels to which this necklace belongs.",
