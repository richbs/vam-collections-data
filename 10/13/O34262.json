ISBN 1851773088.\nOriginally applied to an ecclesiastical vestment, this roundel with the figure of an unidentified king is an example of a type of embroidery that was already identified as distinctively English in the Middle Ages through its description in inventories such as opus anglicanum (English work). Although its English origins were never in doubt, the roundel was among a large number of medieval textile fragments acquired in the 1860s, not as examples of English material, but as part of the wider context of European medieval art. The tiny fragment was acquired from Dr. Franz Bock who, though a canon of Aachen cathedral, was very active as a dealer. Bock's scholarly investigation of medieval cathedral treasuries in Germany and Austria resulted in substantial publication, including a history of textiles, but it also seems to have involved the removal of numerous sample specimens (such as this) snipped from complete vestments. The collection of textiles assembled in this way was sold by Bock (who was on very good terms with J. C. Robinson) to South Kensington; in addition, the applied arts museums in Vienna and Berlin, as well as South Kensington, continued to buy other works from him. By the 1920s, however, such textiles were being seen in terms of their national significance, a position reinforced by the publication in 1938 of A. G. I. Christie's monumental study, English Medieval Embroidery. This shift was also reflected in publications on other aspects of medieval art by scholars associated with the Museum, including Mary Chamot's English Medieval Enamels (1930) and Margaret Longhurst's English Ivories (1926), with its most notable manifestation the major exhibition, \"English Medieval Art,\" mounted by the Museum in 1930.\n\nLit.
