More than one version were produced for purchase (three are in the Royal Collection at Windsor Castle); these would have been framed and hung on walls, or perhaps kept in cabinets with other wax portraits. It is not dated, and may well be a posthumous portrait. Frederick was the son of George II, and the father of George III, who ascended the throne in 1760.\n\nPeople\nIsaac Gosset was a member of a French Huguenot family who settled in St Helier, Jersey, and later in London. He was taught by his uncle, Matthew Gosset, and was the last member of his family to model in wax. His connections led to a number of prestigious commissions, as a contemporary, George Vertue, noted: Gosset 'has had the Honour of his Majestyes setting to him ... haveing done the kings portrait in wax. extreamly like him, and the late Prince of Wales'. Gosset was intimately acquainted with the painter Thomas Gainsborough (1727-1788), and regularly exhibited in London. His family were also picture-framers, a skill Gosset practised himself.\n\nMaterials & Making\nWax portraits were particularly popular in Britain in the second half of the 18th century. They were often modelled from the life; a mould could be made from this initial model, from which further copies could be cast. The waxes were small and portable, and the nature of the material meant that they were extremely naturalistic. Sometimes they were coloured, and extra items added, such as textiles, seed pearls or coloured glass, to increase the lifelike appearance of the portrayal.",
