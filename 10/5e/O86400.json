            "physical_description": "Painting, in opaque watercolour on paper, a lady  in profile facing left holding up a white flower in her right hand stands on green grass in the foreground with a landscape behind her. She is dressed in a diaphanous white <i>peshwaz</i>overdress with an edging of gold-tipped lappets either side of the open neck which falls between her breasts that are visible beneath the fine material.  The dress falls to her feet with a gold edge down the central opening and along the hem.  She wears white <i>paijama</i> decorated with crimson roses alternating with a leaf motif on a gold-spotted ground. In the centre a golden <i>patka</i> falls from her waistband to her feet and is ornately decorated with a floral pattern.  She wears a pair of crimson slippers patterned in gold.  She is richly bejewelled in pearls and gemstones and gold bangles.  Over her loose hair and crossed over her chest she wears a transparent orange <i>odhani</i> (veil) edged in gold, one end of which she holds in her left hand.\n  The minute details of the landscape behind her are barely discernible, but  a stretch of water with boats lies behind her, beyond which a group of travellers including a rider on horseback, a camel and a covered ox cart among other smaller figures move towards the left-hand edge of the image. On the horizon a group of buildings with a minaret is painted in outline nestling on a hill among trees to the left while a smaller group of buildings is faintly sketched in on the horizon to the right .  The landscape and sky above are painted  in a turquoise green ground colour with white streaks in the sky melding into gold,  purple and blue at the top of the painting.\n  The painting has been extended by a strip just over a centimetre in depth at the lower edge and painted in a grassy green wash with a pink flowering plant.  This is painted in a relatively crude fashion  in comparison with the delicately painted flowers and grasses of the original above.\n  The painting is framed with a faded pinky-brown inner border outlined in white on both sides with a golden scrolling pattern of bell-shaped flowers. This is edged in a gold line outlined with thin black lines and an outer line in blue.  The ivory-coloured outer border to the page is decorated with a row of alternate pink lilies and red poppies outlined in gold.  The page has blue margins made of collaged strips of paper outlined with a white line on three sides and an additional strip of grey paper on the left hand side which acts as a gutter for the album binding",
