The suggestion of side hoops and the double box-pleats at the back echo 18th century fashion. The design subverts the sack-back style seen in Watteau\u2019s paintings, yet the gown\u2019s deliberate asymmetry, with a single off-shoulder style and a polonaise pouf on only one side, gives it a thoroughly contemporary look. A white organdie version of this dress was designed for Lady Bianca Job-Tyroan in 1994 for the Queen Charlotte\u2019s Ball. Westwood often subverts historical references in her designs, which has led her to continually produce innovative and original clothing since her first collections in the mid-1970s.",
