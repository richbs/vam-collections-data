Sometimes a well-known fashion designer supplies dresses for the stars of a contemporary production; in the 19th century, long before the fashion shows and cat-walk, this was a good way of advertising and ensuring that their creations were seen by a wide audience.  The practice continued into the 20th century, and this example was supplied by the great French couturier Paquin for the actress Cecily Byrne as Hetty Temple in Dorothy Massingham's play Not in Our Stars in 1924.  \nThis dress would have been selected from Paquin's current fashion portfolio, not 'designed' specifically for the play and the particular character.   It is a deceptively plain 1920s dress, gathered on the hips, its simplicity offset by the complex decorative motifs through which the belt passes and with which it is trimmed. Byrne was the only member of the cast dressed by Paquin; the other costumes were designed by Elspeth Phelps.",
