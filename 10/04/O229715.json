Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. Above all, they had to have the means for attaching a cord. Netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated being the katabori (shape carving), a three-dimensional carving, such as this one in the form of a Dutchman holding a cockerel.\n\nPeople, whether real, imaginary or historical, provided a rich source of inspiration for netsuke carvers. Of particular appeal during the eighteenth century were depictions of foreign merchants. The Dutch and the Chinese, since 1639, were the only foreigners allowed to trade in Japanese waters and were confined to trade on two coastal settlements on the southern island of Kyushu, away from the mainland. The Orandajin or Hollanders were of particular interest and were carved, as within this example, with large noses and wearing their native clothing.",
