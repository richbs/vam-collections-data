They usually wore them on a black velvet ribbon, fastened tightly round the neck like a choker, with a slide at the front.  The ribbon passes through the bale of the cross, and is then threaded through a hole or loop at the base of the slide, and out at either side.  It is tied in a bow at the back of the neck.\n\nNormandy has the greatest variety of crosses, some so elaborate as to be almost unrecognisable.  The croix bosse is made from two thin sheets of metal, stamped in a mould to produce the characteristic bosses, soldered together round the edge.  It is one of the earliest of the Normandy crosses.  The design dates from the 18th century, as shown by the stylised fleur de lys at the top, when it was worn throughout France.  By the 19th century it was only worn in Normandy.  It was always worn with a heart-shaped slide, decorated with filigree tracery.\n\nCroix bosses were made of gold, silver, or gilt metal.  The pattern of the decoration, like faceted stones, and the flexible lower part, caught the light and flashed enticingly as the wearer moved.",
