Chen's books invariably come within some kind of box or case, 'the fact that the reader is presented with a package that can be opened in order to get to the book is a very deliberate choice on my part.' Chen wants the revealing of the book to be part of the overall interactive experience. The opening of this particular box reveals a tunnel book with layered, die cut pages in shades of green and blue, attached to two accordion folded leaves. The lines of the poem run along the wave-shaped edges of the cut out pages, descending to a watery conclusion. When the book is fully extended the depths of the sea are evoked via the increasingly dark, ocean-hued ink until the pages ultimately become entwined with the tentacles of the octopus of the title, lurking in the very depths of the book.",
