The apex of the arch is marked by two large tulip-like heads in similar colours.  In the arch, on a cream ground, is a painted inscription and block-printed cartouche with a smaller inscription.\nBands [4], [3] and [1] are repeated.\nThere is a less deep section with a red ground and a cream cartouche and painted inscription.\nThis arrangement of bands [4], [3] and [1] and a section with an inscription is repeated, giving seven in total, followed by a repetition of bands [4], [3] and [1].\nAt the bottom there is [5] a band with a repeating pattern of arches in blue with red spandrels and isolated flower heads in 8 variations followed by a repetition of band [2], a mirror image of band [5] and finally a repetition of band [1].\nCanvas patches have been attached to the upper corners at the back to strengthen them for hanging; there is one loop at the right hand corner.",
