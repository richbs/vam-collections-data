It was registered in the London street directories at 77, South Audley Street, London W1 for the years 1948-1949. Around her neck, a long ribbon embroidered with pearls is slotted through from the back to the front. To both sides of the drawing, the designer noted, in pencil, the fabrics and colours out of which the dress was intended to be made and special features of the design.\n\nThis design was in a folder marked 'Marjorie Field Rhoades' and 'Matita'.
