This velvet is particularly complex because it comprises different forms of pile and incorporates metallic threads. It conforms to the usual widths of the period for such textiles (54-60 centimetres).\n\nIn Western Europe, expertise in velvet-weaving was restricted at this period to various Italian cities (e.g. Lucca, Florence, Genoa, Venice) and to certain centres in Spain, some of which had gained their knowledge through the import of Italian craftsmen (e.g. Valencia). The first records of velvet production in Lucca, Venice, Florence, and Genoa date to the beginning of the fourteenth century, as do the first records of their presence in royal and papal inventories. While Lucca was the earliest centre, the other three cities competed for leadership in the fifteenth and sixteenth century. \n\nNot surprisingly, velvet weavers earned more than their confreres who specialised in other silk textiles, and their earnings increased in direct proportion to the difficulty of the work involved: in the velvet hierarchy, at the bottom sat the weavers of solid velvets, at the top the weavers of pile-on-pile velvets with brocading and boucl\u00e9 gold wefts. The former earned about one third of the wages of the latter.\n\nIn the sixteenth century sumptuary laws attempted - unsuccessfully - to reduce excessive expenditure on clothing and furnishings, restricting the use of such textiles in dress and forbidding it in canopies, blankets, curtains, and cushions.\n\nFor further detail, see Roberta Orsi Landini.
