Made of black silk satin decorated with appliqu\u00e9 silk and couched silver-gilt thread, with some gilt paper strip and coloured silks in laid work. In the centre of the main part of the frontal is a circular disk surrounded by clouds and gold discs, containing a pagoda from which spring rays and around which are clouds, birds and symbols. Above the central disc are three symbols with the imperial sun and moon symbols. The rest of the field occupied by cranes, pagodas, symbols and ovoid groups of clouds on a diapered ground. This area has been mounted upside down as a frontal. It is edged along three sides with green, cream and purple ribbon and black satin, and backed with blue cotton. At the top is a valance depicting waves, fish, dragons, mythical creatures, birds, the attributes of the eight Taoist Immortals and some of the eight precious things, all against a diapered background. A small piece cut from the same piece of embroidery as the main part of the robe has been left in at the centre. Edged with ribbon and black satin. The frontal supplied with blue loops and red cords for hanging purposes.",
