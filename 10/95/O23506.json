The motifs appear dark against a paler ground because they are formed by the dense, cut pile of the velvet. It is fastened with fabric knot buttons which pass through loops. Inside the robe, at the top of the section hidden beneath the overlap, there is a patch pocket of matching velvet. This is a 20th-century feature, copied from Western tailoring.",
