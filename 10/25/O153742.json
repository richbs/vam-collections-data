Dark brown ground with a repeating design of off-set blue and faded pink octagons containing 8-pointed stars in very faded pink or light blue, and with elongated hexagons in between. The border varies from pink to red with S-motifs in white or light blue. Some of the outlines of the S motifs have been renewed and this has turned them into elongated hexagons. This renewed stitching has gone through the interlining. There are some minor repairs using olive green and red silk.\n\nEmbroidery threads: 2S silk; black, dark brown, white, yellow, light blue, blue, pink (faded from red), light brown (faded from red).\nBacking: printed cotton: light green ground with off-set isolated floral sprigs in white and beige.\nFacing: blue silk satin with pink selvedges.",
