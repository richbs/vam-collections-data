We have to annihilate the Germans and kill a necessary number of them. We cannot kill enough of them, in order to win.\"\nWe will remember that well. Mainly we will not forget the cowardly and malicious attacks of the British pilots on the defenceless children and civilians, which Minister Cooper was probably referring to in his bloodthirsty speech.\nBecause in view of the courageous British retreats in Norway and France, Minister Cooper will hardly reach his goal in an honest fight on the battle field.

This poster was issued to rally the German public in reprisals against the British and American forces. The text references British government minister Duff Cooper, who is quoted as seeking to kill the German people. It also sarcastically refers to so-called \"courageous\" British troops who retreated from battle. German propaganda's aim was to unify all Germans against perceived threats from enemies who are here described as \"cowardly,\" \"malicious\" and \"bloodthirsty.\" This is particularly effective by adding details which appeal to emotion such as air attacks on \"defenceless\" German children and civilians. The tragic irony in propaganda such as this is that Axis forces - here threatened by speeches about German annihilation - committed these same atrocities during the Holocaust.",
