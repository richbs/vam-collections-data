            "public_access_description": "Hot-water jugs were essential for making and serving tea.  For much of the 18th century tea was relatively expensive. The thrifty hostess refreshed the existing brew with hot water rather than making a fresh one.  By the latter part of the 18th century, people often bought tea services piecemeal.\n\nPeople liked faceted or fluted vessels, such as this hot-water pot, because of their classical style. Sheffield plate vessels in this style had disadvantages. The material was a fusion of copper and silver. The ridges were particularly prone to wear, which rubbed off the silver and exposed the copper core. The growing number of Neo-classical designs for Sheffield plate led to the decline of the metal (style?). The platers had difficulties transferring silversmithing techniques such as casting and engraving to Sheffield plate. Techniques such as chasing and machine stamping became more common. They replaced engraving directly onto the surface of a plated vessel, which ran the risk of exposing the underlying copper. \n\nThomas Boulsover, a Sheffield cutler, discovered Sheffield plate in about 1742. He found that copper and silver fused in unequal amounts expanded together at uniform rate under mechanical pressure. Sheffield plate revolutionised the plating industry. It offered a relatively inexpensive, versatile and durable plating technique that could imitate solid silver.",
