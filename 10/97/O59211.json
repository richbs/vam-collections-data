It was designed by Filippo Pelagio Palagi (1775-1860), Italy\u2019s leading decorator during the period 1825-1850. Palagi undertook all aspects of interior design, from murals to curtain pelmets. He employed a wide range of craftsmen. Among them was Gabrielle Cappello (1806-1876), known as \u2018Moncalvo\u2019, who made this marquetry chair.\n\nPalagi completed his work at Racconigi by 1845. But his patron, Carlo Alberto I of Sardinia (reigned 1831-1849), enjoyed it for only a few years. The king abdicated in 1849, after a crushing defeat by the Austrians at Novara. He died in exile in Portugal a few months later.",

This created an extremely smooth surface, which played on the contrasts between light and dark woods, and allowed particularly rapid execution.",
