Zhu An.\n\nEncasing a stoneware ewer or cup in pewter was a novel way of production introduced in the early 19th century. Due to the high content of lead (about 50%) Chinese pewter is very soft, making it a suitable material on which a scholar could easily exercise his carving knife.\n  \nAccording to the Zhouli (Rites of Zhou) the wu ji (five grades of wines) and san jiu (three types of alcohol) were to be consumed for different purposes and on different occasions. By the 19th century these rules were no longer observed. The owner of the cup made this reference to show that he was well versed in the classics. \n\nAlthough most Yixing wares were made for tea-drinking the inscription on the present cup indicates that it is a wine cup.",
