The metal thread is silver strip close S-wound on a deep yellow silk core.  The effect created is a series of short vertical bands of blue satin.  Each band has a pair of small leaves and a large flowerhead to either side of it and a V-shaped stem with leaves and flowerheads below it and, inverted, above it.  Small tendrils link these elements to form a series of faint diamonds across the ground.\nIn the upper 4.5 cm of this piece the patterned is 'squashed' and there is a line without any weft interlacing with the warp, so this may indicate the end of a loom piece.\nBacking: white ground printed with stems which bear composite blossoms in red, blue and yellow with green leaves. The stems seem to go in random directions to fill the ground.\nFacing: bias cut blue cotton.",
