Overall size 44.5 x 29 cm\n1597\n<i>The grammar of ornament</i> consists of 100 lithographic plates, produced by Day and Son, illustrating twenty chapters which discuss ornament produced by various cultures and epochs, while the final chapter looks at 'Leaves and flowers from nature'. In the introduction Owen Jones states that his aim was to establish:\n\n<sup>'First. That whenever any style of ornament commands universal admiration, it will always be found to be in accordance with the laws which regulate the distribution of form in nature.\n   Secondly. That however varied the manifestations in accordance with these laws, the leading ideas on which they are based are few.\n   Thirdly. That the modifications and developments which have taken place from one style to another have been caused by a sudden throwing off of some fixed trammel, which set thought free for a time, till the new idea, like the old, became again fixed, to give birth in its turn to fresh inventions.\n   Lastly. I have endeavoured to show ... that the future progress of Ornamental Art may be best secured by engrafting on the experience of the past the knowledge we may obtain by a return to Nature for fresh inspiration. To attempt to build up theories of art, or to form a style independently of the past would be an act of extreme folly. It would be at once to reject the experiences and accumulated knowledge of thousands of years. On the contrary, we should regard as our inheritance all the successful labours of the past, not blindly following them, but employing them simply as guides to find the true path.'</sup>\n\nOf this particular Pompeian plate he wrote: 'The ornaments for the pilasters and friezes ... after the Roman type, are shaded to give rotundity, but not sufficiently so to detach them from the ground. In this the Pompeian artists showed a judgment in no exceeding that limit of the treatment of the ornament in the round, altogether lost sight of in subsequent times. We have the acanthus-leaf scroll forming the ground work, on which are engrafted representations of leaves and flowers interlaced with animals, precisely similar to the remains found in the Roman baths, and which, in the time of Raphael became the foundation of Italian ornament.' \n\nJones's comments have the same flavour as those in <i>The catalogue of the Museum of Ornamental Art</i>, at Marlborough House (see cat. no. 4.1) and so it is no surprise to find that he was among those who made the selection of objects from the Great Exhibition of 1851 which formed the foundation of the Victoria and Albert Museum's collections.'",
