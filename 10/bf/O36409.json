            "physical_description": "The horse is of lithographed tin plate; with a barrel shaped body; long thin straight legs; a separate head; base and four wheels. The majority of the whole is coloured a soft yellow and designed to look like wood. It is decorated on the back with a red panel and dark blue stripes and on the head with a fine grey mane and black bridle. The tail is a diamond shaped piece of card. All the parts are cast in two halves and held by tongue and slot joints. The whole is supported by two uprights from the base while the base of each leg is attached to the wheel axles. A rod from the left front leg to the head moves the head as the horse walks along. The base is cut away to allow the legs to move and it is mounted on four wheels with the clockwork mechanism underneath and between the back wheels. It is wound by a separate key and as it moves along the legs go up and down and the head nods. The legs are governed by twists in the wheel axles. \n*It is very similar to the wooden push along horses available at the same time and thought to be quite rare.",
