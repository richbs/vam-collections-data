            "physical_description": "A skull cap of silk, linen and woollen layers and with gold decoration. The top layer is of compound woven, blue silk; thread dia. approx. 0.25mm. The next layer is of undyed linen that retains some of the blue dye from the upper layer; plain weave; approx. 18x18 tpc; z-spun. The next layer is also undyed, plain weave linen, but rougher; approx. 12x12 tpc; s-spun.  In one small area a wad of unprocessed wool remains attached, suggesting the cap had a final, inner layer of wool.\n\nThe cap is constructed from two, semi-circular sections joined at the centre to a decorative band and finished  round the edge with a smaller band.  Both bands appear to have been stitched to the top two layers with a blue, linen thread, while the rougher linen layer and wool were attached afterwards.\n\nThe outer band is 12mm wide. There are double warps of brown silk (possibly pink originally) and wefts of blue/brown silk. The outer side has secondary weft stitches for decoration, with threads which were probably wrapped in gold. The edges of this band are defined with a pink? stripe, 2mm wide on either side. It is stitched to the cap fabric with a whip stitch. There are three lines of blue thread stitching on the fabric that runs around the edge of fabric, above the band (in running stitch). These lines appear to end before  meeting the decorative band.\n\nThe decorative band is 20mm wide. It is tablet woven. It has double warps of linen? with wefts of dyed linen.  Moving in - the outer edges are stripes of dark brown (5mm wide), next are stripes of undyed linen (4mm wide) which meet at the centre with a stripe of dark blue (2mm wide).  A secondary weft of gold wrapped silk is woven though the outer side, in a series of horizontal lines. On either side of the decorative band three lines of blue thread stitching can be seen (running stitch) on the fabric. These appear to end before the edge of the cap.\n\nSome sandy residue remains and there is staining. There are holes, with one quarter of the cap missing.",

            "public_access_description": "A skull cap of silk, linen and woollen layers and with gold decoration. Egyptian, ca. AD1000-1400. From a tomb.  The top layer is of compound woven, blue silk; thread dia. approx. 0.25mm. The next layer is of undyed linen that retains some of the blue dye from the upper layer; plain weave; approx. 18x18 tpc; z-spun. The next layer is also undyed, plain weave linen, but rougher; approx. 12x12 tpc; s-spun.  In one small area a wad of unprocessed wool remains attached, suggesting the cap had a final, inner layer of wool.\n\nThe cap is constructed from two, semi-circular sections joined at the centre to a decorative band and finished  round the edge with a smaller band.  Both bands appear to have been stitched to the top two layers with a blue, linen thread, while the rougher linen layer and wool were attached afterwards.\n\nThe outer band is 12mm wide. There are double warps of brown silk (possibly pink originally) and wefts of blue/brown silk. The outer side has secondary weft stitches for decoration, with threads which were probably wrapped in gold. The edges of this band are defined with a pink? stripe, 2mm wide on either side. It is stitched to the cap fabric with a whip stitch. There are three lines of blue thread stitching on the fabric that runs around the edge of fabric, above the band (in running stitch). These lines appear to end before  meeting the decorative band.\n\nThe decorative band is 20mm wide. It is tablet woven. It has double warps of linen? with wefts of dyed linen.  Moving in - the outer edges are stripes of dark brown (5mm wide), next are stripes of undyed linen (4mm wide) which meet at the centre with a stripe of dark blue (2mm wide).  A secondary weft of gold wrapped silk is woven though the outer side, in a series of horizontal lines. On either side of the decorative band three lines of blue thread stitching can be seen (running stitch) on the fabric. These appear to end before the edge of the cap.\n\nSome sandy residue remains and there is staining. There are holes, with one quarter of the cap missing.",
