By the 1530s, small sprays of tulips and other recognisable flowers were a common motif on Izkik ceramics. But from the 1550s these were replaced by compositions on a larger scale, as seen on this plate with its  lotus bouquet motif.\n\nThe Ottoman court renewed its patronage of ceramics made in Iznik, north-west Anatolia, during the construction of the S\u00fcleymaniye mosque in Istanbul in 1550-1557. The first Iznik tiles were produced and potters added a bright red to the range of colours painted under the glaze. This was achieved with a slip (liquid clay) made from a special clay.\n\nIn the following decades, tiles of high quality were decorated in red, green and tones of blue on a white ground. Dishes, bottles and other vessels had similar decoration on white or coloured grounds.",
