The cabinet is in two stages, each being fitted with a number of small drawers.  In the upper stage the doors enclose a case containing four drawers; when this is removed another receptacle is disclosed, which is fitted at the back with looking-glass and has a floor covered with paper printed in a chequer pattern.  The drawers are lined with marbled paper, these linings with the looking-glass being, probably, of later date than the cabinet.  The decoration consists mainly of gold and silver floral arabesques, with flowers in vases on the large doors and the sides, the effect being heightened by mother-of-pearl inlay.  On their inner sides the doors bear the initials E.W. and a shield of arms--three lozenges conjoined erm - an achievement borne by two families - Gifford of County Devon, and Harrison of Goudhurst, Kent.  The doors have trefoil-headed brass hinges and foliated lock-plates.",

They were first recorded in England in 1540 in the reign of Edward VI.  A description of the King's 'secrete Juelhouse' mentioned 'three cabinets set in the wall covered with crimson velvet and garnished with golde and silver'.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe upper section has a mirrored lid. Beneath two doors enclose a compartment containing four drawers. These pull out to reveal another mirrored compartment, its floor covered with later paper printed with a chequer pattern. The lower section has further drawer, their fronts painted with arabesques.\n\nThe main doors and sides are painted with vases of flowers in gold and silver, inset with mother-of-pearl, on a black ground. The stemmed circular motifs that appear on both the exterior and interior resemble enamelled fan holders of the period.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe use of mother-of-pearl is characteristic of Japanese exports and of Indian and Islamic craftsmanship. The cabinet is dated 1620 by comparison with a japanned ballot box made in 1619 for the English East India Company. This belongs to the Saddlers' Company in the City of London.",

            "bibliography": "Cabinet, with mother-of-pearl inlay, and painted decoration in gold and silver on a black ground. The cabinet is in two stages, each being fitted with a number of small drawers. In the upper stage the doors enclose a case containing four drawers; when this is removed another receptacle is disclosed, which is fitted at the back with looking-glass and has a floor covered with paper printed in a chequer pattern. The drawers are lined with marbled paper, these linings with the looking-glass being, probably, of later date than the cabinet. The decoration consists mainly of gold and silver floral arabesques, with flowers in vases on the large doors and the sides, the effect being heightened by mother-of-pearl inlay. On their inner sides the doors bear the initials E.W. and a shield of arms--three lozenges conjoined erm - an achievement borne by two families - Gifford of County Devon, and Harrison of Goudhurst, Kent. The doors have trefoil-headed brass hinges and foliated lock-plates. Early 17th century. Plate 26. From catalogue H. 2 ft., W. 1 ft. 7 in., D. 10 \u00be in. (H. 61 cm, W. 48.3 cm, D. 27.3 cm) This is probably the earliest type of cabinet made in England, and closely resembles an example formerly in the Judges' Lodgings, Oxford (see 'The Dictionary of English Furniture,' Vol. I, Cabinets, p. 150, fig. 2, and the 'Burlington Magazine,' Vol. XXXI.) The decoration is very similar in style to that of a box and a set of roundels in the Museum (W. 30-1912, Catalogue N. 633), also a ballot box, dated 1619, belonging to the Saddler's Company and bearing the arms of James I and the East India Company.

Smith compared this cabinet to a similar one \"in private possession\" in an article Vol. XXXI of the Burlington Magazine and states \"its date can be placed with practical certainty in the reign of James I\".  The privately owned cabinet is painted on the inside only but on this cabinet \"the whole of the outside is not only decorated in gold and silver but is also inlaid with mother-of-pearl.  The inner sides of the doors bear amongst other decoration the initials E.W., and the shield of arms 'three lozenges cojoined erm' - an achievement bourne by two families:\n\tGifford, of Co.
