Her own prints show her concern with exploring surface and texture in lithography - something which tied in directly with her fascination with scientific developments at the time.\nThis image was later developed into a series called Justice, inspired by 'The Trial' a story by Franz Kafka.",

Although the small print was preparatory to the larger, Wayne entitled it 'Witnesses II' (cat 20). The three states of the larger image were originally called: I; II--first version; and II--second version. This numbering has caused some confusion and in this catalogue, arabic numbers have been assigned to each version, and Roman numbers to the states; thus the larger image becomes 'The Witnesses I' with states I, II and III; the smaller version (cat.20) becomes 'The Witnesses 2' . This state begins the 'Justice' Series which was inspired by Kafka's book 'The Trial'.\n\n*unpublished",
