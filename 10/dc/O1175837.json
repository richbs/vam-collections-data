The following year she met Ettore Sottsass which lead to an invitation to join the group Memphis. Bedin\u2019s contributions to Memphis were primarily in the area of lighting and graphic design. The iconic \u2018Superfloor\u2019 lamp and the much rarer \u2018Terminus\u2019 floor lamp were designed in the group\u2019s first year.
