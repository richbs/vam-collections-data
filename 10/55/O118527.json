This box is an interesting hybrid of gothic and classical ornament: the openwork is executed in the late gothic style whereas the fanlight motif at both ends of the lid and the engraved patterns on the ivory fillets are classical. Although Gothic tastes died hard in Venice, this casket was most likely assembled from old pieces of wood in an Italian or French workshop at a much later date.",
