His charismatic personality and leadership made him a focus of the country's hopes for a democratic future and his image inspired widespread loyalty. The Castle in Prague is the seat of the president and the slogan 'Havel to the Castle' was a call for Havel to become president.  He was selected as president of Czechoslovakia by parliament in December 1989 and was re-elected as president by the Federal Assembly after the free elections in June 1990. This photograph by Milo\u0161 Fikejz portrays Havel as a bohemian, a world-worn but visionary dissident. His image evolves in later posters which present him in a suit with the body language of a statesman.\n\n\nDesigned, printed and published in former Czechoslovakia",
