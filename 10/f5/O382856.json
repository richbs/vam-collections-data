Sk\u00e5ne province, in the extreme south of Sweden, has the richest tradition, and more jewellery was worn there than in any other district.   Almost all the Swedish traditional jewellery at the V&A comes from Sk\u00e5ne.  \n\nThe most popular necklace was a choker, made of several chains fastened at the front with a large decorative snap-clasp.  This is the clasp from such a necklace.  The two holes at the sides show that the necklace would originally have had two chains.  These clasps are often decorated with filigree and coloured pastes.  Swedish traditional jewellers made lavish use of coloured glass.  Red was the most popular colour, as everywhere in Europe.  The small loop on the lower edge would have held a small pendant heart.",
