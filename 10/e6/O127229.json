His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nSamson, an oratorio by Handel (1743), was performed at Covent Garden in 1958 to commemorate the bicentenary of the composer\u2019s death.  Critics found Messel\u2019s designs too exuberant for the stark monumentality of Handel\u2019s music \u2018Oliver Messel\u2019s pleasing though flimsy Tiepolo-like d\u00e9cor was conceived wholly in the vein of the relatively unimportant Delilah episode; something grander and sterner might have better suited the main action.\u2019  (Sunday Times, 23 November 1958)\n\nAct I opens with a procession of Philistines to Dagon\u2019s temple, the agricultural god of the Philistines.  According to Messel\u2019s notes on the design, the set is influenced by the seventeenth century English courtly masque tradition.  The foreground frame with arches \u2018is intended to look as if built for a masque with hedges either side' (Messel's notes on the design).",

Presented at the Royal Opera House, London by the Covent Garden Opera on 15 November, 1958, to celebrate the bicentenary of Handel\u2019s death.  There were some performances at the Leeds Festival in October 1957.  It was directed by Hubert Graf with  choreography by Meriel Evans and featured Jon Vickers as Samson and Elisabeth Lindermeier as Dalila.  \nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's theatre designs and other designs and artefacts.  The designs were briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being housed at the V&A from 1981 on indefinite loan.  The V&A Theatre Museum purchased the Oliver Messel collection from Lord Snowdon in 2005.\n\nHistorical significance: The first time this oratorio had been performed at Covent Garden.",
