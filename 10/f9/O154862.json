Toilet services were used by both men and women as part of a public dressing ceremony known as the lev\u00e9eor toilette. The custom of the lev\u00e9ewas started in the 17th century by Louis XIV. Adopted by the French upper classes, it continued as an important form of elite socialising through the 18th century. Toilet sets were key to the performance of wealth and fashion that was entailed in the ceremony of the toilette. Consisting of a series of boxes, dishes and a mirror, toilet services were expensive items made from luxury materials. \n\nThis box is decorated using a technique known as boulle marquetry, in which brass (and often pewter) motifs are inlaid into an expensive turtleshell ground. This technique was developed in the late 17th-century in the workshop of Andr\u00e9-Charles Boulle (1642-1732), a cabinet-maker who worked for the French court and nobility. Boulle marquetry remained fashionable in France (and across Europe) through the 18th and 19th centuries.",

A 'toilet service' comprised a matching set of a boxes, dishes, toilet accessories and a mirror. It would be found on a lady or man's dressing table in the 17th and 18th centuries. \n\nA fashion for elaborate toilet services originated in France in the 17th-century. Louis XIV (1638-1715) and his mother Anne of Austria (1601-1666) started the custom of the <i>lev\u00e9e,</i> in which courtiers were invited to gather in the royal bedchamber while the king or queen dressed. Over the course of the 18th century, the <i>lev\u00e9e</i> became a fashionable and popular practice among the upper classes, with <i>toilettes</i>attended by friends, family and servants.\n\nA toilet service was key to the performance of the <i>toilette</i>, providing not only a mirror to reflect the spectacle, but also small boxes and dishes designated for holding make-up, powders, sponges, pins and jewelry. Toilet services were expensive objects, often given as presents to commemorate events such as marriages. They tended to be made from fashionable luxury materials and reflected the wealth and status of their owner.",
