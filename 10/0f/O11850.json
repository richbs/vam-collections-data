The originals of the paintings that Day copied are in the 'Large Clive Album' in the collection of the Indian and South-East Asian Department (this is a copy of IS.133:50-1964). The drawings demonstrate the ancient Turlish art of 'ebru' (or 'abri') - marbling on paper. The patterning on the robes was achieved by the use of resists on the other parts of the drawing. (For a modern example of this technique by a Turkish artist, see E.1536-1991). Day's interest in this technique was apparently inspired by seeing examples exhibited at the V&A. It was made by the artist in the process of teaching himself the technique of integral paper marbling.",
