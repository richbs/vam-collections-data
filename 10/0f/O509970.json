            "historical_context_note": "This drawing represents a mythological subject traditionally interpreted as an allegory of friendship. It displays a young maiden with three cupids, crowning a heart with a wreath on an altar draped with garlands. The allegory of friendship was a recurring theme in Boucher\u2019s oeuvres (See Ecole Nationale des Beaux-Arts, Paris, Inv. No. 404). The V&A drawing was probably made as a finished drawing, and it is not related to any finished paintings. \n\nThe drawing can be dated to the late 1750s as Boucher\u2019s patron, Madame de Pompadour, the mistress of Louis XV, began promoting a cult of friendship in 1754, following shifting dynamics with the king. Although it is firmly attributed to Boucher, the drawing itself is not recorded in the latest catalogue raisonn\u00e9. Rather the closest record is that of a counterproof of a similar composition (Ananoff 939a), previously in the Collection Huser, Paris.\n\nBoucher\u2019s drawings were highly in demand and were often reproduced as well as widely disseminated through print.  This particular drawing was engraved by the French artist Ange-Laurent de La Live de Jully (1725-1779; See Yale University Art Gallery, Inv. No. 2008.96.3) as well as by Gilles Demarteau (1729-1776; Biblioth\u00e8que Municipale, Lyon, Inv. No. F18DEM003051). \n\nDemarteau\u2019s version was engraved in a particular technique called \u2018red chalk manner,\u2019 a method that imitated actual chalk drawings. Both versions offer variations to Boucher\u2019s original composition, including the displacement of a third cupid.  Boucher\u2019s later adapted the V&A composition into a <i>Project for a Frontispiece: Allegory of Friendship</i> (Ecole Nationale des Beaux-Arts, Paris, Inv. No. 404) and incorprated elements of the V&A drawing into his <i>Allegory for the Commemoration of a Marriage</i> (Metropolitan Museum of Art. Inv. No. 57.611). \n\nThis composition proved to be popular throughout the century and was copied in gouache by Jacques Charlier (Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Inv. No. RF4271), as a decorative enamel inset on oval snuff boxes by Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Mathis de Beaulieu ( Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Inv. No. OA2162), and as an oval miniature by Jean-Baptiste Isabey (Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Inv. No. RF5052).\n\nThe V&A drawing is a fine example of Fran\u00e7ois Boucher\u2019s artistic output as he favoured mythological and pastoral themes\u2014hallmarks of the Rococo movement. Fran\u00e7ois Boucher was a prolific painter and draughtsman and had a very successful career. A member of the Acad\u00e9mie Royale, he was appointed Premier Peintre du Roi at the end of his career in 1765.",
