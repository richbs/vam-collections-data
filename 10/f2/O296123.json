Unlike in most other European countries, women were just as likely to wear them as men.  Both sexes wore them in extravagant quantities, along the seams of jackets and trousers and in bunches at the wrist, as well as to fasten clothes.  \n\nThey were rarely sewn directly on to the clothing.  In Spain, buttons usually had toggle fittings, consisting of a bar permanently attached to the button by an oval loop.  They were used to fasten the clothing in the same way that cuff-links are still used today.\n\nThe design of the filigree of this button, and the cast bar, are both typical of Spanish buttons of the 19th century.",
