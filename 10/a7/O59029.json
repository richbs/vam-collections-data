They  probably came from a Japanese chest of around 1620-1640.\n\nTime\nBy about 1660 Japanese cabinets were much prized by the English nobility, as was any  piece of furniture from a workshop in Western Europe that incorporated parts that originally came from Japanese furniture. Japanese arms or 'mons' were emblems, such as animals or plants, for important families. They served a function similar to that of a coat of arms in Europe. They were often found on screens, chests and other objects, denoting the ownership and prestige of the family.\n\nPlace\nThis was almost certainly made for Robert Spencer, 2nd Earl of Sunderland (1641-1702), for his seat of  Althorp in Northamptonshire. It is referred to in the earliest surviving  inventory of the house, dating from October 1746, as 'a pier Glass in a Japan Frame'. It was then  in the India Silk Bedchamber at Althorp.\n\nLater History\nThe glass was replaced in 1914 and later in 1923. The cresting of the mirror was found in 1923. It was repaired with the mirror and refitted to it  by G. Koizumi, a leading specialist in lacquer restoration, that same year.",

The stretcher base of the table is fitted with a panel of very early export lacquer, c.1600, the main panels of the table and candlestand and the frame of the mirror date date from c.1630, and the chickens in takamakie on the rail of the mirror may be later still, perhaps 1670ish.  The 1630 pieces may be interesting in that they carry\u2026.a heraldic device of the Inoue family of Shimasa Province, near Tokyo.  This would add evidence to the suggestion that not all export lacquers were made for export\u2026.\"\n\n18/11/81 memo from Thornton to Director\n\"These suites were par excellence the grand decorative ensemble of the period\u2026The mirror still has its delicate fretwork cresting which has normally disappeared\".  Thornton recommends purchase.  He believes the suite must come from the Earl of Sunderland's period at Althorp.  The figure asked is \u00a330,000.  There is some hope of assistance from the Heritage Fund.\n\n25/11/81 memo from Thornton to Director\nproposes purchasing the suite out of the Brigadier Clark Fund.  Notes that the Japanese veneer is of great interest to the Far Eastern Department.\n\nDec. 1981 and Jan. 1982 correspondence\nrelates to purchase price and tax matters.\n\nJan. & Feb. 1982 correspondence \nrelates to arrangements to have Partridges copy the torchere.\n\nUndated (first draft) handwritten notes\nDescribes the lacquer work and explains such suites formed a spectacular focal point in the decoration of grand rooms during the Baroque period.  \"It has probably been at Althorp since it was new, in which case it will have formed part of the furnishings of the house when it belonged to the Earl of Sunderland\".  A listing in one inventory of 1746 may refer to this suite.",
