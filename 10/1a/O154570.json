            "public_access_description": "This piece is part of the Royal College of Art Visiting Artists Collection. Every year from 1987 to 2006, while David Watkins was Professor of Goldsmithing, Silversmithing, Metalwork and Jewellery at the RCA, he invited four jewellers and silversmiths from outside Britain to give a week-long masterclass. The artists brought diverse skills, aesthetics and approaches. The first call on their time was to interact closely with the students. In addition, although concentrating on their teaching and working in an unfamiliar studio, each artist generously made an object for the RCA's collection. The Royal College of Art Visiting Artists Collection, now transferred to the V&A, is a major document of international contemporary jewellery, a tribute both to the artists and to the vibrancy of the RCA as a teaching institution.\n\nJewellers in the late 20th century found new ways of drawing out gold's natural beauty. By exploring surface treatments and textures they created an effect very different from the bright metallic glint of polished gold. They restored an elemental simplicity and grandeur to this most enduring of metals.\n\nDaniel Kr\u00fcger emphasises the inherent softness of the metal by smoothing crumpled gold foil around a rough rock found in Hyde Park. This piece is typical of his work. He likes to juxtapose the precious with the banal to provoke thoughts of the viewer. He shows great creativity and such a wide range of styles, that many of his pieces were thought to have been made by different artist jewellers. He studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich, and is today a jeweller and ceramicist.",
