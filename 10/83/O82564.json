In his paintings, he sought to counter the influence of Western art as taught in art schools under the British Raj, by modernizing indigenous Moghul and Rajput traditions. His work became so influential that it was eventually accepted and regarded as a national Indian style within British and international art institutions.\n\nIn his work, Abanindranath retrieved themes from the Indian epic past or scenes from romantic tales, such as Arabian Nights or Omar Khaiyam and reworked them in a highly romanticised style. \n\nThis painting depicts a young woman performing 'Shiva-Puja',  worship of the Hindu god Shiva. She is dressed in a pale green and white sari seated on an animal skin placed on a low red charpoi. With her right hand she holds a tambura and with the her left she salutes a large black linga (representing Shiva) decked with red and white flowers. The night sky with a crescent moon can be seen in the background.

In his paintings, he sought to counter the influence of Western art as taught in art schools under the British Raj, by modernizing indigenous Moghul and Rajput traditions. His work became so influential that it was eventually accepted and regarded as a national Indian style within British and international art institutions.\n\nIn his work, Abanindranath retrieved themes from the Indian epic past or scenes from romantic tales, such as Arabian Nights or Omar Khaiyam and reworked them in a highly romanticised style. The artist\u2019s desire to emancipate Indian art from European influence was also fostered by Japanese artist Okakura Kakuzo, who visited him in 1902. Later, studying Japanese art under Japanese artists, Taikoan and Hilsida, Abanindranath assimilated Far Eastern techniques such as the wash into his work. His Omar Khaiyam series (1906-08) reflects such influences. Abanindranath\u2019s use of colour was also highly personalized and found its appropriate language in two major techniques: wash and tempera.",
