My good friend and artist Ruth Marten created a lot of ceramic art and had a kiln in the basement of her mothers house in Queens NY. One day, in 1973, I drove out there and we worked together in her basement. It is made out of white stoneware - I was asking her questions as I was building my shoe with the clay and she was giving me advice as to getting all the air out of the clay and the preparing of the material before starting the making of the shoe. She was working on her own art that day and it was so much fun working side by side. After it was put in the Kiln and fired I went back and put the glaze on the white shoe - I had to approximate the color, utilizing low fire glazes, and was uncertain as to exactly what would be the outcome. After the firing Ruth transported the shoe to me at my studio. I had planned to go back and do some more but I was so busy I never returned.\"\n\nQuoted in an email from Doug Dodds, 26/03/13, RF/2013/103.",
