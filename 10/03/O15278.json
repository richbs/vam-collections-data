Many fine hangings were woven to the designs of contemporary artists. Noemi Ferenczy was born into a family of eminent artists and studied tapestry weaving at the Gobelins in Paris.  She combined considerable artistic talent with weaving skills and her work is an important link between the European folk tradition of tapestries and the modern tapestries made by today's artist-weavers.",

Lily Markus's work is described as 'similarly pictorial and colourful' and close in 'style to that of No\u00e9mi Ferenczy with whom she had exhibited, and whose work had been attracting national and international attention in the 1930s.' They both explored the representation of craft and agricultural work, and made compsitions which combined human figures with trees, exotic animals and stylised foliage, inspired by French late Gothic verdure tapestries.",
