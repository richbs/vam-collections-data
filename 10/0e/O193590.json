An important point in Hungary's transition to democracy was the so called 'four-yes referendum' in the autumn of 1989. One of the questions voted on in the referendum was whether the Workers' Militia should be disbanded.  The answer was an overwhelming 'yes' because this armed force was regarded a symbol of the oppression of the K\u00e1d\u00e1r-regime that followed the failed 1956 revolution. The slate-grey uniformed and armed Workers' Militia was established in 1957 with the aim 'to defend the state of workers and peasants'. Service in this organisation, which replaced the special police force (karhatalom) of the former R\u00e1kosi-regime, was voluntary, but offered participants some carreer advantages.  \n\nThe poster demonstrates the active participation of the Alliance of Free Democrats in the preparations for the referendum. P\u00e9ter P\u00f3cs's image effectively translates the emotions of the Hungarian population into a visual idea full of sharp irony.",
