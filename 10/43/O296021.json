Most European cultures disapproved of male jewellery, but buttons allowed men to show off their wealth and status.  They wore them in extravagant numbers, on sleeves and trousers as well as jackets and waistcoats.  The most popular kinds, throughout the region, were round filigree buttons, which varied in design and details of construction from place to place.  \n\nSilver filigree buttons like these, called \u2018braamknopen\u2019 (blackberry buttons) in Dutch, are one of the commonest types of Dutch button.  They are now considered typical of Zeeland, but in the 18th and early 19th century they were worn throughout the Netherlands, and along the North Sea coast of Germany as well.  They are still being made today in much the same pattern as in the 18th century.  These buttons carry the mark of Jan Pieter van der Does, who worked in Goes from 1851-1897.",
