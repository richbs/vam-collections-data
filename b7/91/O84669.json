The perfume given off helped to create a refined setting for life at court. Court life also required singers, musicians and bottles of wine, all depicted on the roundels on the lid.\n\nMetalworkers often transformed objects made from brass by decorating them with sophisticated inlaid surface ornament. This piece was made when the inlay technique was at its peak.\n\nFor larger motifs, they chiselled out small areas of brass and filled them with thin sheets of silver (as here), gold and copper. They added details were added by chasing the surface of the softer metals and created contrast with a black filler. The results were, for metalwork, an unusually graphic form of decoration, often of great quality.",
