The plain, central band on the body has three cast shields lined horizontally and engraved: the central one shows a lion holding an axe; the left shield shows an ox's head; the right shield shows a trophy of meat cleavers (the latter two shields partly erased).\n\nTwo 'linen marks' inside the body show where the handle was cast directly onto the body: cold damp linen pressed on the inside while the mould containing the molten pewter for the handle was applied to the outside, prevented the hot pewter from burning through the body. The handle depicts a figure of Lucretia above a mask which is in  turn above another figure (now rubbed) standing in an archway. The top of the handle includes a five-ringed hinge to hold the lid. The lid has a large thumbpiece, a band of ornament and a 'spool' finial. The tankard sits on three feet cast in the same moulds as the finial.\n\nThe top and bottom of the body, the rim of the lid and the thumbpiece are decorated with bands of punched leaves, crosses and figure 'I's. Much of the tankard has the remains of silver plating.\n\nThe figurative ornament is based on cast plaquettes by the Nuremberg artist Peter Fl\u00f6tner (d. 1546). Vertical seams on the bands of ornament show that they were cast in separate moulds and bent around the body to form complete bands.",

            "public_access_description": "This is one of the finest surviving examples of a mid 16th-century guild flagon. The three cast shields on the body, engraved with an ox's head, a lion holding an axe and a trophy of meat cleavers, indicate that this was the flagon of a butchers' guild. The body is decorated with plaques after the celebrated German sculptor, medallist, cabinetmaker, woodcutter and designer, Peter Flotner.\n\nGuild flagons are some of the most monumental items of pewter ever commissioned. Large tankards like this one served in drinking rituals during guild ceremonies. They also acted as display centrepieces for the table. Large tankards were heavy enough when empty but once filled could not possibly be handed around. They were known as 'Schliefkanne' - literally, 'a pot that had to be dragged'. Smaller cups were passed around formally, starting with the Master of the Guild, with each participant sipping from the cup and proposing a toast. The guilds controlled almost every aspect of their trades, from purchasing raw materials and prescribing hours of work to ensuring quality of production and regulating the lives of the workers in their professions. \n\nPewter is an alloy or mixture of metals consisting primarily of tin. Adding metals such as copper and antimony makes pewter harder and more durable. The best alloys contain over 90% tin. Before 1800 lead was allowed in \u2018lay metal\u2019, a lower-quality alloy used for measures and boxes. \n\nPewter\u2019s low melting point makes it suitable for casting, though early casting moulds were expensive. Soft lead made casting easier, but was poisonous, so it was forbidden in \u2018flatware\u2019 such as plates, dishes and porringers which came into contact with food. Pewter\u2019s softness makes it ideal for engraving.",

Robinson was a prolific collector and persuaded the Museum's first director, Henry Cole, that historic works of art were as instructive to students as 'modern manufactures'. Under Robinson's guidance, some of the earliest purchases by the Museum included outstanding examples of European pewter.\n\nHistorical significance: This is one of the finest examples of a mid 16th-century guild flagon to survive.
