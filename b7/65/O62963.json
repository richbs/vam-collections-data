The suggestion of theatricals in Perth at such an early date was as unexpected as it was interesting.  The play-bill was viewed by many theatre-goers in Perth, and others, with a love of the history of the city.  The play-bill is now in the possession of Messrs William Fettes & Son, antique dealers, 15 Atholl Street, Perth, who will no doubt be pleased to show it to those who have a liking for such things.",

McLaren with music composed by Mr. D'Assti, and the evening concluded with the musical entertainment The Romp.  Mrs. D'Assti appeared in all three plays, and Mr. D'Assti appeared in Auld Robin Grey and The Romp.\n\nA newspaper cutting from the Perthshire Constitutional & Journal, dated 28 September 1931, glued to the back of the frame in which the playbill was framed when it was given to the museum, shows that the playbill was sold 'the other day' at Messrs.
