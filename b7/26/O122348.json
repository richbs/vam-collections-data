Between about 1625 and 1650, a large number of Dutch craftsment established factories at Tula and it became the most important centre of arms production in Russia. More factories were built in 1712 on the orders of Czar Peter the Great (1672-1725), because of the increased demand for weapons caused by the Great Northern War with Sweden (1700-21).\n\nTula products very quickly developed their own distinctive style, characterized by the use of gold and silver floral devices inlaid into the steel, heavy gilt-brass mounts and, from c. 1780, beads of cut steel set against a delicate peacock-blue ground. This decorative technique derived from similar work produced in England and France.\n\nFrom the 1740s onwards an important aspect of the production of the Tula armourers was the manufacture of furniture in steel. Tables, folding chairs, mirrors, caskets, chess sets and even complete fireplaces were made, usually decorated with steel beadwork. Much of this furniture was made for the imperial palaces such as Pavlovsk and Yekaterinsky but some Tula work owas also exported. The fireplace displayed here, complete with its original fittings was in an English collection and the folding chair illustrated below was in one of the imperial German residences. A very similar chair can be seen nearby (Museum No. 1387-1888). Makers sometimes signed their pieces and celebrated craftsmen include the Leontiev family who worked on firearms from c. 1770-90 and Adryan Sukharov who in 1784 made a magnificent chess set and casket of steel. These, with various other Tula products, are now in the Hermitage, St Petersburg.\n\nFrom c. 1800 many presentation arms were made and Tula products were also exhibited at the International Exhibitions, such as that in Paris of 1867.\n[Ironwork Galleries]\n"

            "history_note": "The ironworks at Tula, nearly 200 km south of Moscow, were founded in 1712 as an Imperial armoury to provide Tsar Peter the Great's troops with arms in their battles against Charles XII of Sweden. By the mid-eighteenth century, production had diversified and the smiths at Tula were becoming famous for making luxury domestic objects such as caskets, tables and chairs. These objects were elaborately decorated with gilding and bluing. Some furniture of this type bears inscriptions and dates, notably a single chair in the Russian Museum, Leningrad, dated to 1744, and a set of 12 chairs in the Yekaterininsky Palace: 'Made at the Crown Tula Arms Factory 1746'. The V&amp;A chair bears no such inscriptions and was acquired as a seventeenth-century Spanish piece from the Londesborough Sale for \u00a3320.5.0. Although it is usually referred to as a 'folding chair', in fact it is not designed as a lightweight and portable item of furniture. The x-frame does not fold up, and although the chair can be dismantled in sections, its metal construction makes it too heavy to lift comfortably. Holes in the feet show that it originally moved about on casters.  A similar chair illustrated in a nineteenth-century watercolour is depicted with casters on its feet (Potsdam: Schloss Charlottenhof, Stiftung Preu\u00dfische Schl\u00f6sser und G\u00e4rten Berlin-Brandenburg, inventory no. spsg 5640). This chair is decorated with the monogram 'EP', for Tsarina Elisabetha Petrowna (daughter of Peter the Great, she reigned 1741-1761); two other inscriptions in Russia record it was made by 'Masolow' at Tula in 1744. It arrived in Germany as a diplomatic gift in the nineteenth century. The Russian Tsar Nicholas I (1825-1855) presented it to Princess Elizabeth of Prussia (1815-1885) and the watercolour records its location next to a writing desk in the Princess's apartments in the Charlottenhof Castle (Potsdam, North-West Germany). The castle is now a Museum, and the chair (inventory no. SPSG IV 124) is in the same location today as it was when painted by an unknown artist in the 1830s.",
