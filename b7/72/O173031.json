Although the 'fruit and nut' chocolate bar came onto the market in  the 1920s and has remained popular ever since, it was during the 1960s, when advertising agency, Young & Rubicam, had the Cadbury franchise, that some of its most memorable advertising  appeared. \n\nThe 'Fruit and Nut case'  appeared in various guises but perhaps most popularly as advertising placards on London's tube train network. Many of the images produced for the campaign worked imaginatively around the concept that viewers would be in this particular location when reading the advertisement. With a captive audience, the advertisers were able to use quite a lot of text, something which would not have beeen suitable for larger advertising billboards; here, witty reference is also made to the 'jogging motion of the train'.",
