It was produced in a variety of different decorative patterns.\n\nPeople\nHenry Stacy Marks (1829-1898) was one of a number of freelance designers who became associated with the Minton firm. He supplied designs for use at their Art Pottery Studio in London, established by Colin Minton Campbell in 1871. Here, wares brought from Stoke-on-Trent were decorated by professional, often female, painters, and fired in a specially constructed kiln. Marks, along with a variety of other artists of the time, had a fascination for Medieval themes, and frequently portayed figures in Medieval dress, as on these flasks. His links with the Minton firm may have ended in 1875, when the London studio was destroyed by fire. However, designs in production at the studio continued to be made in Stoke after its demise, as these examples show.\n\nTrading\nThis pair of flasks [with museum no. C.55-1927] was sold by the high class London china and glass retailer, Thomas Goode & Co. They were bought by Lady Constance Stern, who later gave them to the Museum.",
