It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years. Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nThe Manchester-born actor Ralph Lynn made his first appearance on the London stage at the Empire Theatre in 1915, having already appeared on the stage in the United States. He developed his character of a monocle-wearing 'silly ass' aristocrat, and became one of the most accomplished actors in farce on the British stage.  With Tom Walls and Robertson Hare he was part of the trio of actors who appeared in the pre-war Aldwych Theatre farces written by Ben Travers including Tons of Money (1922), Rookery Nook (1926), Plunder (1928) and Turkey Time (1931). After reprising his stage role as Gerald Popkiss in the 1929 film of the Aldwych Farce Rookery Nook with Tom Walls, Winifred Shotter, Mary Brough and J. Robertson Hare, Lynn appeared in several other films.",
