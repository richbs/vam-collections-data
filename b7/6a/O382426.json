The devastation caused by the Paris Commune, the heavy reparations demanded by Prussia, and the loss of almost 15,000 square kilometres of territory, including Alsace and Lorraine, made the resumption of normal jewellery production seem frivolous.  Instead many silversmiths turned their hands to patriotic jewellery.\n\nThis stud is an example of this kind of jewellery, which valued symbolism far more than artistic effect.  The shield on the right bears the arms of Lorraine, one of the two lost provinces.  The shield on the left would normally have the corresponding arms of Alsace, six golden crowns, but instead has a lion rampant.  Between the shields is an anchor, representing hope, wrapped in chains. \n\nSouvenir jewellery of this kind was made in gold and oxydised silver, but most often of plated metal.  It was immensely popular in France itself, but also among the British, whose sympathy had been strongly on the side of the French during the war, and who were always ready to adopt French fashions in the 19th century.",
