            "public_access_description": "These designs are for gas lighting bracket lamps for attachment to the wall of a church or cathedral. They were drawn by the metalworker Francis Skidmore (born in Birmingham, 1817, died in Coventry, 1896) about 1865-1872 and made by his firm Skidmore's Art Manufactures Company, Coventry. Skidmore was particularly interested in the developing technology of gas lighting. His firm installed it in three buildings in Coventry - in the medieval St Mary's Hall in 1850, in St Michael's church a year later and in Holy Trinity Church in 1856.  In the following decades, Skidmore continued to design brackets for gas lighting which existed throughout Britain in this period. Inspired by Gothic decoration, the scrolling acanthus leaf  in the space between the pipe of the bracket and the wall, and the elements picked out in colours, in these designs demonstrate this artist-craftsman's involvement in the Gothic Revival. This movement, which was architectural in subject, originated in mid-eighteenth century England and by the nineteenth century practitioners sought to revive medieval forms.",
