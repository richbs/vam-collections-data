The pattern consists of an outer border of joined, stylised vine leaves and an inner narrow border. Four roundels remain within the border.  One contains a vase with floral icons. The other three roundels have geometric designs of a central circle (half tan, half green) within a circle of undyed linen. Six small circles of undyed linen with a woollen central dot, surround it (and are joined to it with a single line). There are remains of another roundel with a square border. In the corner of this square are three circles (two green, one tan). The piece is stained and has dirt and silvery crystals in some parts.",
