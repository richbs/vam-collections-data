Her head is crowned with a band of red roses with green leaves. The image and title are surrounded by a gold line with scrolled decorations at each corner. Signed J Brandard.",

Thus, hoping to repeat the success, Grisi introduced the polka into the ballet The Devil to Pay (Le Diable a quatre). \nThe Polka originated in Bohemia, so Grisi's 1843 costume reflected east European national dress.  In Le Diable a quatre, she and her partner are dressed in standard ballet costumes of the period; he wears a skirted tunic and she the bell-shaped, calf-length dress with low necked, fitted bodice that had, by the 1840s, become almost a uniform for the ballerina.  There is little connected with Poland, where the ballet was set.  \nThe print was originally the front cover of the sheet music.  In the 19th century, no self-respecting household was without a piano, and tens of thousands of pieces of music were produced to fulfil the need for home entertainment.  Many were decorated with illustrations and portraits of the famous performers of their day.",
