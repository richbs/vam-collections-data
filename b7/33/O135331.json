Some were made from whalebone inserted into cotton petticoats, but the more complicated versions incorporated lacing to control the shape.\n\n'Dress improvers', as they were also known, allowed the fashionable woman to wear extremely complicated drapery and trains extending from the back of her gown, creating an increasingly narrow and slender silhouette. Different types of tournures were available to suit various garments and pastimes - longer ones were for evening dress, shorter ones for walking or morning dress. By the early 1880s they had reached almost ridiculous proportions, and they passed out of favour by the end of the decade.",
