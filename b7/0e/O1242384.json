Seated in the foreground of the sketch are an illustrious audience with Queen Victoria (1819-1901) and her son, Edward VII (1841-1910), then Prince of Wales at its centre. The image has been signed by the artist, T or J.Robinson, in the bottom left hand corner.\n\nThe Waterloo Chamber at Windsor Castle was built in tribute to the success of the forces of Great Britain, Austria, Prussia and Russia at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815 when Napoleon Bonaparte was finally defeated. A vast and imposing room, it was frequently used as a venue for theatrical and musical performances during Queen Victoria's reign, and a temporary stage was often erected for these events. \n\nThis item is one of several theatrical drawings from a collection of sketches commissioned from contemporary artists to be printed in illustrated magazines. The collection was donated to the museum by Sir William James Ingram in 1914.",
