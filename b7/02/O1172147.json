Much like concert t-shirts, which advertise a concert the wearer has been to, this pair of pants would show the wearer's allegiance to a specific subculture, although it would only be revealed upon undressing! \n\nThe slogan on the back of the underpants refers to the song Sit On My Face, sung by the members of Monty Python's Flying Circus. It has been performed by them many times at their live concerts and features on several of their albums. The lyrics, which contain many references to fellatio and cunnilingus, are sung to the melody of Sing As We Go by Gracie Fields. The Python team have received legal threats for copyright infringement, but have still published it on their albums, and the song has been banned on American radio due to its lyrical content.",
