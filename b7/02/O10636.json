Geoffrey Goodden, in his 2004 book on New Hall quotes an entry in a London auction catalogue of April 1786, which included a 'most capital tea and coffee equipage of rich crimson and gold curiously painted in figures by the  ingenious Mr Devivi, no other set of this colour was ever made, and the art is entirely lost since Mr Sprimont's decease'. He argues that the teapot was from this service, and that it is of Chelsea porcelain. Nicholas Sprimont, the owner and manager of the Chelsea factory died in 1771, having sold the works in 1769. In October 1769 Fidelle Duvivier signed a year contract to paint porcelain for William Duesbury of the Derby porcelain factory, and he was still in Derby in March 1771, when a son of his was born. If the teapot belonged to the service sold in 1786, it would need to date from the later 1760s.",
