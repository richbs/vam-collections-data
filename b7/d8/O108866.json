            "public_access_description": "Charles Voysey was one of the most original and influential architects and designers of all forms of decorative art working at the end of the 19th century. In 1882 he set up his own architecture practice and from the late 1880s started to design repeating patterns for wallpaper and woven and printed textiles and carpets.\n\nThis design probably appeared in the 1888 Arts and Crafts Exhibition in London. The show was a great success and received wide publicity, even in mainland Europe. Experts still argue about how much influence Voysey and his fellow designers had on the development of the Art Nouveau style. Voysey was an austere man, and could not accept that he had any part to play in the development of the exuberant European version of the style. However, his dramatic large-scale floral shapes do seem to have influenced the Art Nouveau posters and graphics by the Czech designer Alphonse Mucha.\n\nVoysey\u2019s most interesting designs date from this time and are dominated by flowing patterns incorporating pastel-coloured birds, animals, hearts, flowers and trees. He sold his work to manufacturers such as G. P. & J. Baker, Thomas Wardle and Alexander Morton. This design was probably sold through Liberty\u2019s, London.",
