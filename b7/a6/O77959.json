Even if it were not dated, the almost Gothic shape of the top of this example would date it to the late 18th century - earlier flasks being usually round in form.\n\nOwnership & Use\nThere is no evidence that these little flasks were ever used. Instead they were preserved in cottages or farmhouses to become family heirlooms, eventually to become museum objects. Now the number of surviving genuine inscribed and decorated flasks probably exceeds the number of plain utilitarian harvest flasks.So popular were they with collectors around 1900, that reproductions were made by the Dicker Pottery in Sussex.\n\nMaterial & Making\nUsing the slipware potter's red and white clays, the rural potteries of Sussex invented a style of decoration peculiar to their area. Tiny letters and symbols of printers' type were impressed into the red clay before firing, after which the impressions were filled with white clay and scraped clean. When covered with a rich lustrous lead-glaze and fired, the delicate creamy-white patterns on the coarse red background produced an inexpensive but highly effective form of decoration.",
