She met a man in Chicago, they became lovers. Her lover made a bad move. For balance; her mom and dad dead. The ladder of life is a mystery. Her twins were born in 82. She went through the fire and the rain. TESTED. SURVIVED. Like the devil himself had taken over, but you see, not so. Her faith kept her strong and she longed to be free. She had no choice but to dig in deep for a chance to make it happen. So she rose to the occasion screaming all the way. And fighting.

A bold and simplified self portrait is overwritten with images, symbols and script which retell a personal narrative. The same narrative is presented in a piece of handwritten text pasted to the portrait. Humphrey began sketches for this portrait in 1986, inspired by images of veiled women and by a National Geographic photograph of a woman with a Sanskrit prayer tattooed across her face.\n\nHumphrey studied printmaking at the California College of Arts and Crafts and received her MFA in printmaking from Stanford University. After her studies, she travelled in Europe, Brazil, the Caribbean and Africa. She taught art in Benin, Nigeria and Uganda. Humphrey\u2019s interest in oral traditions and storytelling is also apparent in this work.",
