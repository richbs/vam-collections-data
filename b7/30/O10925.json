In the 18th century, refined white sugar generally came in large cones, which would be cut into small lumps in the kitchen with shears. The sugar bowl would be set on the table, and would have contained lump sugar, served with tongs. At this date sugar was imported into Britain from slave plantations in the West Indies, notably the island of Jamaica. Sugar was a luxury and a costly commodity, and was taken with tea and with coffee.\n\nFunction & Form\nSince the Chinese did not take sugar with their tea, and therefore had no sugar bowls, the English goldsmiths were obliged to develop new forms for the tea service. This form imitates the Chinese porcelain tea bowls and covers that were imported in vast quantities at the time. The flat cover with its raised ring finial could be inverted to serve as a small dish or tray, possibly to hold spoons, or the sugar tongs.\n\nDecoration\nThis simple, early form is generally left plain, the only decoration being the engraved armorials.",
