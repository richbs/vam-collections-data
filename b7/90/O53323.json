            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nA music stand such as this one was predominantly used by harpists during the Regency period. The harp was a particularly fashionable instrument for women to play.\n\nDesign & Designing\nRegency style in England was influenced by ancient Greek and Roman forms, transmitted through the work of influential figures such as Henry Holland and Thomas Hope. You can see typical Neo-classical motifs on the music stand, similar to those found in Regency architecture. These include anthemions (honeysuckle), palmettes, scrolling acanthus, and bellflowers enclosed by borders of spherical beads. The crescent shape of the music rest itself is based on the pelta, a leather shield carried by peltast soldiers in ancient Greece.\n\nPeople\nThe firm of Erard, who made the stand, played an important part in the history of musical instruments.  S\u00e9bastien Erard founded the firm in Paris in the 1770s.  As the French Revolution unfolded in the 1780s and 1790s, his close relationship with the court of Louis XVI made it necessary for him to leave France. He moved to London, where he opened his business in 1792 at 18 Great Marlborough St, Soho. He was a prolific inventor and entrepreneur, developing the Double Action Harp (allowing it to play in many keys) in 1811 and patenting the double escapement piano (which allowed the hammer to leave the keys quickly so that they could vibrate) in 1824. Besides harps and pianos, the firm also sold cases, 'music desks', extra strings and at least two kinds of music stands: mahogany and 'japanned and gilded'.",
