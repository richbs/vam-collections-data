Talbot's discoveries of the 1830s through a cousin of Talbot and a Oxford friend and neighbour of Jones in South Wales. Subsequently, Jones became one of the few Britons to produce a substantial body of calotypes in Britain and abroad. His work stands out in the early development of photography because of his ability to fuse his technical skill with the influence of his training as a watercolorist.\n\nIn 1853, Jones moved to Belgium and remained there until the death of his wife in 1856. During that time he took a number of photographs in Bruges, especially in the medieval centre of the town This view, with tall foreground buildings framing the street and a focus of interest at the far end, echoes many of his earlier compositions in Italy and Bristol..",
