New mottoes were chosen at each call; the rings differing in value according to the rank of their recipients. The rings were generally gold with a suitable motto inscribed around the outer hoop.

They frequently also gave further rings as souvenirs to their friends. The practice came to an end when the office was abolished by the Judicature Act of 1875. New mottoes were chosen at each call; the rings differing in value according to the rank of their recipients. The rings were generally made of gold with an appropriate legal or patriotic motto inscribed around the hoop although some early examples appear to have been enamelled.\n\nThe custom of giving rings is described by Sir John Fortescue around 1470 in 'De Laudibus Legum Angliae' as follows: all serjeants at their appointment <font -i>\"shall give rings of gold to the value of forty pounds at the least, and your Chancellor well remembreth that at the time he received this state and degree, the rings which he then gave stood him in fifty pounds\"</i> (De Laudibus Legum Angliae c.59). A full description of the investiture ceremonies and a list of mottoes up to 1765 was given by Mr Serjeant Wynne in <font -i>Observations touching the Antiquity and Dignity of Serjeants at Law</i>, 1765.\n\nTwo similar rings bearing the same motto can be found in the collection of the British Museum (Dalton, p 239). The letter C found on the inner hoop may be an ownership mark to indicate either the recipient or the identity of the giver.\n\nA similar ring inscribed 'REGIS PREP* LEG + EX' found as part of the excavation of Chester Amphitheatre in 2005 and now in the Chester Museum retains red and white enamel on the two engraved flowers and traces of black enamel in the letters. This suggests that the V&amp;A ring would have been similarly enamelled. (Treasure Act Annual Report, 2005-6, cat. 715.",
