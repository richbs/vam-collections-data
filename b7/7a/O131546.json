The opening is surrounded by a wreath. The two legs have been tenoned into the seat, each using two, angled rectangular tenons (3 of them wedged). Note that the tenons are irregular (more difficult to cut this way, and would be strained when the stool is lifted by the seat, although they are angled and have been wedged, but note that one wedge has been inserted along the long side. \n\nOne leg has a pierced rosette with 6-pointed star tracery, the other with trefoil tracery, while the cusped, ogee arch on each leg has been carved on its inner as well as outer face. The legs now have rounded edges but were probably finished with a flat chamfer that has worn. The rail joining the legs is pierced with tracery and rosettes, and is tusk tenoned.\n\nOn the underside of the seat carved III V [the V shape carved out not just lines].\nThe tusks replaced.",
