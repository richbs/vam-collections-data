In fact, they were acquired before the Museum even existed, by its predecessor, the Department of Science and Arts Museum, and the paper label of that museum can still be found on the back of one of them.\n\nThey were made in what is now Epirus, in northern Greece, or Albania.    They were described as \u2018modern Turkish\u2019 at the time, as both places were still part of the Ottoman Empire in 1853.  They are part of a belt fitting.  A narrow leather strap would have hooked over the bar on one part, to attach it to the belt, and the rod on the back of the other part may have been inserted through a hole to secure the belt, although that is an unusual way to fasten an Albanian clasp.  Albanian clasps were briefly very popular in Britain in the 1870s, after the fashionable Bond Street jeweller, W. H. Thornhill, included one in his Christmas range in 1874.",
