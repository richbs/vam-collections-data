Albert was the companion and the disciple of Saint William of Maleval, a Tuscan penitent of the 12th century, who withdrew in an especially horrid valley of Siena where he died in 1557.",

It is a fine example from Rosa's large output of prints and shows a rarely-depicted episode inspired by the medieval Tuscan history: the life of Albert, companion and disciple of Saint William of Maleval, a Tuscan penitent of the 12th century, who withdrew in a particularly horrid valley of Siena where he died in 1557. \nThe main character is a direct quotation of a well-known Antique statue: <i>Marsyas</i> in the Uffizi, Florence. Legend has it that Marsyas competed with Apollo in a musical context and lost. He was then punished for having defied the god and was slayed alive by Apollo himself. The statue was transferred from Florence to Rome at the end of the 16th century and appears in an inventory of the Villa Medici in 1598. This famous statue was reproduced in the major anthologies of prints (Perrier, 1638, plate 18; Maffei, plate xxxi). Rosa depicted the pain of this particularly harsh penitent life through the tension of the stretched body, which imitates the position of Christ on the cross, mirrored in the Crucifix lying at his feet. This print forms a pair with <i>St William of Maleval</i>, of which an impression is also in the V&A collection (See 23200:1).\nA preparatory drawing for this composition, with slight differences in the background, is in the collection of Lord Leicester in Holkham Hall. A copy of the print in reverse was published by Johann Jakob von Sandrart (1685-1698) while another copy in the same direction was published by Carlo Antonini in 1780. \nThe subject of this large etching responds to Rosa's ambition to be known as a 'painter philosopher'. This intellectual attitude could be easily circulated through prints, which were relatively cheap and were widely disseminated. \n\nThe original plate is preserved at the Calcografia Nazionale in Rome (Inv. 747m).",
