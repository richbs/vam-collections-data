This room provided separate accommodation for the children of the family and the nursemaid, nanny and governess who looked after them. All kinds of furnishings were designed specially for children, including nursery wallpapers. The designs considered suitable for nursery wallpapers were either educational or morally improving subjects. They were usually decorated with pictures, as seen on this paper, which has figures representing the months of the year. The illustrations were adapted from Kate Greenaway's Almanack', which was published once a year from 1883 to 1897. Greenaway was a very popular and successful illustrator of children's books. Her drawings were often copied or adapted to other uses. This wallpaper is a so-called 'sanitary' paper. It is printed in waterproof colours and designed to be washable.",
