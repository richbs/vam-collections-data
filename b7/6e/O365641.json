Fourteen leading British Designers were invited to make clothes and accessories using the tyre tread design. These commissions represented a significant break-away from the traditional Pirelli Calendars and resulted in an unusual and stylistically powerful collection. The dramatic photographs were taken by Norman Parkinson. At the Calendar launch the collection was auctioned for charity and later the owners generously gave these unique works to the V&A.\nThe Mannequins and display are by the Creative Team of Adel Rootstein Hopkins Ltd.\nThe display will be in the Dress Collection from 5th November 1986 to Autumn 1987. It is divided into two parts, one on either side of the Dress Collection at the entrances from Rooms 21 and 47 respectively.",
