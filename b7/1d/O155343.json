            "physical_description": "Holster for a pistol or revolver, leather and silk velvet embroidered with silk in straight stitches, couched metal thread and cotton in chain stitch.\nBasically this is an elongated triangle with slightly curving sides.  The back is flat and is made from brown leather stamped with a pattern of pairs of vertical and diagonal lines forming a chevron design with circular indentations. At the bottom is an arch-shaped piece of green leather [into which a strap would have been inserted].  The lower edge is bound with a narrow strip of green leather.  A fine line of alternating black and white cotton in chain stitch goes down the sides and over the point of the green arch.  Towards the top of the back there is a larger downward pointing arch shape in green leather with the same black/white stitching.  Inserted into this are the two ends of a brown leather strap forming a loop and stitched in place with cotton twine.  These are further secured by horizontal pieces of brown and green leather which are stitched into 2 small horizontal arch-shaped pieces of green leather. \nThe front is formed by a curved piece of leather joined down the sides to the back but open at the bottom.  An arch-shaped flap of leather covers the upper half of the front.  The flap and the uncovered part of the front are covered with dark blue velvet which must have been embroidered first and then glued [?] to the leather.  The sides have been reinforced with a strip of leather and the edges of the flap are worked into a chevron pattern using green, red, white, mauve [faded], blue and yellow silk.\nThe flap is embroidered with the seated figure of a man with a bird on his left hand.  He is within an arch shape.  There is a border on 3 sides [not across the top] with a meander with flowers and leaves.  Red, dark red, green and a little yellow silk is used for details. The main embroidery is couched metal thread. The lower part of the front has a long, lobed cypress tree, stems and flowers. There are two embroidered green spots at the bottom.\nSilk: 2S\nMetal Thread: [1] silver strip open and close S-wound on white silk and couched over card shapes.\n[2] silver-gilt strip open and close S-wound on white silk and couched over card shapes.",
