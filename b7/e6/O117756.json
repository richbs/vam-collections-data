Although this sketch was not used for the engraving, the subject of Jaques, the melancholic philosopher of Shakespeare's comedy As You Like It clearly captured his interest.  John Martin, who had commissioned the design, wrote in the introduction to the book: 'The interest which [Constable] took in the trifling affair required of him, is best evinced by the fact that he had made nearly twenty sketches for the \"melancholy Jaques\"'.",

The work was undertaken by Constable at the request of John Martin (see also No. 354 [174-1888]), who says in his introduction to the book: \"The interest which the first-named took in the trifling affair required of him, is best evinced by the fact that he had made nearly twenty sketches for the 'melancholy Jaques'''. C. R. Leslie chose the design finally used, and drew it on the wood block for the engraver. Beckett (<i>Connoisseur</i>, Vol. CXXXIV, 1954, pp. 80-4) discusses, with reproductions, the relationship between Constable's drawings for Van Voorst's publication and the earlier water-colour he had made c.1828, based on a painting by Sir George Beaumont which is now in the Tate Gallery (No. 119). It appears that Constable turned his attention to the book illustration about 1834; certainly the style of No. 407 [795-1888] is close to that of No. 368 [818-1888] of 1834. \nThe notes on Dedham Church on the back of the drawing in the British Museum (L.B. 4), which is closer to the engraved version, suggest a connection with the letterpress Constable was drafting for <i>English Landscape Scenery</i>, c.1833-5. \nThe originating idea for the compositions by Beaumont and Constable appears to have been W. Hedges's illustration of the scene, engraved by S. Middiman for Boydell's <i>Shakespeare</i>.\u201d\nR. B. Beckett, <i>Connoisseur</i>, vol.
