This sock, made in this method, was intended to be worn with sandals, as the big toe is shaped separately from the other toes. It was excavated from Christian burial grounds of the late Roman period, found in the present-day city of al-Bahnasa in Egypt.\n\nThis used yarn threaded through the eye of a sewing needle worked in the round through a series of loops. It was much more laborious and slower than knitting with two needles, as the yarn could only be worked in short lengths. Extra pieces of yarn had to be spliced on as the \u2018knitting\u2019 progressed.",
