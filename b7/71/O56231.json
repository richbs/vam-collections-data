Cooke visited various antiques dealers in London's Wardour Street and numerous curiosity shops in order to make up a convincing assemblage of antiques and botanical and zoological specimens. Prior to the rush of classification that was a feature of High Victorian science, many collectors and antiquaries had chaotic arrays of curiosities strewn around their rooms. As more scientific-minded historians and biologists replaced antiquaries, nostalgic pictures of picturesque but random collections like this were increasingly in demand. It has been suggested that Cooke was inspired by the description of Jonathan Oldbuck's study in Sir Walter Scott's novel The Antiquary, published in 1816.\n\nPeople\nEdward William Cooke (1811-1880) started painting when he was very young, and aged only nine made drawings for the Encyclopaedia of Plants (1820). He had a long and profitable career as a marine painter, exhibiting 130 works at the Royal Academy. John Sheepshanks collected 11 of his paintings, as well as a number of watercolour studies for them.",

As a boy, drew plants for his father's engravings for Loddiges's monthly <i>The Botanical Cabinet</i> (1817-33). Also made preliminary drawings for his father's <i>London and its Vicinity</i> (1820-34) which were used by illustrators such as Stanfield, Prout, Cotman and Callcott, and worked on John Loudon's <i>Encyclopaedia of Plants</i> (1829). Etched his own illustrations for <i>Shipping and Craft</i> (1828-9) and with his father for Views of the Old and the New London Bridges (1833). Evidently made preliminary drawings for Stanfield. Painted in watercolours until 1834, when, after one lesson with James Stark, a family friend, he was inspired to paint in oils. Exhibited mostly marine and coastal subjects; 130 at the RA between 1835 and 1879,115 at the HI 1835-67, and three at the SBA 1835, 1838, 1876. Elected ARA 1851, RA 1863. Travelled extensively in Britain and abroad, most frequently in France from 1833, Holland from 1837, and Venice from 1850; also Italy 1845-6, Spain 1860-61, Egypt 1874. His inherited interest in natural history led to membership of several learned societies, notably FRS 1863, and his publication of <i>Grotesque Animals</i> (1872). Also published <i>Landscapes British and Foreign</i> (1874) and <i>Leaves from my Sketchbooks</i> (1876, 1877). Died Groombridge, Kent, 4 January 1880; his studio sales were at Christie's 22 May 1880 and 11 March 1882. \n\nLIT: Edited transcript of the artist's MS Diary, National Maritime Museum; MS Ledger of paintings completed 1829-78 (referred to below as <i>Ledger</i>), RA Library;<i>Illustrated London News</i> 13 August 1864, pp 173-4 (with engr portrait); <i>Art Journal</i> 1869, pp253-5; J Munday 'E W Cooke, Marine Painter' <i>Mariner's Mirror</i> (Society for Nautical Research) 1967, vol 53, pp99-113); <i>Edward William Cooke</i> Guildhall Art Gallery exhibition catalogue 1970, information also kindly supplied by John Munday \n\n<b>The Antiquary's Cell</b> \nFA42 Neg GD2505 \nPanel, 57.8 x 75.6 cm (22\u00be x 29\u00be ins) \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nIn the <i>Ledger</i> as bought by Sheepshanks for \u00a347 5s, and showing the 'interior of my own study at Barnes'. Exhibited at the BI in 1836, the size given in the catalogue as '34 by 42 inches' (presumably including the frame). Cooke, later elected FSA in 1876, displays here some of his own interests such as botany and zoology. In about 1835 Cooke was visiting antique dealers in Wardour Street with his friend and the watercolourist Thomas Cromek, selecting items to be included in this picture. In May 1835 he made colour sketches of his room, borrowing china jars from his neighbours, and, according to his diary, 'went to several Jews shops and bought silk for my old chair'; on 28 May, 'to Town ... I took up old pictures and old clothes, made exchanges with Jews in Princes St for China Jar, Carvings, Helmet &c'. He also records Sheepshanks inspecting the progress of the painting. \n\nWainwright has suggested that Cooke based his idea on the description of Jonathan Oldbuck's study in Sir Walter Scott's novel <i>The Antiquary</i> first published in 1816, a room 'obscurely lighted ... a chaos of maps, engravings, scraps of parchments, bundles of papers, pieces of old armour \u2026the floor as well as the table and chairs was overflowed by the same mare magnum of miscellaneous trumpery'. As Wainwright comments, it is 'a dreadful warning of how collections can take over the lives of their creators ... Cooke's painting depicts the centre of Old buck's study and portrays in great detail the chaos of a collection already out of control'. \n\nThere is a watercolour study for the centre of the painting in the V&A collections, and a study of armour possibly also related, both from the Sheepshanks Gift (FA105 and 107). For a similar antiquarian interior, see under William Fettes Douglas, 'The Alchemist', 67 -1873, p71. \n\nEXH: BI 1836 (24); <i>Edward William Cooke</i> Guildhall Art Gallery 1970 (131) \n\nLIT: <i>Connoisseur</i> January 1977, pi (detail repr in colour on cover); C Wainwright 'Myth and Reality: Sir Waiter Scott and his Collection-l' <i>Country Life</i> 16 September 1982, p806 (repr fig 6); C Wainwright <i>The Romantic Interior in England</i> 1750-1850 (1989)\"",
