The raw silk is blotch dyed in shades of pale and deep blue with some red to pink.  From the right shoulder, across the bust to over the waist and following the curve of the outer skirt front, terminating at the hem on the left on the same line as it began at the shoulder, is a linked line of variously sized stylized 'leaf' motifs in felt, roughly painted silver with touches of purple; each leaf is outlined in narrow tubular crin, the inner edge of which is outlined in black; inserted into some of the 'fronds' are lines of graduated decorative blue studs.  The bodice is lined with white cotton and has bust forms, the skirt with white raw silk; at the hips is a short tulle underskirt.  The dress fastens down the back with hooks and eyes.\n[Theatre costume] Stiff, open fan shape on handle covered with raw silk blotch dyed pale and dark blue, and pink with a central red blotch.
