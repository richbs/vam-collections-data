Hand-knitted vests date back to the 17th century and frame-knitted versions became available in the late 18th century.  Power operated knitting machines greatly increased production, allowing for a wider variety of garments at cheaper prices.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe advancement in knitting design modelled by this knitwear manufacturer is the narrowing of the sleeve from elbow to wrist.  Normally sleeves were worked as tubes of the same diameter from shoulder to wrist. The innovation offered here would prevent the bunching of the vest under the sleeve.\n\nHistorical Associations\nKnitwear was a booming British industry and an important representation at the Great Exhibition in 1851. In all media, one of the great strengths of the Exhibition was its liberal attitude to both machine and hand-made objects. Each method had its advantages and beauties. The Juries reporting on the Exhibition considered machine knitting particularly significant. They were aware of its economic importance and very concerned that Britain keep pace with technological advancement.",
