A painter and muralist, Mukherjee, studied at Santiniketan under the tutelage of Bengal School artist Nandalal Bose. He developed a style that drew from a variety of artistic forms, including western modernism, Far Eastern calligraphy and wash technique, Indian Rajput and Mughal paintings and the Ajanta and Bagh frescoes. \n\nNear the end of his career, the artist suffered from poor eyesight. He was blind when he made this print, which shows his experimentation with form, rhythm and space. In this print Muherjee gives us a contemporary interpretation of elements of traditional Hindu iconography. The trident, snake and eye identify the Hindu god Shiva. While he imagined the colours, the shapes are felt and arranged. The printing was done by Somnath Hore, another of India\u2019s most prominent artists.",

            "historical_context_note": "Binode Behari Mukherjee (1904 - 1980) was one of the pioneers and leading exponents of the Indian Modernist movement. A painter and muralist, Mukherjee, studied at Santiniketan under the tutelage of Bengal School artist Nandalal Bose. He developed a style that drew from a variety of artistic forms, including western modernism, Far Eastern calligraphy and wash technique, Indian Rajput and Mughal paintings and the Ajanta and Bagh frescoes. \n\nWhilst at Santiniketan, Mukherjee was one of the first students to use oil paint and work in a multitude of media including woodcuts, murals, etching and collage. He learnt calligraphy and traditional Far Eastern wash techniques from visiting Japanese artists. In 1936 he travelled to Japan and was influenced by the abstract compositions of painter Tawaraya Sotatsu. His interest in Western modernism is evidenced by his flexible adoption of a Cubist non-figurative syntax such as multi-perspectival compositions and faceting of planes.  In addition, Mukherjee was inspired by the Ajanta and Bagh frescoes which triggered his interest in mural techniques. \u2018Saint Singers of Medieval India\u2019, commissioned by the Visva-Bharati University in 1947 is one such experiment.\n\nMukherjee taught at Kala Bhavan (1925-1949), the art faculty of Visva Bharati University. In 1947, he joined as a curator the Nepal Government Museum in Kathmandu and from 1951-52, he taught at the Banasthalo Vidyapith School in Rajasthan. In 1958, completely blind, he returned to Kala Bhavan and became its principal.",
