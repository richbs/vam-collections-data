Hand-held mirrors of this period typically formed part of a ladies' dressing table set which included brushes, combs, pots for powder and perfume, and a tray.\n\nDesign & Designing\nFrancis George Wood, the designer of this piece, attended the Salford School of Art. This was one of a network of local art schools that had began to spring up around the country from the 1850s onwards.  The schools provided training for artists and designers with the intention of improving the quality of design of manufactured goods. The syllabuses offered by the schools were strictly set out and focused on drawing skills and techniques.  Students graduated through the various stages of drawing, mastering subjects from nature such as flowers and foliage before moving on to the human figure.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nDaffodils were a popular decorative motif at this time and appeared on wallpaper and fabric designs as well as on small domestic objects. In the 1890s Arthur Wilcock designed a 'Daffodils and Crocus' chintz for Liberty's as part of its range of Art Nouveau-inspired fabrics. The ornament of intertwining stems and leaves shows the influence of the graphic style of the Arts and Crafts designer Walter Crane (1845-1915), as well as continental Art Nouveau.",
