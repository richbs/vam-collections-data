            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nThe term 'miniature' is a description of a watercolour technique rather than the size of a painting. So although this painting may seem quite large, it is a miniature because it is painted in watercolour on vellum (fine animal skin).  Such large miniatures are today called 'cabinet miniatures'.  This is a recent term for miniatures that would have been kept in a cupboard or  a room hung with other small paintings. Both spaces were then called 'cabinets'.\n\nThis miniature is in a frame with locking doors that was made for it by a former owner, the auctioneer John Sotheby (1740-1807).\n\nSubjects Depicted\nSir Thomas More (1478-1535) was Lord Chancellor of England and also a distinguished scholar. In the picture he is seated beside his father, Sir John More. Behind him is his son John, holding a prayer book, and John's wife, Anne Cresacre. The three women in low-cut dresses in the centre are his daughters Cecily Heron (seated, with a closed book), Elizabeth Dauncey (standing) and Margaret Roper (seated, with an open book).  The four figures  with pleated ruffs are his grandson, also called Thomas More, with his wife Maria Scrope and their sons, John and Christopher Cresacre More. His 'fool' can be seen pushing through the curtain. \n\nThis is a sort of visual family tree. In fact, the four generations could not have sat together for the portrait. \n\nAttribution\nThe attribution of the miniature to  Rowland Lockey is linked to large oil version of this painting that is signed by him.  We know that Lockey was an apprentice of  Nicholas Hilliard (?1547-1619) and also practised as a miniaturist, so this miniature is likely to be by Lockey.",

The figure in the background lifting the curtain is the More family jester, Henry Patenson.\n\nThe miniature depicting Sir Thomas More, his family and descendants is a unique visual document which can only be understood be reference to the original Holbein painting of Sir Thomas and his family and to other paintings connected with it, commissioned at the same time as the miniature by Thomas More II in the late Elizabethan period.  The most complete discussions of this are in S. Morison and N. Barker, <i>The Likeness of Thomas More</i>, London, 1963, pp. 18 ff. and Strong, <i>Tudor and Jacobean</i>, I, pp. 345-51 and what follows is based on those accounts with an emphasis on this miniature.\n\nOne of Holbein\u2019s earliest commissions when he arrived in England in 1527 was the famous, lost, Family Group of the More family.  It was executed in the fragile medium of distemper and is known to us best by Holbein\u2019s sketch sent to Erasmus as an interim report before the picture was finished in 1528.  The picture was presumably confiscated along with More\u2019s other chattels on his fall from power and we next hear of it in the possession of the Holbein collector, Andreas de Loo.  He died in 1590 and Van Mander records that it passed to a nephew of Sir Thomas More who was also called More.  This must have been More\u2019s grandson, Thomas More II.  It is next recorded in the collection of Thomas Howard, Earl of Arundel, to whom it may have been passed by way of John, 1st Lord Lumley, the Elizabethan collector who was also a Catholic.\n\nAlbeit that the history of its early descent is patchy there is not doubt that it belonged to Thomas More II in the 1590s and that it was he and his relatives who probably commissioned Rowland Lockey to execute three paintings: (i) the life-size copy of the picture as it was which, signed by Rowland Lockey, is not in the collection of Lord St. Oswald.  This descended via the Ropers who would have commissioned the copy.  It has recently been cleaning revealing the date, 1592; (ii) a second life-size copy of the picture which introduced, to the right, Sir Thomas\u2019s descendants and which, bearing the date 1593, is now in the National Portrait Gallery (2765).  This we know was painted for Thomas More II and passed to his surviving son, Cresacre; (ii) the miniature version of (ii) but again with further slight variants, in particular, the introduction of a view of a garden through an arch to the right.\n\nThe miniature seems to have been in the possession of a More descendent before it entered the Sotheby collection and its portrait content establishes that it must have originated directly with Thomas More II.  In date it must be slightly later than the oil version in the National Portrait Gallery because here Cresacre is shown clean shaven whereas he has a slight beard and moustache in the miniature.  This would suggest a date about 1594. \n\nThomas More II married Mary Scrope, the niece of Lord Scrope of Bolton, in 1553.  They lived on the Cresacre estates in Yorkshire until they moved south early in the 1580s, taking up residence on their Essex estate at Lower Leyton.  From 1582 to 1586 Thomas More II was imprisoned for recusancy, after his release the More family continued to live quietly as recusants in the country (see D. Shanahan, \u201cThe Family of St. Thomas More in Essex\u201d, <i>Essex Recusant</i>, I, pp. 62-74; 95-104; II, pp. 76-85).\n\nBoth large-scale picture and miniature transmute what Holbein had conceived with daring originality as the first family conversation piece north of the Alps, into a genealogical family tree brought to life, accentuated by the introduction of coats of arms.  In the miniature these float before the canopy over the buffet and, although, on a minute scale and damaged, recording (left) those of More (Quarterly; 1 and 4 Argent a Chevron engrailed between three Moorcocks Sable crested Gules; 2 and 3, Argent on a Chevron between three Unicorns\u2019 Heads erased Sable as many Bezants) and (right) those of Cresacre (of three Lions rampant guardant Gules) quartering those of More.\n\nThe main difference from the large version is the dropping of the portrait of Anne Cresacre on the right in favour of a garden view, which Vertue states, was More\u2019s Chelsea garden.  The panorama in the distance certainly seems to be London with Old St Paul\u2019s in the centre, but it is difficult to know what sources existed c. 1593-94 that could possibly provide an accurate view of Sir Thomas More\u2019s celebrated Chelsea garden half a century earlier: \u201cA portion of this garden was left to the care of each of the many servants\u2026He would have no idle retainer in his service\u2026they were expected to occupy their leisure with gardening, music or books\u201d (see Miles Hadfield, <i>A History of British Gardening</i>, 3rd revised ed., London, 1979, pp. 38-39).  All one can say is that it is a rare view of a Tudor garden, enclosed by walls with a banqueting house in one corner and the centre laid out in knots surrounded by low clipped hedges.\n\nThe attribution of the miniature follows from the documentation of the large group being by Lockey and our knowledge that he was a pupil of Hilliard and practised as a miniaturist.  This group must be the cornerstone for any further attributions to him.  It does establish Lockey as an artist who never rose much above being a mediocre follower of the Hilliard manner.\n\nThe miniature is in the frame that was made for it on it s acquisition by the Sotheby family in 1715.  The features have flaked and been restored.  There is scattered flaking both in the background and the landscape.  The paint surface is generally soiled by ingrained dirt and the silver has oxidized.\n\nINSCRIBED: Across the top in gold: <i>A Johanes Morus eques auratus et iudex; B. Tho. Mors eques aur. Dns.
