In 1888 he became a publisher in his own right with offices at 24 St. Bride Street, London. He appointed the writer and editor, Robert Ellice Mack, as director. \n\nNister specialised in high quality colour printing for children in the last quarter of the 19th century. Movable books with various mechanisms became his speciality after 1890 (when be published his first stand-up book) but he also produced numerous picture books, annuals, poetry, nursery rhymes, calendars and greetings cards. He worked with a core of writers, including Clifton Bingham and Robert Ellice Mack, and illustrators, in particular Eveline Lance, Harriett M. Bennett, Edith A. Cubitt and Rosa Petherick. \n\nThis illustration was published by Nister in his 'untearable' book, Nursery Rhymes and Pictures (no. 870a), printed in Bavaria and published in New York by E. P. Dutton & Co.  This illustration also appears as the frontispiece of Happy Children and their Pets, published in London by Ernest Nister and in New York by E. P. Dutton & Co. (Happy Children Series no. 3106.)  It illustrates the popular nursery rhyme:\n\nMary had a little lamb,\nIts fleece was white as snow;\nAnd everywhere that Mary went,\nThe lamb was sure to go.\nHe followed her to school one day,\nThat was against the rule;\nIt made the children laugh and play,\nTo see a lamb at school.\nAnd so the teacher turned it out,\nBut still it lingered near,\nAnd waited patiently about\nTill Mary did appear.\n\"Why does the lamb love Mary so?\"\nThe eager children cry;\n\"Why, Mary loves the lamb, you know,\"\nThe teacher did reply.",
