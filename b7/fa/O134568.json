The sturdy ionic pillars were a feature of the theatre designed by the architect Benjamin Wyatt which opened in October 1812.  This was the fourth Drury Lane Theatre on the same site since the original 1663 building was destroyed by fire in 1772; the 1774 building was demolished in 1791 because it was too small, and the 1794 building was again destroyed by fire in 1809.\n\nThe artist Peter Bax worked at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane as a stage manager and a stage designer before moving to the British Broadcasting Company as a Studio Manager in 1934.  He was one of the original team of people, several of which were recruited for their theatre backgrounds, to be appointed by the BBC to start preparations for high-resolution broadcasting.  After the war he became the Artistic Director at Alexandra Palace, the home of  BBC television after1936.",
