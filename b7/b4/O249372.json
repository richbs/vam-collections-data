Eleven brass keys, with prettily shaped levers sunk into deep grooves cut in the wood, and pivoted on brass pins. The round key-plates, with flat leather pads, are riveted to the ends of the levers. There are two thumb keys on the wing joint; four keys on the front of the butt (B flat, F, A flat, and a duplicate F sharp key with a touch which overlaps the lower part of the F touch as on a modern German bassoon); an F sharp key on the back of the butt; and on the long joint, in which is an ivory-bushed C hole, keys for low D and B flat and also, for the little finger, keys for E flat and C sharp (low). The bore narrows a little towards the rim of the bell.
