The partial inscription, HENRY GRAC SHE, is probably a contracted version of Henry Grace Cavendishe.  It is part of a collection of needlework known as the Oxburgh hangings.  They were made between 1570 and about 1585, the work of Mary during her imprisonment in England and Bess whose husband George Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury was responsible for Mary while she stayed at one or other of the Shrewsbury estates.  Henry Cavendish was Bess's second husband.  \n\nThis panel of canvas work (stitching over the threads of a coarsely woven linen) is embroidered in coloured silks, silver and silver-gilt thread.  Not all the panels were done by Mary and Bess, as household accounts show that both had professional embroiderers on staff.   The existing \u2018hangings\u2019 consist of a of wall hanging, two bed curtains and valance, on permanent long-term loan at Oxburgh Hall in Norfolk.  However these were probably not the original arrangement of the embroidery, but sewn together in the late 17th century.  This group of 33 embroideries are the remains of another hanging, now unpicked.",
