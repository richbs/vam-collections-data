On a more practical level, although a white garment showed dirt and stains more readily than a dark coloured one, it had an advantage in being more easily washed, boiled, or bleached. Good quality coloured fabrics were often more expensive; the colours might fade, and some dyes were even poisonous, particularly green, which sometimes contained arsenic.",
