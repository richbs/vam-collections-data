The beads, striped pink and purple, have a long undulating shape and swell towards the middle with alternate centres of yellow and blue. The drops, which at the front are pointed and have reflective panels inset, are mostly of clear acrylic but at certain angles are suffused with colour from a thin layer of pink, orange or purple acrylic towards the front. Where the drops extend upwards to join the necklace the acrylic darkens and is decorated with green spots. A white spot on the back of one of the drops marks the top of the necklace which would be at the back of the neck when worn.",

His original and complex work is both technically innovative and visually exciting. Of the extraordinary way in which colour permeates his jewellery he has written 'By laminating and forming, carving and refining, I blend colours to form my own palette, seeking subtleties of newly enriched hues' (Jerwood Applied Arts Prize 2007 Jewellery, Catalogue page 50). The lustrous forms he creates - with their pools of clear acrylic, their embedded mirrors and their layers of wild psychedelic colour - achieve surprising optical effects as the light is captured by or projected through the glowing spheres.",
