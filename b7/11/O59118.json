            "history_note": "The print shows a scene from Leonide Massine's ballet Les Matelots, designed by Pedro Pruna, music by Georges Auric, produced by Diaghilev Ballets Russes in 1925.  A sailor becomes engaged to a girl before setting off with his shipmates on a voyage; on the sailors disguise themselves to test the girl's fidelity, but, despite the entreaties of her friend to meet the sailors, she remains true to her fianc\u00e9.  \n\nBy the mid 1920s, there was an increasing interest in the Diaghilev Ballet and material relating to dance in general.  Beaumont had already produced a series of booklets on individual Diaghilev Ballets under the series title Impressions of the Russian Ballet and a number of wooden cut-out Diaghilev dancers in their famous roles.  He now decided to produce a series of hand coloured prints of typical scenes from the Diaghilev Ballet repertory.   He kept no records of when he began publishing the prints nor how many were produced, although he reckoned about twenty, mostly the work of Adrian Allinson, Ethelbert White and Randolf Schwabe who had also worked on Impressions of the Russian Ballet booklets and the wooden figures, and Eileen Mayo.  \nIn all these works, Beaumont strove to capture the exact moments of the ballet as well as artists' interpretations.  Possibly the design of each print followed the painstaking search for accuracy that had characterised the creation of the illustrations for Impressions of the Russian Ballet series, described in Bookseller at the Ballet - choosing the significant moment, watching the ballet night after night to check details of the poses and grouping (not easy when the stage was full of individual dancers and movement), going backstage to sketch scenery and borrow costumes - although some prints appear to be 'composite' rather than specific tableaux.  \nMost of the hand-colouring for Impressions of the Russian Ballet booklets was the work of Beaumont and his wife, Alice, and it is possible that both were also involved in colouring the prints, although eventually other artists were employed on both projects.\n\nHistorical significance: Although the link is tenuous, the ballet was the forerunner of the 1940s works dealing with the activities of sailors on shore leave - Jerome Robbins' Fancy Free which was itself the inspiration for the musical and subsequent film On the Town.",
