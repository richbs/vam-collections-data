The disc is decorated on the front with a band of repousse curls round the centre, and a ring of dots round the edge, which is scalloped to fit the dots.  There are four holes in the edge.  The two at the top have loose suspension rings threaded through them, and the two at the bottom have suspension rings supporting a thin curved strip of silver, which hangs round the lower edge of the disc.  This strip of silver has five pendants hanging from it: a central facetted yellow paste, between two similar blue pastes, with a silver disc with domed surface at each end.  The disc appears to have been cut down from something larger, as the pattern on the rim has been cut through at four regular points on its edge.  \n[crescent] Chain of silver-gilt filigree links.  Each link consists of an oval of ribbon wire, with matted decoration on the outside, filled with a double coil of flattened twisted wire.

It is possible that it had been used as a necklace, but it is not typical of the kind of jewellery worn with any Greek costume, and has been put together from a number of different pieces.  It may have been constructed for sale to tourists.\n\nThe two main sections, the crescent shape and the disc below it, were probably originally tepelikia.  These were decorative discs which were each sewn to the top of a little cap, like a fez.  They were worn by women throughout the territories of the former Ottoman Empire.  \n\nThe complete object was bought for \u00a32 15s at the International Exhibition, London, 1872.",
