Working within the mainstream market for precious jewellery, they experimented with contemporary designs and materials. They explored new methods of applying gold and devised abstract designs and unconventional shapes for settings.\n \nFor women in high society this jewellery offered a new way of expressing wealth and status. What counted was creative expression and individuality, not big flashy stones and material values. Diamonds were no longer the only gemstone to be a 'girl's best friend'.\n\nDavid Thomas worked for the Swedish Crown jewellers Bolin and later in 1959 studied at the Royal College of Art, London. In 1961 he opened his own studio and in that year showed his work in the groundbreaking International Exhibition of Modern Jewellery at Goldsmiths' Hall. His jewellery has been exhibited worldwide.\n\nThese earrings are typical of his early work, when his designs often included wire structures. Wire shapes swirl around a cluster of small diamonds, and the swerving lines express movement.",
