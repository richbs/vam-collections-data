A lithograph is a picture made by printing from a flat surface (traditionally stone, now often a metal plate), on which the artist draws or paints the original design with a greasy substance like chalk. The surface is next prepared, moistened and inked; the greasy printing ink adheres to the design, which is then printed onto a sheet of paper. For a colour lithograph, a separate surface is required for each colour.\n\n\nThe poster is 6-sheet format. British poster dimensions were based on the double-crown sheet unit which measures 30 by 20 inches. Since this poster measures roughly 90 x 40 inches, its size equals 6 double-crown sheets. Standardisation of sizes (4-sheet, 6-sheet, 8-sheet, 16-sheet, etc.) meant that bill posters could paste posters on the hoardings in modular fashion. \n\n\n\nSubjects Depicted\n\nThe point of this poster is to advertise Colman's Mustard:  the name of the product is spelt out in bold so that it can be read at a distance. The artist, John Hassall, cleverly illustrates both the product itself (seen in the packet on the fire), and its usage (shown by the huddled figure of an exhausted gold prospector). Mustard baths are traditionally made by mixing a spoonful or two of roughly-milled mustard into a foot-bath of hot water; the effects are notably warming and relaxing.\n\n\n\nTime\n\nThe poster makes capital out of a current event - the Klondike Gold Rush. Gold was discovered in the valley of the Klondike River, in the Yukon territory of north-western Canada, in 1896, and hopeful prospectors rushed to the scene. After a few years, the gold petered out and many adventurers returned home disappointed.\n\n",
