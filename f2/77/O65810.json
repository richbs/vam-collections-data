By this time, the conventional Principal Boy costume, with the exaggerated hour-glass figure and padded thighs had given way to the simpler, unstructured lines of the 1920s, and this costume worn by Bay Harrington is a rare survivor of the style. By the 1930s, the fashion of the 'aristocratic' Principal Boy had changed to an 18th century coat and breeches. \n \nMany theatrical performers of this period made their own costumes - it was a time when most women had been taught dressmaking - but Bay Harrington was fortunate to come from a family of tailors, which accounts for the excellent finish and style of her costumes.  The tights, in shiny ivory silk jersey, would have emphasised her legs in the 19th century tradition.\n\nBay (a corruption of 'Baby', the name by which she was known to her family in which she was the only girl) trained at the Tree Academy as an opera singer and appeared in performances at Covent Garden and at Her Majesty's Theatre. She had the opportunity of continuing her singing studies at La Scala, but her family felt she was too young, and after a bout of TB affected her voice she abandoned grand opera for the variety stage, appearing with concert groups including The Seven Romps in1912 and then in various double acts with other girls including The Trilbies with Eileen Lawler in 1913, touring the Near East and Asia as well as Britain, and with Evelyn Kirkby as Kirkby & Harrington.  She appeared in pantomime in London and the regions as well as in variety.",

It would have been worn in the finale 'walk down' when the principals take their individual calls.\n\nHistorical significance: The costume is for an aristocratic Principal Boy (such as the Prince in Cinderella) of the post 1915-early 1920s.   It shows the transitional stage between the heavily boned, stylized costumes of the late 19th century, of which the Museum possesses a superb example in S.1351/B-1984, and the 18th century-based style which became traditional for princely principal boys in the 1930s.",
