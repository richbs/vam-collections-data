Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nOver The Moon, a musical by Vivian Ellis, opened at the New Theatre on 3 March 1953 and ran for two weeks, starring Cicely Courtneidge, with dances choreographed by Jack Hulbert. The programme credits 'Bob Probst and His Orchestra'. For some time in the 1950s and 1960s Robert Probst was the pianist and orchestral conductor at the Wimbledon Theatre.",
