It shows a series of scenes and leading performers, amongst them Mrs Lily Langtry (1853-1929) and Mr. Lewis Waller (1860-1915), from a production of Mademoiselle Mars at The Imperial Theatre in 1902. \n\nThe sketch is not dated but has been signed by the artist F.V.Poole in the bottom right hand corner. \n\nThis item is one of several theatrical drawings from a collection of sketches commissioned from contemporary artists to be printed in illustrated magazines. The collection was donated to the museum by Sir William James Ingram in 1914.",
