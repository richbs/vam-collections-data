First studied medicine, then travelled extensively, (supposedly on foot) on the continent 1843-45, settling in Rome where he took up painting, influenced by the work of Giovanni Costa. Returned to England 1858, marrying and settling at the family seat of Wetley Abbey. Visited Paris with Costa 1863. Exhibited 25 works at the RA between 1857 and 1872, and 12 elsewhere, Italian and English landscapes with an idyllic atmosphere and effects of mist and twilight which were both admired and influential. Moved to Hammersmith, London 1864, where he died 22 October 1872. An exhibition of his work was at Christie's 15 February 1873. His portrait by Val Prinsep is in the NPG. \nLIT: \tSir J F White 'The Pictures of the late George Mason, ARA', Contemporary Review April 1873, pp724-36; 'Holland and Mason' The Architect 27 December 1879, pp378-80; Alice Meynell 'George Mason' Art Journal 1883, pp43-5, 108-11, 185-8; H Quilter Pinwell and Mason Royal Society of British Artists exhibition catalogue 1895; A Chester 'The Art of George Heming Mason, ARA' Windsor Magazine (32), 1910, pp491-504; R Haggar The Masons of Lane Delph 1952; R Billingham Life and Work of George Mason unpublished thesis, University of Leicester 1975; S Reynolds 'George Heming Mason and the Idealised Landscape' Apollo February 1981, pp 106-9; R Billingham George Heming Mason exhibition catalogue Museum and Art Gallery, Stoke-on- Trent, 1982 \n\nA Country Wedding\n310-1887 Neg HF979 \nCanvas, 10.2 \u00d7 23.5 cm (4 \u00d7 91/4 ins) \nPurchased 1887 \nA painting of the same title was bought by Leighton for \u00a373 l0s at Mason's studio sale in 1873 (see 309-1887 above); sold in Leighton's studio sale 1896. \nPROV: Purchased by the Museum for Mrs Mary Mason, the artist's widow, \n1887 \nEXH: \tArt Exhibition Wedgwood Institute, Burslem, 1879 (91, lent by Mrs Mason); George Heming Mason City Museum and Art Gallery, Stoke-on-Trent, 1982 (39, as on paper and dated to about 1865) \n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
