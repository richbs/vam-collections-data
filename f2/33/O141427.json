Most theatres in the19th century produced them to mark grand openings or milestone performances. By the end of the First World War however the practice generally died out, only being revived very occasionally,  more often at London's opera houses than any other theatres.\n\nThis silk playbill was produced to mark the 90th performance of The Winter's Tale at The Royal Lyceum Theatre, near The Strand, starring Johnston Forbes-Robertson as Leontes and the beautiful American actress Mary Anderson as Hermione and Perdita. Henry Irving, who had been the lessee of  the Lyceum Theatre since December 1878 and its greatest star, was on tour in America with Ellen Terry in the winter of 1887, but Forbes-Robertson had played many leading roles with Irving, and Mary Anderson had played Juliet at the Lyceum in 1884 when Irving and his leading lady Ellen Terry were away on another tour.",
