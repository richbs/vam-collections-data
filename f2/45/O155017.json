The action centres around the ritual celebration of fertility and is a blend of the present with the timeless.   If Tippett's visionary opera is to work, it has to be rooted in reality and in this production the costumes were an important element in creating the right context for the audience's imagination.   \n Throughout Stubbs used colour to suggest the progress of the trials undergone by the young people in the course of the opera. The bright, lush green in this design suggested fertility and was in deliberate in contrast to the silvery greys used for the Ancients (see S.1141-1982). \nThe design is not a clear blueprint for making the costume, but rather an imaginative suggestion of what the finished dress should look like.  With such indefinite, but impressionistic designs, the makers work closely with the designer to realise the concept.",
