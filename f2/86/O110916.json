The gilding on the interior helps to protect the silver from being corroded by the acid in the wine. Its accompanying paten or communion plate (Museum no. M.22A-1968) would have held the bread. \n\nAlfred Charles Pruden (1906-1974) designed and made the set as a commission. He changed his name to Dunstan Pruden when he was received into the Roman Catholic Church and saw his work as an expression of his religious beliefs. He started his career in a shared London workshop but moved to Ditchling in East Sussex to join the Roman Catholic craft community, The Guild of St. Joseph and St. Dominic, established by the sculptor Eric Gill in 1921.",

Ashbee, initiated a decisive shift towards fine craftsmanship in church silver. This led to a sharp fall in the standing of commercial manufacturers but provided a steady source of work for many designer-silversmiths that has lasted into the present day. This revival of craftsmanship came out of the Arts and Crafts movement, one of the greatest social and artistic forces of the age. Favouring small studio workshops and simplicity of form, the movement set the pattern for church silver throughout the 20th century, whether for major cathedral commissions or for parish churches.
