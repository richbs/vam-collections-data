The French Revolutionary government closed this church in 1791, and it was demolished in 1840. We do not know what happened to the large window to which these panels belonged. \n\nThe two panels were linked to Saint-Nicholas by Jean Lafond, who was a renowned French expert in stained glass. He discovered drawings dating from the early 18th century that recorded the window in this church.\n\nThe details in the drawings are sketchy and do not match the V&A panels precisely, but the coat of arms displayed on the panels do correspond to those on the drawings. In this panel we see a woman with her children in the bottom right, along with her family coat of arms impaled with that of her husband's. (The arms of her husband appear in the Annunciation panel.  A cherub holds the shield of arms. The husband's are those on the left-hand side and the wife's are on the right-hand side.",
