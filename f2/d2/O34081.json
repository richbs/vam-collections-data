The entire doll is painted black, with a military or livery uniform indicated by a red-painted collar, belt, cuffs, buttons and stockings; the hands are clenched as though for marching and the feet are carved as heeled boots.  The operator holds the rod which fits into the hole in the doll's back, and stands the doll on a board which he or she taps to make it vibrate: this causes the doll's jointed limbs move.  This is the same principle as the Dancing Tommy.\n[Doll's clothing] white stockinette vest\nwhite cotton drawers and petticoat\nred and white gingham dress and bandana; dress has back fastening with press studs and hook and loop\nwhite cotton apron and fichu; apron trimmed with red cross stitch\nbrass ring earrings\nThe doll was dressed in the 1970s by the donor's mother while she was a student at the Stanhope Institute's Creative Embroidery class.",
