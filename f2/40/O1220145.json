The company introduced Daks trousers in 1934, which eliminated the need for braces or suspenders. Daks became known for sportswear based on the founder\u2019s philosophy of \u2018comfort in action\u2019 for men, using mainly British fabrics. In the late 1970s Daks-Simpson Ltd opened a riding and country shop on the 5th floor of their Piccadilly shop, and subsequently extended these themes into their fashion collections. For their 1996 \u2018DAKS Salutes the Horse\u2019 range, they invited Henry Poole & Co to use riding attire as inspiration for their clothing designs. Based on the hacking jacket, this garment is made in a 13-ounce District check tweed. It flares over the hips and features the distinctive centre-back vent. In keeping with the company tradition of using British fabrics, Poole employs a traditional tweed.",
