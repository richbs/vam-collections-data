It was created in 1972 by a designer called Allison Katzman and marketed in the USA by the toy company, Kenner whilst being manufactured in Hong Kong. The dolls were only on the market for a year because of a lack of interest in the product, meaning that not many were produced. However, the product was reintroduced 27 years later after CWC in Japan made a TV commercial staring Blythe. She immediately became a sensation and was popular in Japan and Asia with a huge quantity of merchandise to accompany  the dolls revival. \n\nModern reproductions have been made by Hasbro, who bought out Kenner in 1970 and Takara since 2001 and by Ashton Drake since 2004. This particular doll is one of the original dolls made in 1972 by Kenner.",
