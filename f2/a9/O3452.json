For all purposes, a clear glass was chosen for the low expansion and an opal glass for the higher expansion core.   The difference in expansion between the skin and the core causes a strain to develop in cooling from the set point of the glasses to room temperature.  This strain results in a surface compression and a central tension giving in effect a pre-stressed article which will resiost breakage more than a tempered or an annealed product. In addition a mild temper has been super-imposed on this stress pattern in order to have a deeper compression layer to better resist deep surface damage that occurs during use. See 0086 (C.217-1985).  This example, an 'in-house' design is in 'Heather' colours."
