Men often wore these in extravagant quantities with traditional costume, at their collars and cuffs, as well as to fasten shirts, jackets, and waistcoats.  \n\nThis pair of buttons was probably worn to hold the neck of the shirt closed.  The use of buttons as collar links precedes their use in fastening clothes in most European countries, and the buttons used in this way come in many patterns.  These buttons, with a flat sheet silver back, scalloped round the edge, and an open filigree front, are now considered typical of Salamanca, but they were made and worn throughout Spain in the 19th century.  Unlike in many other countries, both men and women wore silver buttons in Spain.  These were described as from Cordoba, when they were bought for the museum by Se\u00f1or Ria\u00f1o for two shillings and one penny (the pair) in 1871.",
