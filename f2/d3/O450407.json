He sits in the centre of a colonade with four columns with four annular rings each, with a female attendant on his left holding  flywhisk.  A further two bejewlled females figures stand within the niches created by the outer columns. On the right hand side there is a jawless <i>kirttimukka</i> with bulging round eyes and a foliate scroll curling up from his mouth over his head on the left hand side: the other side of which has been broken off. The architrave and base of the colonade have decorative curlicues carved into the flat planes of the mouldings.",
