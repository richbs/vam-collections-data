AD300-700 (probably) and sandal ca. 30BC-AD300 (probably).\n[Shoe] A flat shoe of dark leather with over sandal of brown plaited leather. Round toe and round heel. Turned technique with rand (4mm). It is believed the sandal has been attached at a later date and does not belong with the shoe. The pair to the sandal is 843A-1903 and the pair to the shoe is 843B-1903. One nail remains. Shoe sole: Straight, probably worn Right. Lateral treadsole missing and hole at seat, suggesting wear. Forepart and worn. Two punched holes in seat. Sandal sole: Sandal has its own treadsole and midsole (only the waist to sole remains). It is now detached from the shoe sole. Insole displays same geometric incised decoration as 843A-1903. Shoe upper: Dark leather with some red leather remaining on the vamp and topband, lateral quarter. Row of square, openwork threaded with leather below topband and a row of running stitch below this. The vamp has punched holes around toes and two rows of square, openwork revealing a layer of white (?) leather, surrounding a circular medallion of red leather stitched on with cross stitch. The heel has one vertical row of square, openwork and stitching either side of backseam. Inside, at heel, a separate piece of semi-circular black leather has been sewn with whip stitch. Covers area over backseam so can\u2019t see stitching. Sandal upper: The plaits of the sandal cover the medallion. Backstrap of 14 strips of plaited leather and a toestrap of one strip of thicker, plaited leather. The backstrap pieces are held together by four thin strips of leather sewn across the 14 pieces (two evenly spaced over each vamp wing.) One of these strips (left vamp wing) holds the sandal to the shoe. The toestrap has a central row, down vamp, of three circles made of strips of curled leather with an X scored into each. The backstrap is attached to the sandal treadsole/midsole and the ends protrude through this treadsole. \n[Over sandal] A brown leather, flat sandal. Pointed toe and round heel. Treadsole: Straight. Appears to be a midsole from waist to seat. The plait ends of the backstrap protrude through the sole at the seat. Some nails still remain at perimeter. Insole: Elaborately decorated with incised designs using lines, cross-hatching, circles and at the heel, a flower of seven petals. Leather is worn down at big toe and centre of tread. Straps: The toestrap is of plaited leather. The backstrap is of 12 strips of plaited leather, held together by four thin strips of leather sewn across the 12 plaits, two evenly spaced over each vamp wing. Three circles run down the central line of the strap. They are made of strips of curled leather and each is scored with an X.  Some of the plait straps are threaded through the back of each circle.",
