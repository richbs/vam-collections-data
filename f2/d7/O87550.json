It is double-breasted, fastening with white metal buttons to either the left or right. Although the pockets are decorated with applied braid, it is the neckline that received the greatest decoration. Two curving bands of black velvet have been applied to the felt and then decorated with cords and sequins, each held in place with a glass bead. Above and below the lower band is a series of lines worked in fine chain stitch. These red bands are slightly wider on the left-hand panel. Below them are lines of metal and silk braid and pink and yellow chenille--a tufted, furry yarn named after the French word for a caterpillar. Below these is an applied metal braid with more sequins.  The fine coloured lines set against the black velvet create a restrained and elegant effect.",
