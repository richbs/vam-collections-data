The water in the kettle was heated by a small burner beneath. Having the kettle in the room in front of guests highlighted the polite ceremonial nature of the tea-making process. This stand is of a particularly high quality.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe stand is finely carved, with a pierced gallery around an octagonal top. The supporting stem is fluted, or cut in grooves,  with the knob below carved with spiral grooves.  The tripod legs are carved with acanthus leaves and end in scrolled feet. The pierced gallery and curved legs were fashionable design features of the 1760s. A design similar to this stand appeared in The Universal System of Household Furniture by William Ince and John Mayhew, published in 1762.  However, the person who designed or made this stand is not known.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe use of  mahogany, expensively carved, shows the attention and expenditure which was devoted to furniture used for serving tea.",
