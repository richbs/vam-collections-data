Platinum, much less yielding than copper, has been explored by Susan Cross, in abstract filigree and crochet respectively. Cross's jewellery has evolved from the crocheted precision of this early example into a more spontaneous tangling of metal fibres, exploring the boundaries of textiles and metals.\n\nSusan Cross likes to work with gold and silver wires intuitively. The outcome is a pliable transparent structure with a tactile feel. The interaction of her jewellery with the body is important to her. She uses oxidised silver for grapic outlines adding braiding, binding and wrapping to her repertoire and non-precious materials for colour. \n\nSusan Cross is based in Edinburgh since 1989, and was the joint winner of the Jerwood Applied Arts Prize in 2007.",
