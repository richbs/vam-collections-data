The pattern is comprised of bursting pomegranates, buildings and trees on a textured silver ground. The buildings and trees are out of proportion relative to the fruit. The pattern is a point repeat and in the centre there is a group  of three pomegranates. Below them a tree in blue behind a balustrade. The ground warp is green silk organzine; the binding warp is white silk. Approximately 4 ground and 1 binding warp thread. The ground weft is black silk. The patterned weft is made up of paired shoots of silver fris\u00e9. The brocaded wefts are silver fris\u00e9, coloured silks (tan, maroon, pink, two yellows, two greens, two blues and white). The black ground weft outlines some details of the design.  \n\nThe selvedges reveal evidence of use, the panel having been unpicked from its original composition. They are half an inch in two sections of fine and coarse tabby.",
