The design for the ring was conceived in 2000, and the first ring was made in 2002.  The title 'Raindance' celebrates the abundance and good fortune which traditionally follow a raindance. \n\nBy August 2009 over a thousand 'Raindance' rings had been sold in a number of different versions: in gold and diamonds; platinum and diamonds; pink sapphires, diamonds and platinum; and aquamarines, diamonds and platinum.\n\nBoodles was founded as Boodle and Dunthorne in Liverpool in 1798.  Its London shops include one in New Bond Street opened in 2007.  It also has shops in Liverpool, Manchester, Chester and Dublin.  Boodles is a family company run by Nicholas and Michael Wainwright, the fifth generation to work in the business.",
