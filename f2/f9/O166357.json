Brock for the D'Oyly Carte Company, to advertise their newly-designed production of Iolantheon tour during the 1920s. It depicts Private Willis of the First Grenadier Guards sprouting wings to become a fairy at the end of Act II in order to marry the Fairy Queen and save her life. It would have been overpasted with details of the theatre at which the company was appearing, and commissioned by Rupert D'Oyly Carte who had several Gilbert and Sullivan operas redesigned for the London season at the Princes Theatre from September 1919 to January 1920.\n\nThe artist Henry Matthew Brock (1875-1960) was a prolific book and magazine illustrator who illustrated children's books and contributed artwork to magazines including Punch, The Graphic and The Sphere. He liked the theatre and especially the operas produced by the D'Oyly Carte Company. He designed several posters for them as well as the programme cover illustration for their 1919-1920 season at the Princes Theatre, and a set of watercolour drawings of Gilbert and Sullivan characters for cigarette cards issued by John Player & Sons in 1925 and 1926.",
