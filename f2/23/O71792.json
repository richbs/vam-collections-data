Turner modelled works to be cast in bronze as well as carving many different types of stone. Here, the smooth surfaces of the figures make a deliberate contrast with the rough block on which they sit.\n\nAlfred Turner trained at the South London Technical Art School under W. S. Frith (1850-1924) and worked for a time as assistant to Harry Bates (1850-1899). In 1895 he entered the Royal Academy Schools. Spielmann described Turner as a 'highly successful student of the Lambeth and Royal Academy schools, who has also studied abroad ... [and is] among the most promising of the youngest generation of sculptors now before the public'. This work is based on a smaller group exhibited by Turner at the Royal Academy in 1934 (Mus. no. 1591).\n\nTurner, who taught at the Central School of Arts and Crafts, London, was a frequent exhibitor at the Royal Academy between 1905 and 1937. He was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1922, and became a Royal Academician in 1931. His diploma work, Dreams of Youth, is in the Royal Academy's permanent collection. His daughter Winifred was a successful sculptor in her own right. Her bronze figure of a Crouching Youth is also in the Museum's collections (Mus. no. A.12-1981). The Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, held a joint exhibition of work by father and daughter in 1988.",
