It was acquired from a Swiss collector, Bernard Vuilleumier, and it was part of the biggest group of Chinese dress ever purchased by the Museum up to that time.  The detail here is from the decorated yoke of the jacket.  This goes around each shoulder, with white satin edgings outlining its foliated margins.  Shaped black velvet and a band of orange velvet, painted with black stripes to resemble a tiger, adds richness and lustre to the garment.  The Museum records describe it as an imperial hunting tunic for a theatrical performance.  Throughout most of the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) successive emperors made long excursions to their northern hunting parks to kill game, including tigers.  During these hutns, foreign nobility, who did not live in Beijing, would renew their allegiance to the throne.  Such presentations rituals might require clothes like the one here.",
