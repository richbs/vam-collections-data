This object is one of a group of 182 pieces of porcelain acquired by the V&A from this wreck. This object as it exists now as a so-called 'sea-sculpture' was created through accident and nature. These objects were fused together by a fire on board the ship, which was possibly the cause of the wreck. The coral grew on these fused pieces whilst they lay on the seabed.  The component pieces of porcelain were mass produced in Jingdezhen, Southern China.",
