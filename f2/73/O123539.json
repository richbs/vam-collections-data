They were particularly suitable for large, formal houses, where visitors and servants might wait in the hall. Their essential feature was a wooden seat, which could be cleaned easily. Mahogany was widely used for all furniture from the 1720s; it was suitable for hall furniture, being hard-wearing and capable of taking a glossy polish.  \n\nHall chairs sometimes had panels on the chair-back, on which the owner's coat of arms, crest or cypher (family badge) could be painted. The plain circular panel in this chair-back may have been intended for a coat of arms, but does not appear to have been used. This hall chair has solid trestle legs front and back, a form often used in the 18th century for hall chairs. The style originated in Italy, so they are sometimes called 'sgabello' chairs, from the Italian term for a stool.",
