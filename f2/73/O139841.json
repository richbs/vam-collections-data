They kept it in order by twisting or braiding it, often mixed with coloured ribbons, and held it in place with hair pins.  These came in many shapes and sizes, depending on the local fashion.  Hair pins worn with traditional dress were usually large and decorative.  They were made of silver, sometimes set with coloured stones, and often matched their owner's other jewellery.\n\nFiligree is one of the commonest elements of traditional jewellery from the south German region.  It was made in many centres, and also imported from Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd.  Many of the pieces were put together by home workers, including women and children.  This kept costs down, and allowed the manufacturers to sell their goods at a low price. The swirling shape of the petals round the central garnet on this pin is typical of filigree from the region, as are the flat-cut garnets themselves.  They are found on buttons and choker clasps as well as hair pins.",
