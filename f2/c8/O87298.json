Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nMusic for the Millions, produced by the impresario Harold Fielding, was a popular production in the 1950s for seaside holiday venues.  After its appearance at Oxford in August 1955 it was produced at the Winter Gardens Theatre, Bournemouth, in 1956 and at the Pavilion, Torquay, in 1957.",
