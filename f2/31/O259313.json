            "public_access_description": "This scene is typical of the pastoral and theatrical or literary scenes printed on cotton textiles in the late 18th century in various centres of cotton printing across northern Europe, including that of Wesserling in Alsace where this piece was made. The imagery was based on works by the Dutch artist Karel Dujardin (about 1622-78). The most famous cotton-printing factory was propitiously located at Jouy-en-Josas, half way between Paris and Versailles, the main residences of the French court - and the most desired and likely market for these expensive furnishings textiles.\n\nThe picnic depicted here is staged - a theatrical moment in an outdoor setting. All figures are dressed in clothes that refer back to 17th-century historical styles - the large brimmed hats with their large feathers are similar to those worn in Rubens's paintings, while the paned sleeves on the woman's dress and the paned breeches of the boys lounging on the ground date to the first half of the 17th rather than to the 18th century. The short jackets are reminiscent of 17th-century doublets. Some of these elements of dress became popular again in late 18th-century fashionable dress, having been worn both on the stage for historical plays and also at masquerades where aristocrats chose to dress up as figures from a previous age.",
