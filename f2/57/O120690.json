            "public_access_description": "This salver belongs to a class of Indian metalwork known as bidri and was made in the 18th century in the Deccan region of south India. The technique takes its name from the city of Bidar, in present day Karnataka, where it is thought to have originated. \"Bidri\" describes objects made from a high-zinc alloy and inlaid with silver or brass, or a combination of both, as here, or overlaid with patterns of silver or brass wire hammered on to a cross-hatched ground. When the surface ornamentation has been completed, the craftsman briefly covers the object with a mud paste contining salt, ammonium chloride and unrefined potassium nitrate. When the paste is removed, the natural dull grey of the zinc alloy has changed colour to a deep, matt black which enhances, without altering, the brightness of the inlay. The earliest pieces of bidri date from the early 17th century, when production is thought to have been only in centres such as Bidar and Hyderadabad in the Deccan sultanates. These independent Muslim kingdoms in the south of India were conquered by the Mughal emperor Alamgir (r. 1658-1707) in the second half of the 17th century. Their independent artistic styles then became heavily influenced by Mughal art, and techniques such as bidri spread beyond the Deccan.\nThis piece was bought in 1883 by the South Kensington Museum, and was wrongly identified as \"Persian\".",
