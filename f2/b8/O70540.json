It shows St. Erasmus, wearing mitre and short drawers, lying left to right on a trestle-table, his hands behind his back. There is a hole in his belly. His feet are bound by a rope. The rope is being pulled with both hands by a torturer who is lying underneath the table, bracing his feet against a stone. He is wearing a belted doublet. At the top right-hand corner of the frament are the legs of another torturer, who is kneeling on his right knee. He is turning a windlass of which only the base remains. The panel depicts the martyrdom of St. Erasmus.\n\nThe trestle legs are broken and the bottom right-hand corner of the panel is missing. The surface of the panel is weathered. Some green, yellow and brown paint remains on the carving, but is probably modern. There are traces of gilding on the saint's drawers, mitre and hair which look original. The back of the panel is covered with a random criss-cross of lines. There is one lead-plugged hole.",

It shows St Erasmus, wearing a mitre and short drawers, lying left to right on a trestle-table, his hands are behind his back and there is a hole in his belly. His feet are found by a rope and a torturer, who is lying underneath the table is shown bracing his feet against a stone. \n\nThe panel shows the martyrdom of St Erasmus. According to legend, a windlass was used to unwind the entrails of the saint.",
