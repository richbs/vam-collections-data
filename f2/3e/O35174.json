It was just one of a multitude of souvenirs made to commemorate the wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer. Many such mugs, particularly the more expensive ones, would have been set aside as keepsakes. Others, being perfectly functional, would have been used. This one was used regularly by Museum staff, prior to its selection for display in the British Galleries and its formal acquisition for the V&A collection. \n\n People\nThe marriage of Prince Charles, heir to the British throne, took place in St Paul's Cathedral, London, on  29 July 1981. The day was one of national celebration and the wedding was seen by some as the fairytale conclusion to the romantic courtship of the Prince and his 20-year-old bride. However, in 1992 the couple agreed to separate, and the marriage was finally dissolved four years later. The Princess was killed in a car crash in Paris in 1997.",
