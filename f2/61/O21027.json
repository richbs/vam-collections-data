During the 18th century tea was made in front of family and guests in well-off households, rather than in the kitchen. Like other tea utensils, canisters are therefore often highly decorative. Initially an expensive luxury confined to the wealthy, tea became more widely drunk as prices fell during the 18th century. The gradual fall in price was reflected in the increasing size of these containers over the course of the century.\n\nTechniques\nItems of tin-glazed earthenware, such as this tea canister, were fired for the first time before their glaze and decoration were applied. The wares emerged from this 'biscuit' firing in a hard and slightly porous state. The pots were then dipped in glaze and set on boards to dry. The raw glaze was delicate and liable to come off, and once dry had a powdery and highly absorbent surface. Painting of considerable refinement could be carried out on this surface, as is demonstrated by the ships that appear on this caddie. However, the absorbent nature of the unfired glaze meant that mistakes could not be erased. Once the decoration was complete the wares were fired for a second time.",
