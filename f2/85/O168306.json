Sophocles's tragedy is one of the world's earliest surviving plays, tracing the tragedy of Oedipus, who blinds himself when he discovers that he has unknowingly married his own mother. Olivier's cry of tormented anguish has gone down as one of the greatest moments of 20th century theatre. \n \nThe costume, designed by  Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Dast\u00e9, is strikingly austere, in keeping with the overall atmosphere of the play. It was made at a time of great deprivation in Britain, when fabrics were strictly rationed, but this has been turned to advantage. The only decorations on the basic deep blue wool tunic are moulded, gold-painted leather motifs, which give weight and authority; while the sense is of some archaic period, the overall feeling is of timelessness, in keeping with the universal themes of Sophocles's play.",
