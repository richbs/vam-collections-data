His work may be described as Symbolist and has much in common with that of figures such as Odilon Redon and Gustave Dor\u00e9, although Hieronymus Bosch, Giovanni Battista Piranesi and Francisco de Goya have also been cited as possible influences. \n\nBrandel\u2019s imagery often includes fantastical architecture or disturbing landscapes peopled by strange flying or floating beings. He also produced other material, such as portraits and ex-libris plates for book collectors, designed to suggest their taste, personality or achievements. \n\nThis ex-libris was made for an international grain trader. It shows the collector\u2019s portrait in a lozenge with, on one side, an ocean-going liner and, on the other, a house with the sun rising beside it. The lozenge itself is supported on a sheaf of grain and surmounted by a crowned phoenix and a tree.",
