It is a coloured copy of a plain white plaster tablet designed by Edward Burne-Jones (1833-1898) in memory of his close friend Laura Lyttleton (n\u00e9e Tennant), who died in childbirth in 1886 within the first year of her marriage. The original was installed in the church of St Andrew in Mells, Somerset. The coloured version was made for Burne-Jones's own house, The Grange, Fulham.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nBurne-Jones had been studying Byzantine art. The peacock was a symbol of the Resurrection in Greek culture of the Christian era.\n\nPeople\nLady Georgiana Burne-Jones described this tablet in her biography of her husband thus: - 'Laura, the daughter of Sir Charles Tennant: in our house she so fascinated us all that we called her The Siren\"\".   [Her memorial] is eight feet high\"  and an effigy of a peacock which is the symbol of the Resurrection standing upon a laurel tree - and the laurel grows out of the tomb and burst through the side of the tomb with a determination to go on living and refusing to be dead and below was a Latin inscription made by Dean Church one of the many who loved her.'",
