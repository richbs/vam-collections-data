This panel shows an intermediate stage in the creation of leather panels, with only the background coloured in brown paint and some of the relief areas foiled and varnished to give the appearance of gilding, with some areas left unvarnished and appearing as silver.  The panel is now in four pieces.\n[Leather panel] One of the shorter edges is irregular and has clearly worn through and detached from 3704B-1856 as a result of having been folded under for display.\n[Leather panel] One long edge is roughened.  It was originally joined to 3704C-1856 and cracked along a fold that was presumably made for display purposes.\n[Leather panel] This panel is composed of two skins, the join visible on the back, approximately 16.5 cm from the lower edge. One of the longer edges is irregular and has clearly worn through and detached from 3704-1856 as a result of having been folded under for display.

This panel shows an intermediate stage, after the damp leather has been pressed into a mould to create the relief decoration, the background painted brown and parts of the relief decoration have been covered in silver-coloured metal foil, varnished to give the appearance of gold leaf. Such leather panels are often called 'gilt leather', although no actual gilding is involved. \n\nThe panels were made in about 1855 by the French firm of Jacques Michel Dulud, who exhibited them at the Paris International Exhibition in that year, but they may have been designed as much as fifteen years earlier. The firm often designed in historic styles, which were particularly fashionable at the time.  The panels were intended to be used for wall hangings or for upholstery.",
