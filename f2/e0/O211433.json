            "public_access_description": "Jamie Reid's (b. 1947) cut-and-paste aesthetic grew from his interest in radical politics. His artistic style developed while at art college in Croydon, where he was influenced by the ideas of the avant-garde political group, the Situationist International. The political slant to his art was aroused by the May 1968 Paris student riots, which inspired fraternal protests organised by Reid at the Croydon College of Art. These were directed with fellow student Malcolm McLaren (1946-2010), later to become the manager of the Sex Pistols.\n\nThis t-shirt documents the period after the Sex Pistols essentially broke up, with singer John Lydon leaving and Sid Vicious (1957-1979) releasing solo singles under the Pistols name. His recording of Eddie Cochran's 1959 rockabilly hit, Something Else, was released shortly after his death in June 1979. As this t-shirt promotes, it was featured on the soundtrack to the Sex Pistols documentary, The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle.",
