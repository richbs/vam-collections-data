This chalice would have been originally accompanied by a paten (dish) for the consecrated bread. According to Catholic belief the wine and bread are miraculously transformed into the blood and body of Christ during the Mass. The bowls of silver chalices are usually gilded inside, to emphasize the precious nature of their contents and to protect the metal.\n\nOn this chalice, the elaborate tracery, acanthus leaves, thistles and intricate foliage mirror the exuberant stonework of medieval churches.  The arms on the foot are of Gonzalo Davila, Steward to the Catholic Kings and Master of Calatrava and of his second wife, Maria de Saavedra.",
