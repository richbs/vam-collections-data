The severe, abstract shape of this piece is related to the monumental forms of the Empire style which dominated design throughout Europe in the first 20 years of the 19th century. However, the oval shape is one of the more fanciful shapes, such as lyres and globes, which were favoured for secretaires in Vienna in the succeeding decade and which became a mark of the emerging Biedermeier style. The carefully matched veneers, the sparse, gilded mounts and the penwork that decorates the interior of the secretaire, were all typical of  Biedermeier design. The dated drawer also carries the signature of the cabinet-maker Franz Steindl. He worked in Budapest from the 1820s, but the shape of the secretaire suggests that Steindl may have learnt his skills in Vienna at least seven years earlier.",
