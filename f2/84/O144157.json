They succeeded in forming plywood in three planes to create softly curving, organic shapes. The LCW chair (standing for Lounge Chair Wood) was one of several variant designs from the years immediately after the War that all featured separate seats and backs.  The first Eames plywood chairs were made in Los Angeles by Evans Products, but from 1946 the bigger Herman Miller Furniture Company in Zeeland, Michigan, marketed the furniture, and from 1949 Herman Miller took over production too.  The furniture was aimed at middle-class American families that wanted an up-to-date image. This example was part of the furnishings of the Tarter House in Los Angeles, designed by the architect Gregory Ain.",
