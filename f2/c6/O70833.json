It shows God the Father with a hoe and a scroll with the inscription: \"pater umificat\" [The Father revives],  and the Virgin pouring liquid from a jug onto the ground beneath the cross with the inscription: \"maria fecundat\" [Mary fertilises].  On top of the cross is a scroll with the inscriptions (almost illegible):\"ego uitis vera\" [Ego sum vitis vera- I am the true vine. John XV,1], and  \"ego sum uitis vos palmites\" [I am the vine, you are its branches. John XV,5]. Above the scrolls appears the Dove of the Holy Spirit.\nThe roundel is cast in one piece. Several cracks and repairs are visible  on the edge. Two cracks run diagonally across the relief, visible from the back. A leaf at the top left is re-modelled and a hole at the top has a later filling. On the back is written in black ink: \"No. 2569\" and the letters \"P L\" in an early nineteenth-century hand. There are two fingerprints on the reverse.The background of the frame is painted dark blue. The  vine-leaves framing the scene are unpainted.  In the centre brown branches with green grapes frame the images of the Apostles in alternating red and grey robes. The extremities of the brown cross are red;  the rocky ground is also painted dark blue. The Virgin wears a grey gown with a red belt and a white mantle, and holds a red jug. God the Father wears a red mantle. The haloes of God the Father, Christ, the Virgin and the Apostles are yellow.",

The inner circle shows Jesus Christ crucified on a vine, tended by God the Father and the Virgin Mary, with the images of the twelve Apostles (Christ's first followers). This image conveys the idea of mankind's redemption through Christ. It is also, simultaneously, a symbolic representation of the Christian church, according to St John's Gospel in the Bible. \n\nThe prototype of this and other terracotta (baked clay) reliefs was probably a metal or limestone example. The reliefs, which are probably from the Rhineland in Germany, have been dated to about 1430 to 1440. This is the only one that has been enhanced by the addition of colours (polychromed).",

These have been dated about 1430-40, and a Middle Rhenish origin has been suggested by Arens. The present relief is the only version which has been polychromed, and must have been used for devotional purposes. Roundels in terracotta of a similar size were also produced in the workshop of Judocus Vredis (about 1470-1540) in the Cistercian abbey in Wedderen near D\u00fclmen in Westfalia.  These reliefs are stylistically reminiscent of the production in terracotta in Utrecht. The subject of Christ crucified on the vine tended by God the Father and the Virgin with the images of twelve Apostles conveys the idea of mankind's redemption through Christ,  whilst being simultaneously a representation of the Church according to John XV, 1.",
