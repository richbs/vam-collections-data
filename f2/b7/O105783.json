She especially loved the ability of puppetry to combine painting, sculpture, music and drama, and made these near the start of her career as a carver and puppeteer. They were exhibited in the Royal Scottish Academy in 1976 and performed at the Netherbow Theatre and the Queen's Hall in Edinburgh. Great attention to detail in the carving and in the dressing of the marionettes, especially the horses, has made them marvellously lifelike.\n\nMrs Shillabeer created various full-scale marionette shows, some of which appeared during the Edinburgh Festival, including Peter and the Wolf, Boite a Jou-Jou (The Toy Box), and Babar the Elephant. Other puppets by Mary Shillabeer are in the Museum of Childhood in Edinburgh and at the Little Theatre in Biggar, near Edinburgh.",
