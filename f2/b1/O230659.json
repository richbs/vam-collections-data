Reynolds, <i>Victoria and Albert Museum: Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, 1973, pp. 36-37\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n'The inscriptions on the back of the drawing were presumably written by Lionel Bicknell Constable, the artist's youngest son. According to information communicated by Mr. D. Charman, Archivist to the East Suffolk County Council, L. B. Constable owned two properties in East Bergholt Street, which  he had inherited from John Constable: a house and garden, and a cottage and garden. These were purchased by John Constable from Robert Grimes in 1802. Lionel Bicknell Constable was admitted to his father's property in 1837, according to the custom of the manor, since John Constable had died intestate. The present-day East Bergholt Post Office occupies the space between the two cottages in the centre of this view, and the gable end of the taller buildings on the left is virtually unchanged. Stylistically the drawing belongs to the time when Constable after a drawing by Smith (reproduced by Key, p. 15). Holmes, p. 238, dates 1797.'\n\nG Reynolds",

His fondness for painting, without any marked precocity, had already declared itself by the time he was 16 or 17: and he was encouraged in this taste by his friendship with John Dunthorne, a plumber and glazier of East Bergholt, who was an amateur painter.
