It would have been used for creating his wife Gertrude Orchard's illustrated headed notepaper. \n\nGertrude Hannah Orchard (1883-1947), known as Gertie, was born in Blackpool and was working as a professional singer by 1911 when she met Will Judge, probably in Leiston, Suffolk. They married in June 1912 when they were  both twenty-eight and went on to work as a double act in the 1910s and 1920s, entertaining in Derby, Kent, Sussex, Plymouth and Portsmouth. Gertrude Orchard also played Principal Boy, appearing with Will Judge in the Fulham Theatre 1912/13 production of The House That Jack Built and the Cheltenham Opera House Aladdin, 1915/16.",
