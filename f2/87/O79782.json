The Egyptian veil worn by lower class Moslem women at that time consisted of a long rectangle of black cloth, made of an openwork panel of crocheted cotton or pierced crepe, about 15-20 cm wide.  It had strings attached at either side of the top edge which were tied at the back of the head.  A third string, which ran over the top of the head, was attached to the centre of the top edge to prevent the veil from slipping down.  This tube was strung on the centre thread where it joined the veil, over the bridge of the nose.   \n\nThis tube is a late example made from sheet metal stamped to imitate wrapped wire, which was the traditional way they were made.  After independence in 1922, Egyptian women stopped wearing the face veil, and with that these tubes also became obsolete.",

Its purpose is to hold up the strings that are tied at the back of the head to keep in place the burqu', or veil; the latter is made of crinkly black silk or a lacy type of cloth, manufactured in al-Mahalla al-Kubra, the textile center of Egypt. The metal from which it is fashioned depends on the wealth of the user. It could be made of silver, gold, gold-plated metal or even brass ... It is called a 'arusa ('doll') because of the shimmer of the gold or brass against the black of the veil.\np180 - The use of the burqu' was widespread among women of the Sha'bi classes until the early twentieth century. The women of the middle and upper classes had the veil (the Turkish-style yashmak), but when the women's liberation movement, headed by Huda Shaarawi, encouraged women to do away with the veil, women of the Sha'bi classes also gave up their burqu' and the 'doll' gradually disappeared.\n<i>Enchanted Jewelry of Egypt: The Traditional Art and Craft</i>, Azza Fahmy, 2007",
