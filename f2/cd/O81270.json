By not having to take on so much commercial work, he was able to concentrate on more sculptural pieces, most with forms derived from nature and using the reflectiveness of silver as the only form of decoration.  He was able to achieve the simple and clean lines necessary by using TIG silver welding, a technique pioneered by Hector Miller that enables formed or cast components to be seamlessly joined, liberating the designer from the need to create feature lines or wires to hide solder seams.",
