He studied History of the Arts at the University of Florence under the pre-eminent art critic Roberto Longhi.  In the 1950s he turned to photography and was commissioned by the major Italian magazines of the time such as L'Illustrazione Italiana, Settimo giorno and Annabella.  These first photographs were reportage images of social life in Milan and portraits of leading personalities of culture and cinema.\n \nIn the late 1950s, Castaldi met Anna Piaggi and started working with her on fashion stories. They married in New York in 1962 and they worked together until his death in 1995.  Alfa and Anna were part of the artistic and literarily intelligentsia of Milan, and gathered with friends and fellow photographers in 'Bar Giamaica' in the Brera neighbourhood of the city.  Castaldi\u2019s interest in photojournalism took him abroad, including to Paris, to cover the French colonization of Algeria, and to London, to capture the anti-nuclear demonstrations. \n\nBy 1969, he was one of the major contributors to Vogue Italia.  At the end of the 1960s he opened a studio in Milan and began to work on advertising campaigns for leading designers such as Giorgio Armani, Laura Biagiotti, Fendi, Gianfranco Ferr\u00e9, Karl Lagerfield and Ottavio and Rosita Missoni.  He also collaborated with L'Uomo Vogue, Vanity, Amica, Panorama and L'Espresso.",
