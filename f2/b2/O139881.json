It commemorates the launch of the space shuttle Shenzhou 6,  China's second manned space flight, launched on 12 October 2005, the 2nd anniversary of the launch of its predecessor, Shenzhou 5. \n\nThe space mission was carried out by astronauts Fei Junlong and Nie Haisheng, and among the objects that travelled with them on the spacecraft were a silk newspaper and limited copies of a commemorative First Day Cover, which the Jiefang Daily press group produced. This printed silk is a facsimile of the original that travelled into space. \n\nFor many centuries in China the educated classes used silk for writing. This newspaper revives the use of silk to communicate ideas, but with modern printing methods. It also symbolically links one of the oldest forms of technology (silk production)\nwith one of the most modern (space travel).The front page of this memorial edition features a reprint of the article \u2018On Earth\u2019, one of the earliest journalistic essays published in 1872 by Shenbao, a pioneering newspaper based in Shanghai.\n\nAnother event featured on the silk newspaper looks forward to Shanghai Expo 2010, the first international exposition to be held in China.",
