The firm was founded in the 1890s when the family fled Poland and set up a jewellery manufacturing company in the East End. The first Kutchinsky shop was on the Commercial Road and became known for its fine platinum jewellery. By the 1950s, the firm had moved to Knightsbridge where it continues in business under new management.",
