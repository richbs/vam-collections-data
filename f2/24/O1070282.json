Full Citation:\n\n\u201c<b>115 Sir John Dormer, Bart</b>\n(b.c.1640 d.167 5) \n<b>1674</b> \nP27-1941 \n\n<b>Oval 38 x 33 mm (roughly trimmed)</b> \n\nFeatures broadly brushed, the strokes tending horizontally, in brown and sanguine, with gum and opaque grey touches, blended with gouache over a pale creamy carnation ground; the hair washed in brown over a paler brown wash, and the lights in gouache; costume washed and worked over in layers of brown and grey gouache; the background in pale brown washes, hatched over with dark brown to the left of the sitter's head; a marginal gold strip; on vellum put down on pasteboard (cut from a playing card). \n\n<b>Condition:</b> Some flaking in the white of the costume; otherwise fine. \n\n<b>Signed:</b> In red with the brush on the back: <i>M.S / fc / 1674</i>. \n\n<b>Frame:</b> Seventeenth-century gold locket, the back of flat glass held in a rebate; the sides straight with a central fillet of square section down the middle, the upper part of the sides flaring out slightly to the bezel, which holds a slightly convex glass by its bevelled edge; no visible marks of a hanger or other devices for suspension. The glazed compartment at the back contains a lock of hair; engraved on the outer flange of the rebate: <i>Iohn Dormer 1674 In Heaven is my Hope and Rest</i>. \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> Samuel S Joseph: given to the Museum by his widow, Mrs Emma Joseph, May 1941. \n\n<b>Literature:</b> <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 57; Murdoch 1981, pl. 25d. \n\nWhen in the Joseph Collection, this miniature was correctly attributed to Snelling and appears accordingly on the schedules of Mrs Joseph's gift of 1941. Carl Winter, however, since there was no record of the signature, assumed that the attribution was mere guesswork, and the miniature was thus catalogued from the start in the Museum as 'Unknown English 17th Century' .As such, it was overlooked in the postwar literature and not included in exhibitions. The signature was rediscovered during work on this catalogue. \n\nSir John Dormer was the eldest son of John Dormer (1611-1619), a barrister, of Lee Grange, Quainton, Buckinghamshire, and of Purston in Northamptonshire. He matriculated at Oxford (Christ Church) on 23 July 1656 and graduated MA in 1663; was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 26 May 1658; and, on the evidence of the inscription on the miniature, served as a soldier, being first knighted then almost immediately raised to the baronetage on 23 July 1661. He was married at the age of twenty-two in August 1662. He died at Livorno on 7 November 1675 (buried at Quainton on 23 February 1675/6) and was succeeded by his second but only surviving son William, who was born in 1668 or 1669 and died insane and unmarried on 9 March 1725/6, when the baronetcy became extinct.
