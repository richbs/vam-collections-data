He settled in Ecouen where an art colony had been started by Pierre Edouard Fr\u00e8re (1819-1886), a former pupil of Paul Delaroche (1797-1856). He started exhibiting at the Salon in 1846.\n\nThis painting is a fine example of Duverger's genre scenes, a category for which he is now best known. His art ranges from charming scenes of domestic life to works concentrating on the idleness of a more bourgeois world. This is the case here with the depiction of a luxury domestic interior with a elegantly dressed woman examining a large piece of fabric presented by a dressmaker. This peaceful scene is characteristic of the works that Duverger produced from the 1860s onwards.",

            "history_note": "Bequeathed by Joshua Dixon, 1886\n\nHistorical significance: This painting is a typical example of the kind of charming and unchallenging imagery that developed under the Second republic and Second Empire in France. \nIt shows a humble woman dressed in black presenting a large piece of fabric to an elegant woman seated in an armchair in a bourgeois interior. Duverger specialised in this kind of pictures for which he is now best known. \nThese scenes of domestic life proved quite popular to the bourgeois audience at the time, eager to forget the aftermaths of the Revolution of 1848. These compositions result from the combination of a new interest of domestic subject appeared in the Realist movement, which emerged in the 1840s, and the revival of genre scenes, influenced by the 17th-century Dutch imagery. \nComparable works include <i>The Music Lesson</i>, National Academy of Design, New York, and <i>Best Friends</i>, Private collection.",

            "historical_context_note": "'Genre painting' describes scenes of everyday life set in domestic interiors or in the countryside, especially those produced by 17th-century Dutch painters such as Gerard ter Borch, Jan Steen, and Pieter de Hooch. These subjects were not particularly popular with Italian and French artists before the 18th century. Even then, Italian genre painting is mainly restricted to works produced by Northern artists active in Bologna and the Veneto such as Giuseppe Maria Crespi (1665-1747), Giovanni Battista Piazzetta (1682-1754), Pietro Longhi (ca. 1701-1785) and Giacomo Ceruti (1698-1767). In this pre-Enlightment society, issues of social class, the legitimacy of power and the needs of common people were beginning to be discussed in Holland, England and France and the debates were slowly filtering down to Italy. Bolognese intellectual life was particularly active and Crespi, who was corresponding one of the most notable academics, Antonio Muratori (1672-1750), appears to have created a visual response to these debates. The works of the <i>Bamboccianti,</i> mostly Netherlandish painters specialising in low-life paintings, painted in Rome in the mid 17th century, may also have provided a source for Italian genre painters while the <i>commedia dell'arte</i> profoundly inspired Crespi and the development of this new Italian version of genre painting. From Bologna the genre spread to Venice thanks to Venetians artists such as Piazzetta and Longhi. They drew the attention of foreign collectors, most notably Joseph Smith the British Consul in Venice, who amassed an impressive collection of such artworks and of Venetian art in general and contributed to the growing taste for these in England. In France, the genre was mainly introduced in the second quarter of the 17th century by the Le Nain brothers, especially Antoine and Louis, whose works still pose problems of individual identification. Genre paintings would be reactivated during the 19th century when artists such as Gustave Courbet (1819-1877) whose art was based on the impartial observation of contemporary life.",
