London, 1973, pp. 257-259, cat. no. 320.\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\nPiat Joseph SAUVAGE (1744-1818) \nFrench School \n\nBorn in Tournai, he studied painting in Tournai and Antwerp and became painter to the Netherlandish court in 1774. In the same year he moved to Paris, where he became a member of the Acad\u00e9mie Royale (1783) and court painter to the Prince du Cond\u00e9 and to Louis XVI.  During this period he returned frequently to Flanders, where he was engaged in buying pictures for the Comte D' Angiviller in 1785-86. He joined the side of the Revolutionaries in c. 1789, was allowed a studio in the Louvre and in 1795, commanded a battalion of the Parisian National Guard. Nevertheless, in 1814 he assured the Prince du Cond\u00e9 that he had been a royalist all the time. In 1808 he returned to Tournai, where he became a teacher at the Academy. \nHe painted mainly decorative grisailles in imitation of classical sculpture, and also miniatures imitating cameos. His decorations still exist at the Chateaux of Compi\u00e8gne (1785), Rambouillet (1786-87) and Fontainebleau (1786). Several of his portraits, including that of William Beckford, were engraved. \nThe Museum also has a drawing of a Sacrifice by Sauvage (D.376-1887) and a miniature in the style of Sauvage (Dept. of Metalwork, 216-1878). \n\n320 \nTHE SALE OF CUPIDS \nOil on marble, in imitation of bas relief \n10 \u00bd  X 17 \u00be  (26.7 X 45) \n9120-1863 \n\nOriginally unattributed, the authorship became apparent in 1935, when various documents and fragments of paper were found at the back of the marble, which had broken into five pieces. One of these papers, a letter of invitation from one 'Cajarelle ain\u00e9' of the Minist\u00e8re de la Police G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la R\u00e9publique is dated '11 Fructidor an 6 de la R\u00e9publique' (i.e. August 1799), which provides an approximate date for the painting. \nThe composition is closely derived from a classical fresco from Stabiae, now in the National Museum at Naples, which was discovered in 1759. An engraving of this fresco appeared in <i>Le pitture antiche d' Ercolano</i> (part of <i>Le antichit\u00e0 di Ercolano esposte</i>), iii, 1762, pl. 7, and from that date it was not only reproduced in every illustrated book on Herculaneum but also used as a model by innumerable artists who sought inspiration in the recently excavated paintings of ancient Rome. Sauvage himself exhibited an earlier version at the Acad\u00e9mie de S. Luc in 1774 (<i>Livrets des expo de l'acad. de S.Luc</i>, 1872, p. 156). Free versions exist by J. M. Vien (Fontainebleau Museum, 1763), Salomon Gessner (etching 1770, Leeman-van Elck no. 27(5)) and Henry Fuseli (drawing, c. 1775, New York, Collection Robert Halsband), The great popularity of the <i>Mercantessa di Amorini</i> provides an indication of the important part played by the excavations at Herculaneum and Pompeii in the rise of neo-classicism in the second half of the 18th century. The theme was revived by the French neo-Grecians (Hamon, G\u00e9rome, etc.) in the mid-19th century, and in c. 1875 Wilhelm von Kaulbach produced an erotic satire on the theme; nor was he, it appears, the first to do so. \nThe great publication of 1762 contained a long and learned interpretation of the composition.  It was described as representing Indigence selling three cupids to Venus, behind whom stands Persuasion -this last figure was omitted by Sauvage in his otherwise close copy of the original. But these identifications were subsequently abandoned (e.g. St Non, <i>Voyage pittoresque</i>, p ii, 1782, pl. 30) in favour of a more general allegorical interpretation. \n\nCondition. Cracks visible where the marble has been repaired on more than one occasion, the last time being 1935.\nProv. Bought by the Museum in 1863.\nLit. On the subject of the composition, see W.

One of these papers, a letter from one 'Cajarelle ain\u00e9' of the Minist\u00e8re de la Police G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la R\u00e9publique to the \"Citoyen Sauvage\" is dated '11 Fructidor an 6 de la R\u00e9publique' (i.e. August 1799), providing an approximate date for the painting. \n\nIt represents two women in profile seated face to face on stools, one selling cupids kept in a cage to the other. This composition appears to be derived from a fresco painting discovered in Stabia in 1759 and now in the Museo Nazionale Archeologico, Naples. The subject may embody an enigmatic allegorical meaning.\n \nThis work, which imitates classical low relief in its design and technique, demonstrates the influence of classical designs discovered in Herculaneum and Pompei on the art of the second half of the 18th century.A replica of this composition by Sauvage is in the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de La Rochelle, however the small putto behind the seller is missing and the technique is in oil paint on copper. Another version, a grisaille painting (whereabouts unknown), was exhibited at the Academy of Saint Luke in 1774.\n\nThis subject was imitated by other painters such as Joseph-Marie Vien who painted a <i>Marchande d'Amours</i> in 1763, Mus\u00e9e du Ch\u00e2teau, Fontainebleau, Salomon Gessner, (engraving, 1770) and Henry Fuseli (drawing, ca. 1775, Collection Robert Halsband, New York). \n\nThe great popularity of the <i>Mercantessa di Amorini</i> provides an indication of the important part played by the excavations at Herculaneum and Pompeii in the rise of neo-classicism in the second half of the 18th century. The theme was revived by the French neo-Grecians (Hamon, G\u00e9rome, etc.) in the mid-19th century, and in c. 1875 Wilhelm von Kaulbach produced an erotic satire on the theme; nor was he, it appears, the first to do so.",

            "historical_context_note": "Neo-classicism developed in the second half of the 18th century, stimulated by the archaeological rediscovery of ancient Roman and Greek civilisation and domestic life, especially at Herculaneum from 1738 and Pompeii from 1748. This revived interest for the Antique lifestyle was witnessed in the fine arts by the choice of subject matters inspired by Antique heroes such as those of Jacques-Louis David, which exalted republican heroism.\nThis taste also gave birth to furnished interiors combining Greek and Roman decorative and architectural sources. Neo-classical design was publicised through the <i>Works in Architecture of Robert and James Adam</i> (London, 1773-9) and became the official state-sponsored mode in Napoleonic France.\n\nBorn in Tournai, Sauvage studied painting in Tournai and Antwerp and became painter to the Netherlandish court in 1774. In the same year he moved to Paris, where he became a member of the Acad\u00e9mie Royale (1783) and court painter to the Prince du Cond\u00e9 and to Louis XVI.  During this period he returned frequently to Flanders, where he was engaged in buying pictures for the Comte D' Angiviller in 1785-86. He joined the side of the Revolutionaries in c. 1789, was allowed a studio in the Louvre and in 1795, commanded a battalion of the Parisian National Guard. Nevertheless, in 1814 he assured the Prince du Cond\u00e9 that he had been a royalist all the time. In 1808 he returned to Tournai, where he became a teacher at the Academy. He painted mainly decorative grisailles in imitation of classical sculpture, and also miniatures imitating cameos. His decorations still exist at the Chateaux of Compi\u00e8gne (1785), Rambouillet (1786-87) and Fontainebleau (1786). Several of his portraits, including that of William Beckford, were engraved.",
