That is, flatly and without the robust movement typical in Europe. More like the stone walls of Peru\u201d\n\nIt was especially scaled to be suitable for upholstery and designed to give an impression of great age, patina and antiquity. For some of the colourways the cloth was double-dyed to create a deep, iridescent patinated effect. The available colourways were \"Wild Honey\", \"Tortoise\", \"Crimson\" and \"Bronzed Amethyst\", with \"Topaz\", \"Blue Blood\", and \"Pigeon Blood\" added later. In 1985 the company ceased batik production and with it, this fabric ceased being produced.",
