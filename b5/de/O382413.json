As well as the Holy Spirit, it also suggests the dove which brought an olive leaf to Noah, signifying man's reconciliation with God after the Flood.  \n\nThe use of a Saint-Esprit in jewellery probably comes from the pendant of the chivalric Ordre du Saint-Esprit.  It was used in traditional costume in other parts of France as well, particularly in the Auvergne, but the Normandy dove is the only one which carries a branch in its beak.  Like many of the Normandy crosses, the Saint-Esprit was usually set with transparent rock crystals, which were found locally.  Although the design is typical of Normandy, this pendant was made in Paris.  French regional jewellery was frequently made in Paris during the 19th century.  It was bought for \u00a33 7s. 6d. at the International Exhibition, London, 1872.",
