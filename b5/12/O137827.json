By introducing a third form between the blade and the handle, I created sinusoidal lines that broke up the symmetry of the piece.  These lines then suggested the shape of the blade.  The broad sweep of the outer edge continues the sinusoidal dynamic with the upper element of the handle.  I was concerned that the blade needed to have similar reference to volume to continue the energy throughout the piece.  A double-skinned blade gave greater volume and allowed the fluid lines to extend to the under side of the blade to create a truly three dimensional piece.  When the upper surface of the blade is flat the eye does not rest at any point when viewing the piece.\"",
