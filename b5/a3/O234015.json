Sprigs like this were made individually before being joined together with other pieces to form decorative patterns.  This type of lace was produced in and around the Honiton area of Devon from the 17th to the 19th century.  \n\nMrs Treadwin ran a business for the repair and reproduction of all types of lace and for the production of Devon laces.  Based at 5 Cathedral Close in Exeter, she undertook several commissions for Queen Victoria and received a Royal appointment in 1848.  As well as producing and selling lace, Mrs Treadwin collected it and in 1869 she offered a large part of her collection to the Royal Albert Memorial Museum, Exeter.  Surviving examples of lace manufactured by Mrs Treadwin during the 1860s incorporate sprigs similar in design to this one.",
