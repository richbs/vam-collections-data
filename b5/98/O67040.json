The silk satin is backed with surface-dyed, originally red, now brick-coloured linen, and all edges are reinforced with faded red silk tapes on the inside. Hand-stitched with originally red silk, now pale pink, and later additions of red silk stitches. Traces of cut thread within the straw design suggest that embellishment, such as corals, beads or even precious stones, has carefully been removed at one point.\nThe piece has been cut from the larger image robe, 393-1896.\n[Image robe] Probably the front of an image robe with sleeves of silk satin, originally red, now faded to cream colour, embroidered with two straw plait (whole straw stalks), couched with yellow silk to form design consisting of floral ornaments with a border along the hem. The sleeves display the \"fleur-de-lys\" pattern similar to the 393-1896. The silk satin is backed with surface-dyed originally red, now brick-coloured linen, and all seams and openings are reinforced with faded red silk tapes on the inside. Hand-stitched with originally red silk, now pale pink, and later additions of red silk stitches.

Along the bottom is a row of conventional floral ornaments. The silk satin is backed with surface-dyed originally red, now brick-coloured, linen, and all seams and openings are reinforced with faded red silk tapes on the inside. Hand-stitched with originally red silk, now pale pink, and later additions of red silk stitches. The sleeves are of different cut and shape, probably adjusted to fit a specific statue. At the back there is a neck yoke of double natural linen. Half of the back and the hem are missing.\nTraces of cut thread and colour changes within the straw design suggest that embellishment, such as corals, beads, or even precious stones, has carefully been removed at one stage.",

            "public_access_description": "This straw plait decorated piece is probably the back of a small image robe (used to dress a religious statue). It was originally of crimson silk satin, but has drastically faded to cream. The robe is embroidered with two straw plait of whole stalks, couched with yellow silk to form a design consisting of scrolls forming ogee-shaped compartments which enclose a fleur-de-lis. Traces of cut thread and discoloured stitch holes within the straw design suggest that precious embellishment has carefully been removed at one point. It is likely that the use of straw was intentional and of specific importance, perhaps dressing religious statues during Michaelmas. Maybe the local saint was dressed in a straw decorated robe to further empower the blessing and protection of next year's harvest.",
