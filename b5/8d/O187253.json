E.1981-1962\n\nThe only immediate military action taken by the Comit\u00e9 Central was to appoint Charles Lullier (1838-91), a man remarkable only for his drunkenness, as Commander of the National Guard. Contrary to what this caricature suggests, he did very little except neurotically defend the H\u00f4tel de Ville from a surprise attack which never came. He failed to occupy Mount Val\u00e9rien, an important fortress for the defence of both Paris and Versailles, when the Regular Army withdrew from it for a few days on 18 March. This oversight seriously contributed to the failure of the communard sortie on 3 April. He was arrested for treachery but escaped from prison and attempted to negotiate with Versailles. After the war he was condemned to death but was later reprieved.'\n<u>Victoria & Albert Museum Department of Prints and Drawings and Department of Paintings, Accessions 1962</u>.
