The elections took place between the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and the reunification of East and West Germany.\n\nThe poster shows an arrow directed to the top right side bearing the inscription 'Mit uns fing es an - B\u00fcrger f\u00fcr B\u00fcrger', which means 'we were the starting point - citizens for citizens'.\n\nAlliance 90 came together for the People\u2019s Chamber elections. It consisted of different groups emerging out of the Citizen's Movement. These were: 'Neues Forum' ('New Forum'), 'Initiative f\u00fcr Frieden und Menschenrechte' ('Initiative for Peace and Human Rights') and 'Demokratie Jetzt' ('Democracy Now'). Later on B\u00fcndnis 90 became a political party. On the 14th of May 1993 it aligned with the party 'Die Gr\u00fcnen' ('The Greens) to become 'B\u00fcndnis 90/Die Gr\u00fcnen' ('Alliance 90/The Greens').\n\nThe Alliance did not do well at the elections for the People's Chamber, although it had been representatives from these groups who managed to provide the moral and intellectual basis for the 'Wende' ('turnaround), often by overcoming state repressions. They were the negotiators at the 'round tables' and provided the basis which led to overthrow of the GDR-system and ultimately the GDR itself.",
