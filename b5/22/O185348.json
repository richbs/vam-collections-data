Alternatively it could be, Sir Thomas Trevor, Baron of the Exchequer (d. 21 December 1656 at the age of 84) or son and heir Sir Thomas Trevor, KB (d. 5 February 1676 at the age of 64).\n\nA coat of arms, or often just called arms, is a design belonging to a particular person or a group of people. It usually consists of a shield, flanked by some supporters on the left and right. Above the shield is a coronet above which is the helmet. On the helmet then sits the crest. It was / is an important device for identification, especially when used with documents.",
