Both men and women used or wore them to publicise the campaign and signal their support for the abolitionist cause.\n\nWedgwood is credited as the originator of the motto on the medallion: 'Am I not a man and a brother?'. He had extensive trading links with Liverpool, the foremost slave port of the day. \n\nTrading\nThe medallions were not sold commercially, and were never listed in the Wedgwood catalogues. Instead, Wedgwood probably bore the cost of their production and distribution. Others of similar size sold at 3 guineas each (\u01533 3s), which gives an indication of the considerable sums involved. They were probably distributed through the Society for the Abolition of Slavery. Certainly, Wedgwood is known to have sent consignments to both the American statesman Benjamin Franklin, who was then President of the Philadelphia Society for the Abolition of Slavery, and Thomas Clarkson, a leading abolitionist and author of  A Summary View of the Slave Trade.",
