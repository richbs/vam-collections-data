E. \"The inscription on the reverse states that this is a miniature of Henry Earl of Northumberland, which is incorrect. The miniature is of Elizabeth's favourite, of which other versions exist (NPG, no. 4966, Burghley House, and in the Royal Collection). It is a lively characteristic of the sitter, and is an important miniature as it marks Essex's break with Hillaird whom he had patronised until then, and the acquisition by Oliver of a major patron. Robert Devereux (1566-1601) eldest son of Walter Devereux, first Earl. Created Knight Banneret for his bravery at Zutphen, 1586, became a favourite of the Queen and Master of the Horse, 1587. In 1596 he defeated the Spanish in a naval battle off Cadiz, on this trip he grew a beard, and it is possible that this miniature was first painted immediately after his return from abroad. He married Frances, the widow of Sir Philip Sidney in 1590. In 1601 he was executed for trying to secure a plot against Elizabeth's counsellors.\"",
