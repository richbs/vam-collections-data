In the 18th century, as the commercial production of such carpets increased and more were available, their price fell and increasingly they were placed on the floor.\n\nMaterials & Making\nIn a pile fabric, such as this carpet, the foundation consists of two sets of threads, warp and weft, which interlace at right-angles. The pile is created by tying a knot of coloured thread around two adjacent warp threads, building up the design row by row while the foundation is being woven by the insertion of weft. It requires only a simple loom, and is easily done by hand.  In this carpet there are 1,280 knots per square decimetre.\n\nDesign & Designing\nUnusually for Turkish carpets, which tend to have geometric designs, the dominant feature of this type of carpet is its large medallion.  This is thought to have been inspired by the medallion designs often found on Turkish book bindings and manuscripts. In this carpet the medallion is not in the centre, but is closer to one end.  This suggests that the weavers could not, or did not, alter the proportions of the design - which was for a longer carpet - but simply stopped weaving when the required length had been achieved. Production of this design continued into the 19th century.",
