            "public_access_description": "The service of the fashionable hot drinks tea, coffee and chocolate was often the focal point of domestic social rituals in the eighteenth-century. Porcelain tea and coffee sets with matching trays (d\u00e9jeuners) were made for one or two persons to serve themselves in private apartments. The design and elaboration of the decoration of the sets signalled their owner\u2019s taste and wealth. \n\nTea and coffee were not served together at the same time, so the same saucers were often used with both tea and coffee cups. The design of tea cups evolved as the eighteenth century progressed, but tea cups were generally lower and more open in shape than coffee cups. However, it is clear from the records at S\u00e8vres that in France at least certain shapes could be used interchangeably for coffee or tea.\n\nThis is one of a small number of tea and coffee sets very finely decorated with scenes from Goethe's novel 'The Sorrows of Young Werther' and made at the Meissen porcelain factory in the late 1780s. All have the same vessel shapes, and certain of the components of the several services are painted with the same subjects and scenes. Some of this decoration is after preliminary design drawings by Johann David Schubert (1761-1822), who worked as teacher of drawing at the factory's drawing school from 1786 and who became principal painter at the factory in 1795, and some of Schubert's designs were in turn copied from prints.",

Wertherporzellan Petersberg : Michale Imhof Verlag GmbH &amp; Co., 2009 ISBN 9783865684592.There are only three full Meissen services known today of this type and all three were shown in this exhibition at Wetzlar Museum. 1328-L are catalogue nos. 7 \u2013 7.12, a very similar service was lent by the W\u00fcrttemburg State Museum in Stuttgart, and another cam from a private collection. The first two have almost identical gilding and decoration, while the third appears unfinished as it has no gilding. This tray is catalogue no. 7.1 pp. 100-101. The scene illustrates the letter dated July 6th of Part I of the novel. It depicts a woodland scene. In a clearing, Lotte is seated on the edge of the well with her sister standing next to her. While she has a drink of water Werther playfully lifts up another younger sister in the centre of the scene. This composition directly copies Schubert\u2019s watercolour sketch, catalogue 29, p. 139. Another version of this scene was published by Schubert as a print in red, see plate 57, p. 51. Another tray with the same scene, dated 1789 is in a private collection currently on loan to the Frankfurter Goethe Museum, see catalogue no. 9, p. 118. There are minor differences only in the colouring of the scene and the border of the tray.\nArts Coucil of Great Britain. <u>The Age of Neoclassicism</u> London, 1972, Cat. 1439",

It is one of a small but important group of items decorated with scenes from a classic of German literature: The Sorrows of Young Werther by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.  Goethe first published <i>Die Leiden des junges Werthe</i><i>r</i> in 1774 when he was only 24.  The novel takes the form of letters written by the young gentleman artist, Werther, to his friend Wilhelm during the course of eight months.  Goethe went on to write many novels, poems and plays which he felt were more worthy of the public\u2019s attention, but it was this short novel which contributed greatly to his fame during his lifetime.  It seemed to capture something of the zeitgeist (spirit of the age) as it is full of extreme emotions and irrational impulses which seemed to embody far more closely the human experience of its readers than the cold rationality of French Neo-classicism permeating fashionable Europe at the time.  The book is now regarded as one of the foremost examples of the reaction in the German-speaking states to the prevailing cultural influences of the French Enlightenment.  This movement is generally known by the phrase <i>Sturm und Drang</i>, (roughly translatable as \u2018storm and stress\u2019), and was a precursor of the German Romantic movement of the late 18th/early 19th centuries.  There was a parallel strain in French culture too, characterised by a marked sentimentality around the themes of familial piety, the innocence of children, unrequited or impossible love and the beauties of nature, as seen in the novels of Rousseau and Diderot and the paintings of Greuze.",

After failing to distance himself from Lotte and his futile love for her, Werther finally chooses suicide as his only release from his torment.",
