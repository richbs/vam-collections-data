The caption for this one reads: \n'The Taj is raised above the terrace on a marble platform 18 feet high and 313 feet square. At each corner is a minaret 133 feet high. The Taj itself contains a central hall under the great dome, in which stand the two tombs, exquisitely carved and inlaid, and surrounded by a perforated screen of white marble. The light is admitted through double windows of perforated marble, and thus subdued to a soft gloom which contributes to mark this mausoleum the most impressive in the world.'",
