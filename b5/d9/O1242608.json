It was hosted by the Royal Society of Arts, Manufacturers and Trade and paid for by the profits of the original South Kensington Great Exhibition (1851). The building was erected near the current site of the Natural History Museum and Science Museum and was intended to remain permanently; however, Parliament declined the Government's wish to buy it and it was deconstructed with the materials being used for the Crystal Palace.\n\nThe Majolica Fountain, designed by Minton, Hollins and Co., was a central tenet of the exhibition. It flaunted the company's premier status as an exponent of durable decorative finishes for walls and floors in churches, public buildings, grand palaces and domestic houses. The fountain itself was made up of 369 seperate parts and stood over 10 metres tall. After the exhibition closed it was displayed at the Bethnal Green Museum (now the Museum of Childhood) from 1872, when the museum opened, until 1962 when the fountain was sold off in parts. The statue of George slaying the dragon from the top is now held at the Potteries Museum in Stoke-on-Trent.",
