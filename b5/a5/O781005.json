This is by John Yenn and shows, at almost full size, a tureen from a large dinner service made to Chambers's design, parts of which survive at Blenheim. The background to the elevation is pale green. The bombe form of the design is indebted to French rococo pieces. The base has a gadrooned foot and a band of reed-and-ribbon moulding. The drawing shows a band of key pattern around the shoulder of the tureen. This was replaced by a Vitruvian scroll during manufacture. The handles are modelled in the form of stylized vegetable stalks. On the drawing they are composed of two pieces, which overlap to create a double thickness where they would be gripped. On the finished tureens this detail is omitted and the handle is made from one stalk only.",

The design by Yenn shows, at almost full size, a tureen from a large dinner service made to Sir William Chambers's (1723-1796) design, parts of which survive at Blenheim. \n\nChambers was born in Sweden and died in London. He travelled widely, visiting China, and studied architecture at the Ecole des Arts, Paris, from 1749 and in Italy from 1750 to 1755.  Many of his drawings from this period are contained in his important 'Franco-Italian' album, held in the V&A.  Chambers moved to London in 1755 and published his influential Treatise on Civil Architecture in 1759.  Chambers demonstrated the breadth of his style in buildings such as Gower (later Carrington) House and Melbourne House, London, in such country houses as Duddingston, Scotland, and in the garden architecture he designed for Wilton House, Wiltshire, and at Kew Gardens. He became head of government building in 1782, and in this capacity built Somerset House, London.",
