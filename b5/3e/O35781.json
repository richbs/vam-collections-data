He had already sprayed on the colour before cutting the wood. The unpainted wood surfaces were oiled. The wheels are pinned through hollow plastic tubes to that they will freely run. The round parts; wheels; funnels; etc.; are turned. The figures are made from different sizes of dowel in piranah pine and the 'women' are made in four parts. The train set and figures were made as part of a series which included cars and boats.",
