This monumental plaster cast was made for the South Kensington Museum (now the V&A), and was and is one of the centrepieces of the Cast Courts in the Museum (accessioned in 1867).  Brucciani himself was a key person in the formation of the cast collection at South Kensington. After the business he had originally founded in Covent Garden encountered difficulties in the early 20th century, it was taken over by the V&A. Brucciani casts then continued to be produced on Museum premises until the 1950s. As such this plaque is part of the history of the formation of the cast collection, as well as an intriguing evocation of one of the protagonists involved in the creation of one of the most important casts in the Museum. In return for his work in making the cast, Brucciani was given by the Dean of Santiago 'a small picture with silver relieve [frame], representing our glorious patron Santiago in the form under which he appeared at the famous battle of Clavijo fighting for the Spaniards against the Moors.' The Dean continued, 'It is far from possessing the artistic merit of the copy received from you [the plaster cast]; but it will always serve as a memorial of your stay in this basilica, and as a proof of the esteem you have succeeded in exciting of this corporation'.",
