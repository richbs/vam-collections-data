Each part consists of a stiff hollow segment made from sheet silver, flat on the inside and curved on the front (giving it a D-shaped section), and shaped like half a circle.  The outside face of each part is decorated with horizontal bands of applied filigree.  There is a band of coil rings along the centre, with a band of alternating lozenges and granule rosettes on either side of it.  The outside rim is a band of beaded wire.  The two parts are the same size, and are hinged together at one end, with tubes made of coiled wire.  At the other end there is a similar screw fastening.  The screw is made from a rod of silver, with a wire wound round it anti-clockwise to form the thread, so that the screw unfastens by turning it to the right.  There is a plaque attached over the front of the fastening, formed from nine cells set with turquoise-coloured glass.  There is a small pyramid of granules at each end of the screw fastening.",
