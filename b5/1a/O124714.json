            "public_access_description": "Print of a design for a fan mount made by an anonymous designer about 1770-1790. The print is a copperplate engraving made for the private use of goldsmiths. It could serve as an aid to producing further designs by modification in pencil, as indeed this design has been altered in this way, or it could be used as a base to try out enamel or gold colours. It could also be shown to potential customers. \n\nFans were fashionable, personal accessories carried by women as part of dress.  The design could have been shown to an elite female client of the Court of Louis XV, King of France, from 1715 to 1774, or that of Louis XVI, King of France from 1774 until 1791, at Versailles, Paris. It is from an album of designs which date from about 1735-1820 and include those for snuffboxes, scent holders, watches and watch cases, spoons, fans and fan mounts, small swords, and chatelaines (ornamental chains, pins, or clasps usually worn at a woman's waist, to which trinkets, keys, purses, or other articles are attached).\n\nThere is a close relationship between the contents of the album and known work by three Parisian goldsmiths, Jean Ducrollay (1710-1787), Pierre- Fran\u00e7ois Drais (active 1761-1788), and Charles Ouizille (1744-1830) whose names appear on the first page of the album. This suggests that all the designs emanate from their workshops.  Drais worked for the Court at Versailles as jeweller to both King Louis XV and Louis XVI. Ouizille worked in this capacity for Louis XVI. Most of the material dates from the period 1755-90.",
