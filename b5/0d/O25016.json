This sculpture depicts the Buddha seated in the 'lotus' meditating position on a mat edged with pearls above a single lotus throne. A large part of the right arm of the figure is missing from below the shoulder to the wrist, his left hand with palm turned upwards resting in his lap is also damaged. A part of the <i>ushnisha</i> is missing and the face has lost its nose and shows other marks of abrasion.\n\nThe Buddha has lowered eyes under the narrow incised curving lines of his eyebrows.  His hair is shown in rows of tight 'snail-shell' curls.  His clinging robe is thrown over his left shoulder in a sinuous curve, with one end terminating in a gently curving row of tight folds just above his left breast. The edge of the robe is shown as a line dipping under his right breast with the opposite edge snaking down his torso.  It is further seen in two encircling ridges above his ankles above the tightly folded fan-shaped hems of the front and back parts of the robe upon which he sits.\n\nHis right hand which is shown touching the earth, although damaged, still bears remnants of webbing between the fingers.  The soles of his feet are marked with two small symbols of the<i> dharma-chakra</i>.",

It shows the Buddha seated in meditation on a lotus throne (\u2018padmasana\u2019) with a \u2018vajra\u2019 (thunderbolt). These features identify it specifically as a \u2018diamond throne\u2019 (\u2018vajrasana\u2019). \n\nThe gesture of the lowered hand position (\u2018bhumisparsa-mudra\u2019) is  significant. It confirms that Shakyamuni is calling the earth to witness his resistance of the temptations of the demonic goddess Mara and the forces of worldly attachments. The combination of the \u2018diamond throne\u2019 and the mudra confirm that this image is intended to depict the historical Buddha at Bodhgaya, immediately prior to his  Enlightenment.\n\nThis posture became a classic attitude in later Buddhist sculpture and was widely emulated elsewhere in the art of Buddhist Asia. Few monumental images of the Buddha survive from eastern India. Buddhism, weakened by the arrival of popular Hinduism and by Muslim invasions, was nearing collapse in the region at this time. Later, medieval Hinduism re-absorbed the Buddha as a divine incarnation (\u2018avatara\u2019) of Vishnu, and many Buddha images of the Pala period (about 760-1142) appear to have been worshipped in this form.",
