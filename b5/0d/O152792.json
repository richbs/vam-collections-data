            "public_access_description": "Wendy Ramshaw is a leading and internationally renowned artist jeweller, who never ceases to experiment with a diverse range of materials and new technologies. Artistically always ahead of her time, her designs are distinctive and innovative. She first trained in illustration and textile design. Her early jewellery, made in the early 1960s with her husband David Watkins, used screen-printed acrylic and paper. \n\nIn about 1970 she turned to working in silver and gold, rapidly establishing a distinctive minimalist style influenced by modernism and industrial design. Its linear purity and decisive blocks of colour, along with the in-built versatility of her work, gained her the Council of Industrial Design Award in 1972. \n\nThe ring sets have become her trademark and exemplify two new concepts. The wearer is involved in the design process and also has ultimate choice in how to combine the individual elements of the ring on the hand. In its complete state and mounted on a decorative stand, the ring becomes a sculptural object.\n\nHer early ring sets or so-called 'pillar rings' with spire-shaped bezels are inspired by the Space Age and urban developments of the late sixties in Britain. The gemstones and their compositions reflect elements of Constructivism.",
