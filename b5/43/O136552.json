            "public_access_description": "Lilian Hocknell (ca. 1891-1977) produced a considerable body of illustrative work, mainly in the form of advertising artwork and book illustration.  One of her best-known working relationships was with Chilprufe Ltd, a leading UK manufacturer of children's clothing, and this illustration was produced for use in their catalogues and advertisements.\n\nThe Chilprufe (originally Chillproof) brand was founded by John Adams Bolton (1867-1945) in Leicester in 1906.  Chilprufe garments were of high quality, were good value and were very much in mainstream taste for the first sixty years of the twentieth century.  Although the company also produced garments for adults, and a range of children's outer clothing under the brand name 'Pobbie', it is best remembered for children's underwear.",
