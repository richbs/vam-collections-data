This photograph shows the set for the Hydro at Aix-and-Pains, designed by Julian Hicks in the Christmas 1900 production of The Sleeping Beauty and the Beast starring Dan Leno and Herbert Campbell.\n\nDescribed by the reviewer of The Era as 'the most artistic annual that Mr. Collins has ever done at Drury Lane', the scenes included Robert Caney's wooden glade for the Fairy Parliament, Henry Emden's pastoral landscapes of English countryside at different times of the year, McCleery's sophisticated Royal Aviary followed by his Tangled Forest and Bruce Smith's Enchanted Crystal Garden in the palace of the Beast complete with Stanley's illuminated fountains. It culminated with Bruce Smith's luxuriant Grand Transformation of Beauty's Wedding Gifts followed by a Harlequinade starring the popular Victorian clown Whimsical Walker.",
