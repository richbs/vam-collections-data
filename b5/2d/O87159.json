Two girls sit in a garden with rose trellis and lake behind, while Cupid aims his arrow at one of them.  Such an idealised outdoor scene is typical of the pastoral views popular on 18th-century fans.  \n\nThe ivory sticks are carved and painted, and the guards are articulated; that is, they each contain six portraits, and by sliding a thumb-piece show alternately either portraits of three girls or of three youths.
