There is a diamond shaped opening under each arm. Small stand-up collar nicely seamed around the neck. Very wide opening at the front tapering to the bottom; no overlap.\nMain fabric: 'gold' ground [silver-gilt close S-wound on a yellow silk core]. White leaves form an ogival lattice with a 4-petalled flowerhead where the lines meet.  There are two types of floral spray in rows: [1] green leaves, pink flower which is not quite open and two large and two small buds; [2] round pink flower, fully opened, surrounded by 4 round buds and 2 flowers; green leaves.\nLining: roller printed cotton with a pink and red marble effect; faded at the front opening.\nFacing: striped woollen: red and white stripes each with a small floral sprig. There is evidence of an interlining under the facing - it has no pattern and seems to be a white fabric woven with a silver metal thread.",
