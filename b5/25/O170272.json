Many of his drawings are now in Marseilles (Biblioth\u00e8que Municipale) but SD.272:1-61 comprises a set almost certainly purchased by Robert Hay, probably in 1827 for 12,000 francs (see Coste, 1878, p.44).  Hay's intention to publish these drawings led to protracted negotiations between himself, Coste, and E.W. Lane acting as intermediary, revealed in a series of letters from Lane to Hay (see Tillett, 1984, pp.43-5).  Eventually communications between Coste and Hay broke down and Coste had his own set of the Cairo drawings engraved and published in Architecture Arabe ou Monuments du Kaire, 1837 (without text) and 1839 (with text).  Although Hay's set of Coste's drawings were never published, they were consulted for Hay's own publication, Illustrations of Cairo, 1840 (see Pl.XIII and text, and Pl.XV) and for the illustrations, by William Harvey, for Lane's The Arabian Nights'Entertainments, 3 vols, 1839-41 (see Preface p.xxii).  Hay retained Coste's drawings until his death in 1863 and in 1873 his son offered them to the BM (see Tillett, 1984, p.108 and correspondence in Searight Archive).  Shortly afterwards they were bound in the present volume, in no apparent order. Their subsequent history until their appearance on the art market in 1977 is obscure.  The plates in Coste's Architecture Arabe were engraved by Hibon (probably Auguste Hibon, 1780-1857) and E. Ollivier (probably Emile Edmond Ollivier 1800-1864) after his own versions of many of the drawings in SD.272:1-61.  For fuller details see Searight Archive. (Many of the plates in Architecture Arabe are the source for plates in M.J. Marcel, \u00c9gypte Depuis La Conqu\u00e8te Des Arabes jusqu'a la domination Fran\u00e7aise, Paris, 1872.)\nN.
