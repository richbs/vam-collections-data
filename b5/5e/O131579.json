NUNO designers are renowned for their ability to develop and apply the latest technology to textile design and manufacture.  However, much of their work is also based on traditional Japanese textile techniques and aesthetics, and it is this fusion of the traditional with the contemporary that makes NUNO fabrics so innovative.\n\nThis white sample swatch is made of woven, flocked polyester. This technique of flocking is achieved by blowing tiny lengths of rayon, nylon and other electron bearing fibres across the surface of woven polyester. The fibres are fixed in place by means of electrostatic charges, and the resulting pattern stands out in relief against a transparent ground.",
