It was under the control of the Venetian Quirini family for several hundred years, until the mid 16th century, and its range of embroidery styles show some Italian influence. This piece, however, has a design based on the Turkish mosque and cypress tree pattern, although in this case the building depicted has a cross on top, and may represennt a christian church or monastry. It also has a double headed eagle derived from Byzantine decoration. Both of these elements are found on other examples of this type of scarf or towel. The smaller birds along its edges represent partridges or doves.",
