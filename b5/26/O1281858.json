Henderson had bought it as the cinema the Palais de Luxe in 1930, had it remodelled by the architect Howard Jones and re-named it The Windmill but the Revudeville shows with their 'tasteful' immobile tableaux of near-naked glamour girls made it a legendary success.\n\nOn her death in 1944 Henderson bequeathed it to Van Damm who ran it until his death in December 1960, when he left it to his daughter the rall driver Sheila Van Damm. The theatre closed officially on 31st October 1964.",
