(The brass is attached to a slab with an inscription to Anne, eldest daughter of W. Harborne, wife of Clere Talbot, LL.D. (d.1649)). Dunston Church, Norfolk. (M.S. I.)\n<i>Rubbings.\n</i>E.1284-1926\nPresented by Nicolas E. Toke, Esq.\n\n<i>Note:-</i> Mill Stephenson, in \"Monumental Brasses in the British Isles\" (1926) says that \"the brass is usually assigned to Clere Talbot, LL.D. and his two wives. Mr. Toke says: \"It is clear that the inscription (on the slab) has nothing to do with the brasses, which are of a much earlier date, probably about 1570. The stone appears to have been utilised for the inscription to Dr. Talbot's wife without any attempt being made to remove the brasses. Haines ('Manual of Monumental Brasses,' 1861) says that the brass is probably a palimpsest, and he is almost certainly right, judging by the unutilised space round the head of the male figure.\"'\n'",
