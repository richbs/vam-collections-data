The set includes four soldiers marching with rifles, as well as an officer and colour (flag) bearer. They are made from tin, which has been solid cast and then hand-painted. They were manufactured as an accurate representation of soldiers in the, at the time of manufacture, newly-formed Israeli Army. The set reflects the trend amongst toy soldier manufacturers to mirror the real world in terms of new armies, regiments, and changes in uniform and equipment. They would have been played with by children, but would also have been bought by toy-soldier collectors.",
