Its evocation of panic-stricken flight in a devastated world is immediate; the image of a makeshift ladder poised above this catastrophic scene suggests the promise of rescue offered by this worthy cause.\n\nNils Burwitz was born in Swinemunde in Germany in 1940. He emigrated to South Africa in 1958 and settled in the Balearic Islands in 1976. Burwitz studied in Johannesburg, graduating in 1963. He has joined with distinguished writers, musicians, artists and statesmen in the fight against Apartheid. His experience in the struggle for freedom, and his travels between Europe and Africa, have made him a sensitive observer of society and its concerns, committed to improving its ills and building fresh cultural links across the Continents.",
