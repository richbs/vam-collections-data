Illustrated p. 10, referred to p. 10\nText p. 10 'The present work has grown out of and uses some of the photographs of earlier essays. Its immediate beginning was in a visit to the Strand in April 1983 [date of this work]. This seaside resort near Cape Town had long been popular with up-country Afrikaners. Some owned holiday cottages or had retired there, others had built blocks of flats; lodges, hotels, shops, and cafes catered especially to Afrikaners and there were several Afrikaner Protestant churches. The town was heavily invested with 'Afrikaansness', and I was attracted by the variety and strength of the ways in which this had been expressed in its buildings. After a few days of intense photography I decided to explore our structural heritage more generally, and by the end of that year I had bought a camper to enable me to do this more easily. Then, for some years, whenever I could get away, I criss-crossed South Africa seeking out and photographing structures.'",
