She has embarked from a <i>maur-pankhi</i> (peacock-shaped pinnace), which is partly visible on the river.\n\nThe composition has the influence of European watercolour technique, this is particularly affecting the central tree in the picture and the stacks of cloud above. Another interesting aspect of the picture is the roof of the hut, which has tiles rather than thatch.",

A similar subject to the previous painting, this painting shows the interesting European influence on the Murshidabad style after c.1770, particularly in the efforts to show spatial recession and in the water-colourist's techniques seen in the handling of the central tree and cloudy sky.",
