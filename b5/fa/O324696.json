It is not known exactly when this became technically possible, but it was probably in the course of the 15th century. Firebacks survive  which can be dated to the 16th century. They were used at the back of fireplaces, which were newly fashionable, and these firebacks served both to throw the heat of the fire forward into a room and to protect the brickwork. The patterns on firebacks were created by pressing one or more pattern-moulds into a bed of sand. After removing the moulds, the liquid iron was then poured in and allowed to cool. Coats of arms, badges and initials were popular motifs on firebacks\n\n Moulds for firebacks were generally of carved wood, but a fireback can itself act as a mould, perpetuating the same design for many generations, and sometimes making the dating of an iron fireback an inexact science. Firebacks can be made more difficult to date, as several popular designs were replicated in the 1920s and 30s .",

            "history_note": "Iron to be used for casting had to be heated to liquid form, which required a very high temperature. It is not known exactly when this became technically possible, but it was probably in the course of the 15th century. Firebacks survive  which can be dated to the 16th century. They were used at the back of fireplaces, which were newly fashionable, and these firebacks served both to throw the heat of the fire forward into a room and to protect the brickwork. The patterns on firebacks were created by pressing one or more pattern-moulds into a bed of sand. After removing the moulds, the liquid iron was then poured in and allowed to cool. \n\n Moulds for firebacks were generally of carved wood, but a fireback can itself act as a mould, perpetuating the same design for many generations, and sometimes making the dating of an iron fireback an inexact science. Firebacks can be made more difficult to date, as several popular designs were replicated in the  1920s and 30s .",
