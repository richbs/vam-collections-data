In the Syrian region, which incorporated much of Palestine, Jordan and Lebanon as well as Syria itself in the 19th century, they were worn by all sections of society, from townswomen to the nomadic Bedouin of the desert.  The designs vary by sector and show influences from a wide area, reflecting Syria\u2019s strong trading traditions and central location.\n\nBracelets of complex interlocking wire, like this one, were mainly worn by women in the rich cities.  This use of flexible wire is Ottoman in origin, and is characteristic of Syrian bracelets of the 19th century.  This example was bought for five shillings and sixpence (the pair) at the International Exhibition, London, in 1872.  Its name was recorded as \u2018ussuar\u2019, which is a generic Arabic name for bracelets in the region.",
