Washington described these \"wall platters\" thus: \"Clay is stoneware but the firings vary from 1260 degrees C down to 800 degrees C ie. each is multifired eg. 3-4 times. Subject is \"The Elements\" in all. Wheel-thrown or made on slabber. Decoration includes slips & engobes, other clays, enamels - anything which stands the kiln fire which is usually oxydising. They are my first attempts to break free from the vessel and yet remain a potter.\" (see references).",
