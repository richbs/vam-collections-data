The ground of each compartment is crosshatched with  metal thread which surrounds a large boteh motif outlined with a leafy stem in metal thread, terminating in a red blossom and infilled with a flowering stem with pink, red and green blossoms. The botehs faced alternate directions in alternate rows.\nWarp: blue silk\nWeft: red, pink, green silk\nMetal thread: silver strip open S-wound on yellow silk.\n\nThere are squares of a different, pieced, fabric added to the corners.  These have a dark blue satin field decorated with offset rows of botehs delineated by two heavy outlines and infilled with a 12-petalled rosette and tulip, all in metal thread. In alternate rows the botehs face alternate directions.\nWarp: dark blue silk\nWeft: red silk\nMetal thread: untarnished silver-gilt [?] strip open S-wound on yellow silk and also on white silk.\n\nA pieced border joins the corner squares.  It has a  red plain weave ground with strong weft rib, decorated with interlocked lozenge lattice formed by leafy stems and similar cross hatching as in the main field, in metal thread. Each lozenge is decorated with a 5-petalled rosette, asymmetrically placed, carried on a leafy stem sprouting from the lozenge frame.  The rosettes are in three colours: blue, green and pink.\nWarp: red silk\nWeft: blue, green and pink silk.\nMetal thread: silver strip open  S-wound on yellow silk.  \n\nFacing: black bias cut silk satin\nBacking: white ground printed with a repeating pattern of narrow stripes each separated  by a very narrow black and white stripe:\n[1] blue with isolated flowering plants in red and green with white details\n[2] yellow with delicate black leafy meander with white leaves and red flowers and buds\n[3] red with blue and green plant with white details\n[4] white ground as [2] but with green leaves\nThe printing is not perfectly registered.",
