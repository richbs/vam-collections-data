It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years. Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nLa Poup\u00e9e, the comic opera by Arthur Sturgess with music by Edmond Audran, was first produced in London in 1897. Mark Lester played Hilarius in the Daly's Theatre production which opened in December 1931 and toured in 1932. Lester first appeared on the London stage in 1911, and spent four years touring with George Edwardes's companies, appearing in musical comedies. He also played General Malona in The Maid of the Mountains at Daly's Theatre from 1917 until 1920.",
