Potters in the town produced many coffee cups to meet the demand created by the popular drink. Fancier K\u00fctahya wares like this piece were eventually outclassed by the fine porcelain cups made at Meissen in Germany.\n\nThe town of K\u00fctahya had a long tradition of making pottery. In the 16th and 17th centuries, it was overshadowed by Iznik in north-west Anatolia. But in the 18th century, after the industry in Iznik collapsed, K\u00fctahya became the main centre for fritware production in Turkey.",
