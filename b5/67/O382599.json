The Bishariya are a nomadic tribe living in the eastern desert south of the Red Sea, in southern Egypt and northern Sudan.\n\nAlthough the Bishariya often used gold for their traditional jewellery, unlike almost all other Muslim tribal women, they also used silver, particularly for amulets.  This pendant was worn as an amulet, as its name hafayid, which means \u2018for protection\u2019, shows.  Engraved discs like these are now usually threaded on a necklace, but this was traditionally worn hanging down from the centre of a necklace by a braided leather strap which still survives on this example.",
