A contemporary reviewer  noted that Harry Nicholls was 'artistically made-up as the fair, florid sister Thisbe, with golden hair, a taste for sentimental poetry, and a fine affectation of frisky diffidence, having nothing in common with her dark sister except their common hatred of Cinderella'.\n\nThe designer Wilhelm (William Charles Pitcher RI, 1858-1925) was one of the most inventive and prolific late 19th century costume designers, whose early passion for stage spectacle led to his employment designing pantomime costumes for Drury Lane Theatre.  His attention to detail and his ability to create visually stunning and decorative costumes, were aspects of his work that appealed to producers and public alike, and led to a constant stream of work.",

The costume design was executed for a production of <i>Cinderella</i> produced by Oscar Barrett, written by Geoffrey Thorn at the Garrick Theatre, 1897-1897, opening 27 December 1897.  The cast starred Grace Dudley as Cinderella; Harry Nicholls and John Le Hay as Thisbe and Clorinda, Helen Bertram as Prince Felix, Florrie Harmon as Dandini, Lillie Thurlow as Fernando, William Lugg as Baron Pumpolino and Cicely Richards as the Fairy Godmother.\n\nHistorical significance: Wilhelm (William Charles Pitcher RI, 1858-1925) was one of the most inventive and prolific late 19th century costume designers whose early passion for stage spectacle led to his employment designing pantomime costumes for Drury Lane Theatre.  His attention to detail and ability to create visually stunning and decorative costumes were aspects of his work that appealed to producers and public alike, and led to his constant stream of work throughout his life.  He was a well known illustrator of children's books as well as a costume designer, but it was his detailed and superbly decorative designs for the Empire Theatre ballet costumes from 1908 to 1915, led to an obituary writer noting: 'The name C. Wilhelm should be written in gold on the history of ballet'.",
