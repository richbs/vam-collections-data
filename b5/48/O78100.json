The sharp-edged bowl helps to cut or 'nip' sugar from the large, irregularly shaped loaves sugar was sold in. Sugar nippers generally have a scissor-like shape rather than the later U-shaped sugar tongs. They were often supplied with a set of tea spoons or as part of a boxed set containing caddies, spoons and nippers.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe shell-shaped bowls and scrolling handles show the influence of Rococo design. Marine motifs such as shells, waves or sea creatures were especially popular in Rococo silver. It has also been suggested that the shell shape of tea scoops and sugar nippers refers to the custom of placing a scallop shell in a tea crate to allow the tea to be sampled.\n\nPeople\nThe silversmith Thomas Jackson was apprenticed to William Soame of the Mercers Company in 1729 on payment of a fee of \u00a320. He became free of the Company in 1736 (i.e., completed his apprenticeship) and worked in London for a number of years subsequently.",
