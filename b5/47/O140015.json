O Brackett (25/2/1921) accepted that the four pieces were Italian 16th century, and singled out the small mirror W.102-1921 as 'particularly...a fine piece of work and a type unrepresented in the Museum'. The ceramics, manuscripts and certain bronzes were highly regarded by the Museum, while the Metalwork curator noted that 'a large number of pieces of doubtful if not fraudulent character' as well as fine quality works were being offered, but that they should be accepted nonetheless. No other significant information relating to FWK objects found on acquisition papers (3/2008). Currie was described in a newspaper obituary as 'a familiar figure in Continental sale rooms and at Christie's'.",
