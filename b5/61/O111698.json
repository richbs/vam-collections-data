Enclosing the field on two of its sides are broadbands of repeated red fish and red and blue trefoils. The remainder two sides of the field are enclosed by broadbands depicting repeated red leaf and red and blue trefoils.

ISBN 0 85488 047 X\nCoverlet ('kantha')\nAcquired at Dumka; said to have been made by a woman of the Rajmahal Hills/ about 1897\nWhite cotton, quilted and embroidered with white, red, blue, yellow and buff cotton, mainly in running stich/ 200 x 127cm\nIn past centuries the name 'kantha' was used in Bengal to describe quilted embroidered coverlets of various kinds, including some made for export. It is now applied specifically to a type of domestic embroidery made by country women for use within the family circle. Used for different purposes according to size and shape, the 'kantha' like the early patchwork quilts of Britain and North America, utilized the best parts of discarded clothing. Old saris of white cotton, with coloured borders, were pieced together to form the ground fabric, sometimes several layers thick. The coloured borders provided embroidery thread, drawn out carefully, strand by strand. Simple 'kanthas' were made by women of all classes, but the best came from women of the weaver castes, 'Tanti' and 'Kayastha'. Designed by the women themselves, 'kanthas' are infused with the vitality and spontaneity of folk art. Some illustrate Hindu myth and ritual, some show scenes of everyday life, while a third group, from which this example is drawn, depicts archaic figures of human beings, animals and birds surrounded by a stylized plant forms and variety of symbolic objects. The central medallion which appears on most 'kanthas' has links with the complex 'alpana' designs which the women draw in rice paste on the floors of their houses. No 'kantha' is known to survive from before the 19th century. As late as 1850 it was stated that the only Hindus who did needle embroidery in Bengal were of the 'Dhobi' caste and mainly women. If this statement can be accepted as factual, it seems to suggest a possibility that 'Dhobi' women were the first 'kantha' embroideresses. Certainly 'kantha' was originally a poor persons' art, and 'Dhobis' would have been in a unique position to obtain supplies of saris too fragile to stand further laundering. However, by the turn of the century and probably earlier, 'kantha' design had reached its peak in the hands of 'Tanti' and 'Kayastha' women, only to share almost immediately in the general decline of traditional arts and crafts.",
