            "public_access_description": "This lidded basin was almost certainly a bowl for sugar because its decoration matches a French teapot of the same date (also in the V&amp;A). This suggests both were part of the same tea service. The sugar in this bowl was served in lumps, as there is no hole pierced in the lid to accommodate a spoon. Unlike seventeenth-century sugar boxes, this bowl has no lock, which reflects the falling price of sugar during the eighteenth century.\nThe delicately-cast festoons of flowers and leaves around the bowl and lid, and the fasces (a bound bundle of rods) ornament around the rim of the lid are common decorative motifs found in books of ornament designs in the first half of the eighteenth century. This is a refined and restrained example of a decorative style labelled 'rococo' by nineteenth-century art historians. The rococo style developed across Europe in the first half of the eighteenth century. It was a style characterised by the use of ornament designs drawn from the natural world, particularly flowers, leaves and marine motifs such as shells. These types of ornament are present around the bowl and lid of this example; the finial on the lid combines curving, cast cockle shells with a central cabbage-like motif.\nLidded sugar bowls, typically in the form of small pots like this one, were known as 'pots de sucre' in eighteenth-century France. They were usually placed on a low stand and the one for this bowl has been lost. There is a similarly-shaped sugar bowl of porcelain (mounted in silver-gilt) in the toilet service presented by Louis XV to his wife Marie Leczinska to celebrate the birth of their first son in 1729 (now in the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre).\nJean-Baptiste de Lens, the goldsmith whose mark appears on the lid and bowl, was the son of a  goldsmith and worked in Paris. He became a master goldsmith in 1712, when he took as his mark a crowned fleur-de-lys with his initials, 'J D L', a head and two pellets. He died in 1759.",
