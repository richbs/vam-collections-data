The silver masks and sprays of flowers were cast separately and then applied to the salver.\n\nWhen the Catholic King Louis XIV revoked the religiously tolerant Edict of Nantes in 1685, Huguenots (French Protestants) were forced to leave the country. Many were craftsmen who settled in London.  Their technical skills and fashionable French style ensured the luxury silver, furniture, watches and jewellery they made were highly sought after.  Huguenot specialists transformed English silver by introducing higher standards of craftsmanship. They promoted new forms, such as the soup tureen and sauceboat, and introduced a new repertoire of ornament, with cast sculptural details and exquisite engraving.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",

The exact arms depicted here -<i>Gules, on a fess or between three crescents as many mullets</i> - are not recorded; the closest, blazoned <i>Argent, on a fess between three crescents gules as many mullets argent</i> (or <i>or</i>), are for Ashborne or Asherburn (Schroder, T., 1988, p.242).\n\nProvenance: Purchased from S. J. Phillips, Ltd., London, 1982.\n\nHistorical significance: No salver identical to this is known among the works of Paul de Lamerie, although various comparable examples may be cited: a less elaborate salver of 1725 is illustrated by Phillips (1935, pl. CX), as is a salad dish of 1725 (Phillips, 1935, pl. XLV) with very similar masks and foliage sprays applied to the border. The eccentric cast feet issuing from grotesque masks are also found in a variety of contexts, including a kettle stand of 1737 in the Gilbert Collection (1996.870, cat. no. 58, Schroder, 1988, pp.229-30). Although the style of the flat-chasing is typical of Paul de Lamerie, the engraved cartouche is unusual. The imaginative use of waterfall motifs in the design may have been inspired by the engravings of Jacques de Lajoue (see Roland Michel, 1982, fig. 200). (Schroder, T., 1988, p.242.)",
