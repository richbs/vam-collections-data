They first appeared in the 1780s as part of the general refinement of dining customs among the middle classes. Silversmiths initially explored a variety of designs, including articulated racks, before the simple arrangement of parallel arches became standard.\n\nThis example is made of Sheffield plate, a thin layer of silver fused onto a copper core. From the 1760s fused plate wire of varying diameters was made in the rolling mills. Manufacturers of toast racks took advantage of improvements in the manufacture of fused plate wire and many of their pieces are made almost entirely of sections of wire soldered together. Wirework objects and dishes first became popular in the 1780s and continued to be manufactured well into the 19th century.",
