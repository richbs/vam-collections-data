            "physical_description": "Red plastic 'Thunderbird 3' rocket, with small figure, a plastic 'wrist communicator', cardboard packaging with clear plastic window and printed instructions.\n[instructions] Instruction sheet, text and diagrams printed in black on one side of a white sheet of A4 paper, with grey background. The sheet has been folded twice.\n[box] Printed cardboard box with three cardboard inserts, moulded clear plastic support and plastic bags. The front of the box has the 'Thunderbirds' logo in red and grey text against a yellow background in the top-right corner, with a photograph of the 'Thunderbird 3' product against a blue background. Four photographs of the product being played with run down the right-hand side, and five photographs of the rocket and characters from the original TV series run down the left-hand side. There is also a small round window of clear plastic through which the wrist communicator can be seen. The reverse of the box has the same 'Thunderbirds' logo, as well as photographs of the product and text, in yellow, red and blue, describing it. There are also photographs of related Thunderbirds products. The sides and ends of the box repeat the 'Thunderbirds' logo, and have photographs of the product in use, the sides showing the rocket, the ends of the rocket and wrist communicator. The box is glued together, the inside plain, untreated cardboard.\n[wrist communicator] Wrist-watch shaped 'communicator' with a grey rubberised plastic strap, lozenge-shaped red plastic base, circular blue plastic body and silver plastic hinged circular lid which opens to reveal a silver plastic grill with the 'International Rescue' logo in the middle. The top of the lid has the 'Thunderbirds' logo in red text, with a red plastic circle with three fins emanating from it on the inside of the lid. The 'International Rescue' logo is moulded into each half of the strap, which has eight holes in one half, and three raised rounded teeth on the other half. The blue body has one silver and two red buttons, one of which activates one of five recordings of famous phrases from the original TV series when pressed. The red base has four yellow painted buttons, and grooved edge. The speaker and batteries are housed within the body of the watch, which is held together by four metal screws, one in each corner of the base.\n[figure] Small, plastic figure, representing Alan Tracy, jointed at the hips and knees and dressed in a uniform of light blue with white sash, with wing detail in black, and belt and white-ringed boots. Also a light blue double-peaked cap, edged in white with 'IR' in white text within a black oval. The hands and face are pink, with blonde-yellow hair and the facial details are picked out in black, white and pink. When seated in the pilot's seat, the figure's arms rest on the control, console.\n[toy rocket] Red plastic Thunderbird 3 rocket, with grey plastic fins arranged around its centre and a dark grey plastic base with moulded lines radiating from centre. It has three rockets, attached to its base and by arms further up its hull, each with white nose and tail and black hoop. There is a white, ridged hoop towards the nose of the rocket, and 'Thunderbird' is written along its hull in white text, with the number '3' in larger white text on its base with a further '3' in black on each rocket. The nose cone is made of rubberised red plastic. There is a red button on the base of one of the rockets, another on the side of the base, which activate 'rocket' sounds when pressed. A hatch in the grey fin section opens vertically on a hinge to reveal printed stickers representing the internal workings of a rocket and a green plastic sofa on a lift. This can be moved up and down by turning a plastic wheel emerging from just below the fin segment. This lift connects to a second compartment, accessed through a second vertically-hinged hatch towards the nose of the rocket. This again contains printed stickers representing the internal workings of a rocket, as well as the pilot's seat and control console, moulded in yellow plastic with stickers representing flight controls. This can be slid part-way out of the rocket to allow a figure to be inserted. The sections of the rocket are held in place by three metal screws, recessed. Batteries can be inserted by removing the metal screw and dark-grey plate on the base of the rocket.",

It followed the exploits of International Rescue, an organisation that used technically advanced equipment to help those in need.\n\nOriginal Thunderbirds toys are now highly sought after by collectors, and the TV series and associated toys have undergone several revivals amongst subsequent generations of children. This set, made from plastic, features Thunderbird 3, with a figure of Alan Tracy and a 'wrist communicator' which includes recordings of famous phrases from the original programmes, activated by pressing a button. It was produced in China for the toy distributors Vivid Imaginations to coincide with the 40th anniversary of Thunderbirds first appearing on TV.",
