In Russia in the 16th and 17th centuries both men and women wore them, and some silversmiths worked exclusively as earring makers.  By the 19th century they were only worn by women.  \n\nFrom the early 18th century the design of Russian earrings followed two paths.  The Russian aristocracy increasingly wore earrings of international design, but the rural population kept to the old traditional patterns.  These were made by local silversmiths, who rarely marked their work.  As a result, it is very difficult to tell the difference between old earrings and traditional earrings in the old style.\n\nEarrings of this type, with square pendants set with stones, suspended by a hinge from a traditional circular wire, first appeared at the end of the 17th century.  They went out of aristocratic use in the 18th century, but continued in use with traditional dress.  Traditional Slav earrings are often joined together by a long chain, which hangs under the chin.  These may date from the late 17th century, but it is more likely that they were made for traditional costume in the 19th century.\n\nThey were bought from the Russian Commissioner at the Fisheries Exhibition, London, 1883.",
