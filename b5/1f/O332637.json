This object can, therefore, be identified as 19th century.\n\nOn Georges Pull:\nTHE SCHOOL OF PARIS\nThe reputation of Avisseau and the School of Tours encouraged other ceramists to emulate their success. The first of these, Victor Barbizet (c.1805-c.1870), a merchant in Dijon, established a pottery workshop with his brother-in-law, Claude Ponet, to produce household ceramics. Around 1850, together with Barbizet's son, Achille, they moved to Paris and began to mass-produce rustic ware. Over a period of about thirty years, the firm became very successful employing approximately sixty workers at its peak. Victor Barbizet is generally credited with founding the School of Paris.\nThe most famous potter from the School of Paris, Georges Pull (1810-1889), a former soldier and naturalist, was born in Wissembourg, Alsace. He moved to Paris and operated his first kiln in 1856 at the age of forty-six on the rue de Vaugirard which later became the Parisian center for ceramic production. The talented and gifted Pull studied assiduously and apprenticed four years perfecting his skills. From 1860 to 1867, he produced magnificent work with brilliant enamels and was called by one journalist, \"the King of Pottery.\"\nInspired by Georges Pull, Thomas-Victor Sergent (fl.c.1870-1880), a Parisian ceramist, opened his own shop and produced works in the Avisseau tradition. It is likely that Sergent was familiar with the Vaugirard workshops as his enamels were nearly as brilliant as Pull's. He is best known for his platters and plates featuring nearly life-size crustaceans in a varied color palette.\nFran\u00e7ois Maurice (fl.c.1875-1885), a lesser known artist preferred more serene compositions using molded fish and crayfish on a cobalt blue background. His works employ modest hand-finishing imparting minimal detail t",
