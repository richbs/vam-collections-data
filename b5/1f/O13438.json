In cut, fabric and design they were the height of fashion.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe pattern on the silk is hand-painted. The fabric was first sized with alum to make the paint adhere. Next the design was drawn freehand in ink or silverpoint. A variety of pigments were used, including white lead or a chalk ground for the highlights. The robe and petticoat are hand sewn with silk thread and trimmed with gathered strips of the hand-painted silk.\n\nTime\nThe style and design of this ensemble exemplify the Rococo fashion in dress.  The pale yellow silk painted in a variety of bright colours reflects the Rococo palette, while the scalloped sleeve cuffs and gathered robings create a decorative surface pattern. The robe is a sack back (a style of gown with the fabric at the back arranged in box pleats at the shoulders and falling loose to the floor with a slight train), and would have been worn with a wide square hoop under the petticoat.\n\nPlaces\nThe silk was woven and painted in China. The width of the fabric and the use of coloured threads in the selvedge (the cloth edge) differ from European silks. The floral pattern shows the influence of Western design, indicating that it was made expressly for the European market.",

It illustrates the popularity of imported painted silks and the influence of Chinoiserie on dress.  The width of the silk, 28&1/2 inches or 72.5 cm, and the use of coloured threads in the selvedge indicate that the silk was woven in China.  It was most likely painted there, in a very westernised floral pattern.  The sack back style for a wide square hoop indicates formal daywear.  The buttoned stomacher and waist seam are typical of the 1760s while the triple sleeve ruffle is more typical of the 1750s and therefore reinforces its formality.",
