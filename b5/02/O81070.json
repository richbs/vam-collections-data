            "public_access_description": "This photograph shows one of Julia Margaret Cameron\u2019s housemaids, Mary Anne Hillier (1845-1936). She is posed to illustrate the religious legend of St Agnes Eve, which tells of the evening that virgins dream of their future husbands. \n\nThe British poet John Keats (1795-1821) wrote in his poem \u2018The Eve of St Agnes\u2019 (1820):\n\nThey told her how, upon St Agnes\u2019 Eve,\nYoung virgins might have visions of delight,\nAnd soft adorings from their loves receive\nUpon the honey\u2019d middle of the night,\nIf ceremonies due they did aright\nAs supperless to bed they must retire,\nAnd couch supine their beauties, lily white\nNor Look behind, nor sideways, but require\nOf Heaven with upward eyes for all that they desire.\n\nCameron\u2019s close friend and neighbour, Alfred Tennyson (1809-1892), also wrote a poem about St Agnes Eve, in which St Agnes proclaims \u2018For me the Heavenly Bridegroom waits, To make me pure of sin\u2019, indicating a sacred union with Christ. Cameron was staunchly Christian and the expression of religious faith and divine iconography is one of the main preoccupations of her photography. The subject also indicates her interest in literary illustration. She made another photograph from the sitting, also called St Agnes, in which Hillier appears in the same costume and pose but with her eyes averted downwards in prayer. \n\nHillier was one of Cameron\u2019s favourite models and appeared so frequently in the guise of Madonna that she was known as \u2018Mary Madonna\u2019.  In her biographical statement Annals of my Glass House, Cameron wrote that Hillier \u2018has been one of the most beautiful and constant of my models, and in every manner of form has her face been reproduced, yet never has it been felt that the grace of the fashion of it has perished\u2026The very unusual attributes of her character and complexion of her mind\u2026are the wonder of those whose life is blended with ours as intimate friends of the house.\u2019",
