A design of interlaced, knotting stems with two stylised honesty seed pods is set in front of the handles moulded on the base of the tray.  The surface has an imitation beaten finish.\n\nDesign & Designing \nThe designs for the Tudric range, as with the Cymric range of silver and jewellery, were supplied by the Silver Studio which had offices in Brook Green, Hammersmith. Attributing individual designs to particular designers has been hampered by Liberty's policy of keeping their identity anonymous. Nonetheless, subsequent research over the years has identified the principal contributors. From the Silver Studio they included Rex Silver, the studio head after 1896, his brother Harry Silver, Harry Napper, John Illingworth Kay and most prominently of all, Archibald Knox (1864-1933), a gifted designer from the Isle of Man who started working for the Studio in 1898.\n\nManufacture\nManufacture of the Tudric range was undertaken by W.H. Haseler of Birmingham, a firm of manufacturing goldsmiths and jewellers who had formed a partnership with Liberty's in May 1901 to manufacture the Cymric range of silver and jewellery which Liberty had launched in 1899.",
