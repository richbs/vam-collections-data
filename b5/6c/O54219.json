            "physical_description": "Small circular table of walnut, on a triangular pillar and base, with three outset feet carved as Gothic buttresses, the frame with carved and applied Gothic ornament, the top of marquetry of ebony and sycamore, in the form of a rose window.\n\nThe triangular walnut base has extensions at each angle forming feet with, below their semi-hexagonal ends, small additions to raise the whole base above the ground. The edges of the base and extensions are chamfered. \n\nFrom the extensions rise curved, arched brackets with pendant, cusps, and, above, naturalistic carved oak leaf crockets. These brackets or buttresses butt against the plinth of the pedestal which is decorated on each side with a frieze of carved Gothic tracery, formed by interlocking arches and inverted arches. \n\nAbove this projects a cornice, supporting a second plinth filled by a frieze of carved diaper ornament with inset quatrefoils. The projecting ends are filled with aedicules and rise as curved buttresses to the pedestal, ornamented with carved oakleaves. The sides and ends of the triangular pedestal are panelled. \n\nThe ends support three curved brackets at the top, supporting the top which is inlaid in various woods around its edge in three simple bands and on its surface as a 'rose window' with elaborate Gothic tracery and foliate ornament.\n\nThe marquetry is made up of at least two different light coloured woods, ebony and a burr walnut ground.  There are three main concentric circles of decoration: a central hexagonal rosette, a double layer of interlocking heart and kidney-shaped petals with foliate crockets issuing within them and a scrolling foliate border.  Each concentric circle of motifs is bordered by a strip of striped stringing.  The same striped stringing also provides the outline for each of the petals.\n\nThe crockets in the petals and the scrolling foliate border are made up of many curved slivers of wood cut individually and fitted together very tightly.  The design of the marquetry is intricate but it has been beautifully executed so that the joins are not visible.  In fact the joins are so seamless that some areas such as the crockets and outer scrolling foliate border almost resemble the flame-like swirling pattern of the burr walnut ground.  There is no evidence of any staining, burning or engraving in the marquetry.\n\nThe stringing is also made up of very fine strips of wood.  At first glance it appears that these bands of stringing were formed from sheets of veneer stuck together, then cut into thin strips which were then bent and then stuck down to create the borders and outlines that we see on the table.  However, on closer inspection we can see that the length of some of the strips of wood varies within a single band.  This is for two reasons \u2013 firstly, the width of the band varies in places so that strips need to be adjusted accordingly to effect this; secondly, the length of the strips within a given band are varied in places to create shadow or contrast.  Therefore the width and make-up of each band of stringing, although it may appear the same throughout from afar, is in fact carefully tailored.  With this in mind it therefore seems unlikely that the bands of stringing are cut from ready-stuck sheets of veneer.  Rather it seems more likely that each strip was cut, bent and stuck individually to make up each band as required.",

            "public_access_description": "This small walnut table shows the very highest quality of workmanship, both in its carving and in the very fine marquetry of the top, the design of which is based on the rose window of a Gothic cathedral. When it was acquired in 1966 curators thought it was English, but research showed that it was very similar to tables made in the Coburg area of Germany in the middle of the 19th century. More recently, in 2002, a very similar table was on the London art market, which was stamped under the top with the name 'Renner in Coburg'.  We know nothing as yet about this cabinet-maker but he and his workshop clearly worked to the highest standards.",
