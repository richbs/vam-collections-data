            "physical_description": "An eight-sided wooden tea caddy of engraved mother of pearl and tortoiseshell with silver mounts, a hinged lid, two interior compartments with loose lids and four bun feet. \n\nThe surface decoration obscures from view the construction of the box.  However, we can see through losses in the decorative surfaces that the box is made of wood.  It is likely that the sides of the box are built up from the eight-sided base which has a chamfered edge veneered with tortoiseshell.  Four bun feet are either screwed or tenoned up into the underside of the base at each corner.  The exterior of the box is veneered with panels of engraved mother of pearl separated by very thin strips of silver stringing.  The keyhole escutcheon, hinges and a small eight-sided lozenge on the top of the lid are also in silver.  The underside of the box is covered with stamped black leather.  The top edges of the sides and the bottom edges of the lid are veneered with strips of ivory.  The interior of the box is divided into two equal compartments by a thin partition which runs from front to back and is held in place by four vertical glue blocks.  There are two further glue blocks at the outer side of each compartment and these, along with the partition blocks serve to support the lids for each compartment.    The lids are six-sided and veneered on top with tortoiseshell and lined underneath with foil.  Each has a small carved mother of pearl knob screwed or tenoned down into its top in the middle. The interior of the box is lined with silver foil.  The lid is lined with red velvet.\n\nThe two central mother of pearl panels on the front of the box are engraved with a waterside scene depicting a turreted castle on a bank in the distance on the left and a classical house set amongst trees on another bank in the foreground on the right.  There is a swan and two small rowing boats each with two people in them on the water near the house. There is a large sailing boat on the water in the far distance beyond the castle.  The rest of the panels (eight around the circumference of the box and nine on the lid) are engraved with flowers, foliage, vases and birds including peacocks.  The engraved decoration appears to have all been carried out by the same hand and is neatly executed, probably with a single fine-headed cutting tool.  The bottom of the box is covered with shiny black leather with stamped decoration consisting of a mottled ground with scrolling vines and leaves.",
