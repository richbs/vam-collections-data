The bodice was originally part of a high-waisted gown with a skirt attached at the waist beneath a narrow band of speckle-stitched self fabric.  The rounded drawstring neck is trimmed with a pinked and embroidered cutwork edging; the top of each sleeve has a small triangular panel of Ayrshire work showing a ring of six-petalled stylized flowers with sprays of foliage, which is trimmed with a pinked edging and was probably attached to a puffed sleeve.  The bodice front has a wedge-shaped panel of Ayrshire work showing sprays of stylized flowers and foliage; the bodice back is plain and gathered between the neck and waist, and the garment fastens at the neck and waist back with drawstrings.  The gown was altered ca.1860-70, when the neck was filled in with a row of gathered fabric, and a further row of partly gathered fabric, both edged with bands of speckle-stitched self fabric; a new neck drawstring and a Dorset wheel button with a stitched buttonhole were added as fastenings.  The triangular sleeve panels were retained, but the sleeves were replaced with tubular sleeves of gauged fabric which are either unfinished or lack their lower parts.",
