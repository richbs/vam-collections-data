True patina is created by chemical changes to the surface through long exposure to the elements. Artificial patina is created through the application of drying oils, resins, pigments or acids to protect the surface or to enhance or change the colour of the metal. Heat is sometimes used in this process. The surface can also be enriched by adding\ngold (\u2018gilding\u2019) or silver. This relief and inv. no. A.31-1959 are based on scenes painted by Raphael in the Vatican Loggia in about 1518. The frescoes were not easy to see but prints made after them served as models for work in a variety of media. The reliefs were originally attributed to the Florentine sculptor Massimiliano Soldani-Benzi (1658\u20131740). However it is now believed that they were made by Giuseppe Piamontini and only cast in Soldani\u2019s foundry.",
