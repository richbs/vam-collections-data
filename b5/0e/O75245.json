            "public_access_description": "By 1783 Mrs Siddons was the leading tragic actress in the country, and any portrait of her was guaranteed to be an eye-catcher in a crowded exhibition room. Richard Crosse astutely recognised the appeal of the star, and painted a miniature of five inches which he clearly intended to act as an advertisement for him as well as for the actress. Painting on such a large scale on ivory in watercolours was an undoubted test of skill. He has ingeniously exploited the light-reflecting ivory support by increasing the transparency of the watercolours by adding more gum arabic. He has also avoided depicting Mrs Siddons in a theatrical role. By presenting her in fashionable dress and standing among picturesquely evocative ruins, he alludes to her classical tragic roles, but does so with a gentle lyricism altogether appropriate to the scale of the art of painting in miniature.",
