Changing little since the 19th century, the sartorial requirements remain scarlet coats, top hats and breeches. Bernard Weatherill is one of the few remaining companies who still make hand-made bespoke breeches. The elegant riding boots are hand-worked by internationally renowned bootmaker, Schnieder. Bernard Weatherill added Olympic buttons to mark the fact that the company made the riding coats for Britain\u2019s equestrian teams at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta. This type of coat is worn only by the master of the hunt. Dressage top hats have largely been replaced by the more protective hunting cap. Patey (London) Ltd, the maker of the hat shown here, are one of the few companies using traditional methods to make exclusive top hats and riding caps.",
