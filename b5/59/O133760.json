Thomson was a successful, Scottish landscapist who was also minister for Duddingston from 1805. He was a close friend of the writer Sir Walter Scott (1771-1832), who was an important influence on his work, and collaborated with J.M.W. Turner (1775-1851) to produce illustrations for Scott\u2019s Provincial Antiquities and Picturesque Scenery of Scotland (1826).",

He may have painted it after 1831 as there is no evidence of a visit made by the artist to the Isle of Arran before that date.\n\nThomson painted many such sketches from nature of his native Scotland and was known to work quickly, often completing a sketch in a matter of hours. He was interested in the power of association with Scotland\u2019s literary and historic past, and his expressive, vigorous style evoked the mood of a landscape as opposed to its topographical features. His small sketches in particular, have been much praised in this regard. \n\nThomson was a successful, Scottish landscapist who was also minister of Duddingston from 1805. He was influenced by the Old Masters, including Claude Lorrain (c.1604-82), but also produced works of real originality, such as his small oil sketches. He was a close friend of Sir Walter Scott (1771-1832), who was another influence on his work, and collaborated with J.M.W. Turner (1775-1851) to produce illustrations, which were later engraved, for Scott\u2019s <i>Provincial Antiquities and Picturesque Scenery of Scotland </i>(1826).",
