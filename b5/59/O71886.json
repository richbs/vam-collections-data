Her right hand rests on the shoulder of the Virgin, who sits on a folding chair and holds the naked Christ Child in front of her. He reaches out to grasp the pages of the book. The group has been almost completely stripped of paint . Small traces of red pigment remain in the deep folds of St Anne's draperies.  The back of this statuette is only partly carved. This, together with its size, suggest that  this group would probably originally have been enclosed within a small altarpiece.\n\nThe style of the sculpture points to an origin in the area of North Brabant, around the lower Rhine. A comparable group now with the Child missing, may be found in the Sint-Servatiuskerk in Lieshout and it is likely that such sculptures represent an intermediary stage between the North Netherlandish products of the years around 1500 and the more accomplished sculptures of the workshops of Henrick Douwerman and Arnt van Tricht in and around Kalkar, most of which were carved in the years 1520-40.\nJudging by its size and the only partially blocked-out state of the reverse, this group would probably originally have been enclose within a small altarpiece.",
