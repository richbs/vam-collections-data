It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years. Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn\u2019t needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nHermione Baddeley trained as a dancer and made her stage debut in London at the age of twelve at the Court Theatre. She appeared in a wide range of stage, theatre and film roles, including the revue The Co-Optimists  at the Pavilion (1924), and the 1964 film Mary Poppins in which she played Ellen. She first appeared as Polaire when The Greeks Had a Word For It was produced at the Fulham Theatre in November 1933, and later at the Duke of York's Theatre in November 1934.",
