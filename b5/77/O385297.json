He studied at the Plymouth School of art between 1923 and 1927 and the Royal College of Art, London from 1927-1931. In the early 1930s the artist became exposed to the work of artists Picasso (1881-1973) and Klee (1879-1940). In 1936 he participated in the International Surrealist Exhibition, London, before moving away from the movement. The artist returned to his native Devon to teach at Dartington Hall from 1939 to 1943. He believed in art being created through visionary experience and spiritual quest and his works from the 1940s echo the mystical feel of the artists Samuel Palmer (1805-1881) and Odilon Redon (1840-1916). \n\nThis gouache drawing shows the crowned figure of a king in the left foreground looking out at the audience. He is shown from the waist upwards standing behind a curve in a hilly landscape. Depth is created through using primary colours within black outlines. The figure and landscape are typical of Collins' work from the mid 1940s.",
