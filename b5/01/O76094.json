            "physical_description": "This architectural component shows a warrior in high relief. It is much more imposing than an ordinary tile, although it would have been made in a kiln that specialized in tiles. It was once part of a freize, most probably on the front of a Buddhist temple. The body is stoneware and the use of a low-temperature lead glaze involved the piece being fired twice - the first high-temperature firing to fuse the body and the second, lower-temperature firing for the glaze. There are wide grooves on both sides of the piece, allowing a row of similar components to be joined together and secured into their current positions. Seen from a distance, the military figure would give the impression of being a sculpture rather than part of a building.\n\nOn the back of the unit is an inscription that reads: \"Zhending Prefecture, Jingjing County, Yi-an Community, Mashan Village, Fuchang Temple. Re-built Jiajing 27th year, 5th month, 18th day\". Jiajing 27th year is equivalent to 1548. Zhending Prefecture was in present-day Hebei province, which neighbours Shanxi province, where most tile-making kilns were located. That a small village temple could afford such an elaborate architectural frieze is an indication of the affluence of sixteenth century China. The inscription does not give the name of the warrior, but he probably represents Wei Tuo, one of the Buddhist deities, who is always portrayed wearing a suit of armour.",

During the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) tile production flourished. This fine example of the tilemaker's art, modelled with a standing figure in high relief, was designed for the main centre-piece on the roof ridge of a Buddhist temple. The architectural ornament has two large grooves on the sides of the plaque to secure it into position while the figure represents Wei Tuo, a Buddhist deity commonly depicted as a warrior. The inscription, situated on the back of the tile, would have been visible from the back of the temple, once the tile had been attached to the uppermost point of the roof. To fund such an ornate Buddhist ornament donations would have been received from the local monastic community.",
