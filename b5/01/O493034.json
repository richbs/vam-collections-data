            "public_access_description": "The netsuke is a toggle. Japanese men used netsuke to suspend various pouches and containers from their sashes by a silk cord. Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. Above all they had to have the means of attaching the cord. In this example, there are a pair of holes (himotoshi) on the bottom of the sandal. Although netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated is the katabori (shape carving). This is a three- dimensional carving, such as this netsuke. \nFrom the 18th century onwards, many more makers signed their netsukes. This example is signed Masateru from the Masanao regional group of Yamada, Ise  province. The line  originated with Masanao I (1815-90), although there were four other Masanaos, as well as various pupils who used the same 'masa' character in their name. Generations of Masanao craftsmen worked  almost exclusively in wood, especially  boxwood. They made detailed and realistic netsuke, such as this one. The Masanao line produced a wide range of  subjects, but they specialised in animals. Popular designs included a toad on a bucket, toad on a sandal and rats.",
