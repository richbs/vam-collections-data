Italian goldsmiths were expert at making a little material go a very long way.  Many pieces seem too large to wear comfortably, but they are usually made of very thin gold, and are much lighter than they appear.  Goldsmiths in the south of Italy used red gold most, unlike the yellow gold which was preferred in the north.  \n\nAll Italian women wore gold earrings.  Their shapes varied widely in different places.  This earring comes from Teramo, in the Abruzzi, a remote and mountainous area of central Italy.  It was formerly part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, and its traditional jewellery often has more in common with the south than with the rest of central and northern Italy.\n\nThis earring was bought as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
