            "public_access_description": "This poster was designed by design duo Michael English and Nigel Waymouth, known as Hapshash and the Coloured Coat. In the late 1960s they created psychedelic posters for many of the English bands of the time, and decorated and advertised Nigel Waymouth's King's Road boutique, Granny Takes a Trip. They also designed for concerts held at the UFO club and Saville Theatre, and for underground magazine Oz. Their influences came from the decorative and eroticised designs of Art Nouveau, combined with the melting rainbow colours of LSD visions and pop art inspirations from the post-war media; traces of Disney, horror movie monsters and comic book characters and can often be seen  hiding amongst the images.\n\nThe First International Pop Festival 1968 (1\u00ba festival internazionale in europa di musica pop 1968) was a Rock and Pop festival held in Rome to rival the USA's Monteray Pop, Miami Pop and Newport Pop festivals of 1968. This was arranged amidst campus occupation by students at the University of Rome and riots breaking out because students were stopped from marching on the US Embassy in protest of the Vietnam war. Performers included Captain Beefheart, Donovan, Julie Driscoll, Pink Floyd and on the third day, The Move, whom set fire to the stage with their pyrotechnics and were arrested by the police.  The festival had been scheduled to last a week, but after that performance the Palazzetto dello Sport was shut by the authorities and the festival was over.",
