This poster depicts Al-Abbas at the Battle of Karbala in 680AD. The battle was a significant defeat for the followers of Ali, who was the son in law of the prophet Muhammad and the father of Al-Abbas. During the battle, Al-Abbas, his brother Hussayn and their family were killed by a rival who wanted to lead the Muslim people. This poster depicts Al-Abbas collecting water for his family, shortly before he was killed by the rival army. Iranian Shi'ite Muslims still mourn those that died at Karbala, during the month of Muharrem. Special ceremonies are held and posters such as this one are displayed to remeber the events that led to their death.",
