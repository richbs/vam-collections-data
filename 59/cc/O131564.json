Apprenticed to a bookbinder, then worked as a portrait and miniature painter, encouraged by George Clint ARA, whom he met 1834. Joined the Clipstone Street Society 1839. Exhibited 45 works, mostly portraits, at the RA between 1834 and 1872, three at the BI 1846-49, and 154 at the SBA 1837-79, of which he was elected Member in 1842. Best known for his poetic and rustic subjects, and particularly his 'fancy' portraits based on the style of Sir Thomas Lawrence. Submitted paintings to the RA from Edinburgh in 1843 and 1845, and apparently visited Denmark around 1845. Died Lewisham, London, 10 January 1879. His studio sale was at Christie's 15 March 1879. There is no relation with the George Baxter of'Baxter Prints' fame. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i>1864, pp145-7, 1879, p73 (obit); <i>Illustrated London News</i>25 January 1879, p72 (obit with engr self-portrait)\n\n<b>The Sisters </b> \n548-1882 Neg 51453 \nCanvas, circular, diameter 32.4 cm (12 3/4 ins) \nJones Bequest 1882 \n\nEvidently a favourite subject, as Baxter painted it several times with variations, in both circular and rectangular format. Examples include those sold at Christie's 25 May 1889 (44, 52 X 42 Cm/20 1/2 X 16 1/2 ins), bought Polak \u00a326 5s, and 29 April 1911 (88, 54.6 X 43.2 cm/21 1/2 X 17 ins), bought Mitchell \u00a324 3s, A painting titled 'The Sisters' was shown at the SBA in 1865 (47). \tBaxter's inspiration may well have been works by Sir Thomas Lawrence such as his portrait of Emily and Laura Anne Calmady (exhibited at the RA1824, now Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York). Maas describes this kind of painting as 'hovering on the brink of genre painting ... merely a framed version of \"The Keepsake\" beauties'; he also links Baxter's work with that of E T Parris (see 57-1908 and 58-1908, p224). \n\nLIT: J Maas <i>Victorian Painters</i>1969, p 107, repr p111\"",
