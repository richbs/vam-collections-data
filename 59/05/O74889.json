            "public_access_description": "This miniature is by an amateur miniature painter, Sir Balthazar Gerbier, which explains its somewhat rough and awkward quality. Gerbier was born in the Netherlands, and while his education is unknown he clearly had training in the accomplishments required of a courtier, including the useful art of drawing. He entered the service of Prince William of Orange in 1615. Having been sent to England in an ambassadorial train in 1616, he transferred his service to the Earl (later the Duke) of Buckingham, an intimate friend of King James I, becoming his domestic architect and adviser on art. In the early 17th century in England some gentlemen became interested in miniature painting as a complement to their gentlemanly knowledge of heraldry, also painted in watercolour on vellum (fine animal skin). Heraldry enjoyed a special prominence under the early Stuart monarchs, and to the ambitious Gerbier a knowledge of miniature painting techniques must have seemed useful. He entered the service of King Charles I in 1628, just after Buckingham\u2019s assassination, and was knighted in 1638. This youthful portrait of the future Charles I shows him after he had been made Prince of Wales. Here the new heir to the throne is wearing the blue ribbon of the Order of the Garter. This miniature is a version of another portrait, rather than having been painted from life.",

I. no. 127 (identified by Williamson <i>Henry, Duke of Gloucester</i>); Piper 1963, p. 61 (dated c.1617-20); <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 24; Reynolds 1988, p. 37. \n \nIdentification as Prince Charles was by Long who dated the portrait on costume to c.1617, commenting that the 'description of the miniature as a portrait of Henry, Duke of Gloucester, who was born c.1639, is grotesque' (1).  Long, who had catalogued the Jones Collection, had in mind Cat. No.3, dated c.1616-17, and perhaps was thinking also of the portrait in the NPG which, when Long was working in 1935, had recently been correctly identified as a portrait of Charles rather than Prince Henry.  This picture, attributed by Piper (1963) to van Blijenberch, is thought to have been current c.1617-20, a view supported by the currency of similar images by Simon van de Passe for the <i>Baziliwlogia</i> from 1618 (2).  Long, Toynbee (3) and Piper would have concurred broadly on this sequence, which is consistent also with the account of Gerbier as beginning his career as limner only after entering the service of Buckingham. \n \nOn the other hand, an earlier van de Passe portrait of Charles, dated on the plate 1613, is closer to the Gerbier miniature, showing the Prince at the same age, with the same ruff-type and in the same sense.  It seems to suggest that this characteristic image of Charles as the heir, after his brother's death in November 1612, dates from the year when he had unexpectedly to grow into his brother's role.  With this dating, however, it ought to be consistent with the Hilliard image dated by Strong c.1613, (4) in which, however, the Prince seems much younger than in this version.  In all these portraits the Prince wears the ribbon of the Garter, so May 1611, the date of his investiture, provides a <i>terminus a quo</i>: perhaps therefore the Hilliard should be c.1611-12.  By the same reasoning, the unfinished Isaac Oliver type, dated by Strong 1615-16 (5) could follow the Hilliard at c.1612-13 (6) and be itself followed by the Windsor/NPG type (7) as Oliver's first image of the Prince as an adolescent in 1613.  The latter connects smoothly with this Gerbier/van de Passe type in face, hair and ruff, seeming certainly to endow the Prince with the gravitas appropriate to his new importance.  On the other hand, if a date of 1616 is preferred, it is possible to imagine that Gerbier, on his first arrival in England and without the privilege of a special sitting from the Prince, used a three-year-old van de Passe image as a source for this, his earliest essay in English limning, (8) and followed it rapidly by Cat. No. 3 [621-1882], which hails Charles as Prince of Wales. \n \nThe use of table-book leaf as a support for the vellum of this miniature is very exceptional in the practice of London miniaturists in the second decade of the century.  It occurs infrequently in the work of Peter Oliver at this time: see for example <i>Elizabeth of Bohemia,</i> (Cat. No. 11 [P.2-1917]) and the <i>Unknown Man</i> (Cat No. 9), both of which anticipate the <i>Kenelm Digby</i> of 1627, (9) which until recently was regarded as the earlier example of the use of gessoed card. (10)  The Gerbier, however, if it is 0f 1616 - let alone 1613 - beats anything so far known of Peter Oliver, and the probability that he, like Oliver, saw the potential of the material for miniature directly from its Continental, presumable Netherlandish, usage. \n \nGerbier's use of a table-book leaf for drawing is separately attested by Norgate's reference to him making a study of the Farnese <i>Hercules</i> 'with a silver pen [i.e., in silver-point] upon a large peece of Table-booke leafe'. (11)  Turquet de Mayerne's reference of c.1620 to grounded accounting tablets imported from Germany, (12) confirms the novelty in England of materials in common use on the Continent. \n \n1 MS note in department Register. \n2 Hind 1955, p. 133, no. 28, pl. 65 \n3 Toynbee 1949, pp. 4-9 \n4 V&A; see V&A 1983, no.249 \n5 V&A 1983, nos 260-1 \n6 Engravings showing the Prince at a similar age - still conspicuously boyish - were used for Robert Dallington, <i>Aphorismes Civill and Militarie</i> (1613) and for the 1613 edition of C van de Passe, <i>Regiae Angliae Maiestatis Pictura</i>. \n7 V&A 1947, no. 176, dated by Reynolds c.1610-15; Murdoch 1981, pls 94-5 and there dated c.1612. \n8 As he had in copying via the Bolswert engraving the 1613 Mierevelt portrait of Frederick V (of Bohemia), Mauritshuis; see Croft-Murray and Hulton 1960, vol.
