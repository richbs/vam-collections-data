Such huge glass versions could only have been made for grand dining tables.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe so-called baluster glass was invented around 1690. At this time the stylistic influence of the  Venetian glass-blowers employed by George Ravenscroft (1632-1681) was wearing off, and the refractive properties of heavy lead glass were more clearly understood. These enabled the production of crisp, plain profiles and elegant stems. Such features may be compared with contemporary metalwork.\n\nOwnership & Use\nThis type of goblet would have been passed around the table by the host. The practice persisted into the 18th century, particularly in places remote from fashionable London, such as Scotland. Eventually the unhygienic custom was replaced by the provision of individual drinking glasses, and the circulation of bottles and decanters with which to fill them.",
