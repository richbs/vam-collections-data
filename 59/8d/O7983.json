            "physical_description": "Table with rectangular top of slate, covered with <i>scagliola</i> showing a formal and symmetrical design centreing on a vase of Persian form containing a crown imperial with other flowers,  the corners filled with paired <i>cornucopiae</i>spilling lemons, pears, apples and turnips, with wheat ears and cherries, the pairs tied with red and white ribbon, the ground of the table also showing four birds. \n\nThe four legs, frame and stretcher of pine, oak and beech, covered in <i>scagliola</i>, the legs imitating Siena marble, the frame showing flowers in baskets and 16-point compass stars, the x-form stretcher with panels showing flowers against a black ground, the centre marked with a butterfly.\n[Table frame] <u>Design </u>\nThe frieze is decorated on both long sides with five compartments. The two small compartments, above each leg, are decorated with simulated marble, which picks up the thin band of simulated marble at the base of the frieze and the simulated marble of the columnar legs. The central compartment shows two birds pecking at strawberries. The two larger compartments flanking the central one are similar to the single compartments on the side friezes and show white flowering plants on either side of a star motif. The four columnar legs of the Doric order are covered with <i>scagliola</i> imitating orange marble, have giltwood capital and bases.  They are united at the base by a wavy, double-Y-shaped stretcher, which is decorated on the swelling centre section with a vase similar to that on the table top and on the arms wiht long-stemmed bell flowers and white flowers with five petals. Below the stretcher, the legs are raised on flattened, turned feet. \n\n<u>Construction</u>\nThe frame is mainly of pine, the turned legs possibly of beech, lime or sycamore. The long sides of the frieze are tenoned into the short sides and strengthened with large rectangular blocks glued into the angles, into which the legs are tenoned, through the abaci panels. The tops of the blocks are angled downwards from the back and front of the table and the short side rails are rebated on the inside at the top to the depth of this chamfer.  The reason for this is not clear. The <i>scagliola</i> is built up on the outside of the frieze panel to a depth of about 8 mm, the top of the <i>scagliola</i> protected by an applied facing of pine, approximately 8 mm high and the width of the rail at the top, painted black. The lower edge also shows a fillet, painted black, thinner than the upper one, above the thin, painted layer of imitation marble below the <i>scagliola</i>. These fillets are mitred at the outer corners.\n\nThe stretcher is built of five boards. The jointing is unclear.  There is no sign of lap-jointing on the sides of the elements.  The joints with the central panel are reinforced underneath with chamfered pine panels, nailed up. Additional S-shaped iron plates run under the wavy stretcher arms and under the shallow, square blocks in ebonized oak that are set between the columns and the feet. These plates are finely finished, with chamfered edges and are attached with screws which appear to be machine made. The <i>scagliola</i> on the top surface of the stretcher is approximately 7 mm thick and runs right to the edge.\n[Table top] The top is inlaid within a white outer stringing on the black ground.  Within this is a design of a vase of flowers in the centre with twin cornucopiae of fruit and flowers in each corner with six butterflies and four birds on a black ground. The  large central flower has been identified as a Fritillaria Imperialis. The cornucopiae are filled with  flowers, lemons, turnips, tomatoes, cherries and wheat ears. The left hand cornucopiae are identical in each corner, as are the right, although the former centre on melons and the latter on lemons. The scagliola is mounted on a slab of slate.",

This is a mixture of different-coloured pastes, which look like marbles when dried and polished. Italian workshops revived this ancient technique in the 16th century. The earliest known use in England was in 1669, when a monument to Lord Poulett in scagliola was erected in the St George's church, Hinton St. George, Somerset. This is attributed to Baldassare Artima, who also probably made our table. A small group of pieces of English furniture with similar scagliola decoration, made between about 1673 and 1686 seems to be the work of Baldassare Artima, possibly working with Diacinto Cawcy.\nA wealthy patron would have commissioned this table for display rather than practical use. It may have stood between the windows of a grand reception room, flanked by matching candlestands. This scagliola table retains most of its original bright colours, unlike marquetry tables of the same form made about 1670-1700.",

            "history_note": "This table came from Warwick Castle where it was recorded in the Green Drawing Room. It may have been acquired by Francis, 1st Earl of Warwick (1719-1773), for in 1757 Dr Richard Pococke recorded that 'there are some beautiful marble tables in the castle brought from Italy by the present Earl'. However, it is not mentioned in the 1815 description of the contents of the castle, and as Henry 3rd Earl of Warwick (1816-1853), bought a sixteenth century <font -i>pietra dura</font> Florentine table from the Grimani Palace in Venice, the <font -i>scagliola</font> table may have been acquired in the 19th century.\n\nThe table was sold by Christie's, King Street on 21 March 1968.\n\nIt was purchased from Mallett & Co in 1968. RP 68/3420\n\nHistorical significance: <font -i>Scagliola</font> was made in imitation of the costly <font -i>pietra dura</font> produced in the leading European Court workshops.\nExamples of scagliola have been found in classical Roman decoration but it was revived in 16th century Italy and developed there in the 17th century by the master mason Guido del Conte (1584-1649). There is evidence that scagliola was being imitated in Northern Europe by the 17th century. The earliest dated use of scagliola in England, ca.1673 -1675, is in the Queen's Closet at Ham House, Surrey, where black panels inlaid with naively rendered flowers and birds and green foliage ornament are used as a surround to the fireplace and the hearth stone is decorated with the Duke of Lauderdale's cypher and coronet. A set of candlestands, mirror frame and table incorporating the arms of the 2nd Earl of Peterborough, at Drayton House, Northamptonshire have, like the scagliola fire surround at Ham House have recently been attributed to Baldassare Artima, an Italian plasterer recorded as making a 'Chimney piece with a frame wrought out of stuccoe' for Whitehall Palace in 1686 (Wren Society, VII, p.116)\nThe design of this table top is much less sophisticated than contemporary Italian productions. Yet this table is the only example where the decorations of the top and the supporting structure are so closely integrated. Clearly it was the product of an important workshop, actively experimenting in the newly imported technique.",

            "production_note": "Possibly made in England, although it may have been acquired by Henry, 3rd Earl of Warwick (1816-1853) in Italy. If it was made in England in the late 17th century, it is probably the work of an Italian craftsman. The stretcher is very similar in form to that of a seventeenth century Flemish table in the V&A's collection (W.7-1965), suggesting that the table may have been constructed by a Flemish craftsman.",
