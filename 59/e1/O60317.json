It helped to establish his reputation as a leading designer and maker of furniture in the fashionable Art Nouveau style. Advocates of this new style looked to nature as the primary source of inspiration in design. \n\nThe form of the cabinet, which is not directly based on any historical precedent, shows Majorelle\u2019s inventiveness. The marquetry of human figures, trees and flowers demonstrates his enthusiasm for the natural world. Majorelle used marquetry to create large-scale pictorial panels, very different from the small-scale, formal patterns used by many cabinetmakers working in more traditional historical styles.",
