NB: there may be additional concealed wefts but the good condition of the carpet precludes further investigation.\n\nPILE: wool; 14 colours: dark red, red, dark yellow, yellow, olive green, dark green, green, green-blue, dark blue, blue , light blue, pink, light brown, white; asymmetrical knot open to the left and tied around 2 warp threads; 248 knots per sq. inch (4355 per sq. dm).\n\nSIDE FINISH one fine cord oversewn with dark blue wool.\n\nEND FINISH: lower 3 cms of plain weave with 5 loose shoots of 2 parallel white cotton wefts with the warps plaited right to left to make a final horizontal cord.  Towards the pile are 2 rows of weft wrapping in red/light green and in red/dark blue wool extending on the left to form a 7 cms. maximum plait.  Upper: 1.5 cms. of plain weave with 2 parallel white cotton wefts, the outermost thread twined to secure from 3 to 5 warp threads ending in a 5 cms. fringe.  Immediately below the fringe is a line of weft wrapping in red and dark yellow wool, and immediately above the pile in red and dark blue, both extending into a 10.5 cms. maximum plait at both sides.\n\nDESIGN: field - dark blue ground.  A brown tree rises from a shallow mound.  From its mirror-imaged branches grow a profusion of blossoms and small white flowers.  The boughs support a blue and dark yellow vase from which more branches and four elaborate blossoms grow.  At either side of the trunk stands a decorated blue vase holding mainly red and blue flowers. Beside the mound and the base of the vases grow four white-flowering plants. The spandrels and their half pendants either side of the domed head of the field have a dark green ground with a red and a blue blossom within a red foliate frame; stems with small flowers and leaves fill the rest of the spandrels.\n\nMain border: red ground with floral meander on a dark yellow stem, the larger blossoms are light blue or dark green and the smaller are blue.\n\nInner and outer borders: white ground with floral meander linking light blue flowers with red botehs.  In the centre of the upper outer border is a red inscription in a blue cartouche with the A.H. date 137 (0 or 5) and the words ...\n\nInnermost and outermost borders: a reciprocal 'Y' pattern in dark yellow and dark green is outlined in red.",
