He is represented in this exhibition by two paintings (see cat.no. 34).  This shows him as a topographer on a grand scale, a role usually undertaken in early years by artists, Turner for example, needing to make money through the publishing trade.  But, like Turner, De Wint had both an immense talent and affection for the art of topography, which demanded very special skills, and he produced such works throughout his maturity.  This is a magnificent example; most worthy of note, the meticulous rendering of the facade of the cathedral is not allowed to overpower the composition, introduced as it is by a vivid street scene.  The distinguished collector of watercolours Richard Ellison, who made one of the finest ever gifts and bequests to the V&A, and whose collection is well-represented in this exhibition, paid the highest recorded price for this work that the artist ever received - 105 - which was a great deal, considering De Wint's average annual income was around 500 (see also cat.no. 114).",
