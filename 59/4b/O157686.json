It was also the most often painted of all the ruins in Italy. Numerous mosaics of the scene were made, providing visitors with souvenirs to take home.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
