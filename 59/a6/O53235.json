It was designed to be easily moved around a table or grouped with other large chairs and a sofa.\n\nPlace\nThe chair comes from the Court Drawing Room at Goldsmiths' Hall, London. The room, which was intended for use by female guests, was originally decorated in a red, white and gold scheme. It had patterned crimson satin curtains and wall hangings bordered by gold and white mouldings. The seat furniture, which was covered with crimson silk damask, included three window seats, two sofas, four large armchairs and eight small chairs, as well as the fly chairs.\n\nMaterials & Making\nW. & C. Wilkinson, upholsterers and decorators, were chosen by the Goldsmiths' Company to supply the furniture. Their detailed specification of 1834 shows that initially the Company was offered alternative finishes for the furniture: carved rosewood with French polish, or painted and gilt beech, both with crimson damask upholstery. The slightly cheaper option of a painted and gilded finish was chosen. Wilkinsons provided scale drawings of the furniture designs, which were then approved by Philip Hardwick, the architect in charge of the project, and passed to the individual carver. The fly chairs were ready in 1835, at a cost of \u00a323 14s each.",
