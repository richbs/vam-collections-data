Although Alexandre Brongniart, the S\u00e8vres director, presented one at the Institut in 1800, S\u00e8vres window production only began seriously in 1823 to 1824. It ceased in 1848. Highpoints were windows for royal chapels at the Ch\u00e2teau d'Eu (1831), Dreux (1840 onwards) and Amboise (1842 onwards). Artists such as Ingres and Delacroix supplied designs, but these were executed by such minor figures as B\u00e9ranger, a porcelain painter.",
