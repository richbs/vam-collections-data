The chain consists of cast links, each shaped like a figure of eight with three granule rosettes, linked to each other by two rings of wire originally grooved to look like twisted wire but now worn smooth.  There are four rectangular plaques, each cast with a winged cherub\u2019s head between scrolls, which divide the chain into regular segments.  There are three loops at the end of each of the plaques, which match the chain links.  At each end of the chain there is a longer, matching rectangular plaque, each of which has half the clasp hinged to it.  The clasp has a slot fastening, which is so aligned as to form a 45 degree angle when closed.  The rectangular plaques and clasp are all gilded on the front.",

Although it is very similar in appearance to renaissance belts, it is more likely to be a later marriage belt.  The tradition of using expensive marriage belts of archaic design survived with women\u2019s traditional costume in many parts of the German-speaking regions of central Europe until the 19th century.\n\nThe use of a slot fastening is typical of traditional belts from this region, particularly those from Slovenia.  The design of the slot, at a 45 degree angle to the belt, suggests that this belt may originally have been longer, and intended to be worn on the hips, rather than round the waist.",
