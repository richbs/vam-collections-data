Studied at Cork School of Art 1822; moved to London 1827, entering RA Schools 1828 and won many prizes. Exhibited 84 works at the RA between 1829 and 1870, 20 at the BI 1832-44, and 21 (mostly watercolours) at the SBA 1830-71. Early subjects included portraits, later predominantly literary and historical. Elected ARA 1835, RA 1840. Visited Paris 1830, 1844, 1850, Brussels 1845, Italy 1855, Germany 1859. Executed vast wall paintings for the Palace of Westminster 1846-65. Friend of John Forster and Dickens. Contributed (as \u2018Alfred Croquis\u2019) caricatures to Erases's Magazine 1830-8; illustrated several books, including Dickens's Christmas books, Moore's Irish Melodies (1845), B\u00fcrger's Leonora (1847), Tennyson's Princess (1860). Declined to be proposed PRA 1866; supposedly refused a knighthood. Died Chelsea, London, 25 April 1870; his studio sale was at Christie's 24 June 1870. His portrait by E M Ward 1846 is in the NPG; there are letters to Forster in the National Art Library, and many drawings and watercolours in the V&A collections. \nLIT: \t\u2018Autobiography\u2019 (MS, RA Library: see E Kenealy in Dublin University Magazine XXIX, 1847, pp594-607); Athenaeum 30 April 1870, pp586-7 (obit); Art ]ournal 1870, pp 181-2 (obit); W J O'Driscoll A Memoir of Daniel Maclise RA 1872, p187; J Dafforne Pictures by Daniel Maclise 1871; R L Ormond \u2018Daniel Maclise\u2019 Burlington Magazine 1968, pp685-93; R L Ormond Daniel Maclise Arts Council National Portrait Gallery exhibition catalogue 1972 \n\nMacreadv as Werner \nF21 Neg 57089 \t \nCanvas, 174 X 100.3 cm (68\u00bd X 39\u00bd ins) \nForster Bequest 1876 \nPainted for John Forster in 1849 and 1850, and exhibited at the RA in 1851. Maclise painted it in exchange for \u2018Macbeth and the Weird Sisters\u2019, which he exhibited at the RA in 1836 and sold to Forster, but it was disliked by the sitter (again Macready) and eventually by the artist himself (see a letter from Maclise to Forster 1 August 1849, Forster MS 44); the present whereabouts of \u2018Macbeth\u2019 are unknown, but there is a drawing in the V&A collections \n(F88). \nMacready, like Forster, was a close friend of the artist. Two sittings are recorded in Macready's diary for December 1849, and the picture seems to have been finished by March 1850, see Forster MSS 54-9. The painting was exhibited first at Hogarth's print shop in 1850, and then toured England and Scotland, to attract subscriptions for an engraving: \u2018on the track of Macready to Edinburgh and Glasgow\u2019 Forster MS 56). Maclise intended to show it at the RA, and was urged by the artist Thomas Uwins to do so, but the tour delayed its exhibition there until 1851. In a letter to Forster in 1856, Lord Lytton recorded \u2018Ah, those memories of Lincoln's Inn Fields ... Macready glaring at you across the witch's cauldron ...\u2019 (quoted in Lady B Balfour Personal and Literary Letters of Robert First Earl of Lytton 2 vols, 1906); this presumably refers to the present work. See also p295 below. \nIn the RA catalogue, the title is given as \u2018Mr Macready, in the Character of Werner\u2019, and the following lines appended: \nWho would read in this form \nThe high soul of the son of a long line? \nWho, in this garb, the heir of princely lands?\nWho, in this sunken, sickly eye, the pride \nof rank and ancestry? In this worn cheek \nand famine-hollow'd brow, the Lord of halls\nwhich daily feast a thousand vassals? \n\nThe quotation is from the opening scene of Werner, a tragedy by Lord Byron in a Gothic-Romantic style, first published in 1822. It was one of Macready's most famous roles, first performed by him at Drury Lane in 1830. William Charles Macready (1793-1873) was the leading tragic actor of his day; for more details of his career, see the catalogue entry on his portrait by George Clint (D7 4). He gave a series of \u2018farewell\u2019 performances at the Haymarket Theatre in the late 1840s, each time acting Werner; his final appearance on the stage was in February 1851. The present picture may have been intended as a commemorative tribute. \nThe Art Journal critic commented: \nIt is a full-length portrait, but not of the usual life size; the features are like those of Mr Macready, characterised according to the spirit of the passage. There is but little colour in the work, and nowhere but in the hair is the artist's distinctive sharpness of touch recognisable; it is throughout painted with much force and freedom. \nThe portrait, which doubtless records Macready's appearance in the role on stage, owes much to Sir Thomas Lawrence's famous painting of \u2018John Philip Kemble as Hamlet\u2019 (1801, Tate Gallery), which introduced a powerful Romanticism to the image of the actor. Although Maclise's picture is a quarter of the size of Lawrence's the imposing image and deep chiaroscuro are similar. Ormond considers that it \u2018possesses a genuinely heroic grandeur, which raises it above the level of portraiture or illustrative genre to that of history painting\u2019. \n\nEXH: \tHogarth's print shop 1850; RA 1851 (644); International Exhibition 1871 (330, lent by Forster): Winter exhibition of old masters, etc., RA 1875 (267, lent by Forster): Charles Dickens V&A 1970 (G69); Daniel Maclise Arts Council, National Portrait Gallery 1972 (85); Royal Opera House Retrospective 1732-1982 RA 1982-3 (158) \n\nENGR: C W Sharpe 1852, pub I Hogarth \n\nLIT: \tThe Times 3 May 1851, p8; Art Journal 1851, p160; O'Driscoll, pp100, 106; ed W Toynbee Diaries of W C Macready II, 1912, pp441-2; Ormond 1972, p77 \n\nRonald Parkinson.\"\n<u>Vikutoria & Arub?to Bijutsukan-z? : eikoku romanshugi kaigaten = The Romantic tradition in British painting, 1800-1950 : masterpieces from the Victoria and Albert Museum / selected by Mark Evans</u> [Japan : Brain Trust], 2002. 185 p. : ill.
