The spandrels have a yellow ground and contain a flowering spray with exotic blossoms in red and blue and small green leaves.  The central field is off-white with isolated floral sprigs in off-set rows in blue, red and mauve. A line of squares form a column down either side surmounted by a lozenge and three ornamental rosettes.  The squares contain lozenges in red, blue and white or mauve, blue, yellow and red.  On the outside of the column is a panel containing a lobed arch with a red cypress tree on a rocky mound and floral details on a cream ground.  This leads into a white border which goes over the top of the central panel and contains delicate floral meandering stems.  This border encloses a small red rectangle with a cartouche and floral motifs.\nAcross the bottom is a series of bands:\nThere is a floral meander on a yellow ground and a wider band containing a lobed lozenge with either a white or yellow ground and flowering spray, alternating with an oblong containing a cusped arch and cypress tree or boteh.  The rest of the ground is densely covered with flowers. Both cypress and boteh filled oblongs continue around the central panel, meeting in the upper centre at a wider oblong containing floral spray.  There are narrow red and white borders around the sides. \nThe decoration down the sides comes from a rocky mound and cypress tree and forms a column with a fine floral lattice on a white ground terminating in a line of geometrical shapes, mainly oval. Across the top is a band of architectural cypress tee shaped domes and leafy spikes.  There is a narrow plain red band top and bottom and partway down the sides.\nBoth selvedges are present.\nColours: 2 reds, 2 blues, mauve, yellow and green.",
