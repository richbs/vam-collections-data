The relevant text is as follows: <i>style of</i> SOLIMENA, FRANCESCO 1183 The Virgin and Child, accompanied by angels, appearing to St Benedict: a design for an arched altar-piece Pen and ink and wash; squared in red chalk 18 5/8 x 11 5/8 (472 x 296) CAI. 401 PROVENANCE Ionides Beques 1901 (Lugt 488) LITERATURE <i>Ionides Catalogue</i>, p. 17 (as anonymous) The style is reminiscent of Solimena, particulary in the use of voluminous draperies and deep, emphatically defined folds. The drawing may be connected with Solimen\u2019s work at Monte Cassino, the centre of the cult of St Benedict, destroyed in the last war. St Benedict is identifiable through the crow holding a white object, presumably a piece of bread, in its beak. According to legend th saint was saved from death by poisoning through a crow which carried off the noxious food.",
