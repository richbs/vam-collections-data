Tobacco smoking was introduced into the empire from the Deccan sultanates to the south in 1604. The emperor Akbar (r. 1556-1605) had sent an emissary, Asad Beg, to Bijapur who wrote of his visit: 'In Bijapur I found some tobacco. Never having seen the like in India, I brought some with me and prepared a handsome pipe of jewelled work' which he presented to Akbar. He reported that merchants began to sell tobacco, so the habit of smoking quickly spread. Akbar's son, Jahangir, banned smoking in his presence.",
