It was the standard tomb for Pharaohs and the social elite. But also later when the Pyramids were built, they remained built as simpler versions for the tombs.\nThe word mastaba comes from Arabic and means bench.\nThe mastaba's shape was rectangular with a flat roof and it had sloping sides. Below the whole over ground structure, was the underground chamber, for the remains of the deceased. The over ground building also contained a chapel, used by priests and family to bring their offerings.",
