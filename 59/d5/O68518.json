They are used to transport possessions on pack animals when the community travels and are used for storage and decoration, and as something comfortable to lean against, when the community settles for a while and erects tents.  The two sides of a bag, back and front, are called 'faces' and the one at the front is often decorated with knotted pile or with a woven design. The blocks of colour at the top of this bag face are tapestry-woven, a technique which creates a slit between each colour . A stout cord would have been threaded through these slits to close and secure the bag.",
