Although this photograph has no information written on it, it is one of a group of three taken at the same time, one of which is inscribed with a name and address in Steglitz, Berlin, that may indicate that this was taken by a photographer called Irene Aton, and that it was taken in the same area.\n\nKasperl, or Kasperle in southern Germany and Austria, is the hero of German puppet theatre whose roots like those of his British cousin Mr Punch date back to the 17th century Italian commedia dell\u2019arte. The puppet character actually named Kasper first appeared in Munich in 1858 in the marionette play The Enchanted Lily by Franz Graf Pocci (1807-1876). Like his cousin Punch, the early Kasper used a slapstick to beat the Devil, Witch, and Crocodile.",
