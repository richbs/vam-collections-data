The rail (8mm thick) has shaped ends and is pierced with two semi-circles flanking a central \u2018keyhole\u2019 shape. \n\nConstruction \nThe stool originally consisted of five (one rail missng) oak boards varying in thickness. Both inward-sloping side pieces (18-20mm thick) with shaped edges that are chamfered on the inside, fit into a shallow rebate in the underside the seat board, and are cut with two deep slots to receive the front and back rails. The seat board (18-20mm thick) has a moulded edge all round, and is held with 6 dowels onto the side-pieces, effectively holding all the elements of the stool in place.",
