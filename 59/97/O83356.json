The same shape occurs on two coffee pots made at the Bow porcelain factory in East London in the 1760s. One of these was sold at a London auction a few years before this piece was made, and the other is now in the V&A. The design of this earthenware piece was possibly taken from the first of these Bow pots. Alternatively, both this Italian earthenware pot and the Bow porcelain ones may have been copied from the same prototype, possibly an Italian porcelain or silver coffee pot, or one made in pottery in Northern France.",
