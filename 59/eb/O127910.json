Member of 'The Clique' in the 1840s; elected ARA 1845, RA 1852. Died Sr John's Wood, London, 2 November 1909; there had been a studio sale at Christie's 14 June 1884. The <i>Art Journal</i> obituarist wrote: 'the artist will be missed: he was an institution'. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1856, pp237-40 (for other references to Frith in the <i>Art Union</i> and <i>Art Journal</i>, see the entry in C Wood <i>Dictionary of Victorian Painters</i> 1971); W P Frith <i>My Autobiography and Reminiscences</i> 3 vols 1887-8; <i>Times</i> 4 November 1909 (obit); <i>Art Journal</i>191O, p14 (obit); Mrs J Panton <i>Leaves from a Life</i> 1909, <i>More Leaves from a Life</i> 1911; W P <i>Frith</i> Whitechapel Art Gallery exhibition catalogue 1951; N Wallis <i>A Victorian Canvas</i> 1957; J Mass <i>Gambart: Prince of the Victorian art world</i> 1975; A Noakes <i>William Frith: Extraordinary Victorian Painter</i> 1978. \n\n<b>An English Merry-Making, a Hundred Years Ago</b> \n510-1882 Neg H306 \nCanvas, 24.1 x 40.6 cm (9\u00bd x 16 ins) \nJones Bequest 1882 \n\nPresumably a preliminary sketch for the large (113 x 185.4 cm/44\u00bd x 73 ins) picture begun in 1846, exhibited at the RA in 1847, and now in the Proby collection at Elton Hall near Peterborough. In the RA catalogue, the title was followed by a quotation from Milton's 1632 poem <i>L'Allegro</i>:\n \nWhen merry bells ring round, \nAnd the jocund rebecks sound, \nTo many a youth, and many a maid, \nDancing in the checquered shade; \nAnd young and old come forth to play \nOn a sunshine holiday. \n\nFrith seems to have paid especial attention to this painting in order to justify his election to ARA in 1845 (see 538-1882, pl05). \n\nFrith describes his work on the RA picture in his <i>Autobiography</i>: \n\nI put no trust in fancy for the smallest detail of the picture. The oak-tree is a portrait of a patriarch of Windsor Forest, whom I recognised the other day unchanged in the slightest degree; could the tree have seen me, I am sure he would not have known me again. . . The cottages are studies from nature, and every figure in the picture is more or less a portrait of the model who sat for it. The old woman sitting at the tea-table by the cottage-door was a Mrs King, who followed the respectable calling of a washerwoman ... I used my wife's sisters and some friends rather remorselessly, but, I think, with good effect. \n\nHowever, he continues: 'The bits of distance and the grass and sky bothered me terribly. Creswick, who had become my intimate friend - and who was good-nature personified - offered to mend the distance for me, and the result of his doing so was very satisfactory'. Frith also records that the painting was 'hung in one of the angles of the middle room at Trafalgar Square, and was very successful. Previous to its going to the Exhibition, it was sold to a picture-dealer for three hundred and fifty pounds; since then it has changed hands many times, and is now an heirloom in a large collection in the north' (presumably the Bolckow collection - see <i>Versions</i>: below). \n\nThe painting was indeed successful. Frith records that J M W Turner admired it. The <i>Art Union</i> critic thought 'We have never seen anything in genuineness of feeling so especially realize the descriptions given by our poets of an English holiday of this period ... not only the best which this artist has painted, but worthy of being cited among valuable examples of the English school'. The <i>Athenaeum</i> agreed: 'One of the most complete and successful pictures of the season ... the colour is rich and brilliant ... there is a great improvement in the mode of painting over Mr Frith's previous works'. \n\nAs was his habit with successful compositions, Frith made other versions at various times (see <i>Versions</i>: below). \n\nENGR: (RA picture) William Holl Jr 1852 \n\nLIT: (RA picture) <i>Athenaeum</i> 29 May 1847, p576; <i>Art Union</i> 1847, p191; <i>Autobiography</i> I, pp 122-7; T Borenius and J Hodgson <i>Catalogue of the Pictures at Elton Hall</i> 1925, repr facing p104 \n\n<i>Versions</i>: 1 Exh RA 1847 (251), sold to a dealer; owned by John Nagler in 1852, according to lettering on Holl's print; exh <i>Art-Treasures Exhibition</i> Manchester 1857 (320, lent by John Naylor): exh <i>International Exhibition</i> 1862 (662, lent by J Graham); exh <i>Royal Jubilee Exhibition</i> Manchester 1887 (334, lent by Mrs Bolckow): Christie's (partly W W F Bolckow collection) 18 June 1892 (159) 110.5 x 183 cm, (43\u00bd x 72 ins) bought Lord \u00a3451 10s; Proby collection, Elton Hall, nr Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, 113 x 185.4 cm (44\u00bd x 73 ins), signed and dated 'W P Frith 1847' \n\n2 Canvas, 52 x 85.1 cm (20\u00bd x 33\u00bd ins), signed and dated 1887, in collection of artist's great-grandson in 1951 \n\n3 Canvas, 52 x 87.5 cm (20\u00bd x 33\u00be ins), signed, said to have been painted in 1889, exh Whitechapel Art Gallery 1951 (13, lent by Josiah Rhodes) \n\n4 Christie's 7 December 1962 (20), 52 x 85.1 cm (20\u00bd x 33\u00bd ins), signed, property of Miss Kathleen M Kay, repr in catalogue \n\n5 Waiter Frith (in 'A Talk with my Father', <i>Cornhill Magazine</i> 119, May 1906, p597) describes him at the time of writing as having just finished another version \n\n6 Sold Gemmell, Tuckett and Co, Melbourne, Australia 23 May 1902; private collection, Australia, 86.4 x 141 cm (34 x 55 ? ins), not inscribed\"",
