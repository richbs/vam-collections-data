Biscuits are pieces that have been given high-temperature firing when not glazed; they can then be decorated with glazes at a moderate temperature. Some beautiful examples of Ming pottery are biscuit wares decorated, as is this vase, using the fahua technique, whereby coloured glazes are applied within areas enclosed by thin lines or ridges of raised slip. Fahua has been compared with cloisonn\u00e9 metalwork (enamel set within metal-banded compartments). It may be that the potters adopted the use of raised clay partitions around motifs in order to inhibit the running of liquid glaze from one area to another.\n\nFahua pieces made in southern kilns had subtle differences compared to their northern counterparts. Pieces made in the north, in kilns situated within Shanxi province, were low-fired stonewares with additional white slip applied to their bodies. Those made in the south, probably at Jingdezhen, were high-fired porcelains with white bodies",
