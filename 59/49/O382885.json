Sk\u00e5ne province, in the extreme south of Sweden, has the richest tradition, and more jewellery was worn there than in any other district.   Almost all the Swedish traditional jewellery at the V&A comes from Sk\u00e5ne.  \n\nA well-dressed woman from Sk\u00e5ne wore multiple pairs of silver clasps along the front edges of her outer clothes.  Some of these were functional, and hooked into each other.  Others were purely ornamental.  This clasp is based on a bodice clasp, and still has a tiny matching hook and eye to fasten it, but it is far too weak to function properly as a clasp, and would have been worn simply as a decorative appliqu\u00e9.  It has the marks of Petter Lorentzson Gadd, a silversmith who worked in Kristianstad from 1751 to 1764.  This kind of jewellery made from stamped sheet silver is typical of Kristianstad, which was one of the main centres for traditional jewellery in Sk\u00e5ne in the 18th and 19th centuries.",
