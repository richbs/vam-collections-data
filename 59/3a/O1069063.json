R. Redgrave, in his book entitled 'David Cox and Peter De Wint', (1891), states that this drawing represents Ockley Green, with Leith Hill in the distance.  Walter Shaw Sparrow, in the Summer issue of the 'Studio' magazine of 1903, says that De Wint, finding that he could not sell this drawing, strained another piece of paper over its surface to save the outlay on a new stretcher.\nAfter his death, when perparations were being made for the sale at Christie's, the hidden watercolour was discovered by a Mr Vokins.  The drawing is perhaps that exhibited as 'A Cricket Match' at the Old Water Colour Society in 1815.",
