It is a simple spiral race game, starting at The Grave of Venus and finishing at The Altar. Several of the playing spaces are illustrated. Some of these give directions for further movement, either forwards or backwards. The illustrations are all to do with the progress of a courtship leading \u2013 or not, as the case may be \u2013 to marriage. Examples of play include Salute leading to Smiles for forward movement, and Unworthiness leading to Rejection for backward.",
