The cape falls from a semicircular yoke, and is trimmed with a band of  lace insertion (to match that on the coat and cap) between rows of horizontal tucking, to finish with a deep flounce of machine-made lace to match that on the coat.  The cape fastens to the coat at the neck back with a stitched buttonhole.\n3. matching cap, made up of alternating bands of tucked silk and machine-made lace insertion (matching that on the coat and cape), pleated into a circular crown.",
