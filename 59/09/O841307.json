Vivares Sculp.\nVAM (E.731-1907)\n\nA fantastic structure composed of scrolls and columns, set in a wooded landscape. It bears two chinamen, a female figure, a dragon, the title and the arms of Lord Middlesex. De la Cour\u2019s First Book (title and 6 plates by Vivares) was succeeded by the Second Book, 1742, dedicated to the Earl of Holderness (title and 5 plates by Vivares); the Third Book, 1743, dedicated to the Duke of Rutland (title and 6 plates by De la Cour); the Fourth Book, 1743, (title and 6 plates by De la Cour, Charles Mosley and R. White); the Fifth Book, Useful for all manner of Furniture and all other things, 1743 (title and 14 plates by R. White); the Sixth Book, undated, (title and (?) 7 plates by De la Cour); the Seventh Book, 1745 (title and (?) 6 plate, one by De la Cour); the Eight Book, 1747 (title and 6 plates by Jacob Bonneau). The only complete set, in which the fifth and sixth books are confused, is at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum (1962-126-1(1-56)). The three noble dedicatees were all keen supporters of the Opera, for which De la Cour painted scenery.\n\nLit: Berlin 1939, 261; Croft-Murray 1970, p.199; Ward-Jackson 1958, p. 34, No. 346\nMS\"\n",
