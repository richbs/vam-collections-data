From the turn of the century he travelled around Europe, living in Berlin, Brussels, Paris and Jersey. With his eye for detail, timing and geometry, he accurately captured the leisure activities, sports and customs of the period. Besides their documentary value, his photographs have a quirky and almost surreal quality. \n\nIn the town of Pontina in southern Italy, Pitcairn-Knowles photographed each stage of the fishing process, from laying out the nets to frying the fish. He liked to photograph close-up. The proximity of the camera to its subject results in a striking image of a hardworking hand covered with whitebait.",
