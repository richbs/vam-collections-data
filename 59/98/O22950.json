This design was made for a 'Daily Telegraph' series on modern interiors in the rooms of an old house. Clendinning has created a completely new shell within the old walls, simplifying forms and giving them curved outlines which not only recall the shapes of the 1930s but also the Smithsons' 'House of the Future'. Moveable seating has been reduced by creating a sunken area or 'conversation well' in the main room, which is dominated by a pyramid of carpet-covered boxes which is both a table and a stand for the television and record player. The other furniture includes foam cushions and the designer's own 'Meniscus' chairs. Adron's drawing technique, which was highly influential, manages to combine indications of the ceiling and ground plan with a view of the room.\n[Michael Snodin, 'British Design at Home', p.150]",
