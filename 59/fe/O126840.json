In this picture we have a faithful transcript of a momentary scene in a farmer's yard; the time evening. The team is just returned with a waggon, and the driver is preparing to water them, whilst a group of gossips have met to have a little chat, ere they retire to their homely cots. The scenery is picturesque and natural, the trees are well designed, and painted with a firmness of touch which distinguishes the works of Mr. Chalon.\"\nLambourne, L., <u>The Chalon brothers: landscape, the theatre and caricature in the work of Alfred-Edourd Chalon (1781-1860) and Jean-Jacques Chalon (1778-1845)</u>, London, 1981, p.1.\nThe painting, exhibited at the Royal Academy, was \"praised for its 'picturesque and natural sceneray' and 'firmness of touch'\".",

Bought by Farrer for the South Kensington Museum for \u00a338-17-0.\n\nThe painting was exhibited under the title of <i>Village Gossips- A Scene from Nature</i> at the Royal Academy in 1815. I\n\nHistorical significance: John James Chalon (1778-1851) was born in Geneva, Switzerland. He moved to England with his family when his father became professor of French language at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst in 1789. J.J. Chalon entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1796, his younger brother Alfred Edward Chalon (1780-1860) following him in 1797. J.J Chalon exhibited paintings at the Royal Academy between 1801 and 1854. Chalon also designed and produced a series of lithographs titled A Set of Twenty-Four Subjects Exhibiting the Costumes of Paris and co-founded the Society for the Study of Epic and Pastoral Design with his brother and Francis Stevens in 1808. \n\nVillage Gossips was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1815. A large tree rises up in the centre of the painting, its branches spreading out over the scene below. In the middle distance a group of three horses stand underneath the tree by a pond waiting to be watered. The scene continues behind them with a street lined with wooden framed houses leading in to the distance. The tones of dark browns and greens convey a feeling of the dwindling light in the early evening. This palette is typical of Chalon\u2019s early work. Although the tree and its surroundings are the main focal point of the painting, it actually takes its name from the group of three women in the bottom right hand corner, who have stopped to talk. The outstretched left arm of the figure with her back to us points at the distant group of horses. This effectively directs our eye into the scene underneath the prominent tree in the composition. \n\nThe genre of rural landscapes such as <i>Village Gossips</i> was enjoying popularity at the turn of the nineteenth century. The painting was reviewed in the Akermann\u2019s Repository in 1815. In this review the critic explained that the popularity of this subject reflected the interest that people living in cities found in the \u201cRepresentation of the manners and habits of the peasantry\u201d.",
