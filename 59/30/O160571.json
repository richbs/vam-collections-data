            "public_access_description": "Elaborate centrepieces were a feature of eighteenth-century fine dining tables. They would be accompanied by equally colourful and elaborate tureens, sauceboats and salts. Figural features are often found on earthenware and porcelain dining items and themes of Greek and Roman gods and goddesses were very popular. The tin-glazed earthenware (\u2018fayence\u2019) centrepiece here has a figure of Triton forming the stand for a dish which probably held sweetmeats or possibly fruits. Triton was the son of Poseidon, god of the sea and his consort Amphritite. Triton is usually depicted as a merman, half man and half fish.\n\nThis Triton centrepiece was produced at the fayence factory in Hol\u00edc. Hol\u00edc, or \u2018Holitsch\u2019 in Hungarian, was formerly part of the Hungarian Empire. It is now in Slovakia, independent from Czechoslovakia since 1993. Hol\u00edc is a town on the western border of the country and has a pottery-making tradition dating back to at least the 17th century. In 1743 a fayence, tin glazed earthenware, factory was established under the patronage of Francis I, consort of the Hapsburg Empress Maria Theresa.  \n\nWith their bold, swirling forms and bright colouring, many of the fayence products of the Hol\u00edc factory bear a strong similarity to Strasbourg fayence, particularly to those of the Paul Hannong workshop. Strasbourg was part of the Duchy of Lorraine, Francis\u2019 ancestral lands. Although Francis relinquished his right to the Duchy upon his marriage to the empress, he still retained contact with his ancestral lands and it is likely that he encouraged workers from Strasbourg to assist in the establishment of his fayence works in Hol\u00edc.",

It was purchased from the Aigoin Collection.\nSubsequently, it was reattributed as 'Hungarian (Holitsch), middle 18th century'.\n\nIn May 1984 Dr. Jana Kybalov\u00e1 of the Decorative Arts Museum in Prague said it was Holitsch like the one in Brno in the Kunstgewerbemuseum. It bears a 'HF' mark in blue.\nThere are other examples in the decorative arts museum in Budapest and in the castle in Cerven\u00e1 Lhota.\n\nA Triton centrepiece sold at Christie's London, King Street (2 November 1998) which bears a black 'HH' mark and is dated to about 1770. \nAnother Triton centrepiece sold at Christie's Amsterdam (14-15 December 2004). That one bore a mark 'Hf' in blue and was dated to about 1760.\n\nThe Hol\u00edc (Holitsch in Hungarian) factory was founded under the patronage of Francis of Lorraine, consort of Empress Maria Theresa. Fayence production started in 1743 on a small scale. Production began to increase dramatically from about 1750. Some of the Hol\u00edc fayence pieces, such as this Triton centrepiece, bear a strong resemblance to Strasbourg fayence and may be due to that workshop being part of the lands of Francis. \n\nThe products were commonly marked with a 'H' (for 'Holitsch') and 'HF' in blue (for 'Holitscher Fabrik') and 'HH' in black (for 'Holitscher Herrschaft').",
