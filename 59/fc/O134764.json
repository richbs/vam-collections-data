While many were of plain muslin or whitework embroidery, lace was worn by those who could afford it. The design, overall shape and number of ruffles (for women, one, two or even three layers) changed with fashion during the course of the century. This pair is typical of the mid-century, with a symmetrical design starting from a wide centre, tapering towards the ends. The quality of the lace is indicated by the variation in individual flower motifs, and the number of different filling stitches used.\n\nThe very fine, soft, thread used for Mechlin lace made it particularly suitable for accessories like sleeve ruffles where it was required to drape and fall loosely in delicate folds.",
