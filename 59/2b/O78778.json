In an age when fixed upholstery did not exist, they made hard wooden seats more comfortable, as well as adding decoration and colour. Chairs were then unusual, but the cushions could be used on wooden stools and benches, on window seats and chapel stalls. They might be made of  tapestry or other woven fabrics, or embroidered canvas, silk or velvet.  Many  embroidered cushions survive in historic houses and are therefore more  familiar, but a small number of tapestry cushions are also known.\n\nPeople\nConspicuous display of social and economic standing, once the privilege only of the aristocracy, was an important result of the increasing wealth of Elizabethan society. More and more people could afford luxury items which could be displayed inside their house, and some made use of  coats of arms, names or initials  on the fabric of the building itself. This cushion cover is modest and relatively simple in style. It shows the arms of a once influential provincial family, although it is not entirely certain which of them was the cushion\u2019s first owner. There were several men in different branches of the family called Henry  Sacheverell \u2013 represented by the H and S \u2013 to whom this cushion, and its twin in the Burrell Collection in Glasgow, might have belonged.",
