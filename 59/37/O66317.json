Bay  (a corruption of 'Baby', the name by which she was known to her family in which she was the only girl) trained at the Tree Academy as an opera singer and appeared in performances at Covent Garden and at Her Majesty's Theatre. She had the opportunity of continuing her singing studies at La Scala, but her family felt she was too young, and after a bout of TB affected her voice she abandoned grand opera for the variety stage, appearing with concert groups including The Seven Romps in1912 and then in various double acts with other girls including The Trilbies with Eileen Lawler in 1913, touring the Near East and Asia as well as Britain, and with Evelyn Kirkby as Kirkby & Harrington.  She appeared in pantomime in London and the regions as well as in variety.",

It would have been worn in the finale 'walk down' when the principals take their individual calls.\n\nHistorical significance: The costume is for an aristocratic Principal Boy (such as the Prince in Cinderella) of the post 1915-early 1920s.   It shows the transitional stage between the heavily boned, stylized costumes of the late 19th century, of which the Museum possesses a superb example in S.1351/B-1984, and the 18th century-based style which became traditional for princely principal boys in the 1930s.",
