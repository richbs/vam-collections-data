Irving designed the sets for George Bernard Shaw's play Pygmalion when it was staged at the St James's Theatre in 1953. He painted his picture of a rehearsal in 1972, working from sketches made at the time. The play was directed by the actor-manager John Clements, who also played Professor Henry Higgins. His wife, Kay Hammond, was Eliza Doolittle.  \n\nThe painting shows stage hands setting the scenery for Professor Higgins's sitting room. Irving painted himself in the picture: he is the figure in painter's overalls standing in the stalls. John Clements is sitting in the front row; his assistant, taking notes, is on his left. At the front of the stage, shielding his eyes from the lights, is stage manager Harry Fine. In the right hand corner is the theatre cleaner who, according to the artist, vacuumed the carpet regardless of rehearsals.",
