Adopting processes previously used in advertising \u2013 the dye transfer technique was predominantly commercial at the time \u2013 Eggleston set a precedent for colour documentary and art photography that remains influential today. His work pinpoints the moment when colour began to be generally accepted as part of the language of art photography, and his subtle choices of camera positions loosened up photographers\u2019 ideas about viewpoint. \n\nIn the early 1970s Eggleston began to photograph the realities of his own landscape in the American South. He finds \u2018the uncommonness of the commonplace\u2019 in ordinary scenes and places, as photographer Raymond Moore described it. Inspired by family snapshots, he focuses on the everyday and the overlooked in order to reveal them as remarkable.",
