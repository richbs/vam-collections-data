Originally intended as expressions of dynastic power and to celebrate political allegiances, allegorical themes had been introduced into these table settings by the 16th century. By the 18th century many were entirely decorative. Meissen in Germany was the first factory to make porcelain figures for the dessert. It set the sculptural conventions followed by porcelain factories elsewhere.\n\nThe presence of the lion and the cornucopia of fruit suggests that this figure of a standing white woman may represent \u2018Africa\u2019. The convention for depicting the Four Continents as female figures was used as early as the Counter-Reformation to symbolise the worldwide spread of Catholic Christendom and was later given wider appeal through inclusion in the Iconologia of Cesare Ripa, an illustrated book of emblems widely used by artists from the early 17th century. However, \u2018Africa\u2019 was usually depicted as a black woman. Sets of figures such as these were produced in quantity at the Bow factory.",
