Black basalt is a hard black vitreous stoneware, named after the volcanic rock basalt. The colour of black basalt came from 'Carr', an oxide of iron suspended in water that flowed through coal seams and mines. It was manufactured by Josiah Wedgwood from about 1768 and other manufacturers soon followed. Black basalt does not need to be glazed and can just be polished to a dull sheen. The use of the engine-turning lathe was first introduced into the  Staffordshire pottery industry by Josiah Wedgwood I in 1763 and quickly adopted by other potteries.  This coffee pot displays a bold design, the combination of high sheen accentuating the striated cutting.",
