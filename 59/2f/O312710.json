He was born in Gambassi (according to Baldinucci). In 1632 he apparently became blind and therefore was known as 'Cieco da Gambassi'. There is some doubt as to the extent of his disability, since in 1637 he followed a course at the Florence Academy, and he later made portrait busts of the Grand-Duke Ferdinand II and Pope Urban VIII.",
