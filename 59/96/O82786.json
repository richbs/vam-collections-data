London: Tate Gallery, 1980, p. 82-83, cat. no. 65\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"<b>65  Joshua Kirby</b> (1716-74) \n       Canvas, 41.9 x 29.2 (16\u00bd x 11\u00bd)  \n       About 1757-8 \n       Lit: Waterhouse, No. 418 \n       <i>Victoria and Albert Museum</i>   \n \nJoshua Kirby, son of the author of <i>The Suffolk Traveller</i>, a house and coach painter who edited Brook Taylor's treatise on perspective, was, though quite the opposite in character - pious and earnest- one of Gainsborough's closest friends, and is supposed to have been responsible for bringing him before the notice of George III, with whom he was intimate. Gainsborough particularly requested that he should be buried near his friend's grave in Kew churchyard. The head of Gainsborough's purposeful friend is given added strength through the force of lighting, and the coat is left unfinished as in his own self-portrait (Cat.no.59). The picture was probably a gift, and remained in the family until the mid-nineteenth century.\"",
