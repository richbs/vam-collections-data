She is bareheaded, although the top of her head is cut back to take a crown. The Chirst Child stands between them in a long robe.  The detailed carving of the back and sides of the throne suggest that this sculpture was not made as part of an altarpiece. It was probably intended to stand alone as a single religious image. The sculpture had been split down the middle vertically and was repaired by the V&A when they bought it. \n\nThe Museum thought the sculpture was English and dated it to around 1500.  However, in an exhibition catalogue of 1973, a writer suggested that the sculpture came from the Lower Rhine or Flanders about 1500. He suggested that the piece had either been imported, or made by a Continental carver working in East Anglia. This uncertainty reflects the difficulties experts have in identifying wood sculptures that were made in England in the years 1450-1540. Many such sculptures were burnt during the Reformation, when Protestants destroyed what they saw as Roman Catholic images. Even pieces that have a long and reliable record in an English setting may have been imported.",
