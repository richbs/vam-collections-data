Italian goldsmiths were expert at making a little material go a very long way. Many pieces seem too large to wear comfortably, but they are usually made of very thin gold, and are much lighter than they appear.  \n\nAll Italian women wore gold earrings. Their shapes varied widely in different places. This earring comes from Genoa, but could have been worn anywhere in Italy. Genoa was one of the most important centres for popular jewellery in the 19th century, and it is notable that most of the Genoese pieces in the Castellani collection are individually priced.\n\nIt was bought for \u00a31 16s.
