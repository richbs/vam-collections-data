It would have been worn as a brooch if the child was a girl and on the forehead if the child was a boy. The Kabyle are a Berber people from North Eastern Algeria. The \"brooch\" is made of silver, decorated with brightly coloured enamelled filigree and set with corals. Coral was believed to contain baraka (good luck) and to protect children and communities from evil.\n\nThis brooch was probably made by a Jewish silversmith as the Berbers thought working with metal was an inferior occupation. The filigree and enamelling techniques used here ware introduced to North Africa in the late fifteenth century by Jewish immigrants fleeing persecution in Europe.  Jewish silversmiths dominated jewellery making in North Africa until the late nineteenth century.",
