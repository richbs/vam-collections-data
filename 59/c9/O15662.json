In February 1947 Christian Dior had launched the New Look featuring pinched waists, full skirts and a soft shoulder line. It was an attempt to reinstate feminity in dress after a period of wartime austerity and shortage. The impractical scale and frivolity of Steibel's bow was clearly a defiant gesture against rationing. It makes lavish use of material and is so large and weighty that it requires the support of a sturdy horsehair frill beneath the skirts.\n\nVictor Steibel was born in South Africa. He moved to London in 1924 to study at Cambridge. Following an apprenticeship with the Reville and Rossiter fashion house, he opened his own Bruton Street couture house in 1932. After the Second World War he worked with Jacqmar and reopened his couture house in Cavendish Square in 1958. Steibel was a highly successful British designer, celebrated for his stylish feminine clothing, striped fabrics and evening wear.",

There are fine stripes like those shown here - in light or bright colours on a dark ground or vice versa\u2026 It is new to see an immensely full ballet skirt over a narrow underskirt; or a rather longer ballet skirt dress for young party going; in [this dress] above\u2026 stripes underline the essential character.\nde la Haye, A., 'Material Evidence' in Wilcox, C., ed., <i>The Golden Age of Couture: Paris and London 1947-57</i> (V&A Publications, 2007),\nFor his Autumn/Winter 1947-8 collection, Victor Stiebel designed a yellow-green striped late-afternoon dress in silk grosgrain with a distinctive bustle bow which was worn and given to the V&A by Lady Cornwallis.  It was a stylish and ingenious interpretation of the New Look.",
