The ground of the border has been quilted with white silk in a scale-like pattern.  There is an inner and outer border with a green undulating stem forming rounded arches over small outward facing red pointed flowers. The main section has a lobed roundel in the centre formed by a green band with red spots. There is a red and white flower in the centre enclosed within an 8-pointed star which links 4 large red and white full flowers and 4 green and yellow flowers in profile only.  A pair of serrated leaves and a small trefoil flower emerge from the top of each of these flowers. There are 12 floral sprigs in each half of the ground, with  a red flower bending to the left.  They are upright in the lower half, and downward pointing in the upper half. A quarter of the roundel is in each corner. The ground is quilted in a scale pattern. Note: although the flowers face towards the centre, the scales of the quilting all point in one direction.\nThreads: red, green, yellow and white.",
