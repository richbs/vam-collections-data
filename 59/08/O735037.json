H. Collins Baker) \n \nTonks had considerable importance as a  teacher and was Slade Professor from 1917 to 1930. He emphasised the importance of drawing for a painter, writing: \u2018Italy up to near the end of the 16th century will always be the best school for all who want to learn what  drawing can explain\u2026As it is by drawings that we make our records of form, its importance cannot be exaggerated. A school of painting in which drawing is not taught and drawing dissociated with painting is not worth of the name of school. When the student begins in paint he will soon perceive the relation of drawing to paint.\u2019 \n(J. Hare, <i>The Life of Henry Tonks</i>, 1939, \npp. 172, 173)\"\n<u>Victoria and Albert Museum, Department of Engraving, Illustration and Design and Department of Paintings, Accessions 1937</u>, London: Board of Education, 1938.\nThe full text of the record is as follows:\n\n<b>'TONKS, Professor Henry, F.R.C.S.
