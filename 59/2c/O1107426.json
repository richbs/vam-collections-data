            "history_note": "This engraving featured in Thomas Bewick's first major independent publication, <i>A General History of Quadrupeds</i>, first printed and published in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1790. The publication contains illustrations of animals, alongside brief descriptions of their appearance, habits and habitats, accompanied by a number of illustrative vignettes, used mainly as tailpieces. \n\nThe text accompanying the illustration (in the publication) reads as follows: \n'<i>THE TAIL-LESS MARMOT. \nWe are favoured by Mr Pennant with the drawing of this animal, which has hitherto been undescribed. --In the form of its body, it seems to agree with the description given of the Zisel, and probably may be a variety of that animal.</i>' \n\nTaken from: Beilby, Ralph and Bewick, Thomas. <u>A General History of Quadrupeds</u>. Newcastle upon Tyne. Third Edition, 1792.\n\nHistorical significance: Thomas Bewick was the first engraver to exploit fully the advantages of end-grain wood (the wood is cut across, rather than along, the grain). Once it had been proved that the technique could rival the fine effects of metal engraving, the advantages of wood engraving to the book trade were quickly recognised. Allowing both text and illustration to be printed in one operation, it ousted the intaglio process as the favourite for book illustration and was only superseded at the end of the nineteenth century when methods of photomechanical reproduction were developed.",
