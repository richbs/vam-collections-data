The centre of the shawl is surrounded by an approx. 14cm border of small, slanting cones of tiny blue and pinky-red flowers, with a filling of similar flowers between.\nAt either end is a 38cm border with tall, straight cones and bright red and blue flowers, plus a few red serpentine shapes in the centre. The cones grown from a segment of red and green-blue flowers and leaves. Between these large cones are short stems of alternate white and red blotches, edged with dark blue, bearing small cones of the same tiny flowers in red and blue.\nAt the top and bottom of these end panels run narrow borders of an angular meander, pale green stems and leaves edged in olive green, bearing flowers in red and blue, edged with thin blue bands with green leaves edged in red. The same meander and outer blue band run along the sides of the shawl, but the leaves are a darker green and edged with dark blue instead of green. These side borders were woven separately and attached.\nThere is a twisted warp fringe at either end, on a narrow piece of woven wool and silk, also attached.",
