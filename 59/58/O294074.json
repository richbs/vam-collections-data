In 1935 his son Charles Goldsmith entered the firm with the aim of making glasses a fashion item. From the company\u2019s offices in Poland Street, his sons A. Oliver and Ray Goldsmith built upon the company\u2019s reputation for attention-grabbing designs and solicited celebrity endorsement for their products. Key clients included Lord Snowdon, the actress Diana Dors, Princess Grace of Monaco and Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\nA. Oliver Goldsmith designed this frame, titled \u2018Sloanes to a Punk Party\u2019, as an alternative to practical eyewear available at the time. He asked his office workers to go through their desks and bring out small items, which were then attached to the frames: chains, safety pins and paperclips. The design was popular with Goldsmith\u2019s mainstream clients, who, as this design\u2019s title suggests, could appropriate a bit of punk\u2019s rebelliousness by sporting these frames.",
