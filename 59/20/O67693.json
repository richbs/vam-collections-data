            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nThis candlestick, one of a pair, has a single column with a detachable drip pan and is designed to hold a single candlestick.\n\nMaterials & Making\nWith the exception of engraving, which remained a traditional craft technique, the skills used in the plating workshops were emerging industrial techniques which changed the character of the silver industry itself. This candlestick, made of Sheffield plate, is assembled from die-stamped sections which are soldered together. The investment in dies was substantial. Dies once cut, had to be used as economically as possible, and not only were the same dies used for silver and plate production within the same manufacturing firm, they were exchanged with other firms so that they could be used and re-used in as many different combinations as possible.\n\nPlaces\nUntil the advent of the Sheffield plating industry, there was no silver trade in Sheffield. Its development was closely dependent on the growth of the plating industry. Not only was the basic material of the plating industry significantly cheaper than sterling silver, with which it directly competed, but the manufacturing techniques quickly developed along much more industrialised and economical lines. Thus the Sheffield silversmiths could, by using techniques learned from their colleagues in the plating industry, cheaply produce silver candlesticks in a variety of designs which greatly appealed to the market and which significantly undercut their London rivals.",
