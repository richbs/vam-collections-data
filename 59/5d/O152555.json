The works share an eerie, spectral quality, depicting shadowy spaces occupied by a strange combination of old children's toys and plants. There is an air of menace to all the works: a lily dwarfs the miniature rooms of a doll's house; an aggressive flowering plant looms over a staircase; a toy skeleton stands in the shadows with its back to the wall and an abandoned children's bedroom is shown in a state of chaotic disrepair.\n\nThe technique of photogravure, employed in this print, is often used to create atmospheric images. Using a photographic negative and light-sensitised gelatine, an image is transferred to a printing plate to be etched and then inked and printed in the usual way.",
