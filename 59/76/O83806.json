So too is the use of different textures, such as the contrast here between the chunky wool background and the soft chenille used for the oak leaves. These have been worked using the intarsia technique. This involves the knitter using a separate length of yarn for each block of colour across the row, so that the yarns are not carried across the entire row which makes up the motifs.\n\nSasha Kagan trained as a painter and printmaker before moving to rural Wales. Her knitwear is inspired by the local landscape and by William Morris's Arts and Crafts textile designs. She and her studio assistants hand-knit all her designs using natural yarns.",
