From the 1980s onwards, Arad often produced furniture and lighting from salvaged materials, transforming 'found' objects into limited edition furniture.\n\n'Soft Little Heavy'  is an interpretation of Arad's earlier design, 'Little Heavy' (an example of which is in the V&A's collection, W.17-1993).  Arad transformed his early metal version of the chair, made from beaten steel and produced in his own workshop, into an upholstered version to be made by the Italian manufacturer Moroso. Although the volume and shape of the original design was retained, the change of material, from beaten metal to upholstery, radically alters the character of the chair. The re-creation of a radical, one-off design as a manufactured commodity suitable for mass-consumption was typical of the appetite of the design market towards the end of the 20th century.",
