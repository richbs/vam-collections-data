            "public_access_description": "The poster \u2018Vote for your Poland\u2019 recalls a poster created in 1982 by Jan Bokiewicz depicting a dark space with a barred window. Bokiewicz\u2019s poster was a reaction to the mass imprisoning of Solidarity activists after the proclamation of the Martial Law in December 1981. This optimistic poster shares the same motif and composition, but, in contrast, it depicts an illuminated space with an open window and a cheerful landscape behind. It reflects an optimism which accompanied the first democratic elections in Poland in June 1989. The poster was also used to support some of the individual Solidarity candidates. It was easily transformed by pasting a piece of paper with a name of the candidate over the blank space. This shows the circumstances of the Solidarity campaign which was often conducted spontaneously and unprofessionally because of a shortage of money, time and a professional staff.\n\nSolidarity, founded in September 1980, was the first free trade union in an Eastern Bloc country. It became the leading political force opposing the communist regime in Poland. Eventually the Polish Government was forced to negotiate with the Solidarity-led opposition, resulting in semi-free elections on 4th June 1989. This marked a crucial stage in the democratic transformation of Central and Eastern Europe.",
