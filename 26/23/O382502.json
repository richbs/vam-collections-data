Old Hungarian jewellery was very popular in Britain in the 19th century, and was extensively copied and reproduced by goldsmiths throughout the Austro- Hungarian Empire until well into the 20th century.  \n\nThe main components of the clasp are gold buttons set with pearls and garnets.  These are probably early 18th century in date, and would originally have been part of the traditional man's costume which had become official court dress by the 19th century.  The turquoise enamelled piece in the centre was probably a link from a necklace or bracelet, as it has parallel tubes running along its back.  The plaque hanging below it has bars on the back, showing it was originally worn as a slide on a ribbon, and also probably dates from the early 18th century.  The little pendant of St. George may be even earlier.",
