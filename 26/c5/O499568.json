            "public_access_description": "Edward Wadsworth (1889-1949) was a leading member of the Vorticist group of painters, active in England in the years around the time of the First World War. However, during the 1920s his style developed away from an abstraction based on mechanised forms, and towards a more straightforward realism. \n\nWadsworth rarely drew for its own sake (with the exception of a group of views of the industrial landscape of the Black Country dating from 1919), with the result that his drawings are relatively rare; most date from the years 1919 to 1925. \n\n'Chee Dale, Derbyshire' was executed in 1922, when Wadsworth and his wife went to stay with his cousin Walter in the Derbyshire Peak District in order to recuperate after the death of their eldest daughter Anne, aged nine, in March of that year. Other drawings or tempera paintings completed during this visit to the area depict Glossop, Buxton, Broadbottom, Chapel-en-le-Frith and Stockport.",
