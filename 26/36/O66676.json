            "public_access_description": "The fragments of glass illustrated on this panel were for the most part made in England in the 15th century. They once formed part of the private collection of English medieval glass of Grosvenor Thomas who gave the fragments to the Victoria & Albert Museum in 1915. Subsequently, the museum framed them up in this panel for study purposes.\n\nEngland had a rich tradition of stained glass in the Middle Ages but due to the political and religious upheavals of the 16th and 17th centuries, much survives only in a fragmentary state as you see here.\n\nThe fragment here depicts a pig wearing a bell collar and standing on a tiled floor. Although it is only part of what had been a larger image, we can be reasonably sure that it represents the attribute of St Anthony the Great. St Anthony was born in the middle of the third century in Egypt. He embraced the Christian faith and after some years retired to the desert to live the life of a hermit. He inspired many others with his faith and they came to the desert to follow his example. He is known as the founder of Christian monasticism for this reason although the form of monasticism which later dominated in the Christian west was that established by St Benedict in the 6th century.\n\nA legend developed that St Anthony faced many torments sent by the devil during his sojourn in the desert. One of these torments came in the form of a wild pig that tried to attack him. The pig was tamed by St Anthony's prayers and eventually this animal became associated with the saint and is his attribute as depicted in medieval art. The followers of St Anthony raised pigs and tied bells around their necks to distinguish them from non 'Anthonite pigs'.\n\nOther interesting fragments on this panel include a jousting helmet (Museum no. C.348-1915) and a bishop's mitre (Museum no. C.386-1915).\n\nThe majority of the fragments on this panel are painted on the reverse with silver stain which, when fired in the kiln, turns a yellow to orange colour. This technique of decorating window glass first developed around 1300. Many panels from the 14th and 15th centuries are decorated simply in yellow (silver) stain and highlighted with a brown/black pigment.",
