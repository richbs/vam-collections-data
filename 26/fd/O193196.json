It nests within a square which is of a slightly paler toned red. This paler red square nests within a brown square.  On this outer square is a superimposed  square defined as a line drawing rather than a solid mass. It is  drawn as a thin white line. The effect is to make the brown on one side of the white line appear tonally different (albeit very subtley) from the brown on the other side. \nThe squares are nesting so that the margins at the top and sides are wider than those at the base",

He worked in a variety of media but has become widely recognised through his later printed work, based  on the exploration of  colour. \n\n In 1949  he wrote a definitive text on colour theory and soon after began work on the series of coloured squares and rectangles which came to dominate his work and which explored the idea of colour as an illusion, depending on context. \"We do not  see colours as they really are\" he wrote \"in our perception they alter one another\"  Although he began his experiments in this field with paint, he came to depend on the planographic print processes, particularly screen-print, because through them consistent evenness of colour could be produced easily and with great speed.",
