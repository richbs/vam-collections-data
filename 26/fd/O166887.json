The design can be worked in one of two ways. The first is to stitch the cord to one layer of material. The second is to quilt together two layers of material and insert the cord after the sewing is completed. The latter is the most common technique used in cord quilts of this period. \n\nLinen cord quilts became particularly fashionable in English homes at the end of the seventeenth century, at a time when the bedroom was a site of public display: a place where servants entered, family members rested and guests were entertained. Cord quilts were created by both professional and domestic quilt makers, and provided a practical (readily washable) and restful alternative to the highly patterned and colourful bed covers also fashionable at this time.",
