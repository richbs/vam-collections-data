            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nCandlesticks were an essential part of every home at this time, used either with expensive wax candles or cheaper tallow tapers. Silver or silver-gilt candlesticks were generally used by the wealthy. Poorer people often used pewter or brass. The refined decoration of this object shows the influence of the French court over Restoration England.\n\nPeople\nJacob Bodendick was a goldsmith of German birth who was active in England between 1660-80. He was born in Germany and arrived in London around 1660. He worked for the court of Charles II and produced metalwork for the King's Jewel House.\n\nForeign or 'alien' goldsmiths working for the royal court aroused the anger of the Goldsmiths' Company, provoking complaints about the unemployment of native goldsmiths. In 1664 Bodendick presented a letter from Charles II to the Wardens of the Goldsmiths' Company, ordering them to mark and assay his work to allow him to sell it in the same way as a native goldsmith. In his letter the King gave assurances that Bodendick and other alien goldsmiths should 'imploy his Native subjects and not strangers in their manufacture'.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe clustered column and ogee-shaped base were particularly popular in The Netherlands in the 1640s. However, the acanthus decoration on the foot is a French innovation made popular from the 1650s through the engravings the Italian etcher and draughtsman Stefano della Bella. This is a wonderful example of the large and flamboyant tableware and furnishing silver of Restoration England.",
