At the corners the blue field is shaped to create a white triangle. This contains a large red boteh and borders onto the dark blue field with a stepped outline in red with a multi-coloured central line. This also outlines the central medallion which is diamond shaped with a pendant at each corner. The pendants top and bottom contain a cross and at the sides is a rosette. In the centre of the medallion is a blue square motif within an orange hexagon within a red border. The field is decorated with 3 rows of complex designs: there is a diamond outlined in red with a barbed line at one end and a pendant containing a blossom at the other. There are diagonal, multi-coloured serrated leaves and large birds and small and larger geometric motifs to the side. Running across the field between these designs are 3 horizontal bars joined at regular intervals by red blossoms and multi-coloured rosettes.\n\nMAIN BORDER: red ground decorated with segmented triangles arranged to form a block with a serrated diagonal leaf between. These alternate with an angular rosette.\n\nINNER (light green ground) and OUTER (orange ground) BORDERS: a quartered almond alternating with a pair of opposed triangles.\n\nUpper and lower bands beyond borders: three chequered bands - blue/white red/yellow, blue/white.\n\nWARP: white and dark brown wool, usually plied together; Z2S; 18-22 threads per inch (75-84 per dm).\n\nWEFT: red wool; Z-spun, unplied; 2 shoots after each row of knots; 9-12 knots per inch (35-50 per dm).\n\nPILE: wool. 12 colours: red, orange, yellow, dark green, light green, dark blue, blue, light blue, dark brown, brown, black, white; asymmetrical knot, open to the right tied around 2 threads; 81-132 per sq. inch (1312-2100 per sq. dm).\n\nSIDE FINISH: one cord oversewn with red and yellow wool.\n\nEND FINISH: lower: incomplete. Upper: one pass or red and yellow weft twining with loose warp threads max. 16.5 cm long secured at top and bottom with a knot.",
