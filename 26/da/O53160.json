            "production_note": "This chair is of nearly identical model to the long set made for the Embroidered Bedroom and the Cabinet at Houghton, which are likely to be by Thomas Roberts junior. A long account from Roberts to Sir Robert Walpole survives at Houghton, for work carried out c. 1729, chiefly for houses in London. Given that Walpole discarded almost all the accounts relating to the furnishing of the state apartment at Houghton, this isolated bill is the only documentary clue to the maker of this furniture.",
