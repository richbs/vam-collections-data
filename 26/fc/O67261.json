Each blue bar divides a double-hooked red open diamond containing stylised flowerheads and leaves that appear elsewhere in the medallion.  A horizontal green bar runs across the centre with a red rosette to either end. The medallion has a small dark red pendant above and below.  In each corner is a large green pineapple-like motif filled with a stylised floral sprig.  The stylised flowerheads from the medallion appear on the field along with small dark blue cloud bands.\nMain border: blue ground, light blue towards the upper end with lozenges and large  brackets between star-like rosettes with pairs of small triangles along the sides.   Along the lower and upper main border the rosettes are paired and have no triangles and the brackets are less regular in shape and have large dark blue hooks.           \nInner and outer borders: red and white spots.\nUpper and lower band: red and green blocks.",
