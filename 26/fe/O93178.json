Part of the base has been lost, and in many areas the details of the figure have been lost through polishing. The head of  Christ is a later restoration, most probably in the Castellani workshops in Rome in the 19th century. The proportions of both figures are elongated. Both are identified by small inscriptions on their robes. A lozenge-pattern of dots is visible on the Mother of God's cloak, suggesting that the figure was originally painted and gilded. There is a large dowel hole on the underside, extending 7cm into the statuette.",

As the mediator between suffering mankind and Christ and the protectress of Constantinople, she was widely venerated. \nMost images of the Virgin stress her role as Christ's Mother, showing her standing and holding her son.",

Fortnum, Rome, 3rd April, 1884, lot 584, \u00a394. \nThe statue represents the Theotokos Hodegetria, the 'Mother of God showing the Way' by gesturing towards the Christ Child, a type derived from the celebrated miracle-working icon kept in the Hodegon monastery in Constantinople.\nThe original setting of this unique statuette reamins uncertain.\n\nHistorical significance: The Virgin and Child was an especially popular subject for Byxzantine artists. These representations were invariably in relief, either on a large scale in marble or in smaller versions in ivory, metalwork or semi-precious stones.\n\nStatuary in the round is almost unknown in Byzantine Art - this is the sole surviving example - although there is said to have ben an ivory statue of St Helena in Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, other similar surviving sculptural represantation are all reliefs. There is a monumental marble version in the Istanbul Archeological Museum which is very close, and several ivory plaques, which probably once formed the central panels of triptychs, survive in various museums. The basic format of the Hodegetria remains unchanged; even the drapery patterns hardly vary from one piece to another.\nAlthough the statuette is the only known Byzantine ivory sculpture carved entirely in the round, it is closely related to a small group of Virgin and Child ivory reliefs in Utrecht, Li\u00e8ge, Hamburg and New York, which originally formed the centres of triptychs.",

            "historical_context_note": "The figure was probably placed in a small tabernacle to be viewed from all sides.\n\nThe Virgin Mary, known as the Theotokos in Greek terminology, was central to Byzantine spirituality as one of its most important religious figures. As the mediator between suffering mankind and Christ and the protectress of Constantinople, she was widely venerated. \nMost images of the Virgin stress her role as Christ's Mother, showing her standing and holding her son. The manner in which the Virgin holds Christ is very particular. Certain poses developed into \"types\" that became names of sanctuaries or poetic epithets. For example, the Virgin Hodegetria is a popular representation of the Virgin in which she holds Christ on her left arm and gestures toward him with her right hand, showing that he is the way to salvation. The name Hodegetria comes from the Hodegon Monastery in Constantinople, in which the icon showing the Virgin in this particular stance resided from at least the twelfth century onward, acting to protect the city.",
