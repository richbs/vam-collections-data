The bowl has an uneven base and is covered with a crackled celadon glaze.  The interior is plain while the exterior is decorated with two rows of overlapping lotus petals. The base has three spur marks surrounding a small impressed circle.  Repaired with gold lacquer at mouth.\n\nLotus petals in double layers are sharply carved in relief on the exterior. A dark greenish glaze with a lustrous finish covers the entire surface of the bowl. Part of the rim has been repaired. The low foot has the symbol \u2018O\u2019 incised on its inside. The bowl, which was produced at a kiln in Gangjin in the early 13th century, is similar to a lotus-petal patterned bowl excavated from the seabed off the coast of Wonsando Island in Boryeong..",

            "public_access_description": "In many respects ceramics reached their zenith during the four centuries of the Koryo kingdom (918-1392 AD) when porcellanous stonewares with soft, gentle lines and a fine, bluish-green glaze, known as celadon, were made. Praised for their outstanding beauty as reflected in their sumptuous glazes, refined forms and elegant decorations, they are seen to exemplify one of the highlights of Korean culture. The word \u2018celadon\u2019 derives from the colour of the robe worn by Celadon, hero of L\u2019Astr\u00e9e, a pastoral drama by Honor\u00e9 d\u2019Urf\u00e9, a French dramatist of the seventeenth century. Today the term is used for both Chinese and Korean stonewares with glazes of grey-green to bluish-green hues.\n \nThe Koryo dynasty witnessed a hitherto unprecedented rise in the production and development of not only ceramics but also of other arts, notably metalwork, lacquer ware and paintings. Many were made for the use in Buddhist ceremonies, which occupied a vital place within Koryo society. Buddhist motifs also feature strongly in celadon wares as is the case of this bowl with a carved design of overlapping lotus petals. There is no decoration on the inside of the bowl. It dates from the first half of the 12th century, when several wares of this type were made. The greenish-grey coloured glaze is finely crackled, producing a clear, translucent effect. Its glaze, elegant shape and organic motif are typical characteristics of celadons made during the Koryo dynasty (918-1392).",
