Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hard-wearing. Above all, they had to have the means for attaching a cord. Netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated being the katabori (shape carving), a three-dimensional carving, such as this one in the form of Taira no Tadamori mistakenly attacking the oil thief.\n\nTaira no Tadamori, founder of the famous Taira clan, was a skilful 12th-century general. According to popular legend, Tadamori was out walking with the emperor one dark night in the pouring rain, when a passer-by told them of a terrifying demon emitting flames who was roaming the road leading to the Gion temple. The emperor immediately sent Tadamori to track him down and, before long, Tadamori came upon the creature. Without hesitation, he crept up behind and killed it. It was only then that he realised the creature was none other than a priest with a large hat and straw cape lighting the temple lanterns. His torch had made it seem as though he were emitting flames. This story is usually referred to as Taira no Tadamori mistakenly attacking the \u2018oil thief\u2019.\n\nDuring the 17th and early 18th centuries, katabori netsuke had been greatly influenced by Chinese subjects. From the mid 18th century onwards, there was a resurgence of Japanese stories and legends, such as this one. Showing two men in combat, this is a rare example of a netsuke that conveys action. Both men grimace as they fight, while their clothes are skilfully carved so that they appear to be moving.",
