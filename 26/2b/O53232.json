It was designed by Philip Webb, whose 1862-63 account book records designs for three sideboards and work on painted and lacquered leather panels.  Some of these panels were intended for a sideboard and it is possible they form part of this one.\n\nThe upper part of the sideboard is almost identical to that illustrated in colour as the frontispiece to Morris & Company\u2019s catalogue of Specimens of Furniture Upholstery & Interior Decoration, but the lower part has been slightly modified.  The base of this particular example was originally open but is now filled with drawers.",

This sideboard may be one of those early commissions. The leather panels with birds and flowers set in roundels and stiff, floral trails are very similar to those on the sideboard illustrated in colour as the frontispiece to Morris & Company's catalogue, <u>Furniture & Decorative Work</u>, c. 1912, and described as being made in 'in the earliest days of the firm at Red Lion Square (c.1862)'.\n\nThe base of the sideboard appears to have been altered. The three drawers along the bottom of the sideboard may be later additions. The two plain drawer fronts were inserted to replace missing drawers by furniture conservators in the Museum after the sideboard was acquired..\n\nIn 1971 this sideboard was on display in the Green Dining Room, originally decorated by Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co. in 1866.",
