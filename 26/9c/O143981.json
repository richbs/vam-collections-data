The figures were modelled by hand separately and then attached to the basic structure of the inkstand. The whole is incised to show details in the hair and costume of the figures as well as stylised foliage on the base and upper structure. There are two similar candlesticks, another in the Victoria & Albert Museum and one in the Kuntsgewerbemuseum in Berlin. It is believed that all three were made in the same pottery workshop in either Bologna or Ferrara.\n\nOn the base and held by one of the female figures, are generally held to be the arms of the Rangoni family of Modena (Barry on a chief an escallop). Another female figure sitting on the base holds a shield with an unidentified coat of arms. The female figure seated on the top of the candlestick bears a shield with the impaled arms of Bentivoglio of Bologna (per bend indented) and Rangoni. It is believed that the candlestick was commissioned to commemorate a marriage between the two families.",

He assumes they were commissioned by Giovanni Bentivoglio from a local Bologna pottery. Honey also assumes that no more of these inkstands with the Bentivoglio and Rangoni arms were made after Giovanni was expelled from Bologna in 1506 by Pope Julius II.\n\nWasters have been found in the ramparts of Bologna which also beat the arms of Bentivoglio. Giovanni Bentivoglio was expelled from Bologna in 1506 and died two years later. \n\nNepoti in the Faenza catalogue lists many fragments with the arms of Bentivoglio, the arms of Rangoni and the two arms impaled. He says that ceramics with this type of 'bentivolesco' arms are common in the kiln waste discovered in Bologna. However, they are also found in Ferrara (without saying if they were found on kiln sites). He also says that dishes with the Bentivoligo arms were also produced after his exile from Bologna in 1506.\nNepoti states that the arms with the scallop shell in chief are 'generally' attributed to Rangoni of Modena. These arma are found on many ceramics in Ferrara collections but are also found in Bologna.",

Elena's mother was a Sanvitale. The Rangoni arms are in the form usual before the addition, in 1511, of a second chief. The unidentified coat may have some reference to that of Sanvitale which, however, shows a bend gules on an argent field without the mullets.",
