Various members of a sitter's family would want their own canvases of their famous or notorious ancestors. There are at least three versions of this painting, and a descendant of Rochester's family owned this one until 1875.\n\n  People\nJohn Wilmot, Earl of Rochester (1647-1680) is shown here in pseudo-Roman dress, with a cuirass or steel breastplate, as he had distinguished himself by his bravery in a battle at sea.  Yet his real fame was as a courtier, wit, rake, and a poet whose obscene satires and other poems could not be published openly until the end of the 20th century. A patron of other poets including John Dryden, Rochester was often dismissed from court in disgrace. His life was divided between domesticity in the country and a riotous existence at court, where he was renowned for drunkenness, vivacious conversation, and 'extravagant frolics'.\n\nSir Peter Lely, a Dutch artist who worked most of his life in London, was the leading portrait painter at court. He is most famous for his portraits of women at the court of Charles II.",
