            "bibliography": "Ward-Jackson, Peter, Italian Drawings Volume I. 14th-16th century, London, 1979, p. 213. The text is as follows: LOMBARDY: mid 16th century 466 <i>Recto</i> Design for grotesque ornament: a mask (with an alternative mask above) flanked by a pair of naked boys among scrolls of acanthus Pen and ink over black chalk Size of sheet 8 x 61 (203 x 158) E.4474-1920 <i>Verso </i>Design for a sauce-boat or other dish. In the top right hand corner a medallion containing a bearded man's head in profile faintly sketched in black chalk Pen and ink over black chalk PROVENANCE Grahl (Lugt 1199); Benno Geiger (sale, Sotheby, 7 and 9 December 1920, lot no. 297; bought by the Museum) LITERATURE Planiscig and Voss, no. 15 and pl. 15 Planiscig and Voss thought that the drawing was by the same hand as a somewhat similar sheet in the Albertina (Albertina Catalogue, 6, no. 403, pI. 89); and the Albertina drawing, traditionally ascribed to Credi, was attributed to Cesare da Sesto by Meder, who believed it to be by the same hand as the sketchbook in the Pierpont Morgan Library which Fairfax Murray published as by Cesare (Fairfax Murray, Two Lombard sketch Books, London, 1910). But our drawing is by a different hand. It is drawn with the left hand, whereas the other drawings are right-handed. Moreover, the anatomy of the kneeling man on the verso is defective and reveals characteristics that cannot be found in the other drawings. The handling of the pen recalls Girolamo da Carpi, and the drawing is probably by an artist who imitated his style. As Pouncey has pointed out (orally), there are two drawings (verso and recto) in the Pierpont Morgan Library by the same hand (vol. I, 34A and 34B). The recto represents a man holding a scallop shell on his shoulder, with two other sketches. The verso shows designs for acanthus scrolls, with a male nude, very similar to the recto of our drawing. These are left-handed drawings too.",
