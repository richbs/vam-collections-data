            "physical_description": "Brass stand for a tray for serving food. It consists of two truncated cones of brass joined at their narrow ends, with a flat circular rim at the wider ends. The rims are both decorated on the upper side only. The two 'cones' have roughly the same decoration: the main element is a large inscription in Arabic, in the <i>thulth</i> style, in two sections divided by two large roundels with cusped edges. The roundels contain lotus ornament surrounding an epigraphic blazon that contains the wording \"al-Malik al-Na[sir]\". The main inscription consists of fragments of a set of official titles, with a first section reading, \"al-maqarr al-'ali al-maw[lawi]\" or \"al-mawlaw[i]\". The texts in the second sections differ.\n\nAbove and below the main inscriptions are bands divided into compartments filled with lotus ornament. At the top of the lower 'cone', there is a further band containing a repeat pattern. It is likely that a similar band once decorated the upper 'cone' but has been removed, along with the torus moulding that would have joined the two 'cones' at their narrow ends. As a result, the top half now measures roughly 20.7 cm in height, while the lower half measures about 24 cm in height. This means, too, that the diameter of  the two halves does not match where they are now joined -- the top half at its base is wider than the diameter of the bottom half at its top. The top half has therefore been fitted over the bottom half, and the two have been soldered together. \n\nThe stand would presumably have been inlaid with silver and a black compound over much of its surface, as about 100 small areas of silver inlay survive, as well as some of the black inlay.",
