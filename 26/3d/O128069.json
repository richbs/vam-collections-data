Educated at Abingdon Grammar School and entered RA Schools 1819. Visited Italy 1827 for about two years to study Italian old masters. Exhibited 85 works at the RA between 1818 and 1866 (and one posthumously in 1880); almost all were portraits of the artistic, literary and ecclesiastical establishment. Also exhibited other subjects: 11 at the BI 1826-44, and 7 at the SBA 1827-32. Elected ARA 1851, RA 1863. Director of the NG 1866-74. Knighted 1871. Died London 6 December 1879. His studio sale was at Christie's 8 June 1880. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i>1880, p83 (obit); <i>Portfolio</i>1880, p17 (obit); <i>The Fortnightly Review</i>1 February 1880 (memoir by Lord Coleridge); M Levey 'A Little-Known Director: Sir William Boxall', <i>Apollo</i>May 1975, pp354-9\n\n<b>Walter Savage Landor </b> \nF3 Neg 76972 \nPanel, 60.2 X 45 cm (23 1/2 X 17 1/2 ins) \nForster Bequest 1876 \n\nCommissioned by John Forster in January 1852, and exhibited at the RA in 1853. The portrait shows WaIter Savage Landor (1775-1864) at the age of 77. Landor, although he said 'I neither am not ever shall be popular', is still remembered today for his innovatory literary form, the <i>Imaginary Conversations,</i>in which he described imagined meetings between famous people at crucial junctures in their careers. A poet, and always a controversial figure, he was a member of the Romantic circle of Byron, Shelley, Southey and Wordsworth, and later a friend of Forster and Dickens, who portrayed him in the character of Boythorne in <i>Bleak House.</i>Richard Renton called him 'one of John Forster's warmest friends', although they seem to have quarrelled in later years (<i>John Forster and His Friendships</i>1912, p164) \n\nEarly in 1852 there was a scheme to publish the <i>Imaginary Conversations</i>between classical speakers in a single and separate volume; Super suggests this was possibly Forster's idea. Forster wanted a portrait of Landor to be engraved as a frontispiece, and in January 1852 he commissioned Boxall. The volume was printed by July 1852 but was not published until April 1853; Super suggests this delay was caused by the fact that Boxall had not finished the portrait, although in the event his portrait was not engraved for the volume. Boxall visited Landor in Bath in early December 1852 to complete the portrait, the last sitting being 8 December. Landor wrote to Forster late in 1852 (quoted by Super, p411) that 'The price of Boxall for a portrait I believe is high, but he is incomparably our best painter. I have seen pictures by him which would have done honour to Titian. His hands are full at present'. He also wrote to Forster that he was not to publish the portrait 'until I have left the world', an indication of his reclusive nature. The portrait was engraved, after Landor's death, for the 1869 edition of Forster's biography of Landor. \n\nLandor told his friend Anthony Rosenhagen that the portrait was 'considered to be a very good likeness' (Super, p415), but when it was exhibited at the RA in 1853 he did not leave Bath for London to see it. <i>The Examiner</i>thought it 'a masterpiece both in truth of likeness and beauty of painting', and the <i>Athenaeum</i>critic could 'vouch for the perfect resemblance no less than for the artistical skill'. The <i>Art Journal,</i>however, called it 'a small study, very simple in treatment, and we think unhealthy in complexion'. \n\nOn 15 December 1856 the diarist Henry Crabb Robinson received a gift of what he thought was Boxall's portrait - 'a handsome present' - but realised two days later that it was the portrait by William Fisher, 'more striking as a likeness'. Super believes the portrait to be a failure, and rendered worse in the 'rather simpering head' engraved for Forster's 1869 biography. Super (pp594, n95) quotes Dickens from <i>All The Year Round</i>(24 July 1869, pp181-2): \n\nDickens noted that Landor had peculiar arms, rather short, and 'curiously restrained and checked in their action at the elbows; in the action of the hands, even when separately clenched, there was the same kind of pause. Let the face be never so intense or fierce, there was a commentary of gentleness in the hands, essential to be taken along with it ...'. \nThere are several portraits of Landor, including the William Fisher mentioned above, which Crabb Robinson eventually gave to the NPG; for a full iconography, see R Walker <i>Regency Portraits</i>1985, I, pp307-9. \n\nEXH: RA 1853 (159); an exhibition for National Library Week, Central Library, Museum and Art Gallery, Stafford, 1969; <i>Charles Dickens</i>V&A 1970 (P17) \n\nENGR: J Brown 1852, for publishers Chapman and Hall, in J Forster <i>Walter Savage Landor, a Biography</i>1869, frontispiece to vol II \n\nLIT: <i>Athenaeum</i>28 May 1853, p654; <i>Art Journal</i>1853, p141; <i>Examiner 1853,</i>p294; ed E J Morley <i>Henry Crabb Robinson on Books and their Writers</i>III, 1938, p764; RH Super <i>Walter Savage Landor</i>New York 1954, pp410-1, 415, 594 n95\"",
