The earliest versions were made from hollowed-out cow horns and used by shepherds and watchmen. By about 1250 they were made from hollowed-out ivory tusks or two pieces of wood joined together latitudinally and covered with leather. By about 1580 the best examples are thought to have come from Venice. Between about 1550 and 1650, the cornett enjoyed a prominent part in wind ensembles and was often used for displays of virtuosity . Its tone has been described as a cross between an alto saxophone and a clarinet, but it made great demands on the player. As Roger North (1653 - 1734), a keen amateur musician, observed ' ... the labour on the lips is too great and it is seldom well sounded', which might help explain its decline to obscurity by about 1700.\n\nOn loan to the Horniman Museum.",
