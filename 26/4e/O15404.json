            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nIn 1851, this chair was described as a drawing room chair. The shaped back and 'cabriole' legs indicate that it was inspired by French furniture styles of the 18th century, which were very fashionable for drawing rooms in the 1840s and 1850s. The pale colours and delicate embroidery on the original seat cover also show that the chair was intended for a feminine interior.\n\nPeople\nHenry Eyles, who designed and made this chair, was an upholsterer in Bath with premises at 31 Broad Street, in 1851 and subsequently at 7 Margaret's Buildings. He may have been connected with T.G. Eyles, a cabinetmaker, of 13 James Street, and George Eyles, a carver, of 4 Chandos Buildings. Both were listed in Bath street directories in 1860.\n\nHistorical Associations\nThis chair was exhibited by Henry Eyles in Class XXVI (Furniture) in the Great Exhibition of 1851. The unconventional use of the porcelain plaque with the image of Queen Victoria, and the Royal Arms embroidered on the seat, demonstrated his creative skills as well as offering a form of homage to the monarch. This technical ingenuity and combination of unusual materials was typical of much of the furniture shown in 1851.",
