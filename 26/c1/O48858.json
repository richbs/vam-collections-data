Milk is sold at fourpence per quart, or fivepence for a better sort: yet the advance of price does not ensure its purity, for it is generally mixed in a great proportion with water by the retailers before they leave the Milk-houses.  It is calculated that 8,500 cows are kept for the supply of Milk, and that 6,980,00 gallons are annually sold in London.  The adulteration of the Milk, added to the wholesale cost, leaves an average profit of cent. per cent. to the venders of this useful article.  The retail traders are exercised with equal gain.  A retailer of Milk, in opulent parts of the town, employs two to three carriers; these are, almost universally, Welsh girls, whose uncommon strength and hardiness of constitution peculiarly fit them for an employment of such great labour and constant exposure to the inclemencies of the weather.  \"Milk Walks\", that is, a certain  proportion of neighbouring streets served by a particular person, are sometimes disposed of by advertisement, and often for a considerable premium.  Cream is sold by the Milk-carrier at one shilling and fourpence per pint.'\n\nThere then follows a note about Cavendish Square, the location of the itinerant trader featured in the plate.",
