(worked c.1655-c.1660), Attributed to</b> \n\nMiniature portrait of an unknown lady, c.1655. \n<i>On vellum.</i>                     P.23-1954 \n\nPurchased from the funds of the R. H. Stephenson Bequest\"\nMurdoch, John. <u>Seventeenth-century English Miniatures in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum</u>. London: The Stationery Office, 1997\nCat.103, p.188. Full Citation:\n\n\"<b>103 Unknown Woman</b>\n<b>c.1660</b> \nP23-1954 \n\n<b>Oval 61 x41 mm</b> \n\nFeatures in brown and sanguine, hatched diagonally in blue-grey and heavily impasted with gouache, with red in the lips and black with a touch of white in the eyes, on a thick, pale carnation ground; hair in brown wash, hatched and lined with darker colour and with the lights and curls in pale gouache; the dress in pale brown wash, modelled and heightened with yellow and ochre gouache; the chemise in white, modelled and shaded in grey; the jewel in black over grey with a touch of white; background a dark gummy brown wash; on vellum put down on a leaf from a table-book. \n\n<b>Condition:</b> Cut down to its present size, possibly from a seated full-length. The present appearance of the surface, especially the shiny gum in the background and some gum accretions in the hair which were removed in recent conservation, suggests extensive water-damage: perhaps only the present area could be salvaged. \n\n<b>Signed:</b> Not signed. \n\n<b>Frame:</b> Late seventeenth- or early eighteenth-century silver parcel-gilt case of oblong shape, with four straight sides separated by wavy canted sections. The frame has a billet moulding between two channels and is hinged on one long side to attach two covers, which are fastened by lugs secured by a sprung-steel double hasp (one missing). Each cover is engraved and flat -chased with a symmetrical pattern of rectilinear strap and foliate scrolls, with a bird with outstretched wings in the centre, on a punched ground. In one side is an octagonal bevelled glass mirror, and in the other, secured by a slip-in cover-gilt and engraved with symmetrically repeated ornament of two foliate scrolls on a tooled ground, is the slightly convex glass. \n\nAccording to Charles Oman, 'the case is of German origin, c.1700, or a little before'. (1) Michael Snodin dates the case slightly later, commenting that the ornament seems to be a late, debased interpretation of this predominantly German ornament type; he also points out that the case is not designed to hold a miniature, and that it does so here very awkwardly. (2) \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> Bought from H E Backer, Park Street, Mayfair, in August 1954 with funds from the R H Stephenson Bequest. \n\n<b>Literature:</b> <i>Accessions</i> 1954, p. 113 (by D Gibson); <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 24. \n\nAcquired by the Museum as firmly attributed to \u2018D Gibson\u2019, and presumably recognised as such by Reynolds on the grounds of the marked diagonal striation across the entire flesh area of the sitter's figure. Technically, the miniature relates closely to other work by Gibson in the late 1650s and 1660s: here the dressing of the hair suggests c.1660. The pose is exceptional in miniature portraiture, but relates in Gibson's oeuvre to the <i>Elizabeth Capell, Countess of Carnarvon.</i> (3) \n\n1 Undated MS note in V&A departmental file.\n2 Personal communication, 1992. \n3 BAC; repro.
