The ticket was issued by the auctioneer Phillips and was valid for up to three people.\n\nHistorical Associations\nThe sale was one of the largest and most-talked about events of the year. It lasted nearly two months and comprised over 2,000 lots and 20,000 books.\n\nThere was enormous interest in the sale, as the fabulous nature of  Fonthill Abbey's contents had been the subject of much speculation and curiosity. Until the public viewing prior to the aborted sale of 1822, Fonthill Abbey had not been open to viewing by the public, as had many other country houses at the time.\n\nSubject Depicted\nThe central image on the ticket is Fonthill Abbey. This building was created in the Gothic Revival style for the famous author, designer and collector William Beckford. The design of the ticket reflects the style of the building itself.",
