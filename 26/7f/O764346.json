It is richly decorated with open-work traceried panels with a central medallion containing the Sacred Monogram with rays (very similar to the centre of the standing paten), at each side a double rose amid sprays and above it, within a trefoil, a tiny shield bearing St. George's Cross. The base rises to nodding ogee arches behind which rises the octagonal open work stem. The stem swells into a wide band covered with complicated tracery, crockets and pinnacles. From behind this band, rises the octagonal open-work stem which now has flying buttresses which carry tiny figures. Above is a panelled stringcourse the open-work octagonal stem continues, now much thinner with attached shafts. The attached shafts terminate in ogee arches behind which the open-work octagonal stem rises to the foliage under-side of the crested edged grease pan in which stands a plain pricket.",
