            "public_access_description": "Play mas is a Trinidadian phrase meaning carnival, and putting on the carnival costume involves 'enacting' that costume.  Carnival derives from the elaborate masquerades thrown by French plantation owners from the 1780s; their African slaves held their own celebrations embracing ritual and folklore, but aping the behaviour of their masters.  After the abolition of slavery, carnival took to the streets. Mustapha Matura's play, tracing the rise to power of a tailor's apprentice, is a political comedy, set at carnival-time during the Independence celebrations.  It examines the effects of Trinidadian independence, the importance of carnival in Caribbean culture and how it can be appropriated by the state. Designer Peter Minshall is one of the most important contemporary designers of Carnival costumes and bands, using the form to comment on general or social conditions.  While his designs for Play Mas captured the riotous extravagance of carnival, they also posed the question, if carnival and playing mas can change the character of the wearer, then what effect would such a costume have on whoever chooses it?    \nThe cloak uses a mix of lurex fabrics, decorated with a wild selection of objects such as might be used in carnival costumes - from bottle tops to budgerigar mirrors - anything that will catch the light and make the costume alive.",
