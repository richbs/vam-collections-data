Although it was initally designed as a one-off piece in sprung steel, it was soon mass-produced in injection-molded PVC by the Italian manufacturer Kartell. It has since become one of Ron Arad's best-selling works. The design of the bookshelf allows users to individually adapt the shape of the final piece. When hung on a wall the curved shape of the 'Bookworm' can be manipulated by changing the position of the brackets.",

            "history_note": "In 1993 Ron Arad designed two bookshelves in sprung steel; \u2018This Mortal Coil\u2019 (W.18-1993) and \u2018Bookworm\u2019. These were presented at the Milan Furniture Fair of that year. Whereas \u2018This Mortal Coil\u2019 was free-standing, \u2018Bookworm' was wall-mounted. In 1995 Kartell began to produce \u2018Bookworm\u2019 in injection-moulded PVC.\n\nBookworm signified the beginning of a successful relationship between Ron Arad and Kartell, with Arad going onto design a number of futher products for Kartell, such as the \u2018Lovely Rita\u2019 bookshelf and the \u2018FPE\u2019 chair.\n\nThe shelf is available in three lengths (3.2m, 5.2m and 8.2m) and five colours (tea yellow, bottle green, cobalt blue, wine red, opaline) and is still in production today. \n\n\u2018Although it began as another challenging, one-off piece, the Bookworm has become Arad\u2019s best-selling design. Arad conceived the Bookworm in sprung steel, to make it both sculptural and functional, although in this form it was unreasonably demanding both to make and install, as well as quite expensive. Kartell took on the design and produced it in colourful, translucent, injection-molded PVC, thus making it accessible and attractive. The modular shelves could be tailored, like Arad\u2019s early Kee Klamp constructions, to suit individual and spatial requirments, through countless ways of linking its three, five and eight-meter segments.\u2019 Paola Antonelli, <i>Ron Arad: No Discipline</i> (New York:The Museum of Modern Art, 2009), p. 62.\n\nRon Arad was born in 1951 in Tel Aviv. He studied at the Jerusalem Academy of Art between 1971 and 1973. In 1973 he moved to London where he studied at the Architectural Association. Arad went on to establish One Off Design Studio with Caroline Thorman in 1981.",
