He is normally portrayed in the wilderness, kneeling before a cross, his hand in a stone with which he penitentially beats his chest. On the present bowl the saint is portraited as a scholar in his study, with his lion companion; a popular iconography  in Renaissance painting. The figure of the saint derives from a woodcut from the 'Biblia Italica', an illlustrated Italian translation of the Bible, first published in 1490 by Lucantonio Giunta in Venice (called the 'Malermi Bible' after its translator).\n\nThe type of ornament on the border, with trophies and putti painted with strong colours on a dark blue ground, relates the plate to a famous bowl in the Lehhman Collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, signed as made in 1508 in Castel Durante, in the Duchy of Urbino, by the potter 'Zoan Maria' (a form of the name Giovanni Maria). Although close in style, the painting of the present bowl, does not match the quality of the Lehman bowl and it can be attributed to a painter  close to Giovanni Maria.",
