These were arranged typologically (when persons or events in the Old Testament are paired symbolically with ones in the New Testament), one above the other. Donor panels were placed below, and panels depicting prophets above.\n\nThe Christian church has always believed that God spoke through his prophets. They were seen as the deliverers of God\u2019s messages concerning the future, including the Coming of the Messiah. In the medieval period Moses was included among them. Prophet panels are also known as \u2018messenger panels\u2019, because they convey divinely inspired prophecies or messages.\n\nWhen Francis Egerton began to install this glass in the windows of his chapel at Ashridge Park in Hertfordshire, he realised that the scheme was incomplete and that some of the original prophet panels were missing. He commissioned the stained-glass artist Joseph Hale Miller to make replacements.",

So they were thought of as the deliverers of His messages concerning the future including the Coming of the Messiah. In the medieval period Moses was included amongst the prophets.\n\nWhen Francis Egerton began to install this glass in the windows of his chapel at Ashridge Park in Hertfordshire, he realised that the scheme was incomplete and that some of the original prophet panels were missing.\n\nHe commissioned the stained glass artist, Joseph Hale Miller, to make replacements for these missing panels.",
