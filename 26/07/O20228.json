This fabric might have been used for curtains or upholstery. In this period it was particularly fashionable for the different furnishings used in a room, including window curtains and upholstery fabric, to match or complement each other.\n\nPlaces\nMost of the leading printworks in the London area had closed down by the beginning of the 19th century, and the centre of the textiles printing industry had shifted to Lancashire, and to Carlisle in Cumbria. This example is very close to original designs printed at the Bannister Hall works for Bateman & Todd, a leading firm of Manchester merchants,  and it may have been commissioned by them from another printer.\n\nDesign & Designing\nPillar prints, the name given to printed cottons with designs of flower-twined pillars, were an English speciality. They were first popular in the 1790s, and recurred at intervals and in different styles until the 1830s. This example has been discharge-printed: by 'discharging', or removing, areas of colour, a white pattern has been created on a dark ground.",
