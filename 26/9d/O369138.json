On the back of the vertical 'wall' supporting plank are cut vertical bands which probably fitted over nogging fixed on the structural walls. Note that the 1926 V&A configuration of cornice and carving appears to place the cornice too high relative to the carving (as seen in pre-1914 photographs, which show the upper part of the shield in front of the cornice). The modern waterleaf above bead and reel appears to approximate to the moulding visible in pre-1914 photographs.",

(1/6/1926) records: \n\"This is a most generous proposal to present to the Museum two examples of woodcarving by the school of Grinling Gibbons, removed from Cassiobury Park, Hertfordshire. I saw the carvings more than once in their original position and they are certainly of historic importance. They were removed and sold a few years ago and the remains of them are now in the hands of Mr. Edwards of Regent Street and Robertsons of Knightsbridge. Mr. Clifford Smith and I have been to see the carvings at both places and finally selected two examples coming within the figure of \u00a3400 which Mr. Lloyd has proposed to spend. The carvings of the house were originally sold for a very large sum and the most important examples are still priced at about \u00a3800. We have no doubt that the overmantel and frame are the best examples that can be obtained for the money at our disposal.\n\nThe overmantel which we have selected, as it was shewn to us, seemed to me to be incomplete and unsatisfactory without the cornice moulding. Mr. Edwards, of Regent Street, has kindly offered to add a section of moulding after it has been pickled, and I think we should write and thank him as well as Mr. Lloyd.\"",
