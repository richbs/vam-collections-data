The fabric is woven from the fibres of the thread banana plant. This cloth, known as \u2018bash\u00f4fu\u2019, was worn by all sections of Ry\u00fbky\u00fban society, although the simple, striped pattern of this garment suggests it belonged to a commoner. The Ry\u00fbky\u00fba Islands were an independent kingdom until 1879, when they were annexed by Japan. This robe has sleeves similar to a Japanese kimono, which indicates that it was made after 1879.",
