Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. Above all they had to have the means of attaching the cord. In this example, there are a pair of holes (himotoshi) on the bottom of the sandal.  Although netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated is the katabori (shape carving). This is a three- dimensional carving, such as this netsuke. \nFrom the 18th century onwards, many more makers signed their netsukes. This example is signed Ikkosai Toun. This netsuke contains many figures each very finely detailed. The figures appearance, in both their clothing and sad facial expressions, is reflective of their low social status. The making of mochi was a difficult process primarily through the steaming of glutinous rice and followed by its pounding in a large mortar.",
