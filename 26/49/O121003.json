The brass clock dial with applied copper chapter ring on the top surface is a later alteration from around 1700. The flat iron sides are lightly engraved and damascened with strapwork. \n\nThe movement of the clock is mounted between two iron plates 175mm square finely engraved with strapwork on both surfaces. The movement has been extensively altered but still contains: the going train with engraved brass barrel, fusee and chain; the striking train with engraved brass barrel and 'nag's head' release; the alarm train with plain brass resting barrel and single-end bell hammer whose tail engages with a ratchet-toothed wheel.\n\nInside there are 3 brass dials no longer with any mechanisms attached: a ring with the zodiac signs; a ring marked 1 to 12; a disc numbered 1 to 7 with weekday symbols marked 'DIES PLANETARVM'.\n\nThe removable bottom cover is of brass engraved with intertwined foliage and has four large engraved circular dials and one small one:\n\nTop left: 'CIRCLVS EPACTA' with an inner ring of years from 1567 to 1585 and with an outer ring giving the epact (the number of days the solar year exceeds the lunar year of 12 months) and a hand-set rotating dial marked 'EPACTA'\n\nTop right: A horizontal sundial showing hours a.m. and p.m. and the Italian hours. A compass box, now with needle missing, is mounted over part of this dial. The box has a removable engraved lid.\n\nBottom left: a series of concentric rings showing the Dominical letters (denoting the dates of Sundays) including Advent Sunday for  a 28-year solar cycle for the years 1560 to 1587 marked 'CIRCVLS SOLARIUS', and with a hand-set rotating arm marked 'ADVENTVS DOM'.\n\nBottom right:  Rings giving the 'golden numbers' (used to calculate the date of Easter) and corresponding dates for Easter Day for a cycle of 19 years from 1558 to 1576 marked 'AVREVS NVMERVS' and with a hand-set rotating arm marked 'PASCHA'.\n\nCentre: A small ring for the cycle of the Indiction, a measurable period of time on the ecclesiastical calendar, with 1558 opposite year 1, and with a hand-set rotating arm marked 'INDICTIO'",

With its finely engraved dials and intricately decorated casing, this clock was not simply a functional household item but a treasury piece, prized primarily for its craftsmanship and technical ingenuity.\n\nShallow, horizontal clocks resting on small feet such as this were made in Europe from the middle of the fifteenth century until the eighteenth century and came in a variety of shapes including square, hexagonal, octagonal and drum shaped. In fact so important were such clocks to the repertoire of the clockmaker in cities like Augsburg, Nuremberg and Ulm, that apprentices were given eight months to make an elaborate horizontal clock to demonstrate their fitness to practise. Many South German examples incorporated astronomical, astrological and calendar information in their dials.\n\nJacob Marquart was the son of Benedikt Marquart who for fifty years was Augsburg's town clockmaker. Both men spent time working in Italy and France and this clock was probably made for one of Jacob's wealthy clients in Italy. The dials display the Italian hours: timekeeping varied from country to country during the sixteenth century and in Italy the hours began at sunset.\n\nBy the 1550s it was fashionable for wealthy gentlemen to have a sound understanding of all branches of learning, from art and literature to mathematics and the natural sciences. Clocks such as this were housed alongside automatons and scientific instruments such as astrolabes and sundials in Scientifica, collections celebrating human ability to control nature. Jacob Marquart's clients included the Emperoro Maximilian II for whom he is recorded in 1569 as working on a complicated clock likely to take two years to complete.",
