The damage has been skilfully repaired by Mr. van Harskamp of the Maritime Museum at Rotterdam, but this has necessitated the laying down of the paper on card, so that the inscriptions on the back can no longer be seen. Holmes, p. 250, plausibly suggests that the scene is at Hampstead; the view into the valley on the right and the red house almost hidden by the trees are certainly features in common with the scenes known to be of Hampstead, such as No. 360 [175-1888]. Constable's correspondence with Leslie in this year shows that he spent much of September at Hampstead.\"",
