The shawm is a reeded woodwind instrument and is the predecessor of the modern oboe. Many scenes, in stained glass and in other media, survive from the Middle Ages which depict figures playing musical instruments. Angels are often depicted with instruments and these could represent a heavenly orchestra. \n\nThis fragment is part of a panel which is composed of many different stained glass fragments. These fragments were originally from a variety of panels made in England and in the Netherlands from the late 15th to the 16th centuries. They were part of the collection of Walter Guthrie. Collectors of stained glass in the 19th and early 20th centuries would often glaze a variety of fragments together and then display them in the windows of their homes or galleries. These are known as 'composite panels'. The current arrangement of fragments in this composite panel was done after they entered the museum's collection.\n\nThese fragments are all clear glass with decoration composed of simple brown/black pigment and silver (yellow) stain. In the early part of the 14th century a new technique of decorating glass was developed. This consisted of painting a compound of silver on the back of the glass which, after firing in a kiln, turns yellow. Many panels from the 14th through to the 16th century are decorated simply in yellow (silver) stain and highlighted with a brown/black pigment.",
