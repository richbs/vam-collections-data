He is a printmaker of long standing, and his most recent work has focused on the integration of computer technology into fine art practice. His own work involves layering and integrating different techniques, using the computer to manipulate imagery, which is then printed using a mix of traditional and digital methods.\n\nThis print comes from a larger group of prints by the artist in the V&A collection representing key phases in his exploration of fine art printmaking. Border 1 (2002), an inkjet print, employs the grainy view of mountains he has used in several prints from this period. This belongs to a sequence of prints which explore the ambiguous meanings of mountains (as physical and political borders, sites of dispute and conflict between warring states, and destinations for tourism and leisure pursuits) and the various experiences and motivations that prompt travel to or from such regions. The flowers superimposed are equally ambiguous \u2013 given for love, but also to mark a death. The grainy image of the mountains is distancing: it denies the specificity of place, and references newspaper photographs. The flowers are presented in a sketchy decorative manner, and their fragility and ephemerality is emphasised. Background, foreground and surface are layered and rendered ambiguous.",
