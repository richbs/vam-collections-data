It is possible therefore that the other pages were disposed of. \nThe register notes that the volume was bought for \u00a325 in March 1880, with a note stating 'that it is one volume of three of the Koran, the other two not being in existence and that it was written for Shere           [space]     Emperor of Delhi' [Presumably Shere Shah]. \n\nThis volume came into the possession of a British officer at the fall of Delhi in 1857. He died on his voyage to England'\nThe register further notes that two of the end leaves were stamped with the seal marks of 'various librarians of the Court of Shah Jahan (1628-1651[sic]), and a long inscription on a fly-leaf gives information as to the provenance of the paper, and of certain repairs undertaken.'",
