International exhibitions played an important role in introducing imported styles of ornament. The design of this card echoes illuminated Persian manuscripts, which Jones included in his book Grammar of Ornament. \n\nApart from working as an architect, Jones also designed interiors, wallpapers and textiles. He created the interior for the Crystal Palace in Hyde Park, which housed the Great Exhibition of 1851.",
