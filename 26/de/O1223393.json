Deborah Thomas had been using halogen lights from 1987 (for example in 'Blue Flame', 1987, and 'Frozen Branch', 1988), and although the chandelier was conceived to be lit by halogens, it was made on spec for the Gallery, at a time when it was difficult for her to bear the expense of halogens. She intended to offer the eventual purchaser the option of halogen lights, although when the chandelier was sold the purchaser was happy with the single light bulb.\n \nThemes & Variations brought the chandelier back from the client in 2007. While at the gallery in 2010, the chandelier was cleaned by hand, after which it was inspected and sections were strengthened by Deborah Thomas who also instructed the electrician on the re-lighting of the chandelier with halogens as originally intended.\n\nIn January 2011, immediately prior to its acquisition, Deborah Thomas carried out some minor repairs to the chandelier at the Museum. This entailed replacing a small number of  broken or missing glass shards that had become damaged or dislodged at the foot of the chandelier, in order to correct its overall shape.\n\nHistorical significance: The \u2018Northern Fleet\u2019 Chandelier is a spectacular example of an important trend in British design in the 1980s of reusing and recycling materials to create modern, ethically responsible objects. \u2018Skip Culture\u2019, as it became known, was perhaps most famously embodied in the work of Ron Arad and of Creative Salvage \u2013 the collective of Tom Dixon, Mark Brazier Jones, Nick Jones and later Andre Dubreuil. As the Creative Salvage manifesto of 1983 stated, \u2018The key to Creative Salvage\u2019s success does not lie in the expensive research and development costs of modern day products. But in the recycling of scrap to form stylish and functional artefacts for home and office\u2019.       \n\nAlthough Deborah Thomas came from the discipline of Theatre Design she arrived at a similar aesthetic of re-use and economy of materials, particularly in her recycled glass chandeliers designed for a variety of settings including theatre productions, exhibitions, public spaces and private homes. In the second half of the 1980s Liliane Fawcett of Themes and Variations Gallery in Westbourne Grove presented the work of Deborah Thomas alongside that of Tom Dixon, Mark Brazier Jones, Andre Dubreuil and Ron Arad. The 'Northern Fleet' chandelier demonstrates a drama and sophistication in the handling of recycled material that is distinct from the work of these other designers.",
