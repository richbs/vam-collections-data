He was billed as \u2018The original singer of Hello! Hello!\u2019. It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre. He compiled them in a series of albums.\n\nBorn near Manchester in 1876, Cunliffe was a singer and dandy in the Victorian music hall tradition of immaculately dressed stars who sang slightly risqu\u00e9 songs about love and courtship. Cunliffe\u2019s favourite songs included \u2018I Do Like To Be Beside The Seaside\u2019, its companion-piece \u2018There\u2019s Something in the Seaside Air\u2019, and \u2018Who Were You With Last Night?\u2019. His songs often contained questions such as \u2018Now, Are We All Here?\u2019, to which the audience shouted \u2018Yes!\u2019 and joined in the choruses. He was well known for strutting around the stage in a brown suit and straw boater, or in dandified outfits such as a mauve frock-coat. At Hanley he sang three songs, finishing with \u2018Hello! Hello! Hello!\u2019. He was praised for his lack of \u2018meretricious make-up\u2019, and being \u2018a walking advertisement for the tailor who cut his dapper frock-coat, and the hatter who irons his immaculate \u201ctopper\u201d\u2019 He died in 1966.",

Sometimes he was a straw-hatted symphony in brown as he walked about the stage in a figure eight, and told us that \"There's Something in the Seaside Air.\" It was a companion piece to \"I Do Like to be Beside the Seaside.\" There must be something in it, insisted Whit Cunliffe, because it made you do the things you always do there and his listeners. with memories of seaside evenings spent walking round the bandstand to the glitter of fairy lamps, with the sound of the sea mingling with the music in their ears. \"clicking\" and \"getting off\" with the girls, could not have agreed more. In a mauve frock coat and other garments to match he demanded \"Who Were You With Last Night?\" His male audience responded (for most men like to be imagined \"dogs\") and the female element surrendered to the compliment to their charms. \"Were they going to tell their missus when they got home?\" he asked. Most emphatically they were not and well he knew it, there was perfect understanding between singer and front of the house. His songs often contained a question and one of the most popular was \"Now, Are We All Here?\" That was all right, if they were all there they all shouted \"Yes! \" and then sang the whole chorus as well. Whit Cunliffe and Charles Whittle were indeed great singers of great songs and the epitome of what made Music Hall.'\n'Stars Who Made the Halls' by S. Theodore Felstead\n'Whit Cunliffe in his brown suit and silk hat was almost equally good.  I used to like:\n    \"Mr. Cupid, Mr. Cupid, he's the cause of all the trouble,\n           The cause of all the strife,\n      When the trousers and the skirt get together, it's a cert,\n     It's a case for Mr Cupid every time.\" '\n<i>The Performer</i>, 21 June 1906, advertisement of engagement.\nJune 18, GRAND, HANLEY\nC.B.

He dressed impeccably, often in his trademark brown suit and silk hat, and was one of the leading music hall performers, or 'top-liners' until 1914. The caricature comes from the second album of caricatures in a collection of albums owned by the Theatre Museum compiled by the graphic artist George Cooke. It is labelled by the artist 'Geo Cooke HYS BOOKE' and features music hall performers working in the early 20th century.",
