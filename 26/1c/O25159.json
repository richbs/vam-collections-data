After the First World War the demand for such furniture was hugely increased by the building boom in 'Tudor' half-timbered suburban houses, resulting in the designing of reproduction pieces like this sideboard. It is loosely adapted from the design of a late-medieval chest, its historicising style being emphasised (as if it were needed) by the figure of the knight in armour. The London firm of R. B. Simpson & Co., who designed carpets as well as furniture, were capable of turning out ideas for pieces in a wide range of style, from historicist to Moderne.\n[Michael Snodin, 'British Design at Home', p.109]",
