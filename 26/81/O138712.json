Tiny lozenges flavoured with roses, violets, liquorice, mint or cloves would freshen the breath, calm a cough or settle a stomach. The boxes were inspired by porcelain versions from Meissen, Chelsea and the French soft-paste factories but the huge variety of novelty designs for enamelled bonbonni\u00e8res was the result of the competitive imaginations of their West Midlands makers. \n\nBonbonni\u00e8res in the form of human heads were made in a wide variety of designs and styles. This box is in the form of a 'blackamoor's' head. In the 16th century the image of a black man's head in profile \u2013 often crowned or wearing a white band \u2013 was an important element of European heraldry. Later it appeared in decorative art, particularly in 'Moretto' earrings produced in Venice. Made in the form of a black head or bust in the round wearing a white turban and earrings (of gold or pearl), these luxury items mixed representations of black Africans with 'orientalising' accessories. Curiously, these stereotyped images often appeared in places with historic maritime trade links with North Africa, such as Venice and Rijeka (Croatia). This box is a later British addition to the genre.",
