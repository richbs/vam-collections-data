The artist grew up in Pakistan in the 1970s during President Zia's oppressive rule and her work like many of that generation explores the placement of women in that society. Her female figures are depicted as headless torsos to highlight the imposed perception of women in Pakistan and their non-recognition as individuals. The circle is a recurring symbol in her work which she uses as a means of conveying the constrained lives of human beings. Circles also indicate the hallowed space of various rituals as well as the sun and moon. In this print we see several headless figures conjoined at the waste emerging from a semi-circle. The print is typical of the artist's grotesque work.",
