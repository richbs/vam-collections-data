From 1917 to 1925 he was a member of the Royal Navy, and while sailing on the Round the World Empire Cruise of the Special Service Squadron made a set of water-colour drawings, now in the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich.  From 1926 he worked for the London and North Easter railway, rejoined the Royal Navy during the Second World War and in 1946 returned to the Architect's Department at Kings Cross Station, London.

In the years between 1909 and 1913 he made copies from working drawings of church plate designed by G. F. Bodley, William Burges, J. L. Pearson, G. E. Street and others.  He received a Regent Street Polytechnic medal for building construction, and a bronze medal for metal casting from the Founders' Company in 1910.  From 1917 to 1925 he was a member of the Royal Navy, and while sailing on the Round the World Empire Cruise of the Special Service Squadron made a set of water-colour drawings, now in the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich.  From 1926 he worked for the London and North Easter railway, rejoined the Royal Navy during the Second World War and in 1946 returned to the Architect's Department at Kings Cross Station, London.",
