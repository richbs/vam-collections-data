            "public_access_description": "Silk and satin theatre playbills and programmes were produced from the 18th century onwards to commemorate special evenings at the theatre. Most theatres and some circuses in the 19th century had some made to mark grand openings or milestone performances. By the end of the First World War however the practice had generally died out, only being revived very occasionally, more often at London's opera houses than any other theatres.\n\nHarmston's Circus opened in Madras on Saturday December 13th 1905, having sailed from Rangoon on 7th December. They stayed until 6th January 1906 when they left for Bombay. This programme was produced as a souvenir of the performance of Harmston's Circus in Madras on 26th December because of the presence of Lord & Lady Ampthill. Lord Ampthill was Governor of Madras from 1901 to 1906. \n\nHarmston's Circus was founded by the Nottingham-born equestrian William Batty Harmston (1844-1893). After working with Chiarini's circus in India in 1887, he formed his own circus which toured Australia 1890-1891. After his death in Singapore, his widow carried on the circus with the manager Robert Love, who she married and whose surname can be seen on this programme added to her name and that of her children.",
