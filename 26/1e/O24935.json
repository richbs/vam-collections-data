Letter dated 29/12/1930 in which an evaluation by Spink is given of the piece (60 pounds) who assigns the piece to the '4th century Empire of Kushan'. Fleming is willing to accept 30 pounds. Codrington recognises the piece as Jain, Kushan, possibly coming from Kankali Tila and dates it to the 2nd century AD. He recommends the purchase on the ground that 'Kushan prices continue to increase and Leicester Galleries have recently asked 300 pounds for a Kushan head'.
