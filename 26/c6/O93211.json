            "history_note": "Johann Jebenz was born in 1661, the son of a goldsmith.  He got into frequent trouble with the authorities for repeatedly working sub-standard silver.  In 1708 he made a spoon and forged the town mark, the spoon was confiscated and Jebenz thrown in prison and fined.  After this he was in Stuttgart and Ulm and on his return to Augsburg was arrested once more.  In 1711 the only permission he had to work, was not as a master but as an apprentice.  This piece has seen a lot of wear.\nPurchase - (\u00a330) from Fitzhenry collection under Captain H B Murray Bequest. Ex Loan 2847. Neg no.: je 2989",
