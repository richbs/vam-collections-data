The series was first published in book form in 1999 to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the first human landing on the moon on 20 July 1969. By scanning NASA negatives and applying digital imaging technology, Light has created the sharpest images of space ever seen. Not only are the photographs interesting from a scientific point of view, they also reveal an \u2018aesthetics of space\u2019, creating what Light describes as \u2018the ultimate landscape photography\u2019.\n\nThis image is a composite of a number of individual images. It shows the lunar surface in incredible detail, with a large crater and moon debris. The moon buggy sitting on the rim of the crater gives an idea of scale.",
