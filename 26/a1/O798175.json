The ceiling of the Peers' Lobby was painted by the time the House of Lords was opened in April 1847. As executed, the idea of the central rose and circular wreaths contained in Pugin's sketch designs were slightly modified and the crowns were replaced by foliage. The ceiling has not been altered since. \n\nAugustus Welby Northmore Pugin (1812-52) is widely considered as one of the most significant and influential architects, designers and theorists of the 19th century. Following his conversion to Catholicism in 1835, he identified the Gothic style with Christian architecture and his work and writings inspired and framed the Gothic Revival. In 'Contrasts', published in 1836, he condemned classical forms and ardently praised 14th and 15th-century architecture. Pugin is best remembered for his work on the Palace of Westminster.",
