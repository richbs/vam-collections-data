With a stylised floral pattern of red flowers and green foliage on a gold ground, and enclosed within borders of alternating red squares and green rectangles. Edged with silk braid. Lining of kincob woven in brightly coloured silks and silver gilt thread. High projecting pommel.\n\nThe cloth is wider in the front than behind. In the middle of the forward edge is a circular opening which encircles the pommel. The velvet appliqu\u00e9 pattern is formed by a diaper of compartments outlined by vertical undulating leafy stems. Each compartment encloses one of three flowers, repeated consecutively in the horizontal rows, or alternately in the diagonal rows. In the middle of the field and at each corner is a lobed panel containing a symmetrical floral spray. Round all the sides of the cloth and round the pommel opening is a wide border of wavy stems bearing floral forms. The ground of gold is worked to give the effect of ribbing. The design of the kincob lining is the same in scheme as that of the front, but the flowers filling the foliate trellis of green are all the same and are carried out in forget-me-not blue, salmon pink and green, as are the flowers of the undulating border. The ground is of laid gold thread. The tablet-woven binding braid has a chevron motive in gold.",
