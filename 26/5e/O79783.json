The plaque is roughly triangular in shape with a flat base and a top in the form of a fleur de lys.  It is decorated on the front with applied filigree motifs, some containing traces of green cloisonn\u00e9 enamel, and four striated corals in closed mounts.  There is an Arabic inscription across the centre.  There are five loops along the lower edge and a hole at the tip of each of the three points of the triangle.  A pendant hangs from the hole on the extreme right.  This consists of a filigree bead with a curved rosette, divided into eight lobes, at its base.  There is a loop-in-loop chain hanging from each lobe of the rosette, with a pierced disc at its top, a larger perforated disc at its end, and a wire holding two red glass beads in its centre.  Each of the discs also originally contained a red glass bead, but many of these are now missing.  The whole pendant is attached to the main plaque by a short length of three loop-in-loop chains side by side, separated by two rings.",
