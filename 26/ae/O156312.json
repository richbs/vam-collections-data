Tobias Baur was one of Augsburg\u2019s leading makers of travelling toilet services during the seventeenth century and many of his services survive: the largest of which contains ninety-one pieces and is in the Residenzmuseum, Munich. This service was probably to be placed into a fitted drawer in a cabinet. When travelling, it would be transported in its original case.  Many of the pieces are decorated with enamel miniatures of putti in landscapes. Although unsigned it is believed that these enamelled miniatures were supplied by the Fromery workshop in Berlin.\n\nThe 18th century saw an emerging class of rich citizens who used their acquired wealth to indulge a passion for beautiful objects. The Renaissance tradition of the treasury or Shatzkammer, a special room for displaying exotic artefacts, continued in the 18th and 19th centuries. Other types of display included presentation plate, often of solid gold, which in the 18th century was worth about twenty times the value of silver.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world\u2019s great decorative art collections, including silver,  mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
