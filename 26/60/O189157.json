The commission to manufacture this card came to them through the Federation of High Frequency Welders, of whom John Cox, owner of N.A.P. is a member. A strong \"environmental\" lobby at the time in favour of disposable or bio-degradable plastics led to most members of the Federation being against production. John Cox was the only member who welcomed the idea and was prepared to take it on, seeing this invitation card as an art work in itself which recipients would probably like to keep anyway. The card was made from a 'zinco' or printing plate, specially made and used for welding the two sheets together and a specially cut dye to cut the shape. The welding was done not by a traditional heat treatment but by high frequency welding similar in principle to microwave heating.",
