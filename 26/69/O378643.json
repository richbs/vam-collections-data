A short letter by 'J.S.' on the successful capture of the ships published in the August 1745 issue of <u>The Gentleman's Magazine</u> explains that 'these ships went out four years ago to Peru and Chili, and had on board [...] one million sterling in gold and silver coin, besides 800 tons of cocoa, and we are every day discovering more treasure that has been concealed' (pp. 428-9). The V&amp;A cup is not the only piece to survive from the haul. In 2000, a silver-gilt basin with a similar inscription was auctioned at Christie's, London (sale 6354, lot 21). The English did not manage to capture all the treasure, however.  'J.S.' recalls that there were numerous friars aboard the ships, 'one of whom threw a gold chalice into the sea of great value that it should not come into our hands' (p. 429).",
