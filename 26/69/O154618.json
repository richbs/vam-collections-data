When he was commissioned to design King Lear for the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre Company in 1955, he had little experience of costume.  \n\nThe style that Noguchi chose to present his ideas is unusual. Instead of the usual 2-D figure on paper, he produced little paper dolls, with layers of costumes that could be removed; fixed to each figure was a wire strut so that it could stand upright.  \n\nThis design, for John Gielgud as King Lear in the later scenes, has been fixed to a sheet of paper and annotated.  Each one had a typrwritten wardrobe reference - in this case \"Lear.  flesh basic & white cloak.  flower headdress\"   the annotations are Gielgud's comments and reservations about the costume - a rare case where an actor's reactions are recorded.  Obviously, Gielgud did not relish playing Lear's last scenes in flesh-coloured body tights and body bands, and has requested a more dignified kimono dressing gown.",

The play was directed by George Devine, with John Gielgud as Lear. The production opened in Brighton on 6 June, then visited festivals in Vienna, Zurich, The Hague, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Berlin and Copenhagen, before playing at London's Palace Theatre, 21 July to 17 September. It then went to Hanover, Bremen, Hamburg, Oslo, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool, and finally came to the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre at Stratford-upon-Avon, 29 November to 17 December.\n\nThe costumes were made by Carl Bonn and Colin Mackenzie.\n\nHistorical significance: This is a most unusual way of presenting a costume design and there is nothing else quite like it in the Museum collections.",
