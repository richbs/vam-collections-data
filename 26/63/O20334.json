Christopher Dresser's commitment to practicality led him to include a dip to help in scooping up the last spoonful in the soup plates accompanying this vegetable dish.  The plates of this service have indents in the rims for condiments.  The vegetable dish is of a strongly geometric form, typical of Dresser's style.\n\nPeople\nDresser, a trained botanist, was perhaps the most radical and prolific of 19th-century designers.  Often described as a 'pioneer of modern design', he promoted quality, machine production and new materials; his interest in and commitment to commercial design meant that he actively sought opportunities to design for inexpensive mass production.\n\nDesign & Designing\nDresser's designs for Old Hall Earthenware Co. were first registered in 1884.  This service was registered in 1886.  Although given the name 'Shanghai', the pattern has no connection at all with Chinese ornament or the Far East.  This complete irrelevance of name to pattern is common in Victorian ceramics.  The same shape was also produced decorated with other patterns called 'Persian' and 'Hampden'.",
