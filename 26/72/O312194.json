These objects, produced in quantities, were usually found in these scholars's studios, where they kept functional objects and collectibles. \nThese plaquettes could have an ornamental purpose. As such, they are often incomplete in themselves, as they would be applied or mounted on items of household furniture, such as inkstands, lamps or caskets.  They could also sometimes be used as items of personal adornment, to decorate clothing or accessories (see Hill, 1917, p. 104, Spencer, 1969, pp. 5-7).  \nAs small objects easily transportable, plaquettes were also used by artists as means of transmitting themes, compositions, and their interpretations of antique and religious subjects (Spencer, 1969, p. 7). They bore and intrinsic value as collectibles, since they appear in 16th century inventories (Spencer, 1969, p. 7)\nReligious plaquettes could also have a ceremonial purpose, and be mounted as a pax, or small flat tablet that worshipers kiss when offered the 'kiss of peace', a greeting given at religious services, as an indication of Christian love. Pope-Hennessy (1965, p. 87) notes one such example of this plaquette in the Museum at Pienza, and the Metalwork section of the V&A keeps one similarly mounted, and decorated with niello plaques (museum no. 4408-1857).",
