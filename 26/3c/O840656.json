            "history_note": "Historical significance: The <I>Via Crucis</I> consists of title page, dedication, and 14 plates showing the Stations of the Cross. These are based on a series of paintings by Domenico Tiepolo in the Oratorio del Crucifies (Oratory of the Crucifix) in the Church of S. Polo, Venice. The artist completed the painting in 1747. Plate IX from the series of prints is dated 1748. The title page bears the date 1749, implying that the project was finished in this year. The canvases of the Stations of the Cross are amongst the earliest works by Domenico Tiepolo. They are close in style and composition to paintings by his father, the celebrated artist Giambattista Tiepolo, with whom he had trained and continued to work throughout his life. The fact that prints were made  soon after completion of the canvases, demonstrates the potential it was felt they had for reproduction. The fourteen scenes of the stations of the cross are presented following the Venetian tradition for this subject. Such prints would have been a popular series of devotional images. They were produced in six states. The series in the V&A collection (inventory numbers: E.1287-1907 to E.1301-1907) are second states of the series,  recognised by the inscription <I>In Venezia</I> written at the bottom of the title page.\n\nThis title page is the first page in the series of prints from the <I>Via Crucis</I>. In the foreground the extreme foreshortening of the cross directs our eye back into the landscape, where we see two crosses on a hillside. The title of the series is represented as if sculpted into what appears to be a classical tombon the left. Various reference to the Crucifixion, such as the cockerel crowing and the ladder, are included in the composition. Below the image, the print is inscribed with the name of Domenico Tiepolo, place of production and date of 1749 in Roman numerals.",
