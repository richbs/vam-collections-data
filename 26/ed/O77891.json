The waved edge, elaborate enamelled decoration and lavish use of gilding are all characteristic of dessert wares of this date. This service comprised 44 pieces, and was supplied to Philip Egerton, a Cheshire landowner, in 1773.\n\nTrading\nThe bill for the dessert service indicates that Egerton bought it direct from the Derby porcelain factory site for \u00a333 8s and that the dessert plates cost 13s each. (In the mid-18th century shopkeepers and skilled craftsmen might earn around \u00a31 a week.) Egerton paid his bill seven months after the last item was delivered. This was not unusual, and manufacturers often had to extend credit to private customers for longer periods than this. The Derby factory aimed at the top end of the market and sold most of its wares from factory showrooms in Covent Garden, London. These were handsomely fitted out, and sales were not confined to dealers, but were directed to private customers as well. The term 'warehouse' was used for both exclusive showrooms and warehouses of the modern sort, which stocked large quantities of goods and sold wholesale.",
