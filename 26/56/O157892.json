The combination of exotic materials and the form itself reflect the taste of the era. Mounted ostrich egg and stems in the shape of a tree trunk can be found repeatedly on cups made in South German centres of production around 1600.\n\nThe cup would have been an eloquent means of demonstrating the owner's taste, wealth and status. Ostrich egg cups are a tradition dating back to the Middle Ages. Healing powers were ascribed to the material which makes it very likely that the cup was not only part of the owner's chamber of treasures or Schatzkammer, but might also have been used as a drinking vessel.\n\nIn the case of this cup the form assumes a rather extravagant quality by the transformation of the straps into red flames. This unique choice is an allusion to the crest of arms of a Swiss patrician family, the Graffenrieds of Bern. The family held several important offices in the 17th century.\n\nThe Rosalinde and Arthur Gilbert Schatzkammer is one of the few collections of its kind formed in the late 20th century.  \n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
