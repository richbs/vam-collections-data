When not being worn, it rests here beneath a square of polished rock crystal. The centrepiece was commissioned as a testimonial for presentation to L. G. Northcroft, the retiring chairman of the Cheltenham-based engineering firm Spirax-Sarco. The gold is extremely pure, which gives it a softness exploited in the crumpled texture of the metal. This was a very fashionable surface treatment in the mid-1960s.\n\nLouis Osman, born in 1914, was one of the major English silversmiths of the immediate post-war generation. In 1969 he designed and made the coronet worn by Prince Charles at his investiture as Prince of Wales.",

Osman regarded the jewelled brooch as being the focal point from which everything else in the design originated. From this point the shape of the bowl evolves, spreading outwards in ever increasing eccentric sweeps. The jewelled brooch normally sits on a velvet cushion beneath a rock crystal lens which is raised or lowered by a detachable key operating a worm gear mechanism. The design uses a modernist abstract language to symbolize the world-wide sweep of the company which Northcroft had done so much to establish and expand.",
