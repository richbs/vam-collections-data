The haloed and bearded Christ, wearing the torse and naked but for a loincloth, is in the centre of the panel on the cross, which has a stepped base set into the panel frame. His head is inclined to the left, and his right side is marked with a wound. On the left of the panel is the figure of the Virgin Mary, wearing a gown and a cloak. She is turned towards the centre, her hands clasped together. She stands on a shallow pedestal, set into the frame of the panel. St. John the Evangelist, wearing a gown and a cloak, stands on a simlar projection on the right, his right hand held against his head, his left supporting his elbow in a traditional gesture of sorrow. \n\nThe faces of all the figures are seriously damaged. The top right and the bottom corners of the panel are broken off, the edges of the panel are chipped and there is a crack, top right. The panel is scratched at random with initials. The surface is weathered. There are two holes drilled right through the panel on either side of the top of the cross, probably to suspend the panel for display at a later date. \n\nNo paint remains on the panel. The back of the panel bears none of the usual metal loops.",

The Crucifixion was frequently the subject of the central panel of Passion altarpieces, but this panel was probably from a tomb (or, less likely, a font) rather than from a retable. The absence of wire attachments on the back of the panel and its unusual thickness (7.5 cm) give support to this idea.",
