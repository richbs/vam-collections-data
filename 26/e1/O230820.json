            "bibliography": "G. Reynolds, <i>Victoria and Albert Museum: Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, 1973, pp. 37-39.\nThe following is the full text of a note on the entry:\n\n'Langham Church is to be seen on the crest of the ridge, left. A man, in the right foreground, is walking towards it along the Gun Hill road. The tower of Higham Church is just visible below the windmill, at the extreme right edge. For the history and provenance of this drawing and for further details of the topography see the note following No. 16C [...]\n\nNote: These are three of a set of four elaborate watercolour drawings which Constable made as a wedding present for his friend Lucy Hurlock when she married Thomas Blackburne at Dedham Church on 22 November 1800. Lucy Hurlock was the daughter of the Rev. Brooke Hurlock, rector of Lamarsh and curate of Langham, (Beckett, II, pp. 18-21). The four drawings descended in the family, and appear first to have been recorded by Martin Davies when they were the property of Miss Eva Ducat (letter of 27 November 1933 to B. S. Long in the Departmental archives). The set was sold by Miss Ducat at Messrs. Christie's on 6 July 1934 (Lot 4) dubiously attributed to Constable, and purchased by Walker's Galleries for 3 guineas. When placed on exhibition in Walker's Galleries in the 31st Annual Exhibition of Early English Watercolours, 1935 (Nos. 74-76) they were unattributed. The fourth drawing in the series, a view of the estuary at Harwich with the tower of Dedham Church prominent in the distance, was later acquired by the Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester, in 1943 as the work of the Swiss artist Michel Vincent Brandoin (1733-1790) (reproduced in Reynolds, <i>Constable the Natural Painter</i>, 1965, Pl. I). Nos. 16A [P.24-1970], 16B [P.26-1970] and 16C [P.27-1970] became the property of R. B. Beckett, from whom they were purchased by the Museum in 1970. (See also 'A Wedding Present from John Constable' by R. B. Beckett <i>Connoisseur</i>, June 1955, pp. 16-19.) Lt-Col. C. A. Brooks has supplied identifications of all the scenes, which are executed with exceptional attention to detail and accuracy. He has also shown that the three drawings in the Museum in the order 16A, 16B, 16C and the fourth, at Manchester, complete a panorama of the Stour Valley from west to east, and stretching from Langham Church to the estuary. Three of the scenes, Nos. 16A, 16B and the drawing in the Whitworth Institute, Manchester, are taken from the same view point on the hill immediately south of the Stratford St. Mary bridge. The fourth, 16C, is taken from a point slightly to the east and lower down, from a lane opposite the present Dedham Vale Hotel. The aim was evidently to provide Lucy Hurlock with a clear and comprehensive survey of the landscape familiar to her throughout her childhood. Lt.-Col. Brooks has pointed out that Constable again achieved a study of meticulous accuracy when he painted a later picture as a wedding present - the 'Stour Valley and Dedham Village' (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Mass.), made for Miss Philadelphia Godfrey in 1814. The quotation given in the entry for No. 279a shows that he later had second thoughts about a panoramic survey of \"a valley filled with imagery\".'\n\nG Reynolds",

(The date 1798 which has previously been accepted for this journey was derived from entries published under that year in the printed edition of Farington's <i>Diary</i> (Greig, Vol. I, p. 229); but they are dated 1799 in the original MS.) He entered the Academy Schools as a probationer in March 1799, and was enrolled as a student on 19 February 1800. In the summer of 1800 he stayed by himself sketching in Helmingham Park, the grounds of a seat of the Earl of Dysart.\n\n[G Reynolds]",
