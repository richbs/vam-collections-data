Many panels from the 14th and 15th centuries are decorated simply in yellow (silver) stain and highlighted with a brown-black pigment.\n\nThis pane of glass is composed of clear glass painted on the reverse with yellow stain and on the front with brown pigment. The thick coat of brown pigment was scratched through to reveal a stylised floral spray. This fragment is a small section of the border of a larger panel, probably showing the figure of a saint under a canopy. The sides of the panel would have contained small rectangular panes of glass that were painted and stained with decorative motifs as seen here.\n\nThe religious conflicts that affected the British Isles in the 16th and 17th centuries had a devastating effect upon the decorative arts and furnishings of the Christian church.

The sides of the panel would have contained small rectangular panes of glass which were painted and stained with similar decorative motifs as seen here.\n\nIn contrast to traditional stained glass, which was coloured with metallic oxides when in a molten state, this fragment was decorated using a new technique introduced in England in the early 14th century. This consisted of painting a compound of silver on the back of the glass. After firing in a kiln, the silver compound turns yellow. Many panels from the 14th and 15th centuries are decorated simply in yellow (silver) stain and highlighted with a brown/black pigment.",
