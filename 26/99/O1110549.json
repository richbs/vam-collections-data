The products were chiefly foodstuffs, but they included some industrial commodities too. The EMB was a major patron of graphic designers and film-makers. The design and content of the posters was self-consciously superior to those of advertisements. The EMB commissioned many well-known artists, including Edward Mcknight Kauffer and Gerald Spencer Pryse. Artists were asked to re-submit work that failed to display sufficient technical accuracy or which lapsed into fantasy. Clive Gardiner's strikingly modernist design was issued as part of a series of posters stressing the economic interdependence of Britain and its overseas Empire.",
