Only rarely, it seems, did he attempt religious subjects, as in four bronze reliefs with biblical subjects (three at Glynde place Sussex and one in the Art Institute of Chicago). This is his only known representation of the Crucifixion. The figure of Christ is loosely based on the Christo morto type of Giambologna, but as usual with Bertos, the iconography of the rest of the group is highly idiosyncratic. Although we know that Bertos was dealing with the Basilica of Saint Anthony at Padua in 1733, this group seems more likely to have been produced for a private patron than for a church.\n"
