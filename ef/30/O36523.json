            "physical_description": "1. boiler unit; brass which was originally painted black. The boiler is screwed to a retangular plate. Its bottom has a series of holes near the edge and a cut away panel which has been folded out to form a flap. The boiler, although appearing to be solid, is double skinned and is open\nthrough the centre from bottom to top ending at the top with a funnel. On the top is a value which unscrews to allow the boiler to be filled with water. Also on the top is a sealed pipe leading to the piston, the pipe is tightly wrapped to prevent heat loss. Attached to the base plate next to the boiler is the working mechanism operated by the piston. It is contained in a metal casing and consists of a flywheel turning a large cog. The flywheel and cog are each attached to grooved wheels (like pulley wheels) which rotate at different speeds. Around these wheels would be place string to link the model to be operated with the boiler.\n2. small value which screws into the top of the boiler \n3. spirit burner; metal drum with a small screw on lid on the top and a long tube attached to the side.  In the tube is a cotton wick. The burner would be filled with spirits and the wick lit. The tube with the wick slides through the flap and under the boiler across its centre while the drum remains on the outside. \n4. funnel; dark brown plastic marked BETTERWEAR FREE GIFT. This is used to fill both the water boiler and the spirit burner. It is not original; a replacement from the 1950s. \n\nTo operated, water is poured into the boiler through the small value at the top; it is heated, by the wick from the spirit burner. When boiling the steam travels down the sealed pipe to move the piston which in turn moves the flywheel and cog to turn the pulley wheels.",
