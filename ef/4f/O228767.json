Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. Above all, they had to have the means for attaching a cord. Netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated being the katabori (shape carving), a three-dimensional carving, such as this one in the form of a frog.\n\nBoth wood and ivory were traditionally the most widely used materials for making netsuke. This netsuke is carved from wood.  Since trees grow abundantly throughout Japan, wood is readily available and many varieties are comparatively cheap. There is also a long tradition of expertise in wood carving in Japan. Due to the small size of netsuke, however, it is usually not possible to identify the species by the grain and ring pattern of the wood.",
