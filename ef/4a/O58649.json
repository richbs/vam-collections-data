It is purfled and decorated with a squared knot-pattern at the lower end, where there is a scrolled wooden projection (the 'comb'), slotted to hold the strings. The underside of the belly has four strengthening bars arranged in an open square. The bridge and the rose are simple modern replacements. The sides, which taper from neck to base, are carved with overlapping rosettes within roundels. At the neck the sides end in carved outward-turned scrolls. \n\nThe neck, which is offset to the treble side of the instrument, carries a sycamore fingerboard with eighteen brass frets. The fingerboard extends on to the belly, with a cartouche at its end which does not appear to have been decorated with any armorial charges, though another cartouche, on the back next to the neck, has a cittern carved on the shield in relief and the initials 'A.C' painted on it. The head has a slightly domed surface into which the pegs are inserted from the front. The finial is a small open bifurcated scroll, and a suspending hook is carved in the back of the head. The instrument appears to have been originally four-course, but has been altered rather crudely to six-course. Two early pegs remain.\n[rose] Bag with rose from Cittern (modern replacement)",

It became fashionable throughout Italy and central Europe following the publication in 1574 of Il primo libro di tabolaturo di citthara by Paolo Virchi, the son of a cittern maker from Brescia. This exquisitely carved instrument is highly important because it is decorated in the most fashionable style of the day and, unlike almost all Italian furniture of this period, it bears a date, 1582. Nothing is known about the maker, Augustinus Citaroedus: \u2018Citaroedus\u2019 literally means \u2018harper\u2019, so this is probably a generic term.\n\nOn loan to the Horniman Museum.",
