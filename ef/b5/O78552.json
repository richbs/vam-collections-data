Revolution in Japan in 1868 had brought an end to feudal rule and the start of a period of modernisation along western lines. Old systems of patronage disappeared and traditional objects became obsolete. Craftsmen turned their skills to the making of decorative objects for the expanding export market. The silversmith Konoike, who made the body of this teapot, was one such craftsman. He was based in the great trading port of Yokohama near Tokyo.\n\nPeople\nKonoike was specially commissioned to make this teapot by Liberty and Company. This famous London shop was founded by Arthur Lasenby Liberty in 1875. Liberty's specialised in selling goods imported from Asia and played an important part in fostering the late 19th-century craze for all things Japanese. From the 1880s Liberty also began to commission works from British designers, particularly those whose work was influenced by Japanese art.",
