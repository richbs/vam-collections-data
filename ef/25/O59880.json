The designs are clearly 'after' Bakst, whose designs with their bold colours,use of complementary colours and decorative motifs, created as much a sensation as the subject-matter and choreography.  There were innumerable prints 'after' Scheherazade and this in black and white hints at Bakst's own debt to Beardsley in his graphic style and erotic overtones.",
