Beneath the stems, in the upper half, are a cypress tree and a flowering tree; above the stems are two large sickle leaves - the lower curves to the left in overlapping blocks of colour, while the upper leaf is primarily yellow, has a serrated edge and contains a long floral spray.  Elsewhere there are balls of two interlocking colours and part of a dark pink cloudband as well as smaller flowers, buds and sprays.\n\nMain border: a dark pink ground with a floral meander of a slender green vine bearing a blue, cream-centred palmette that alternates with a green and pink rosette.\n\nInner guard stripe: a reciprocal 'Y' design in red and cream.",
