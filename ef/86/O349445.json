This was probably copied from the marble bust exhibited by Alfred Hone at the Academy 1843. Slingsby Duncombe was a radical member of parliament for Finsbury, who supported the Chartist movement, and was a parliamentary spokesman for the Liberation Society, which supported the claims of religious dissenters in the House of Commons. However the subject of another bust by Cheverton after Hone, also said to be of Duncombe, does not resemble the present subject here. So the present piece must be after Hone, who exhibited numerous marble portraits at the Royal Academy during the 1830s and 1840s. This ivory may well be one of those subjects, but it has not been possible to identify them through other images, and so the sitter of this bust must for the time being remain anonymous.",
