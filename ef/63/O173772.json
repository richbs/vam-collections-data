Jomon (literally 'rope pattern') wares, from which the name of the culture that produced  them is derived, are among the earliest ceramics ever made. They reached a peak of sophistication in terms of complexity of shape and patterning during the Middle Jomon period, when this particular jar was made. The meaning of the elaborate patterning found on this and comparable vessels is unknown, but archaeologists are generally agreed that it had some kind of ceremonial or ritual significance.",

Thus there are no illegal factors related to the sale of this piece.'\n\nRupert Faulkner, Asian Department, x2247, 30th May 2007",
