A single board of softwood, covered with dyed red leather, painted and gilded, with a central rectangular panel depicting a crowned princess and four female figures in front of six men in armour. The group is approaching a tent, in front of which are grouped six warriors.At each of the four corners of the panel, against a background of gilded repeat ornament, is a painted vellum(?) roundel (about 7-7.5cm diameter), with the head of a young woman (top corners) or a bearded man in Biblical style headress, against a grey-blue background. Running around the central panel, within plain black 'tracks', is a wide border with gilded repeat ornament, and outside that is a narrow border with similar gilded ornament. Placed at the corners and at the centre of the long borders, top and bottom, are six painted roundels (about 7-7.5cm diameter, on canvas) with the heads of men and women against blue-grey sky, apparently 17th century Italian. One (bottom left) is almost entirely missing, and it can be seen that is was glued over gilded ornament suggesting that it was not original. Across the front numerous small, cut iron nails have been driven through the leather. \n\nAt the bottom edge are the remains of fixing holes (partially filled) for two ring hinges. At the sides, near the top, are the remains of holes, presumably for two sliding bolts to retain the fall front in the closed position.\n\nThe back of the panel is plain wood, the surface very worm-eaten and with patches of epoxy resin filler.\n\nDecorative techniques\nThe main figurative scene is deep red dyed leather (apparently goat), painted with black and grey, with onlay sections of painted leather for the heads and bare legs and arms, and brown and green shields and skirts. Graphic detail has been added with mordant gilding. Some highlights in white paint were added after the gilding. The decorative gilding appears to have been laid out using a glue-bearing stamp.",
