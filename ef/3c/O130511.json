            "public_access_description": "This pendant was excavated from a cemetery to the north-west of Hlahun, near Al Fayyum middle Egypt. The moon shape (or lunula) was very popular in antique jewellery \u2013 enjoying a  popularity that was not limited to a specific region but spread throughout the Roman world. The emblem has been found adorning  women and children and also horses. To the ancient Egyptians it had represented Aoh the moon God who offered protection against the evil eye and witchery; it can be seen on mummy portraits and mummy costumes; later it became the emblem of the patricians of Rome and appears in Roman portraits.\n\nThe combination of the moon and cross suggests an origin in the 5/6th centuries. During this period, small crosses were produced in large numbers, and their production was not confined to precious metals. Indeed the majority of surviving pendant crosses are of less precious materials bronze, wood, bone etc They served as personal jewellery with amuletic properties. In the case of the present example, the pendant was probably worn by the deceased.  In conjunction with the cross, the emblem offered the carrier protection and was considered to guarantee an eternal life.",

The tips of the crescent may have been finished with small balls or pellet shapes, which almost met. The eyelet from which the cross would have been suspended, probably hung around the neck of the wearer, is situated on a small protruding arm attached to the top of  the crescent. Set inside the curvature of the moon is a cross. Earlier examples contain an ankh, the ancient Egyptian symbol of life.  \n\nThe moon shape (or lunula) was very popular in antique jewellery \u2013 enjoying a  popularity that was not limited to a specific region but spread throughout the Roman world.  The emblem has been found adorning women and children and also horses. To the ancient Egyptians it had represented Aoh, the moon God, who offered protection against the evil eye and witchery; it can be seen on mummy portraits and mummy costumes; later it became the emblem of the patricians of Rome and appears in Roman portraits.   \n\nThe combination of the moon and cross suggests an origin in the 5/6th centuries. During this period, small crosses were produced in large numbers, and their production was not confined to precious metals. Indeed the majority of surviving pendant crosses are of less precious materials bronze, wood, bone etc They served as personal jewellery with apotropaic properties. In the case of the present example, the pendant was probably worn by the deceased.  In conjunction with the cross, the emblem offered the carrier protection and was considered to guarantee an eternal life.\n\nOne of the best comparison pieces to the present cross, is a bronze, Coptic crescent with a cross (shown in Amulets \u2013 Petrie 1975) from, Shurafeh Egypt. Other examples include an eagle on a wall painting in Bawit of the 600s which wears a moon shape with cross on a necklace.\n\nChristianity arrived in Egypt from Judea. It probably first came into Alexandria, which was both an intellectual centre and the home of a large Jewish community. Christianity was heavily persecuted in the third century AD, but was widely accepted by the end of the fourth century. The Christian church within Egypt was known as the Coptic church, from a corruption of the Greek word for Egyptians, Aiguptioi. The term 'Coptic period' is a very approximate one; it may be thought of as running from the third century AD until around the time of the visible decline of Christianity in the ninth century AD. It is roughly equivalent to the Byzantine period elsewhere in the Mediterranean world.",
