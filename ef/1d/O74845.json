            "public_access_description": "This miniature is quite unlike anything else that Isaac Oliver is known to have painted. The image is built up entirely in terms of light and shade, stippled with tiny flecks of paint, without the definitive outline that had been the ideal of Nicholas Hilliard and other early miniature painters. Oliver is here striving to copy the effects of Italian Baroque painting, with its misty religiosity. This miniature was in the collection of the famous 18th-century collector Dr Richard Mead, and was particularly admired at that time for the soft-focus effect of its extraordinary stipple technique, which was reminiscent of the work of the Italian artist Antonio Correggio (1489-1534). When it was painted, however, there was little interest among English patrons for anything other than portraiture, and one can only speculate for whom such a work would have been intended.",

Full Citation:\n\n\u201cISAAC OLIVER\n\n<b>175 Head of Christ</b>, probably after c. 1610\n\n<i>Victoria & Albert Museum (P.15-1931)</i>\nVellum stuck to plain card, oval, 53, 43 mm, 2 1/8 x 1 23/32 in.\n\nOne of the most extraordinary of all Oliver\u2019s miniatures, both in respect of style and subject-matter.  The head is built up entirely in terms of light and shade without any linear effects which sets it apart as an extreme example of the artist\u2019s reaction to Hilliard\u2019s linear tradition and a vivid index of his own response to Italian Renaissance painting.\n\nThe daring of the <i>Head of Christ</i> is not easy, nor is it helped by any stylistic parallels.  I would be include to date t after c. 1610.  That religious works were coming back into fashion may be measured by Robert Cecil\u2019s decoration of the Chapel at Hatfield House.  Indeed the closest parallel is the bust of Christ at Hatfield which was there before 1629, probably one of Robert Cecil\u2019s purchases, by an unidentified Italian artist of the early Baroque period (E. Auerbach and C. K. Adams, <i>Paintings and Sculpture at Hatfield House</i>, London, 1971, p. 109 (119), pl. 94).  The head is of a generalized North Italian type in the manner of Correggio, which would account for the very high Esteem in which it was held in the eighteenth century, though modern taste prefers Oliver\u2019s portraits to what are now regarded as derivative religious pieces.  There is slight abrasion on the cheek and bear and slight losses at the edge.\n\nINSCRIBED: Signed to the right: <i>IO</i> in monogram.\n\nCOLLECTIONS:  Dr Richard Mead (1673-1754); recorded by Vertue between 1736 and 1741 (<i>Notebooks</i>, IV, <i>Walpole Society</i>, XXIV, 1934-35, p. 187); recorded in <i>Musei Meadiani Pars Altera,</i> Langford, 1755 under the section <i>Picturae Minori Formae</i>: \u201cChristi caput longa caesarie falvescente promissa barbe et oculis occlusis, cui gratias omnes divinas circumfluit artiflex.  <i>Isaaci Oliver celberrimi pictoris opus praestantissimum\u201d (in the British Library\u2019s Life of Dr. Richard Mead.
