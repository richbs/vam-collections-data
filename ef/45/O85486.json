            "public_access_description": "By the late 17th century the design of brass candlesticks began to imitate that of their silver counterparts. Technical improvements in the casting of both base and precious metal candlesticks also substantially altered their form.\n\nIn the mid 1760s, when neo-classicism was popular, the characteristic shape for candlesticks was a straight or tapering column on a raised square or oval base. Later, beaded, engraved and relief ornament was added, and neo-classical types probably continued to be made in brass long after they had ceased to be popular in silver. Production of these candlesticks was further simplified by the development of casting the stem in one piece using a removable core, a process called hollow core casting. This allowed for a much finer and thinner casting to be made for both the base and the stem. It also encouraged the development of the multi-faceted candlestick form in the early 19th century, which was only made in brass. This example is one of a pair of candlesticks, each in the form of a cupid holding the socket and standing on a cylindrical pedestal set on a square base and slate plinth.",
