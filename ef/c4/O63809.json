She became famous for dancing en pointe, not as an acrobatic stunt, but as an aesthetic decision in choreography.\nThe case was designed and produced by the manufacturer Chamberlain Worcester in the early 1800s. Although the case is primarily made of leather embossed with gold powder in a fashionable foliage design, the central panel is made with enamelled porcelain, decorated with flowers. This glamorous case held Taglioni's business cards (S.853:2&3-2001).",

These she passed to Cyril Beaumont, probably for the London Archives of the Dance (a number of the objects were referred to in \"The London Archives of the Dance and some of its Treasures\" by Cyril Beaumont, Ballet Annual, first issue, Adam & Charles Black, London, 1947, p110); the Archives never achieved an independent home and part of the collection, including the Taglioni memorabilia, was stored with Cyril Beaumont, where it became inextricably mixed with his own collection and came to the Museum as part of the Cyril Beaumont Bequest.",
