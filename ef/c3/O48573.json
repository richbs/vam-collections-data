Sardine forks were a Victorian refinement for serving the expensive and popular tinned fish.\n\nDining Etiquette\nDining etiquette formed an important part of the Victorian code of polite society. The Manners and Tone of Good Society, first published in 1879, outlined the correct conduct of the dinner party but focused on the complicated and changing use of cutlery. With a few exceptions (such as for eating bread and some fruit) touching food with the fingers was frowned upon. Diners were presented with an alarming and growing range of specialist utensils for eating particular foods. It was important to be able to recognise items such as lobster picks, sardine forks and grape scissors, and to know how to use them correctly.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe engraved fish incorporated into the design suggests the fork's function. However, the broad, five-pronged shape of the fork and the short handle are very similar to the form of the bread fork, and it is possible that forks with a less specific decoration could have been used to serve bread.",

Sardine forks were a Victorian refinement for serving the expensive and popular tinned fish.<br><br>\n\n<b>Dining Etiquette</b><br>\nDining etiquette formed an important part of the Victorian code of polite society. <i>The Manners and Tone of Good Society</i>, first published in 1879, outlined the correct conduct of the dinner party but focused on the complicated and changing use of cutlery. With a few exceptions (such as for eating bread and some fruit) touching food with the fingers was frowned upon. Diners were presented with an alarming and growing range of specialist utensils for eating particular foods. It was important to be able to recognise items such as lobster picks, sardine forks and grape scissors, and to know how to use them correctly.<br><br>\n\n<b>Design & Designing</b><br>\nThe engraved fish incorporated into the design suggests the fork's function. However, the broad, five-pronged shape of the fork and the short handle are very similar to the form of the bread fork, and it is possible that forks with a less specific decoration could have been used to serve bread.",
