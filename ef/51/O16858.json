The British had captured this port-city in Malaysia from the Dutch in 1795, partly to ensure that it could not be used for attacks on British shipping. British administrators and civilians soon began to investigate the flora and fauna of the area and recruited the indigenous Chinese artists to make drawings of them. This painting depicts a common crested pigeon (Goura cristata). It comes from an album of 19 natural history pictures from the collection of Lord Clive, 1st Earl of Powis, who was Governor of Madras between 1798 and 1803. Four of the paintings are in the V&A. The remaining 15 are in the Oriental and India Office Collections of the British Library.",
