The sides are channelled above the arris and the rounded section above is enamelled also in dark blue on transverse hatching.

II, p. 134, no. 103; Long 1930, p. 37; Murdoch 1978, p. 287, fig. 25; Summary Catalogue, 1981, p. 31; Murdoch 1981, p. 99, pl, 15f (repro. in colour); Reynolds 1988, p. 40. \n\nNo evidence for the identification has come down with the miniature, and the identity of 'Sir George Heron', which may be a nineteenth-century invention, is by no means certain. The most likely family would be that of the Baronets of Chipchase in Northumberland (2) one of whose ancestors, some of whom were knighted, was Colonel George Heron: he 'lost his life at Marston Moor in defence of his king and country, temp. Car. I. (3) No other portraits of him are recorded.  \n \nStylistically the miniature is interesting as a Hoskins work of the mid-1630s, showing little influence from Van Dyck, yet signed with a form of monogram usually associated with such directly Van Dyckian portraits as the <i>4th Earl of Dorset</i> (Cat. No. 35) and <i>Catherine Howard</i> (Cat. No. 29). It is hardly possible, however, to see Sir George Heron as by the same hand as the former, with its especially bold and aggressive hatching. The similarities of handling are with the latter and with the Katherine Bruce (Cat.
