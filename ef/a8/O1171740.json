The top of the design is on a separate piece of paper that is attached to the main piece with a metal pin. The design has been copied from a pattern probably by pricking the original along the lines of the design and pouncing black powder through the holes. The result is this printed design. The outline of the cross has been reinforced with pencil.  It is a working pattern with additional pinholes and annotated with a number perhaps to indicate the colour of thread using the manufacturer's code. The pattern would in turn have to be pricked and pounced to transfer the design to the textile.\n\nThe pattern shape indicates that it was probably for an embroidered priest's stole, a vestment consisting of a long narrow cloth band worn around the neck and falling from the shoulder.  The type of pattern is similar to ones illustrated in Thomas Brown & Son, Manufactuerers of Laces, Damask & Fringes for Church purposes and Embroiderers, about 1877-1878.  The passion flower symbolises Christ's Passion in eth Christian religion.",
