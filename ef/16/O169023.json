Philip Oliver Goldsmith, a salesman for a small optical firm, founded his eyewear company in London in 1926. In 1935 his son Charles Goldsmith entered the firm with the aim of making glasses a fashion item. From the company\u2019s offices in Poland Street, his sons A. Oliver and Ray Goldsmith built upon the company\u2019s reputation for attention-grabbing designs and solicited celebrity endorsement for their products. Key clients included Lord Snowdon, the actress Diana Dors, Princess Grace of Monaco and Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\nMichael, the name given to this design, refers to A. Oliver Goldsmith\u2019s childhood friend. Goldsmith designed it at a time when he was experimenting with the traditional \u2018keyhole\u2019, the arch of the glasses\u2019 frame that covers the bridge of the nose. In the 1930s and 1940s, glasses usually featured a literal keyhole-shaped void. Here, Goldsmith has softened this shape, which helped make it a popular and wearable design. In addition, the frame features three chanier joints, which made adjustments easier because the joints were more flexible.",
