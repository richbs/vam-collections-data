            "public_access_description": "Oliver Messel (1904-1978) was Britain's leading theatre designer of the 1930s, '40s and '50s. He created settings and costumes for all forms of entertainment - ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue - as well as working in interior decoration and textile design. His lavish, painterly and romantic concepts were perfectly in tune with the times and earned him an international reputation.  By 1960, however, that style was becoming unfashionable, and Messel gradually abandoned theatre and built a new career designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.  \n\nRing Round the Moon, a translation of Jean Anouilh's play L'Invitation au Ch\u00e2teau by Christopher Fry who described it as a charade with music, was first performed at the Globe Theatre (now the Gielgud Theatre), in 1950. It takes place in a winter garden and the director, Peter Brook, suggested that the setting should be a hothouse with plants and trees.  \n\nAccording to Carl Toms, Messel's assistant, Messel took his inspiration from a Portuguese railway station.  To give the set a light, weightless quality, he insisted that it should be made from metal rather than wood, which was then the standard material used for theatre set building. Although untypical of Messel's style, the set is one of his most memorable designs, and complemented the elegance and fantasy of Fry's poetic drama.",

The production, presented by H. M. Tennent Productions Ltd, was directed by Peter Brook, with a cast that included Paul Scofield, Claire Bloom and Margaret Rutherford.  \n\nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's theatre designs and other designs and artefacts.  The designs were briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being housed at the V&A from 1981 on indefinite loan.  The V&A Theatre Museum purchased the Oliver Messel collection from Lord Snowdon in 2005.",
