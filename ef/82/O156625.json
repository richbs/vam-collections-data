The foot of the cup is in the form of a tortoise surmounting four naturalistic feet. The exterior rim is chased with circular patterns and, above, plain tongues enclose a piece of polished turban shell, which is carved to resemble the shell of a tortoise. Four braided straps cross the shell connecting the perimeter of the tortoise to the central stem section. The cup is formed from the turban shell which has four straps; the three in front in the form of figures, masks and volutes all terminating in lion masks. The rear vertebrally decorated terminates in foliate decoration. The applied silver-gilt rim undulates in order to accommodate the natural shape of the shell and give an even surface at top, is flat-chased with scroll-and-foliate decoration.",

Originally developed by Italian painters in Florence and at Fontainebleau during the 1530s, the Mannerist style soon spread to northern Europe. \n\nThe Rosalinde and Arthur Gilbert Schatzkammer is one of the few collections of its kind formed in the late 20th century. The Schatzkammer, or treasury, was a new concept in the 16th century. It referred to a special chamber in which the most precious artefacts of a princely collection were housed.  Gold and jewelled objects were mounted alongside exotic natural curiosities, including rock crystal, nautilus shells and ostrich eggs. Together they demonstrated not only the wonders of nature and the technical achievements of the artist, but also the intellect and culture of the patron. \n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
