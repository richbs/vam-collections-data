            "physical_description": "Shirt or blouse in plain weave silk embroidered with silk in straight stitches and pulled thread work, cut work, needleweaving; whitework, faced with plain weave roller printed cotton.\nUndyed silk embroidered on the cuffs and on the front. It has long, loose sleeves set at right angles to the main front and back panels.  There is a lozenge-shaped gusset under each arm.  There are no shoulder seams.  There is a very long [36 cm] front slit which is faced with printed cotton.\nThe front and sleeve ends of the shirt/blouse are patterned with white silk embroidery. The sleeve ends are decorated with a composite band of straight stitched lozenge motifs [a], a ribbon meander [b], followed by a row of 8-pointed stars touching with an infill of pulled thread work [c], then a row of needlewoven lozenges, and finished with a repeat of [b] and [c]. The edge of each sleeve is a selvedge.\nThe front is embroidered on the two side panels as far as the underarm and down the central panel from the neck opening. The right side has a rectangle of patterning delineated by [a] and [b], with the addition of [c] top and bottom.  The infill is a large cypress-like motif in pulled thread work and straight stitch, with a leafy plant either side top and bottom. The left side has a small rectangle similarly bordered but infilled with a cartouche infilled with two 8-petalled stars resting on a triangle top and bottom and a leafy plant either side, again a mixture of straight stitches and pulled thread work. The edges of the front slit are bordered with [b] and [c], then diagonal bands of straight stitch, then [b] and [a]. From the neck downwards either side a line of large cartouches and irregular botehs, the latter with cut work and infilled with needlewoven bars and the former with straight stitch and pulled thread work.  Two pulled thread lozenges are at the base of the slit patterning and a row of straight stitch leafy plants along the bottom edge.\nThe silk for the woven fabric is Z-twisted; the silk for the embroidery is Z-twisted.\nFacing: a leafy arabesque with small rosettes in light blue, blue, beige and light brown.",
