The gilt leather strips are stitched at intervals in bands down the front. Gilt leather trims the bottom. The dress fastens with hooks at either side of the front neck and there is a hook fastening at the placket.\n\nWith the designer's hallmark of understated elegance, the frail semi-transparent fabric is inventively decorated with machine-stitched applique strips of gilded kid leather.",

Shimmering strips of gilded leather enhance the diaphanous fabric. Each minute strip is perfectly positioned and carefully stitched around the edges to form a strong and regular vertical pattern over the entire garment. The strips appear to fall like a continuous shower of gold, emphasising the gown's flowing style. It has an unfitted bodice and voluminous sleeves which are gathered at the wrists. A column-like skirt falls in soft folds from the gathered waist to the hem. \n\nJeanne Lanvin was born in Brittany. In 1890 she opened her millinery shop on the rue Faubourg Saint Honor\u00e9 and attracted a large clientele. Lanvin maintained that the exquisite embroideries for which her house became famous were the foundations of her collections. Her inspiration and choice of colours often came from nature or works of art.",
