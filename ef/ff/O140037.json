The play concerns the meeting of four holiday-makers in Tuscany with a fugitive who claims to have momentous  knowledge of a conspiracy involving the Vatican, an Italian dealer in antiquities and a Jewish preacher. This production starred Sir Derek Jacobi (b.1938).\n\nThe mysterious nature of the play is manifested in the design of the advertising poster. The main attraction being Derek Jacobi, his face is clearly seen. It is, however, a reflection in what seems to be a car rear-view mirror. His shocked expression, combined with the bullet-hole in what must be the windshield, give an impression of the 'thriller' essence of the play. The sunset, visible through the uncracked areas of glass, and trees are reminiscent of the Italian countryside.",
