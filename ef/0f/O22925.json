For the Fair they did not make a real chair, but constructed two full-sized models, one made out of metal and the other of cardboard, shown here in dramatically lit photograph. A number of other cardboard models had to be made to refine the design before the chair could be made for sale. The first buyer was an American from Florida who had been to the Milan show.\n[Michael Snodin, 'British Design at Home', p.167]",
