Threats to the Queen's safety increased, especially from Spain, and the fashion for wearing the Queen's image to express loyalty and devotion became established.  From the late 1580s there was a proliferation of portraits of the Queen.\n\n People\nElizabeth I rarely sat for portraits, since from one sitting a 'pattern' would be produced that other artists would copy. This face pattern by Hilliard, called today the 'Mask of Youth', was so successful that 16 versions in miniature have survived. Elizabeth was around 60 at this date, but Hilliard reduced the Queen's features to a few schematic lines, thereby rejuvenating her face. He then focussed on her sumptuous costume and jewels. This was not just vanity. The Queen had no heir and her succession was still undecided.  Her government did not want to focus on her mortality and the Queen's official image became highly stylised, presenting a reassuring, ageless and powerful national icon.\n\nMaterials & Making\nNicholas Hilliard was a goldsmith and developed special techniques for painting jewels. Pearls were painted with a raised blob of white 'with a pretty little tooth of some ferret or stoat', as Hilliard's own treatise records. Sadly, silver tarnishes and the pearls and other areas in silver now appear black.",

ISBN 1851773088.\nPainted when Elizabeth I was sixty, this portrait by Nicholas Hilliard, the best known of English miniature painters, conferred on the queen a \"mask of youth,\" reducing her features to a few schematic lines and concentrating on her magnificent dress. This is not the portrait of an individual but an icon for a nation apprehensive about an aging, childless queen, a symbol of power not withered by time.\nAlthough miniatures now have a place in national culture, Horace Walpole, an eighteenth-century owner of this miniature, set such early works against Continental standards and found them more alien than English. He wrote that painting Elizabeth I was as limiting to \"genius\" as painting an \"Indian Idol.\" The first miniature purchased by the Museum, in 1857, also of Elizabeth I by Hilliard, was in fact catalogued and displayed for its decorative case. At that time no English national museum had a brief to collect miniatures.\nThis Hilliard miniature was included in the Museum's groundbreaking 1865 exhibition of miniatures and entered the V&A permanently in 1882. It was acquired as part of the John Jones bequest, primarily devoted to French decorative art (cats. 84-86). Although Jones's numerous examples of foreign miniatures painted in enamels could be accommodated in the Museum's already substantial collection of enamels, the few English watercolour miniatures as yet had a less certain role.\n\nLit.
