The waist is several inches above the natural level at the back and sides, curving to a low point at the centre front.  There are nine waist tabs.  One to three lines of narrow silver-gilt braid have been applied to the edges and seams of the garment.  The original salmon pink taffeta lining has been covered over later with beige ribbed silk; the interlining is made of linen.  The belly-pieces reinforcing the lower front edges are stiffened, probably with whalebone.  An interior lacing band of linen covered with silk bears 47 eyelets reinforced with stitching.   The doublet fastens down the front with 35 buttons on the body and 4 silver-gilt and silk braid loops; the 39 original buttons are missing.  Each sleeve has 9 buttonholes at the wrist \u2013 all buttons now missing.  Seven modern hooks and eyes have been attached to the belly piece for display purposes Buttonhole loops worked in brown silk parallel to the lower waist seam on each side of the front probably served to hold the sword belt in place.",
