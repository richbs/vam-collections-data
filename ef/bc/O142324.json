However, he began as an artist and was taught drawing by his father Samuel John Carter, an animal painter.  Carter excavated in Egypt from 1892, first for the Egypt Exploration Fund, then for the Egyptian Antiquities Service until 1903 and from 1907 for Lord Carnarvon. In the early years he supplemented his income by painting and selling watercolours of birds. \nMany visitors to Egypt drew or commented on the number and variety of its birds. Among them was Edward Lear, artist, traveller, nonsense writer, and, in his early career, ornithological draughtsman. One species - the Pelican inspired one of his most famous nonsense poems, The Pelican Chorus (1877): \n\nWe live on the Nile. The Nile we love. \nBy night we sleep on the cliffs above;\nBy day we fish, and at eve we stand \nOn long bare islands of yellow sand.",
