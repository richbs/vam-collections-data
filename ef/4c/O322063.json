            "physical_description": "[Letter rack] The letter rack is formed of two decorated panels of different sizes, each in the shape of a stylised flower head, possibly a peony. The larger panel is positioned behind the smaller one. Upright side panels are set at right angles and slightly in from the edges of the decorated panels and pinned to them with small metal pins which are visible on the front panel and on the back of the larger panel. The panels are attached to a rectangular base, possibly fitted with a groove into which the two decorative panels are inserted. The base has four turned wooden circular feet. \n\nAreas of damage on W.94A-1926, the pair to this letter rack, show that the decorated panels and the base appear to be made of layers of brown paper sheets. The paper, made of rags, was supplied in sheets which were cut to shape and laid on a greased mould to be smoothed over with a hand tool to remove bubbles and impurities. Further sheets were added, pasted together and stove dried before a further process of oiling and stove drying to make the paper strong, hard and water resistant. This process also changed the colour of the paper from grey to brown. The panels and base would have been fitted together and the feet added by a cabinet maker and then the letter rack polished before being covered with two base coats of black varnish, each coat being stove dried before the next coat was applied. The painted decoration was then added by hand, a transparent varnish applied and a final polish given.\n\nThe front panel is painted with a scene of two priests in vestments in front of a rood screen fitted with low seats covered in red fabric. The priest on the right stands in a doorway with a shield above it. Behind the screen are stone arches with pillars. The back panel is painted with a stained glass window and a flag hanging against the stone walls on either side. Painted on the front left hand side of the base is the inscription, 'Jennens & Bettridge'.\n[Letter rack] The letter rack is constructed in the same way as W.94-1929. The front painted panel shows a procession of priests in vestments, entering a church through a large stone archway. On the left is a tree and on the right a large stained glass window. The larger, back panel is painted with a scene of an organ loft, with a red curtained doorway below. On either side of the loft is a flag hanging from the stone wall and beyond each of the flags is a stained glass window. The left hand front edge of the base is painted with the inscription, Jennens & Bettridge.",

Manufacturers in the West Midlands, like Jennens & Bettridge whose name is painted and stamped on these letter racks, were highly inventive in their technical innovations. Their products made wholly or part of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 ranged from large pieces of furniture, like beds or settees, to trays, fans, card cases, crumb trays, and containers for stationery. Often skilled artists were employed to decorate pieces with a wide range of subjects, including landscapes, medieval buildings or naturalistic floral sprays. The slightly incongruous combination of exotic flower or leaf shapes for the panels, and ecclesiastical themes, for the decoration, on these letter racks was typical of many papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 pieces and reflected contemporary interest in the Gothic Revival as well as in botany.",
