Sadler experimented with transfer-printing on white glazed delftware tiles, transferring images from engraved copper plates to tiles, using enamel colours fixed in low-temperature firing.\n\nActors and actresses could become big stars in the 18th century, when theatres, concert halls and pleasure gardens were the major forms of public entertainment.  Engravers regularly produced images of paintings of the most popular performers, so the ability to reproduce engravings on ceramics was a lucrative development.  Since the engravings were transfer-printed, the original images appear on the tiles in reverse.\n\nJohn Moody was born in Cork, the son of a hairdresser named Cochran. He followed his father's trade before travelling to Jamaica where he joined a theatre company. On his return in 1758 he became a principal actor on the Norwich circuit, specialising in heroes and lovers. He first appeared in London at Drury Lane in 1759 and with the exception of one season at the Haymarket, a few performances at Covent Garden, and touring engagements, Moody remained at Drury Lane until the end of his career. He first played Teague in the 1760-61 season and it became one of his most successful parts.",
