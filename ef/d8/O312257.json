            "public_access_description": "Often cast in bronze or lead, but sometimes struck in silver or even gold, the portrait medal commemorated individuals and often associated events.  Many specialist sculptors from the Renaissance onwards were attracted to this small-scale art form. Inspired by Roman coins, often with portraits on the obverse and allegorical representations on the reverse, medals were used as gifts and mementoes and eagerly collected. The medal format proved ideal for this type of personal and intimate object. This medal depicts Henri II de Bourbon, Prince de Cond\u00e9, and his wife Charlotte de Montmorency, who had married two years before it was made.\n\nHenri II de Bourbon (1 September 1588 \u2013 26 December 1646) was also known as the Prince of Cond\u00e9 after the death of his father. He had the rank of Premier Prince du Sang (Foremost Prince of the Blood) as a legitimate member of the ruling dynasty of France, then the House of Bourbon, and specifically heir to the throne of France until the birth of the Dauphin (later Louis XIII). In 1609 he married Charlotte-Marguerite de Montmorency who was then only 15. She had come to the attention of the King and the newly-wed couple fled France. The following year Henri IV died and his son, Louis XIII ruled with his mother as Regent. The Regency was commemorated in a medal by Dupre of the same date as this one (V&A museum number A.356-1910). \n\nIn 1614 Henri II de Bourbon led a rebellion to try to curb the influence of Concino Concini, the Marquis d\u2019Ancre, a favourite of the powerful Regent. Henri and his wife were imprisoned in Vincennes in 1616, but freed and pardoned after Ancre was assassinated. \n\nGuillaume Dupr\u00e9 (1579-1644) was court medallist to Henri IV and principal sculptor to the King. His grasp of the Italian tradition, together with his considerable technical skills, enabled him to cast medals in a style that proved influential on succeeding generations of French medallists. During the reign of Louis XIII his career continued, not only as a medallist but also as a much-praised cannon founder on a large scale, working as Commissaire G\u00e9n\u00e9ral des fontes de l\u2019artillerie de France.",
