            "public_access_description": "This is an album of 42 leaves containing 356 drawings and prints of goldsmiths' work and jewellery, 3 trade cards and 2 loose manuscript sheets, associated with the Paris workshops of Jean Ducrollay (1710-1787), Piere-Fran\u00e7ois Drais (1726-1788), and Charles Ouizille (1744-1830). The designs in the album date from about 1735-1820 and includes those for snuffboxes, scent holders, watches and watch cases, spoons, fans and fan mounts, small swords, and chatelaines (ornamental chains, pins, or clasps usually worn at a woman's waist, to which trinkets, keys, purses, or other articles are attached). The album is bound in red morocco and the boards are stamped in gilt with the arms, now partly erased, of a member of the Bourbon family, probably Louis-Henri, Prince of Cond\u00e9 (1692-1740).  \n\nDucrollay, Drais and Ouizille formed a series of connected partnerships. Jean Ducrollay became a master in 1734 and is believed to have retired in 1761.  He was succeeeded by Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Drais, his cousin and one of his chefs d'atelier. Drais became a master in 1763, jeweller to the King in 1770, and worked until his death in 1788.  In 1786 Drais became associated with Charles Ouizille. Ouizille, who had become master in 1771, became one of the King's jewellers in 1784.  In 1816 he formed a partnership with Adrien-Jean-Maximilien Vachette (also a royal jeweller) and in 1820 with Petitjean. Ouizille died in 1830.\n\nThe close relationship between the contents of the album and known work by the three goldsmiths establishes that the material emanates from their workshops, as is suggested by the first page. Most of the material dates from the period 1755-90.",

These are perhaps associated with the collections of the Prince de Cond\u00e9.  The process of filling the album began at the back of the account book; the pages have now been numbered in that order. Page 1 has pasted on it three trade cards, described in detail in each catalogue record ( see E.897:3-5-1988). Direct markings on the pages are detailed in the Marks/Subjects tab.\n\nThe drawings and prints are arranged to a large extent haphazardly, objects of different dates being mixed up and several pieces being pasted in upside-down, but the presence of occasional aesthetically-related groupings may reflect gatherings of material when the album was being put together.  The date of that process is uncertain. Although the first drawings certain to date from after 1800 (four in all) do not appear until p.64, there is no break in consistency of layout through the album, so it appears likely that the material was inserted at one go in the early nineteenth century. This idea is supported by the nature of the first page, with its careful exposition of the originators of the album's contents, although the mention of Arrivet, for which space has been allowed between the trade cards, remains a mystery.  The annotations and drawings directly on the pages indicate that the album was kept in a workshop, presumably as a record of useful designs.\n\nDucrollay, Drais and Ouizille formed a series of connected partnerships. Jean Ducrollay became a master in 1734 and is believed to have retired in 1761.  He was succeeded by Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Drais, his cousin and one of his <i>chefs d'atelier</i>. Drais became a master in 1763, jeweller to the King in 1770, and worked until his death in 1788. In 1786 Drais became associated with Charles Ouizille.
