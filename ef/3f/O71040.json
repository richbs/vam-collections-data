Although it would have been used as a dressing table, it was chiefly made as an object to inspire admiration and envy. \n\nThe German cabinetmaker David Roentgen, whose workshop designed and made this piece, was famous throughout Europe in the 18th century. He prided himself on extremely complex locking mechanisms and startling gadgetry that might fling open several drawers at the turn of a single key. He was also famous for very refined marquetry. Unlike most makers of the time he did not use hot sand to shade wood or engraving tools to add fine detail to his designs: every detail, including shadows and fine shading, was carried out in different coloured woods.",

That piece is marked on its backboard with the inventory mark of the Chateau de Versailles and may have been supplied by Roentgen for Louis XVI's private apartment, although it is also possible that the backboard has been transferred to this commode from another piece.  At least one more commode with similar panels of marquetry must have been made in the 1780s by Roentgen because some of its panels and its gilt-brass mounts survive in a an ebony cabinet-on-stand attributed to the nineteenth-century Parisian cabinet-maker Alfred Beurdeley (1802-1882), now in a private collection.",
