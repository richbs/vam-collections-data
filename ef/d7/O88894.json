It illustrates Brandt's early photographic career in Vienna, Hungary, Hamburg, Paris, Barcelona, Madrid and London.  In addition to being of primary importance to Brandt's biography, the album illustrates many of the major themes of his oeuvre, such as night life in the St. Paul's district of Hamburg, everyday scenes in Paris and, most importantly, the subject matter of his first two books, 'The English at Home' (1936) and 'A Night in London' (1938).  Many key works are included here in what must be their earliest versions, as relatively small prints (often contact prints).  In addition, these are illuminating photographs that have so far not been published, such as a view of Brandt's bedroom in Paris in 1933, which includes the Surrealist journal 'Varietes'.",
