            "physical_description": "Plain weave cotton embroidered with silk in surface darning and running stitch and pulled thread work with a backing of silk satin and a bias-cut facing of silk satin. This cover is pieced together from three different embroideries. The backing is pieced and is pink satin and the facing is blue satin.\n[1] The largest piece of embroidery is two pieces joined with a diagonal seam.  The ground is pulled thread work overcast with cream silk to form a square mesh.  Two rows of geometric motifs are off-set.  [a] green octagon containing a yellow square with four green and  pink 'arms' - like a swastika.  This alternates with a yellow star containing a pink swastika  and with floral motifs coming from the four diagonal points. [b] light brown octagon containing a yellow and blue swastika [there is one red arm in the lowest motif] alternating with a red diamond.  The motifs are outlined with black blocks.  The border is red with yellow S-motifs and a green or blue diagonal bar.\n[2] The piece of embroidery down the left hand side has a pulled thread ground overcast with cream silk to form a square mesh. It is an incomplete pattern on a larger scale: there are three indented lozenges divided into segments in green and light blue each with red detail.  The centre is pink with two yellow sections linked by a fine black line to a central light green lozenge. Between two lower lozenges is a blue and pink cross within a yellow square.  The motifs are outlined with black blocks.  The border has a red ground with a fine black meander linking blue lozenges and a yellow lozenge with dark green leaves.\n[3] The third piece of embroidery forms a narrow section along the upper left hand side and part of the way down between  [1] and [2].  It has a pulled thread ground overcast with cream silk to form a square mesh. It is impossible to identify the design but the dominant colours are dark red, light green, turquoise and light brown.  \nThere is a small patch in the upper border which may be related to [3] as it adjoins it, but it has surface darning on the diagonal.  Turquoise, faded pink and white with black cross stitch.\nEmbroidery threads: 2S silk. [1] white, black, light green, green, pink, red, brown, light brown, blue, yellow.\n[2] white, black, yellow, light green, light blue, pink, red, green, dark green.\n[3] dark red, light green, turquoise and light brown.",
