The Hungarian People\u2019s Party was the successor of the National Peasants\u2019 Party founded at the end of the 1930s. The National Peasants\u2019s Party had gathered together people looking for \u2018a third way\u2019, avoiding both Western and Eastern political models and seeking solutions for the specific problems of Hungary. The Hungarian People\u2019s Party, organised in 1989, followed the example of its predecessor in standing up for peasants and village populations and representing the interests of agriculture. The poster displays a face well known to everyone in Hungary: S\u00e1ndor Petofi, a romantic poet of the 19th century and a hero of the 1848 revolution. His life is traditionally regarded as an example of patriotism and the struggle for freedom and an independent fatherland. During the 1956 Hungarian Revolution the Hungarian National Peasants\u2019 Party briefly reformed and took the name Petofi Party. The years 1939, 1956, 1989 printed on the poster therefore mark important points in the party\u2019s history.",
