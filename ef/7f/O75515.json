            "public_access_description": "Frank Brangwyn was born in Belgium and he strongly identified with its fate during the First World War. The War Office wanted to withdraw his 1914 recruiting poster commissioned by Frank Pick for the London Underground Railways as it felt the poster was too horrific. However, it drew recruits in huge numbers and the War Office relented. He was not asked to make another by the military, but the US Government commissioned a recruiting poster for its Navy as soon as America entered the war in 1917. In Britain it was only in 1918 that Brangwyn was officially commissioned by the  National War Savings Committee to prepare a poster for their autumn War Bonds campaign, for which this image was a proof. In the published version the caption reads 'Back Him Up Buy War Bonds'.",
