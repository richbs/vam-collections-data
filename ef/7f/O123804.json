It was named after the 6th Earl of Chesterfield, a leader of fashion during the 1830s, and became popular in about 1840.\n\nThis example is particularly interesting as it has an early example of a tailor's label on the inside breast pocket. The tailor was S. Nelson of 18 Hanover Street, Hanover Square, London. The date 1895 is written beside the client's name (unfortunately illegible). It is unusual to be able to date a coat made at this time so precisely as the changes in men's tailoring styles tended to be very subtle.\n\nThe Chesterfield had several distinctive features. It was slightly waisted, with a short back vent, and it usually had a velvet collar. It had flapped side pockets and a small ticket pocket on the outside right breast, which was introduced in the late 1850s. \n\nIt remained the most fashionable style of overcoat in the 1890s. There were several different varieties. These included the 'Long' Chesterfield, which reached to the calf, the 'Sac-back', and the 'Caped', which was loose-fitting with an elbow-length cape but no sleeves.",
