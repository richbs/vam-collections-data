She graduated from the prestigious Hong-ik University in 1976 and has since exhibited in numerous group and solo exhibitions and also won several awards.\n\n\"Poetic Spirit '97\" could be viewed as a fusion of old and new. Its shape, materials and colours well represent the artist's interest in combining traditional Korean aesthetic sentiments with contemporary shapes and ideas. The title of the piece derives from the poems seen on the front of the scroll. The printed pages have been extracted from books dating to the Choson period (1392-1910), which the artist has attached to a piece of hand-dyed woven wool. Half of the scroll is red and the other half green, thus symbolising the changing forces of um and yang (yin and yang in Chinese). The concept of um and yang corresponds to negative and positive charges in all entities and are thus applicable to ethics, medicine and cosmology to name but a few. Though its early history is obscure, the concept of um and yang dates back to Chinese writings of the 5th century BC and was, and still continues to be, of great importance also in Korea. For example, the roundel of two interlocking commas, one yin and one yang, is called t'aeguk and features on the national flag of the Republic of South Korea.",
