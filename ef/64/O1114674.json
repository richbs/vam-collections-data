Both cloak and tunic are made from canvas/linen, the cloak is lined with cotton and the tunic with glazed cotton. Both have been decorated with painted motifs. The tunic is primarily silver and decorated at the hem with a series of horizontal bands in gold, dark blue/grey and leaf green, all of which have been painted on to the fabric. The centre front is decorated with a motif of triangles in metallic gold braid which have been appliqu\u00e9d in three vertical rows across the chest. The long sleeves end in an uneven 'pointed' edge which covers the back, but not front, of the hand, and fasten with press studs at the wrist. The cloak has a pale red background with a repeated pattern of pale yellow circles across the front and back, each stencilled with an orange motif (similar in form to the spokes of a wheel). A band of darker yellow runs around the collar and hem, and this is bordered by a thick black line.",

It is associated with the new designs she created for a re-staging of the company's famous work The Firebird in 1926 (originally designed by Alexandre Golovin in 1910). This was one of several ballets that Goncharova designed for the Ballets Russes, she and her husband, (the artist Michel Larionov) met Sergei Diaghilev and Alexander Benois in Paris in 1914, who initially  suggested that Goncharova should design Fokine's ballet Le Coq d'Or.  \nShe continued to paint throughout her life but became best known for the designs she produced for theatre, opera and ballet. \n\nThe costume has been attributed to the character of a Knight, possibly in the service of the evil Kostche\u00ef whom Prince Ivan defeats with the help of the Firebird. Thereby rescuing the Princess with whom he has fallen in love.",
