It forms part of a series entitled The Cube: Theme and Variations (T.V.C.). The three dimensional effect is produced by repeating a small number of characters, some of them in a bold typeface.\n\nZajec studied painting in Ljubljana, Slovenia, then at Ohio University, in the United States. He started to use computers in 1968, at a time when he was experimenting with the concept of redundancy in his paintings.  He returned to Italy in 1970 and worked at the University of Trieste. In 1980 he moved back to the United States, where he founded the computer art programme at Syracuse University. \n\nZajec has created and exhibited many computer graphic works, plus interactive projects and digital films. He took part in the ground-breaking Tendencies 4 exhibition in Zagreb (1968 -9) and also showed five works from the T.V.C. series in Tendencies 5 (1973).",
