            "public_access_description": "Giovanni Antonio Canal called Canaletto (1697-1867) was born in Venice and trained there by his father, Bernardo Canal, a theatrical scenery painter, and his uncle, Cristoforo. He accompanied them to Rome where he remained a few months, maybe more, and directed his artistic development towards view paintings including fantasy views and landscapes while gradually working his way into realistic view painting. He was a member of the Venetian painters' guild, the Fraglia, in 1720. He moved to England in 1746 and remained there until at least 1755, a sojourn interrupted by short visits to Venice. He trained his nephew, the view painter Bernardo Bellotto (1721-1780), who became a member of the Fraglia in 1738, and perhaps Michele Marieschi (1696-1743) and Francesco Guardi (1712-1793). He also had a certain influence on the English school of painting, especially Samuel Scott, and had established the vogue for views of London. \n\nThis painting is an early 19th-century copy after an engraved composition by Canaletto, dated 1735-46, just before his departure to England. It shows a palace designed by Jacopo Sansovino (1486-1570), which housed the national library (Biblioteca Nazionale Marciana) and the ancient Mint (Zecca) while the base of the Campanile is at the far right. Very close to Canaletto's art of painting, this composition documented the early 1740s topography of Venice as well as the lifestyle of the Venetian society.",

Before 1800,</u> London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, p. 54, cat. no. 56.\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"Giovanni Antonio CANAL called CANALETTO (1697-1768) \n<i>Italian (Venetian) School</i> \nBorn in Venice the son of a scene painter and designer, Bernardo Canal, he began his career as a scene painter. He went to Rome in 1719-20 and shortly afterwards turned to view-painting, strongly influenced by Luca Carlevarijs (1663-1730), whom he soon surpassed in public esteem. He worked much for English patrons, above all, from 1730, for Joseph Smith later British Consul in Venice, and he lived in England from 1746 to 1753 and again in 1754-56. He was belatedly elected to the Venetian Academy in 1763 and died in Venice in 1768. \n\n<i>Lit.</i> W. G. Constable, <i>Canaletto</i>, 1962\n\n\nAfter CANALETTO\n \n56 \nVENICE: THE PIAZZETTA \n<i>Canvas</i> \n18\u00bd x 29 (47 x 73.6) \n549-1870\n\n549-1870 is one of a pair with 557-1870 (no. 57). Both were acquired as by Canaletto (1893 <i>Catalogue</i>, p. 176); they are in fact derived from two etchings in a series made by Canaletto for Consul Smith c. 1744 (R. Pallucchini and G. F. Guarnati, <i>Le acqueforte del Canaletto</i>, 1945, nos. 15-6; Constable, <i>Canaletto</i>, p. 599, nos. 15-6). The two copies probably date from the first half or middle of the 19th century. \nThe composition of 549-1870 recurs in a painting by a follower of Canaletto formerly in the P. C. Mead Collection, Southampton (Constable, <i>loc. cit.</i>) and it was also copied by Francesco Guardi (Vienna, Academy of Fine Arts; M. Goering, <i>Francesco Guardi</i>, 1944, fig. 40). There are fewer figures in 549-1870 than in the Canaletto etching, but otherwise it is identical. \n\n<i>Prov.</i> John Parsons; bequeathed to the Museum in 1870.\"\nR.

            "history_note": "Bequeathed by John M. Parsons, 1870\nJohn Meeson Parsons (1798-1870), art collector, was born in Newport, Shropshire.  He later settled in London, and became a member of the stock exchange.  His interest in railways led to his election as an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1839, and he was director or chairman of two railway companies between 1843 and 1848.  Much of his time however was spent collecting pictures and works of art.  In his will he offered his collection of mostly German and Dutch schools to the National Gallery (which selected only three works) and to the Department of Science and Art at South Kensington, later the Victoria and Albert Museum.  The South Kensington Museum acquired ninety-two oil paintings and forty-seven watercolours.  A number of engravings were also left to the British Museum.\n\nHistorical significance: Originally attributed to Canaletto, this painting forms a pair with 557-187. It is probably a copy made in the first half of the 19th century after an etching by Canaletto of around 1735-1746 (impression in the British Museum, London, 1838,0526.4.15). \n\nThis view of the Piazza San Marco in Venice shows the Library of St. Marks designed by Jacopo Sansovino (1486-1570). On the far left is the corner column of the Basilica of San Marco and the pedestal from which proclamations were read (piera del bando). On the far right is part of the base of the campanile (Loggetta)   In the distance, a puppet theatre near the column of S. Teodoro entertains a small crowd of people.\n\nThe scene is depicted bathed in bright sunlight with a restricted palette of brown, white and blue enlivened by touches of red in the costume of some figures. In comparison with the etching, some figures are missing, a group of people sitting around a table are substituted with fewer standing figures, and the chimney tops above the palace no longer appear.",

            "historical_context_note": "Giovanni Antonio Canal, known as Canaletto (1697-1768), was born in Venice, where he trained under his father, Bernardo Canal, a theatrical scenery painter, and his uncle, Cristoforo. He briefly visited Rome in 1719-20, and shortly afterwards turned to view painting, strongly influenced by Luca Carlevarijs (1663-1730). He became a member of the Venetian painters' guild in 1720 and spent the years 1746-55, with interrputions, in England. His nephew and pupil was the view painter Bernardo Bellotto (1721-1780). Michele Marieschi (1696-1743) and Francesco Guardi (1712-1793) may also have been his students. He worked much for English patrons, and was influential upon English painters such as Samuel Scott. Canaletto's pictures were widely copied from the 18th century by artists including Antonio Joli and William James. \n\nA 'veduta' is a painted, drawn or engraved composition representing a landscape or a town, largely topographical in conception. These were particularly popular during the era of the Grand Tour. Such painters were known as 'vedutisti' and sometimes employed a 'camera obscura', a box with a small hole used as an optical device, to capture effects of scenery. The 'veduta' eventually succumbed to the invention of photography.",
