Smith was particularly interested in life in London: he was also responsible for The Cries of London, published in 1839, after his death. The 'Cries' of London were originally the calls of street traders and hawkers selling their wares. They became a rich source of inspiration for British musicians and artists, particularly in the 18th and 19th centuries. Vagabondiana fits into this tradition, and the inclusion of real-life black personalities reflects the historical presence of many black men among the London poor, and the fact that this was recognised in mainstream publications of the time.",
