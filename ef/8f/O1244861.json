Stannard reproduced the grain and warmth of a wooden door with a subtle surface and sophisticated use of the patina. Pierced and made of two parts, this piece breaks the traditional boundaries of the medal; it is a thoughtful reflection on the possibilities of a two-sided object.",

            "history_note": "This medal was bought from the artist in 2012, when it was shown at the V&A as part of \u2018The New Medallists,\u2019 a display celebrating the first six years of the New Medallist scheme. An initiative run by the British Art Medal Society (BAMS), this scheme is designed to breathe new life into the tradition of the art medal by nurturing a new generation of medallists. Phoebe Stannard (born 1987) was the BAMS New Medallist in 2009/10.\n\nStannard works in a variety of media. She trained as a painter at Norwich School of Art, and observational drawing is firmly rooted in her practice. She takes pleasure in both printmaking and medal-making, for she finds great enjoyment in process-based artforms.\n\nIn her medals, Stannard considers the possibilities opened up by shape and the manipulation of the object.  With <i>Under Lock and Key II</i>, the keyhole binds the two sides of the medal together, like the slits of the Japanese tsubas that inspired the artist at the time she created this piece.  Subtle patina and particular attention to textures are combined to almost replicates a door lock. The medal refers to the distressing experience of being locked out of one\u2019s room for \u2018the drama is contained within the small appendage of the key: as if shrunk by magic, it is too short; rendered useless, it cannot turn.\u2019 (Leavitt Bourne and Vandenbrouck-Przybylski, 2012, p. 44)",
