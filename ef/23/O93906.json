Below the front is a portion of a carved spandrel at one side; the corresponding spandrel at the other side is missing.\n\nBoarded oak chest with geometrical panels of ornament on the front, on raised feet. With one spandrel attached to the front right foot (with loss). The back and lid (elm) replaced. With an iron lock (replacement) and iron lid hasp to match, with the square blank area originally intended for a lock visible underneath. Originally fitted with a till (proper right). With reinforcing oak strips nailed to the PL foot (inside face) and across the top of the PL end (to counter warp). The front has a wider left hand vertical border than the right side (58 vs 13mm), while the lock plate is centred at 55cm from the left end, suggesting that either the carver mis-measured his work, or that the right end has been cut down. \nNote \u2013 although there are 3 empty holes where the front is nailed to the left end (possibly evidence of refixing), the nail and peg fixings appear to be original to the chest, and both ends contemporary. Its possible that the front was cut down (by 45mm) and reused to make a slightly smaller chest, but perhaps mis-measurement by the carver, or less good timber at the right end (that needed to be cut back) of the front is a more likely explanation. \n\nThe front nailed and pegged (from the front) into the ends and floor.\nThe bottom of one riven plank, and one sawn. The ends (20-22mm) plain sawn (fast growth) and the front quarter sawn (24-25mm). The lid held on two split ring hinges\nWith traces of reddish and white pigments over the front, and a large fern motif on the left end. The back panel with clear pit-saw marks.",
