He also produced costumes for fancy dress and period balls, which were a feature of social life in the 1920s and 1930s.  This wreath may have been produced for such a ball, maybe the famous Chelsea Arts Ball, a famous, somewhat bohemian, annual event at which the guests vied with each other to wear the most extravagant or outrageous costumes.  \n\nMessel was always creative in his use of materials, and to make this wreath needed no 'real' gold metal or chased decoration.  The leaves are stiffened paper, with wire stems which are fixed onto a wire circlet bound with brown paper tape, the whole painted to simulate gold or bronzed metal. \n\nGreat Britain\u2019s leading theatre designer from the early 1930s to the mid 1950s, Oliver Messel (1904-1978) won international acclaim for his lavish, painterly and poetic designs informed by period styles.  His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.",

However, a viewing of the film confirms that no such wreath appears in the film nor is there any obvious scene in which it might have been used.  It is as likely that it was made for a costume ball or a project that was never completed.  \nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's remaining designs and artefacts (many designs were sold or given away during the artist's lifetime).  The collection was briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being placed on indefinite loan to the V&A Theatre Museum from 1981.  The Oliver Messel Collection was purchased from Lord Snowdon in 2005 with the aid of the Heritage Lottery Fund, The Art Fund and the Friends of the V&A.",
