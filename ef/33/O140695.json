It is important as an early panorama made by the calotype process -a paper negative process invented by William Henry Fox Talbot in 1839. \n\nCalvert Jones, who took this photograph, was introduced to photography by a cousin of Talbot and by close friends, who lived near to Jones in South Wales. Jones' work stands out in the early development of photography because of his ability to fuse his new skill in photography with his experience as a watercolorist. He may have seen a watercolour of this view painted by Samuel Jackson of the Bristol School of Artists.",

F Talbot's photographic discoveries in the late 1830s through Talbot's cousin and friends who lived near to Jones in South Wales. Jones subsequently became one of the few Britons to produced a substantial body of calotypes in Britain and abroad. His work stands out in the early development of photography because of his ability to fuse his technical skill with the influence of his training as a watercolorist.\nThis photograph is one of a two part panorama showing both sides of a steep cobbled street with a commanding view over the centre of Bristol. It was a view that Calvert Jones may already have seen depicted in another medium. Samuel Jackson, an eminent watercolorist of the Bristol School of Artists, painted Bristol from St Michael's Hill in 1824 (Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery).",
