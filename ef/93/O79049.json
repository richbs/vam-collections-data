Later brackets, dating from the 1730s, were designed to take busts and so were more bulky. The delicate structure of this example indicates that it would not have supported anything heavier than a porcelain vase. \n\nTime \nThe fashion in Britain for rooms bedecked with Chinese porcelain was established by Mary II who reigned from 1688 to 1694. The Queen was an enthusiastic collector, who adorned her private apartments at Kensington Palace, London, and Hampton Court, Middlesex, in this way. From 1703 the court architect, Daniel Marot, published a series of engravings showing small private rooms, or cabinets, decorated with porcelain. The walls bear a profusion of jars and vases, many of them placed on similar brackets.\n\n Ownership & Use\nThe bracket formerly belonged to Percy Macquoid, the eminent furniture historian of the early decades of the 20th century. His most famous works are The History of English Furniture (1904-1908) and the Dictionary of English Furniture (1924-1927), which he wrote in collaboration with Ralph Edwards, who later became Keeper of the Furniture Department of the V& A. These remained the two standard works on English furniture until the 1950s.  The latter publication included an illustration of this bracket as a particularly fine example of furniture of a highly sought after period.",
