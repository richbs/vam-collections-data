The pole is wrapped with a leather band at the point at which it sits under the staples on the body of the sedan chair.\n[Carrying pole] Carrying pole of soft wood varnished reddish brown.  Handles at each end curve under and are tapered with fluting on the sides. The pole is wrapped with a leather band at the point at which it sits under the staples on the body of the sedan chair.\n[Sedan chair] The exterior of the sedan chair is covered with dark red leather.  There are three windows, one in the door and one either side.  Brass round-headed studs are arranged in decorative patterns around the windows and follow the outline of each side of the chair, at the same time forming a girdle round the chair about half way up; they are mainly arranged in groups of six and nine.  The mouldings of the window frames are of serpentine form, of wood carved, gessoed, gilded and painted with a Regence pattern. The painting and oil gilding has been renewed by the Museum.  The glass in each of the windows, all replacement, is set in amovable wooden frame, painted green.  The front window is made to drop downwards, into the body of the door on a strap punched with several holes that can be hooked onto a tack attached to the inside of the chair door just below the window.The window strap is stamped and gilded and may be an early 19th century replacement. The side windows slide back, and the glass in these two windows is protected by two thin metal horizontal wires. \n\nAt each side of the chair near the base are two iron brackets, back and front, to accommodate carrying poles.  The roof, the shape of a shallow umbrella, has eight radiating struts, which are also decorated with brass studs arranged in rosettes.  The four corners of the roof are upturned into a scroll formed of laminated leather, the back right-hand one of which is bent over. Immediately below them are carved wooden female masks, painted.  Behind each corner scroll, on the roof, is a brass finial, triangular in section. The central finial is a replacement, of carved wood, made by the Museum in 1968. The whole roof is surrounded by large brass studs, and below is a carved wooden cornice, with gadrooning and scrollwork. \n\nThe interior is, except for the floor, lined with pale olive green (perhaps once saffron yellow) stamped woollen velvet on a linen warp, with a floral design with a very large repeat. The seat has 22 inch width, the standard width for a handloom.   There are two small padded arms rests.  These and the base of the padded seat, below the windows, and at the base of the roof are trimmed with pale olive-green fringing, probably of mercerised cotton, of cord with floss tassels, and braiding 1.6 inches wide, in linen woven with a diamond pattern. . The stuffing of the seat is probably horsehair. Under the seat the walls appear to be relined at the back and sides.The velvet on the underside of the roof is held in place by nailed tapes and the pattern is not symmetrically placed.  The wooden floor has a leather mat, nailed in poisition with brass-headed nails in a decorative pattern of symmetrical scrolls. This is much worn and the red leather outer covering of the sedan chair is torn in places on the door.   \n\nExternally, the back of the chair curves inwards at the base to allow space for the rear carrier to walk. On the back there is an arched panel of repaired leather.\n\nThe frame of the chairs is probably poplar, which is a light wood to carry, with some walnut. It is of crate-like construction, with the visible coverings stretched between the framework. Parts of the wood panel of the seat have been renewed.",
