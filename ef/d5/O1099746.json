Her husband, Henry Priestman (buried 23 April 1712), was the 'Wollendrapper corner of Henrietta Street Covent Garden', recorded by Vertue. (1) On her marriage she brought with her the exceptionally large cash dowry of \u00a32,000. Henry purchased the contents of Samuel Cooper's house from the widow when she moved from Henrietta Street to the parish of St Giles-in-the-Fields in about 1673, and he took on the house itself when his father-in-law Christopher Rosse left it, his 'Mansion House', to Mary on his death in October 1701.
