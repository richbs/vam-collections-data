Krohn-Hansen and R. Kloster (Bergens Gullsmed Kunst, vol ii, pl 99). A cup of this form, which originated in the 16th-century, was the prescribed test for admission to the Bergen guild until 1758 ... The absence of marks on this piece suggests that it may be a 'master-piece' rather than a cup for guild use. A cup ceased to be the prescribed form for aspirants to the goldsmith's guild in Bergen in 1758, when a Copenhagen workman, Anthony Bredenbeck, insisted on presenting a coffee-pot, as was customary in the Copenhagen guild and elsewhere in Norway and Denmark. After the guild had refused to accept this domestic article in place of the traditional ceremonial cup as evidence of skill, Bredenbeck appealed successfully to the royal authorities in Copenhagen and with their assistance was admitted into the guild. After this, insistence on a cup ceased. The Bergen guild seems to have clung to the cup as a useful means of restricting admission since it was too expensive and too useless an article for the ordinary journeyman to make.\nThe Rococo style of which there are elements in this cup was introduced into Bergen in the early 1740s. The Berain style which is dominant in the cup was brought to Bergen around 1704 by Johannes Reimers the Younger, who is known to have used engravings by Daniel Marot.'\n\nShape follows that of Nuremberg/Augsburg masterpiece cups",
