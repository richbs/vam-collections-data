Craig reacted against the stage realism of his day, believing that painted scenery and a naturalistic interpretation of characters distracted attention from the essence of the play. His designs, most made for productions which never took place, were simple and non-illusory. They were characterised by towering vertical masses and were intended as a background for actors who would subordinate themselves to the drama. It was the beginning of what came to be called Director's Theatre, in which director and designer offered a strong co-ordinated interpretation of each work.\n\nOne production which did take place was Hamlet at the Moscow Art Theatre in 1912. In 1908 Constantin Stanislavsky, the theatre's director, invited Craig to direct and design Shakespeare's play. This photograph shows Craig's model for the final scene, made in 1909.",
