In designing the Vilstolen, he sought to create a modern chair which was based on the position of the sitting body. He brought his considerable practical experience to this design problem, having been an apprentice in his father's cabinet-making firm for most of the 1920s.  Without stuffed upholstery, he addressed the challenge of comfort by forming the seat from bands of woven hemp, an idea which he adapted from the underbelly belts used to secure saddles. The chair is also remarkably light having been made from a laminated and bent birch frame. \n\nAlthough Mathsson's anthropomorphic design and use of natural materials is widely credited with tempering the severity of Modernist design, the Vilstolen has a clear relationship to other contemporary Modern movement designs including those by Alvar Aalto (cats.164, 218, 219). With a stable frame, economical use of materials and small number of parts, Mathsson's chair shares many of the principles underlying the design of contemporary tubular steel furniture.\n\nMathsson's designs of this period enjoyed a great deal of attention. He was given a one-man show in 1936 at R\u00f6hsska Konstsl\u00f6jdmuseet in G\u00f6teborg in 1936 and his work was well received at the Paris Exposition Internationale des Art et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne in 1937. Nevertheless, he struggled to find a manufacturer willing to take on his design and so the family firm continued to make the chair in its own workshops in the postwar period, when it was adopted as a powerful icon of Swedish modern design. \nD.C.
