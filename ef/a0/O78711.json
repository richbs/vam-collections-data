The silver-gilt original is not marked but is probably the work of a continental silversmith working in the 1750s.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe development of the electrotyping process whereby works of art could be accurately reproduced reached its peak in Britain in the 1860s and 1870s. Certain approved commercial firms, such as Elkington & Co. and Franchi & Sons, were given access to hitherto inaccessible private collections so that moulds of the individual works of art could be taken, and copies produced from them. The royal collection at Windsor was one of these collections.\n\nTrade\nThis is one of a series of electrotypes - mostly of English wares - copied by Franchi & Sons in 1868. Electrotypes were frequently used for educational purposes. They would be mounted in box-frames and sent round art schools for students to draw or copy. The museum also sold electrotype copies of works of art on a commercial basis. This perfume burner was for sale in the 1880s at the comparatively high price of \u015325.",
