This is one of over 100 wallpapers that Pugin created for the Houses of Parliament. Many of these wallpapers were designed for specific rooms - in this case for the Royal Gallery. \n\nDesign & designing\nThe Museum also has the original watercolour design for this wallpaper, signed and dated 1850 [museum number D.791-1908]. In a pattern book of wallpapers supplied for the redecoration of the Houses of Parliament, examples of this paper are labelled as 'Exhibition Pattern', which suggests that it was shown in the Medieval Court at the Great Exhibition in 1851. The design is clearly influenced by the patterns of cut-velvet textiles from the 15th and 16th centuries.",
