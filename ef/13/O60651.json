The supportive corner cabriole legs dispensed with the need for stretchers between the legs and created more room  for the seated players. From about 1711 to 1750 the form of the card table changed very little.\n\nOwnership & Use\nCard tables opened up when required for use in the front parlour of the terraced house, or the drawing room or saloon of the grander metropolitan or country house. Four players can comfortably sit with their legs under the table and play cards without revealing their hands to each other.\n\nSocial Class\nCard games were played by the upper and middle classes for education, amusement and money. The small sunken well on each side of the table could house the coins won by each player.Cards were the chief evening activity, as lighting was often too poor to read for long after dark. Cards were used for instruction in a wide range of subjects. Knowledge of the rules of fashionable games was taught in the mid-18th century by gaming masters. George II and Queen Caroline were devoted card players, the king's favourite game was 'commerce' and the queen's 'quadrille'.",
