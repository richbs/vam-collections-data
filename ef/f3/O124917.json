It initially consisted of a series of six tapestries, and was first woven in 1688, with the cartoons produced by Jean-Baptiste Monnoyer, an artist principally known for his still-life and flower paintings. \n\nThe Grotesques series was enormously successful, woven many times, with many variations, through to 1732  (there are more than 150 surviving pieces of varying quality, corresponding to the descriptions of 'fine' and 'ordinary' grotesques that appear in the archives of the factory). Based on the classical grotteschi of the 16th century artist Raphael, as adapted by Berain, they show fragile architectural constructions resting on slender columns of lapis-lazuli, and filled with playful figures, and exotic animals and birds. The compositions included animal tamers, an elephant, a camel, musicians, dancers, and acrobats, together with offerings to the Gods Pan and Bacchus. These elements could be brought together in different combinations, with a variety of different borders, to create a composition customised for ornament, size and price.",
