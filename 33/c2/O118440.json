The design comes from a group of designs that were part of a retailer's archive which employed professional embroiderers. The names of the female clients inscribed on the designs were of the aristocracy, gentry or from wealthy families that moved in the upper reaches of society.  They had homes in the country and came to London for the season.  Retailers who sold such designs were linen drapers and lacemakers, both of which categories existed in London and were available to the clients. Many pattern drawers worked in London where their trade proved a lucrative business during the season. The similarity of some of the designs from this group to those by Styart, whose designs were published in London, does support the argument that these designs came from a retailer's archive based in London.",

            "history_note": "The designs were bequeathed to the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1973 by Raymond Johnes who had 'enormous and miscellaneous collections'.*  Johnes' collection included Japanese art, on which he published,** Indian and European material.  He did not specialise in collecting textiles although he owned some examples.  He was in contact with the Museum 1920s-1970 offering to sell objects from his collection.  Johnes did not provide the Museum with information about the history of ownership of the designs. \n\n*Mr B.W. Robinson, former Keeper of the Far Eastern Department, V&A, in a letter to Mr Ayres, Assistant- Keeper in the same Department, V&A Regsitry, nominal file, (MA/1/J479).", 
            "place": "London", 
            "production_note": "The design comes from a group of designs that were part of a retailer's archive which employed professional embroiderers. The names of the female clients inscribed on the designs were of the aristocracy, gentry or from wealthy families that moved in the upper reaches of society.  They had homes in the country and came to London for the season.  Retailers who sold such designs were linen drapers and lacemakers, both of which categories existed in London and were available to the clients. Many pattern drawers worked in London where their trade proved a lucrative business during the season. The similarity of some of the designs from this group to those by Styart, whose designs were published in London, does support the argument that these designs came from a retailer's archive based in London.  \n\nThe design is probably for a border to a petticoat. It would be a large pattern for an apron. The draped shape of the 'intestine' and the sprouting grass-like plants are similar to the draped ribbon, from which emerge trios of feathers or fern plants, in the other designs in this group E.265-1973 and E.266-1973.  This suggests that they may have been drawn by the same pattern-drawer or an assistant in the same workshop.  The grass-like plant can be compared to corn motifs in a pattern book in the Fulneck Moravian Museum collection, Yorkshire.  Jocelyn Baker illustrates numerous patterns from this pattern book and she states that in whitework embroidery made by the Moravian Settlement that 'corn was a recurring motif on collars, baby clothes and aprons'.  The dates of some of the patterns are later (1810-1825) than those in this group.  Baker dates them by linking the accounts of a Moravians' client, Mr Evans of Bond Street, London, to designs from the pattern book.  Baker discovered that the Moravians drew their own patterns from evidence at the Fulneck Church and Museum Archives.  I am not suggesting that some of these designs, analysed in this project, were drawn by Moravians but their designs and workshop practice can be used as comparisons.\n\nThe inscription 'Mlle' is short for Mademoiselle.  This could be the signature of a lacewoman who sold embroidery.  Anne Buck stated that Madame Beauvais, the mantua-maker and milliner, 'may have been French or simply have adopted a French name,' suggesting that this was a practice in this type of trade.  A. Buck, Dress in Eighteenth- Century England, (Batsford, London, 1979), p.162.  Alternatively, Mlle. M could be the name of a client who was a French refugee from French revolutionary France during, or after, the date of the French Revolution in 1789.",
