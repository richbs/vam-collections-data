A local architect Pringle carried out the work commissioned by Moss Empires so that the building could accommodate the patrons of the Empire Theatre Newcastle which was being rebuilt. The original Olympia in Newcastle, basically a corrugated iron hall, opened in December 1893.  It was reconstructed again in 1908 after a fire, closed in 1960 and demolished in 1971. \n\nThe evening's Variety entertainment was pretty standard fare for the day, a mixture of comedy, dancing, juggling, 'hoop manipulation', a short comic play by Donaldson Brothers and Ardel, and in keeping with many Variety Theatres at the turn of the century, a short piece of cinema or 'American Bioscope' showing the Boer Generals arriving at Southampton.",
