There he met Fortnum and together they: \u2018called upon Lombardi the silversmith who has a shop on the Ponte Vecchio and lives near the Pitti Palace. He has a very interesting collection of early gilt background pictures and also some fine other things ... I made a bargian with him for the most splendid knife made for a family called Rovere. The handle is silver-gilt with 6 little bas-reliefs of most exquisite workmanship and ascribed with every appearance of truth to Pollaijuolo - for this, an early cross with silver enamels and an armoire with intasiatura, I made a bargain for 2150 francs, according to the value of the fine silver work in the Bernal Collection the knife alone is worth \u00a3100.\u2019 The cross [5414-1859] and the knife [5415-1859] are still in the Museum\u2019s collection. ... Francesco Lombardi was following in the tradition of the Ponte Vecchio, where the shops have been occupied since the sixteenth century by goldsmiths.\u201d",
