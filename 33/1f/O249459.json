One of these papers (\u2018Spray') was not designed by Morris, but was produced by the firm and was based on an earlier paper removed from a house, 'Palace Ann', near Brandon, County Cork, and given to Morris by Charles C. Townsend, architect, in 1866. (Information found on the backs of photographs of the house by Miss Caroline C. Townsend, daughter of the architect.)\n\n'Scroll', <i>circa</i> 1871 (E.3698); 'Branch', <i>circa</i> 1871 (E.3699); 'Trellis', 1864 (E.3700-3703); 'Diaper', <i>circa</i> 1868-70 (E.3704); 'Indian', <i>circa</i> 1868-70 (E.3706-3709); 'Fruit', 1862, produced 1864 (E.3710-3712; E.3710 neg GJ.9636); 'Spray', <i>circa</i> 1871 (E.3713, 3714; E.2807 neg GJ.9661); 'Venetian', <i>circa</i> 1868-70  (E.3715-3717); 'Daisy', 1864 (E.3718, 3720); 'Queen Anne', <i>circa</i> 1868-70 (E.3721, 3722).'\nParry, Linda, ed. <u>William Morris</u> London : Philip Wilson in association with the Victoria and Albert Museum, 1996. Published to coincide with an exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum, 9 May-1 Sept. 1996, p.206.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows: \n\n'<b>L.2</b> Wallpaper sample, <i>Daisy,</i> 2 \nDesigned by William Morris, registered 1 February 1864 \nPrinted by Jeffrey & Co. for Morris Marshall, Faulkner & Co. \nBlock-printed in distemper colours, 68.6 x 50.0 cm \nV&A (E.442-1919) \nGiven by Morris & Co. \n\nAccording to Mackail (p.156), <i>Daisy</i> was designed after <i>Trellis</i> but published first. There is no attempt to dress up the repeat of the simple pattern with its free-standing clumps of meadow flowers on a grass-like ground. Nevertheless, <i>Daisy</i> was one of the most consistently popular of the firm\u2019s papers, still selling well nearly fifty years after it was issued. \n\nThe first three wallpapers - <i>Trellis, Daisy</i> and <i>Fruit</i> - were all, from an early date, offered on a light, a medium and a dark ground. Further colourings were added later. This colourway was called <i>Light Daisy</i>. \n\nThe source of the pattern can be seen in a wall hanging illustrated in a fifteenth-century version of Froissart\u2019s Chronicles (BL Ms 4380, fol. 1). The hangings embroidered for the bedroom at Red House, 1860, used similar flower groups though on a larger scale (cat.No.M.6).' \n\n\u2018Mackail\u2019 refers to: Mackail, J.
