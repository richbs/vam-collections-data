It is interesting to note that the piece was ordered by a Manchu, a member of the Plain White Banner.  Jichang (d.1829), from the Baidu clan, alias Shuzhi, had given himself a studio name Chending Xuan.  He also did what many of his Han colleagues had done, namely to have porcelains made for his personal use while he was Provincial Administrative Commissioner in Jiangxi during the years 1826-1828.  Besides this flask he also ordered small cups painted with a scholar under pine trees in underglaze blue.  A lidded cup painted with figures in the doucai style is reported to have the same mark but is not illustrated.",
