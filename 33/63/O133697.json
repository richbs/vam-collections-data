Trained as engraver with his father, then at Trustees Academy. Exhibited 45 works (including two engravings) at the RSA between 1833 and 1870 (elected Honorary Member 1887), seven at the RA 1842-69, nine at the BI 1841-65, and four at the SBA 1840-2. Subjects were historical, literary and biblical. London 1837, entered Westminster Hall competition 1843, Master of Government School of Design, Newcastle, 1843-63. Influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites and friend of Rossetti. Major works are series of paintings for Wallington Hall, Northumberland 1856-61, and Penkill Castle, Ayrshire, 1865-8. Published five volumes of verse, editions of major poets, several books on art, and <u>Memoir of David Scott</u> (1850). Died Penkill Castle 22 November 1890; Swinburne wrote memorial verses. \n\nLIT: <u>Athenaeum</u> 29 November 1890, p745 (obit); <u>Illustrated London News</u> 6 December 1890, p710 (obit); <u>Blackwood's Magazine</u> CLIII, February 1893, pp229-35; ed W Minto <u>Autobiographical Notes of the Life of William Bell Scott..</u>. 2 vols, 1892 \n\n\n<b>A Picnic at Hanwell </b>\nP34-1963 Neg FD2055 \nCardboard, 22.8 X 30.5 cm (9 X 12 ins) \nInscribed 'Hanwell Sep'. 1841' br \nGiven by Miss Sylvia Gosse 1963 \n\nA label, once stuck on the back, is inscribed perhaps in the artist's hand: 'John Bell Scott & wife/William Bell Scott & wife/Dr George Napoleon Epps/& wife Charlotte Epps/Sep 1841/J B S poet & W B Scott painter/painted by the poet's brother' (last four words overwritten in a later hand 'by W B Scott'). John Bell Scott is not mentioned among the family in the<u> Autobiographical Notes</u>, nor does any of his poetry appear to have been published. George Napoleon Epps (1815-74) is not mentioned either, but in the <u>Autobiographical Notes</u> Scott records in about 1850 that he and his wife were annual guests of the half-brother, also a homeopathic doctor, Dr John Epps, in whose house he met his wife, Laetitia Margery Norquoy (I, p255); Mrs John Epps recorded that her husband knew David Scott in Edinburgh in the 1820s and later became friends with William Bell Scott in London (ed Mrs Epps <u>Diary of the late John Epps ..</u> 1875, pp142-3). \nThe manuscripts in the foreground are titled ?'Somne', 'The Grandchildren', and 'The Day of Four Stories'; these do not seem to be the titles of any published poems by William Bell Scott, and presumably, in view of the inscription quoted above, relate to his brother's unpublished work. \nHanwell, Middlesex, is just north of Osterley Park; the river meadows there were a favourite local beauty spot. \n\nEXH: <I>Artists as Collectors</i> Leicester Galleries 1963 (81, lent by Sylvia Gosse) \n\n\nRonald Parkinson",
