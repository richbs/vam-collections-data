Each Saxon god is traditionally associated with a day of the week, and Sunna represents Sunday. The figure was lost for many years and only rediscovered in 1996. The Saxon gods are tied in with the political iconography of Stowe, and symbolise Lord Cobham\u2019s allegiance to the ideals of those Whigs who had broken away from Sir Robert Walpole. As such they represent an ancient British identity.\n\nRysbrack was born in Antwerp, and trained in the Netherlands, but spent his working life in Britain. He was one of the most important sculptors active in this country in the first half of the 18th century, and specialised in portrait busts and funerary monuments. Although he never visited Italy, many of his works are clearly indebted to classical prototypes.",
