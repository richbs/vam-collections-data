This paper was inspired by chintz fabric (printed or painted cotton) of a similar date. It was common practice in the 18th century for wallpapers to be made with matching paper borders. Borders were useful as well as decorative. They covered the heads of the tacks or nails used to fix the paper to the wall, and they also gave a neat finish to the papered wall, covering any joins or non-printed areas at the edges. This paper must have been damaged at some date, because a piece has been cut out and another section of the same design pasted in.",
