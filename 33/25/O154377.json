At the same time, one sees the subtle but rich and varied texture of the surfaces - so characteristic of his steel knife blades. Simple in form and outline, the decorative richness of this server lies in the complex Japanese metalworking technique of mokum\u00e9 gan\u00e9. The process involves the bonding of various metals and alloys, resulting in decorative wood grain effects. Baldwin combines a modernist appreciation of simplicity with a traditional technique that has been in use for some three hundred years. Past and present are united in this unusual reassessment of a very functional form.",
