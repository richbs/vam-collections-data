The play is a farce set in a psychiatric clinic, which is reflected in the irreverence of the poster itself, a photo-collage designed by director Lindsay Anderson. This was a reference to Orton's own interest in collage; Orton and his partner Kenneth Halliwell served six months in prison after they spent a period in 1962 for defacing library books stolen from Islington libraries to make collages.\n\nWhat the Butler Saw was Joe Orton's last play, and was not produced in the West End until 1969 at the Queen's Theatre, two years after Joe Orton was murdered by Kenneth Halliwell. The original production had a star cast including Ralph Richardson, Stanley Baker and Coral Brown, but the play was not well received by the critics who dismissed it as filth. The play's reputation was not restored until this 1975 revival at the Royal Court, directed by Lindsay Anderson.",
