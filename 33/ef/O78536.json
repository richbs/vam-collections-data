Characteristic elements include the use of simple bold forms such as the three straight, spike legs and the straight handle, attached to the body by bridging struts rather than being shaped and attached directly to the body (a feature directed adapted from Japanese precedents).\n\nMaterials & Making\nDresser was inspired by the Japanese tradition of juxtaposing different metals and 'mokume' (a mixed metal sandwich forged to give the appearance of wood grain) but as the British hallmarking laws prohibited the mixing of gold and silver with base metals, experiments in combining metals were reserved for copper, brass and iron.\n\nDesign & Designing\nDresser's most innovative designs were for objects to be made in metal.  Unlike his designs for ceramics and glass which often resemble plant forms in their shape, ornamentation or colouring, his metalwork designs tend to be fully abstracted from their organic source, frequently employing symmetrical, rectilinear shapes and undecorated surfaces.",
