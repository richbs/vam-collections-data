A bronze floral brocaded silk is inserted at the centre back of the neck, and faces the right cuff. The left cuff is faced back with blue brocaded flowered silk. The front facings and skirt are lined with blue glazed linen, and the upper part of the back with natural linen. The sleeves are lined with the same, but at the wrist this is overlaid with red cotton printed with an undulating interlace in white and shaded with the same, and the right cuff has an additional band of red cotton printed with a small rectangular floral design. Similar but not identical cotton with a larger scale floral design has been used to face the neck. A waist-band of woven blue and white tape is stitched at the centre back waist to tie in front, and the same tape at the neck is used for a hanging loop. The jacket is hip length, shaped to the waist with a seam at the back waist from which flares a short stiff pleated skirt. The front is unwaisted but flares towards the hips, fastens from the medium low neck to waist with four heavy black wire hooks and eyes. The sleeves are long, gathered at the shoulder, wide at the upper arm and tapers towards the wrist where they are trimmed with a gilt fringe.",
