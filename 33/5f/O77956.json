After about 1800 these became heavier to allow for the expensive, deep, and often complex wheel cutting that characterised the Regency Style.\n\nPeople\nIn 1806 the Prince of Wales made a grand visit to Liverpool. This visit effectively endorsed that wealthy city's association with the contentious slave trade. In gratitude to the Prince, the Council ordered a huge suite of table glass for him from the local manufacturer Perrin, Geddes & Co. of Warrington. When it arrived, the Prince thanked them for 'the most beautiful and ornamental specimens he ever saw of this valuable manufacture'.\n\nIt seems probable that for such an extremely expensive service, which took over a year to make, other craftsmen may have been involved. The local glass-cutter John Unsworth, who styled himself 'Manufacturer to His Majesty and to His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales', may have been one.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe unparalleled design of this decanter is so sophisticated that it has often been attributed to a London glass specialist such as John Blades, who we know employed architects as designers. The superb, lustrous lead glass itself, however, and the dramatic deep swirling cutting, are certainly attributable to Warrington. In terms of European cut glass, the Prince of Wales service must rank as one of the most astoundingly successful blends of material, design, and faultless technique.",
