Fundamentally they were just a cone on a small foot, but these objects were so ideal for their purpose that they were produced from about 1700 to at least 1845. They differed in details which often are noticeable only to specialist collectors.\n\nRetailers & Trade\nThe component parts of a pyramid of jelly glasses could be bought from a glass dealer as a complete kit, or as separate items - all being likely to need regular replacement through breakage. Pyramids of jellies remained fashionable at the end of the 18th century, while individual jelly glasses (often now with elaborate cutting which would in no way match the pyramid of free-blown salvers) were also used separately on the dessert table.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThis example successfully combines the virtues of economical mould-blown ribbing as well as the sophistication of a scalloped-cut rim and a faceted foot.",
