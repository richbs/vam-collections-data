It has a bent soundboard, with an elaborately decorated pick-guard, bridge and pins to keep the strings in position at the bottom. But it also has six pairs (or 'courses') of strings like the Milanese mandolin, and its rose is made up of layers of decoratively cut leather like a Baroque guitar. \nThis example is probably an early 'Neapolitan' mandolin, which may have been played with a pick but tuned like the 'Milanese' version and therefore rather like a guitar.",
