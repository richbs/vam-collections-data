Princess Louise, the last child of the deposed King James II is depicted in profile. \nThe medallion is likely to have been made by the Dieppe sculptor Jean Mancel (Mansel). He was active in 1681-1717. Little is known about Mancel, a Hugenot ivory carver, who was recorded as a citizen of Amsterdam in 1681, and who from 1687/8 was in Maastricht. He was also active in England as a portraitist. The medallion is closely similar to an ivory medallion portrait of Queen Mary II, also attributed to Mancel. The representation is probably after a medal by Norbert Roettiers (ca. 1665-1727).",
