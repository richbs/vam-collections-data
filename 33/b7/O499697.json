He was a member of the \u2018The Algorists\u2019, a term coined in 1995 to describe a set of artists, who, since the 1960s and 1970s, had been working with a shared interest in the use of bespoke software for generating art using the computer.\n\nThis drawing was created by Verostko for a work entitled \u201cPsalms in Sound and Image\u201d, which synchronised a sequence of projected images of Verostko's work with a sound track. The sound track and slide sequence signals were programmed by the artist using an electronic synchronizer and a Wollensak recorder, and are the earliest example of his programmed work.",
