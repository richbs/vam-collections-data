During the Gothic revival, Herbert Minton developed techniques for producing inlaid tiles in medieval style, which went into production at Minton and Co. from the 1830s. \n\nThe tiles were created by pressing malleable 'plastic' clay into a mould. The mould left impressions on the surface of the tile, which were then filled with coloured liquid clay before the tile was dried and fired at high temperature.\n\nHeraldic patterns were popular designs, and they were sometimes produced on commission. The design on this tile is the Arms of Wentworth.",
