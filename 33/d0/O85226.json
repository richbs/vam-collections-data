ISBN 1851773088.\nThe Museum's collecting of contemporary textiles was carried out with a knowledge of earlier traditions. For Circulation Department curators in the early 1950s who had researched the origins of English printed textiles, or \"chintz,\" this Lucienne Day Calyx design was an obvious candidate for acquisition. Unlike most modern chintz, which revived nineteenth-century floral patterns, the Day design was a bold and forward-looking pattern that had already influenced other designers.\nCalyx was created specially for a room designed by Lucienne's husband, Robin Day (English, born 1915), in the Homes & Gardens Pavilion in the 1951 Festival of Britain. The Festival of Britain showcased examples of both abstract designs and traditional floral chintzes. This design, in which the stylized floral forms (the calyx or fruiting body of a flower) appear almost completely abstract, typified the prevailing trend for nonrepresentational patterns. Its painterly style reflects the influence, acknowledged by Lucienne Day, of Paul Klee and Joan Mir\u00f3. Calyx won a gold medal at the Milan Triennale later in 1951, as well as the International Design Award of the American Institute of Decorators in 1952, the first time a British designer had won this award. In the United States, the fabric was sold to over two hundred leading designers through Greeff Fabrics Inc.\n\nLit. Harris, 1993\n\nCHARLES NEWTON",
