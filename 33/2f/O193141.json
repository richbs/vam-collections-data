The National Liberal Party is a longstanding Romanian political party founded in 1864. Its activity was suspended during the communist leadership in Romania and the party was re-established at the beginning of 1990. During the 1990 elections, no electoral threshold was set and, under these circumstances, 27 political parties gained seats in Parliament. The headline of the poster, 'Liberty. Prosperity. Wellbeing', indicates the aspirations of a society carrying the scars of 50 years of social and political adversity under communist rule. The arrow represents the logo and electoral sign of the National Liberal Party.",
