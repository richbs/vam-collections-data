Steele-Perkins chose to focus on the curious intersection of rural life and post-industralism in former mining communities, looking in particular at man\u2019s relationship with animals (pigeon clubs, feretting, lamping, greyhounds), and producing a body of work of exemplary black and white reportage . What he found was not the \u2018rural England I grew up in [in Somerset], of cider, soft rolling hills and warmer weather\u2019, but a way of life that still maintained links with \u2018an older, mainly Anglo-Saxon England.\u2019 As the photographer writes \u2018I wanted to document these ways, and rituals of a life lived in the open, under the sky. This is what these photographs are: a partial record, and a personal exploration, which serves as both eulogy and elegy.\u2019",
