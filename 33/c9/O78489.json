When this is pulled, the clock strikes the last hour on the bell and the nearest quarter past it on six bells of different tones.  The escapement, crown-wheel and pallet are modern replacements.  The clock is signed twice, with the one on the rear plate  accompanied by the number '36803'.\n\nHistorical Associations\nThis clock came originally from the well-known dealer and horologist Percy Webster, who claimed that it had once belonged to Catherine the Great, Empress of Russia (1729-1796).\n\nDesign\nIt has been suggested that the very fine silver-gilt mounts may be after designs by G.M. Moser (1706-83).\n\nMaker\nJohn Ellicott (1706-1772) was the most famous member of a distinguished family of clockmakers.  He took over his father's business in 1733 and was in partnership with his son from 1757.  He supplied clocks and a terrestrial globe to the Spanish royal family.  In the apartments of Queen Maria Cristina at the Palacio Real, Madrid, is a table clock signed by Ellicott which has very similar silver-gilt mounts.",
