            "public_access_description": "This poster was designed by design duo Michael English and Nigel Waymouth, known as Hapshash and the Coloured Coat. In the late 1960s they created psychedelic posters for many of the English bands of the time, and decorated and advertised Nigel Waymouth's King's Road boutique, Granny Takes a Trip. They also designed for concerts held at the UFO club and Saville Theatre, and for underground magazine Oz. Their influences came from the decorative and eroticised designs of Art Nouveau, combined with the melting rainbow colours of LSD visions and pop art inspirations from the post-war media; traces of Disney, horror movie monsters and comic book characters and can often be seen hiding amongst the images.\n\nThe Jimi Hendrix Experience were an English-American psychedelic rock band that formed in London in October 1966. Comprising singer-songwriter and guitarist Jimi Hendrix, bassist and backing vocalist Noel Redding and drummer Mitch Mitchell, the band were active until June 1969, in which time they released three successful studio albums. Jimi Hendrix died in mysterious circumstances in September 1970. Redding died in 2003, and Mitchell became the last original member of the band to die in November 2008.\n\nWidely recognised as a band hugely influential on the development of hard rock and heavy metal in the 1970s and beyond, The Experience were arguably best known for the skill, style and charisma of frontman Hendrix, who has been noted as one of the greatest guitarists ever by various music publications and writers.",
