            "public_access_description": "This print was one of a series of 16 published by the catering company J. Lyons & Co Ltd. Originally intended to decorate Lyons' tea-shops, they were soon in demand by people keen to enliven the post-war dreariness of their own homes. Lyons subsequently reprinted and sold them to the public. Like other artists in the scheme, Freedman was a popular contemporary artist and gifted illustrator. This image is a typical example of his sensitivity to his subject-matter and the medium. He helped pioneer a revival of colour lithography, which became popular with companies such as Shell-Mex and BP Ltd, the General Post Office and the BBC for their advertising campaigns in the 1930s and 1940s.",
