Seed pods sprout at the knots. The whole is oxidised. The dark grey metal coloration contrasts with the variegated greens, browns and whites of the champ levee enamelling, the scarred pitted surface, and the insect depredation convey the emotion of the decrepitude of the dying leaf. The underside of the leaf blade, unfortunately not easily seen, is a riot of champ levee decoration in these same tones. The server lies at rest on its side. It invites inspection, and suggests that concept and not function were the motivating concerns of the artist. This, despite the narrow sharp bevel of the left side to provide a cutting edge.",

One senses the emotional interaction of the maker with her creation that prompts - forces - this freedom of expression and her need to express herself with this eye-catching work.
