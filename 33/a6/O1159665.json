The plot is based on the medieval legend of Genevieve of Brabant. In English-speaking countries it is known for the \"Gendarmes' Duet\", from H. B. Farnie's 1867 English adaptation.\n\nThe two-act French libretto was written by Louis-Adolphe Jaime and Etienne Tr\u00e9feu, and the opera was first staged at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Bouffes Parisiens, Paris, on 19th November 1859. A new three-act version, revised by Hector-Jonathan Cr\u00e9mieux, was first given at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Menus-Plaisirs, Paris, on 26th December 1867. This version added a comic duet for bass and baritone in the character of two gendarmes to Act 2, titled, \"Couplets des deux hommes d'armes\". A final expanded five-act version was devised for a production at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Ga\u00eet\u00e9 on 25th February 1875. \n\nAlthough this costume is labelled as 'page' it may resemble a disguise worn by Drogan, who is in love with the heroine Genevi\u00e8ve and begs her to accept him as her page. This would also explain why this page appears to be a woman as the role of Drogan was originally sung by a soprano (it has been sung by a tenor since the creation of the revised, five act, version).\n\nThe print is part of the Harry Beard Collection.",
