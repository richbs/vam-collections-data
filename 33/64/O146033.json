            "physical_description": "This set contains four vessels for oil, vinegar, salt and pepper. The stand is a flat rectangular sheet of steel with semi-circular ends; the turned over rim forms the edge on which the stand rests. The upper surface of the base plate is decorated with a textured surface, imprinted on to the steel sheet which gives an effect of slight relief and hides possible imperfections caused by manufacturer. The handle is a single sheet piece of steel wire attached to the centre of the base plate. It extends vertically and is bent in the form of a continuous, triangular loop at the top to serve as a carrying handle. Four circular wire loops are attached near the base of the carrying handle grouped in diametrically opposite pairs which serve as holders for the glass vessels. The loops for the salt and pepper shakers are squat, cylindrical, glass vessels with the upper and lower rims recessed; the upper has a thread for the cover while the lower rim nestles in the loop of the holder. The oil and vinegar bottles, one of which is taller than the other, are narrow cylindrical bottles which are slightly waisted in the centre. The bases are flat and rest on the steel tray of the holder and the tops have extruded, nylon pourers. All vessels have a stainless steel, domed cover with a narrow rim. Those for the salt and pepper shakers are perforated.",
