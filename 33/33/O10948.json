A matching tea kettle is in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Richmond, Virginia.\n\nStyle\nA standard baluster form of pot and cover has been transformed by elaborate and fantastical marine decoration characteristic of the flamboyant Rococo style The form of the finial and of the spout is composed of boldly-modelled cast elements, also on a marine theme.\n\nDesign Sources\nMuch of the decoration is taken from ornamental engravings by the celebrated French designer Jacques de Lajoue (1686-1761). The sea-horse is from his Second livre de cartouches, published in Paris in 1734, while the dolphins and boat are based closely on  a design from the Recueil nouveau de differens cartouches,  also of 1734.  The sea-horse motif that appears on both the coffee pot and the tea kettle also forms part of the decoration of the enamelled porcelain service made in China for Leake Okeover (1701-1765) around 1740. The goldsmith who made this pot, James Shruder (active 1737-49), unusually designed his own trade card, and he was probably responsible for the scene depicting Poseidon with his trident.",
