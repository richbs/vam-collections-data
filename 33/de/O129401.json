He spent much of his life on pilgrimages, and here he is depicted with a staff.  Whilst in Piacenza he caught the plaque and was fed by a dog.  The dog is sometimes used as one of his attributes, but it is missing from this representation. St Roch was reputed to have miraculously cured plaque sufferers. \n\nSt Sebastian was believed to have been a Roman martyr who suffered persecution during the reign of the emperor Diocletian.  Sebastian was believed to have been a soldier who became captain of Diocletian's praetorian guard, without Diocletian realising that he was a Christian.  Sebastian helped other Christian martyrs, for which Diocletian ordered him to be shot to death with arrows.  Sebastian recovered, confronted the Emperor for his cruelty, and was then beaten to death with clubs.  The representation of St Sebastian clad only in a loin cloth, bound and pierced with arrows became popular in the fifteenth century. St Sebastian was the patron of archers, but also had a widespread patronage against the plague, partly due to Sebastian's courage in facing torment and suffering.",
