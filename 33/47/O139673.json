It functioned both as a sunshade and a fashionable accompaniment to dress, distinguishing itself from the umbrella through its infinite and luxurious forms and essentially feminine status. Like the earlier trend for fans parasols displayed an individual's style and could be used in a coquettish ritual to hide the modest bearer from unwanted glances.\n\nWith more covered automobiles and the new vogue for sun-tanned skin, the 1920s were the parasol's swansong. Elaborate and novel designs flooded the market in an attempt to win back interest. This bold design has 16 ribs supporting its cover as opposed to the standard 8 and is flat when fully opened, a style revived in the 1870s, and reminiscent of much earlier Japanese designs .The single piece of Tussore silk is printed with a bright Aztec-style pattern, the look is completed with a thick pistol-butt handle, a clear move away from the delicate femininity of the 19th century.   Characteristically for this period it is short in length, approximately half what was typical in the previous decade.",
