It was made for a play called 'Orvet' by Jean Renoir, who was Caron's great friend and mentor.  He wrote it for her, and also directed it.  It was first performed at the Theatre de la Renaissance, Paris, on 12 March 1955.  \n\nAlthough this dress was worn on stage, it is a couture quality creation. The dress and jacket are made from heavyweight wool with moir\u00e9 silk panels in the skirt, and must have been very warm during the performance.",
