It was shown by the maker at the International Exhibition of 1862, where it was purchased by the Museum for \u00a33 4s. \n\nThis inexpensive necklace was made with rather poor quality lapis lazuli which led experts in the past to believe that it was an imitation of the real stone.\n\nOn the reverse of the five circular medallions of lapis lazuli are classical heads in intaglio which were probably by Gueyton's modeller Justin. Gueyton is known to have experimented with electrotyping (forming a facsimile of an object with the use of electricity ) and the heads may have been produced in this way.",
