It is signed and dated 1660, the year of the Restoration of Charles II. One side shows General Monck facing right, the other has a commemorative inscription.\n\nPeople\nGeneral George Monck (1608-1670) at first supported Charles I, but then fought for Oliver Cromwell during the Civil War. At the end of the Protectorate, he played an important role in the restoration of Charles II and was created Duke of Albemarle.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThis medal was cast in gold after a wax model. A cast (probably in plaster) would have been taken from the original wax model. This in turn would be used to make a plaster mould. Molten gold would be poured into the mould to make a series of medals.",

            "historical_context_note": "The two brothers, Abraham Simon (b London, 1617; d ?1692) and Thomas Simon (b London, 1618; d London, 1665), were among the most outstanding medallists of English birth before the 19th century. Abraham worked for Queen Christina of Sweden and in Holland before returning to England ca. 1643. He was a skillful wax-modeller, as revealed by his self-portrait in that medium (London, BM). \nIn 1645 he was appointed jointly with his brother Engraver of Coins and Seals at the Royal Mint. From around this time they produced many cast and chased portrait medals of distinguished contemporaries. According to Vertue (1780), the medals were cast from Abraham's wax portraits; they were then chased and often signed by Thomas. However, the possibility that Abraham's role also included casting and chasing is suggested by the appearance of his initials on some of the medals. Moreover, as Thomas was an ardent Parliamentarian, it is unlikely that he was involved in the production of those medals that portray noted Royalists. \nMany of the medals thought to be collaborative efforts are of a particular size; they have no legend accompanying the portrait on the obverse, and a reverse consisting solely of a horizontally placed inscription. The earliest of these are either unsigned or signed by Abraham. Signed examples include the medals of John Campbell of Lawers, 1st Earl of Loudoun and William Pope (both 1645) and those of Albert Joachim, Sir Sydenham Poyntz and John Maitland, 2nd Earl of Dunfermline and Charles Seton, 2nd Earl of Lauderdale (all 1646).\nAbraham continued working throughout the period of the Commonwealth: he produced a medallic portrait of Henry Cromwell in 1654. After the Restoration, he modelled a wax portrait of Charles II, but his personality became increasingly difficult, and, failing to obtain commissions, he ended his days in obscurity. \n\nPhilip Attwood: \"Simon\" Grove Art Online.
