The upper part of the roof, which is star-shaped with several tiers rises to a pointed finial summit, is detachable and is much simpler in style than the main part of the shrine, lacking its elaborate ornamentation, yet fits exactly into the space made for it in the top of the lower section of the roof on the main part. In the main part of the shrine on each of the two outer faces of each column there is a figure of a flywhisk bearer low down, a diamond shape above him with an inscription in devanagari above that and, at the top, a female dancer, totalling eight flywhisk bearers, eight diamonds, eight inscriptions and eight dancers. There are also garland bearers at the corners of the arches. The eyes of the flywhisk bearers and the elephants on the roof have been inlaid with silver, and there is also a small piece of silver inlay in the middle of each of the diamond shapes on the outer faces of the pillars.",

The twenty-four Jinas venerated by the Jains are also known as Tirthankaras or ford-makers. The figures on the pillars carrying fly-whisks reflect the intended presence of the image of a sacred being. The shrine would probably have been made for a caumukha or four-faced Jina, composed of four Jinas placed back-to-back, each one facing outward towards an open archway. Such images were used in full-size Jain temples in the four-doored, caturmukha plan with the Jinas facing in the cardinal directions. This small shrine would have been used either for a domestic altar in a wealthy home or, perhaps more likely, in a Jain temple. This shape is recommended for use in domestic shrines by a Jain text, and it is also seen in portable shrines, although wood is the preferred material for these.\nThe celestial dancers, flywhisk bearers, elephants and cusped arches springing from the mouths of monsters are all common features of Jain temples and shrines. The flywhisk bearers indicate the intended presence of the image of a sacred being and the use of silver inlay reflects the care lavished on the ornamental detail of this example. The detachable roof section, however, is much plainer in style. It fits perfectly into the space in the main shrine, though, so it was clearly made for this shrine, although it is not known whether it may have been a replacement for an earlier roof.",
