It is decorated on the front with five square pastes, alternating green and red (two missing), in fluted mounts, and on the side with one larger drop-shaped green paste.  There is a ring below each of the square pastes from which hang the pendants.  Each pendant consists of a closed hollow cone with repousse arabesque decoration.  The central pendant ends in a facetted green glass bead, and the others each had a small pearl, only one of which remains.  There is a loop above the paste on the side of the hoop which holds a compact loop-in-loop chain ending in a heart-shaped plaque with arabesque engraving set with three pastes, one orange and two green.  There is a long hook attached to the top of the heart, and two conical pendants ending in red glass beads hanging from its lower edge.",

The ornament is formed of an open hoop decorated with five drop pendants. The hoop is attached, by means of a chain, to a heart-shaped pendant set with coloured glass and with two further drop pendants. The heart-shaped piece would have been hooked onto a headdress with the hoop hanging from it at approximately ear level. The most decorative part of the hoop could be seen from the front.\n\nThe Museum of Ornamental Art (later the Victoria and Albert Museum) purchased the pair at the \u2018Exposition Universelle\u2019 in Paris in 1867. The series of international exhibitions held between 1852 and 1900 provided the Museum\u2019s curators with key opportunities to acquire contemporary manufactures.",
