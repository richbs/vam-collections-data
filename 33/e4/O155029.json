Through this medium the designer conveys a subdued, sombre effect.  Designers used to be taught not to use blacks on stage, because they can create a 'black hole' - an area without highlights or shadows - but a skilled designer knows how to use black and vary texture and subtle shading.  The fabric samples show how Alison Chitty achieves her effect - using a black fabric with a lurex pattern to suggest the watered silk of the voerskirt, which she has drawn with such subtle precision.  Another fabric incorporating lurex gives enough life and subtle sparkle to the costume, so that the third fabric can be a heavy black, just the kind of fabric designers were taught not to use.",
