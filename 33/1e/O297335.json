            "physical_description": "[Longcase clock] The clock is contained in a large mahogany case that is glazed on all four sides. The case divides into two sections: in the upper quarter the dial and movement are held under a hood; the bottom three-quarters of the case house the mechanism. The base of the case is formed as a rectangular plinth. Each of the case\u2019s four main panels of glass finishes in a curved arch below the dial. The top of the hood is also arched. The hood is glazed on all four sides.\n\nThe four projecting corners of the case are adorned with brass Corinthian columns. These columns are topped with gilded brass mounts of lion\u2019s heads. Around the bottom of the case is a gilded brass frieze. The heads of the hood arches at front and rear are mounted with female masks in gilded brass. \n\nThe clock\u2019s movement sits behind a white enamel dial. The movement can be seen through the glass panel at the rear of the hood. The movement has a dead-beat escapement and a bar-balance beating 30 to the minute. This is driven by a weight which hangs on an endless loop of chain. The movement\u2019s weight is wound using energy from the barometer in the lower part of the case. \n\nThe barometer tube and bowl are suspended from opposite ends of rocking levers. As atmospheric pressure changes, mercury moves between these vessels. This causes the barometer tube to rise and fall. The barometer tube is connected, via a rod, to a set of wheels that power the clock\u2019s movement. The barometer keeps the clock going continuously.\n\nThe barometer bowl is held in place by curved brass straps. The straps on either side of the bowl are engraved respectively \u2018Weeks\u2019s Rl. Museum\u2019 and \u2018London 1806\u2019.\n\nA number of changes appear to have been made to the clock during its history. A 1796 engraving of the clock, produced in connection with Cox\u2019s Lottery, shows it without the lion\u2019s head paterae now seen below the hood. In the engraving, the clock is also shown with an elaborate mount on the top of the hood, where the female masks now sit. When the clock was acquired by the V&A it was topped with a gilded brass eagle. The vase that currently sits on top of the hood was made to correspond to a vase seen in the engraving.",

            "history_note": "[Longcase clock] Made by James Cox and his chief mechanic, Joseph Merlin, in the 1760s. \n\nJames Cox worked largely as a jeweller and goldsmith, and was most famous for his production of automata. Working from London premises on Shoe Lane, he developed a large export trade in automata in the 1760s, designing elaborate pieces for sale to India, China and Russia.\n\nJohn Joseph Merlin came to England from Belgium in 1760, having already trained as a mechanic. Merlin appears to have worked as Cox\u2019s principal mechanic from the 1760s until around 1772. Describing himself in patent applications as a mathematical instrument maker, Merlin most likely worked for Cox building the mechanisms for complex automata, as well being a clock- and watch-maker.\n\nThe clock was first recorded in an edition of the catalogue of Cox's Mechanical Museum dated 1773 (Guildhall Library, Pam 6546, no. 47). In January 1774 it was inspected by James Ferguson, a lecturer in natural philosophy, who described it as ' [...] the most ingenious piece of mechanism I ever saw in my life.' A description of the clock also appears in the 'Annual Register' for 1774 (vol. 17, p. 248).\n\nFrom 1768 to 1774 the clock was exhibited in Cox's own museum of automata in Charing Cross, London. The museum was dispersed by lottery in 1775, and by 1796 the clock was on display in Thomas Weeks's Royal Mechanical Museum in Titchbourne Street, London. It remained there until 1837. There is a gap in the history of the clock between 1937 and 1898. In 1898 it was exhibited at the Clerkenwell Institute, recorded as the property of W.F.B. Massey-Mainwaring. In 1921 the clock was bought by a Mr. R.G. Carruthers in Edinburgh and placed by him on loan in the Laing Gallery, Newcastle on Tyne. It was sold by auction in London and bought by Messrs Blairman.\n\nThe clock was bought by the V&A from Blairman and Sons in 1961, with the assistance of the National Art Collections Fund.",

            "historical_context_note": "[Longcase clock] There was a dramatic increase in the precision and number of instruments of physical science in the eighteenth century. Prompted by the quantifying cultures of enlightenment Europe, new and more accurate instruments such as barometers, thermometers, telescopes, chronometers and theodolites were developed by scientists and amateurs throughout the century. The development of these instruments was often sponsored by state initiatives, as well as scientific institutions such as the Royal Society. Cox and Merlin\u2019s clock sits very interestingly within this culture of scientific experiment, partly because of its highly-publicised use of so-called 'perpetual motion'. \n\nThe pursuit of perpetual motion was a recurring interest for eighteenth-century European scientists. In the early part of the century, a number of high profile experiments were held in an attempt to create a mechanism that would perpetually propel a wheel. [1]  From the middle of the century, the idea of perpetual motion was frequently raised in association with attempts to regulate navigational devices and allow for accurate navigation of the southern hemisphere.\n\nCox and Merlin\u2019s clock achieves a kind of perpetual motion, in that it does not need winding. This is done by cleverly adapting an existing eighteenth-century technology. The clock is powered by a barometer-like mechanism which moves mercury between two large jars in accordance with changes in atmospheric pressure. The force of the movement of mercury through the clock\u2019s glass \u2018pendulum\u2019 translates, via a series of wheels, into a rotary movement on the dial. \n\nA basic form of this technology had been in use in barometers since the mid-seventeenth century. Mercurial barometers became common in interiors of the 1680s onwards, where they were often adopted as part of a contemporary amateur and gentlemanly interest in science. Enclosed in decorative cases, these mercurial barometers held a middle ground between scientific instrument and fashionable furniture.\n\nCox and Merlin\u2019s perpetual motion clock offers an exaggerated version of this eighteenth-century interest in the domestic and decorative display of science. The clock\u2019s case, with its gilded mounts and vast scale, is an imposing and ornate structure. It mirrors and enlarges the basic form of contemporary English long-case clocks, but here the pendulum is replaced with a very visible scientific mechanism. In looking at the clock, all attention is focussed on the movement of mercury between the barrels of a lavish, sweepingly-curved glass mechanism.\n\nThe display of the clock in both Cox\u2019s and Thomas Weeks\u2019 Mechanical Museums fits it into a distinctive late-eighteenth century history of exhibitions. Cox\u2019s museum, while only open for around 7 days, caused a sensation in 1770s London with its display of luxury mechanical goods. After leaving Cox\u2019s business, Merlin established his own version of the museum in the 1780s. Merlin\u2019s Mechanical Museum was a fashionable destination for Regency Londoners, exhibiting mechanical instruments, automata, and \u2018patent\u2019 furniture such as his famous mechanical chair, featured in <i>Ackermann\u2019s Repository</i> in October 1811.[2]  Merlin\u2019s long-standing exhibition, widely advertised in late eighteenth-century London papers, probably provided the model for Thomas Weeks\u2019 display rooms. \n\nIn its design and exhibition history, Cox and Merlin\u2019s perpetual motion clock brings together contemporary science and luxurious visual spectacle. As such, it is an object that reflects and extends the multifaceted curiosity of scientific instruments in late eighteenth-century London.\n\n<u>Notes</u>\n\n1.
