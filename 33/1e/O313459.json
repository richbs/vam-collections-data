            "public_access_description": "This reduced copy of the seated figure of Carlyle was apparently made by Boehm at the request of the sitter. Following the death of Thomas Carlyle in 1881, a bronze replica of the statue of Carlyle was erected on Chelsea Embankment in 1882.\n\nBoehm (1834-1890) was an English sculptor and medallist born in Austrian, as the youngest son of Joseph Daniel Boehm (1794\u20131865), a court medallist and director of the Imperial Mint at Vienna. From 1848 to 1851 Joseph Edgar attended Leigh\u2019s art academy (later Heatherley\u2019s) in London and drew the Parthenon marbles in the British Museum. On his return to Vienna he enrolled at the Akademie der Bildenden K\u00fcnste. Around 1858\u20139 he visited Italy, where he developed a lasting admiration for early Renaissance sculpture. From 1859 to 1862 he worked in Paris and was influenced by the work of Paul Gayrard (1807\u20131855). Boehm settled in London in 1862 where he befriended John Leech and John Everett Millais, both of whom he portrayed in statuettes in 1863. A statuette of William Makepeace Thackeray (1864) led to an edition of 70 plaster casts. Boehm frequently worked in terracotta, a material common in French sculpture but less familiar in English. Queen Victoria\u2019s admiration of Boehm\u2019s statuettes led to an association with the royal family that lasted from 1869 until his death. Most of Boehm\u2019s works are portrait busts. Boehm was immensely prolific: some 360 different works are documented. He was a highly consistent sculptor, rarely deviating from his brand of realism. He was modest about his immense popularity and aware of his imaginative shortcomings (cit.: M. Stocker: 'Boehm, Joseph Edgar').\n\nCarlyle (1795-1881) man of letters, essayist and historian, was born in Ecclefechan, Dumfries and Galloway. Son of a stonemason, he studied at Edinburgh University, and taught for several years, before beginning to write articles for the Edinburgh Encyclopaedia, and becoming absorbed in German literature, notably Goethe. In 1826 he married Jane Baillie Welsh (1801-66). His best known work, 'Sartor Resartus' appeared in 1833-4. He then moved to London, where he wrote his other major works on the French Revolution (3 vols, 1837) and Frederick the Great (6 vols, 1858-65). In 1866 his wife died, leaving letters and a journal showing her to have been one of the most accomplished women of her time. After her death, Carlyle retired from public life, and wrote little.",
