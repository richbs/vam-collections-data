The text is based on that in 'Masterpieces in Japanese Prints, The European Collections: Ukiyo-e from the Victoria and Albert Museum' (London: V&A. 1991), p.141. I am unsure about copyright issues. Catherine David, 14 May 2004.\n\nThe enormously influential Utamaro (1750-1806) brought to the genre of figure prints a special insight into female psychology. This surimono (privately commissioned woodblock print) is a good example of his early work showing graceful women depicted with a fine, careful line. In particular, the facial expression of the girl who has just finished playing the koto (13-stringed Japanese zither) and the upper body of the woman rolling the blind show Utamaro's skill at delicate detail. The scene is probably based on some story, but in general it shows two popular leisure activities during the Edo period: playing musical instruments and holding parties for viewing plum or cherry blossoms.",
