The surfaces apart from the enamelled areas of the lids have been given a textured finish.  The larger box has straight sides with the two front corners rounded, the two smaller boxes similar except the front wall is a semi-circle.  All three boxes rest on a continuous recessed rim which is of squared wire.  The lids sit flush with the sides and are supported on a recessed rim, similar to the foot.  The exposed rim for each lid is continuous along the back wall.  The thumbpiece is an additional section of square wire attached to the front rim which sits in a cut out section of the leading edge.  The interiors are lined with antelope suede, dyed black.  The lids are decorated with three horizontal bands of enamel, alternating in colour.  The middle band is gradated, dark blue enamel, translucent over a textured ground which gives an impression of watered silk.  Either side of this band are bands of opaque, white enamel.",

It is the work of Gerald Benney (b.1930), a distinguished British silversmith and industrial designer. From the 1960s his designs were often formal and geometrical and occasionally included the use of deep lustrous enamel, as shown here. His enamel work developed from his contact with Berger Beigersen, a master Swiss enameller.\n\nBenney started his own workshop when he graduated from the Royal College of Art, London, in 1955. By 1957 he was a consultant designer to Viners of Sheffield, a major producer of base-metal hollow ware and flatware at that time. During his career Benney successfully combined working as a practising silversmith and an industrial designer, with each discipline enriching the other.",

He persuaded him to come to Beenham House, Berkshire, to advise on enamel techniques and thus the slow process of reviving a virtually extinct craft was started.  As the skills were learned, so the experiments began - not only with the enamel but with the construction of the silver and the formulae for the solders.  By 1971 transparent enamels in red blue and greenwere perfected and items began to be commissioned by patrons not only in England but also in France, Switzerland and North America.",
