The lining is undyed linen; approx. 14x14 tpc; plain weave; z-spun. The back of the lining/cap edge has been slightly squared off with the addition of a couple of triangular pieces of linen (while the outer layer at this point has been cut to fit). At the end of the squared off area, on either side, would have been ties. A portion of one tie remains. It is undyed linen and approx. 12mm wide. At the central join of the lining there are two lines of running stitch on either side, which may not meet the end of the cap's edge. The outer layer of the cap is made of a undyed linen with silk embroidery. The pattern is of lines of joined, geometric icons. The icons are small, central diamonds, with the upper and lower points joining up with other lines and the side points ending in swirls. The rows alternate blue, pink and brown. The cap is hemmed with a small (4mm wide) band of red silk. The cap is damaged on one side and stained, with holes. A different linen has been stitched to the damaged side in an attempt to hold it together.",
