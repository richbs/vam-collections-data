The saucer, which is so big it seems more like a dish, has no indentation for a cup. It would have been displayed at a viewable angle, not placed under the cup to obscure the printed design.\n\nHistorical Associations\nThis set was one of many commemorative items available for visitors to buy at the Crystal Palace, as a souvenir of what must have been an exciting day out. Commemorative wares were produced on a commercial scale from the 1780s and by the 1820s, transfer-printing on earthenware and porcelain had become a staple part of the pottery industry. During the Victorian era, many notable events and significant dates in the royal calendar were rendered as transfer-prints on souvenirs.\n\nPeople\nBoth pieces are marked underneath by the retailer, 'Green, London'. This was James Green of 35-36 Upper Thames Street, who, prior to 1840, had been a partner of Bacchus, the Birmingham glass manufacturer. The diamond mark under the saucer indicates that the design was registered by Green on 20 January 1851.",
