L\u00e9onide Massine who choreographed the ballet and wrote the libretto and Ottorino Respighi wrote the music which was based on piano pieces by Gioachino Rossini. The costumes were designed by the French artist Andr\u00e9 Derain (1880 \u20131954).\n\nThe story of the ballet has similarities to Die Puppenfee (\"The Fairy Doll\") and Hans Christian Andersen's The Steadfast Tin Soldier. The ballet centres on the love story between two can-can dancer dolls in a toy shop who come to magically to life when the toy shop shuts for the night.\n\nIn the original performance Lydia Lopokova and Massine played the roles of the can-can dancing dolls with Enrico Cecchetti as the shopkeeper.",
