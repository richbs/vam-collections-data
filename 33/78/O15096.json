Webster individualizes each character and contrasts each member of the group 'before and after' the excursion; for example, the youngest child is first out of the door riding its 'hobby-horse', but, tired out, is last home, while the eldest daughter has brought home a young man.",

Chorister in Chapel Royal, entered RA Schools 1821, winning gold medal 1824. In a long and successful career, exhibited 83 works at the RA between 1823 and 1879, 39 at the BI 1824-44, and eight at the SBA 1825-34. Early pictures were portraits and historical subjects, but following success of 'Rebels Shooting a Prisoner' (showing children at play) 1827, specialised in similar scenes, and of school and village life, comparable to those of Wilkie and Mulready. Influential and much admired, they became popular through engravings. Elected  ARA 1840, RA 1846, and Honorary Retired RA 1876. \nContributed illustrations to the Etching Club's 'Deserted Village', 'Songs of Shakespeare' and 'Etch'd Thoughts' (1841-4). Moved to Cranbrook, Kent, 1856; senior member of the Cranbrook Colony of painters. Died Cranbrook 23 September 1886; his studio sale was at Christie's 21 May 1887. \nLIT: Art Journal 1855, pp293-6, 1862, p138, 1866, pp40, 330, 1886 \npp351-2 (obit); Athenaeum 2 October 1886, p439 (obit); The Times 24 September 1886 (obit); DNB\n\nReturning from the Fair \nFA221 Negs HE4630, 59102, CT14379 Panel, 55.9 X 76.1 cm (22 X 30 ins) Signed and dated 'T WEBSTER. 1837.' br Sheepshanks Gift 1857 \nWith its companion 'Going to the Fair' (see FA220) painted for a Mr Flood, and exhibited at the BI in 1838. It shows the same family, with the addition of a young man the eldest daughter seems to have brought home; particularly well observed is the youngest child - eager to be first out of the house but tiredly returning last. The device of 'before and after' pairs of paintings became increasingly popular with 19th-century genre artists such as Abraham Solomon ('First Class - the Meeting' and 'Second Class - the Parting' (RA 1854), and 'Waiting for the Verdict' (RA 1857) and 'Not Guilty' (RA 1859)). Webster exhibited a different composition with the same title at the RA 1837 (276; sold Sotheby's Belgravia 29 June 1976, 61 X 50.5 cm (24 X 19314 ins), dated 1836). \nEXH: BI 1838(30) \nLIT: \tG Waagen Treasures of Art in Great Britain 1854 II, p302; Sheepshanks Gallery \n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
