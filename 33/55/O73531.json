During the company's short life span, until 1757,  it fulfilled only a few orders and was dismantled due to the Seven Years' War. In 1756 two ships, Koning (or Prinz) von Preussen and Burg von Embden, arrived with a fifty-nine piece dinner service with 20 pieces designed with a shaped rim. Numerous pieces had been damaged during the voyage and, instead of being presented to the king, were sold.",
