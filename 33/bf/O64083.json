The Jina's eyes and the auspicious srivatsa mark on his chest are inlayed with silver. Behind is head is a radiant halo and he sits on a bejewelled cushion. The upper section of the shrine is in an arch shape with a finial on top. Within the arch and directly above the Jina is a 3-tiered umbrella. Flanking the umbrella are two elephants and below each of them another, much smaller, meditating Jina. The mouth of very stylised crocodile-like makara aquatic monster may be seen on each side at the bottom of the arch. Below the makara heads are two figures, probably flywhisk bearers, flanking two standing Jina figures. Underneath the Jina's cushion and forming part of his throne are a pair of lions. They are flanked by two seated figures in the posture of royal ease, with one leg crooked up. Below these figures are two more seated meditating Jinas and between these two figures the metal is pierced with four complex cross shapes. The lowest level is also pierced with pointed arch shapes. The details of all the figures have been considerably smoothed away over time and the brass-like copper alloy is presumably quite soft. On the back of the shrine is an inscription.",

            "public_access_description": "This is a Jain altarpiece with an enthroned image of a Jain saviour, or Jina, seated in meditation at its centre. Jainism is an ancient Indian religion with non-violence as one of its key tenets. An inscription on the back enables the Jina to be identified as Suvidhinatha, the 9th of the 24 Jinas, who are also called 'Tirthankaras' or ford-makers as, according to Jain belief, they show the way by which people can ultimately escape from life's cycle of birth, death and rebirth and achieve liberation. The inscription also dates the image to Friday, 23rd March, 1464 and explains that the image was caused to be made by a person named Ulaka through the Jain monk Dhanesvarasuri. Jains, who had many followers in Gujarat and Rajasthan in Western India, gained religious merit, which would help in their future rebirths, by having such images made and donating them to temples and many such shrines have similar inscriptions. This enables some of these medieval objects to be precisely dated. The image is of copper alloy but important details of the shrine such as the eyes and the auspicious srivatsa mark on the chest have been picked up with silver inlay. As well as the main image of Suvidhanatha there are two figures of other Jinas seated in meditation on either side of his head and two more at the base of the shrine, while a further two Jinas standing in the kayotsarga or 'body abandonment' pose flank the main image. There are elephants, suggesting royal or sacred status, at the top, lions supporting Suvidhnatha's throne, and at the top above the Jina an honorary umbrella. Ceremonial flywhisk bearers at the sides flanking the two standing Jinas. Such elaboration is typical of these altarpieces.",
