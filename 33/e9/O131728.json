The seat has a moulded edge, and rests on four turned legs, which are united beneath the seat by four rails with scratch mouldings and carved underside, and joined near the ground by four plain stretchers.\n\nNote that there is considerable warp on the legs. The seat has been refixed with new pegs, one of the original pegs split the rail and the hole has been filled, and a new hole drilled and pegged. Frame pegging original. Wear and movement convincing. Two crude nails on underside of one long rail.\n\nMarked in red, under the seat N5946\n\nWest Country.  Middle of the 17th century.\nFrom:  H.
