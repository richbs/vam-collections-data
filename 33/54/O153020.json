            "physical_description": "Plain weave cotton embroidered with silk in surface darning on the diagonal  and running stitch, backed with plain weave silk and faced with bias-cut plain weave silk and plain weave cotton and silk. The surface darning is worked to create a herringbone twill effect. The border has been cut and re-stitched and may have come from another embroidery; there are also three small patches [on the opposite corner to the Museum Number] from other embroideries.  The cover has a longitudinal axis pattern of an elaborate cross form in blue, leading into a fleur de lys form in faded red, either side of a central darker blue cartouche. This pattern is repeated laterally by the upper and lower border.  The rest of the field is infilled with two [three-quarters complete] notched and broken octagonal forms outlined in light blue enclosing S-shaped leaves and a larger version of the elaborate cross form.  All motifs are infilled with stylised floral elements.  The border is blue with an incomplete pattern composition based on a thin black stem carrying buds, flower heads and leaves in the same colouring.  The patches are in surface darning on the diagonal, but with no change of direction.\nEmbroidery threads: 2S silk; black, white, two shades of blue, yellow, very faded red [now beige], beige and light green.\nThe backing is purple silk and the facing is pink silk and beige cotton and silk.\nMaterials and Techniques: cotton yarn, silk thread, weaving, embroidering, sewing.",
