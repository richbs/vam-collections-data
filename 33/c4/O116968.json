The Virgin kneels before an open book with her attribute of a Lilly in the foreground while the Holy Spirit appears above her head in the form of a dove. The fragmentary border to the left has been moved to this location to mask the gap left by the missing figure of the Archangel Gabriel which originally faced the Virgin.\n\nThe original dimensions of this work may have exceeded 300 x 400cm. This fragment was apparently found in a Spanish convent, and the style of the Virgin's halo suggests that it was made in Valencia. Stylistically, it is based upon Netherlandish paintings of the mid-fifteenth century, which were exported in considerable numbers to Spain and Portugal. Flemish paintings were also copied by German engravers, whose prints disseminated their imagery throughout Western Europe. As a result, most Spanish painters of the later fifteenth century worked in styles which were essentially of Flemish derivation. This is a significant example of the once common but now rare Late Medieval genre of painting in grisaille on cloth.",

London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, pp. 283-284, cat. no. 348.\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\nVALENCIAN School c. 1500 \n\n348\nTHE VIRGIN ANNUNCIATE \nInk on linen \n7 ft X 6 ft  \u00bd in. (213 X 183 ) \nP.19-1928 \n\nAcquired as 'probably Flemish perhaps Antwerp school', the attribution to Spain was suggested independently by August L. Mayer and Chandler Post. The latter suggested a Valencian origin on the following grounds (letter to the Museum 19.3.1936): 'The halo for the Virgin Annunciate on linen would pretty surely place it in the school of Valencia. Such haloes are rather consistently used by the Martinez Master and his extensive following cf., for instance, figs. 151, 163, 164 and 171 of my volume VI. They are found, however, in other Valencian paintings, and the style would tend to assign the linen to the circle of the Osonas. The type and draperies, for example, are very similar in the Madonna that I illustrate as fig. 101 in my volume VI ... .' \nThe left border is not an integral part of the hanging but was sewn on and made up at the bottom, which raises the possibility that the angel originally appeared on the left. The left border could originally have been at the top or bottom. The purpose of the hanging is unknown; painted cloths were widely used in the 16th century as cheaper substitutes for tapestries. \n\nCondition. Left-hand border sewn on and made up at bottom with patches - part of the design is at the back at the bottom of this border. Considerably darned; the lily much damaged and repaired. \nProv.

            "history_note": "Bought from C. Gurtubay, London, in 1928.\n\nAccording to a V&A memorandum, dated 28 June 1928 (R/F MA11/G2135) the vendor stated that P.19-1928 \u2018has been sent over to him from Spain and it is stated to have been found in a Spanish convent\u2019.\n\nHistorical significance: P.19-1928 appears to have been assembled from elements of an originally larger whole. The image of the <i>Virgin Annunciate</i> has been visibly cropped at its bottom and left edges, and would originally have been accompanied by a representation of the Angel Gabriel, probably to the left of the Virgin, on a lost continuation of the support, or possibly on a separate piece of cloth. The vertical decorative borders of woven branches at right and left are apparently surviving elements of a border which ran around the periphery of the whole. The fragmentary border attached to the left edge has lost over a third of its width, and would originally have been about 60cm wide. It repeats the design of the narrower border at the right. The seam which runs through the trailing edge of the Virgin\u2019s mantle may not be original, and the strip of cloth which currently comprises the right edge of P.19-1928 may have been transferred to this location, and the edge of the mantle added to conceal the join. The narrow border may originally have run along the top edge, and the broad one along the bottom or one of the sides. If the original composition was on a continuous support, its overall dimensions would probably have exceeded 300 x 400cm; larger than most painted altarpieces, and of comparable size to a substantial tapestry. \n\nAlthough P.19-1928 is essentially a grisaille painting, the nimbus around the Holy Ghost and the stem of the lily were originally coloured \u2013 presumably to emphasise these significant accessories. The inscription around the edge of the vase has not been deciphered. \n\nThe iconography and formal repertory of P.19-1928 derive ultimately from Flemish religious paintings of the early to mid-fifteenth century. These were exported to various regions of Western Europe, and especially to Spain and Portugal, where they had a major impact on local productions. By the middle of the century, such works were being copied by German engravers, which disseminated their imagery more pervasively and further afield. The facial type and attitude of the Virgin, the flat, geometrical folds of her mantle and the cruciform nimbus of the Holy Ghost, in the form of a dove, are reminiscent of the engravings of the anonymous Master E.S., active in the Rhine region from the mid-1450s until 1467. He was one of the most productive and influential print-makers of the fifteenth century, and his works were exported to many regions of Europe, including Italy. The tracery borders of woven branches are also German in character; reminiscent, for example, of that which appears at the top of the woodcut of <i>God the Father</i> on fol. 1v of the Nuremberg <i>World Chronicle</i>, published in 1493 in large Latin and German editions, and also exported widely. \n\nAccording to a V&A memorandum, dated 28 June 1926 (R/F MA11/G2135) M.J. Friedl\u00e4nder had seen nothing similar to P.19-1928, and its proposed dating of around 1500 was a consensus of the opinions of Martin Hardie, E.W. Tristram and Bernard Rackham. Although initially catalogued as \u2018probably Flemish perhaps Antwerp school\u2019, its identification as Spanish has not been doubted since it was first proposed in 1936. \n\nOn the basis of the Virgin\u2019s double halo (inner circle with flames and outer circle with pearl-like decoration) \u2013 which resembles several in Valencian paintings of the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries \u2013 it has been suggested that the work was produced in Valencia. This is not implausible, as Valencia was one of the largest and most cosmopolitan cities in Aragon, and a major centre of cultural exchange between the Iberian Peninsula and Northern Europe. A principal early enthusiast for Netherlandish painting was Alfonso V the Magnanimous (1416-1458), King of Aragon and Naples, whose collection included religious paintings on linen by Rogier van der Weyden. (Wolfthal, op. cit., p.15). He also owned panel paintings by Van Eyck, to whom he sent the Valencian painter Lluis Dalmau to study in 1431. Painted after his return from Flanders, Dalmau\u2019s <i>Madonna of the Counsellors</i>, in Barcelona, indicates his familiarity with Van Eyck\u2019s <i>Ghent Altarpiece</i>. Dalmau also painted a cloth altar frontal with a scene of <i>The Annunciation</i> -now lost- for the castle of X\u00e1tiva in the province of Valencia. Such paintings, as well as German prints, may have provided a precedent for P.19-1928. \n\nThis work is of considerable significance, as an indicator of how prototypes of Netherlandish origin were disseminated throughout Western Europe, and a major example of the once-numerous but now exceedingly rare genre of grisaille on cloth.", 
            "place": "Spain", 
            "production_note": "Attribution note: The technique of painting in pigments bound with animal glue and water on a cloth support is generally known as distemper painting (T\u00fcchlein in German or Aguazo in Spanish). \nIt is mentioned in treatises on painting from the Middle Ages until Francisco Pacheco\u2019s <i>Arte de la Pintura</i> of 1638.  Its principal advantage in comparison with oil or tempera on panel was its relative speed and cheapness. It was also especially suitable for works of large format, for occasional use, or export \u2013 as such pictures were light and could be rolled up. Its disadvantage is its fragility; the vast majority of works in this technique have been lost, and the few that survive are generally in poor condition. \n(Diane Wolfthal, <i>The Beginnings of Netherlandish Canvas Painting 1400-1530</i>, Cambridge 1989, pp.1-37.)", 
            "historical_context_note": "During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, many pictures were painted in water-based colours or distemper on linen or canvas. For example, in fifteenth century Bruges as many as 40% of painters seem to have specialised in such work. (Wolfthal, op. cit., pp.6-7). In Flanders during the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, the exterior shutters of painted triptychs were usually decorated with monochrome paintings in grisaille (black and grey), and often with representations of <i>The Annunciation</i>. To reduce the weight attendant on their large size, movable organ shutters were sometimes made of stretched canvas rather than planks, and decorated with religious images. Monochrome paintings on cloth could serve as cartoons for tapestries, or as wall hangings in heir own right. \u2018Lenten cloths\u2019, painted with religious subjects in sober colours, were sometimes hung before altars during Lent, the forty days\u2019 period of fast preceding Easter, when it was a liturgical requirement that altars should be covered. A <i>Virgin and Child</i> of around 1400, in grisaille on cloth, survives in the Cathedral of Huesca, and another, from Palencia and of late fifteenth century date depicting <i>The Annunciation</i> and <i>The Visitation</i>, is in the Prado. The <i>Annunciation</i> was an especially appropriate subject for Lenten use, as its feast day occurs on March 25th. On account of the fragility and low intrinsic value of these images, only a tiny fraction of this production has survived. Because of their low rate of survival, and consequent lack of comparative works, it can be difficult to divine the original purpose of such pictures. The subject-matter and large scale of this image suggest that it was made for display in a religious setting of some size, which is consistent with its apparent discovery in a Spanish convent.\n\nM.
