A grassy foreground is roughly indicated with green brush strokes rising to the plain ivory-coloured ground of the painting which gives way towards the top to a band of clouds in  pink, orange and mauve.  Above this there are two simurghs flying towards each other in a blue sky.  The birds have brown bodies, green wattles and yellow tail plumes streaming out behind them.\n      The painting has a plain inner border of strips of pale ochre-coloured paper outlined in gold  lines with black rulings set on a plain ivory-coloured page with strips of dark grey paper outlined in gold at its edges.  There is a strip of beige-coloured woven textile attached to the inner side of the page as a gutter for the binding.",

It contains 56 leaves on which are Mughal miniature paintings, drawing and flower studies on both sides. The binding is covered with an Indian brocade silk that may have been cut from lengths brought home by the 2nd Lord Clive, who served as Governor of Madras, 1799 to 1803.  The album was sold from Powis Castle at Sotheby's sale, 16 to 18 January 1956, lot 332A.",
