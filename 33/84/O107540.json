Also captured in the foreground on the right hand side of picture  is the side of the mountain and an overhanging branch, this was typical of  picturesque scenes of that period.  In the midground, the path leads off into the distance but the viewers eye is drawn to a figure in the centre. This is a European figure, possibly Dr G.R.

From July to December 1866 he toured a part of the Himalayan region. He wrote about his journey in The British Journal of Photography, outlining his route, and in some cases describing the scenes he photographed.\n\n This is how he describes the history of this view: 'Next day our march followed the course of a stream that descended from the Jalori Pass (11,000 feet elevation), the path running some distance above it along the slopes of the mountains which formed one side of a narrow valley. About a mile below our encampment we had a fine view. Looking back towards the pass, the hillsides were wooded to their summits, and the little stream, swollen by yesterday's heavy rain tumbled over its boulders in a foamy mass, forming a sinuous line of silver through the dense foliage. The day was cloudy and dull; but I halted to get a picture of this fine sylvan scene, and of another almost as fine looking the other way. I had some difficulty in doing this, as my cloths and polishing leathers were all still very damp from yesterday's soaking. However I overcame this difficulty, and secured two as good negatives (12 x 10) as was possible on a cloudy day.'",

            "historical_context_note": "Samuel Bourne wrote and published an account of his journey in which he mentions the places that he photographed. Below is the relevant section for this photograph: \n\n'Next day our march followed the course of a stream that descended from the Jalori Pass, the path running some distance above it along the slopes of the mountains which formed one side of a narrow valley. About a mile below our encampment we had a fine view. Looking back towards the pass, the hillsides were wooded to their summits, and the little stream, swollen by yesterday's heavy rain tumbled over its boulders in a foamy mass, forming a sinuous line of silver through the dense foliage. The day was cloudy and dull; but I halted to get a picture of this fine sylvan scene, and of another almost as fine looking the other way. I had some difficulty in doing this, as my cloths and polishing leathers were all still very damp from yesterday's soaking. However I overcame this difficulty, and secured two as good negatives (12 x 10) as was possible on a cloudy day.'\n\nThis catalogue record is for the second photograph described in the passage written by Bourne, the first one being museum number 53,063.\n\nBourne, S, A Photographic journey through the Higher Himalayas, The British Journal of Photography, December 3 1869, pg 579.",
