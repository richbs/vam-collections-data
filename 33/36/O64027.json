            "bibliography": "'I.D.E.N.T.I.T.A: Identity. Three New Designers', Marco Romanelli, Abitare, March 1996\nObjects of use are also and always tools of communication. They convey our tastes and idiosyncrasies.  For Genethlios Michael Anastassiades they also have to convey our voices.  Basic objects like glasses thus become amazingly changeable, like sound itself and the content of the words we entrust to them.  The work of youthful, thought-provoking Anastassiades is based on communication.  He starts with the ancient Greek saying - \"Let me once drink from your glass and I shall know all your secrets\".\n'Object Lessons', Stephen Todd, Dutch, No.17, 1998\n'Michael Anastassiades marries art, design and ideas to make things that are witty and fun', Michelle Ogundehin, Elle Decoration, July/August 1998\nSpeak into the wooden 'message cups' and your words come back to you: like holding a shell to your ear to hear the sea.\nIntersection, Katerina Gregos, The Hellenic Centre, London, June 1997\nHis Message Cups are not inanimate functional containers but interactive mechanisms which transcend their everyday purpose, act as vessels of communication which unleash possibilities of exchange, and begin to reflect social conditions such as the breakdown of communication in the domestic environment.\nLost and Found: Critical Voices in New British Design, Birkhauser / The British Council, 1999\nDrawing on his engineering skills, Anastassiades designed a plywood cup with a false bottom containing an electronic recording devce which stored a spoken message when the cup was turned upside down, and replayed it to the cup's next user. \"The external examiner was James Dyson\", he says, \"and he tore me apart when I presented it to him.  He couldn't see why anyone would want to leave a message in a cup.  He said 'It's not functional'.\"  Cypriot culture, on the other hand, would make sense of the idea.  There, a saying has it that if you want to hear the gossip, you must listen to your tea cup.\nMonument, Architecture Design, July-August 1997. Stephen Todd article.\nProducts of our Time, David Redhead, August/Birkhauser, 2000\nMichael Anastassiades profile, Caroline Roux, Blueprint, October 1998\nStill Objects Run Deep, William L. Hamilton, The New York Times, 28 December 2000; The International Herald Tribune, Paris, 9 January 2001; Kathimerini, Athens, 14 January 2001\nHis Message Cup is a vessel for holding words, not water. A thin electronic card embedded in the bottom will record a brief message, storing it when the cup is inverted.  When the cup is turned up, ready to pour, the message plays back.  It could be instructions for a child home from school; it could be a lover's greeting.  The cup, a familiar item, is being used to question the nature of content.  How special it becomes depends on who fills it, why and with what.\nSpace Cadets, James Perlove, Time Out, June 9-16 1999",
