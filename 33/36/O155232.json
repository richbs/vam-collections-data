The central panel is decorated with a pointed niche form the spandrels of which are patterned with squares each composed of 4 triangular forms, and divided by 2 diagonal lines of pulled thread work forming a net.  Narrow diagonal 'net' forms the actual arch profile edging a row of reciprocal trefoils.  In the arch apex a lozenge form, flanked by 2 triangles, and edged along the bottom by a zigzag stripe.  From this is 'suspended' a geometrical shape edged with pulled thread work [might it be a mosque lamp?] and below 2 lateral rows of small satin stitch lozenges [?representing a rosary?].  Then follow three decorative shapes, 2 with pulled thread work patterns, one below the other.  Around the 3 sides of this lower section are 2 rows of squares composed of triangles, followed by a narrow zigzag band in between 2 narrow rows of pulled thread work.  The theme of squares and triangles with occasional diagonal lines of pulled thread work net frame this central panel, culminating in a zigzag band of satin stitch.\nCotton thread: Z-spun\nEmbroidery thread: white silk, 2S\nThere is one selvedge.",
