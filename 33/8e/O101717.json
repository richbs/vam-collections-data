Unlike the embroidered caps, this one is made of a rectangle of linen gathered into a circle of fabric at the crown.

In the 19th c. a female successor married into the Troyte Bullock family. \n\nAccording to family tradition the cap was thought to have belonged to Charles I, but there is no crown with the embroidered 'C' or 'R' &  'I'.  Such an attribution with more concrete documentation is dubious and the cap has been acquired solely for its intrinsic value as fine and rare example of 17th century dress.\n\nHistorical significance: This is a very rare example of an undecorated cap, of a type probably once very common.  The earflaps and ties suggest that it was worn to bed.",
