He became royal architect, Comptroller of His Majesty's Works, and later was made Surveyor-General. He was largely responsible for introducing the Chinoiserie style of decoration into England.\n\nMaterials & Design\nThe handle and escutcheon are made of cast brass, which has been chased and gilt. A coat of lacquer was then applied to improve its golden colour. Door furniture was considered to be an important element in the decoration of a room in the 18th century. Robert and James Adam illustrate what are described as 'Designs of Furniture for the locks of doors' in their Works in Architecture, and the owner of the Soho Manufactory in Birmingham, Matthew Boulton, is known to have supplied gilt-brass door furniture based on Adam designs. This handle and escutcheon were removed from Somerset House when the house was being altered in the mid-19th century.",
