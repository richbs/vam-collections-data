The artist established the Fine Arts Department at the University of Balochistan and headed the department for three years. In 1985 he formed the Artists Association of Balochistan and became the first Chairman of Artists Association of Pakistan. Jamal obtained a Master's in English Literature from Balochistan University in 1978. He later obtained a Masters in Fine Arts from the Slade School of Art, London.\n\nIn this street scene, Jamal has depicted two dogs barking at a motorcycle rikshaw which is preceded by a cyclist and a woman. A soldier stands near the dogs. The figures are partly concealed by bars. Through a barred window, as if to enhance the general sense of claustrophobia, the artist has depicted mountains.",
