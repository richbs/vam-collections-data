She established a salon which was frequented by writers and the military. She was considered to be one of the great international beauties, with extremely pale, almost transparent skin and golden hair. She was frequently the subject of articles in the New York Times during the early 20th century. Her clothes were purchased from couturiers in London, Paris, and New York, and demonstrated an elegantly avant-garde approach to style.\n\nAt the time of acquisition Emilie Grigsby's friend, Miss Chisholm, stated that this dress was a Vionnet, but this requires further research. The collection includes at least two other possible Vionnets. (T.171-1967 and T.170-1967)",
