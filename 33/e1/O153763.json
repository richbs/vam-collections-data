B. Waring.  The eagle ensign was also used on a hair pin in the Castellani display as one of the items in an 'ivory casket with all the jewels for the toilette of a Roman lady in ancient times'.  Alessandro Castellani wrote to Henry Layard, the distinguished archaeologist and patron of contemporary decorative arts, in 1861 that he believed the casket 'will be much talked about'.",
