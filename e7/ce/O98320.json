            "public_access_description": "This booth was made by Punch and Judy performer Gus Wood, in about 1912. He travelled with this booth in its accompanying canvas bag for 50 years, giving shows alongside his assistant Bimbo.\n\nThe booth, made of wood, metal and striped canvas, also includes Wood\u2019s cast of puppets, and a range of accessories that suggest a noisy, lively puppet show.\n\nBimbo, the \u2018bottler\u2019, would wear the black silk opera hat and attract a crowd using the drum and pan pipes. Once the show started, Gus Wood could look out through a slit in the canvas to watch the reactions of the crowd.\n\nPunch and Judy is an improvised theatrical form, based around a conventional storyline. So each Punch performer would have used the same characters \u2013 Punch, Judy, the Baby, the Policeman, Doctor, Hangman, Crocodile etc \u2013 but performed the narrative differently.\n\nGus Wood had two special sound effects as part of his show. The interminable cries of the baby that annoy Punch so much were created by a deflating rubber balloon, and the frightening advance of the crocodile would be accompanied by the turning of a metal grater.\n\nGus Wood used this booth for fifty years, until he retired in 1962. The same year, he celebrated Punch\u2019s 300th anniversary in Covent Garden, and collected signatures from all the performers in attendance on his drum.",
