            "public_access_description": "This caricature of Albert Chevalier is from the fourth album that the commercial artist George Cooke used for his caricatures of music hall and variety performers. It contains caricatures drawn from 1910 to 1919. Originally from Yorkshire, George Cooke specialised in designing illustrated publicity material for performers. These included flyers, letterheads, posters and newspaper advertisements. He was based at the Grand Theatre for several years. The theatre was designed by Frank Matcham and opened in 1894. Cooke later moved to Blackpool, where he drew performers at the Palace Theatre.\n\nBy 1917 Cooke appears to have moved to London, where he established Cooke\u2019s Publicity Agency at 453 The Strand. We know that he had considered a move to London for some time, since in May 1906, when he was still in Hanley, a note from him was printed in the variety artistes\u2019 magazine The Performer. It read:\n\nPhil Ray says my work\u2019s too good for Hanley; I ought to be in London. But I want money to start with. Who\u2019ll give me some! Griff can\u2019t afford now he\u2019s two families to keep. But he wishes me luck. Many thanks, old friend. GEORGE COOKE, Caricaturist, Hanley.\n\nPhil Ray and Griff were both performers whose caricatures feature in Cooke\u2019s albums.",
