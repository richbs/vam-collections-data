Bertha wrote the stories in verse and Florence drew the pictures, using as inspiration her childhood toys - a black leather faced doll she had allegedly acquired at a fair when she lived in the United States, and some wooden dolls. Although it is likely that Florence's toy was based on the Minstrel tradition in the United States, her fictional Golliwogg was a friendly, brave and adventurous character.\n\nThe books were such a success that it was not long before several types of spin-off merchandise began to appear, including card games and nursery china, and of course soft toys. It was relatively easy to make one's own golly and this example is an early attempt that was then played with by three generations of the same family.",
