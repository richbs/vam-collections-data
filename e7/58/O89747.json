The photographer, Calvert Jones, was introduced to the process by a cousin of Talbot and by close friends who lived near to Jones in South Wales. \n\nJones's work stands out in the early development of photography because of his ability to fuse his new skill in photography with his experience as a marine watercolorist. This\ncomposition, with its strong foreground elements and high straight slipway leading in to the subject, emphasises both the tall ship and its sculptural shape.",

Trained as a watercolourist, he was one of the first to apply a schooled artist's eye to photography.\n\nThis composition emphasises the importance of the ship. The high walls of slipway and the foreshortened lengths of unhewn wood lead the eye to tall masted ship. Leaninmg planks of wood and the stern of the small estuary boat establsih the context of the working ship yard.",
