A string moulding separates the everted rim, matching the base in height. \n\nA single ring-handle, the front of the loop moulded and engraved as a feline mask, is positioned on the intersection of the rim and body\nOn the opposite side, three ribbed lotus buds are moulded in relief and arranged in a triangle.  On the remaining six panels single moulded lotus buds are centrally placed.\n\nOn the flat lip eight horizontal cartouches with incurving sides, framed by twin fillets, enclose foliate and floral scrolls.  In the intervals roundels enclose divergent stalks.\nOn the rim, similar cartouches frame epigraphic sections, separated by roundels each enclosing a motif of three divergent stalks with tri-lobed leaves.  \n\nOn the walls, rectangular panels framed by double fillets enclose cusped arches which in turn frame the relief-moulded lotus buds, each highlighted by a lotus-bud-shaped double fillet.\nOn the base, an arrangement of epigraphic sections separated by roundels match that on the everted rim.\n\nPatina: patches of red oxide leaving the native olive yellow hue to appear.
