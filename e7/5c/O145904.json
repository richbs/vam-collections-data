In 1888 he became a publisher in his own right with offices at 24 St. Bride Street, London. He appointed the writer and editor, Robert Ellice Mack, as director. \n\nNister specialised in high quality colour printing for children in the last quarter of the 19th century. Movable books with various mechanisms became his speciality after 1890 (when be published his first stand-up book) but he also produced numerous picture books, annuals, poetry, nursery rhymes, calendars and greetings cards. He worked with a core of writers, including Clifton Bingham and Robert Ellice Mack, and illustrators, in particular Eveline Lance, Harriett M. Bennett, Edith A. Cubitt and Rosa Petherick.\n\nAudley Gunston produced frontispiece illustrations to a number of Charles Dickens' novels, including 'Tom Tiddler's Ground', published by Chapman and Hall in 1861. 'Tom Tidler's Ground', also called 'Tom Tiddler's Ground' or 'Tommy Tiddler's Ground', is the name of an ancient children's game; the phrase has come to mean the ground or tenement of a sluggard, or of one who is easily taken advantage of.",
