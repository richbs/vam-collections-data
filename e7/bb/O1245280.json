The shield has a printed sticker on its face showing a stylised black eagle with orange beak on a yellow ground. A red paper pennant is attached to the halberd by a metal staple. This has various text printed on it in black and white relating to other Mettoy Playcraft products. The box, which is oblong in shape, consists of a clear plastic base and top, attached to sides of a more flexible clear plastic.",

It is made from coloured plastic, slotted together and pivoting at the shoulders and waist, and is an example from the 'Busybodies' range of toys, which Mettoy manufactured throughout the 1970s to compete with the German Playmobil range of toys, which was similar though smaller. By 1978 the range was made up of a number of different series, including space, army, an emergency team, wild west, knights, road builders, winter sports and divers, with also a show jumping and school classroom gift set. A range of vehicles and other equipment and accessories was also available for each series.\n\nThe packaging for this particular example differs from the usual backing card and bubble packaging that this range of figures were usually sold in. In adition, the presence of the pennant advertising other Mettoy Playcraft ranges suggests that this object was produced as a promotional item.
