The uprights are connected with pairs of thinner, diagonal struts, composed of brass fillets, cast at their crossings and where each is attached to the columns, with circular bosses. The top of the uprights are formed of sphinx heads in brass, set proud of a circular frieze, which is decorated centrally between the uprights with mounts of anthemia flanking roundels. Inside the frieze, at the top, is set a circle of thin timber (stained pine), which fills the whole central area. It is supported by three angle brackets which are rivetted to the inside of the frieze, behind the sphinx heads.  Each is attached with a screw to the underside of the wooden panel.  This provides a support for the circular marble top of Carrara marble with moulded perimeter, which extends over the heads of the sphinxes.",

            "public_access_description": "This stand and its pair (W.54-2005), are versions of designs first published at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Thomas Hope showed four variations of this tripod design in his book Household Furniture and Interior Decoration, published in London in 1807, although those are shorter, for use on side tables. Another similar design had already been published in France in 1801 by Charles Percier and Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Louis Fontaine in their Receuil de D\u00e9corations Int\u00e9rieures.\n\nThis version was clearly designed as a stand for a lamp or a small side table. The stands were owned by the Earl and Countess of Abingdon who married in 1928. Lady Abingdon inherited a collection of French Empire furniture formed by her ancestor Lord Stuart de Rothesay between about 1820 and 1840. In Britain in the 1930s, there was a great interest in English Regency furnishings and the Abingdons may have bought as fashionable items, tying in with the French furniture they had inherited.",
