            "history_note": "The chair is the most important example of Race's bent steel furniture designs. It was created for the Time Life Building, New Bond Street, London. The 'Kangoroo' was designed for the terrace, but was used also within the interior. It had a chair and a rocking chair version. The seat and the back are formed from one continuous length of steel rod, which was cold bent on a jig. For this process they had to keep the factory doors open to accommodate the rod's unbroke length. The structure of the wire grid of a grill tray of a gas cooker gave the inspiration for the design (according to Alexander Gardner-Medwin).\nThe chair was a gift from Race to one of his friends, Marianne Straub. She made a gift of this chair to the painter Walter Hoyle. Hoyle owned it until 1996 when he sold it to the fashion retailer and entrepreneur Tommy Roberts.\n\nHistorical significance: Only two extant examples are known of this model. One has been kept in the garden, it's condition is poor. The V&A's example is in a very good condition.",

Henry Moore produced the sculptural works of the screen at the top of the building. He was also commissioned to make a reclining figure for the terrace.",
