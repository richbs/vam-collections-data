The dolls have small vinyl hands and heads and their bodies are filled with 'beans', making them soft and able to pose in a variety of positions. They were advertised as \"Lots of floppy, ploppy, posing fun, snuggly and soft\". Later, the dolls hands were made from cloth so they appeared more like mittens, as can be seen on this doll. The earliest dolls were simple babies and came in a variety of colours, where later, themes began to emerge including dolls with babies and nursery rhymes.",
