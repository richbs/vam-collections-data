She represents the absorption of early Indian nature-spirit deities into the Hindu religious system.\n \nAs a water deity Yamuna is represented standing on a creature of the waters, a tortoise (\u2018kurma\u2019). An attendant at her feet carries her principal attribute, the water jar (\u2018kamandalu\u2019), symbolic of her role as bringer of fertility. She is accompanied by two female attendants, one of whom reaches up to support the staff of a parasol (now lost). \n\nSculptural representations of river goddesses appear from the 2nd century BCE. By the 6th century Yamuna, together with Ganga and Sarawati, who make up the three principal river goddesses, appear in a rock-cut shrine at Ellora. Ganga and Yamuna became an established part of Hindu temple design schemes, appearing as door-jamb decorations flanking temple entrances. They embody the powers to cleanse and purify, to \u2018wash away sins\u2019, and their presence at the threshold of a temple symbolises these roles. They also mark the transition from the mundane to the celestial world evoked by the temple.",

As an acquatic deity Yamuna is represented standing on a creature of the waters, a tortoise (<i>kurma</i>) and an attendant at her feet carries her principal attribute, the water jar (<i>kamandalu</i>), symbolic of her role as bringer of fertility.Yamuna is seen with two female attendants, one of whom reaches up to support the staff of a parasol  (now lost).  To the left stands a bearded figure, probably that of Surya, the father of Yamuna, dressed in <i>udicyavesha</i>, his characteristic \"Northerner's dress\" of cap, trousers and high boots. Garland-bearing ducks hover above.Yamuna is the personification of one of the great rivers of northern India, the Yamuna, representing the absorption of early Indian nature-spirit deities into the Hindu religious system.  Sculptural representations of river goddesses appear from the 2nd century  B.C. and by the Gupta end, 3rd-4th century A.D., are an established part of Hindu temple design schemes. Yamuna usually appears with her counterpart, the river goddess Ganga, as door jamb decorations flanking temple entrances.",
