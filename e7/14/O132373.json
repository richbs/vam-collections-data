In his scenes of peasant life, mainly exteriors, he is closely dependent on Adriaen van Ostade, but he also painted landscapes. \n\nManner of Isack van OSTADE\n\n263\nLANDSCAPE WITH HORSEMAN AND A \nCART \nInscribed with a false signature lower left \nCanvas \n14 \u00bc X 12 \u00bc (36 X 31) \n345-1878\n\nThis was originally catalogued as by Isack van Ostade (1893 Catalogue, p. 183) but it was not listed as such by Hofstede de Groot (iii, 1910) and the ascription has no longer been accepted for some time. Despite its poor quality it may be a 17th century work, though the possibility that it is a later copy cannot be excluded. \n\nCondition. Paint surface worn; restored in 1959. \nProv.
