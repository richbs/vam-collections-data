Registered File number 1985/2322.\n\nLetter from owner (30/1/1986): Dress belonged to his grandmother, Louise Melanie, married to Sir Colville Barclay, 11th Baronet of Pierston, on 8th May 1855. She was the daughter of Edouard de Belzim of Mauritius, where they married.  Sir Colville was born in Mauritius on 20th December 1829. He entered the Colonial Service in 1845 and filled the office of Receiver General in Mauritius and Auditor General in Ceylon, with a seat in the Legislative and Executive Councils in both colonies. He was made CMG on his retirement. He died in Paris on 18th February 1896.\n\nThe owner does not know if the dress was imported from France or made in Mauritius.\n\nThere is a photograph in the Register of Lady Barclay wearing a similar dress, dated 24th June 1860, Paris. Possibly updating dress T.512 to 1860.",
