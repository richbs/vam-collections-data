Caricature of John Philip Kemble as Macbeth with a parody of his soliloquy printed underneath, published by S.W. Fores, 1809. \n\nIn 1808 the theatre at Covent Garden was destroyed by fire. A new theatre was built on the site, opening on 18 September 1809 with a performance of Macbeth, featuring the theatre's manager, John Philip Kemble.  The cost of rebuilding Covent Garden was so great that Kemble raised the price of the seats and this provoked an uproar on the first night, with the performance drowned out by shouting and hissing. The evening ended in chaos when the audience refused to leave the building and the police were called. This was the start of three months of protests, known as the Old Price Riots. Kemble tried to carry on with performances but his audiences, armed with rattles, were equally determined to keep up the disruption until there was a return to the old prices of the previous theatre. Eventually, Kemble was forced to admit defeat and lower the seat prices.\n\nThis satirical print shows Kemble's Macbeth recoiling before a rattle.",
