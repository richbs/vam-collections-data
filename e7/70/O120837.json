Large, gilded shrines, usually shaped like a long house with pitched roof, were produced all over Europe to house the bones of important saints.  They could combine gilded metal with enamelled decoration, as well as jewels, crystal, and even antique cameos, and usually had ornamental finials on the tip of the gable at each end, and sometimes at intervals along the roof ridge.\nThe finials of the Cologne shrines produced towards the end of the 12th century tend either to be simple spheres made of crystal or of metal covered in enamel decoration, or made of gilt metal, decorated in various ways but with no enamel.  They do often make use of decoration in the form of leaves and fruits as does the V&A example, but are otherwise not very similar in form or style.\nThe use of enamel plaques to decorate finials seems to be a slightly later development.  Enamels are found on the St-Taurin chasse, from the church of St-Taurin in Evreux, France.  Like the plaques on the V&A finial, these are teardrop-shaped, although the rest of the finial is not similar.   A finial in Boston, catalogued as Meuse Valley or western Germany, mid 13th century, has similar teardrop-shaped plaques, decorated with niello, although its foliage decoration and fruits are slightly different and it is missing its top element.",

            "historical_context_note": "This finial would have adorned a larger metalwork structure, probably a shrine.  Large, gilded shrines, usually shaped like a long house with pitched roof, were produced all over Europe to house the bones of important saints.  They could combine gilded metal with enamelled decoration, as well as jewels, crystal, and even antique cameos, and usually had ornamental finials on the tip of the gable at each end, and sometimes at intervals along the roof ridge.\nThe finials of the Cologne shrines produced towards the end of the 12th century (see <font -u>Ornamenta Eccesiae</font -u>, Cologne, 1985, cat. E18, E79, E80, E91, E114, F90) tend either to be simple spheres made of crystal or of metal covered in enamel decoration, or made of gilt metal, decorated in various ways but with no enamel.  They do often make use of decoration in the form of leaves and fruits as does the V&A example, but are otherwise not very similar in form or style.\nThe use of enamel plaques to decorate finials seems to be a slightly later development.  Examples are found on the St-Taurin chasse, from the church of St-Taurin in Evreux, France (<font -u>Les Tr\u00e9sors des Eglises de France</font -u>, Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs, Paris, 1965, cat. no.217, illus. in b&w).  Like the plaques on the V&A finial, these are teardrop-shaped, although the rest of the finial is not similar.  These plaques are believed to have heraldic significance - they show alternately the fleur-de-lys signifying France and the castles of Castile. But it is unlikely that the enamels on the V&A finial have any heraldic meaning .\nA finial in Boston (N. Netzer, <font -u>Medieval Objects in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston</font -u>, Boston, 1991, cat. no. 23, inv. no. 49.465), catalogued as Meuse Valley or western Germany, mid 13th century, has similar teardrop-shaped plaques, decorated with niello, although its foliage decoration and fruits are slightly different and it is missing its top element.",
