            "public_access_description": "Floriano Ferramola (c. 1480-1528) was born in Brescia where he spent all his life. He may have been an apprentice to Vincenzo Foppa (c.1427-c.1515) and was mainly active as a fresco painter. He may have trained or at least collaborated with Alessandro Bonvicino called Moretto da Brescia (1492/5-1554) and also perhaps Gerolamo Romanino (1484/7-1560?).\n\nThis is the largest of a series of at least 17 frescos painted by Floriano Ferramola in Palazzo Calini at Brescia. The painting shows a tournament in the Piazza Grande in Brescia, an entertainment that became customary in Brescia from the 1480s onwards.  All around, peering from balconies, loggias and balustrades, is a crowd of spectators waving banners. In the background are the loggetta and the clock tower with the wall of the Cittadella Vecchia and the Tower of the Broletto on the right. In the foreground are men and women dressed in typical late 15th-century costumes. Here the insistence of the architectural elements derives from the Lombard taste for magnificent architectures shown in deep perspective.",

Before 1800,</u> London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, pp. 102-103, no. 116.\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\nFloriano FERRAMOLA (c. 1480-1528)\nItalian (Brescian) School\nBorn in Brescia, he is said to have been a pupil of Vincenzo Foppa. Among his few dated works are the <i>Madonna and Saints</i> in Berlin (1513) and the frescoes in the church of S. Maria di Lovere, Brescia (1514). Gerolamo Romanino was his most eminent pupil.\n\n116 \nA TOURNAMENT AT BRESCIA \nFresco transferred to canvas \n14 ft 8 in. x 8 ft 7 in. (4.5 X 2.7 m.) \n887[8]-1861 \n\nThe scene is set in the Piazza Maggiore at Brescia; in the background are the Logetta with the clock tower, the wall of the Cittadella Vecchia and the Tower of the Broletto. Fenaroli (1877) identified the tournament with the one held in honour of Caterina Cornaro who passed several months at Brescia in 1495 with her brother, then Podest\u00e0 of the city. \nThis is the largest and most splendid of a series of frescoes painted by Ferramola in the Casa Borgondio della Corte at Brescia. The series was fully described by Odorici in 1853 and by Fenaroli in 1877, though it was no longer entirely <i>in situ</i> at the latter date. The compositions described by Odorici and Fenaroli may be identified with the following paintings: \nI. Pinacoteca Tosio e Martinengo, Brescia (See <i>La pittura bresciana del Rinascimento</i>, exhibition, Brescia, 1939, pp. 74-8, nos. 31-4, repr.): \n1. Falconry scene, with mounted horse standing in a pond in centre \t\t\t\t\t\t\t1.56 x 1.43 m.\n2.

Sacrifice of Iphigenia\t\t\t\t\t\t3.07 x 2.41 m.\nIII. Victoria & Albert Museum, 8876-1861 \n8. Tournament at Brescia \t\t\t\t\t\t4.47 x 2.67 m. \nIV. Collection Ugo da Como, Lonato (Nicodemi, 1925, p. 17, repr.) \n9. Two captains in armour (half length fragments). \n\nOdorici and Fenaroli described the Parnassus scene as 'a dance of young women', and Diana and Actaeon as 'a horseman on a white horse followed by a huntsman', but these descriptions fit well with the compositions of the two paintings concerned. The other pictures listed may also be recognized in these 19th century descriptions. \nAccording to another 19th century source (Ransonnet, 1845) the frescoes were signed <i>OPUS FLORIANI FERRAMOLAE</i>. Nicodemi (1925) dated them c. 1511 on stylistic grounds. There is also a tradition that they were painted in 1512 which, though apocryphal, should be mentioned here. Ferramola was famous for his display of calm and courage during the sack of Brescia by French troops under Gaston de Foix in 1512. A party of French soldiers, on entering his house, found him engaged in painting. Without interrupting his work, he told the soldiers to take what they liked, as long as they left him his brushes, with which he could recoup all he had lost. However, in the event he was so reduced in circumstances by the French, that he was forced to seek the help of Gaston de Foix, who commissioned a portrait of himself for two hundred scudi. \nThis story first appears in Ottavio Rossi, <i>Elogi historici di bresciani illustri</i>, Brescia, 1620, p. 506 f. It was repeated by Carlo Ridolfi, <i>Le meraviglie dell'arte</i>, i, 1648, p. 245, and thereafter by most historians of the city or art of Brescia. Both Rossi and Ridolfi state clearly that Ferramola was in his house when the French soldiers arrived, but in a later version of the story, embodied by G. F. Gambara, <i>Gesti dei bresciani duranta le lega di Cambrai</i>, Brescia, 1820 (p. 249 f., n. 76) the scene is set in the Casa Borgondio at the time when the painter was working there. If this is accepted, the frescoes could be dated February 1512, the date of the French incursion, but as this is a late, amended version of a romantic legend, it can hardly be considered as convincing evidence. \nAs the Museum acquired the Tournament in 1861, the process of dismantling these frescoes must have begun by that date. In 1871, when Crowe and Cavalcaselle described the series, the paintings now in the Pinacoteca at Brescia were still in situ. They appear to have been taken down in about 1875 (<i>Pinacoteca Tosio e Martinengo</i>, 1927). \n\nProv.

            "history_note": "Purchased in 1861.\n\nHistorical significance: This fresco transferred on canvas was originally depicted by the Brescian painter Floriano Ferramola in the Palazzo Calini, in vicolo Borgondio, Brescia, and may have been commissioned by Mariotto Calini between 1508 and 1514. His initials \u2018Mar Cha\u2019 appear along the top of the wall and the Calini\u2019s arms, a ladder, in a frieze as well as on the shield held by the triton in the left semi-lunette of 8878-1861. This device of a ladder in Calini\u2019s coat of arms may be a punning reference to the word <i>Scalini</i>, \u2018steps\u2019 in Italian. The attribution, widely corroborated by local historical sources, was further confirmed by the recent finding, after restoration, of a scroll inscribed with the words [O]PUS/FLORIANI/FERAMOLA from small areas of fresco still visible <i>in situ</i>. \n\nThe V&A fresco forms the largest detached panel of a large decorative scheme which originally included friezes of playful putti, dolphins, festoons and grotesques, and at least 17 other scenes (E. Lucchesi Ragni, 1995). Four 4 are currently in the Pinacoteca Tosio Martinengo, Brescia: \n-Betrothal \n-Myrrha and Cinyras \n-Hunt with falcon \n-Birth of Adonis \n\nand 8 previously in the collection of Sir Humphrey Noble, bought on the London market in 1960 by a Roman collector:\n-Punishment of Midas (Private collection, Rome)\n- Sacrifice of Iphigenia (Private collection, Rome)\n- Diana and Actaeon (Private collection, Rome)\n- Nymphs in a Pond\n- Maid with a Dish\n- Pan \n- Apollo.\n\nFour other fragments are missing, but are known through documents (Stefano Bardini\u2019s photographic archives):\n- A Woman begging\n- Two Women\n- A Battle\n- A Falconer\n\n8878-1861 shows a tournament scene on the Piazza Grande (nowadays Piazza della Loggia, main square of the city) with the central arch of an \u2018all\u2019antica\u2019 loggia which frames the scene. In the middle distance Ferramola has depicted the square jousters poised to start their charge. All around, peering from balconies, loggias and balustrades, is a crowd of spectators waving banners. In the background are the loggetta and the clock tower, presumably decorated by Ferramola himself (if so, this scene may include a discreet self-advertisement). The Loggetta is adorned with the coats of arms of the past Venetian governors of Brescia whereas the lion of St. Mark was removed and sent to Milan by order of Louis XII in order to eradicate visible traces of the Venetian regime (Bona, 1997). \nUnder the loggetta\u2019s arcades Vincenzo Foppa (c.1427-c.1515) had painted the <i>Justice of Trajan</i>, now destroyed. On the right hand-side is a foreshortening of the Citadella Vecchia\u2019s wall and the tower of the Broletto in the distance. A similar view was executed in inlaid wood by Damiano Zambelli (act. 1520-1549) after cartoons by Bramantino (ca. 1460-1530), Bernardino Zenale (ca. 1464-1526) and other artists, currently preserved in the Church of S. Bartolomeo, Bergamo. \nThe women in the fresco are dressed in a typical Northern Italian style, their hairstyles and clothes recalling Leonardo\u2019s <i>Isabella d\u2019Este</i> in the Louvre, Paris. Two of them hold a \u2018spazzola\u2019, a fan made of feathers, which appears in other representations of 16th-century noble life.\n\nThe scene has been said to record the celebration given in honour of the visit, in 1497, of Caterina Cornaro (Fenaroli, 1877 and Lechi, 1974), Queen of Cyprus, to her brother Giorgio who was then Podest\u00e0 of the city (its Venetian governor). Fenaroli (1877) identified the joust with that of 1497, and Caterina as one of the women on the left and her brother as the bearded old man on the right (wearing a formal robe with wide sleeves \u2018alla dogalina\u2019). This proposal seems fanciful, as there is no documented relationship between the Calini and the Cornaro, and neither Caterina\u2019s features nor her brother\u2019s resemble those in the fresco. However, Ferramola may have witnessed the 1497 joust, and recalled it in this representation of a tournament.\nAnother hypothesis is that the fresco could represent the tournament to celebrate the betrothal of a member of the Calini family, as shown is another fragment representing a betrothal scene. An account of 1511 (see Pasero 1958, pp.56, 75 note 203) reports a lavish wedding celebration of a woman of the Calini family, which suggests that their finances survived the depredations of the French invaders (The sack of Brescia by Gaston de Foix took place in 1509). Mariotto Calini had inherited the building in 1508, at the death of his father Tonino. Although the date of Mariotto\u2019s wedding is not known, it may have occurred shortly before the birth of his first son in 1514. The dog and monkey in the foreground are common accessories in scenes of banquets and spectacles, but are also often associated with the theme of love as a game (Thomas 1999, p. 13, note 42; Janson 1952, pp. 174, 279).\nBrescia\u2019s main square was the principal location for such events during a period in which the city rivalled Milan as a principal Italian centre for the manufacture of arms and armour. The first joust was held there in 1441 in honour of Francesco Sforza, future Duke of Milan (Bona 1997, p. 151) and tournaments held there became customary from the 1480s onwards.\nThe whole decorative scheme is a fine example of the Lombard classicism in which are combined architectural elements (both real and painted) typical of the Renaissance, classical sources such as Ovid\u2019s <i>Metamorphoses</i> and emulation of the Northern school through the transposition of the monkey from Durer\u2019s engraving, made by Giovanni Antonio da Brescia, <i>The Virgin and Child with a monkey</i> (Bartsch VII.60.42) as well as the triton in the upper left lunette of the loggia  transposed from Nicoletto da Modena\u2019s print (Hind 11) (Buganza, 1998). \nFurthermore the taste for \u2018all\u2019antica\u2019 decoration is typical of the period. In the late 15th century, Roman inscriptions were unearthed in Brescia and displayed on the fa\u00e7ade of public buildings. Such archaeological \u2018spolia\u2019 informed a local humanist tradition, and was influential on artists. Similar decoration \u2018all\u2019antica\u2019 appears in a late Quattrocento frieze in the Palazzo Maggi-Gambara. In the 1520\u2019s, at the Palazzo Arco in Mantua, Giovanni Maria Falconetto elaborated further on this theme, decorating a <i>Zodiac Room</i> with an exaggerated architectural frame, abounding with similar antique motifs which represent the twelve signs of the Zodiac.\n\nThe dating of the fresco\u2019s cycle is still subject to debate. It was initially dated 1512 by Francesco Gambara (1820, p. 249-250) more recently confirmed by Gaetano Panazza who noted signs of the Emilian classical style of Lorenzo Costa (1460-Mantua) and Francesco Francia (ca. 1450-1517) whereas Roberto Longhi as well as Mina Gregori followed by F. Frangi and S. Buganza believe that the cycle is to be dated around 1517-8 because of its similarity with Boccaccino\u2019s <i>Meeting at the Golden Gate</i> in Cremona Cathedral, which was executed around that date. More recently Massimiliano Capella (E. Lucchesi Ragni, 2006) stated that Ferramola\u2019s Palazzo Calini frescoes show a considerably more complex painting style than those of his signed and dated works from between 1513 and 1522 and proposed an early date between 1510 and 1512. However it can hypothesised that Ferramola was assisted in the elaboration of his iconographic programme by a local humanist, a fact that would explain the relative complexity of the decoration. Ferramola could have therefore executed the frescoes at later date even though his other works look in the whole less elaborate.",

            "historical_context_note": "Fresco painting is among the most complex projects undertaken during the Renaissance. This technique, i.e. painting on wet plaster, originated in the Antiquity (see the surviving fresco of Pompeii, near Naples, destructed during the eruption of the Vesuvius in 79 B.C.), was reintroduced and developed in the late 13th century and the 14th century particularly in the work of the Isaac master, Giotto and his followers and perfected during the Italian Renaissance, culminating in Michelangelo's technological tour de force in the Sistine chapel, Rome (1508-12). This medium was used to decorate large wall areas of both private and public buildings. Such sizable paintings, in which timing was of critical importance, took careful planning and involved a number of assistants. A precise plan in the form of a drawing or of many drawings was required so that the composition would fit exactly on the wall. The artist could draw directly on the wet plaster (this underdrawing technique is called <i>sinopia</i>) or use cartoons (from the Italian word <i>cartone</i>) from which the composition was then transferred onto the wall. Another method of transfer, used especially in the 17th century for vast ceiling frescoes, was squaring, which replaced the time-consuming and costly cartoon technique.",
