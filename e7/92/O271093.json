Morris was the artist and designer who was the greatest single influence on the Arts and Crafts movement and the most successful textile designer and manufacturer of his day. Morris revived the craft of block printing and vegetable dyeing and in his own home he set up looms for tapestry weaving and the hand knotting of carpets. He was highly influenced by historical patterns and was one of the most knowledgeable textile historians of the late 19th century.\n\nMorris & Co. was founded by William Morris in 1875, producing textiles commercially for sale in two London shops. Alexander Morton established his textile company in Scotland in 1867 and manufactured silk and wool fabrics and gauzes for Morris & Co. until Morris set up his Merton Abbey Works in 1881, where he produced his own textiles.\n\nThis complex design was suitable for curtains and hangings and was available in different scales and colourings.",
