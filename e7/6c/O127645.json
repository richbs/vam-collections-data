This edition of The Opelousas Courier was printed in March 1864, in New Orleans, which, at the time, was under siege from the Union Army. This was a relatively common strategy at the time, when basics such as paper were in short supply.\n\nThe newspaper is of particular interest for two reasons. It carries what is possibly the last advertisement for slaves to appear in any American newspaper, while the wallpaper fragment itself lends a glimpse of how typical middle-class homes were decorated at the time.",
