The long tapering legs are slightly flexed at the knees, and the body is naked except for a light girdle which leaves the genitals exposed.   Attached to the girdle is  sheathed dagger.  The hair is dressed close to the crown in neat tresses, with a curl on top and a fillet of flowers across the front.  There are signs that the figure once had a tail, now missing.   The ears have small holes for the attachment of pendants, also missing.  Two necklaces are worn, the lower one possibly intended to be set with jewels or semi-precious stones.   The figure is fixed to a high multi-tiered and circular base, made in two separate sections then joined together and engraved with lotus petals.",
