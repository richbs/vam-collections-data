In the centre are inscribed the verses of Psalm 67 shaped as a Menorah (seven branched candelabrum), hence its second appellation: a Menorah  \nThe words of Psalm 16:8 are found in the two roundels at the top of the item, the Hebrew word for \"Lord\" being inscribed in bold black letters at the head of the scalloped section.\nThe two rosettes in the lower section of the object contain various blessings such as a blessing for entering and leaving a place, blessing for rain, etc.",
