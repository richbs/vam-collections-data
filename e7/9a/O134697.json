At Dunhuang, he studied and excavated the Han-dynasty watchtowers to the north of the town, as well as the Mogao cave temples to the southeast, where he acquired material from the Library Cave. From there he moved on to the northern Silk Road, stopping briefly at Turfan sites but not carrying out any excavations. He made a perilous north-south crossing of the Taklamakan desert in order to hasten to Khotan where he excavated more ancient sites, before finishing off his expedition with surveying in the Kunlun Mountains.",

Stein excavated the remains of a Buddhist temple there and found fragments of stucco sculptures and plaques. These were close in style to those of the Buddhist shrine at Aketerek, nearby, which had flourished in the third and fourth centuries. He also found what he termed \"Muhammedan\" coins and Sung Dynasty (960-1127 AD) cash pieces. He concluded that the temple site had flourished again in the early Islamic period, perhaps as an Islamic mazar, or shrine. A large number of bone fragments near the shrine suggested that the area had been used as burial ground at this time. The V&A holds, on loan, one fragment of a red terracotta vessel from Siyelik, dated from the fourth to the fifth century AD.",
