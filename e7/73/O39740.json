A poignant memory of the Jacobite Rising of 1745 in Scotland is evoked by plates and punchbowls decorated with soldiers in strangely depicted kilts, copied from prints or engravings of 1743 by George Bickham. The prints refer to the first mutiny of the Highland regiment on 18th July 1743 as the regiment sought to restore the descendants of the House of Stuart. During the mutiny a piper named Macdonnel (or Macdonald), perhaps the piper depicted, was sent to Georgia as a convict. Surviving pieces, such as this plate, show few signs of use because, although they must have been ordered before 1745, they arrived back after the Rising when rebellion had been totally crushed. A Chinese border surrounds the Scottish theme.",
