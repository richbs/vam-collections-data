His personal photographs of British  Caribbean community life in Hackney came to form the series Growing Up Black. \n\nThe series includes photographs that document London\u2019s sound system music scene in the 1970s. The sound system subculture first developed in Jamaica, as DJs rivalled to build the best speaker system offering the latest reggae and ska music for their performances. British Caribbean migrants brought the sound system concept to London in the 1960s, beginning at house parties known as \u2018Blues Dance\u2019 and later moving into clubs. \u2018Admiral Ken\u2019, in the foreground of this photograph, was a well known sound system operator, becoming the resident at the Bouncing Ball Club in Peckham during the 1970s. Morris has identified the man standing to the left of the van as \u2018the boxer Dennis Andries, who years later went on to become world light heavyweight champion.\u2019\n\nThe V&amp;A acquired ten photographs by Dennis Morris as part of the Staying Power project. Photographs by Charlie Phillips documenting people and places associated with London\u2019s early sound system music scene were also acquired as part of the project. Staying Power is a five year partnership between the V&amp;A and Black Cultural Archives. The project aims to explore black British experience from the 1950s to the 1990s through photographs acquired by the V&amp;A and oral histories conducted by Black Cultural Archives.",
