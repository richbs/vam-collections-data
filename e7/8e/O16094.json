Made in south-east China, the figure was the personal possession of a woman, who could pray to it for fertility, or give thanks to Guanyin for the birth of a son. Carved from imported African or Asian ivory, the figure's surface is coloured with red lacquer and gilding. Guanyin and the baby she holds both look downwards, in the direction of the sleeve ends of the deity's robe, giving the figure an air of contemplation.",
