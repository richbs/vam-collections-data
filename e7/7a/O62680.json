The ballet was premiered by Ballet Rambert at the Mercury Theatre in 1934 and revived at intervals over the next twenty years, but there is no surviving evidence that the Mermaid's costume was ever made with one shoulder bare.  The design came to the Museum as a gift from Maude Gosling, who as Maude Lloyd danced with Ballet Rambert and was a close friend of Andr\u00e9e Howard; she danced the role of the Mermaid herself later in the 1930s.  \nThe Cyril Beaumont Bequest also includes two costume designs by Andr\u00e9e Howard for the Mermaid, one of which (S.210-2000) shows a similar long dress but with supports over both shoulders.\n\nHistorical significance: An example of ballet design from the 1930s for the significant company Ballet Rambert.  Howard was one of the few choreographers who also designed her own works.",
