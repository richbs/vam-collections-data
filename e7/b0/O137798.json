The classic antique trowel shape is brought up to date and bears the artist's personal imprint on it.  In a characteristically humorous approach, Appleby has interpreted the trowel as a spade for shovelling cake.  The slice is also heart shaped;  the Queen of Hearts is also the queen of tarts.  Playfulness and practicality are in no way incompatible, as Appleby proves, playing with ideas as well as with forms.  He added a further personal touch for the commissioner, Seymour Rabinovitch, by engraving a letter monogram R on the butt of the handle.",
