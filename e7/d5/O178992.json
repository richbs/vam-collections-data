SE, pl 30, show a flock of the same pattern at Temple Newsam House, Leeds, which they date circa 1720. There has been support for a date circa 1745, when the Long Gallery was remodelled, but a reference from the memoirs of Lady Mary Meynell (1933), who lived there in the 19th century, states that it was hung in 1826. Possibly there was an 18th-century pattern, copied by a firm such as Cowtan & Sons, in the 1820s and 1830s.'\n\n\nFor the reference to SE given above, see:\nSugden, A. V., and Edmondson, J.
