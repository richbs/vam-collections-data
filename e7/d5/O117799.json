It tells of the angel Gabriel visiting the Virgin Mary to inform her that she will conceive, and give birth to, the Son of God.\n\nThis painting, by an unknown artist, has been inscribed on the pulpit with the date 1472. The composition of the Annunciation group, with the Virgin kneeling at the pulpit, is typical of German painting from about 1470-1500. However, the foliage background representing the tree of life, seems to belong to a later period. The face of the Virgin was probably also painted at a later date.\n\nIt seems likely that the work is a later imitation eclectically derived from sources of different dates. It is difficult to say whether it is of the nineteenth century or earlier. Certainly, it must have been painted before 1855, the year it was purchased by the V&A.",

London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, pp. 121-122, cat. no. 137\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n137 \nTHE ANNUNCIATION WITH THE TREE OF LIFE \nDated on pulpit lower right 1472 \nThe angel bears a scroll inscribed Ave Maria blenna (sic) gratium (sic) and there is a Hebrew inscription on the lectern. \nCanvas \n64 x 44 (162.5 x 111.5) \n1580-1855\n\nThis appears to be an imitation of a 15th century work. \nThe composition of the Annunciation group with the Virgin kneeling at the lectern is typical of German painting of the last quarter of the 15th century. However, the foliage background seems to belong to a later period. In general terms, it is similar to German textiles of ca. 1500 (cf. <i>The Circumcision</i>, tapestry, Halberstadt Cathedral; B. Kurth, <i>Die deutschen Bildteppiche des Mittelalters</i>, iii, 1926, p. 338; <i>The Mythical Chase of the Unicorn</i>, embroidered hanging, Tyrolese, V. & A. Museum, T.79-1919; cf. also the decorative engravings of Schongauer: J. Baum, <i>Martin Schongauer</i>, 1948, figs. 108-12). But the large blossoms with curling, forked strapwork terminals would seem to represent Mannerist rather than Gothic design and could hardly be earlier than ca. 1530-40. In any case they hardly fit with the date 1472. \nThe drapery of the Virgin in particular is treated in a perfunctory manner and her face is equally unconvincing as a 15th century work.

However, the foliage background seems to belong to a later period. In general terms, it is similar to German textiles of ca. 1500 (cf. <i>The Circumcision</i>, tapestry, Halberstadt Cathedral; B. Kurth, <i>Die deutschen Bildteppiche des Mittelalters</i>, iii, 1926, p. 338; <i>The Mythical Chase of the Unicorn</i>, embroidered hanging, Tyrolese, V. & A. Museum, T.79-1919; cf. also the decorative engravings of Schongauer: J. Baum, <i>Martin Schongauer</i>, 1948, figs. 108-12). But the large blossoms with curling, forked strapwork terminals would seem to represent Mannerist rather than Gothic design and could hardly be earlier than ca. 1530-40.
