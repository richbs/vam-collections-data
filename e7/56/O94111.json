In 1864 he was asked to evaluate the V&A's collection of 'Illuminations'. He criticised the collection because he thought that German and Italian illumination of the later medieval period was over-represented. He suggested that the Museum should commission him to make copies rather than collect expensive originals. It could choose from a list of famous manuscripts that he would supply.\n\nIn 1866 the V&A spent nearly \u00a3100 acquiring facsimile copies of well-known manuscripts. They added a new dimension to the V&A collection because they provided examples of Anglo-Saxon illumination. This is a copy from an Anglo-Saxon Gospel Book.",
