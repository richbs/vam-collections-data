This panel shows an intermediate stage of the creation of the design, with the relief decoration covered in metal foil and varnished to give the appearance of gilding and the background painted dark green.  A final stage of highlighting the foil areas may have been intended.  This panel has probably been reduced in size as all four sides are knife cut.  Two sides (the top and left) still show margins of approximately 1 cm outside the moulded area of the panel.",

The panels shows an intermediate stage. After the damp leather was pressed into a mould to create relief decoration, the raised ornament was covered with metal foil which was varnished to look like gold leaf, and the background was painted dark green.  It is possible that, in a later stage, the raised areas would have been given more detail with coloured varnishes or paints. This series of panels were made in about 1855 by the French firm of Jean Michel Dulud, who specialized in this technique.  They often used historic styles which were particularly fashionable at the time.  This design of curving, scrolling branches, was based on Gothic designs of the medieval period.  The Metropolitan Museum in New York has a chair of about 1850 (inventory number 1995.164) by the French furniture maker Jeanselme, which uses exactly this pattern of leather for the upholstery.",
