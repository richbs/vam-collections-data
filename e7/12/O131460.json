He never received any formal training in design or furniture making but was influenced by time spent at his father's painting and contracting firm during the 1900s.  Although he had no practical skills (even his drawings had to be put to scale by another draughtsman), he became famous for attention to detail and exquisite craftsmanship.  Ruhlmann sought inspiration in the neo-classical and revivalist trends in furniture from the late 18th and early 19th centuries.  He once said, 'Indeed, most of my works are of classical inspiration.  And I often happen to take my students to Versailles.  Naturally it is not to incite them to copy antiques.  One ought only to find inspiration in them, adapt them to our time.' The simple lines, rich materials and minimal ornament of this armchair illustrate Ruhlmann's modernised version of classical design where comfort, elegance and simplicity were foremost.",
