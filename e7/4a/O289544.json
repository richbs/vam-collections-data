The main lines of the design are tamboured in white cotton thread, and the leaves, birds and flowers, which are in undrawn muslin, are edged with over cast stitch and embroidered with stem, satin, button-hole and tambour stitches. Some of the leaves and other feathers are backed with a second layer of muslin to produce a denser fabric, whilst the centres of the large flowers and fruits and of the strap-work band are worked in a variety of drawn-fabric stitches.\n\nThe border is divided horizontally by a strap-work band in a form of the Greek-key pattern. The band is not continuous and at every break (approximately every 26 inches) there is an ornate vase of exotic flowers. Curving above and below the strap-work band are slender stems bearing pomegranates, leaves and flowers, and tied with ribbon bows. At the central point of each repeat, there are two birds perched amongst the leaves at the top of the border, and a bird-cage hanging from the strap-work band.\n\nThe lower edge is decorated with a border of machine-made looped net with a simple needle-red pattern.",
