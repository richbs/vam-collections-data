Whether by Thornhill or another artist, the drawing appears to date from about the first quarter of the eighteenth century. \n\nGiovanni Bologna's original group was set up in the garden of York House by the Duke of Buckingham in 1624 and it was still there in 1650.  Between about 1703 and 1714 it was moved to Buckingham House, where, according to Mackey in his <i>journey through England</i> (1714), it stood in the hall.  Some time after 1762, that is to say after the probably date of the drawing, it was given to Thomas Worsley by the king and moved to Hovingham Hall, Yorkshire.  It is now in the Department of Architecture and Sculpture, A.7-1954. \n\nThe drawing can hardly represent the garden of York House.  The statue shown in it must, therefore, be one of the replicas which are known to have been in England in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries by van Nost, Cheere and other sculptors.  One of the earliest copies recorded was bought by the Duke of Devonshire for Chatsworth in 1691 (see F. Thompson, <i>A History of Chatsworth</i>, 1950, p.235).  There are other replicas at Drayton House (illustrated in <i>English Homes,</i>, Period IV, Vol.I, 1928, Pl.332), Seaton Delaval (illustrated <i>ibidem</i>, Period IV, Vol.II, Pl.427), and Southill (see Major S. Whitbread, <i>Southill, A Regency House</i>, 1951, p.55).  But it is impossible to determine from the drawing which of the replicas it represents. \n\nFor the history of the marble group on England, see J. Pope-Hennessy <i>Samson and a Philistine</i>, Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1954, pp.13-16.\"",
