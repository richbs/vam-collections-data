Based on The Illuminatus Trilogy (a series of three novels written by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson and first published in 1975) the production was directed by Ken Campbell who decided to stage the books in their entirity, converting them into a cycle of five plays: The Eye of the Pyramid, Swift Kick Inc, The Man Who Murdered God, Walpurgisnacht Rock and Leviathan. Each play consisted of five 23-minute-long acts. \n\nThe production was first performed in Liverpool, opening in November of 1976, and Ken Campbell and Chris Langham set up 'The Science Fiction Theatre of Liverpool' to bring together the cast required for this ambitious venture.",
