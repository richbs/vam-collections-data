It has a slight train at the back and people were always treading on it! - but the material is still there and it would be easy to put it back to its right length.  Yesterday I hurriedly took off the rose (with black velvet stalk and leaves) and sewed it onto the white with black spot taffeta dress which had lost its rose.",
