The cross was acquired via a British expedition to Abyssinia (Ethiopia) led by Sir Robert Napier in 1868, which sought to free British subjects being held captive by the Ethiopian emperor Tewodros II (Theodore). The expedition marched to Tewodros\u2019s fortress at Magdala (Mek'dala) where a brief battle took place. Britain won the conflict, but not before the captives were released and Tewodros himself had committed suicide. The expedition passed near the great church at Chelicut where this cross was acquired.\n\nThe watercolour artist and journalist William Simpson accompanied British forces as a special artist for the Illustrated London News The expedition, which was a costly and complex affair, caught the imagination of the British public, and Simpson\u2019s sketches and illustrations formed a key part of its visual representation. This and another Ethiopian cross, plus several portfolios of Simpson\u2019s artwork were acquired by the South Kensington Museum (later V&A) after his death.",
