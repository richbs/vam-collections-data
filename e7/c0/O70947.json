These panels pivot on brass rods and can be adjusted to form a semi-transparent partition that is both decorative and functional. Eileen Gray probably based it on her design for the interior of an apartment in Paris. There a similar \u2018screen\u2019 of 450 panels lined the walls and extended part-way into the room.  \nOn this screen each panel is lacquered black and has a raised square in the centre. This detail gently enhances the surface and softens the overall severity of the geometric design.",
