Since the pieces were limited in size the portraits tended to be small, yet they could still be monumental in form. Jean Cavalier (1650/60-1698/9), a Hugenot, was a native of France, and perhaps a Protestant. He travelled extensively, working as a wax modeller and ivory sculptor, and specialising in portrait medallions. In the 16882/3 he went to London, where he stayed until 1686; he then went to Trier, perhaps Stuttgart, D\u00fcsseldorf, Hamburg, Hannover, Kassel, and in 1689 to Vienna, Munich and perhaps Dresden. By 1690 he was back in London, where he carved pictures of the King and Queen and was given the passport as the 'King's medallist'. He was then at the Danish Court in 1691/3, and from 1694/5-7 in Stockholm, from whence he and his brother Denis, also a sculptor, journeyed as ambassadors on behalf of Sweden to Russia and Persia, where they both died.",

This piece is in Temple Newsam, Leeds (Friedman 1981). These two pieces are the earliest known ivories of British subjects by the artist, and indicate that he may have come to England in 1684. Terry Friedman has speculated that he could have been brought over from France by the Duke of Grafton, following the latter's visit to the court of Louis XIV in 1684.\n\nBought for \u00a3613.25 from Bruton gallery under the John Webb Trust, in 1980.",
