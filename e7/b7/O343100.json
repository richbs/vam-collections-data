It captures the moment at which Shaykh San'an is offered a cup of wine by the Christian maiden, whom he had fallen in love with, while in Greece, and for whom he renounced his belief in Islam. He stooped so low that he tended her herd of pigs, considered unclean in Islam, which encouraged his disciples, surrounding him, to come to Greece to pray for his conversion back to Islam and his home in the Hijaz. He did return and was followed by the maiden who also converted to Islam. The poem was popular for its connection with Christianity and Europe, all threats to Islam, which segregates the sexes.\n\nIn the mid 19th century, tiles were sold  as individual objects for display, rather  than as multi-part friezes, many were  acquired by Western tourists and  visitors as souvenirs.  the style of the building and the maiden's clothing are typical of the Qajar period.",
