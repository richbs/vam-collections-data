Pupil of B R Haydon, with Charles Landseer, from 1816, and entered RA Schools 1820. Exhibited 38 works at the RA between 1828 and 1862, 135 at the BI 1824--64, and 47 at the SBA 1824-35. Most of his paintings \n\nwere still-life, usually fruit, but he occasionally showed portraits and subject pictures. Called by the Athenaeum critic (17 May 1856, p622) 'the very prince of fruit-painters'. Died Sunnyside, near Birkenhead, Merseyside, 18 June 1864. His studio sale was at Christie's 27 May 1873. There is a miniature portrait of him by Thomas Carrick in the V&A (Pl-1953). His daughter, Miss E Lance, was also a painter of fruit, exhibiting at the RA 1859-61; Sir John Gilbert and William Duffield were his pupils. \nLIT: \tArt Union 1847, p96 (with engr portrait after G Clint): Art Journal 1857, pp305-7; Illustrated London News 21 December 1861, pp647-8 (with engr portrait); Art Journal 1864, pp242-3 (obit) \n\nSelf Portrait 107-1873 \nPanel, 44.4 X 34.2 cm (171/2 X 131/2 ins) Purchased 1873 \nThis may be compared with the self-portrait in pencil and watercolour in the NPG. For the fullest published iconography see R Ormond Early Victorian Portraits 1973, I, p252. It is datable to about 1830, judging by the apparent age of the sitter. \nThe panel is composed of three pieces of wood joined vertically; in 1931 the right-hand join split and was not correctly aligned when reassembled, nor was the loss of pigment along the join replaced. \nPROV: G H Parker; purchased from him by the Museum 1873 \n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
