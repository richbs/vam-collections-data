The dress is cut with a slightly high waist and the fabric of the skirt forms part of the Watteau back of the dress, which recalls 18th-century sack-back styles. \n\nThe dress is mounted on a boned silk foundation to which is attached an inner straight silk half petticoat on which is a tulle underskirt with additional frill and an organdie petticoat with its flounce backed with net. This fastens at the centre back with hooks, eyes and a zip fastener. There is a waist band, but no signature.",

It was the only dress that remained unsold, and was donated to the V&A by the designer. We also have the very first wedding dress that Stiebel designed in 1932, forty years earlier, (see T.71-1966), so it is fitting that his last wedding dress should be in the collection alongside it.",
