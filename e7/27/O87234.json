They were made of sticks held together with a silk cord or ribbon.  Some bris\u00e9 fans accentuated the elaborate carving of the sticks. Others, like this example, were as pictorial as those made with a painted fan leaf.  The fan painter has illustrated this fan with The Finding of Moses, using rich colours and composition associated with the Baroque style.  Painting on bris\u00e9 fans was more difficult than painting a fan leaf.  The artist had to colour each individual stick carefully so that the whole composition connected properly when the fan was opened.",
