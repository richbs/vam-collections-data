The handle is in the form of a loop, so that the lower part offers support at the base.  The underside of the scoop is carved  in shallow relief with two addorsed fleur-de-lys motifs within hearts, inside a pointed oval border.  The edge of the scoop is carved with a zigzag border. This suggests that the scoop was designed for display on a hook or shelf when not in use. The underside is additionally carved with the initials 'GBT' in cursive script, probably a later addition to personalise it. The inside of the bowl is plainly carved, with visible tool marks, but is carefully shaped with a slightly thicker spine where the body meets the handle, for strength.",

            "public_access_description": "This wooden scoop, made in Norway probably in the early nineteenth century, might have been used for collecting grain from large storage chests for use in the kitchen.  In isolated farmsteads many household implements such as bowls and scoops were made by the farmers themselves, although there were also professional carvers who travelled the country selling their wares.  Norwegian folk art traditions were passed down from generation to generation in the stable rural communities, many farmers becoming skilled in carving.  Norwegian implements were typically carved from a single piece, exploiting the natural beauty and strength of the wood. This scoop is in no way naive but is subtly and pleasingly shaped, with a finely carved decoration on the underside of scrolls and fleur-de-lys shapes ultimately derived from the prevailing Baroque style. The carved initials, probably added later, suggest that the scoop was offered as a gift.  However it was highly practical, with a strong handle and the inside of the bowl plainly carved, with visible tool marks.",

A curator noted on file: 'I went to Valentines at Mr Inglesby's invitation, on Saturday last &amp; saw the remainder of his collection of Norwegian objects, which he has gathered together during his travels in Norway.  On the whole, the specimens which he has left at the Museum appear to me to be a very fair selection from his collection, most of the forms being represented as well as the designs.' \n\nRichard Adamson, curator, wrote on 6th October 1891: 'This is a very interesting collection of Norwegian examples of wood carving and would be of use for circulation to schools.  The price asked is very reasonable. I recommend the purchase of the selection made. The total is \u00a366.0.0.' The 54 objects selected are museum numbers 569 to 602-1891. Six further objects were sent to the Museum of Science and Art at Edinburgh, and five to Dublin Museum. Registered File: Ingleby, Herbert.\n\nCollections of Norwegian folk art were formed both in Norway and elsewhere in Europe and America from the 1880s.  In Norway folk arts were seen as symbolic of Norwegian nationalism, since Norway was still under Swedish rule until it gained independence in 1905.  In Norway there was increased interest in traditional culture. Collecting and displaying peasant folk art in national museums, particularly the Norsk Folkemuseum near Oslo, founded in 1894, and the development of 'Husflid' (literally \u2018House Industry\u2019) was seen as a way of promoting Norway's economic development.  In other parts of Europe, designers looked to Norwegian peasant crafts as a relatively untouched folk tradition.  Wooden artifacts were admired for the visual impact of their bold and simple designs.",
