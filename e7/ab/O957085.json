            "history_note": "Jan de Bisschop (1628-1671), also known as Johannes Episcopius, was a Dutch painter and printmaker. He first studied to be become a lawyer but then abandoned the profession in order to study art with Bartholomeus Breenbergh (1598 c.-1657 c.), a Dutch painter specialising in Italianate landscapes. In 1656 de Bisschop took part in the foundation of the Confrerie Pictura, a club of artists, in The Hague. \nHe was particularly interested in the teaching of art and this resulted in his making two series of prints based on classical statues and on sixteenth and seventeenth century artists for students to draw from. The first of these suites is the Signorum Veterum Icones which was published by Nicolaes Visscher in two parts in 1668 and 1669 while the Paradigmata Graphices variorum artificum in 1671. The two volumes of the Icones were subsequently published in one single edition, together with the Paradigmata. The Icones comprises of a suite of 100 plates of reproductive prints of sculptures, including a large number of well known statues of the Greek and Roman period. The second suite, the Paradigmata, consists of 57 reproductive plates of paintings and sculptures by Italian and Dutch sixteenth and seventeenth century artists. \nThis plate was acquired by the Museum along with eight other prints from the Icones (Museum numbers 29627.61-29627.69).     \nThe print shows the Apollo Belvedere in reverse to the sculpture, turning to his right rather than his left. When the statue was found, in late 15th century, parts of both arms were missing and were replaced by the Italian sculptor Giovanni Angelo Montorsoli (1507-1563). The 16th century restoration was removed in the twentieth century due to the controversy about the authenticity begun in the 19th century. Now the statue looks slightly different, even if the Apollo has been integrated again, so that De Bisschop\u2019s print is particularly important as proof of the Renaissance integration.\nThe Apollo del Belvedere was one of the most famous ancient statues in the 16th and 17th centuries. From its discovery generations of artists and draughtsmen studied and drew from it. The statue was also the inspiration for many figures in paintings. In the Signorum Veterum Icones it is represented twice and from two different angles (see plates number 4 and 5).",
