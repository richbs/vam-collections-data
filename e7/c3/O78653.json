The pistol is the only surviving  16th-century wheel-lock (a system of ignition operated by a revolving wheel) that was certainly made in England.  It has also come down to us with most of its original delicate gold and silver damascened (inlaid) decoration still remaining.\n\nDesign & Designing\nSeveral features identify this wheel-lock as of English workmanship.  The ornament on the stock  (the support that holds the barrel) can be compared to English textiles and other English 16th-century firearms.  The shape of the butt is similar to that on other English 16th-century pistols and the damascened decoration on the lock and barrel is very similar to that on a small box  dated 1579 that was made for Robert Dudley, 1st  Earl of Leicester, Elizabeth I's favourite courtier.  The lock is also fitted with a safety catch of English form.\n\nPeople\nLike the flask and musket, this wheel-lock pistol originally belonged to Sir William Harris of Shenfield House, Essex.  At some date in its history the interior mechanism of the lock was altered by an unskilled hand.",
