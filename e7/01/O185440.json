E.333-1962\n\nThe domineering Empress takes her husband by the nose as she burns two letters from his mistress, one saying: <i>mon empreur mon prince ton enfant se porte bien mouchy sera contente Bellanger</i> and the other <i>mon gros chien ta femme est une vielle b\u00eate si elle net e laisse pas sortir ce soir. je t\u2019attends Marguerite Bellanger</i>. In fact Eug\u00e9nie is said to have felt no sexual jealousy, but disapproved of the damage this liason wrought with the Emperor\u2019s health. One evening when he returned from Marguerite in a state of collapse Eug\u00e9nie confronted her in her house at Passy. After withstanding the criticism that she should be able to keep her husband at home with her own charms, she explained her less selfish motives for trying to prevent the Emperor\u2019s visits; shortly afterwards the affaire came to an end.'\n<u>Victoria & Albert Museum Department of Prints and Drawings and Department of Paintings, Accessions 1962</u>.

One evening when he returned from Marguerite in a state of collapse Eug\u00e9nie confronted her in her house at Passy. After withstanding the criticism that she should be able to keep her husband at home with her own charms, she explained her less selfish motives for trying to prevent the Emperor\u2019s visits; shortly afterwards the affaire came to an end.",
