On one side the cross is silver-gilt decorated with pounced motifs; on the other there are 10 oval niches which alternate with applied oval enamelled plaques (the three niches across the arms of the cross are larger than the rest). The niches are for relics; seven of them are intact and contain a fragment of textile (?red velvet) behind a glass or crystal window. The large central oval in the centre of the cross appears to contain cotton wool and fragments of painted plaster. In the centre on the non-relic side of the cross, the metal has been knocked and distorted on one side.",
