At the end of their tuition their guru Sandipani, shown seated with his wife, asked as his teaching-price the return of his drowned son. Krishna and Balarama drove their chariot to the coast, slew the marine demon who had killed the boy, then went to Yama, the god of death, who returned the child to them.",
