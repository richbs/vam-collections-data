Binns in the early 20th century.  As well as theatrical subjects, Binns drew cartoons of political figures, and had associations with two predominant caricaturists of this period, Sir Francis Carruthers Gould and Harry Furniss.\n\nAlbert Chevalier (1861-1923) was born Albert Onesime Britannicus Gwathveoyd Louis Chevalier in Notting Hall, London, and in 1877 at the age of 16 began training as an actor with the Bancrofts in London.  He also played dramatic parts at the Court Theatre for 14 years, but he really made his name from 1891 onwards as a music hall and variety performer, singing songs he composed himself including his great hit: My Old Dutch.",
