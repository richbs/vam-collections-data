His Untitled series of 1998-2003 combines scenes of brooding adolescents with landscape views on the periphery of towns. Isolation and dislocation are common themes. In this no-man's land, meanings, morals and behaviours shift and the figures on the cusp of adulthood symbolise a state of transition.",
