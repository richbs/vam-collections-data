Horse racing, and in particular steeplechasing, gave rise to a new design of playing board. This is often folded in three rather than two. The playing surface is long and oval-shaped, and the playing spaces are narrow and angled. The basic rules of race games are still used however, with turns missed and players moving backwards and forwards as directed.\n\nIn this game greyhounds take the place of horses. It is played in a slightly different manner, because the hare must be advanced on its own track at the same time as the dogs. This is achieved by using two dice of different sizes, the smaller one for the hare. The dogs are moved by the players individually when their turn comes round, but the hare is moved at each throw of the dice. The metal dogs and hares were made by Britains Ltd, a company famous for their lead figures.",

Losing a turn is also the penalty if a dog lands in a compartment already occupied as `it is supposed a fight ensues'.  \nThe playing surface shows an oval track which is divided into 4 running tracks and numbered 1 to 86 with 87 to 100 doubling with 1 to 14.  The outer track is for the hare and the inner 3 tracks for the dogs  In the top corners are illustrations of dogs and in the bottom corners illustrations of hares.\n\nGREYHOUND RACING\nAs many players can take part as there are dogs.\nThe hare does not belong to any player, but is moved by each player every time a dog is moved, the game being won when a dog falls on the same division as the hare, or, in the event of this not happening, by the dog that reaches the Winning Post first.\nThere are two dice||||:  a large one containing numbers up to 6, belonging to the dogs and a small one containing numbers 1 and 2 only belonging to the hare.\n\nRULES\nBoth dice are thrown together by each player.\nFor 3 players the dogs start at the Starting Place, while the hare starts at No. 8.\nFor 2 players the dogs start at the Starting Place, while the hare starts at No. 12.\nFirst move the hare the number of points shown on the snall dice; then the dog is moved the number of points shown on the large dice.\nDogs cannot pass the hare.  If a throw brings a dog beyond th hare, the dog does not move, but remians where it is.\nif a dog moves on to a hurdle number it must stay until the player throws an odd number, but the hare is moved every time.\nIf a dog falls on a division occupied by another dog, it is supposed a fight ensues and it loses a turn but the hare dice is thrown alone.\nThe game ends either by a dog fallin on the same division as the hare, or, if this does not occur, by the first dog reachig the Winning Post.\n\nNOTE:  When the hare passes the Winning post, only throw the large dice for the dogs.\n\nRules placement: pasted to the inside of the lid",
