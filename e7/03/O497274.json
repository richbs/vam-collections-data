            "physical_description": "Vase. Research by Maria Fabrizi \u2013 Feb. 1988: This vessel is probably Japanese (R.K). It has two handles made up of free rings suspended from masks and loops. These handle \u2018bosses\u2019 may have been soldered to the vase body. The rings are made separately, and may have been formed from strips of hammered metal. The vase has an inset circular base plate, and the body seems to have been in two parts. The upper part has apparently been wedged into the lower portion. The top half has a band of decoration , seemingly formed by casting. It has probably been made using the \u2018lost wax\u2019 casting method. There is a repair in the base area, and the vase is worn in the region of the handles. The surface is generally chocolate brown and shiny, and has the appearance of lacquer. It is worn in patches, and there are some paler areas. The interior has some greyish incrustation, particularly in the upper portion.\nAnalyses were carried out, using non-intrusive EDXRF methods. Four area were investigated. These were the upper body in the band below the decoration, and the lower body in a plain area near to the join with the upper part, as well as the base plate and one of the handle bosses. The results showed that the base plate was quite different  from all the other parts, in that it was formed from almost pure copper, with a leaf impurity. It has probably been made from sheet metal. The upper and lower parts of the body were both formed from similar materials, in that they ate mixtures of copper and lead. However, the upper portion had a much greater lead concentration. This may reflect a situation where the compositions are different from each other, or it may be that there has been massive lead segregation. The lower part apparently has a considerable arsenic impurity, and so might really be quite a different metal. Both have iron as an impurity. The handle boss has a very similar composition to the lower part of the body, including the arsenic and iron impurities.",
