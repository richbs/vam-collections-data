            "physical_description": "Walnut cassone in the form of sarcophagi, boarded construction on poplar? carcase\n\nDove-tailed plank construction with mitred corners, the bottom looks like two planks nailed up. \nThe carved ends are basically a single shaped carved plank of cushion form between the base to the gadrooned moulding. The right hand end  is the cushion moulding not a single piece but consists of one large element with a section (5.5cm) glued at the back. Above it is a single cavetto moulding (main piece of carving 35cm high, cavetto 8cm high). Below the main cushion moulding is a narrow torus moulding nailed to conceal the edges of the bottom boards. The main cushion moulding is attached to a wedge-shaped spacing plank. \nThe back consists of three planks, scrub-planed on the  middle plank, pit-sawn on the lower plank. Each end consists of two glued planks; the front appears to be three planks: a narrow strip at the top, a deep central plank and a narrow plank at the bottom. The lid is held on three ring hinges apparently original. The construction of the lid is a frame of end-lapped construction to which walnut moulded and mitred elements are applied all around, and a single top walnut plank with an ovolo moulding all around. It overhangs the back of the chest by 4.5cm.\nThe four feet are in the form of a lion paw each with a scroll ankle. Those at the front set at 45 degrees, those at the back at 90 degrees.\n\nNo obvious repairs visible; front left foot broken and detached as well as a detached section at the front left corner. \nLock apparently original. Some water damage on the top. A dark stain all over. Contains a detached walnut section of a moulding from another object lost (71cm x 9.7cm) with egg-and-dart carving\n\nAs with 6002-1859 there is a worrying lack of wear on feet, hinges, locks. The carved surfaces seem even, regular and lifeless, where 16c would not be.\nBoth need to be examined under good light.",
