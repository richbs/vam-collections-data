Together with busts, manifestly by the same sculptor and on identical pedestals, but all unsigned, of the Rt. Hon George Grenville, The Rt. Hon Thomas Grenville, Richard Grenville Marquess of Burckingham, Louis Grenville and William Wyndham Lord Grenville, it passed to Captain Fortescus by descent. \n\nIn the Stow sale catalogue of 1848 are listed, as in the Grenville drawing room, marble busts of Comolli of William Wyndham, Lord Grenville (sold to Marquess of Chandos), Rt. Hon Thomas Grenville (sold to the Earl of Ellesmere) and the late Duke of Gloucester (sold to the Marquess of Chandos).",
