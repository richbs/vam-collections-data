John Gielgud saw his work and invited Andreu to create the costumes and settings for Much Ado About Nothing at Stratford-upon-Avon in 1949.  The production was a great success and was toured and revived in Stratford and London. Andreu went on to design a number of productions in Britain during the 1950s, including All's Well That Ends Well at Stratford, and Berlioz's opera The Trojans at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden.\n\nHamlet was directed by Alec Guinness and Frank Hauser, with Guinness as the Prince. Peter Wyngarde was The Third Player, who acts the part of the murderer Lucianus. The production was not well received but reviewers admired Andreu's Elizabethan costumes.",
