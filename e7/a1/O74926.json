Additionally there is a vertical strip of material inserted down the centre back and lining. The <i>yogi</i> is a coverlet not an article of apparel.\nThe garment is of plain weave printed cotton (<i>sarasa</i>) with a small-scale design of checks containing flowers in brown, blue, yellow and green with a brown speckled ground. On the back, at the top, reserved in the natural un-dyed cotton is a large crest (<i>mon</i>). The lining, which also forms a very deep wadded hem (27 cm) and cuffs is dark green plain weave cotton.\nAll the seams have decorative stitching of alternate long and short running stitches in dark green twisted thread and there are further pale green quilting stitches in untwisted thread running across the garment. Both sets of stitching help to keep the wadding in place.",
