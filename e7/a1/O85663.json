The evening coat is slightly fitted at the waist and has wide sleeves, tapering at cuffs. The stole in the shape of a short cape, tapering slightly at the ends.\n\nThe evening coat is a stunning example of designer Elsa Schiaparelli's experimenting with unusual fabrics and substances, never before connected with women's clothes. Schiaparelli viewed clothing as a type of architecture and believed it should have a strict neatness, with angles replacing feminine curves. This ensemble shows how Schiaparelli excelled in conjuring striking eveningwear with modern, forceful lines and a stylised simplicity.",

As the skirt expands in volume the strips, first two, and then three, are woven in a basket weave to make strips of graduated sizes, largest  about 3\u201d wide at hem, which are sewn together. Texture is created by the raised strip as it turns over at edges.\n\tPhoto notes: \n\tWeave detail 3: Each strip is 2 pieces gold braid plaited together  \n\tWeave detail and weave detail 4: basket weave of two, then three strips \n Sleeve: The huge bulbous sleeves are narrow at the armhole and narrow again at the sleeve opening.  Very unusual shape for a sleeve.\n\n\t Cape collar detail2 : given where the hooks and eyes are on this it seems the collar was intended to be  tight around the neck , but stiffness and size of it make it physically rather improbable.  \n\nJan G.
