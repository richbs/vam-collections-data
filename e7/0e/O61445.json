Members of the Guild included the architect, A.H. Mackmurdo, and Henry Horne, a designer and collector. One of their commissions was for Pownall Hall, Cheshire, a house extended and refurnished by the owner, Henry Boddington. In 1886 Boddington commissioned interior decoration, panelling, metal light fittings and furniture from the Guild, including this settle which was placed in the drawing room. It was probably designed by Mackmurdo, with fabric designed by Horne, and made for the Century Guild by E. Goodall of Manchester.",
