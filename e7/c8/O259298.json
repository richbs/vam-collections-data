The most famous copperplate printing factory was propitiously located at Jouy-en-Josas, half way between Paris and Versailles, the main residences of the French court \u2013 and the most desired market for these expensive furnishings textiles. \n\nAt the end of the century, aristocratic nostalgia for country life was epitomised by the pursuits of the French Queen Marie Antoinette who played at being a shepherdess in the house and dairy specially built for her in the grounds of Versailles, the little Hameau (hamlet) at the Trianon. \n\nAmong scenes of romantic love and child rearing, working men and women at leisure, a game of blind man's buff is shown. This scene was probably inspired by an oil painting by the famous French court artist Jean Honor\u00e9 Fragonard, painted around 1755-56 and  now preserved in the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio.",

            "historical_context_note": "The V&A collection of French printed cottons dating to 1760-1830 comprises more than 500 textile fragments. Over 300 pattern books contain 300,000 designs of French printed cottons from the 18th to 20th centuries. These collections were largely shaped by acquisitions from three sources: Dr Robert Forrer, a Swiss-born archaeologist and antiques dealer (V&A acquisition in 1899), Madame Mayoux, a Parisian gallery owner and collector (V&A acquisitions in 1919) and Sara Lee Courtaulds (donation of Courtaulds' archive of pattern books, including eight from Oberkampf's factory at Jouy, in 2000). Other examples have been acquired by textile curators.",
