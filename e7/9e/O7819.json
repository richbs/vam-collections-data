It is thought to have come from the house at Cowick Barton in Devon, built by John Russell, 1st Earl of Bedford (1485-1555). The royal coat of arms was widely represented in windows of the period, both in the monarch's own residences and in those of his subjects, who sought to advertise their allegiance to the Crown in this way.\n\nPeople\nRussell was a favourite of Henry VIII, serving as the King's mediator and as commander of his armies during the wars with France. His allegiance to the King was further evident on Henry VIII's death, when Russell acted as one of the executors of the monarch's will. Created Earl in 1550 by Edward VI (ruled 1547-1553), Russell later served as Lord High Steward and Keeper of the Privy Seal.\n\nMaterials & Making\nDuring Henry VIII's reign (1509-47) glaziers still used true stained glass, cutting and leading it together in complex heraldic designs. Here the golden fleurs-de-lis, made from clear glass painted with a silver stain, have been inserted into intricate holes drilled through the blue ground. 'Flashed' ruby glass (clear glass covered with a red glass layer which was then scratched to reveal the white below) has also been used. This in turn was sometimes painted, as can be seen in the centres of the roses.",

It was dissolved in 1538/9 and the manor and its holdings were granted to  Sir John Russell who became Baron Russell, was appointed Lord President of the Council of the West and was made a knight of the garter in that same year.\nCowick Barton, an Elizabethan mansion in outward form (now a pub), was erected on the lands formerly held by Cowick Priory. It is believed that the mansion was built in 1540 and by John Russell. It is possible that Cowick Barton was originally one of the priory buildings and was rebuilt around 1540 by John Russell. \nIt would be expected practice to include armorials in the glazing.\n\nThis panel was one of 6 English heraldic panels bought from Radford's stained glass collection. It was purchased for 100 pounds.",
