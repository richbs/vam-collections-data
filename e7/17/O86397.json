The flowers  with accompanying buds comprise two stems of pink, one orange and one mauve single petalled (<i>dianthus</i>), plus a pink carnation at the apex of the group.  In addition there is an orange and yellow single marigold and a six-petalled yellow flower with two stems of serrated pinnate leaves which  branch out on either side.  The detailing is achieved by outlines and loose hatching in darker colour tones or in contrasting pigments (that of the mauve <i>dianthus</i> flower being achieved by red detailing over a blue ground, while the yellow flower has orange detailing over a yellow ground).\n      The painting has an inner border created by strips of blue-grey paper outlined in black with two additional black lines added to the main ivory-coloured plain border.  The paper strips have been cut out in a crude fashion with uneven edges.  The main border has buff-coloured strips of paper stuck to its edges with two black lines on the inner sides. The inner edge of the page has a strip of beige-coloured woven textile added as a gutter for the binding.",

It contains 62 leaves on which are Mughal miniature paintings, drawing and flower studies on both sides. The binding is covered with an Indian brocade silk that may have been cut from lengths brought home by the 2nd Lord Clive, who served as Governor of Madras, 1799 to 1803.  The album was sold from Powis Castle at Sotheby's sale, 16 to 18 January 1956, lot 332A.",
