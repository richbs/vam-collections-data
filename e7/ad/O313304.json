This relief represents the Charity and is framed with other Harmers reliefs. (A7, A11, A12, A 13 and A13A-1919) This Charity relief is recorded by Alexander as being used in memorials found at Heathfield, Hurstmonceaux, Mayfield and Warbleton.\n\nThe reliefs were commonly inserted as ornamental decoration into the top section of a memorial, and were produced by Harmer in his native village of Heathfield. A variant of this relief was used twice on a memorial together with an example of the cherub relief. \n\nJonathan Harmer (1762-1849) was the son of Jonathan Harmer Senior (d. 1800) who bequeathed to his two sons Jonathan Jr and John 'all such Portland and other stone, together with my working Tools and utensils belonging to the Trade of a Stone Mason and Bricklayer, and Land Surveying Books.' In 1796 Jonathan Jr. left for America, settling in New York, where he worked with a mason and painter, returning to Heathfield in May 1800. His younger brother John had previously settled in New York, but also later returned to Heathfield. Jonathan Harmer Junior was working at Heathfield, Sussex, from 1800 till about the middle of the 19th century. He made reliefs by pressing a local terracotta into moulds. The squeezes were then touched up by hand and baked in a wood oven. A complete set of Harmer's terracotta reliefs is in the possession of the Sussex Archaeological Society at Lewes.",

Lister in 1919. \n\nWilliam Cleverly Alexander J.P. of Heathfield Park; Heathfield purchased pottery and notebooks remaining at Portland Square, Heathfield (the family home of the Harmer family) sometime after September 1897. According to Lucas, \"The stock consisted of a great number of the vases and paterae, two of the angel...., but with crown and rays, also the crown by itself, and one new pattern - a small coat-of-arms, those of the second Duke of Newcastle, Clinton, with Pelham in pretence'. These were inherited by Miss W.T. Lister, Heathfield Park, from her father, and she subsequently (in 1919) gave the present piece, together with cat. nos. 447 to 459, to the Museum, from this stock. Miss Lister also gave three examples of Harmer's pottery to the Department of Ceramics and Glass. A complete set of the pottery reliefs produced by Harmer was given in 1908 by Mr Alexander to the Archeological Museum of Sussex, now Sussex Archeological Society, located at Barbican/Anne of Cleves House, Lewes.",
