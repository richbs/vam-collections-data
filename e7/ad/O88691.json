Both the materials and the design of this box show the influence of the Islamic world upon the manufacture of luxury objects in Italy in the 16th century. The trade routes between states like Venice and the cities of the eastern Mediterranean resulted in a two-way cultural exchange that profoundly affected art and design. The geometric inlay of coloured woods and bone is similar in style to the designs found on Islamic woodwork.",
