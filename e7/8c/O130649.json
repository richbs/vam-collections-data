The furniture was commissioned from Ronald Carter, who in 1971 had been appointed a Royal Designer for Industry for his furniture design. The New Restaurant later gained notoriety as the 'Ace caff with quite a nice museum attached', as promoted in a late-1980s advertisement for the V&A. The furniture entered the catalogue of its Derbyshire-based manufacturer, Peter Miles Furniture Ltd, as the Buxton range, and was specified for other museum cafes including the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford.\n\nThe simple right-angular joinery of this furniture derives from Arts and Crafts traditions. Nothing is superfluous and there is no decoration. The chairs were identical to the stools, with the addition of simple back rails, and the flat stools were just as serviceable as small tables. The design of this coat stand is sophisticated but appears deceptively simple.  The arms are arranged in two crosses and each arm emerges from a different facet of the solid octagonal column. This was one of six coatstands specified for the restaurant. The furniture was particularly durable and remained in service in the New Restaurant until its closure in November 2006.",
