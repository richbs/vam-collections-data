(some col.).\nExhibition catalogue\n<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, pp. 190, 195, 196\nThe following is an extract from the text of the entry:\n \n\"The canvas was relined in 1893. \nThe view is taken near the pond at the Vale of Health, looking over to Highgate: \nEast Heath Road near Squire's Mount is on the extreme right. \nThis painting has hitherto been considered to be the view of Hampstead Heath exhibited by Constable at the Royal Academy in 1827, but there is no corroborative evidence for this identification, though it goes back before the receipt of the picture in the Museum, to the undated hand-list of c.1850, <i>The Collection of Pictures formed by John Sheepshanks Esq</i>., and therefore represents the opinion of Sheepshanks, the purchaser and donor (see also note to No. 301 [FA 35]). However, Holmes, p. 248, expressed doubts about the supposed date of exhibition and suggested on grounds of style that the picture was probably painted in 1821 or 1822. If the painting is in fact an exhibited work, it may have been the 'Hampstead Heath' shown by Constable at the Royal Academy in 1822; but it has no stronger claim to be identified with that work than some other pictures of the same locality, such as that acquired by the Fitzwilliam Museum from the Eckstein Collection, which is of the same style and size. There is in fact no certainty that the painting was exhibited at all; and it bears no labels of the kind found on Nos. 254 [FA 33], 301 [FA 35] and 352 [1631-1888], all of which were exhibited at the Royal Academy. In his letter of 7 October 1822 to Fisher, Constable refers to a painting of 'Green Highgate' (Beckett, VI, p. 98). Nothing is known of its composition, but since Highgate is seen in the middle distance of No. 323 [FA 36] it is conceivable that Constable may have been referring to this work. It is not known when Sheepshanks acquired the painting. Beckett (IV, p. 119) suggests that it may have been one of the two pictures by Constable belonging to Sheepshanks which were seen by Lord Northwick at Tiffin's Gallery in 1835. This identification could only be alternative to the supposition that No. 301 [FA 35] was one of the pictures in question, since the second was 'The Church' (see note to No. 301 [FA 35]); another possibility is that No. 323 [FA 36] may have been Lot 53 at the Executors' sale, 16 May 1838- 'Hampstead Heath, at the Ponds', bought by Tiffm for \u00a337 5s. 6d. (Tiffin bought 'Salisbury Cathedral from the Bishop's Grounds' (No. 254 [FA 33]) for Sheepshanks at the same sale.)\"\nEvans, M., with N. Costaras and C. Richardson, <u>John Constable.
