Volume II. 17th-18th century</u>, London, 1979, p. 103 The following is the full text of the entry: A miracle of St Anthony of Padua: a newborn babe tells his doubting father that he is his legitimate son Inscribed in ink in an old hand 'il miracolo del fanciulo che parlo al padre confessando esser suo figlio'; inscribed on the back in pencil in a modern hand 'Dom. de Castelfranco' and again 'Knowles Coll'\" Pen and ink and wash 9 3/8 x 5 (239 x 127) E\u20223971-1919 PROVENANCE E. V. Utterson (Lugt 909); W. Russel (Lugt 2648; sale, Christie, 10-12 December 1884, probably in one of the miscellaneous lots bought by Sir J. Knowles); Sir J. Knowles (sale, Christie, 29 May 1908, probably included in lot 197, a miscellaneous lot, bought by Webb); Bernard H. Webb Bequest 1919 The former attribution to the little known Venetian painter Domenico da Castelfranco seems improbable. The inscription on the back may perhaps refer to Pietro Damini da Castelfranco (1592-1631), who spent most of his working life in Padua. The mother of the child in the drawing, standing there with her hands crossed on her breast, is reminiscent of the mother in Titian's picture of the same subject in the Scuola del Santo at Padua.",
