The two children, aged 10 and 12, were given medals on 31st December 1890 for their \"daring and clever performances on the trapeze\"  and  the Bootle Times further records \"they were publicly presented with a gold medal by several admiring patrons\". They performed at Elphinstone's Circus in Bootle from December 1890 to April  1891. The family name was Munday but Fitzroy, Fred's middle name became his professional name.  His sister used the name Miss Adeline Patty. Her family name was Adeline Martha Munday. \n\n The V&A was given a small collection of medals awarded to Fred Fitzroy and a photograph of him aged about 12 is in the Theatre Museum. The medal itself was mass produced by a manufacturer in Birmingham and then probably commissioned from a local jeweller in Bootle. It was specially engraved to present to Fred (and presumably an identical medal for his sister) in recognition of outstanding performances.",
