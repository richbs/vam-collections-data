(1815-1884), former Governor of Bombay, in 1877. IM.84-1916 is another and larger fragment from the same frieze.\n  As John Guy writes in The Peaceful Liberators (see reference below) the high degree of stylistic uniformity suggests that these pieces were collected from a single temple, or at least from sites that were contemporary.  They are related to known Solanki dynasty temples of the 11th and 12th centuries: inscriptions record that endowments were made to the Shatrunjaya temples during the reign of Siddharaja Jayasimha (1095-1142), a Solanki ruler renowned for his patronage.\n  A similar sculpture of Ambika, sitting on a lion with a second son on her left is at Navgaja, Alwar, Rajasthan, illustrated in Jain, J. and Fischer, E., <u>Jaina Iconography</u>, part two, Leiden, 1978p. 41, pl.
