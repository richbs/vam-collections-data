We know this because it bears a mark that names the potter and a room in the home of the patron who ordered it.\n\nSubject Depicted\nThe teapot was made for a Chinese client and has specifically Chinese symbolism and writing. However, it ended up in Europe, where it was embellished with silver-gilt mounts. By contrast, many teapots that reached Europe were designed with more simple shapes, and without decoration with special symbolic meaning. The prunus design was popular on both imported and home-produced wares. \n\n",
