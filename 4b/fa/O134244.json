Williams also drew inspiration from the stories and symbols of the indigenous peoples of Guyana although his artistic practice defies simple classification as either \u2018Caribbean\u2019 or \u2018British\u2019.\n\n\u2018Sacrifice\u2019, a gouache on paper, is typical of Williams\u2019 work in its energy and colour. Painted in 1987, it follows a body of work entitled the Olmec-Maya series which sought to uncover the elemental forces lying behind pre-Columbian iconography. The title of this work may allude to Mayan practices of human sacrifice. Williams admired the technological achievements of the Maya but read the premature collapse of Mayan civilisation as a warning to contemporary society about its dependence on technology. He saw his work as a \u2018synthesis of ... two things, a modern consciousness that incorporates our Maya past and also considers our human future.\u2019 (Third Text, 1987)",
