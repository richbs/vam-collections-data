They were probably intended to be displayed on wall brackets or larger pieces of furniture in domestic interiors. Advertisements placed by the Bow factory, where this one was made, mention their use on 'Mantel-pieces' and ladies' dressing tables. Porcelain figures were also set out on dining tables during the dessert course of grand dinners, but there is no firm evidence that English theatrical figures were used in this way. Both this figure and a companion piece made for it of the actress Kitty Clive are frontally posed, so they were probably displayed against a wall.\n\nPeople\nThe figure shows the actor Henry Woodward (1714-1777) in the role of the 'Fine Gentleman' in David Garrick's popular farce Lethe. In the first production of  Lethe in 1740 Woodward played a different character, 'the Beau', but took the part of the 'Fine Gentleman' when Lethe was revived at London's Drury Lane in 1748. The companion figure made for it shows Kitty Clive performing in the same play as the 'Fine Lady'.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThis porcelain figure is copied from a mezzotint by James McArdell (1728-1765), which was in turn based on a drawing by Francis Hayman (1708-1776), a painter with close connections to the Drury Lane Theatre.",
