It is entirely made of a composite material called Mader\u00f3n, a mixture of resin and ground almond shells developed by a chemical engineer, Silio Cardona, from 1980. The shells were a waste product of the Spanish almond industry.\n\nThe Argentinian architect Alberto Lievore developed the chair for the Rothko Bar in Barcelona, named after the American abstract expressionist painter Mark Rothko (1903-1970), and the chair's colour also evokes Rothko's work. Lievore's original design updated a conventional bentwood cafe chair to be made in plywood, but over time it developed into this one-piece chair.  In fact the Rothko chair is formed of two pieces of moulded Mader\u00f3n: the front legs and seat are one piece and the back legs and seat back are made as another piece. They are joined together under the seat.",
