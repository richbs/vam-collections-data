            "historical_context_note": "Rackham states that this 'pilgrim bottle is of uncertain origin' and dates it to 1500-20.\nA similar costrel (tav.XV) is illustrated in Reggi, Emilia-Romagna (see References) but is taller, less broad and with floral decoration that fits the shape better than in this one.\nAnother (cat.249) is broad like the V&A one but is taller. This is attributed to possibly western Emilia-Romagna and the second half of the 16th century.\nAnother costrel (cat.274) which is more like (tav.XV in form) is described as western Emilia-Romagna, beginning of the 17th century.\nAnother one (cat.281) has the exact form and decoration as the V&A one but is missing its neck. This is described as western Emilia-Romagna, beginning of the 17th century.\nIn the Po book (see References), cat. 434, there is a similar flask in Mantova which is attributed to 'basso-lombardo o emiliana' and dated 16th to 17th century.\nAlso, in the same book there is (cat.429) a flask of similar shape and decoration to the V&A one which is in a private collection in Mantova and is also described as 'basso-lombardo o emiliana' but dated to the middle or second half of the 16th century.",
