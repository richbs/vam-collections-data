From 1947 to the closure of the business in 1993 they made thousands of different characters and ranges of puppets for children including hand and marionette varieties. Pelham puppets used simple construction methods, materials and influences that reflected the decades in which they were made. New Pelham puppets are now being manufactured again by David Leech in Devon.\n \nPelham puppets often took influence from popular fairy tales or television characters for their puppets. Perky the Pig is a toy version of one half of famous duo, Pinky and Perky. The two original puppet pigs had their own hugely popular television show from the late 1950s and are still a popular icon from the days of early children's television.",
