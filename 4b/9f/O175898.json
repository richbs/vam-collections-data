The composition, with Hercules and the lion in front of classical buildings, is similar to Moderno, but the handling and style vary.\n\nIt depicts Hercules strangling the Nemean lion. Hercules (Greek name is Heracles) is one of the most important heroes in Greek mythology. He was the son of Jupiter and Alcmena, a Theban princess. He is regarded as the embodiment of physical strength and courage. His two main attributes are the club and the lion's skin,which he won at his first labour. He had to undertake 12 labours as a penance for slaying his own children in an act of madness.\n\nModerno is the pseudonym of a goldsmith and medallist active in North Italy and later in Rome. He signed certain pieces of his work with OPUS MODERNI (opus is the Latin term for 'work' - which then means 'work of the modern'). The modern here is referring to the Ancient World, in contrary to the Naturalism of the Gothic. He was active in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. His earliest works may date around 1485-1490, and his earliest dated work is 1490. There are many different suggestions in literature to whom OPUS MODERNI may refer, and there has never been a clear answer to it.",
