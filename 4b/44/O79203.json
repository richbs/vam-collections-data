Each part consists of a stiff strip of silver, bent into a semi-circle, with a band of filigree domes running along its outer side.  There are smaller filigree domes attached between them, above the surface of the band.  On each part, one of the smaller filigree domes is loose, and held in place by a rod which pierces the base and is fastened on the inside by a rivet.  The band is bordered on all sides by a strip of beaded and twisted wires.  The two parts are the same size, and are hinged together at one end, with tubes made of coiled wire.  At the other end there is a similar pin fastening, with a filigree rosette over the join.  The pin is missing.",
