The curator, Shaun Cole, collected more than 100 posters from around the world for the display. This poster was given by the STD/AIDS Control Programme at the Ministry of Health in Entebbe, Uganda. \n\nUganda has been hard hit by HIV/AIDS. The first case was identified in 1982 and the epidemic spread quickly to all parts of the country. By the end of 1992 the national prevalence rate was estimated at 18.3% with some areas registering rates above 30%. A strong response from governmental, health and community organisations emphasising prevention led to declining rates from the mid-1990s. However, AIDS remains the leading cause of death amongst adults in the country.",
