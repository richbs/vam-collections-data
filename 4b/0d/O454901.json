The two armed standing goddess holds a lotus in her right hand, so she would have stood to the left of a male deity.  If the deity was Shiva this would be Parvati; if it was Vishnu this would be Bhu.  She stands on a lotus resting on a ledge.  The rest of the plaque is plain, with an arched top.  There are attachment holes on the sides.  Bright brass front, dark back/interior; little wear.",
