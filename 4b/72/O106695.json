This is the case of this bronze inkstand group, which was intended for the writing table, together with other utensils and vessels. The furnishing of the study was indeed one of the most important tasks of bronze casting. \nThe bull is reclining on the ground, Europa seated on his back and resting her left hand on his horn. At the corner of the base is a large spiral shell for ink. The base is supported on four feet and decorated with a broad band of interlacing ornament.  It might not have been the original one, as the group does not sit correctly on it.\n\nEuropa was a Phoenician woman and in Greek mythology Zeus was falling in love with her and tried to seduce or ravish her. He transformed himself into a white bull, mixing into a larger herd. When Europa saw him she got on his back and Zeus ran away with her to the sea and swam to Crete with her on the back. He then unveiled his identity and Europa became the first Queen of Crete.",
