His work is a perfect reflection of consumer society since the mid-1950s. His images incorporate popular and desirable commodities from the worlds of fashion, mass media and  technology. He has made many screenprints, in which his collages of material from sources as diverse as Playboy magazine and photographs of Greek statues are fused to make astute, and often witty, comments on contemporary society.",

Infected with Prater's enthusiasm for the screenprint medium, House began to experiment in a somewhat unusual way with posters he was making for the Arts Council.  This attracted the attention of the photographer Nigel Henderson, and then that of Eduardo Paolozzi and Richard Hamilton.  Following House's lead, Hamilton himself began to make screenprints with Prater: <i>Adonis</i> was the very first of these.  Subsequently, Hamilton persuaded the ICA (Institute of Contemporary Arts) to commission twenty-four young artists to make screenprints with Prater; the results were exhibited in 1964 and demonstrated the medium's potential for a new generation of artist-printmakers. \n<i>Adonis</i>, first conceived by Hamilton in a series of paintings, was created from an amalgam of mass-media images: a photograph from <i>Life</i> magazine of the Hermes of Praxiteles, a <i>Playboy</i> illustration of a male model and references to brand names and pop music (the title of the work plays on that of the pop song <i>Venus in Blue Jeans</i>).  The conspicuously 'photographic' surface of the male torso, with its well-endowed physique, draws attention to mass-produced popular imagery.  The 'painterly' attributes of other parts of the image, however, also suggests that the 'popular' is as valid a subject for aesthetic investigation as more established pictorial imagery.  Already loaded with metaphor and irony relating to issues of mass production, cultural expectations and originality, the image prompts further questions about how we view art, when the 'unique' painting is translated back into the mass-produced' print. \nFor most of the twentieth century screenprint had been used primarily as a commercial medium, even though artist began using it in the 1930s.  In the UK Francis Carr was experimenting with it in the 1940s; in the 1950s Richard Gear and Peter Lanyon were notable early exponents, while John Coplans was persuading other artist to try it.  Hamilton, Paolozzi and Kitaj, however, are the artists most associated with its rise to a position of unprecedented significance as an artist's medium.  This development is the 1960s and 1970s was immeasurably furthered by Hamilton's formidable grasp of the implications of contemporary printing technology for a relevant contemporary aesthetic.\"",
