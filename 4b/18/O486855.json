The item is made up of four vertical panels joined together and two panels (one square, one semi-circular) of <i>kesi</i> applied to the centre. The whole is lined with pinkish-red cotton.\n\nHigh on the centre panels are two phoenixes, below them are two confronted five-clawed dragons in gold, each pursuing the sacred pearl. These panels have a red background with cloud bands and bats. At the foot of the panels are wave bands and mountains, with Taoist symbols appearing in the waves. The usual strip below the waves showing deep water is missing. On the sides of these panels are phoenixes, bats, dragons pursuing sacred pearls and a continuation of the wave motif.\n\nThe two panels of <i>kesi</i> have different designs. The square panel shows a front facing five-clawed dragon, sacred pearl and cloud bands on a gold ground. There are waves at the foot of this panel and rocks at the sides. The semi-circular panel shows carp leaping through the 'dragon gate' on a gold ground.",
