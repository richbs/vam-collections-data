            "public_access_description": "This cabinet was one of the pieces of furniture exhibited by Louis Majorelle at the Paris International Exhibition in 1900. It helped to establish his reputation as the leading designer and maker of furniture in the fashionable Art Nouveau style, which looked to nature rather than to historical styles for inspiration. \n\nThe cabinet is not directly based on any historical precedent. Its decoration with a tree motif, curving mounts representing plants and horizontal bands of veneer shows Majorelle's skill in creating furniture in the new style.",

ISBN 1851773088.\nThis cabinet was given to the Museum as part of a large and controversial gift from George Donaldson of objects purchased from the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris. Donaldson (1845-1925), a Bond Street dealer whose clients included George Salting, was well known among connoisseurs of the decorative arts at the turn of the century and was a prolific collector in his own right, in particular of musical instruments. As vice-president of the Jury of Awards for furniture at both the 1889 and 1900 Paris Expositions, he was one of a group asked to purchase works of decorative art for the Museum. Donaldson was so impressed by the \"superior ingenuity and taste\" evident in the Art Nouveau objects at the 1900 show, which he considered far better than British products on display, that he felt that the Museum's \u00a3500 purchase allocation was insufficient. Consequently, he offered to donate whatever funds were necessary \"to secure an adequate representation of the objects illustrating the 'New Movement.'\" The objects he acquired included furniture by Gall\u00e9 Majorelle, Spindler, and other lesser-known Hungarian, Norwegian, and German designers, as well as metalwork, pottery, glass, and textiles.\nEarlier a cabinetmaker in the Rococo Revival style, by the 1890s Louis Majorelle - increasingly under the influence of his friend and fellow artist Emile Gall\u00e9 (cats. 166-167) - had become one of the foremost exponents of the naturalistic Art Nouveau style. He adopted the theme of the water lily (or lotus) for the room he designed for the 1900 Paris exhibition. The wrought-iron mounts of this cabinet - whose elegant lines and abstract forms are typical of Majorelle's best work - delineate lotus blossoms in the stylized geometry of Egyptian forms. The cabinet's upper panel constructs in delicate marquetry a horrific scene of a great winged eagle fiercely defending her nest and its three eaglets (just visible to the right of her upraised left wing) against a large predatory snake.\nDonaldson was convinced of the importance of the Art Nouveau objects he generously acquired for the Museum, but he suspected that others might not agree. In fact, the reaction in Britain and, significantly, at the V&A was astonishingly hostile.\n\nLit.
