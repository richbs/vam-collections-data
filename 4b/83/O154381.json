Ros Conway, like Malcolm Appleby, has chosen the heart shape form of trowel for her server, but for Conway, colour is the driving force behind her design.  The shape of the tiger prawns fits perfectly in the two lobes of the blade, their shimmering colour creating an almost trompe l'oeil effect.  The shell topped handle recalls the elaborate and elegant cast ladle handles of the eighteenth century.  While enamelling is some two thousand years old, invented as a substitute for precious stones, Conway's pieces are strikingly contemporary, and exploit the potential of enamelling to the point of it being an art in its own right, yet literally and metaphorically welded to the object.  This is not a limitation but rather an integral motivation and inspiration for her work.",
