The back of this card was inscribed in pencil \"London Archives of the Dance\".  The card was removed during Conservation and not retained.\nThe design was originally part of the London Archives of the Dance; the Archives never achieved an independent home and part of the collection was  stored with Cyril Beaumont, where it became inextricably mixed with his own collection and came to the Museum as part of the Cyril Beaumont Bequest.\n\nHistorical significance: An example of 19th century stage costume in the realistic tradition, but executed imaginatively by the leading dance and musical theatre designer of the period.",
