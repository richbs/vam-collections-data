The Totum must be figures 1 to 8 on its several faces, in pen and ink.  The pyramids are supposed to be the travellers who make the tour; each pyramid having 4 counters of the same colour belong to it, which are called markers or servants:  when you find that these are complete, you may begin the game agreeable to the following rules.\n\n1.  Each player must hold a pyramid or traveller, and four counters of the same colour.\n2.  In order to know who bigins the game, each player must spin the Totum, and the highest number takes the lead, then the next highest, etc.\n3.  The first player then spins, and if he turns up No. 4, he is to place his pyramid on Hanover, and stay there till it is his turn to spin again.\n 4.  If in the second spinning he turns up No. 3, he is to add that to 4, his former number, and place his pyramid on No. 7 (Carlesroma) and in this manner the game ust be continued till the traveller reaches No. 102, which is London, the first city in Europe;  when he wins the game.\n5.  If the last spin does not exactly make up to the No.102, but goes beyond it, he must then go back as many numbers as he exceeds it, an try his fortune again, till one of the players spins the lucky number.\n6.  When a player is obliged to wait one or more turns, he must deposit as many counters as he is directed to wait turns (which never exceed four) and when it is his turn to spin again, instead of spinning, he must take up a counter, and so on till they are all taken up.\n7.  Whenever he turns up a number which belongs to one of the following cities he has the privilege of reckoning his last spin twice over; they being the capitals of the several kingdoms and states of Europe.\nCopenhagen, the capital of Denmark; Stockholm...Sweden; Petersburgh...Russia; Warsaw...Poland; Berlin...Prussia; Vienna...Germany; Constantinople...Turkish Empire; Turin...Sardinia; Naples...Kingdom of Naples; Madrid...Spain; Lisbon...\nPortugal; Paris...France; Dublin...Ireland; Edinburgh...Scotland; Amsterdam...\nHolland.\n\n*The game shows 102 towns, some of which were capitals of `kingdoms and states' of Europe, and landing on one of these brings the priviledge of doubling the last spin..  Most of the descriptions stress what might be seen in each town, and some reflect military activities such as battles, arsenals and fortifications.  Both the TOUR OF EUROPE and TOUR OF ENGLAND AND WALES give an insight into what was currently regarded as historically and commercially important.  Of course, these games were published at the height of the Grand Tour of Europe, and all that was thought to be best was included.\n\nRules placement: printed separately and placed either side of the playing sheet",
