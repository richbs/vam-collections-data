She wrote the  majority of the twenty-three Original Peter Rabbit Books  between 1901 and 1913. The Tale of Peter Rabbit  (Frederick Warne, 1902) is her most famous and best- loved tale.\n\nAn artist himself, Rupert Potter (1832-1914) was  probably the single greatest influence on his daughter's  enduring passion for the arts and natural history and on her development as a writer and illustrator. Rupert took up photography in the 1860s when it was still a relatively new art form and was elected to the Photographic Society of London in 1869. An enthusiastic and skilled amateur, he later contributed to photographic  exhibitions.  Rupert's favourite subject was Beatrix herself.  Photography was an expensive and laborious  process yet she appears to have endured patiently the  elaborate choreography and the camera\u2019s uncomfortably long exposure. Rupert's prolific legacy of  several hundred photographs forms a broad pictorial  account of Beatrix\u2019s life from infancy to marriage.\n\nBeatrix's grandparents lived at Camfield Place in Essendon.  Some of Beatrix's happiest childhood moments were spent there - the 'place I love best in the world' - and the backgrounds to The Tale of Peter Rabbit were inspired by the Camfield estate.  During the summer months the Potter family enjoyed extended summer holidays in Scotland and the Lake District, but they also spent many summers in Hertfordshire and rented houses near Camfield Place, including Bush Hall and Bedwell Lodge.  This photograph of Rupert, Beatrix and Bertram Potter with their dog,  Spot, was taken on 11 October 1883 while the family were renting Woodfield.",
