They are traditionally rectangular, round, tulip- or comma-shaped.\n\nThis clasp was described as traditional Greek when it was acquired by the Museum in 1872, but this seems unlikely.  Although Greek clasps are often circular in design, and decorated with repousse patterns, like this, they are never completely round.  They always have an extension on the outside edge, sometimes no more than a slight protrusion, but always present.  If this clasp is Greek, it is not a traditional design.\n\nIt was bought for ten shillings at the International Exhibition, London, 1872.",
