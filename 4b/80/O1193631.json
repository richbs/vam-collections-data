The house front opens through a small brass clasp hook on the proper left of the house and by way of two hinges on the right, revealing two rooms inside, one upstairs and one on ground level. Externally the house has a blue roof with a removable turret section. When removed this reveals the inside of the roof cavity. On the front of the house there are three windows and a door with a blue overhang porch and a small balcony with a wooden fretwork balustrade. The base of the house has been painted with a stippled effect in grey and green. The overall colour scheme of the outside of the house is cream with peach, yellow and light blue details, suggesting brickwork, curtains and shutters. Inside the house the upper room has a wood finish floor and a straw coloured geometric design wallpaper on the walls. The lower ground floor room has a blue and cream tile effect floor in printed paper with a brown and orange paper print on the walls.",

It is an example of one of the blue roof series, produced from about 1880-1910. From 1910 the company more commonly made houses with red roofs..\nBlue roof houses were some of the company's earliest products and were mass produced for an international market. The blue houses, like this one, were often made with a simple wooden construction. The detail for the house was achieved through lithographic printed paper stuck to the surface of the wood. This produced a cost effective but attractive and detailed product.\nGottschalk along with other companies O the same period such as G & J Lines in the UK and the Bliss company in the USA, all contributed to the rise in mass manufacture of dolls' houses which, due to their smaller size, made them more affordable and practical for a wider number of children around the turn of the century.",
