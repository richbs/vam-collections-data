There are tapes from the side seams. Hand stitched.\n\nThe skirt is flat pleated from panels at the centre front and back. There is a hook and eye fastening at the centre right front and watch pocket. The skirt is lined with glazed cotton and the hem is faced with green brush braid.\n\nThe belt has a diamond shaped panel centre front and back. At the front this is trimmed with four glass buttons and at the back with a button and pink stitched bow with streamers.
