This style, based on designs of the 1500s and 1600s,  was fashionable for interiors and for furniture in Britain in the 1830s and 1840s. The table comes from Corsham Court, Wiltshire, a house originally built in 1582. In 1844-9 Lord Methuen, the owner, commissioned the architect Thomas Bellamy to rebuild the central block of the house with several Elizabethan Revival rooms, including a dining room and billiard room on the ground floor. The design and scale of the table suggest that it may have been made for a sitting room or bedroom on the floor above. Underneath the top it is labelled by the firm of Blake & Co. of Mount Street, London, cabinet-makers who specialised in floral marquetry.",
