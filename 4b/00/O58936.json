However, its maker, Antonio Petroni (active 1860-1870) of Rome, described himself on the label inside as a prize-winner (premiato) at the Universal Exhibition of Paris in 1867, although in fact he received an Honourable Mention for his string instruments. This instrument was said to have been made for Queen Margherita of Italy (1851-1926) but its case bears an incorrect version of the Italian royal coat of arms - the heraldic cross is like a Swiss cross, when in fact it should span the whole shield. This example is a 'Neapolitan' mandolin, the 'Milanese' version having died out by the 1860s. It is fitted with metal strings, tuned like a violin and played with a pick.",
