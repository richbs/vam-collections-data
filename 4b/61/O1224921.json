His series The Brave Onesshows ceremonially dressed Zulu boys and men from the Shembe religious community. The costume they wear is usually reserved for ritual dancing and worship at annual festivals. Here, however, Mthethwa isolates his subjects from the context of the festival and poses them against the Arcadian landscape of Kwa Zulu Natal. The mixed visual code of Shembe ceremonial dress (shirts and ties, football socks, and skirts worn as kilts) combines references to Scottish Highlanders, once stationed in the region, with traditional African costume, while blurring the boundaries between masculine and feminine fashion. For Mthethwa: 'by separating my subjects from the ritual and anchoring them in that landscape I am telling you a story. Photography for me is all about editing. When you edit you retell stories and create new stories.\u2019",
