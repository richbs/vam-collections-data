The bag is squareish in shape from the front and the sides and volume for the contents of the bag are constructed using a simple purse-like v-shape with two triangular shaped insets providing  the shape for the bag's interior volume. When the bag is shut, these tabs fold inwards to create the flatish square shape to the bag.The  bag has an integral chrome handle the top. with a thin layer of leather surrounding it. The bag has applied cream leather flowers on the front, forming a decorative ring of small flowers around a larger deep set cluster and two smaller ones in the centre of the design. There are also  decorative thick cream leather diagonal stitches up the sides of the  bag and over the leather clasp, which  closes the bag over the lower part of the chrome handle, by the use of a press stud on a leather tab, also decorated by two small cream flowers. The bag has a white kid lining with a small open pocket for a mirror. The bag opens at the top, top a maximum of  11cms in depth.",

This is a rare opportunity to follow the changing size, fashions and clothing choices (either her own or those chosen for her) of one individual throughout their childhood of the mid 1950s-1960s including those clothes worn for every day as well as those saved for best.",
