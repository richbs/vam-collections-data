This brilliant glaze was known as flamb\u00e9 in Europe and yaobian (kiln transmutation) in Chinese. During the early Qing period a growing appreciation for early Jun wares led to commissions copying the archaic vessel. After an official request for pieces from the Yongzheng emperor, in the seventh year of his reign (1729), Jingdezhen potters were asked to improve the colour of the old glazes. Under the supervision of Nian Xiyao and Tang Ying, kiln superintendents, a series of experiments were undertaken. The final result was a combination of three colours: red and blue for the body, and brown for the base. Over a white porcelain body these glazes created a rich colour and brilliant shine. \n\nDuring the late nineteenth century European potters attempted to reproduce the striking colours of the popular monochrome pieces of the Qing dynasty and their older predecessors.",
