There have been four theatres on the Drury Lane site. The first, which opened in 1663, burned down in 1672. Its replacement opened in 1674 and was in use until 1791 when the manager, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, had it demolished and replaced by a grander building designed by Henry Holland. Holland's theatre was short lived: it was destroyed by fire in 1809. The fourth theatre, which is the one standing today, was designed by Benjamin Wyatt and opened in 1812. The exterior view shown in the etching is of the fourth theatre, viewed from the junction of Great Russell Street and Brydges Street (now Russell Street and Catherine Street). The interior view is dated to 1792 and shows the second theatre, although this building was then in the process of demolition.",
