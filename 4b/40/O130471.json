The knees at the top of the mahogany legs are carved with a pattern associated with Giles Grendey (found on some chairs that bear his label). The veneered oak folding rails are each held rigid in the folded-out position by a hook and ring -- the ring fixed to one half of the rail, the long hook fixed to the other half and folded across the joint to engage in the ring. One of the hooks is missing, the other has a black lacquered surface, probably indicating that it is not very old (and was lacquered to give it artificial patination). The steel hinges securing the folding rails to the long 'back' rail are also modern (and not disguised).\n\nWhile the rails are of mahogany-veneered oak, the top, which is much more conspicuous, is of solid mahogany, so this may be a replacement.",
