Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nThe Cole Porter musical Kiss Me Kate opened at the Coliseum Theatre in March 1951, and after a successful London run embarked on a provincial tour which visited Oxford in August 1952. Kiss Me Kate was filmed by MGM in 1953.",

            "history_note": "The artist of these caricatures, Gilbert Sommerlad, was by profession a musician who was born into a family that had a long tradition of professional musicians.    In 1936 he moved to the recently built New Theatre, Oxford, to join his brother Roy (violin and clarinet) as resident pianist.\n\nGilbert was an exceptionally good and popular rehearsal pianist, and visiting companies and individual performers used to make sure that he would be available.  He became well-known in the profession and his ability as a caricaturist became common knowledge.  The volume that includes this drawing contains sketches mostly of musical directors and conductors working at the Oxford New Theatre with Gilbert Sommerlad.",
