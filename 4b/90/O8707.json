The wife's panel includes her coat of arms, which show that she was related to the Louvain families of Pinnock and Absoloens. Both these families had contributed financially to the Charterhouse in Louvain.\n\nThe Charterhouse in Louvain, a monastery of the Carthusian Order, was founded at the end of the 15th century by the Dukes of Burgundy. Records indicate that the glazing in the church and cloister was carried out from about 1500 by Hendrik van Diependale of Louvain. He died in 1509 and his son Jan carried on the work. \n\nA 19th-century drawing of the cloister windows indicates that there were 80 windows of two lights each, surmounted by a single quatrefoil-shaped panel. Each window seems to have been composed of prophet panels surmounting narrative ones. \n\nThe theme of the cloister glazing centred on the Fall and Redemption of humankind through the life and death of Christ. New Testament scenes would have been paired with the Old Testament ones that prefigured them. Prophets announcing these events would have been included in the upper portions of the windows.\n\nPanels depicting saints and donors would have accompanied these scenes, probably in the lowest registers of the windows. The donor depicted in this panel kneels before a statue of St Mary Magdalene, who was the patron saint of the monastery.",
