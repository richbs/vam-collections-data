The picture is framed with an inner border on the plain ivory ground of the album page.  It is made with strips of faded red paper cut out on both sides round the outermost edge of the mauve flower and one of the leaves of the pink flowered plant on the right.  The frame has a gold outer line and ruled lines in black.  The page has strips of  buff-coloured paper at its edges outlined in black on its inner sides.  There is a strip of beige woven textile added over the remains of  the inner margin as a gutter for the album binding.",

It contains 56 leaves on which are Mughal miniature paintings, drawing and flower studies on both sides. The binding is covered with an Indian brocade silk that may have been cut from lengths brought home by the 2nd Lord Clive, who served as Governor of Madras, 1799 to 1803.  The album was sold from Powis Castle at Sotheby's sale, 16 to 18 January 1956, lot 332A.",
