            "public_access_description": "This set of eight plates was designed by Alfred Beau and was made in partnership with Augustine Carof at the Porquier factory, Quimper, during the 1880s. Beau, the Curator at the Quimper Museum and an artist and photographer, became involved in the Porquier faience factory in 1872 and left it in 1890. During the intervening years the factory made a range of distinctive patterns based on his drawings of Breton subjects and indigenous Breton plants and wildlife, all finely painted in soft colours on a blue-grey tinted ground. \n\nThis set is from the factory\u2019s \u2018Botanique\u2019 range of 122 designs of plants (with fish, rodent and insects), apparently the first wares Alfred Beau designed for the works. Beau\u2019s designs for the factory were much admired, an example depicting Breton beggars winning him a medal at the Paris Exposition in 1878, and were copied by other manufacturers (these pieces, however, bear the correct mark of the Porquier-Beau partnership, a horizontal B intersected by a vertical P). The asymmetrical treatment and close-cropping of the plants in some of Beau\u2019s botanical designs may have been suggested by Japanese prints.\n\nIn La Faience de Quimper (1979) Marjatta Taburet gives some details of workshop practice at the factory at the time when these plates were made. Alfred Beau made drawings of Breton subjects, working first in pencil and then in watercolour. The outlines were then traced onto thin paper, and these were pricked for pouncing the design onto the ware (examples of these pricked drawings survive in the Archives of the Fa\u00efenceries de Quimper). Some of the figurative designs were made by combining elements from two or more of these tracings, and this may also have been true of the \u2018Botanique\u2019 range. The decoration was carried out by a team of eighteen young women who had been personally selected by Beau. Four women worked on each plate: one transferred the design; the colour washes were divided between another two women; and a fourth decorator, the \u2018finisseuse\u2019 painted the outlines and did any retouching necessary.",
