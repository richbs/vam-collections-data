It was recorded as having  been 'found at Agra', and described as \"Ancient Hindu\". It is more likely to have been made for  'Jahangir's Quadrangle' (Daulat khan-i jahangiri) in Lahore Fort, which was started by Akbar but completed during Jahangir's reign. This bracket formed part of the frontage of carved columns and animal brackets, and reflects the same heritage of Hindu palace architecture as is found in the early buildings of Agra and Fatehpur Sikri'. It probably dates to about 1617 or 1618.",
