            "public_access_description": "A writing box such as this would have been fitted with various implements utilised for writing from an ink stick, water dropper, ink stone and brushes. To prepare the ink some water would have been applied to the well at the end of ink stone by the water dropper. The ink stick would then be carefully dipped in the water and then slowly but firmly ground against the rough edge of the ink stone. Seen as a careful and meditative process, ink preparation took time and was finished only when the consistency of the ink reached the desired thickness. This left ample time for the individual to admire the box. \nThe application of brown lacquer on this piece gives the appearance of a burnished bronze gong while the interior of the lid holds a realistic depiction of a small spider. Together the exterior and interior of the lid are based on the close observation of the original object and are replicated in lacquer to stunning and innovative effect.   \nFrom the 18th century onwards, many more makers signed their work. This example is signed Ogawa Haritsu. The artist Ogawa Haritsu (1663-1747) was a devout Buddhist, great poet and famous artist. Born into a samurai family based in Kyoto Haritsu would study Kano School painting, literature and the tea ceremony. He was also a trained potter and would use pottery inlays, as seen on this box, within his works. His lacquer work was innovative in style and would combine numerous techniques and materials to mimic the textures and colours of objects, animals or, as exemplified on this item, fish.",
