It show St Bartholomew, St Paul and the incomplete figure of a third apostle standing within a Romanesque arcade bearing their names and topped with small turreted buildings. Other fragments from the original hanging or altar dossal are in the collection of the Mus\u00e9e National du Moyen Age in Paris and the \u00d6sterreichisches Museum f\u00fcr angewandte Kunst in Vienna. There are two further but smaller fragments in the V&A collection that may also be from the same hanging. \n\nThe original composition of the panel may have been similar to that of a complete German painted altar dossal of about 1170-80, in which the figure of Christ in Majesty is flanked by two male and two female saints within Romanesque arches topped by buildings.",
