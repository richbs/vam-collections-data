The centre panel, the hem and the bottom of the sleeves are embroidered with a scrolling floral pattern in a gold thread wound on a silk core, with some red and green chenille thread and seed pearls. The hem and sleeves are scalloped at the edges and finished with gold thread and seed pearls. The neck and both sides of the front slits are finished with needle-woven braid in gold thread and black silk and trimmed with gold needle lace. The inside of the neck, the centre panel and the edges of the front openings are faced with a darker blue silk.\n\nThe skirt is made of woven silk embroidered with metal thread, lined with cotton. Coral coloured silk woven with a white spot. Lined with unbleached cotton. It is a very full skirt made from ten loom widths of fabric gathered by a drawstring at the waist.
