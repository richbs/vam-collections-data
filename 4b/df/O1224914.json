Long sleeves with a godet inset at the wrist, the draped front of the blouse fastening just below the bust with hooks and eyes. The armholes are cut with a band of inset black organza around each armhole separating the printed white sleeves from the printed white body, and additional detail is provided by deep epaulette flaps of clear vinyl faced with white organza and stiffened, interlined sculptural squares of organza at each armhole which extend into a connected half-belt round the back, cut with two deep triangular notches. The back of the blouse is extended into a shaped tail which drapes over the bustle of the skirt/underdress.\n[skirt] Black silk dress or skirt with a pronounced weave, woven in gold lurex thread with an elaborate custom-designed pattern. Although described as a skirt, the dress is shaped and cut around the waistband in the manner of a bustier. Despite this, there is little interior shaping. The skirt of the dress is cut in three layers in the front in the manner of a beetle carapace, with the bottom-most layer slightly slit in the centre hem, then the middle layer cut higher, with a deep notch suggesting folded beetle wings. The outermost layer is cut in two symmetrical parts with the fabric cut in deep loops mid-way down. The back of the skirt has a hidden zipper and is loosely draped over the fitted lining in the style of an 1880 bustle. The garment is lined throughout in black silk satin.",
