In such drawings he was freed from  \nthe discipline of working within practical and  \nmaterial limits, and was able to give full rein to \nhis imagination, drawing upon his consider- \nable skills as a draughtsman: these he had \npartly acquired during several years\u2019 employ- \nment in the office of John Soane, producing \nlavish water-colour perspectives after his \nemployer\u2019s designs.\u2019",
