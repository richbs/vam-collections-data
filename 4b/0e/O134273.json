As she describes it: 'The 200th anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar is celebrated at Portsmouth with a Review of the Fleet, and ends with a dramatic firework display, capturing the public imagination.'\n\n'Marf' drew daily topical cartoons for the Evening Standard between March 2002 and August 2005, moving to the Londoner's Diary page in August 2003. The drawings cover key political and social issues of the period, providing a vivid and often hilarious response to the main news of the day. The Evening Standard is London's only evening newspaper, publishing up to five editions a day. In Marf's own words: 'The cartoonist needs to keep up with the rapid pace of event.'",
