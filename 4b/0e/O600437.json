Time, Death and Judgement exemplifies Watts's commitment to the portrayal of eternal subjects and abstract spiritual themes through figurative allegories or 'similies'. The male youth on the left strides forward with monumental strength and indifference, to illustrate the relentless march of time. Time holds hands with the female figure of Death, who in the finished oil paintings can be better seen gazing down at freshly cut flowers, leaves and blossoms. Judgement can be identified by both her set of scales and the blindfold she wears to symbolise impartiality.",
