Mercury, also clad in armour, stands next to him. He holds an Apple of Discord in his right hand and seems to address the semi-nude goddess Juno, Minerva and Venus. Venus with flowing hair stands frontally next to Paris, while Juno, depicted from the back, holds a goblet in her left hand. She wears a Venetian hairnet-cap, a chain of pearls around her neck, and a larger chain around her shoulders. Minerva is depicted from the side holding a standard.

This was later widely disseminated in printed books throughout Europe. The Dream of Paris was widely represented in art in the first half of the 16th century.\n\nThe present relief, probably made for a collector, is attributed to the workshop of the anonymous carver who signed some exquisite pearwood small-scale reliefs with the letters I.P. The monogram AD for Albrecht D\u00fcrer inscribed on the slab may have been added (almost certainly at a later date) because of its virtuoso technique, perhaps when it entered a cabinet of curiosities. \n\nThe rich forest landscape is related to the contemporary painting of the Danube school. The composition is so arranged that the female nude is seen from three positions. Such a relief would have been produced as a virtuoso example of wood carving and included along with medals and other small sculpture in a Kunstkammer or cabinet of curiosities.",
