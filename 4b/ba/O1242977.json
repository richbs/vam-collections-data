            "public_access_description": "This hooded chair was almost certainly made in Kirkwall by David Kirkness. The hooded chair was the most expensive of Kirkness's four chair types. The box beneath the seat, sometimes with a plain panel instead of a drawer, was seen in many Orkney chairs in the nineteenth century, but the hooded top was more unusual. \n\nOriginally designed to offer warmth, the hooded chair appealed to turn-of-the-century romanticism about the Scottish Islands as much as practical utility. This chair was one of a pair that belonged to the Welsh painter Augustus John (1878-1961). When acquired by the museum its drawer contained Volume II of Songs of the Hebrides, a song book published in 1917, further emphasising the chair's romantic associations.",
