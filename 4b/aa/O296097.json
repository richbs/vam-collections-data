Most had a loop on the back for attachment, but in Norway and Sweden stud buttons were also used.  These were mainly worn by men, at the throat, to keep their shirts closed.  They were often decorated with filigree.  \n\nThe pattern on this stud button, of rings of coil rings and bands of wrapped wire surrounding a central knop, is very common on buttons of the late 18th and early 19th century.  It was used in Norway and northern Germany as well as Sweden.  Swedish silversmiths often replaced the central piece of silver with a coloured glass paste during the 19th century.  The marks on the back are illegible, but it is typical of the kind of traditional jewellery worn in Sk\u00e5ne in the first half of the 19th century.  Sk\u00e5ne province has the richest tradition of jewellery, and more was worn there than in any other district.  Almost all the Swedish traditional jewellery at the V&A comes from Sk\u00e5ne.",
