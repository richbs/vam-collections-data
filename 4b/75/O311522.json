Mauch was born c. 1477 in Ulm, he died 1540 in Liege. He was a specialist in altarpieces. In 1529 he was granted permission by the city council to leave Ulm for five years. He left the city just before the establishment of Lutheranism in 1531, apparently because  there were likely to be no further commissions for religious sculpture, and moved to Liege.",
