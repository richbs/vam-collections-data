The cones and the filling of the stripes are made up of small splodges of colour, suggesting small flowers, stems and veins of red in cones and meanders of red in the stripes. Woven with a woollen weft and a silk warp. Woven in 2/1 twill. The top and lower edges are hemmed. The sides have a two cord selvedge, and the warp threads are doubled for the 0.375 inch before it. Into all four sides is knotted a sparse fringe of tightly twisted cream wool.",

This example with a silk warp and woollen weft was a lightweight shawl for summer.  \n\nOnly the blue dye and the blue component of the green dye have taken on the silk warp - this has left minute areas of the white warp visible and so creates the appearance of a woven pattern by avoiding the solid blocks of colour usually associated with printed fabrics.  The restricted colour range is typical of that popular in the late 1820s and again in the early 1840s.",
