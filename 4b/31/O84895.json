This was either during the week of 2 January 1905 or 16 April 1906. It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre. He compiled them in a series of albums.\n\nThe contortionist Juno Salmo was known as the homme grenouille or \u2018frog-man\u2019 when he performed in Paris with the Nouveau Cirque in a frog costume. He would dislocate his shoulders and hop around the aquatic part of the ring and do acrobatic contortions on a trapeze that appeared to be made of bamboo. He is seen here doing a similar act, but balancing on a pole dressed as a yellow devil. In his inscription on another of Cooke's caricatures of him in this collection, he describes himself as the \u2018Mephisto Moderne\u2019. The diabolic theme appears to have been a feature of his unusual act. The reviewer of his performance at Hanley in 1905 commented on the loud applause he received, \u2018for his very smart work on a very narrow seat at the top of a tall metal post and on a trapeze\u2019. In 1906 the reviewer noted that he performed \u2018some amazing contortions amid remarkable stage effects to sustain the Mephistophelian title to which he assumes\u2019.",

On that visit he dated another caricature that Cooke drew of him (S.393:27-2002). Salmo had also been known as 'l'homme grenouille' or 'the frog man' because of the frog imitation act he had performed in Paris at the Nouveau Cirque. This caricature comes from the second album of caricatures in a collection of albums owned by the Theatre Museum compiled by the graphic artist George Cooke.  It is labelled by the artist 'Geo Cooke HYS BOOKE' and features music hall performers working in the early 20th century.",

This one, although in a later position in the album, has been cut out and stuck in, so its chronology is difficult to determine.",
