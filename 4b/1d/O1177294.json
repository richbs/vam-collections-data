By the time of this tour in 1977, Queen had the third best selling single of all time, with Bohemian Rhapsody, and had had major success in the United States of America. They could easily sell out two nights at Earl's Court and celebrate their success with these giant capacity gigs. Their live show was spectacular, a taste of which can be seen in the photograph used on their promotional poster.",
