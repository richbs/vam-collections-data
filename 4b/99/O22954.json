The arrest of various heroes of the underground subculture, including pop stars, and general harassment of all hippies led to a number of 'legalise pot rallies', to  protest against infringement of individual liberty and the 'war' between generations.\n\nMike McInnerney did a number of posters for the underground. His style is particularly evocative of the hallucinatory effect of drugs with amorphous forms growing out of a swirk of smoke and rainbow colours.\n\n[Julia Bigham, 'British Design at Home', p.148]",
