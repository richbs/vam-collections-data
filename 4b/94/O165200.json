The design entirely derives from simplified geometry and refined engineering.  The chief feature is the steel band that frames the moulded plywood seat and also serves as the footrest.  There is nothing extraneous in the design, and nothing that could be described as decorative. Nevertheless, the economy and restraint of the form give it great elegance. \n\nThe LEM bar stool has been a major commercial and critical success for its Japanese-born, British-resident designers, and the Italian manufacturer, with over 200,000 being made since its launch in 2000. This example is from the first production run and was given to the Museum by one of the designers, together with design drawings charting its development.",

During that period all designs were presented as co-authored. Subsequently the designers re-attributed various designs and determined that the LEM Bar Stool was principally the work of Shin Azumi. Nevertheless, in recognition that it was produced during the period of their partnership, Shin and Tomoko have agreed it should be attributed to 'Shin Azumi with Tomoko Azumi'.  See RF 2008/201 for more information.\n\nLEM stands for Lunar Excursion Module.\n\nAttribution note: This example is from the first production run",
