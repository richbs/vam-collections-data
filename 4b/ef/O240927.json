For two other studies of the same subject see no. 339, recto and verso. See also the note under that entry. It is hard to believe that Tintoretto himself was responsible for all of the numerous sketches after this piece of sculpture which have survived from his studio, and it is reasonable to assume that the less accomplished versions, including our four, were the work of pupils, who were perhaps set this task as part of their training.",
