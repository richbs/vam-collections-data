The impact of westernisation upon Japanese society had caused lacquerware to be considered unfashionable by the general populace. Lacquerers that continued in the industry had to find other creative means to promoting interest in their wares, often by modernising and improving old techniques through a shinier finish or greater range and vibrancy in colour. This piece exemplifies lacquer produced for the Western market due to the poor-quality of the lacquer and its colourful and busy design. \nThe triangular shape of this box was common during the Nara period (710-784) but became more unusual during the Momoyama (1573-1615) and Edo (1615-1868) periods.",
