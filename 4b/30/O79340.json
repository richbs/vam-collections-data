Although individual pieces rarely date back any earlier than the 19th century, the designs are very old, and European observers liked to find traces of Roman or Phoenician influence.\n\nEarrings in the 19th century were particularly large, and are sometimes mistaken for bangles today.  The decorative bead in the centre would have made it very uncomfortable to wear these on the wrist, and the hook fastening is the kind which was always used for earrings, not bangles.\n\nThey were probably made in Egypt.  Egypt was the main production centre for jewellery for use by the nomadic tribes of the region, who obtained all their jewellery from specialist urban silversmiths.",
