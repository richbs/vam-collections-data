E.1451-1962\n\nGustave-Paul Cluseret (1823-c. 1900), a professional soldier, had participated in a number of wars during the 25 years before 1870, without being particularly concerned about whom he sided with. He fought in the Crimea, in Algeria and in the American Civil War. Although he had participated in the suppression of the French Revolution of 1848, the Commune appointed him Commander of the National Guard on 2 April 1871. He did not approve of the sortie scheduled for the following day but true to his lazy nature did nothing to prevent it. His efforts to organize the defence of Paris and re-form the National Guard were sporadic; he made no attempt to hide his contempt for the amateur soldiers. Nevertheless, while the Commune were plotting his downfall, he saved Fort Issay from occupation by the Versaillais with only a handful of men although the Guards on duty had already deserted the post in despair. The fort remained in communard hands for another 9 days. This success was not enough to restore him to the favour of the Commune and on his return to Paris he was dismissed from service.'\n<u>Victoria & Albert Museum Department of Prints and Drawings and Department of Paintings, Accessions 1962</u>.
