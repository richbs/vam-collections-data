The present specimen was written at Burhanpur when the court was there between February 1630 and March 1632, and at the time of writing it Dara Shikoh was in his 16th or 17th year. His father Shah Jahan was also producing calligraphic specimens for a personal muraqqa at the same age. Dara was a pupil of Abdur Rashid Dailami and refers to his own calligraphic contributions to a Karnama or Muraqqa in a preface which has been thought to relate to an album in the India Office Library which he gave to his wife in 1051.",
