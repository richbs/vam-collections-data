A period of living and studying in Japan led Derges to adopt photography as her principal means of expression. Her images are often formed as photograms directly onto positive photographic paper. \n\nThis is a small and delicate photogram of a block of ice. A photogram is a photograph made without a camera or a lens by placing an object or objects on top of a piece of paper or film coated with light-sensitive materials and then exposing the paper or film to light. Where the object covers the paper, the paper remains unexposed and light in tone: where it does not cover, the paper darkens. If the object is translucent, midtones appear. After exposure the paper is developed and fixed.",
