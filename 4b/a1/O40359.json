He is recognised primarily for achievements in imperial and foreign affairs, especially with the 1878 conflict between Russia and Turkey relating the Bulgarians. This lead to the Congress of Berlin summoned by Prince Bismarck, where then a settlement was reached - largely due to Disraeli - to give the Bulgarians a qualified independence.\nWilliam Behnes (1774/5-1864) was the son of a Hanoverian pianoforte maker living in London. Behnes commenced studies at the Royal Academy. He probably began work as an independent sculptor around 1819. He was very successful and well respected for the execution of his busts. Behnes exhibited constantly at the Royal Academy between 1815 and 1863, but died almost destitute, having been declared bankrupt in 1861.",
