By the 1720s, fashion moved on again. Lace was once more worn by all those who could afford it, but a new style of bobbin lace developed, of great delicacy and refinement, incorporating the soft draping qualities of muslin. It was made particularly in the region around Valenciennes, which although French territory, had a tradition of lace making in the Flemish style, using exceptionally fine thread. \n\nBecause of the fineness of its thread, and the density of its patterns, Valenciennes lace was very slow to make. It was made in a single strip (rather than several sections which could be made by different workers and joined up). This border is of exceptional unbroken length (more than 5 metres). Such fine lace has always been highly valued, since the 19th century in the collectors\u2019 market as well as for fashionable wear, and almost all surviving pieces have been cut into fairly short lengths. It would however have been originally made in such long continuous strips, Queen Caroline needing nine yards, for example, for a cap in 1733. That is the approximate date of this piece, which may represent a year\u2019s work for one lace maker.",

He married Alexandra (b. Corfu 4 Feb. 1880; d. Brussels 1961) whose mother was Angelia n\u00e9e Calvocoressi and who chose the family name Comnene, in Brussels in 1913. Alexandra accompanied her husband in his foreign postings to Peking between 1910-16 and again in 1920-24, Berlin 1924-31 and Madrid 1932-29 after which the couple resided in Brussels. Together they formed collections of Mexican armour, Mexican textiles, Puebla ceramics, Spanish colonial glass; Chinese textiles, Chinese and Japanese lacquer, Chinese furniture, ceramics and metalwork; and they preserved inherited period lace.\n\nParts of these collections have been acquired by museums internationally:\nThe British Museum: Mexican textiles and beadwork (1994 AM3.1, AM7.1-20; 1996 AM10 1-18; 1997 AM4.1)\nMexico City, Franz Mayer Museum: Mexican rebosos and textiles (1994 AD-004, AD-020;DRA-0009, DRA-0025; AD-021, AD-030; DCH-0001, DCH-0010; AD-031, AD-038; DFB-007, DFB-0014); Ecclesiastical embroidered panels, XVI century (2002 09157-01966; DCN-0013, FCF-0011-15; FPA-0013-16)\n\nAlexandra Comnene-Everts was herself a proficient artist and designer. Albums of her drawings of ornament on Chinese monuments (c. 1919-25) have been acquired by the British Library (1998 N Or.15493/1-6) and the bridal tiara she commissioned from Cartier in Paris is on loan to the Victoria & Albert Museum.\n\nThe acquisitions from this collection in the Victoria & Albert Museum are:\nAsian, set of 8 kessus (silk tapestry), late Ming period (T.269-G-1971); feather fan, carved jewelled handle, Chinese, c. 1910 (FE-2008)\n\nFashion, 20th century dress (T.12-2003 \u2013 T.17-2003); Textiles, English, French, Belgian and Flemish lace (T.5 to T.10-2003; T.62 to T.65-2008)\n\nRef: Claire Brisby, \u2018Angelia Calvocoressi 1840-1929: A Cosmopolitan Life\u2019, Journal of the Hellenic Diaspora, 30.2 (2004), 97-130.",
