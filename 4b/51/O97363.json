The barrel has an incised signature 'IOS WHETHAM' in eighteenth century hand, possibly that of a former owner. The stock, which has many bore holes from an attack of woodworm, is decorated with acanthus leaves and stylised tulips resembling contemporary English carved furniture. Under the barrel at the balancing point is a carved mask topped by a buffer to position the gun on a wall or butt.",

The stock and lock however were made too late for this and date from 1660-80. The earlier barrel has been converted from a matchlock and may well have survived the wars when Dunster Castle was attacked on 4 occasions. \n\nWall guns are rare from the 17th century. Long muskets were common around the time of the Civil Wars in the 1640s and were balanced on rests which were spiked into the ground. This wall gun is less mobile and was designed to fire from a fixed position either for self defence or for target shooting. Much of the armoury at Dunster Castle was put together by Francis Luttrell in the 1670s and he may have commissioned the alteration of the gun.",
