The handle is effective rather than elegant.\n\nPeople\nWe know nothing about the person for whom the mug was made. But, in view of the fact that England was highly centralised and that London-made delftware was mainly aimed either at a local market or at the colonies in North America, we may assume that the recipient was a Londoner. It is yet another example of the remarkable survival of a treasured family possession - one with no intrinsic value whatever.\n\nDesign & Designing\nOne of the big advantages of tin-glazed earthenware ('delftware') over other forms of pottery, and the main reason for it being used for pharmacy jars, was its ability to carry painted inscriptions. Here the decorator has laid damp paper over the area of white tin-glaze to be inscribed, and then sprinkled powdered manganese over the rest of the mug to simulate the mottled appearance of German salt-glazed stoneware. The name was then added in cobalt blue.",
