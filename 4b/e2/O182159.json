The garment is made of silk cloth woven in colours on a red ground with vertical stripes, and lined with undyed plain woven cotton cloth. The neckline and front edge is bound with plain woven blue silk and seven blue knotted textile buttons have survived down the front . The small chest pocket with button and loop closure have been neatly stitched down, which might suggest professional production - or a skillful amateur.  A pair of trousers in the same material would have completed the outfit. Several textiles and complete garments from this burial ground, near Asyut, are in the collection of the V&A.",
