The corner posts are veneered in mahogany as plain pilasters, each side showing two flanking the bookshelves, the base with plain brass mounts, the capitals with cast brass capitals with a putto emerging from acanthus between scrolls. Above, the top is plainly veneered on the sides, with brass handles of swags of roses on the short sides. All the corners of the piece are squared. On the top surface a framing mount cast with water leaf surrounds a slab of grey porphyry marble, cut with square edges. There are three shelves which run right through the bookcase, veneered in mahogany, the edges set with a narrow 'balustrade', behind which the books (duodecimo) must locate. In the centre each shelf shows a hollow rectangle of similar raised fillet, to prevent the books being pushed in too far. On each long side, at each end of each shelf are two dummy books (with uniform bindings, but untitled) set against blocks of poplar, to fill the corners of the shelves. The frame mount is fixed with four screws through the corner tangs, each tang showing a vacant hole further out, on the inner edge of the frame itself, where the porphyry slab itself sits, held above the level of the carcase. The top of the carcase is keyed for glue. The underside of the slab is unevenly cut and is not polished.\n[Top] Grey marble slab",

            "history_note": "Part of a large group of pieces of French furniture, ceramics, metalwork, books and other decorative arts, from the late Empire period and earlier, acquired in Paris by Sir Charles Stuart (from 1828 1st Lord Stuart de Rothesay) (1779-1845).The Empire furnishings were probably purchased during his first period as ambassador to Paris (1815-1824), the earlier furnishings during his second embassy (1828-1830). The Empire furnishings may have been intended for  4 Carlton House Terrace which he acquired in the late 1820s and moved into in 1834. Older pieces were probably purchased for his country house, Highcliffe Castle, Hampshire (now Dorset), which was re-modelled and enlarged in the most ambitious Gothic style from 1830-1834, with some work continuing throughout the 1830s.  In 1841 the Carlton Terrace House was let. The family moved their London residence to Whitehall Yard. It was possibly in 1841 (or 1845, the date of Lord Stuart de Rothesay's death) that the Empire furnishings were moved to Highcliffe.\nLord Stuart de Rothesay's collections were inherited in 1845 by his wife Elisabeth, Lady Stuart de Rothesay (n\u00e9e Yorke). After her death, Highcliffe House and its contents passed to his second daughter, Louisa, Lady Waterford (1818-1891) who maintained Highcliffe. She left the house and its collections to her distant cousin, Major-General Edward Stuart Wortley (1857-1934). When his younger daughter Elizabeth ('Bettine') married Montagu Bertie, 8th Earl of Abingdon in 1928, he bought the castle and its contents from his father-in-law. The Abingdons sold Highcliffe and most of its contents in 1949 but retained a number of pieces, including all those which later formed the Hole Bequest to the V&A. After her husband's death in 1963, Lady Abingdon lived much of the time with her close friends, Mr and Mrs Tahu Hole, to whom she bequeathed all her personal possessions on her death in 1978. Tahu Hole died in 1985 and a year later his widow Joyce approached the Museum and offered the collection as a bequest. She died in December 1986 and, in accordance with her will, the Museum chose those items that it wished to add to its collections. Other items from the collection were sold to benefit the Museum and the proceeds added to the funds bequeathed.\n\nBoth bookcases are shown in the <i>Country Life</i> photographs of the Library at Highcliffe, flanking the chimneypiece in 1942. They did not figure in the 1949 sale.\n\nHistorical significance: This form of small open bookcase seems to have been Jean-Georges Hornig's speciality, the only type of furniture recorded as being made by him. A similar one, unmarked, was sold by Christie's London, 29 March 1979, lot 72.\n[Bookcase] Historical significance: The labels on this piece are the best-preserved of two varieties of label that appear in fragmentary form on many pieces in the collection. The small label printed with the Stuart arms almost invariably appears with the larger heart-shaped lables, suggesting that the latter is likely to relate to an inventory made for Sir Charles Stuart. As many of the labels are damaged, its absence now on some pieces with the other label is no indication that it was not there originally. The heart-shaped labels are close to those found on the furniture listed in the 1814 inventory of Pauline Borghese's furniture in the H\u00f4tel Char\u00f4st. Such labels are not recorded elsewhere. Though Pauline had left France by 1816 the question must remain open whether Sir Charles Stuart obtained some of her simpler furnishings for personal use, perhaps through an agent. Another possible explanation is that Sir Charles Stuart, recognising the necessity for making an inventory of his own possessions, employed the same agent, Michelot. Such furniture labels may turn out to be a speciality of this furniture broker.",

            "historical_context_note": "Jean-Georges Hornig (1779-1857) is recorded in the rue de Charonne in 1827. \n\nThe form of these low bookcases seems to derive from the cabinets in boulle marquetry made from 1770-95 by Etienne Levasseur (1721-98). On the bookcases similar corner pilasters are retained, here flanking books rather than the drawers or doors of the Levasseur pieces.",
