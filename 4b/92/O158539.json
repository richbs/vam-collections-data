            "physical_description": "Plain weave fine cotton, probably handwoven, embroidered with silk in straight stitches and pulled thread work; whitework.\nThe central panel has a triangular niche form with the spandrels decorated with a series of diagonal bands of 8-pointed stars; rectangles formed of 8 triangles and very narrow bands of pulled thread work. A line of 8-pointed stars outlines the niche form, the apex of which is patterned with a 'box' of triangles forming squares.  Beneath this are two lateral lines of small lozenges, tailing off, symbolizing a prayer rosary.  Further down a small central octagon of triangles [for mohr tablet?], and either side a longitudinal rectangle similarly patterned.  Below the small octagon, a lateral rectangle infilled with fine pulled thread work in repeated lozenges. Underneath this, a large broken rectangle of triangles in small squares [stylized bowl?] flanked either side by a vase/container form.  Below this a large rectangle with an inner hexagon of 8-pointed stars and triangles forming squares.\nThese sections are surrounded on three sides by a band of very fine pulled thread work forming thin diagonal lines, itself edged with arrowheads of straight stitches.  Between this and the main composite outer framing band, two lines of small stylized isolated plant forms, a theme expanded in the lower section patterned with spiky flowering stems emerging from a zigzag base.  The main composite outer band is formed of diagonal lines of triangles/squares and triangles either side of fine pulled thread netting.\nOn the back there is a small patch of printed cotton used to strengthen the ground fabric.\nCotton Thread: white, Z-spun\nEmbroidery Thread: white silk; 2S",
