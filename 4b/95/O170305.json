Philpot is also known as a painter, and executed an important decorative mural scheme for Mulberry House in London. His sculpture is in the tradition of Rodin, although he also epitomises an angular art deco style, which compares well with work by some of his British contemporaries, such as Eric Gill and Robert Gibbings.\nThis was the only sculptural work of Philpot which sold well during his lifetime.",
