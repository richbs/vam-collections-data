The series was a development from the simplified geometric work of the period 1976-82 and the first work in which Weiss painted his glass. He described the contrast between his previous work and the Baroque series in the following terms [letter to Michael Archer, 25 January 1985; Weiss, Dick, nominal file]: \"When you have pared down essences to 3 thin rectangles floating in a field of one colour, you are saying something; it is belief in universal laws...BUT, when you start going baroque, roccocco, then you are saying something else - it is reveling in the complexity of life, or shuddering at its lack of simple order. Things go this way, things wizz that way, things curl this way, things slink that way, it is hopeless to try to order them.\"",
