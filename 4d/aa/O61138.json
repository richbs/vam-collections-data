The role of the heartless Columbine was one of Karsavina's most celebrated roles, described by Beaumont as 'a Dresden china figure, but she had very human failings.  She was a heartless coquette who inspired admiration and then snubbed the fool who thought his affection would be returned.' The frothy, scallop-frilled costume set with a design of red cherries, was designed by Leon Bakst.  \nIt is possible that Beaumont commissioned the portrait from Adrian Allinson around 1918, when Allinson was working on Carnaval illustrations for the Impressions of the Russian Ballet series, published by Beaumont.  \nThe painting came to the Museum as part of the Cyril Beaumont Bequest.",
