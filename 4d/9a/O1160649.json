The production was funded by the Sciart project, funded by the Wellcome Institute, which sought to stimulate debate collaboratively between science and the arts. Baker conceived this project in consultation with psychologist Richard Hallam, with the subject matter being mental health.\n\nTaking the framework of a conference, Baker presented a new kind of therapy for mental illness, with her patient of choice being a pea. Video playback was used to make the pea visible, with the finale being a chorale performed by dancing peas on wires.\n\nThis set model depicts the main stage performance, in S.1299:1-2010, with Baker on stage presenting a powerpoint presentation. This was originally shown through a monitor in the back of the stage set. There are also many other scenes from the performance, shown in separate parts of the model, including the dancing peas on wires, and a giant pea on an armchair. The model also includes storyboards of how the piece is presented.",
