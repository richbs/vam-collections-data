            "history_note": "Emerson bought his first camera in 1881 and in 1885 founded the Camera Club of London. He was impressed by contemporary French painting, including that of the Impressionists, and argued for \u2018naturalistic\u2019 photography. For him, truth to nature consisted of accurately recreating the depth and density of space and atmosphere. Most of his pictures were taken in East Anglia in the 1880's, and his studies of landscapes, people at work, and scenes from daily life survive in the form of seven illustrated books, including 'Life and Landscape of the Norfolk Broads' and 'On English Lagoons'.",
