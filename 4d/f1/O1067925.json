Hodgkinson was the half-brother of John Everett Millais, the eldest son by his mother's first marriage. Mrs Clarke may have been the wife of C Purdon Clarke, who ultimately became Director of the Museum. \n\n<b>Literature:</b> Williamson 1904, vol. I, p. 72, pl. XLIII, fig. 5; <i>Catalogue of Miniatures</i>, 1908, p.8 (as Cooper); Foster 1914-16, vol. II, no. 529 ('on a playing card'); Long 1930, p. 13 ('ascription doubtful'); <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 9. \n\nOn the grounds of style this portrait should date from the later 1650s. It seems to relate most clearly to <i>John Manners, 8th Earl of Rutland</i> (1) and to <i>Sir William Palmer</i> (Cat. No. 75).(2) \n\nLong's doubts about the attribution are hard to understand, but may have been set off by Foster's statement that the painting was on a playing card. The damaged condition and the slightly coarse expressiveness of the brushwork increase the superficial impression of oddity. The style, however, does occur in Cooper's oeuvre for sitters like Hobbes whom age or philosophy had raised above flattery, and well represents the tendency in later seventeenth-century art away from the values of high finish. \n\nThe sitter appears to wear clerical or perhaps academic dress along with a skull cap, which was part of male informal and domestic attire. \n\n1 In the collection of the Dukes of Rutland at Belvoir Castle; signed and dated 1656. \n\n2 Signed and dated 1657.\u201d",
