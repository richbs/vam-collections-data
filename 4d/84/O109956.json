When he was dismissed in 1835, he conducted a brilliant campaign to expose the wasteful inefficiency of his former employers. His talent for publicity also helped achieve the introduction of the Penny Post (and he invented the Christmas card), but his great mission was to improve the quality of design in British manufacturing. Setting an example with his own small business, Felix Summerly's Art-Manufactures, started in 1847, Cole soon began educating manufacturers and the public on a much larger scale, when he became Prince Albert's chief adviser for the Great Exhibition of 1851. He went on to establish and manage the South Kensington Museum (now called the V&A) and a new Government department for education in art and science.",
