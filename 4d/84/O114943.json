Made from printed gabardine, showing abstract motifs in orange, white and brown, the dress has a small round collar and long sleeves. The matching shorts are worn under the dress and are not visible.\n\nBorn in France to Italian parents. Ungaro trained as a tailor, and then worked for Balenciaga and Courreges, whose influence is particularly evident here, and who was the first designer to introduce this concept in the mid-1960s. Ungaro\u2019s interpretation manifests itself through bold prints, which became the deisgner\u2019s hallmark.",
