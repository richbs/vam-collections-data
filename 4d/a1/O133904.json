He won official recognition in 1840 when Louis-Philippe bought one of his paintings (now destroyed) and was awarded the L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur two years later. Diday was also a prolific draughtsman and engraver.\n\nThis painting is a fine example of Diday\u2019s output. He essentially executed views of imposing mountains, in particular the Alps, characterised by a high degree of finish and atmospheric effects. The present composition was probably made in his studio thanks to sketches executed after nature (here at Bex, in the canton of Vaud, Switzerland). Diday is considered together with his pupil Alexandre Calame ((1810-1864) to be the leading member of the Swiss mountainous landscapists.",

Study from nature at Bex. By F. Diday. Signed. Swiss. Present century'; bequeathed by Rev. Chauncey Hare Townshend, 1868.\n\nHistorical significance: Considered the leading member of the Swiss mountain landscapists, Diday's aesthetic is not far from that of the Romantic movement and its use of nature as a mirror of the human and divine mind. The small house in the centre at mid-distance, perched on the top of a headland, is representative of such conception of an overwhelming and omnipotent nature against human fragility.\nThis painting was bequeathed by the Rev. Townshend who owned a large collection of 19th-century landscape paintings. It is not unlikely that Townshend, who resided part of the year in Lausanne, acquired this painting directly from the artist.",

Biedermeier painters were ideologically opposed to academic and religious painting and favoured such subject matter as portraits, landscapes and genre scenes, with still-lifes, especially of flowers. They share a similar technique in the use of separate, clear tones and a high degree of finish, reminiscent of Neo-Classicism while they tend to convey a greater sentimentality. By the 1880s, the influence of this artistic movement was on the wane and was even used pejoratively to characterize the reactionary bourgeois elements in society, which remained quite indifferent to social problems and cultivated a sense of order and sobriety, especially in the private sphere and the domestic realm.",
