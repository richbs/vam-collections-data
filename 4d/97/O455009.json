Four armed figures holding a trident, damaru drum(?), sword and bowl would nornally be identified as Shiva but such images do not normally come in pairs.  They may be guardian figures placed either side of a temple door.  Their form is highly inusual, with flat, hollow backs and made in two pieces, riveted together at the waist.  Each has a moustache and the sort of crown associated with Maharashtra masks.  Copper colour, little wear.\nPreviously mentioned in the Register as Khanderao, form of Shiva worshipped in the Maratha country; naked to the waist, except for two garlands,  He is four-handed; in the upper right is a  three-petalled lotus is missing, in the lower right is a short sword, in the upper  left a damaru and in the lower left a bowl.",
