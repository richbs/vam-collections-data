This work appears to have been painted after a mezzotint engraving ca. 1670-1690 by Abraham Blooteling after a design by Petrus Staverenus (fl. 1634-54). Staverenus designed a series of works representing the five senses as personified by peasants. This work in the series represents 'Hearing' due to the sound the man is making chinking the coins into his hand. The other known engravings in this series by Blooteling depict 'Sight,' 'Smell,' and 'Touch.' 'Taste' is missing from the series.  The series appears to have been particularly popular as it was also engraved in the 17th century by Pieter Schenck (1660-1713) and Jan Verkolje (1650-1693). The same work was engraved again in 1770-80 by the London publisher/printer Carington Bowles where it was expanded into a Satire, in which a young man with a pile of gold coins in his hands stands at a counter behind which a young woman stirs a bowl of punch, and was given the title Ha Ha Ha - I've got the Chink.  There may have also been a series of prints made in reverse as suggested by a painting attributed to Penry Williams ca. 1815/16  (no. 93, Cyfartha Castel Museum and Art Gallery, Merthyr, Wales) with the same title as the Bowles reproduction but reduced  to the original composition and painted in reverse .",

Staverenus designed a series of works representing the five senses as personified by peasants. This work in the series represents 'Hearing' due to the sound the man is making chinking the coins into his hand. The other known engravings in this series by Blooteling depict 'Sight,' 'Smell,' and 'Touch.' 'Taste' is missing from the series.  The series appears to have been particularly popular as it was also engraved in the 17th century by Pieter Schenck (1660-1713) and Jan Verkolje (1650-1693). The same work was engraved again in 1770-80 by the London publisher/printer Carington Bowles where it was expanded into a Satire, in which a young man with a pile of gold coins in his hands stands at a counter behind which a young woman stirs a bowl of punch, and was given the title <i>Ha Ha Ha - I've got the Chink</i>.  There may have also been a series of prints made in reverse as suggested by a painting attributed to Penry Williams ca. 1815/16  (no. 93, Cyfartha Castel Museum and Art Gallery, Merthyr, Wales) with the same title as the Bowles reproduction but reduced  to the original composition and painted in reverse .",

            "historical_context_note": "This work is typical of Genre Painting, a style which represented the lower or peasant classes of society that became increasingly popular throughout the 17th century in the Netherlands. These pictures usually depict scenes of everyday life, set in domestic interiors or in the open countryside. Some bear metaphorical meaning or moralising messages, but others may just be intended as representations of daily events. In both cases they are associated with health, pleasure and liberty. The leading figures of the Haarlem school in this field were Adriaen Brouwer (1606-1638) and Adriaen van Ostade (1610-1685).",
