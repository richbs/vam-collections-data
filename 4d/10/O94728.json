Founded by the Wilcox brothers in 1852 in Connecticut, it became one of the largest silver manufacturers in the United States by the time this piece was made in 1869. \n\nBritannia metal is a mixture of tin, antimony and copper. It looks like pewter and was pioneered in the Britannia Metal Works in Sheffield. From about 1850 onwards manufacturers used it (as here) as a base metal for electroplating, covering it with a thin coating of silver by electro-deposition. Electroplated wares were produced in the styles fashionable for silverware, such as the Neo-classical revival style you can see here.",
