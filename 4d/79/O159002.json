Many were solely decorative, to display the wealth and status of their owner. They were worn in the hat or belt, as well as carried in the hand. Gloves were popular as gifts and were exchanged as a gesture of engagement or wedding present. In combat, a glove was thrown down as a gage, or challenge.\n\nOrnately embroidered gloves served official purposes, signifying the holding of a civic office or membership in the local freemanry. They were also a popular New Year\u2019s gift to the monarch.   Gloves were frequently given as a sign of royal favour. The wardrobe accounts for William III for a single year record the making of more than 400 pairs of gloves. \n\nThe short, curved cuff edged with a heavy fringe of precious metal thread, cord and tassels is typical of late 17th-century men\u2019s gloves.",
