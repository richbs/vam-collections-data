In Catholic belief, bread and wine are mystically and miraculously transformed into the body and blood of Christ during the Mass. This central ceremony of the Catholic church is a re-enactment of the Last Supper, in which Christ shared bread and wine with his disciples, saying \u2018This is my body and blood\u2019. \n\nThis ciborium was made for a church of B\u00e9guines in Hasselt (Limburg) in the Southern Netherlands in 1651. B\u00e9guines were a religious group of women not bound by vows but drawn to the ideal of the simple life and an attachment to mysticism and worship of the Eucharist (the mystical moment of transformation). B\u00e9guinages were chiefly a medieval phenomenon, but there was a revival in the southern (Spanish) Netherlands in the 17th century.\n\nThe finial on the cover represents 'the pelican in her piety', a common symbol in Christian art for the sacrifice made by Christ for the redemption of mankind. Here the pelican plucks at her breast to shed blood to feed her young. The crucifix studded with crystals reminds us of the blood Christ shed on the Cross.",

Internal dissent was undermining its authority and whole nations were going over to the new Protestant faiths. To clarify its role, the church held the Council of Trent from 1545 to 1563. It addressed concerns about religious education, abuses of wealth and the relief of the poor. The Society of Jesus (the Jesuits) became the champion of the reformed Catholic church and promoted the faith worldwide. At the heart of this Counter Reformation was the need to restore the Eucharist to the centre of worship. In Catholic belief, the Eucharist enshrines the moment when bread and wine, consecrated at the altar, are transformed into the body and blood of Christ. A priest holding up a monstrance Detail from The Adoration of the Holy Eucharist, by Claudio Coello, 1685-90 Monasterio del Escorial, Madrid.\n\nArt and Faith \nThe image and message of the reinvigorated Roman Catholic church were actively promoted through dramatic architecture and furnishings. Throughout the 17th century new churches were built in the grand Baroque style. Their sumptuous interiors were complemented by elaborate monstrances, candelabra, sanctuary lamps and censers. Awe-inspiring altar silver drew the eyes of the faithful towards the Eucharist.",
