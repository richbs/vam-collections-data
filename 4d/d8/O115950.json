There is an attached paper label marked in ink 'BD40: 58inch: b120: VY'. \n\nIt is likely that this sample was held at the Warehouse and shown to prospective customers (shops and other retail outlets). It is likely that any orders would have involved various lengths which could be cut and hemmed to requirements. \n\nLittle is known of the supply of retail textile goods in London in the late 19th century so this linen provides important information on middlemen and warehouse procedure at the time.\n\nJohn Pollock, the donor's grandfather, worked at the Fore Street Warehouse Company Ltd from 1875, eventually becoming Director. The company is listed in the 1866 Post Office Directory as trading at 104-107 Fore Street, London.",
