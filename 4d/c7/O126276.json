His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nChristopher Fry\u2019s verse play The Dark is Light Enough (1954) is set in the Countess Rosmarin Ostenburg\u2019s country house at the time of the Hungarian rebellion against the Austrians, 1848-1850.  The dying Countess with pacifist principles selflessly harbours Gettner, her former son-in-law and deserter from the Hungarian army.  The play received mixed reviews following its transference to Broadway, New York in 1955.  Critics praised the acting and sets but objected to the play\u2019s obscure meaning.\n\nIn Act II, Gettner hides from Hungarian soldiers in the Countess\u2019s stables.  Fry subtitled the play \u2018a winter story\u2019; the stable doors are ajar, showing a tree covered in snow.   Messel enlivens the dark vaults of the stables with an ensemble of tools and implements in the foreground, reminicent of an old master still-life painting.",

It was directed by Peter Brook with music by Leslie Bridgewater and featured Edith Evans as the Countess and James Donald as Gettner.  The play ran for seven months in London and then went to New York where it opened in 1955 with Katharine Cornell as the Countess and Tyrone Power as Gettner.\nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's theatre designs and other designs and artefacts.  The designs were briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being housed at the V&A from 1981 on indefinite loan.  The V&A Theatre Museum purchased the Oliver Messel collection from Lord Snowdon in 2005.",
