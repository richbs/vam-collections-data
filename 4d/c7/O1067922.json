The inside packed out with fragments of playing cards (all diamonds). Lightly scratched on the back: <i>General/ Charles Churchill/ Brother of John/ Duke of Malborough/ by / [Dixon]</i>. \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> Acquired from an unrecorded source by George Salting; 1 by him bequeathed to the Museum, 1910. \n\n<b>Literature:</b> Long 1929, p. 128; Long 1930, p. 18, fig. 51; Reynolds 1959, pl. XI, no. 17; <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 16. \n\nThe only evidence for the identification is the scratched inscription on the case, and this, as so often with miniatures that passed through the trade in the late nineteenth century, is of little value. General Churchill, as an important soldier, Colonel of the Cold stream (1707-14) and youngest brother of the 1st Duke of Marlborough, has for long attracted the attention of military historians, who have commented on the lack of portraits of him. In these circumstances plausible images of the right date acquire on the market the desired identity. \n\nDuring correspondence with Jonathan Mayne, (2) Major Edward Christie- Miller supplied a photograph of a portrait of 1707 by Kneller (then in the possession of Colonel George Gould in Dorset) identified as Charles Churchill. Presumably the same inducements may have affected the identification of this portrait. Graham Reynolds commented that the resemblance between it and the miniature was slight. \n\nStylistically the miniature demonstrates the tendency of Dixon's style after the mid-1670s towards an increasingly painterly brushwork. With its sky background, it is one of the exceptions to Long's rule: 'The backgrounds of Dixon's original miniatures are usually featureless\u2019. (3) See also Cat.
