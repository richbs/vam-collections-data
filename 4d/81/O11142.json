It is an example of early Victorian design, which was sometimes overlaid with an improving message and a narrative subject.\n\nHistorical Associations\nIn response to the Society of Arts' offer, made in 1845, of a prize for designs for a tea service, Henry Cole (1808-1882), using the pseudonym Felix Summerly, produced a design that was executed by Minton.  This won a silver medal in the competition held in 1846 and the experience led Cole to believe that it would 'promote public taste' if well-known painters and sculptors could be persuaded to produce designs for similar functional objects.  Accordingly, in 1847 he founded 'Summerly's Art Manufactures', which lasted for about three years, until his preoccupation with the Great Exhibition of 1851 brought it to an end. However, for some years afterwards individual firms continued to produce objects originally made for Summerly's.\n\nPeople\nJohn Linnell seems to have been employed by Minton solely to decorate wares for Summerly's Art Manufactures.  He was a student at the Royal Academy Schools, which he entered in 1805, and he was a pupil of John Varley.  He specialised first in portraits and later in landscapes.",
