As she describes it: 'A tide of criticism over Iraq threatens to swamp Number 10 as Blair grasps at straws. His credibility is at an all-time low as polls reveal a profound mistrust in his judgement. It is commonly believed that Blair exaggerated the threat to Britain\u2019s security in his zeal to convince the British public of his decision to join forced with America and attack Iraq. Calls for Blair to resign reach a crescendo as claims emerge in the US that British intelligence was \u201cfixed\u201d in order to support the war in Iraq.'\n\n'Marf' drew daily topical cartoons for the Evening Standard between March 2002 and August 2005, moving to the Londoner's Diary page in August 2003. The drawings cover key political and social issues of the period, providing a vivid and often hilarious response to the main news of the day. The Evening Standard is London's only evening newspaper, publishing up to five editions a day. In Marf's own words: 'The cartoonist needs to keep up with the rapid pace of event.'",
