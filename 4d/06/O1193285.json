The cardboard backing is printed in a design showing the cratered surface of a moon in light blues, pinks and greens in the bottom-right corner, stars down the right side and text on the left side. The reverse of the backing lists the different models available in the series, gives information about the series in six different languages and has four colour photographs of different products in the series.",
