A complex wood and paper rose surrounded by chequered decoration of ivory and ebony inlay. The fixed bridge, with grooves for strings which pass over it, replaces an earlier bridge. There are five hitch nails at the base of the body for attachment of the strings. The neck has eleven ivory frets topped with brass, and an extra fret has been added on the belly. The head, later than the body, has fourteen small pegs, for five courses of wire strings, the first double, the rest triple.'
