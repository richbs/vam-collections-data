Among the 30 designs included are the vases Petitot developed to adorn the court gardens along with other more fantastic creations that were probably never realised but ensured the success of the suite which was re-issued and copied numerous times. Today the suite is famous among print and ornament specialists both for the singularly atypical approach it takes to a stock ornamental motif and for the beauty of Bossi's refined etching tehnique.",

The suite is frequently cited in the literature as both the 'Suite <i>de</i> Vases' and the 'Suite <i>des</i> Vases'.
