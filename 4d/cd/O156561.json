            "public_access_description": "This box is an example of political propaganda during the Seven Years' War (1756-63), with the major areas of the conflict in central Europe mapped on the outside. The allies around Prussia, including Hanover, are prominently placed on the top, while Austria is shown fragmented at the margins. The inside of the lid is painted with a map of the Indian subcontinent, and a map of North America decorates the base. In these parts of the world, British and French colonial interests also culminated in military conflict at this time.\n\nSimilar boxes are known, and depict either maps or a portrait of Frederick the Great in celebration of Prussian supremacy in 1757, when the Prussian Army won two important battles at Rossbach and Leuthen. The date 1757 is also given on this box, meaning that it is therefore likely to have been made in Berlin, a centre of the production of enamel boxes, as a souvenir of the successful campaigns of the year. The maps painted on this box are not just an example of political propaganda however, but also of a trend at the time for giving snuffboxes the look of everyday objects, such as letters.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert (1913-2001) and his wife Rosalinde (1913-1995) formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  The collection is on long-term loan to the Victoria and Albert Museum.",

The duchy had become Prussian territory during the War of the Austrian Succession (1740-48) when King Frederick the Great of Prussia (1712-86) defeated Empress Maria Theresa of Austria. All major European powers of the time became involved: Prussia, Great Britain and Hanover opposed Austria and its main allies, France, Russia, Sweden and Spain. Colonial interests outside Europe led to an escalation of the war into what might be considered the first global conflict.\n\nThe box is inscribed with the names Charles Beduzzi and Jordan Scheydl. Charles Truman found references to both names indicating Vienna as a place of activity, however, this seems unlikely, as the maps painted upon the box depict Austria fragmented at the margins. Though the possibility of the box being of Viennese origin cannot be ruled out, Berlin seems a much more likely option.",
