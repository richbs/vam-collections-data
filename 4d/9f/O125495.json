            "public_access_description": "Object Type\n\nIn Britain paper printed or painted with patterns has been used for decorating walls since the 16th century. By the late 1860s it had become fashionable to divide the walls into three sections, and to use different but complementary wallpaper patterns for each section. This panel was made for display purposes and has all three patterns printed as one piece.\n\nOwnership & Use\n\nWallpaper decorations of this kind were first described by Charles Eastlake in his guide to home decorating Hints on Household Taste, which was first published in 1868. He approved of them because he thought that having only one pattern on the wall could be monotonous. By the 1880s this style of decorating was commonplace. In their advertisements Jeffrey & Co. offered a great variety of designs for dado, filling and frieze suitable for private residences.\n\nDesign & Designing\n\nThe dado was the bottom section of the wall, below the chair rail; the filling was the deepest section, between the chair rail and the picture rail; above this was the narrowest band, the frieze. Paintings were hung from the picture rail, with the filling as their background, so this was generally the simplest and most restrained pattern of the three. In 1886 a writer in the Journal of Decorative Art set out the basic principles for designing such papers. He said, 'The frieze should be light and lively; richer colours should be employed than in the filling, and it should be as striking to the eye as the dado'.",
