Three more bosses from this series, showing the other symbols of the evangelists, were also given to the museum by Sebastian Pugin in 1945 (A.15 to A.17-1945), and the decorative scheme was completed by bosses of the Virgin and Child or God the Father (now lost) and the four Fathers of the Church.  Three of these - St Augustine, St Jerome and St Gregory the Great - remain in Utrecht at the Centraal Museum.\n\nJan van Schayck was one of the principal sculptors working in Utrecht around 1500, and records show that he carried out several commissions in the cathedral there. One of these was to carve 'the bosses and capitals with half-figures in the library', for which he was paid in 1497, and the documentary evidence coupled with the material remains leave little room for doubt that the bosses now in London and Utrecht are his work. The records also indicate that the sculptures were painted, as was customary, by two other specialists, Ernst van Schayck and Dirck Scay.",

The painting of the sculptures was executed by Ernst van Schayck and Dirck Scay.\nThe sculptures remained in Utrecht Cathedral, probably until the beginning of the 19th century; they then entered the collection of the lawyer and archivist  Petrus van Musschenbroek (1764-1823) Utrecht, until 1826; Musschenbroek collection sale, Leiden,1826: Collection of A.W.N. Pugin (1812-1852) and thence by descent to his grandson Sebastian Pugin Powell (1866-1947); given to the Victoria and Albert Museum by Sebastian Pugin Powell in 1945.",

Such an iconographic programme would have been eminently suitable for the decoration of a library, reminding those below of the writings in the four Gospels and the achievements of the four great scholars of the early church, and a virtually identical programme - but this time with a boss of the Virgin and Child at the centre  - is also seen in the treasury of Cologne cathedral, which was originally a library.",
