In this drawing dated 1999 they show how the internal space will be divided. The colour code and the notes on the right indicate the distribution of public areas (yellow), the mayor\u2019s accommodation (red), the assembly secretariat (green), common services (purple) and the assembly chamber (mauve). The drawing was made using Computer Aided Design (CAD) and shows a \u2018section\u2019, where the building appears to have been cut in half. It is not the kind of seductive image intended to impress a client or to wow the public. Instead it is a means of communicating design information through simple graphics, and in this it is very successful. The Victoria and Albert Museum holds several similar drawings from the same scheme, each one dealing with a different design issue.",
