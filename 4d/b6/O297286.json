Indigo dyeing was done by women using large earthenware dye pots partially sunk into the ground.  The small circles were created by tying small stones or seeds into the cloths while the larger cloths are made by raising a point of cloth and then binding the cloth below tightly, leaving a larger round area of white.  In this example it is possible to see a large circle that has not been bound tightly enough and is therefore pale blue rather than white.\n\nAdire cloths were worn as wraparound skirts.  They were not particularly prestigious but during the 1960s they were extremely popular.  Part of their success lay in the fact that they were inexpensive and could be made quickly in response to changing fashions.",
