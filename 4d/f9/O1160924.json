Bruce was the vocalist and bass guitarist in the 1960s rock band Cream, but after the band split up in 1968, Bruce went solo. He continued collaborative efforts with many different artists and Mick Taylor played guitar on his 1975 tour. The musical score is for the song Smiles and Grins; Bruce handwrote these pages for Taylor.\n\nMick Taylor was guitarist with the Rolling Stones between 1969 and 1974, and followed this by playing as guest guitarist for many other artists, as well as pursuing a solo career. He is known as a great technical guitarist and is famous for his slide guitar playing. The Theatre and Performance department also holds an example of one of his guitar slides (S.999-2010).",
