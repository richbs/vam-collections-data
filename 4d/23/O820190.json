Volume II. 17th-18th century</u>, London, 1979, pp. 100-101 The following is the full text of the entry: View of the Palazzo Barberini, Rome, Bernini's triton fountain in the foregro Pen and ink and wash slightly heightei with white 7 5/8 x 10 \u00bd (168 x 267) E\u20224463-1920 PROVENANCE Dr Benno Geiger (sale, Christie, 7 December 1920, lot 96; bought by the Museum) LITERATURE Planiscig and Voss, <i>Handzeiehnungen</i>, p. 23, no. 68 and pl. 68 The fountain was completed in 1643. Planiscig and Voss attributed the drawing to G. B. Falda and described it as a study for the engraving in <i>Le fontane di Roma</i> (1675); but a comparison with the plate shows that the row of buildings behind the fountain is shown quite differently there, and it is hard to believe that two views of the same piazza can be so unlike and yet by the same hand. A good example of a design by Falda for one of the engravings in <i>Le fontane di Roma</i> is in W. Vitzthum, <i>I disegni dei maestri. Il barocco a Roma</i>, 1970, fig. 2 (Berlin, Staatliche Museen, Kupferstichkabinett). It corresponds closely with the engraving.",
