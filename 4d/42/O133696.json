Pupil of John Crome 1811-14, exhibited at the Norwich Society of Artists from 1811 and elected Member 1812. Entered RA Schools 1815. Exhibited 65 works at the RA between 1811 and 1859, 136 at the BI 1814-59, 53 (including seven watercolours) at the SBA, and also at the watercolour societies. Subjects all landscapes, often with figures and animals. Published 'The Scenery of the Rivers of Norfolk' (1827-34). Died Hampstead, London, 24 March 1859; his son Arthur James Stark was also an artist. An exhibition of his works was held in Norwich in 1887; several drawings and watercolours are also in the V&A collections. \n\nLIT: <u>Art Journal </u>1850, p182, 1859, p135 (obit); H Day <u>East Anglian Painters</u> 11, 1968, pp56-77 \n\n\n<b>Distant View of Windsor </b>\nFA195 \nPanel, 26.6 X 21.2 cm (10\u00bd X 8 3/8 ins) \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nStark lived at 10 York Place, Windsor, from 1839 to 1849, the<u> Art Journal</u> in 1850 (p182) commenting 'the splendid oaks and beeches of the Forest and Park furnishing many subjects for his pencil'. His first Windsor subject to be exhibited was at the SBA in 1833, and there were several others in the 1840s and early 1850s. The present work could possibly be 'Beech Trees near the Statue, Looking towards Windsor Castle' exhibited at the RA in 1841. \n\nEXH: ?RA 1841 (134) \n\n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
