The current palace was largely constructed from 1309 to 1424 on 9th century origins, designed perhaps by Filippo Calendario. \nThe palace was the residence of the Doge and contained the offices of a number of political institutions. The Doge was the chief magistrate of the Republic of Venice, and this title was awarded for life and usually went to the shrewdest elder in the city. \nThis design drawing is for the ceiling of the Sala del Senato (Senate Hall). The Sala del Senato was used by government bodies to make foreign policy decisions such as appointing new ambassadors.\nAccording to Wolters (see textual reference citation) the two men mentioned in the inscription within the central panel of the design, apart from Sorte, were Andrea da Faenza and Francesco da San Moise, the two craftsmen who were mainly responsible for constructing the wooden ceiling in the Sala del Senato after the fire of 1574 which destroyed some of the rooms in this wing of the palace. The correction (pentimento) pasted over the original design in the lower left corner corresponds most closely with the ceiling as executed, but there were many changes made in the course of carrying out the design.",
