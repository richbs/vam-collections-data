Anyone who sets fire to the trees, they say, may be struck blind - by the spirits of the forest blowing the smoke back into his face. So much forest is now in flames that great bands of fire, spreading across much of the tropics can easily be seen from space. And it seems, we <i>are</i> being afflicted by a kind of blindness. As the forest burns, a million species may soon become extinct. water sources on which a billion people depend for food are likely to dry up. The land will turn to desert. And the worlds climate itself will change. And yet the destruction is often merely to provide packaging for consumer foods, or to cut the price of a hamburger. Much serves short-term political ends, to de-fuse pressure for social reforms. It is as if the smoke, blowing back from the forest, were fatally shortening our sight.",
