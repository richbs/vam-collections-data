Her unsettling fashion photographs have been influential in defining British magazines such as The Face and i-D. The photographer's work has received international acclaim for the blending of commercial photographic style with startling narratives, often psychological and sexual in nature.  \n\nThe use of digital manipulation in Widow (Red) is more subtle than in the photographer's previous work. Visible only at the bottom, the male appears to float across the image.",
