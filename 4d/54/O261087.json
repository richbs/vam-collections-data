The statutes of silk weaving guilds laid down the composition and structure of fabrics, and they could vary according to where they were made. The materials, technique and pattern sometimes determined the name of the fabric. This modest silk conforms to a type called camacas in the statutes for the city of Lucca in 1376. Some were made of silk alone, others had small details brocaded in metal thread. \n\nIt is possible that yet others were made with much more gold thread, just like those depicted in paintings by the Italian artist Bernardo Daddi (active 1312; d. 1348) in works such as the Anunciation from the Virgin and Child Enthroned with Six Saints in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. Daddi was careful in selecting the most appropriate textiles for different roles in his religious paintings: these textiles were chosen only for cloths of honour, wall hangings, or drapery for the Virgin's throne while he represented the earthly donors in much less showy textiles.",
