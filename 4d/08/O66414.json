Along with British designer, Tom Dixon, Brazier-Jones formed the group 'Creative Salvage' in the 1980s, recycling materials to create new pieces of furniture.  \n\nDesigned in 1986, this sconce has been in constant production ever since. This example was made in 2001. It is made of cast, moulded and hand-finished components. The laurel leaf motif is typical of the designer\u2019s work, in its reference to ancient civilizations. Brazier-Jones also likes to experiment with light and here employs glass spheres and domed lenses to create different moods through colour and distortion.",
