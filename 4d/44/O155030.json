While the costumes of a century ago are easy to distill into a form acceptable to audiences, designing costumes from a past that lies within living memory presents more problems.  However, by 1983, the costumes of the late 1930s and 1940s were just far enough away from the 1980s as to no longer seem dowdy or old fashioned, and were beginning to take on the aura of nostalgia.  In Alison Chitty's designs the period feel lay less in the cut and silhouette of the costumes than in the details - the width of shoulder straps, the peep-toe shoes, the length of sleeves with cuffs, the type of belt and the choice of fabrics.  Designing such productions may seem less exciting than the spectacular or fantastical, but creating believable costumes for the characters to inhabit calls for no less imaginative skill.",
