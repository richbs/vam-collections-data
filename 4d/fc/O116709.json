It was one of the V&A's early purchases of Chinese art through the good offices of Dr Stephen Wootton Bushell (1844-1908). Bushell was a physician by profession, but his 30-year-long residence in Beijing had made him a self-taught expert. He made several acquisitions on behalf of the V&A and in 1898 was commissioned by the Board of Education to write a comprehensive book on Chinese art, which has been reprinted several times.\n \nThe ceramics Bushell selected on behalf of the Museum included blue-and-white and colour-enamelled wares, which were fashionable in the late 19th century. But he did not overlook the more subtle monochromes which were, a few decades later, much appreciated by collectors and connoisseurs.",
