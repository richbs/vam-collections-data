It was originally a pectoral cross: small holes around the edge of the cross indicate that it was formerly framed with a gold strip and the three larger holes around the body of Christ may have served to hold nails which affixed to the back of the cross (probably of precious metal) to the front.  There are two small cavities in the back of the cross, presumably containers for relics.  The cross is worn and the head of Longinus and the right foot of Stephaton are missing. The front of the plaque may have been further embellished with gold leaf or foil glued to the roughened background, which would also have concealed the three large holes.",

There are two small cavities in the back of the cross, presumably containers for relics.  The cross is worn and the head of Longinus and the right foot of Stephaton are missing.",
