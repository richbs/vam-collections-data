Dr Chamberlen (1664\u20131728) was a midwife and famous for his early use of forceps. He is shown in the robes of the Royal College of Physicians. This is a model for a marble monument in Westminster Abbey, London.\n\nPeter Scheemakers (1691-1781) is one of the leading sculptors working in Britain in the mid-18th century, and was renowned for his tombs and portrait busts in particular. His training in the Netherlands would have included the modelling of terracottas.",
