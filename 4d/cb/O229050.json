From the 1950s until the 70s he was regularly commissioned by companies such as English Electric, Ford, Shell and Philips.\n\nBroomfield sought to elevate the figure of the worker.  Through careful composition and strong lighting his photographs create a sense of the drama and atmosphere of labour.  As manufacturing has turned to cheaper markets overseas, these photographs serve as a reminder of an important moment in Britain's industrial history."
