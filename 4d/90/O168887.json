Stanhope enjoyed a distinguished military and political career, including positions as Chancellor of the Exchequer and Secretary of State. The monument was erected in Westminster Abbey more than a decade after his death.\n\nSculptures known to have been designed by Kent are relatively few but are accorded positions of great prominence. In Westminster Abbey Kent designed the monuments to Newton and Earl Stanhope (both carved by John Michael Rysbrack) and to Shakespeare (carved by Peter Scheemakers) and received substantial fees for doing so. Vertue records that Kent was paid the large sum of \u00a350 for supplying the design for this monument. Kent also designed the figures of Palladio and Inigo Jones (carved by Rysbrack) for the entrance front of Lord Burlington's Chiswick House. It is, therefore, possible that he may have designed sculptures for other locations.",
