Sk\u00e5ne province, in the extreme south of Sweden, has the richest tradition, and more jewellery was worn there than in any other district.   Almost all the Swedish traditional jewellery at the V&A comes from Sk\u00e5ne.  \n\nSwedish rings were usually made of thin sheet silver, often decorated with coloured glass or pendants.  They were generally given at marriage, but were part of the dowry wealth, not true wedding rings.  The bride and groom did not exchange rings in Sweden until the late 19th century.  The two sets of initials engraved on the inside of the shank of this ring are probably those of the bridal pair. \n\nRings with tiny pendant ringlets, like this one, were worn throughout Norway and Sweden, although they are often thought of as typical of Lapland, in the extreme north.",
