This has the inscription RICHARD LENARD FOUNDER AT BRED FOURNIS. The ironmaster, who had the founder at Brede, Sussex from 1605 is shown with his dog and the tools and products of his trade. In the bottom left hand corner is the furnace with its tall chimney - one of the earliest images of a British foundry. The Museum's version lacks the inscription, date and shield, and its surface is less crisp, suggesting that it may be a later casting of a popular pattern.",
