He had designed for the stage in Australia but it was in Britain that his theatrical career developed. His spectacular sets and costumes for Michael Benthall's 1951 production of The Tempest at Stratford-upon-Avon established him as a leading designer. Sainthill's work encompassed  opera, notably Rimsky-Korsakov's Le Coq d'Or at Covent Garden in 1954, Shakespeare, pantomimes, musicals and revues, and although he became associated with a flamboyant and opulent fantastical style of design, he could also create an everyday reality, as demonstrated  by his interiors for the film version of John Osborne's play, Look Back in Anger.\n\nSainthill designed the sets and costumes for the Old Vic's Antony and Cleopatra which was directed by Robert Helpmann, with Keith Michell as Antony and Margaret Whiting as Cleopatra.",
