It was probably made in the eastern Deccan where many Buddhist bronzes have been found, especially in the Krishna Delta, and falls between the traditions of the north-west Deccan and developments in southern India, Sri Lanka and South-east Asia.  The left hand is in a position of kataka mudra, and as though holding a lotus.  The upper garment is worn in sacred-thread style (vastra-vajnopavita), the ends hanging loose behind and extending to the elbow.  The hair is dressed high in ascetic fashion (jata makuta), and two long braided strands hang down to the shoulders, terminating in loose curls.  The jata is decked in front with a flower, and on the lower forehead there is a faint  trace of a lightly engraved circle indicating a mahapurusha lakshana (conventional sign of distinction).  Ear lobes are extended and each decorated with a small bead or pearl.  A single bangle is worn on the left wrist.",
