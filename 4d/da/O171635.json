Its plain design was part of the movement in fashion away from what were considered by some to be the extravagant excesses of the late eighteenth century.  The move was towards a simpler, purer style of dress and footwear that was influenced by designs from classical antiquity. \n\nSlippers, or 'sandal shoes', continued to be worn well into the mid-century although by the 1850s they were used mainly for formal wear in black or white.  This pair is a typical example of that style.  The thin leather sole and delicately hand-stitched uppers were relatively simple and cheap to produce.  The small black bow at the throat was a standard feature put there by the manufacturer which was often later covered up by more elaborate decoration according to the tastes of the retailer or owner.  Other surviving examples of sandal shoes customised with rosettes, bows and ribbon ankle ties are evidence of this.",
