The poster tells us the age (53), profession (geologist) and family status (2 children) of the candidate. The party had a distinguished past, but disappeared from the political scene in 1948 after merging with the Communist Party. In 1990 it had no leaders of real authority and had difficulty in redefining itself.  There are four formulas representing the party on the poster: the new red rose emblem, the full name of the party, the carefully designed abbreviation \u2018SZDP\u2019 and the old nickname \u2019szocdemek\u2019.\n\nThe poster was issued by the 9th electoral district in Budapest. Although it is a local production, the designer has carefully reproduced and composed all the elements that appeared on the posters that were published by the party headquarters. \nBesides presenting the candidate, the text on the poster promotes one of the party\u2019s important general principals:  its good connection to Europe\u2019s social democrats.",
