Nothing is known about who originally comissioned them, but it seems probable that their original owners were rather wealthy, as all metals were costly at this date. This candlestick is made of bronze (an alloy of copper tin and zinc), which was less costly than gold or silver.\n\nIts pricket demonstrates how the medieval candlestick functioned; candle holders or sockets did not come into use until the 13th century. The three feet at the base of the object is another typical feature of the medieval candlestick. The design of this candlestick (in the form of a dragon) highlights a fashion during the 13th century for depicting animals and humans upon candlesticks. Falke and Meyer relate the V&A piece to a very similar candlestick, which depicts a winged dragon with head curled backwards. Another of their examples represents a dragon in combat with a knight who stands upon his back.\n\nThe dragon is a fantastical creature found in the ancient mythologies of Egypt, Greece and Rome. The dragon/serpent also features in the Bible (for example Job 41). Inspired by these examples, medieval bestiaries described the dragon as a winged beast with the tail of a serpent, pestilent breath and the ability to breathe fire. These monstrous characteristics reinforced the significance of the dragon as a hellish incarnation of Satan. However, the dragon also had more positive symbolic qualities. Owing to its near invincible strength, the dragon was also considered suitable as a guardian or protector, decorating the facades of holy places. In secular terms the dragon was a formidable opponent. In medieval Romances such as <u>Tristan</u>, knights proved their worth and their strength by defeating a dragon.",
