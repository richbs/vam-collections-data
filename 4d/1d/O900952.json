Only one print of the series resides in the V&A collection, the design for the large ornamental urn, but given Charles de Moelder\u2019s interest in ornamental design, it is likely that the other plates in the series exhibited a similar interest in classical mythological scenes and Baroque ornamentation. The image differs from some of Moelder\u2019s other designs both in scale and in presentation; many of his designs were smaller and appeared several to a page. Done to a high standard, the images in the Ranelagh series fill the page, and it is likely that they were made to be enjoyed for themselves, more than to be used as guide for the manufacture of three dimensional counterparts. With its intricate shadowing, the vase in this plate actually seems to occupy a physical space, rather than simply appearing as a two-dimensional design. Surrounding the vase in relief is a Bacchic procession, which shows various revellers, both men and women, engaged in a wine-fuelled celebration of the Bacchus, the Roman diety. It is tempting to think that the subject of the piece was designed with the Viscount, who was a well known pleasure-seeker, in mind. In fact, Bacchic scenes, like most scenes from classical mythology were common choices for all late seventeenth century design.",
