Gomme Ltd, in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, introduced the G-Plan range of furniture in 1953. G-Plan furniture was designed so that all the individual items would be compatible in style and dimensions and marked the beginning of modular furniture for the mass market. \n\nThe chests of drawers in this bedroom unit could be freestanding, or combined with the dressing table that is suspended between them. The dressing-table unit could not be used independently and in fact was never actually installed until the Museum acquired it. The timber handles and clean lines were also used in the matching wardrobes.\n\nG-Plan was promoted to the more affluent buyers who might be sympathetic to contemporary design ideas imported from Europe. These chests of drawers each cost \u00a319 11s 6d and the suspended dressing table was a further \u00a316 12s 6d. This was a considerable sum for new furniture in 1957.",
