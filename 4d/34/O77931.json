A handful of examples survive.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe proprietors of the new Chlesea factory, desperate for models, no doubt looked at the new, cheap, slip-cast teapots then being mass-produced in Staffordshire and attempted to make a fashionable version with more style. It is thought that the inspiration for this piece was the range of Grotesque (fancifully decorated) porcelain teapots made in France at Saint-Cloud, with which the Chelsea factory manager, Nicholas Sprimont (born about 1716; died 1771), would have been familiar. But whereas the Saint-Cloud porcelains are smooth, glassy and very white, the early Chelsea porcelain paste is much less refined, while the finer details of modelling are obscured by a thick opaque-white glaze containing tin oxide. These early white products were soon succeeded by enamelled wares of great refinement.",
