The cabinet is rectangular in form, mounted on a low plinth, and with inset Corinthian columns at either front corner, supporting the frieze section, which is set with three drawers.  The main carcase of the cupboard is enclosed by two doors of unequal width, meeting to the left of the central panel. The marble slab sits within a gilt-bronze mount on the top edge.  The cupboard is veneered on the front and sides with panels of Japanese lacquer showing trails of plants and birds, the outer two panels on the front with an applied oval of lacquer in the centre, framed by a gilt-bronze mount.  The carcase of the cupboard is in oak and poplar, the cupboard lined with  bois satin\u00e9.  The drawers are of oak, with mahogany front panels, ebonised on the front surface and set with gilt-bronze mounts.  The side drawers, and the side panels of the frieze are set with mounts of foliated scrolls, centreing on a ram's mask.  The centre drawer is set with a mount of interlaced floral swags, centreing on the monogram MA.  On the front and sides of the cabinet, the frieze areas above the front columns are set with mounts in the form of lidded urns with flowers.  The four drawers of the cupboard are operated by spring catches set on the upper and lower edge of the main drawer compartment",

            "public_access_description": "French furniture made in the eighteenth century was avidly collected from about 1840 and pieces associated with Marie-Antoinette, the last queen of France, were particularly sought after.  The queen, who followed her husband, Louis XVI to the guillotine in 1793, became a tragic heroine.  Enthusiasm for her story was taken up by the court of the Empress Eug\u00e9nie, wife of Napol\u00e9on III of France in the 1850s and was soon widespread.  Those who could not obtain pieces that had belonged to her provided a ready market for modern pieces in the style that she favoured and this piece is typical of such revival styles. The cupboard is veneered with Japanese lacquer, reminding the user of Marie-Antoinette's enthusiasm for this material, although this lacquer clearly dates from the 1860s or later, and the central drawer shows a mount that includes her monogram 'MA'.  \n\nOn loan to Cliffe Castle Museum.",
