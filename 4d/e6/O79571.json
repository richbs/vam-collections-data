Many of those made in Egypt were made of heavy twisted wire, like this, and often carry Egyptian silver marks.  Although this bracelet was made in Egypt, as the marks show, it was probably intended for sale in Syria.  Egyptian silversmiths had been making jewellery for the nomadic tribes who roamed the desert between Egypt and Syria for centuries, and knew exactly what designs were appropriate.\n\nThis example was bought for the Museum for 12 shillings at the International Exhibition, London, 1872 as an example of Egyptian traditional jewellery.  Henry Cole, the director, had arranged with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that British representatives abroad should send examples of peasant jewellery to the exhibition from \u2018all parts of the world, which should become public property, for exhibition in the Museum after the close of the Exhibition\u2019.  The jewellery that resulted from this initiative was duly put on show, and proved extremely popular.  Many London jewellers imported examples of the pieces displayed, and this kind of traditional jewellery remained fashionable until the end of the century.  A bracelet very similar to this one can be seen in the Liberty & Co 1895 catalogue, described as a \u2018Damascus Single Twist Bangle\u2019.",
