The Palais Royal was redecorated internally by Gilles Marie Oppenord from 1716 onwards; all trace of this decoration has since disappeared. As Oppenord's one-time pupil, Blondel would have encouraged his own pupils to study his works. 5712.8 and 5712.9 are probably taken from the tops of windows and overmante! mirrors in the Salon a I'Italienne (1717). 5712.8 was adapted in a design for a mausoleum made in Rome (see 5712.183), The chimneypiece (5712.10) is from the hernicycle of the gallery, made in 1717. Its graphic style, and differences in detail from a print of the gallery wall in Blondel's Cours d' Architecture suggest that Chambers was copying a drawing by Oppenord rather than the installed chimneypiece.",
