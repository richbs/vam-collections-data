            "public_access_description": "The enamelled and gilded decoration on this salt-glazed stoneware tankard stands out so dramatically because a very dark brown slip was used to conceal the lighter reddish-brown of the stoneware beneath. The applied relief-moulded features, notably the portrait bust of a prince or aristocrat and the bunches of cherries, enhance the effect still further. Such work is traditionally ascribed to the Saxon town of  Annaberg which lies in the mineral-rich Ore Mountain Range region (Erzgebirge). However, ceramic finds from excavations in  Dippoldiswalde, about 80km. north-east of Annaberg, have now called into question this attribution.",
