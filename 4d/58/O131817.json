            "history_note": "Bequeathed by Henry Pulsford Hobson, 1921\n\nHistorical Significance: Sir Henry Raeburn was the son of a businessman in the textile trade. Both of his parents died when he was a child and he was subsequently supported by his elder brother William. Raeburn\u2019s first experience in art was through an apprenticeship with James Gilliland, a jeweller. The decoration of jeweller\u2019s materials and the related art of miniature painting were crucial parts of Raeburn\u2019s artistic formation. Despite the characteristic breadth of handling, this early experience is visible in passages of fine detail in his mature work.\n\nExamples of Raeburn\u2019s early portraits include the quarter-length &lt;i&gt;James Hutton&lt;/i&gt; (1778; Edinburgh, National Galleries of Scotland) and the famous &lt;i&gt;Rev. Robert Walker Skating on Duddingston Loch&lt;/i&gt; (1784 (?); Edinburgh, National Galleries of Scotland). The latter work shows a confidence of design and a precise control of light and shadow. Its style and quality foreshadow the maturity of the 1790s, and for that reason the early date has been disputed.\n\nIn 1784 Raeburn travelled to Rome via London, where he possibly met Joshua Reynolds (1723-1792). There is little evidence as to how Raeburn used his time in Italy, although works such as &lt;i&gt;Admiral Inglis&lt;/i&gt; (1780s; Edinburgh, NGS) show chromatic values which may be related to Pompeo Batoni (1708-1787), the most popular portrait painter among English tourists in Rome. \n\nSir Henry Raeburn came back to Edinburgh around 1786, and later established a successful practice as a portrait painter. He practically eliminated all competition on the market, and therefore his paintings serve as a magnificent insight into the society of the time. Raeburn developed a personal style based on direct observation, bold handling of the brush and lack of a preparatory layer of drawing. However, his background in miniature painting remained influential in his handling of costumes and areas of still-life. \n\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century Raeburn\u2019s introduced cooler colour schemes and a neo-classical elegance of line. His work at the time shows a remarkable range, from the dazzling colours in the majestic &lt;i&gt;Colonel Alastair Ranaldson Macdonell of Glengarry&lt;/i&gt; (ex. 1812; Edinburgh, NGS) to the intimate, yet carefully executed portrait of the engineer &lt;i&gt;John Rennie&lt;/i&gt; (c. 1810; Edinburgh, NGS).\n\nIn 1815 Raeburn was elected a member of Royal Academy in London. His inaugural piece, a &lt;i&gt;Self-portrait&lt;/i&gt; (Edinburgh, NGS) shows his ambition to impress a London audience. However, Raeburn never managed to conquer the artistic scene of the capital and the rest of his career evolved around Edinburgh. He was knighted in 1822 by George IV, which marked the height of his achievement.\n\nThis painting represents William Hobson of Markfield (1752-1840), a successful building contractor. Mr Hobson was involved in the rebuilding of St Luke\u2019s hospital, and the Docklands of London, however he is probably best known for the construction of the Martello Towers. The Martello towers were built along the South East coast of Britain in defence against the threat of French invasion during the Napoleonic wars. William Hobson resided in his house, Markfield, in what was then the village of Tottenham, near London. In 1806, the artist John Constable came to visit Markfield with a view of teaching Hobson\u2019s thirteen daughters drawing. This resulted in a series of portraits of the Hobson family being made by Constable. \n\nJudging from the apparent age of the sitter and the style, the work was probably executed in Raeburn\u2019s last years. The gentleman is shown at a desk, in three-quarter length, seated with legs apart.  He looks slightly to the right, avoiding the direct gaze at the viewer.\n\nRaeburn painted some of the areas, such as the sitter\u2019s face and front of his coat, in very fine detail. In other passages he shows a dynamic sketchiness of brushwork, for which he was renowned. The V&amp;A also has a portrait of the wife of William Hobson, nee Ann Rickman, whom he married in 1779 (inventory number P.8-1921). Both were probably executed in a similar time and came to the museum in the same bequest.",
