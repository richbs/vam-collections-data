Each pair of leaves is secured by finger hingers.\nEach leaf is formed from two uprights and three crosspieces froming two recessed panels. There is an apron carved in openwork below the bottom crosspiece. All the woodwork is lacquered black.\nThe recessed panels are decorated with  carved applique work in woods, ivory, various hardstones and coral. The smaller lower panels show fruiting shrubs, while the upper ones show flowers in vases on stands with emblems of good luck. The four central panels show flowers of the seasons. Each panel carries a four character 'caoshu' inscription in ivory applique.\nThe reverses of the six leaves form a continuous scene of Taoist and Buddhist divinities in a landscape dotted with buildings, executed in polychrome painted lacquer.",
