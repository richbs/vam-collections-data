His work is regarded as some of the finest in the Art Deco style, which became popular in America, Europe and beyond between about 1910 and 1939.  Ruhlmann was famed for his exquisitely crafted furniture and interiors where he often employed exotic and expensive materials.  The use of macassar ebony to veneer this table's surfaces would have ensured that it was affordable only to the wealthiest buyer.  The designer called his more richly crafted creations his 'precious pieces'.  We do not know if this table was one of these but the elegant lines and expensive materials are  typical of Ruhlmann's work.  The designer himself never received any formal training in cabinet-making, but he collaborated closely with the craftsmen that he recruited to ensure that his designs were carried out to the highest possible standard.",
