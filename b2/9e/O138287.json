It reflected a 'B-Boy' style of dress worn by young British men around 1988.\n\nIn the late 1980s the black militant look was epitomised by the band Public Enemy. On their first LP, 'Yo! Bum rush the show', released in 1987, they were dressed in army camouflage, black berets and held Uzis. This look became popular as an expression of black consciousness.
