The company has collected an archive containing many historical textiles and pattern books to provide its designers with inspiration. This textile design was inspired by objects in the V&A collections, and was donated to the Museum along with other furnishing fabrics in 1928. Its motifs reveal a fascination with Greek Island embroidery, of which the Museum has one of the best collections in the world.\n\nBy the 1920s, when this sample was made, avant-garde textile designers in Britain were particularly interested in severe, sparsely coloured, abstract and geometric designs. Although Bakers did not embrace the extremes of this style, the company did bring out an experimental range of purely geometric patterns.",
