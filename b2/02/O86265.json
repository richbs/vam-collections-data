It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke and compiled in a series of albums.\n\nWalton & Lester were the comedy duo billed as \u2018The World\u2019s Worst Wizards\u2019 or \u2018The World\u2019s Worst Hypnotists\u2019. At Stoke-on-Trent they made their entrance on a houseboat in smart clothes and sang the song \u2018Down by the River\u2019. A reviewer noted, \u2018Their muddled magic, and their comments thereon, are absolutely side-splitting ... their cannon-and-trunk trick is enough to tickle the most morose\u2019.\n\nMagic and hypnotism were two popular acts on the music hall stage. It gave their act a new twist to be deliberately bad at both, wearing comic costume and hairstyles. A later and more famous incompetent comic magician in this tradition was Tommy Cooper.",

Magic and hypnotism were two popular acts on the music hall stage, and it gave their act a new twist to be deliberately bad at both. A later and more famous incompetent comic magician in this tradition was Tommy Cooper (1922-1984). The caricature comes from the second album of caricatures in a collection of albums owned by the Theatre Museum compiled by the graphic artist George Cooke.  It is labelled by the artist 'Geo Cooke HYS BOOKE' and features music hall performers working in the early 20th century.",
