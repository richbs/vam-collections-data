The sculptor is unknown, however it is likely he would have been either from Rome or Naples.",

They had been found a few years previously, placed with their carved surfaces downwards, forming some of the pavement of the Jesuit's church in Naples.\n\nHistorical significance: St Peter is the leader of the Apostles. He is depicted here with his usual attributes of the key to the Kingdom of Heaven, and the gospel. \n\nThe saints represented at the top of the Gateway of the Castelnuovo in Naples are shown within very similar niches, with the semi-circular shell-like carving behind each head, and this seems to be a frequently used motif at this time. The prophets in the circular medallions above are a common motif in Naples and can be seen in the Placido di Sangro monument in San Domenico in Naples (1480).\n\nRobinson and McLagan & Longhurst ascribed the works to a Florentine artist working in Naples, however Pope-Hennessy instead ascribes the work to a native Neapolitan influenced by Mino del Reame and Paolo Romano, or alternatively the work of a Roman sculptor working in Naples.",

            "historical_context_note": "This relief is believed to have formed part of a pentaptych, and may have once have adjoined the (proper) right side of 7390-1861, the (proper) left side of which would have adjoined the central panel. The pilaster on the (proper) left of 7390-1861 is different from the other three pilasters, which suggests it could have once adjoined the central panel. St Peter is usually depicted in the prime position at the right hand of Christ, however because of the missing edges to both these pieces it is difficult to be definite about their original form.\n\nThe Jesuits had two churches in Naples before their expulsion in 1767: Gesu Vecchio, founded in 1557 on the site of a place belonging to the Conti di Maddaloni and of the old church of Santi Giovanni e Paolo; and Gesu Nuovo, founded in 1584 on the site of a palace constructed in 1470 by Novello da San Lucano for Roberto Sanseverino, Prince of Salerno. After the Jesuits expulsion the Gesu Vecchio passed from their control permanently. However, after the return of order to the city, the Gesu Nuovo remained the Jesuits headquarters until they were expelled again in 1860. It is therefore likely that, as these two pieces were bought in 1860, that they originated from the Gesu Nuovo.",
