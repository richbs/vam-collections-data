Apprenticed to a publisher 1808, received a few lessons in painting from Thomas Sully. A subscription was raised to enable him to study art in Europe; returned.to London 1811, entered RA Schools and studied with Benjamin West and Washington Allston. Visited Paris 1817 with Allston and Wilkie Collins, met G S Newton, with whom he visited Brussels and Antwerp. Also friend and biographer (published 1843) of John Constable. Exhibited 76 works at the RA between 1813 and 1859, and 11 at the BI 1815-32. Some were portraits, but most were his much admired literary subjects, particularly drawn from Cervantes, Moliere, Shakespeare and Steme. Elected ARA 1821, RA 1826. Several of his works were engraved, and he made six illustrations for Sir Walter Scott's Waverley novels 1824. Worked for six months as drawing master at West Point Military Academy, New York State, 1833. Professor of Painting at RA 1848-52; his lectures were published as a <U>Handbook for Young Painters</u> (1855). His <u>Life of Reynolds</u> was finished by Tom Taylor and published 1865. Died St John's Wood, London, 5 May 1859. An exhibition at the RA of  30 of his works was held winter 1870. His two sons, George Dunlop and Robert, were also artists. The <u>Athenaeum </u>critic (9 May 1846, p480) wrote that he was 'unrivalled for the certainty of his powers, the <i>wit</i> of his pencil, the deep knowledge of human nature as exhibited in the more ordinary scenes of life'.\n\nLIT: <u>Art JournaI</u>1856, pp73-5 and 105-7, 1859, p187 (obit); C R Leslie <u>Autobiographical Recollections</u> ed T Taylor, 2 vols, 1860; J Dafforne <u>Pictures by C R Leslie </u> nd [1875]; <u>Art ]ournaI</u>1902, pp 144-8; J Constable <u>The Letters of John Constable and C R Leslie</u> 1931; ed R B Beckett John <u>Constable's Correspondence</u> III, Ipswich 1965 \n\n<b>Dulcinea del Toboso</b>\n\nFA131 Neg 59129 \nPanel, 30.5 X 25.4 cm (12 X 10 ins) \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nExhibited at the RA in 1839, and, according to<u> Leslie</u> (II, p251), painted for John Sheepshanks. The subject is taken from Cervantes's <i>Don Quixote</i>: \n\nNear the place where he lived, there dwelt a very comely country lass with whom he had formerly been in love; though, as it was supposed, she never knew it nor troubled herself about it. Her name was Aldonzo Lorenzo, and her he pitched upon to be the lady of his thoughts: then casting about for a name, which should incline towards that of a great lady or princess, he resolved to call her Dulcinea del Toboso (part 1 chapter 1). \nThe <u>Athenaeum</u> critic noted that Leslie shows the woman \n\nNot as the goddess of the Den's magnificent fantasy, but in he real guise as thel girl who rode to mass or market on 'her pied belfry' arranging her hair, not to tempt bold knights to gentle deeds, but to isure the more equal and substantial wooing of the chosen Gil or Juan. We are sorry to observe, that Mr Leslie's scarlet fancy in flesh-colouring \nis rather on the increase: - let him carry it a little further, and the critic must needs talk of the geraniums, not the roses, on the cheeks of his maidens. \n\nOther critics seem to have misunderstood Leslie's intentions. The <u>Art Union</u> pronounced tersely that 'This is a misnomer. It is not a portrait of the innamorato of Don Quixote; although a very carefully painted picture of a buxom country wench'. The <u>Examiner</u> described it as: \nA picture which strikingly exemplifies the disadvantages of a misnomer. It is utterly devoid of the charm of verisimilitude; and, consequently, its appeal to our applause is solely dependent upon its execution, which is sufficiently meretorious. The appearance of this good-looking female as much embodies our ideas of the coarse, garlic-eating peasant as it does those of Teresa or Sanchica Panza. The fact is, that such a subject should never have been selected but as a part of a composition; for a solitary treatment of it, if vraisemblable, could never by any art have been rendered attractive'. \nThe study of a female head, FA12l, p169 is possibly the same figure seen from the back. What appears to be a second version of the subject was in the J C Grundy sale at Christie's 4 November 1867, bought Agnew \u00a3107 2s. \n\nEXH: RA 1839 (144) \n\nLIT: <u>Athenaeum</u> 25 May 1839, p396; <u>The Examiner</u> 1839, p359; <u>Art Union</u> 1839, p68; <u>Leslie</u> I, pxli, II, p251; <u>Bibby's Annual</u> 1909, p32 (repr}; <u>The Bazaar</u> 28 September 1929, (repr) \n\nENGR: Anon (irnpr in V&A collections, 18747, also from the Sheepshanks Gift) \n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
