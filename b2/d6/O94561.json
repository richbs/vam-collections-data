Some had an external jacket, filled with hot water, that enclosed an inner gravy reservoir. Others had a hot iron placed in an internal socket, like a tea-urn. Argyles were most popular between 1765 and 1800 and were made in silver, Sheffield plate, porcelain and earthenware. They were one of a number of specialised articles which evolved because of an increasing preoccupation with refined and elegant dining.\n\nArchibald Campbell, 3rd Duke of Argyll, is generally credited with inventing the argyle. He commissioned the silversmith Fuller White to make him one in 1755.",
