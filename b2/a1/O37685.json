One of the  boys at the school, Jim Jarvis, showed him the problem of homeless children sleeping rough in the area, and in 1870 Barnardo set up a home in Stepney for destitute boys.  When a boy who had been turned away (because the home was full) was found dead of starvation and exposure, the home adopted the motto 'No Destitute Child Ever Refused Admission' and Barnardo redoubled his efforts to help the poorest and most vulnerable children by establishing similar homes across the UK.",
