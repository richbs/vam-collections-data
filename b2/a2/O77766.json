The passion for China and things Chinese led to tea becoming a fashionable and popular drink despite its high cost. Dinner at that time was served around 3 or 4 in the afternoon, after which tea or coffee were often taken. It was made at the tea table by the lady of the house with an elegant silver or porcelain tea service. Tea kettles became popular at the beginning of the 18th century. They have a small spirit lamp in the base to keep the water hot for topping up the teapot.\n\nPeople\nThis kettle and stand were made by William Grundy, who was apprenticed as a silversmith in 1731 and probably died before 1780. The engraved coat of arms belongs to the Stacye family.\n\nDesign & Designing\nUntil the 1730s, kettles were plain and undecorated, but the influence of Rococo taste transformed the vessel into a vehicle for extravagant ornament. This kettle is chased with Rococo scrollwork and floral motifs, and its domed lid is surmounted by a fancy finial in the shape of a bunch of grapes, a popular feature in the 1750s. The tea kettle and stand would have been the most expensive part of the tea service. For example, Mrs Coke paid the goldsmith George Wickes (1698-1761) \u00a325 13s 1d for her kettle and lamp. Her teapot cost just \u00a310 1s 8d.",
