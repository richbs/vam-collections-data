Most of the surviving pieces were made in commercial workshops but it was also made by amateurs.  Some pieces were undoubtedly made by French prisoners of war in England, but not as many as is often claimed.  The straw (some dyed different colours) was split and flattened, then glued onto sheets of paper, on which the design had been drawn.  Boxes like this one were often given as presents to a loved one, and the motifs may reflect this.  On this box, the motifs include different flowers and the quivers and arrows that were emblems of Cupid, the god of Love.  Each flower might have a different meaning.  A rose could represent a vow of love if it were pink, and passionate love if it were red, while pansies were emblems of thought, a play on the French word pens\u00e9e(thought). The design on this box is ambitious but the drawing is a little awkward.  This may indicate that it was made by an amateur, but we have no certain evidence for its origin.",
