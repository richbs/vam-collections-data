The design for this particular corkscrew was registered by Robert Jones & Son, Cheapside, Birmingham, on 7 October 1842.\n\nManufacturer\nMany of the more sophisticated corkscrews were made by Birmingham manufacturers.  Dixs' Directory of Birmingham, dating from 1858, lists 16 corkscrew manufacturers (including Robert Jones & Son), all of which were substantial firms.  This corkscrew is stamped with the design registry mark for October 7th 1842 VR and ROBERT JONES BIRMINGHAM REGISTERED.  It is an example of the rare second patent.\n\nMaterials & Use\nThe turned wooden handle would originally have been fitted with a brush, used to clean off the dirt and dust from an ancient bottle of wine.  Characteristic of Jones' patent corkscrews are the two steel spikes protruding through the washer inside the brass case.  These hold the cork steady as it is withdrawn from the bottle.  As with all the Robert Jones' patents, the brass case decorated with mouldings and the plain steel 'worm' are very well finished and precisely cut.",
