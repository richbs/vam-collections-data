According to the aquatint, Pr\u00e9aulx based his watercolour on a sketch by F.B. Spilsbury, then in the collection of John Spencer Smith, to whom the print was dedicated. Spencer Smith was the Levant Company's Charg\u00e9 d'affaires, 1795-9, when Lord Elgin was appointed Ambassador; he remained as secretary to the Embassy until his resignation in 1801: see A.C. Wood, A History of the Levant Company, 1964, pp.182-3.  He commissioned several other drawings from Pr\u00e9aulx, also reproduced as aquatints by Jeakes and published by E. Orme (see SP.474 & SP.475).  He was the younger brother of Sir Sidney Smith (1764-1840)  who, in 1799, in command of the Tigre, successfully defended Acre and repulsed Napoleon: see DNB.
