A hot soldering iron was applied to the surface, melting the tin under the silver foil and fusing the silver to the steel. Bubbles of rust on the underlying tin have caused the plating to lift. On exposure to the air, the tin has tarnished black.\n\nManufacturing close plate was laborious and time-consuming, but the industry did not collide directly with electroplate in the same way as Sheffield plate.
