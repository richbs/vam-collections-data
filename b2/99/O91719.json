From paintings of the time we know that tazzas were used to hold fruits and sweetmeats, but this example may have been made purely for display. \n\nThe scene in the centre depicts the mythological story of Diana and Actaeon from the Metamorphoses by the Roman poet Ovid. Actaeon is a hunter who unwittingly stumbles across the chaste goddess Diana while she is bathing. As punishment for seeing her naked, Diana turns Actaeon into a stag and he is killed by his own hunting dogs. The scene here shows the moment of Actaeon's transformation, with antlers sprouting from his head.",
