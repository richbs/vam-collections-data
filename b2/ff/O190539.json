Roger Eno. Des: Russell Mills (b.1952) and Dave Coppenhall. (The original cement, acrylic and collage paintings by Mills: c.c.60 x 60). Photo: Jeff Veitch. Offset lithography. Land Records. 1988. E.1590-1990. Stickers: 8.6 x 12.0. E.1590 (1), (2), (3)-1990. Disc diameter: 12. Case opens to: 12.4 x 27.5. E.1610 to 1611-1990. The painting emerged after many discussions with Roger Eno. Mills, (appointed art director/consultant of Land records in 1988), became so involved in the music that he even selected the titles for a majority of the compositions. The painting explores the confluence of nature, science and religion.'",
