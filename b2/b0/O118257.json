            "public_access_description": "This figurine was produced by the Samson factory in Paris which was established in 1845 by Edm\u00e9 Samson, a famous copyist of pottery and porcelain. He produced pieces inspired by and copied from the work of famous factories including Chinese export porcelain, Meissen, S\u00e8vres, Chelsea, Derby and all the major factories of England, France and Germany, as well as tin-glazed earthenware or faience. \n\nThis probably represents a character from the Commedia dell'Arte, or 'artistic comedy', the popular improvised knockabout comedy which flourished in Italy from the 16th to the 18th centuries and influenced theatre throughout Europe, especially France. Commedia plays were acted along pre-arranged scenarios but relied on the performers' ability for improvisation and ensured their popularity with a mixture of knockabout comedy, acrobatic leaping and romantic interest. Various visiting Italian troupes performed in France in the 16th century where their type of theatre was called the Com\u00e9die-Italienne. By the 17th century however their plays were being performed largely in French, and by the 18th century Commedia dell'Arte was a recognised part of the French theatre.",
