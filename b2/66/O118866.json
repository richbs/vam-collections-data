The 19th century saw a craze for ceramic figurines of performers and Agatha Walker attempted to revive this tradition with her limited edition sculptures, modelled from life in plaster and coated with a fine layer of wax which was then coloured.  In 1931 Agatha Walker's wax figures were exhibited at the Fine Art Society.\n\nThis represents the actress and singer Sylvia Nelis as Polly Peachum in John Gay's The Beggar's Opera which opened at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith on 5 June 1920. It was one of a set of characters from the opera produced by Agatha Walker in 1921. This revival of the18th century operetta ran for three years and was a great success for the theatre's owner Sir Nigel Playfair who purchased the lease of the derelict theatre building in 1918 in a syndicateand transformed it into a highly successful venue, putting Hammersmith firmly on the theatrical map.",
