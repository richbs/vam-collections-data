            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nThis candelabrum is one of a set of ten, made for the Conservatory at Carlton House, and were commissioned for the Prince Regent. The candelabra originally had black marble plinths, and held brass lamps with six burners each. Also in the Conservatory were Coadestone statues of kings, bishops and a pilgrim, and a central fountain with eight dragons spouting water into a basin. When Carlton House was demolished in 1827, the candelabra were installed in the Coffee Room at Windsor Castle.\n\nThe animal forms and fantastic dragons, along with the medieval Perpendicular style architectural details, are typical of the Gothic Revival.\n\nPeople\nThe candelabra were designed by Thomas Hopper (1776-1856). Hopper was an architect and designer, who built up an extensive country house practice. He famously said 'it is an architect's business to understand all styles, and to be prejudiced in favour of none'. The present piece in the revived Gothic taste was for a Conservatory constructed en suite with Carlton House's dining room.\n\nMaterials & Techniques\nThe candelabra were made of Coadestone, a ceramic-type material manufactured by Eleanor Coade (1733-1821), whose family business in London's Lambeth district ran from 1769 to 1833. In 1810 it was trading under the name 'Coade & Sealey'. Coadestone was durable and could be used for outdoor sculpture and architectural ornament with less risk of weathering than natural stone. It was also cast from moulds, and so could be used to reproduce forms. Here, the form of the candelabrum was repeated for the whole set, and the crisp definition of its shape and details show how the surface has remained intact and in good condition.",
