The wallpaper designs are named after various architectural schemes by Le Corbusier. The patterns themselves are characterised by subtle geometric or abstract forms. The papers are designed to be hung in a grid format, hence the title of the collection. They are made of TNT, a non-woven fabric of cellulose and polyester, designed for durability and resistance to damp. The collection offers an interesting instance of a contemporary wallpaper designer using historical precedents in the applied arts as a source of inspiration and combining this with new wallpaper production technology, and the innovative application of the designs in the home, as well as workplaces and public buildings. The pattern book interleaves samples of the papers themselves with photographs of the papers hung in domestic room sets and in commercial settings \u2013 the text especially recommends these papers for otherwise \u2018neutral\u2019 waiting rooms and \u2018anonymous\u2019 public spaces and \u2018non-locations\u2019 such as hotels.",
