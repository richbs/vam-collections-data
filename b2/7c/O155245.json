The gateway has two square upright pillars with three architraves, all of which are elaborately carved in relief with scenes from the Buddha's life and stories from the Buddha's previous existences (jatakas). The bottom architrave shows King Asoka and his royal entourage venerating the bodhi tree. The middle architrave illustrates the story of the Great Departure of the Buddha. The topmost architrave shows various standing figures venerating stupas and bodhi trees together with images of people riding bulls. \n\nThe end of each architrave is carved with a scroll design, with standing elephants on top. A wheel surmounted by a trident shape (triratna) is seen on the topmost architrave above the right hand pillar. The square upright pillars are carved with framed scenes, such as the miracle of walking on the waters (left pillar, second frame from the bottom) and the veneration of a bodhi tree (left pillar, third frame from the bottom). Caparisoned elephants encircle the pillars just below the lowest architrave and between the pillars and the architrave a female nature spirit (yakshi) leans out, holding onto the branch of a mango tree. A smaller yakshi appears between the top and middle architraves. The brick stupa, covered with vegetation, appears behind the gateway surrounded by a stone railing (vedika). There is a person standing in the foreground to the right of the gateway which gives a sense of scale.",

            "history_note": "This photograph was initially part of the photographic collection held in the National Art Library. Markings on the top of the mount indicate the way in which the object was categorised.\nThe mount is buff-coloured and has a label on the reverse side giving a description of the object photographed, along with its dimensions.\n\nHistorical significance: The hilltop site of Sanchi comprises the remains of stupas, temples and monastic buildings. Abandoned from the 14th century, Sanchi was 'rediscovered' by a British officer, General Taylor, in 1818. However, it was not until 1881 that restoration work was initiated. Between 1912 and 1919 the structures were restored to their present condition under the supervision of Sir John Marshall, Director General of Archaeology in India.\n\nThe Great Stupa (known as Stupa 1) at Sanchi is the most important and complete surviving monument of the Shunga era (circa 185-175 BCE). The original mound was a brick structure built by King Asoka during the 3rd century BCE. During the late 1st century BCE it was enlarged to twice its original size, the dome was encased in sandstone slabs and a walkway was constructed on the ground level and marked with a stone railing (vedika). A square structure (harmika) was constructed on top of the mound which contained a three tiered umbrella (chattravali), representing the three jewels of Buddhism - the Buddha, the dharma (ethical precepts of Buddhism) and the sangha (community of Buddhist monks). Four stone gateways (toranas) were built around the stupa, one in each cardinal direction. Each gateway comprises two upright stone pillars with three architraves, elaborately carved in relief with scenes from the Buddha's life and stories from his previous existences (jatakas).\n\nThe stupa form developed out of hemispherical funerary mounds, the earliest being used to enshrine the remains of the Buddha himself. Over time, stupas came to commemorate the Buddha's spiritual achievement, his enlightenment and teachings. Smaller stupas were built as votive objects at Buddhist holy sites, often clustered around larger stupas.",
