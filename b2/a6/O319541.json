It consisted of shaped piece of fabric, usually triangular, which filled in the gap between the fronts of a woman\u2019s open gown.  Stomachers were often richly embellished to contrast with the fabrics and decoration of the gown.  \n\nThis stomacher is embroidered in a technique known as blackwork,  worked with a single colour of silk, usually black, but also blue, red or green, on linen. Blackwork was particularly popular for dress accessories such as handkerchiefs, coifs, caps, shirts and smocks. \n\nThe pattern reflects the strapwork designs of the 16th century.  The simple speckling may be a transition from the repeating geometrical stitches of the 16th century to the subtle speckling stitch of the 17th century, imitating the shading of woodblock prints.  The shape of the stomacher corresponds with the long, pointed waistline fashionable during the period 1590 to 1610.",
