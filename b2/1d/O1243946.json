Elizabeth was one of six children and these dresses were hand-me-downs to here from one of her sisters. The dresses were worn for weekly Mass and for other special occasions and Elizabeth recalls that she felt quite formal and uncomfortable wearing them despite her mother\u2019s fondness for how adorable they made her look.",

My father was an orthopaedic surgeon at the Royal Sussex Hospital in Hastings and my mother did not work outside the house. Sunday we would go to Mass and we were expected to wear our best clothes. I was about 4 when I wore these dresses, young enough to still need help (from an au pair) getting dressed. I would wear them to church or parties and I remember being uncomfortable in them, not because they were hand-me downs from my sister - I was indifferent to that - but because I felt so self conscious in them. My mother would gush about how adorable I looked and wearing them meant that I had to behave in a straightened way. Being the child in the dress made me feel as if this was my mother's preferred version of me and whilst i wanted her smile it did not feel natural to me.'",
