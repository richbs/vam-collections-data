He was married to Sarah, who was unable to conceive a child. One day on the plains of Mamre, Abraham and Sarah were visited by three strangers. Abraham offered them food and drink, as was customary in the Jewish faith. They revealed themselves as angels and said that they brought a message from God that Sarah would become pregnant. She did, and in time gave birth to Isaac. In medieval art the three angels were interpreted as a symbol of the Trinity. Their announcement was viewed as a prefigurement of the Annunciation of the archangel Gabriel to the Virgin Mary.",
