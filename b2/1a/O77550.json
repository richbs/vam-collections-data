With its combination of classical foliate motifs, and its elegant classical shape (it is based on an ancient Roman funerary urn), it was likely to appeal to European visitors to Rome, particularly the British. Several other versions are known. An engraving of the vase appeared in volume II of Piranesi's Vasi, Candelabri ... ' of 1778.\n\nPeople\nGiovanni Battista Piranesi (1720-1778) is most renowned as an etcher and engraver, and his series of etchings of real and  imaginary architectural settings were a great influence on artists and patrons of the mid-18th century. His interpretations of ancient Roman art inspired writers and artists alike.\n\nTime\nDuring the18th century many aristocratic visitors went to Rome; for the British, this was part of the Grand Tour, often the completion of a young gentleman's education. Many Italian artists, as well as artists from other European countries, especially Britain, worked in Rome, and their workshops were much visited by patrons. The ancient remains of Rome, such as the Colosseum and the Forum were explored by connoisseurs and tourists, and excavated sculptures were displayed and often sold to foreign visitors. In addition many artists, such as Piranesi, made pastiche ancient objects, while other sculptors heavily restored fragments of ancient sculpture, which were then sold as authentic antique pieces.",
