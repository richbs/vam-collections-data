It is part of the classical architectural tradition that was revived during the Italian Renaissance. Decorative friezes were a novelty in early 16th-century England, when visiting Italian artists first began to influence native design. This and other terracotta architectural fragments were found in 1937 during excavations in Southwark, south London, on the site of Suffolk Place, Mint Street, in The Borough. The site was once the imposing home of Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk (died 1545), brother-in-law to King Henry VIII. It was built between 1518 and 1522. In about 1540 the King acquired Suffolk Place in order to set up a mint to make and stamp new coins of the realm. Later, his daughter, Queen Mary I, gave the property to Nicholas Heath, Archbishop of York, who sold it in 1557, following which it was mostly pulled down and the area redeveloped.",
