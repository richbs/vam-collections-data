Among his most experimental works are what he called his \u2018blacks\u2019, the intensely atmospheric, tonal brush drawings made during the time he lived in Shoreham in Kent, a place he regarded as his \u2018valley of vision\u2019. He began to make the \u2018blacks\u2019 to explore ways of representing the mysterious nocturnal landscape, and the effect of moonlight reflecting on clouds and shining through trees.",
