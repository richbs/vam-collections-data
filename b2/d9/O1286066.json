Liverpool was well-served for London productions that year, and the following week's production was a post-London tour of Cocteau's intellectual Ruritanian melodrama The Eagle Has Two Heads from the Theatre Royal Haymarket starring Eileen Herlie (1918-2008). She made her career overnight as the Queen when the play was first produced at the Lyric Theatre Hammersmith in 1946 performing the sensational 21 minute speech by candlelight which was thought at the time to be the longest speech in the history of the stage.\n\nThe poster, hanging card and programme were kept by the actor Richard Bebb (1927-2006) as a souvenir of his professional debut in the production as one of the Watchmen at Dunsinane. He is credited here with his original name Richard Bebb Williams, which he later changed, using his mother's name Bebb as his surname since there was another actor at the time called Richard Williams.",
