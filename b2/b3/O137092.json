The originality and flair of the piece lies in the contrast between the starkly simple form and the bold Art Deco lettering. The cleverly designed pierced inscription can be read from either side. The pierced finial balances the shape of the trowel creating a comfortable aesthetic. Further contrast lies in the utilitarian connotations of the spanner contradicting the Art Deco allusions to opulence and luxury.",
