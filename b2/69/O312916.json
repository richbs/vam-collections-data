The eyelids of the Virgin and Christ are carved. Traces of green paint and the usual daisy pattern remain on the ground on the left and right of the carving. There are traces of red on the inside of the Virgin's cloak and a brownish colour on her hair. There is some green paint on Christ's torse. The back of the figure has been hollowed away to lessen the weight.",
