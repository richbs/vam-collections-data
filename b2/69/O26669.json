Any number above two can play.\n2.  Each player receives 10 counters with which to buy cards.\n3.  One of the players being chosen dealer, shuffles the cards and deals all of them round, face downwards.\n4.  The players then examine their cards and take out any pairs they may have, placing them face downwards on the table before them.\n5.  The player on the left of the dealer then offers for sale any card he cannot pair and therefore does not want; this he does by reading aloud the descriptions at the top of the name of the article, speaking thus \"I have something to sell\", and then describing it and asks for bids; he then sells  the cards to the highest bidder who pays he the counters; should it make a pair for the buyer, he places it before him on the table with his other pairs, if he has any; should it not pair he puts it with his other cards for future use.\n6.  The player on the left of the last seller next offers a card he does not want in the same way, and the game goes round until all the cards are paired when the player having most pairs wins the game.\n7.  If a seller does not wish to accept the highiest bid offered, he may buy it in by paying to the pool a higher bid.\n8.  No one is allowed to buy who is sold out of cards.\n9.  If at the end of the game more than one holds an equally high number of pairs then the one who has most counters as well as most pairs wins.\n10.  Cards are not allowed to be changed during selling.\n\nNOTE - If the dealer finds at the beginning of a game in dealing out the last round of cards that there are not sufficient to supply all with an even number, then the odd cards are sold by the dealer one at a time without being seen or described to the highest bidders.  The counters paid for them are put in the pool.\n\nSECOND WAY OF PLAYINg.\nProceed as in the first way but deal 15 counters instead of 10 to each person.  The players each pay one counter to the pool every time they sell a card.  The winner of the game takes the contents of the pool.",
