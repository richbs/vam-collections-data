This baluster-shaped vase and lid, and the rich 'flamb\u00e9', or more accurately, 'flamm\u00e9e' glaze, was made for the collectors' market. It was made to take pride of place in an exquisite home, where it would be marvelled at, and lovingly stroked by its appreciative and much-envied owner.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe Ruskin Pottery specialised, to a degree unmatched by its contemporaries, in a porcellaneous stoneware so finely thrown that its thinness rivals some true porcelains, and in what are known as transmutation glazes and reduction firing.  Based on mineral (usually iron or copper) oxides, these glazes are fired at high temperatures (at up to 1600\u00ba C in the case of the Ruskin Pottery) and as the glaze melts, the oxygen is reduced, or replaced with carbon monoxide by, for instance the introduction of wet wood.  This results in a violent reaction within the glaze, which is transmuted into an unpredictable range of reds, purples, blues, lilacs and greens.",
