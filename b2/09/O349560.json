This terracotta is one of several contemporary workshop casts taken from a marble version by Tacca.\nIt represents Cosimo II de' Medici (1590-1621), who was the son of Ferdinando I de' Medici. He was the Grand Duke of Tuscany from 1609-1621. He married Maria Maddalena and had eight children with her. From 1605-1608 he received his education from Galileo Galilei.\n\nThe Medici were a powerful and influential Florentine family, with great influence in Florence from the 14th to the 18th century. There were three Popes among the family and many rulers of Florence, like of example Lorenzo de'Medici or Lorenzo the Magnificent (1449-1492), who was patron of some of the most important artists of the Renaissance.",
