His passion for reviving Gothic forms is apparent in the headdresses of the people on the chess board, the patterns for the tiles, and the decoration of the borders.  The inscriptions of 'Ou bien Faize' (Or well done) and 'Ou bien dize' (Or well said) are in an old form of French. \n\nThe frame with its brass label is later and is inscribed 'Bristol & Clifton Chess Assocn first prize won by J. Burt, 1872'.  John Burt was vice-president of The Bristol and Clifton Chess Association which was originally known as The Bristol Chess Club.  This design raises the question whether Pugin's drawing was commissioned in and around 1830 to mark the foundation in 1829 or 1830 of The Bristol Chess Club.",
