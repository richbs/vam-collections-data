The pin is joined to the clasp by three graduated chains of figure-of-eight links, which hang across the front of the clasp, from a ring at the top of the right-hand piece, when the pin is in place.  The filigree is decorated with applied domes covered with a granulated design like a stylised pomegranate, and rosettes of facetted lozenges, with a six-pointed Star of David surrounding the central rosette.  There are vertical bars on the back to attach the clasp to a belt.  The bars on the back all have heavy zigzag chisel marks, to show that they have been tested as silver.  The pin may be silver-plated.",

These clasps come in a small number of basic shapes.  This one is shaped like stylised tulips, a favourite Ottoman motif.  It was worn with the pointed part facing upwards, and was fastened by a pin, which attached the left-hand piece to the rest of the clasp.  The three chains, which join the pin to the clasp, hung down decoratively over the front of the clasp when it was fastened.  \n\nCypriot clasps are part of the general Ottoman tradition, but are often more sophisticated and decorative than those from elsewhere.  The design of this clasp is a pattern found mainly on Cyprus, although similar tulip-shaped filigree clasps were also made elsewhere, particularly in the former Yugoslavia and Armenia.  The goldsmiths of Cyprus were famous for their filigree, although they rarely marked their work.  This clasp is a rare exception, and may have been made outside the island, as it is marked three times with the tughra, which was the official silver mark of the Ottoman Empire.  \n\nThis clasp was described as 18th century when it was acquired, and the tughra mark confirms that it was made between 1730 and 1754.  It was bought in 1888, just after a terrible famine, when many people had to sell their family heirlooms to survive.",
