This was a type of photomechanical reproduction using pigmented gelatin, usually of a rich purple-brown colour. The process was complicated but remained popular until about 1900 because of the high quality and permanence of the finished images.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nMuch second-hand furniture was originally the entire contents of a poor household, bought together for a given sum. The items were then repaired, repainted or varnished for sale. Second-hand furniture dealers in the 19th century were used to scenes of misery:  their stock often came from owners who were desperate for money and had to sell their basic possessions to survive.\n\nReal or Posed?\nThe people in the pictures were arranged or posed by Thomson to form interesting compositions. However, the results were often naturalistic because the subjects and surroundings were always authentic.",
