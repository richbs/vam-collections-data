Her work addresses issues of identity and the relationship between public and private space. References to domesticity are often made through the use of wallpaper. \n\nIn this piece Boyce uses blind embossing \u2013 stamping an impression into the paper, leaving raised areas \u2013 to create the image, which is the text of a popular song, \u2018Hurt So Good\u2019 (1975) by Susan Cadogan. Boyce intends the paper to evoke the experience of West Indian house parties, where couples dance together, leaving the wallpaper faintly marked where they press against it. These marks she sees as evidence of their physical and emotional engagement with the place and the music, and of the intensity of love itself, sensual but sometimes painful.",
