            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nThe top of the chest is hinged and retains its original mahogany supporting arm. The front opens to reveal two drawers, with their original handles. The chest has been used extensively, probably to store clothes in a bedroom or dressing room. In August 1740, Lady Elizabeth Smithson described a 'large Mahogany Chest lind with Green Bays for My Cloathes', standing on one side of her bedchamber at Stanwick, Yorkshire.\n\nMaterials & Design\nThe carcase of the chest is pine. It is veneered on the lid, front and sides with high quality mahogany and the carved elements are in solid mahogany. The five pedestals support the heads of putti and are carved with acanthus foliage and an overlapping guilloche pattern. They are rest on plinths carved with paterae. Between the plinths there are carved C-scroll brackets, their spandrels carved with a diaper pattern. Above the pedestals is a shallow frieze with a floral Greek key pattern.\n\nPeople\nIn the early 1740s, Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 4th Earl of Shaftesbury, commissioned the architect Henry Flitcroft to recreate the interiors at St Giles's House, Wimborne, Dorset. The house had been built in the 1650s and Flitcroft redesigned the state dining room, the Tapestry Room and the White Hall. A visitor in 1754 noted that they were 'finished in a very elegant manner'. Flitcroft was also involved with the decoration of Lord Shaftesbury's London house in Grosvenor Square. This handsome chest may have been supplied for use in London or at St Giles's.",
