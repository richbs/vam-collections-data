Studied with J V Barber from the age of 11 (according to a note in the Department's MS Register). Moved to London 1824 and studied with the landscape engraver Edward Goodall for a year. Principally known as an engraver, etcher, lithographer and watercolourist, he also exhibited three oils at the RA between 1838 and 1852, 21 works, mainly landscapes, at the BI 1835-58, and 32 at the SBA 1831-47. He engraved plates for many books, including J M W Turner's Annual Tour of 1833 and 1834; two of his engravings after paintings by Turner were exhibited at the 1862 International Exhibition. A volume of his prints after his own work was published 1844. This volume, many other prints and four watercolours, are in the V&A collections.
