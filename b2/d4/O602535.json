They were engraved by George-Jacques Gatine after drawings by Horace Vernet and Louis-Marie Lant\u00e9. Whilst most fashion plates were on a small scale, designed to fit in women's magazines such as the Journal des Dames (which Gatine contributed to), the Incroyable et Merveilleuse plates were on a grander scale, designed for print collectors. Gatine's fashion engravings, particularly the Incroyable et Merveilleuse series, are now considered some of the finest records of French fashion of this period.\n\nThe Incroyable et Merveilleuse plates are particularly valuable as a record of men's fashion. This is a back view of a man in a green coat wearing striped trousers with flat pumps with bows, a malacca cane and carrying a black hat with a boat-shaped brim. His haircut is described as in the style of Francis I, although is not particularly sixteenth-century in style. The caption also refers to a 'charivari de Breloques' (literally, a cacophony of charms), which is probably a reference to the bunch of fobs and seals hanging from the waist and how they would have clinked together in motion.",
