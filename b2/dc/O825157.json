The following is the full text of the entry: GRANO, ANTONIO (d.1718) 713 The Virgin and Child at the intercession of Saint Rosalia taking pity on the plague-stricken town of Palermo and causing the Angel of Death to sheathe his sword Inscribed (possibly by the artist) 'Anniversario della Peste in Palermo/ Antonio Grano' Pen and ink and wash 8 x 5 5/8 (203 x 143) E.4011-1919 PROVENANCE Bernard H. Webb Bequest 1919 The plague to which the inscription refers is doubtless that of 1624, which ceased when the bones of Saint Rosalia, found by a hunter, were laid in Palermo Cathedral. Hugh Macandrew has stated (1974) that the Ashmolean Museum has a drawing of the Trinity inscribed (or signed) Antonio Grano in the same handwriting. The drawing is differently handled, with denser washes and white heightening, so that it is difficult to say whether it is or is not by the same artist.",
