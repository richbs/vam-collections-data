Three large scale portraits of the actors Amitabh Bachchan, Shashi Kapoor and Rishi Kapoor form the triangle and these are overlaid with a montage of much smaller images of figures, portraits, a couple embracing and a marriage scene. The entire poster has been 'painter-over' which emphasises the facial expressions on three large portraits. On Amitabh's portrait the emphasis is placed on the eyes and the lips which have become his trademark characteristics. The artist's signature is in the bottom left hand corner and the Yash Chopra studio logo is in the top left hand corner. This poster is similar to that of the film Amar Akbar Anthony, see IS.78-1986.",
