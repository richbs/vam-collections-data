A second pot of the same type was found at Mound \"B\" at Jhukar (A.S.I. Memoir No.48, N.G.Majumdar on EXcavations in Sind, Plate 13, fig 11), where it was classified as ' Indo-Sassanian'. Pimpled decoration of the same type appears as early as the chalcolithic strata of Mohenjo-daro (Marshall, Mohenjo-daro, vol.I. p.179), and as late as 11th century A.D. (Firth, quoted by Majumdar). It also appears in 'Barbotine' ware of Roman times.",
