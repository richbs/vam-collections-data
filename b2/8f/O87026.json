The Bedford Master took his name from two outstanding manuscripts made for John of Lancaster, Duke of Bedford and brother of Henry V, victor at Agincourt in 1415. The Bedford Master's style was widely practised in Paris. The Dunois Master appears to have adopted most closely the painting style and models of the Bedford Master. \n\nThis miniature shows scenes from the life of St Julian, who came from an artistocratic background. A stag foretold that he would accidentally kill his parents. One night in Julian's absence his wife allowed his parents to sleep in his bed. Upon his return he killed them, mistakenly assuming that they were his wife and her lover. To make reparation for his sins he set up a hospice by a ford where travellers could find refuge.",
