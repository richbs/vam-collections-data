Here he was highly influenced by the sculpture of antiquity, in terms both of subject and style. He won a prize from the Accademia di San Luca for a terracotta sculpture of Perseus and Andromeda (still in the Accademia collection). He returned to Rome again in 1791. \n\nChinard carved a considerable number of marble busts for members of the Bonaparte family and was known particularly for his portraits of women. This bust was apparently an official portrait of Josephine Bonaparte (1763-1814), wife of Napoleon, and several versions are known including in terracotta. A marble bust of Josephine by Chinard, similar to this one, was recorded as being shown at the official Salon in Paris in 1808. \n\nJosephine's dress has a low-cut bodice with anthemion (honeysuckle) ornament, echoed in her diadem; one of the most popular motifs at the time, derived from classical antiquity and used frequently in the Neoclassical and then Empire style.",
