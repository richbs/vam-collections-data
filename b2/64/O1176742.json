The sketch shows three full length figures. The figure at the centre of the sketch is shown from the back, wearing a bowler hat and suit and carrying a stick. He is standing on a square stage and both his figure and this 'stage' are outlined in black ink. Two further figures appear on the left hand side of the sketch, they are shown in profile, facing towards the figure at the centre. The edges of the paper on which the sketch has been drawn are uneven and burn marks at the far left edge suggest this edge was singed at some point in the past.",
