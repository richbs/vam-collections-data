He was of farreaching Newark ancestry, and was educated at the Magnus Grammar School, from which he proceeded to Exeter College, Oxford. In 1864 he was appointed Assistant- Keeper of the Science and Art Department of the Victoria and Albert Museum at South Kensington, and held that \npost for thirty years. He was on the staff of Punch for many years. A memorial notice of him was contributed to the Magnus Magazine by Mr. T. M. Blagg, another old Magnus boy. It is clear from the testimony of his friends that Sketchley was a man of great charm of manner and singular modesty ; his serious poems show that he had a cultured mind, refined and sensitive ; that he had no common gift for humorous writing is evident from his connexion with such a paper as Punch. He died at Seaford \nin Sussex, and was buried there.",
