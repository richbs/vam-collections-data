Apprenticed to a printer at Hull, moved to London 1805, entered the RA Schools 1807 and studied with Sir Thomas Lawrence. Early works were mainly portraits and nude studies; his first large figure composition was 'The Coral Finder' (1820). Exhibited 138 works at the RA between 1811 and 1850, and 77 at the BI 1811-47. Travelled abroad in 1815/6, 1822, and 1830, principally to Paris and Italy. Elected ARA 1824, RA 1828. A retrospective exhibition was held at the Society of Arts 1849. Died York 13 November 1849. His studio sale was at Christie's 6-10 and 13-14 May 1850. Most admired in his lifetime for his large mythological subjects, but now perhaps more appreciated for his less finished and smaller studies of the nude. \n\nLIT: A Gilchrist <i>Life of William Etty</i> 2 vols, 1855; W Gaunt and F G Roe <i>Etty and the Nude</i> Leigh-on-sea 1943; D Farr <i>William Etty</i> 1958 \n\n<b>Nude Female Figure</b> \n1607 -1871 Neg 82641 \nPanel, 63.1 x 47.9 cm (24 7/8 x 17 7/8 ins) \nPurchased 1871 \n\nDated by Farr to about 1835--40. \n\nPROV: Purchased from S J B Haydon, presumably a dealer, 10 Parliament Street, for \u00a37, 1871 \n\nLIT: <i>Gaunt and Roe</i> pl 40; <i>Farr</i> no 216, p174\"",
