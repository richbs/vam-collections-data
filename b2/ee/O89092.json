In the centre panel the Nativity takes place; The Virgin lies, with the Child above her, to the right. In the left-hand corner is the seated figure of Joseph while above from the left and right respectively come the heads of the ass and ox, the latter shown in disproportionately large figures. In the third panel, below an architectural canopy, the three Magi approach the Virgin and Child. The Virgin is shown holding the nimbed Child on her knee. Between the two groups a star is shown in the sky. Above both the left and right-hand panels is a narrow band of architectural ornaments. The eyes of all figures have ben enlivened with the addition of tiny blue glass beads, most of which survive.",

Ivory carvings appeared on book covers, reliquary caskets, antependia (the panel in front of an altar) and religious icons. This would have originally been from the side of a casket.\nThe work is extremely na\u00efve and provincial, but the closest parallels in both style and iconography are with Italian rather than Spanish sculptures and a date at the beginning of the 13th century seems likely.\nThe format of the scenes, the figure types and canopies may be compared with the more accomplished wooden reliefs from the now-detached wings of the tabernacle containing the Madonna di Costantinopoli in Alatri, of about 1230, and the marble panels on the pulpits in Barga Cathedral and in S. Leonardo in Arcetri outside Florence.\nIt should be noted however that the plaque's earliest known provenance, coupled with stylistic and iconographic peculiarities, might allow for some doubts over its authenticity (for more details see: Williamson, Paul, 2010, pp. 355).",

Bought through John Hunt, London, for \u00a3210, together with inv.no. A.9-1933, an English 13th century ivory relief.\n\nHistorical significance: The work is extremely na\u00efve and provincial, but the closest parallels in both style and iconography are with Italian rather than Spanish sculptures and a date at the beginning of the 13th century seems likely.\nThe format of the scenes, the figure types and canopies may be compared with the more accomplished wooden reliefs from the now-detached wings of the tabernacle containing the Madonna di Costantinopoli in Alatri, of about 1230, and the marble panels on the pulpits in Barga Cathedral and in S. Leonardo in Arcetri outside Florence.\nIt should be noted however that the plaque's earliest known provenance, coupled with stylistic and iconographic peculiarities, might allow for some doubts over its authenticity (for more details see: Williamson, Paul, 2010, pp. 355).",
