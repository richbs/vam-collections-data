The sheet is divided in half by a line, showing that it was meant to be made into two prints. To the right of the drawing, two women look out to sea, while to the left, two women chat at a shrine. The patterns of the beauties' kimono have been drawn in. Such details would have been a major source of interest to buyers of the finished prints. \n\nThis sheet is a copyist's drawing and would have been copied from Eiri's original sketches. The copyist's drawing is usually destroyed when the initial printing block is carved. The survival of this sheet suggests that the designs were never produced as prints.",
