He was a portrait painter and began with purchase of costumes for professional use and spent 30 years in the making of this collection of historical English costume and footwear. Mr Hughes seems to have bought from auctions but also directly from workmen on building sites.\n\nHistorical significance: This shoe is important as an example of how children's shoes reflected adult fashions, and as a survival of a relatively mundane (rather than precious) type of clothing.",

            "historical_context_note": "A large number of leather objects was excavated in London and its neighbourhood  in the early 20th century, notably at Finsbury, Moorgate and London Wall, from rubbish heaps and plague pits. They were not excavations in the modern sense but rather finds made by workmen on building sites and dredges on the river (see Grew, Francis & de Neergaard, Margrethe, <i>Shoes and Pattens. Medieval Finds from Excavations in London:2</i> (London: Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1988).\n\nShoes for the wealthy and for formal wear were made of silk or velvet. Leather shoes were used for more practical occasions, every day wear, travelling and so forth. The locations in which the leather shoes were found and the fact that some are slashed in a similar way to formal shoes, suggest that even lower and middle class citizens of London wore 'fashionable' styles.\n\nA change in construction methods occurred to the <i>welted shoe</i> at the end of the Middle Ages: a welt (a strip of leather) formed part of the construction between the insole and the sole of the shoe. The upper was attached to insole and welt, with a second row of stitches through the welt to attach the sole. The other change of construction was the moving of the principal upper seam to the centre back, producing the traditional vamp and pair of quarters (see Swann, June, <i>Shoemaking</i> (Aylesbury: Shire Publications Ltd., Shire Album 155, 1986). \n\nThe medieval and Tudor shoes found in London were made by cordwainers (shoemakers) who worked in craft guilds. Guilds of cordwainers were formed in Oxford in 1131 and in London before 1160. Measurements were standardised in 1305, suggesting that shoes could be acquired ready-made, as well as bespoke. As well as being sold in towns, shoes were sold at the great medieval fairs, and there was also a profitable second-hand trade in old leather shoes. Most shoemakers were capable of doing repairs, but this was usually considered inferior work and left it to a different type of craftsmen, such as cobblers. \n\nThis shoe would probably fit a 1-2 year old child today (in 2006). It is generally sturdy and well made, having a reinforced back heel to prevent wear. The style would have been fairly impractical for a small child, who was still wobbly on his or her feet, but it would have been fashionable in the first half of the 16th century. The shoe has been used a great deal, the wear and distortion on it probably being caused by normal walking. It is possible this shoe was secondhand, the secondary slit vertically down from the throat of this shoe, being inserted to adjust the shoe to the instep of the toddler. Or the child just wore them till he/she grew out of them.",
