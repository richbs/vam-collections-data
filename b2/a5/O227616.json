N. / PRODUCED IN EMBOSSED LEATHER AND EMBOSSED LEATHER-PAPER / </I>\n <i>\u201cTHE GOLDEN AGE.\u201d / TECHNICALLY, the object in this design has been to / produce as rich and sumptuous an effect as possible. / It is an arrangement of masses and curves upon / the geometric basis formed by the intersecting semicircles of / the garlands, which form a scale pattern, upon which is built, / as on a scaffolding, the varied features of the design. The main / idea is symmetrical, as in the central group of the two amorinis / supporting the trophy of fruit. Rigid symmetry has, however, been / avoided, and the principle blended with the alternate system, as in / the arrangement of the cockatoos which counterbalance each other / on this plan. The goat also serves the double purpose of breaking / the formality and filling the space between the two figures. / As the design is intended to suggest all manner of pleasant / things \u2013 enjoyment of life in a happy conition of equality in the / possession of the fruits of the earth, and the revival of innocent / content and animal spirits amid the plenty of nature, excluding all / thought of sickness or sorrow \u2013 I have named it \u201cThe Golden Age,\u201d / the dream of which, whether in the past or in the future, whether / earthly or heavenly, humanity must always cherish, and which even / if we are sceptical to its past existence or future realisation, we / can at least realise it in thought, and have its image and emblems / upon out walls. / WALTER CRANE./ JUNE, 1886</i>",
