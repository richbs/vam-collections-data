This image showing a line of men seated at a bar is a good example of the compassionate yet unromantic way in which he represented everyday life.\n\n\u2018He often brings our attention to the peripheral, or sub-dramatic, moments or transactions or places.  It is often as though the photograph had virtually composed itself.\u2019\n\nJane Livingstone, M.

He met Tina Modotti in 1927, when she was working in Mexico City, and through her sent his portfolio to Edward Weston in 1929 who was impressed by Bravo\u2019s work.  He taught photography at the Academy of San Carlos in 1930 (when Diego Rivera was director) and again in 1932-3.  He was commissioned in 1930 to photograph painted murals by Mexican artists including Frida Kahlo and David Siqueiros.  During the 1930s Bravo was exposed to many artistic influences through meeting leading cultural figures, including Paul Strand in 1933 with whom he developed a close friendship, and the Surrealist poet and artist Andr\u00e9 Breton (who was living in Diego Rivera\u2019s house in 1938). He also met Henri Cartier-Bresson in 1934 and they had a joint exhibition the following year which was shown in New York and Mexico.  During the late 1940s and 1950s Bravo was employed as a photographer and cameraman at the Mexican Institute of Cinematography and carried out very little personal photographic work.  He left the Institute in 1959 to begin the Editorial Foundation of Mexican Plastic Arts, which published fine art books of Mexican art in which many of Bravo\u2019s photographs of Mexican material culture appeared.  Bravo donated his early photographs to the Museum of Modern Art in Mexico in 1972.  He died in 2002, in Mexico City.",
