Kilns produced large objects for use at court as well as smaller domestic pieces for private customers. In about 1800 they began to produce elegant white openwork porcelain objects such as this brush pot. Painting and calligraphy were essential accomplishments of the Choson gentleman, and this piece would have graced a scholar's study, serving its function but also delighting the eye.\n\nPlain white wares, with their connotations of purity and honesty, were particularly popular in a culture embedded in Confucian philosophy. The bluish tinge of the glaze of this pot is a typical feature of Korean porcelains and becomes all the more pronounced if the glaze is thickly applied. The deftly carved design is of stylised peonies and foliage on winding stems with incised markings.",
