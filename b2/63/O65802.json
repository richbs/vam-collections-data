He was the youngest son of Jesse, who lived in Bethlehem, and was originally a shepherd. Eventually David became King of Israel, because of a prophecy told to the reigning king, Saul. The Gospel of St Matthew in the New Testament records David as a direct ancestor of Jesus Christ. \n\nThe Christian church has always believed that God spoke through his prophets. They were seen as the deliverers of God\u2019s messages concerning the future, including the Coming of the Messiah. In the medieval period David was included among them. Prophet panels are also known as \u2018messenger panels\u2019, because they convey these divinely inspired prophecies or messages. \n\nIn this panel we see David holding a scroll with a passage from Psalm 47. In the Middle Ages people believed that David wrote some of the Psalms. The text on the scroll refers to God ascending among shouts of joy and trumpet blasts.\n\nOriginally, the panel would have been placed above or below a larger one depicting a scene from the New Testament. This scene would be related to the passage recorded on the prophet\u2019s scroll. Here it would be an image of the Ascension of Christ. This arrangement is known as a \u2018typology\u2019, by which persons or events in the Old Testament are prophetic symbols of ones in the New Testament.",

He was the youngest son of Jesse and a shepherd who eventually became king of Israel because of a prophecy told to the reigning king, Saul.\n\nThe Gospel of St. Matthew in the New Testament records him as a direct ancestor of Jesus Christ. \n\nFrom the earliest centuries of the Christian Church it was believed that God had spoken through his prophets. So they were thought of as the deliverers of His messages concerning the future including the Coming of the Messiah. In the medieval period David was included amongst the prophets.\n\nThese prophet panels are also known as 'messenger panels' because they convey these divinely inspired prophecies or messages. In this panel we see David holding a scroll with a passage from the 47th Psalm. It was believed in the Middle Ages that David was the author of some of the Psalms. The text on the scroll refers to God ascending amongst shouts of joy and trumpets blowing.\n\nThe panel would have originally been placed above or below a larger panel depicting a scene from the New Testament. This scene would be related to the passage recorded on the prophet's scroll. Here it would be the image of the Ascension of Christ. This arrangement is known as a 'typology' by which persons or events in the Old Testament are prophetic symbols of persons or events in the New Testament.",
