Martin's work demonstrates that by the end of the 19th century photography was no longer the preserve of aristocratic amateurs and professional studios. Anyone could now make snapshots of their life and surroundings. These seascapes and townscapes were printed using the carbon process which was most popular between 1870 and 1910. The prints show rich monochrome tones and used various pigments, most commonly black, brown or blue. The most important feature of a carbon print is its permanence, as it is not formed on light sensitive photographic paper which can deteriorate, but is printed with in stable inks.",
