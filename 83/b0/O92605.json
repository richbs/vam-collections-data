Christ is shown as the Pantocrator ('Creator of All'), with his right hand raised in blessing.

This was presumably done because the extremely thin background - seen on the best Byzantine plaques - had broken or been badly cracked. It is also not possible to judge if the throne was backless or had a high back, both types being depicted in Middle Byzantine ivories. There are traces of crimson paint, mostly in the deep folds of the drapery and in the background around the footstool, are not original. The three holes were probably drilled after the plaque's conversion to an applique figure, probably on a book cover.\nIn the possession of John Webb, London, purchased from Webb, 1867.",

The Christ was probably originally the centre of a triptych. Byzantine ivories have been divided into several stylistic groups. These 'groups' are not so clear-cut as it once seemed and their dating is a problematic issue since few pieces give any indication as to when they were produced and it is possible that the style of the carvings remained static for long periods of time, undergoing only minimal changes even over a century. The group to which this ivory belongs is known as the 'Romanos' group, from a plaque representing the Emperor Romanos and his bride Eudokia dated to either 945-949 or 1068-1071 depending on whether the two figures are seen as the Emperor Romanos II and his wife Eudokia or as the later Emperor Romanos IV and Eudokia Makrembolitissa.",
