The collars are enamelled with flowers and insect motifs between four applied enamelled roundels in scalloped silver mounts.

Here the term has been used rather loosely to refer to the silver cup set within the emu egg with the top cut to form the cover. The tradition of mounting exotic, natural materials in elaborate gold, silver and jewelled or enamelled mounts dates back to the Renaissance.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe enamel plaques illustrate the classical myth of the rape of Persephone or Proserpine, the daughter of the harvest goddess, Ceres. One day, when gathering flowers in a meadow with a companion, Proserpine was observed by Pluto, the king of the underworld. Overcome with sudden lust, he swept her up in his chariot, caused a great chasm in the earth to open before them and carried Proserpine to his kingdom below. The myth also tells of Ceres's subsequent wanderings in search of her daughter and Proserpine's return to earth each year in the spring.  Hence the inclusion of spring flowers and insects in the decoration of the enamel panels.\n\nPeople\nThe enamel work, backed with foil on copper was executed by Phoebe Anna Traquair. Phoebe Traquair (1852-1936) was a mural decorator, enameller, illuminator, painter and embroideress. Born in Dublin, she received her artistic training at the Dublin School of Art. She moved to Edinburgh in 1873 when she married Ramsay Traquair, Keeper of the Edinburgh Museum of Science and Art.  The silver mounts were made by Henry Tatton who was in partnership with J.M. Talbot.",
