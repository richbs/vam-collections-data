They fastened their clothes with decorative hooks, usually linked to each other by lengths of chain.  These were worn across the front of the dress, across the back of the head, and down the front of the skirt. \n\nThis piece consists of a pair of earrings linked by a chain with a central hook.  The earrings are typical of those worn throughout the Balkans.  They were probably inserted through the ear lobes, but were also often hooked into the hair or head scarf behind the ears.  The chain hung round the back of the head, hooked into the head covering by the central hook.  It was bought for 16 shillings at the International Exhibition, London, 1872.\n\nThe use of coins as pendants dates from the Ottoman period.  It emphasizes the financial importance of jewellery to women.  The safest way to keep their wealth secure was to wear it.",
