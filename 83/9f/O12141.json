            "public_access_description": "This mould is reverse-carved with a gadrooned flaming urn. Gadrooning is a decoration with convex curves, the opposite of fluting. The mould was used for the multiple production of architectural ornament in plaster or in \u2018compo\u2019. \u2018Compo\u2019 is a generic term for \u2018composition\u2019, a paste or putty. It usually consisted of four basic ingredients: whiting, glue, rosin and linseed oil. \nReverse-carved moulds of this kind were widely used from about 1780 until about 1900. Initially, the ornament was produced by pressing a thickness of \u2018compo\u2019 into the oiled mould, and squeezing it in a screw press. The pressing could then be removed from the mould in a still warm and flexible state and applied to the surface to be decorated. The use of moulds to make reproduction ornament greatly reduced the demand for ornamental carving in wood.\nComposition manufactories, as well as firms such as carvers and gilders, used moulds and commissioned them from specialist workshops. This mould comes from a collection of moulds that the London firm of George Jackson & Sons Ltd (trading in 1780) gave to the Museum in 1988, when they became a subsidiary of Clark & Fenn Ltd. Jackson\u2019s had acquired moulds from other companies, such as the London-based firm of Brown\u2019s, who went out of business in the first half of the 20th century. It is thus unlikely that they made the whole collection of moulds.",

Composition manufactories, in addition to firms such as carvers and gilders, used these moulds which were commissioned from carvers' workshops. \n\nIt is thought that the Adam brothers played a major role in the initial manufacture of ornament on a grand scale in this way, and are rumoured to have employed a George Jackson (1756-1840), the founder of the present company, George Jackson & Sons Ltd.

Thus the turn of the 18th century gradually witnessed a sharp decline in the number of carvers, those still remaining in employment often working in reverse as opposed to relief, to create the moulds.\n\nThe mould was made for the mass production of architectural ornament from moulding materials, such as \"compo\" (a generic term for the paste or putty, usually consisting of four basic ingredients: whiting, glue, rosin and linseed oil.

Further research will help to establish their date through their style of pattern.  The majority of the collection (without further analysis) seems to be made of box and various fruitwoods.  However other woods are in evidence for exmple, the supporting blocks for the finer strips of boxwood, into which the ornament has been carved.  \n\nThe presence of machine planer marks are in evidence on many of the moulds, which will assist in establishing their date.  Others have no such evidence, and hand cut fixing such as nails.  \n\nThere are many beautiful examples of the carver's art within this collection, particularly those bearing the initials or names of the carvers.",

The pressing could then be removed from the mould in a still warm and flexible state and applied to the substrate.  Towards the middle of the 19th century, machines were introduced and more widely used in the production process.",
