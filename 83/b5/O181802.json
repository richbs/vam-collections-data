The nightmarish quality of the central area is enlivened by the playfulness of the putti across the top, the fish which swims down the tree trunk and the comical snails which lend a humourous streak to such compositions. The masks, grotesques and strapwork seen in this example were common features of Mannerism and were a new contribution to ornamental design which was much admired and copied in northern Europe. Antwerp was a major centre of printmaking and distribution, with Cornelis Floris one of its most prolific printmakers. Prints such as this spread these styles across Europe.",
