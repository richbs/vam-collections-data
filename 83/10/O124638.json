Apprenticed to a printer at Hull, moved to London 1805, entered the RA Schools 1807 and studied with Sir Thomas Lawrence. Early works were mainly portraits and nude studies; his first large figure composition was 'The Coral Finder' (1820). Exhibited 138 works at the RA between 1811 and 1850, and 77 at the BI 1811-47. Travelled abroad in 1815/6, 1822, and 1830, principally to Paris and Italy. Elected ARA 1824, RA 1828. A retrospective exhibition was held at the Society of Arts 1849. Died York 13 November 1849. His studio sale was at Christie's 6-10 and 13-14 May 1850. Most admired in his lifetime for his large mythological subjects, but now perhaps more appreciated for his less finished and smaller studies of the nude. \n\nLIT: A Gilchrist <i>Life of William Etty</i> 2 vols, 1855; W Gaunt and F G Roe <i>Etty and the Nude</i> Leigh-on-sea 1943; D Farr <i>William Etty</i> 1958 \n\n<b>Innocence: Head of a Young Girl</b> \n498-1882 Neg L898 \nCanvas, oval, 43.1 x 33 cm (17 x 13 ins) \nJones Bequest 1882 \n\nFarr dates the painting to about 1820 on stylistic grounds, and suggests it is the portrait of Miss Wallace painted in 1820 and exhibited at the Society of Arts in 1849. It is similar to works by Sir Thomas Lawrence, with whom Etty studied, such as the portrait of the Calmady sisters (exhibited at the RA 1824; now Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York). \n\nA variant canvas, 39.4 x 34.3 cm (15\u00bd x 13\u00bd ins), is owned by the RA; a similar painting 42 x 32.4 cm (16\u00bd x 12\u00be ins), was sold at Christie's 28 April 1933 (87), as 'Lawrence', 'Head of a Lady, with white decollete dress'. \n\nPROV: ?C W Wass (see Exh: below); ?Henry Wallis, his sale Christie's 17 November 1860 (127, 'Innocence') bought by the dealer Richard Colls \u00a313; bequeathed by John [ones to the museum 1882 \n\nEXH: ?Society of Arts 1849 (LXI, 'Portrait of Miss Wallace', lent by C W Wass) \n\nLIT: <i>Farr</i> no 195, p172, repr pl 11b\"",
