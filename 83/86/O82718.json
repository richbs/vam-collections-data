The study has much in common with the foregrounds of Constable's large river and canal scenes but has not been identified as a direct study for any of them. It has particular affinities with the foreground of 'The Lock' (1824), and 'The Leaping Horse' (1825); this circumstance, together with the breadth of style, seems to justify a dating between 1820 and 1830; and No. 325 [785-1888] above may be assigned on grounds of style and subject-matter to the same period. This dating is supported by comparison with the group of eleven oil sketches of foliage, waterfowl, etc., mounted as drawings in the British Museum, one of which (No. 1919-4-15-6) is dated <i>Brighton July 28 1828</i>, and another (No. 1919-4-15-4) <i>July 25 1828</i>. \n\nW. P. Frith, R.A., in <i>My Autobiography and Reminiscences</i>, Vol. III, 1888, pp. 318-19, gives an account of his visit to Constable's studio which is relevant to such studies as these: \"There was a piece of the trunk of a tree in the room, some weeds, and some dock-leaves. 'And what line of the art do you intend to follow?' said Constable to me. 'I don't know, Sir', I replied ... 'Well, whatever it may be,' said the great landscape painter, 'never do anything without nature before you, if it be possible to have it. See those weeds and the dock-leaves? They are to come into the foreground of this picture. I know dock-leaves pretty well, but I should not attempt to introduce them into a picture without having them before me\u2019\".  \n\nFrith paid the visit in company with the drawing-master Sass, with whom he was a pupil c. 1835-7.  The episode, if correctly recalled after an interval of fifty years, therefore refers to 'The Valley Farm', 'The Cenotaph' or 'Arundel Mill and Castle'; probably to the latter.\"",
