He designed and made the screen especially for himself, and it stayed in his London studio until his death in 1959.\n\nThe scenes on the screen are painted in oils upon glass and represent an allegory of the arts. While the screen is conventional in form, based on eighteenth century French models, it is decorated with jazzy Art Deco patterns and vibrantly coloured scenes painted in a stylized manner. The panels depict a composer writing music, an artist in his studio painting a still-life, a scene in a theatre, and an author at work. The panels also represent the progress of the day, with the composer working at dawn, the artist painting at midday, the theatre representing a typical evening entertainment, and the author \"burning the midnight oil\" by working late into the night.",
