            "public_access_description": "Contained within a small brown bound presentation book this object is a panoramic view of Queen Victoria's marriage procession through the State Apartments of St James\u2019s Palace to the altar of the Chapel Royal, St James's Palace. \n\nEach section of the handcoloured lithograph (which is almost three metres in length) is carefully labelled with the names of the figures in the procession amidst which are the Queen and her twelve bridesmaids, who process towards Prince Albert and Queen Adelaide, (the widow of King William IV). The Duchess of Kent, Queen Victoria\u2019s mother, stands in front of the bridal group. \n\nThe details of procession have been carefully recorded and as the objects shows, it was Prince Albert's portion of the procession which moved first, preceded by the Lord and Deputy Chamberlains, who conducted His Royal Highness to the chapel where he remained on the right hand side, or left of the altar.  He was attended by his Gentleman of Honor, and the Reigning Duke and Hereditary Prince of Saxe Coburg (his father and elder brother) and their suites, and preceded by drums and trumpets.  On reaching his chair, Prince Albert advanced to the Queen Dowager and respectfully kissed her hand.\n\nThe Lord Chamberlain and Deputy Chamberlain then returned to Queen Victoria, and her Majesty's procession advanced preceded by music, and guided by the Officers of the Earl Marshal. The procession passed through the Throne Room, the Ante Throne Room, Queen Anne's Drawing Room, the Guard Chamber, the Armory, the Grand Staircase, and the Colonnade leading to the Chapel.  All these apartments were sumptuously adorned, and in all of them seats had been prepared for the spectators fortunate enough to have obtained tickets to view the procession from these places. \n\nThe ornate Honiton lace trim on Queen Victoria\u2019s rich white satin dress (made from Spitalfields silk) has also been carefully recorded. The orange flower blossoms with which her hair and gown were also decorated are less obvious but are known to have been worn. Prince Albert wore a field marshal\u2019s uniform, with large rosettes of white satin on his shoulders.\n\nThe wedding ceremony was followed by a sumptuous wedding breakfast after which the Queen and Prince Albert departed for Windsor Castle.",
