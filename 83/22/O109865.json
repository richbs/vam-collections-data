He was an avid collector of French 18th-century furniture and porcelain and his bequest to the V&A is one of the largest it has ever received. \n\nWhen he bought this writing table, he thought that it was made in France in about 1780, but as a result of examinations this dating has been revised. It now seems likely that the table was made in London between about 1860 and 1880. Some of the porcelain plaques have slightly dished edges, suggesting that they were cut from 18th-century French tableware from the S\u00e8vres porcelain factory. During the 19th century in Britain there was such high admiration for 18th-century French furniture that thousands of copies were made, some intended as fakes, some more innocently using the same materials and colours to evoke the period.",
