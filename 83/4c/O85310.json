ISBN 1851773088.\nMarc Foster Grant is the chairman of Jeanne-Marc (named for Grant and his wife and design partner Jeanne Allen), an extremely successful San Francisco-based company, founded in 1974, specialising in fabric and clothing design. A quarter-century ago, however, Grant was a student in printmaking at Brighton Polytechnic School of Art and Design in England. After graduating from San Francisco State College in 1970, he and Allen (who met as co-workers at the San Francisco branch of the retailer Design Research) left for Europe, finding their way to Finland where Grant hand-screened fabrics for the Marimekko factory. Moving to England to pursue a master's degree in printmaking, Grant enrolled at Brighton and joined a class taught by Harvey Daniels, a charismatic teacher and Art Deco collector who assembled around him what Grant describes as an international group of students uncharacteristic of English schools.\nOne day in 1973 there were visitors to Daniels's class. Staff from the V&A's Circulation Department were looking for work suitable for \"The Fabric of Pop,\" a travelling exhibition of Pop imagery in textiles and fashion of the late 1960s and 1970s. In those years, Circulation staff essentially scavenged door to door - often in art schools - to acquire contemporary design works. They selected from among Grant's work several screenprinted pieces, including his \"Haircut\" fabric, and a big quilted, tasselled pillow screenprinted with images of water-skiers that the artist recalls vividly. Grant reports that there was never a question of being paid for these works; the student designers were so excited by the Museum's interest and the prospect of exhibition that they gave to the V&A whatever the curators liked.\n\"Haircut? Yes Please!\" is unique. Grant made the screen and printed a single twelve-foot run of cotton sateen (he printed enough of the \"Haircut\" pattern on muslin to make a pair of pajamas, specifically so that he could see how the print would drape in clothing.) The artist reports that in designing the print, he was remembering the commercial graphics common in barber shops in the United States in the 1950s and 1960s that depicted styles from which the customer could choose. \"Haircut? Yes Please!\" is entertaining and nostalgic by virtue of its subject - period haircut styles and their amusing period names - and it is visually compelling in the boldness of its pattern repeat. But there is also a subversive seriousness to the design, reflected in its spectrum of human skin colours and the sensitivity and variety of facial expressions among the rows of heads. Having come of age in an era of racial divide in America, Grant must have been conscious that his \"Haircut\" pattern was not simply a handsome abstraction but carried a specific sociopolitical subtext. In designing that duality into his fabric, Grant's \"Haircut\" pays homage to the form-and-content dualities of the best of classic sixties American Pop Art.\n\nLit.
