            "public_access_description": "A pax (Latin: 'peace') is a small plaque with a representation of the Crucifixion or other religious subject on the face and a projecting handle on the back. Paxes symbolised the kiss or embrace which the priest celebrating mass passed to his subordinates, and which was then transferred to the congregation. The pax was kissed first by the celebrant, and then by others who received it (and kissed it) in turn.\n\nThis pax, and a plaque from another also in the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A M.204-1956), were probably made for the Carthusian Monastery of Miraflores, Burgos, which was founded by John II of Castile in 1441 and, after a fire, rebuilt in 1453-1484. The maker of this pax, Juan de Horna (or Orna) (ca. 1475-1543) lived and worked in Burgos, the main centre for silversmithing in Castile (central Spain). Horna was praised by sixteenth-century writers for designing and decorating his pieces using motifs from the Classical past, at a time when the Classical style in Spain was arguably most evident in architecture and sculpture. Modern scholars have described this pax as a masterpiece of Renaissance Spanish silver.",

            "history_note": "[Pax] Juan de Horna (or Orna) (ca. 1475-1543) lived and worked in Burgos, which was the main centre for silversmithing in Castile (central Spain). In 1585 another silversmith, Juan de Arfe, included Horna in a list of silversmiths who used Classical motifs and designs in their works (Arfe, <u>De varia commesuracion</u>, Book IV, folio 3 recto).\n\nThis pax, and a plaque from another also in the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A M.204-1956), were probably made for the Carthusian Monastery of Miraflores, Burgos, which was founded by John II of Castile in 1441 and rebuilt after a fire 1453-1484 (see Mart\u00edn, 'Spain: Metalwork'). The Museum purchased Horna's pax \u00a373.13.8 in 1864, from Francisco Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rez, a silversmith in the Plaza Mayor, Salamanca.\n\nHistorical significance: The maker of this pax, Juan de Horna (or Orna) (ca. 1475-1543) lived and worked in Burgos, the main centre for silversmithing in Castile (central Spain). Horna was praised by sixteenth-century writers for designing and decorating his pieces using motifs from the Classical past, at a time when the Classical style in Spain was arguably most evident in architecture and sculpture. Modern scholars have described this pax as a masterpiece of Renaissance Spanish silver.\n\nThe decision to foreground the miracle of Ildephonsus on the pax may reflect the name of the donor (shown kneeling before the cross in the background). The choice may also have been influenced by the royal nature of the foundation where the pax was destined. Ildephonsus was archbishop of Toledo, Spain's principal See where kings of Spain were crowned (or crowned themselves). (For the significance of Toledo, see Linehan, 1993).\n[Ornament] This plaque was added at the base of the pax at an unknown date in the object's history, perhaps as an expression of devotion, or to embellish the piece. It may also have represented an attempt to add monetary value to the pax. The pax with this plaque attached is illustrated in Ria\u00f1o, Juan F. <u>The Industrial Arts in Spain</u>, p.33.",

'pax brede'). Paxes symbolised the kiss or embrace which the priest celebrating mass passed to his subordinates, and which was then transferred to the congregation. The pax was kissed first by the celebrant, and then by others who received it (and kissed it) in turn. Arfe, in his <u>De varia commesuracion</u> fols 28 verso - 29 recto, lays down a set of rules for the design and ornamentation of paxes. He stipulates that they should not have parts that protrude too far, so as not to harm the worshipper's face, and that the handle on the reverse should be wide enough to fill the holder's hand, but light enough to prevent the pax tipping backwards.",
