He created settings and costumes for all forms of entertainment - ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue - as well as working in interior decoration and textile design. His lavish, painterly and romantic concepts were perfectly in tune with the times and earned him an international reputation.  By 1960, however, that style was becoming unfashionable, and Messel gradually abandoned theatre and built a new career designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.  \n\nAlexander Korda\u2019s The Private Life of Don Juan (1934), which starred Douglas Fairbanks senior as the legendary lover, provided Messel with his first opportunity to design costumes for a film production. 'Sennwald', writing for the New York Times, gave the film a lukewarm review but praised the designs: \u2018Chiefly it is interesting for its visual distinction and for its gallery of ravishing ladies' (New York Times, 10 December 1934).\n\nDouglas Fairbanks (1883-1939) played Don Juan.  Sennwald was unmercifully critical 'The bounding one\u2019s current return to the screen has about it a lamentable air of anachronism \u2026 the microphone is ruthlessly unkind to him.  Neither in voice nor theatrical skill is he gifted to read lines.'  (New York Times, 10 December 1934)",
