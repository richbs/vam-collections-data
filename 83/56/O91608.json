This tankard is comparable with other such tankards also with biblical scenes that were made in Danzig (modern Gdansk) for the Protestant churches in the area. One for example shows Christ and the Samaritan Woman at the Well by Christian Pichgiel (worked 1681-1700) for the church of Stargard. A large number of Danzig pieces survive from the second half of the 17th century and early 18th century, when Danzig goldsmiths\u2019 work was most admired in Poland and Russia. Two vessel forms are typical for this period: tankards such as this, which replaced the standing cup, and the flaring beaker, either embossed or set with coins or medals.\n\nDaniel was born in Danzig in 1657. He became a master in 1689 and finished his masterpiece under Peter Rohde. He was an elder of the Guild in 1702 and 1708. In 1711 he withdrew from it to become a merchant, but soon gave that up as well. The name Mylius frequently appears among Augsburg goldsmiths.",

This piece was probably originally parcel-gilt. This tankard is comparable with other such tankards also with biblical scenes made in Danzig for the Protestant churches in the area.  One for example shows Christ and the Samaritan woman at the Well by Christian Pichgiel (worked 1681-1700) for the church of Stargard.  A large number of Danzig pieces survive from the second half of the 17th century and early 18th century when Danzig goldsmiths work was most admired in Poland and Russia.  Two vessel forms are typical for this period: tankards such as this, which replaced the standing cup, and the flaring beaker, either embossed or set with coins or medals.\nDaniel was born in Danzig in 1657 and became a master in 1689 and finished his masterpiece under Peter Rohde.  He was an elder of the Guild in 1702 and 1708 and 1711 he withdrew from it to become a merchant but soon gave that up as well. The name Mylius frequently appears among Augsburg goldsmiths.",
