(1706-1783)</b> \n\nDesign for a candlestick in the rococo style incorporating the figure of Daphne, turning into a laurel tree.  English, mid-18th century. \n<i>Signed</i> G:M:Moser. iv & dell[<i>sic</i>]. \n<i>Pen and ink and brown wash.</i>                     E.4885-1968 \n\nPurchased with the assistance of S. J. Phillips Ltd. \n\n<i>Note:</i> Moser was a native of Switzerland who came to England at an early age and lived there all his life.  He was a chaser in gold by profession, and one of the founders of he Royal Academy, also its first Keeper, which post he held until his death.  He was one of the most successful exponents of the rococo style in England, and this design for a candlestick shows the influence of the engraved designs of Juste Aur\u00e8le Meissonnier.  The figure of Daphne also owes something to Bernini's 'Daphne pursued by Apollo'. \nThe drawing was Lot 134 in Christie's sale of the property of Elizabeth Richardson Simmons of New York, 12 November 1968. \nIt is fully discussed in 'A Design for a Candlestick by George Michael Moser, R.A.' by Shirley Bury and Desmond Fitz-Gerald, <i>Victoria and Albert Museum Yearbook</i>, 1969, pp.27-29 (repr. fig. 1).\"",
