Although the term at that time would have implied that the ring had been made anywhere in the Bengal Presidency, a much larger area than present-day Bengal, it is possible that it was made in Calcutta. This was a major centre in the 19th century for jewellery made by Indian goldsmiths in European style, as here. The maker may have seen engravings or examples of 19th century European rings including a motif of two hands clasping each other, indicating love or friendship. The meaning of the motif is lost in this ring, as the gold hands, joined at the wrist and applied to the top of the gold hoop, face away from each other. A parrot perches on top of them, carved in the round from a single sapphire and set with ruby eyes and a beak made of almandine garnet.",
