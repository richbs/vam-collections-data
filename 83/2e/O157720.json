            "public_access_description": "The composition of Boschetti's tabletop follows one of Michelangelo Baberi's most successful works, The Triumph of Cupid, which was highly publicised at the time (1823). It was engraved by Luigi Calamatta (1802-69) and explained with regards to the meanings behind the symbolic contents of the roundels. The central composition comes from Petrarch's description of Amor in Trionfo d'Amore which describes Cupid as being 'a cruel youth with bow in hand and arrows at his side; / nothing did he fear, therefore he wore neither mail no shield / But on his shoulders only two great wings / Of a thousand colours, otherwise he was nude.' \n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
