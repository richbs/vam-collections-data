London: Sotheby Publications, in association with the Victoria and Albert Museum, 1982.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n'<b>1072</b> \nPreliminary drawing for 'Grafton\u2019\n1883\nPencil and watercolour\n42.5 x 34.9 cm\nE.955-1954\n\nThe above 2 items, nos 1071, 1072, were bequeathed by Miss Mary (May) Morris, daughter of the artist.'\n\nNB: 'no 1071' is object E.38-1940.\nParry, Linda, ed. <u>William Morris</u> London : Philip Wilson in association with the Victoria and Albert Museum, 1996. Published to coincide with an exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum, 9 May-1 Sept. 1996.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n'<b>L.26</b> Design for <i>Grafton</i> wallpaper\n\nWilliam Morris, <i>c</i>.1883 \nPencil, watercolour and bodycolour, 68.8 x 43.5 cm \nInscribed \nWilliam Morris Society, Kelmscott House, London (D5) \n\nA fully worked and coloured design ready for the cutter and printer. It is marked \u2018leave out pins\u2019 \u2013 and the paper was issued without the dotted ground. The pattern has been traced out in pencil, and horizontal and vertical guidelines are visible. The repeating element is small, appearing twice within the 21-inch inch square format. The central portion has been coloured, somewhat roughly, and a list of blocks is given: \u2018Pale Green 1; Yellow 2; 2nd green 3\u2019. \n\nWithout dotting, hatching, veining, outline or underprint, this is a very two dimensional, non-naturalistic pattern. The use of the ground to separate individual elements in the flowers and stems is reminiscent of stencilling, where the natural qualities of the process result in such an effect. \n\n\n<b>L.27</b> Three wallpaper printing blocks for <i>Grafton</i> pattern \nProbably cut by Barrett\u2019s, <i>c</i>.1883 \nCarved deal and fruit wood, approx. 56.0 x 51.0 x 5.0 cm each \nArthur Sandersons & Sons Ltd. \n\nThe blocks are composed of a triple sandwich of wood: the bottom two layers are deal; the topmost is a hard and fine-grained fruit wood. Those areas that are not required to print have been cut away. <i>Grafton</i> is built up of flat fields of colour, without lines or dots, and the blocks do not feature any of the metal strips or pins that would be necessary for fine detail. \n\nDuring the course of normal use, blocks sometimes have to be repaired or recut. These examples, however, are the original set and still bear the 1883 registration mark at the edge. They were produced by Barrett\u2019s of Bethnal Green, a specialist firm which cut blocks and rollers for other companies as well, including Jeffrey\u2019s. At least four generations of Barretts were employed in this very skilled work; Morris dealt with Joseph (1812-76) and Alfred (1847-1918). Much depends on the cutter\u2019s skill in tracing the original design, transferring the outlines of each colour to a separate block and then accurately routing out the unwanted portions. George Wardle recalled that the cutter\u2019s tracing was always submitted to Morris before it could be \u2018rubbed off\u2019. \n\n\n<b>L.28</b> Wallpaper matchpiece, <i>Grafton, 235</i> \n\nDesigned by William Morris, pattern registered 29 June 1883, matchpiece made <i>c</i>.1950 \nPrinted by Arthur Sanderson & Sons Ltd. \nBlock-printed in distemper colours, 1000.00 x 56.0 cm \nArthur Sanderson & Sons Ltd. \n\nA matchpiece is the printer\u2019s template. It shows the colours to be used and the order of printing. \n\nIn the printing process a block is dipped, face down, onto a \u2018blanket\u2019 furnished with pigment, charging the raised surfaces with colour. Still face down, it is pressed onto a waiting roll of paper, transferring a portion of the pattern. This is repeated all along the roll, taking care that each impression is placed correctly alongside its predecessor. When the pigment is dry, the next colour is printed in the same manner, until the pattern is complete. Accurately fitting the impressions together (\u2018registration\u2019) is essential. \n\nThree blocks were used to print <i>Grafton</i> (cat.no.L.27), which was available as both a two- and three colour pattern. In this example two blocks print the same shade of yellow.'",
