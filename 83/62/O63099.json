Figures are seen in Burmese dress and the court costumes of the Konbaung Dynasty as worn in the 2nd part of the 19th century. The paintings display a mixture of Burmese and Western technique. An adaptation of perspective is seen in the landscapes.\n[Painting] It shows the king seated on a chair beside a pond, with two umbrellas held above his head, watching a cockfight with other spectators. The two small bags would have contained silver rupees which were probably intended as prize money.\n[Painting] The King and Queen are seated on mats on the bank of a river receiving ministers.\n[Painting] The King and Queen seated in a pavilion, in a pastoral setting of palm trees dotted along a bank of a stream, listening to music and watching jugglers. The piles of material on the ground are pasoe and lengths of cloth for gaung baung (turbans) which were \"given by way of payment\". The small bag would have contained silver rupees for payment to the higher ranking performers.\n[Painting] The King and Queen seated in a pavilion with an attendant lady-in-waiting, in pastoral surroundings entertained by performing artists and musicians. As in IS 36 c & e - 1974 lengths of cloth for pasoe and gaung-baung and a sack of silver rupees will be given by way of payment.\n[Painting] Shows a pastoral scene with a king and queen seated in a pavilion attended by two ladies-in-waiting and ministers and entertained by musicians. As in IS 36c - 1974 the piles of material on the ground and the sack with silver rupees will be used for payment of the artists.\n[Painting] A pastoral scene lit by 4 shaded lamps with musicians and a dancer. It includes a picture of a lu-shwin-daw (clown). Such characters of the period are always depicted without a jacket and with their pasoe tucked up between their thighs (khar-daung-kyaik). His role was to sing witty and sometimes naughty songs and mimic the dancers or in this case the la-gwin cymbal player and the oh-zi drummer.",
