A loom piece beginning with a short cut fringe and 2 cm of light brown and black weft in chevron bands followed by 3 cm without weft. The main area is patterned with bands:\n[1] narrow bands of chevrons in blue, pink, white and then blue.\n[2] a deeper band, 7.5 cm deep, with a white diaper\n[3] repeat [1]\n[4] a deeper band, 9.5 cm deep, with a blue diaper\n[5] repeat [2] but this time it's only 7 cm deep\n[6] repeat of [1].\nThis arrangement leads into the central field which is 88 cm long and has a small black diaper with a white diaper lozenge in the middle.  This has a blue central lozenge with pendant-like extensions and red details. Above and below the white lozenge there is a red diapered geometric motif of uncertain meaning: it is based on a rounded triangle with strap-like extensions.  Does it represent a tie-on garment? It has blue details. The black diaper has a stepped outline and extends towards the white lozenge in tapestry-woven 'fingers' reminiscent of flat-woven [kelim] floor coverings.\nThe chevron bands [1] to [6] are repeated above the central panel but there is no light brown band after the warp only band.\nWarp: white and pink wool, S-twist\nWeft: light brown, black, light blue, red, white, pink wool, Z-twist.",
