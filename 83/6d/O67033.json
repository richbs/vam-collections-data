The tiles had previously been exhibited in the Great Exhibition, 1851.\nIt is not known when the tiles were removed from their original frame, nor their exact arrangement within it. However, by comparison with other frames in the series, it is likely that the tiles would have been mounted in a frame of six tiles in a 3x2 formation, with these four tiles in a block, the frame being completed by another of the designs unnaccounted for in any of the known frames. This is likely to have been a design for which only two tiles are present in the collection (namely C.76, 93 or 95-1998).",
