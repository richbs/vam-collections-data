Full Citation: \n \n\"<b>72 A Woman, said to be Mrs Fairfax</b>\n<b>1650</b> \nP19-1941  \n \n<b>Oval 48 x 39 mm</b> \n\nFeatures in free, wiry hatches of brown and sanguine, with some blue-grey and pale gouache heightening, on a pale creamy carnation ground; hair in pale brown wash, hatched in darker colour with some touches of gouache; dress a blue wash, modelled in darker colour and heightened with white; the necklace in grey with white highlights; the background a plain brown wash formerly enclosed in a gold margin; on vellum put down on a leaf from a table-book. \n\n<b>Condition:</b> The flesh faded; the edges cropped with the loss of gold margin except in upper and lower edges.  \n \n<b>Signed:</b> In gold,lower left centre: <i>S.C./1650.</i>  \n \n<b>Frame:</b> Late nineteenth- or early twentieth-century silver-gilt oval locket, the convex back and rounded sides curving round to the bezel, then turned over the convex glass; the hanger of elongated tear-drop form of D-section, made from two wires soldered together and bifurcating into tapering spirals of five turns. Cf also Cat. Nos 65, 80 and 94, all re- framed by the Josephs.  \n \n<b>Provenance:</b> S S Joseph Collection; presented by Mrs Emma Joseph, May 1941. According to Williamson, 'almost all' the best miniatures in the collection formed by the Josephs came from the Wertheimers, especially from Samson Wertheimer.(1) \n \n<b>Exhibited:</b> Grafton Galleries, 1894 (unnumbered).  \n \n<b>Literature:</b> Foskett 1974, p. 112; <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 10.   \n \nThe designation 'Mrs Fairfax', which is likely to have arisen in the trade, since no Fairfax family provenance was recorded by the Josephs, does not adequately specify any of the large and complicated Fairfax clan in the mid-seventeenth century, so discussion would be pointless.  \n \nAlthough the Josephs must have acquired it before 1894, the miniature seems to have been little known before it came to the V&A in 1941. It is, for example, one of the very few first-rate Coopers that do not appear in Foster's <i>Alphabetical List</i>.
