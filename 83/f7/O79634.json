In the Syrian region, which incorporated much of Palestine, Jordan and Lebanon as well as Syria itself in the 19th century, they were worn by all sections of society, from townswomen to the nomadic Bedouin of the desert.  The designs vary by sector and show influences from a wide area, reflecting Syria\u2019s strong trading traditions and central location.\n\nPenannular bracelets were usually worn by the Bedouin, but this example is more typical of the jewellery worn by settled women.  The use of bands of twisted wire is very common in Syrian traditional jewellery.  It was bought for five shillings and sixpence (the pair) at the International Exhibition, London, in 1872.  Its name was recorded as \u2018ussuar\u2019, which is a generic Arabic name for bracelets in the region.",
