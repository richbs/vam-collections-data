The furnishing of the study was indeed one of the most important tasks of bronze casting.\n\nBronzes statuettes of this kind were often housed alongside antique examples by wealthy collectors, and displayed on shelves in their studies, above doorways and other settings.They would also have been handled and admired by their owners.",
