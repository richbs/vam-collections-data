ON or OFF) there will be 256 unique neighbourhood states in total.\n\nThis piece illustrates this proposition as a sixteen by sixteen matrix addressed by four-component indices each counting from zero to fifteen. These indices also multiplex to form the neighbourhood states. This is to say that the \"address\" and the \"content\" are identical or that the piece is self contained and self referential.\n\nThe piece also represents the finite states of a single boundary 2-D cellular automation. The self referentiality of the piece can therefore be considered to include time since all possible past and future states are also included.\n\nVon Neumann's Theory of Self Reproducing Automata, John Horton Conway's Game of Life and The I Ching or Book of Changes have all contributed to the development of this work which is the latest in a series begun in 1976.' \n\n(cit: statement by the artist, 26th May, 1991).",
