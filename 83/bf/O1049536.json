Ph. 310-1982\nGiven by J.L Nevison</i>\n\nThe collodion positive was a less expensive form of photograph than the Daguerreotype, although it was also a unique image, and usually also laterally reversed.  The whitish negative image was backed with black to give the effect of a positive.  Usually this was done with black paint applied to the back of the glass plate, as in this example.  The plate was usually covered in brass matt and cover glass, held together by a brass foil frame.  The mounted plate was supplied in a hanging frame or case similar to those used for Daguerreotypes, although often of inferior quality.  The collodion image usually remains in good condition if protected, although sometimes the edges may be tarnished.  On the other hand, the black backing paint may crack or flake off, giving the impression that the image is damaged.",
