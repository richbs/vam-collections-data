The sideboard is raised on six tapering, square legs with spade feet.  The back edge is fitted with a brass rail between two turned uprights with urn finials. The sideboard shows two drawer-fronts to each side, flanking a longer drawer, but the two to the right together cover a single, deep drawer that is fitted as a cellarette with a raised base cut with six circular recessses for bottles, covered with green woollen cloth, the base beneath painted green to match. The drawers are fitted with brass handles with oval, pierced backplates in the form of wreaths, but holes visible on the inside of the drawers indicate that these are replacements. Beneath the central drawer, the lower edge of the sidboard is fitted with a shaped, arched panel, kerfed at the back.",

            "public_access_description": "Until the eighteenth century particular rooms dedicated to dining were unknown. By the 1790s, however, the fashion for furnishing a room with a permanent table and chairs, and with a sideboard to hold dining equipment, was popular amongst merchants and professional people, as well as amongst the aristocracy, with whom it had originated. The form of sideboards was based on designs of the 1770s for shallow tables flanked by pairs of urns on square pedestal cupboards. The designs of the architect Robert Adam were particularly influential. Very soon, tables, urns and cupboards were combined. Some sideboards were made with cellarets, decorative chests that stood underneath, to hold wine bottles. In this sideboard, the fittings for bottles have been incorporated into a deep drawer on the right-hand side, hidden behind two drawer fronts.  The brass rail along the back would have been hung with a silk curtain to prevent splashes to the wall.\n\nOn loan to Abbot Hall, Kendal.",
