The two hinged lids with dragon head knops enable the incense boat to be opened partially or entirely. The grains would have been taken out with a small spoon and placed in a censer, where they would have been burnt during certain church services to produce fragrant smoke. On one lid is the coat of arms of Anton del Olmet, who either owned or commissioned the piece. The other lid bears the arms of the Carmelite Order (a monastic order).",

The needs of church ritual inspired the production of a range of richly decorated vessels and vestments, crosses and images in the form of altarpieces. Many were made of gold or silver, adorned with enamels or gems, precious materials seen as symbolic of the reverence due to the worship of God. Less wealthy churches used cheaper vessels in copper, brass or pewter.  \n\nThe celebration of Mass was and remains the most important service of the Roman Catholic liturgy. For this the minimum requirements are an altar, a chalice and missal, the book of texts necessary for the Mass. Holy Communion or Eucharist is that part of the Mass in which the people participate in the sacrifice of Christ, by partaking of his body and blood in the consecrated bread and wine, held in the chalice and paten.",
