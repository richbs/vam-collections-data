Exhibited 32 works at the RA between 1819 and 1863 (as an honorary exhibitor, indicating he was an amateur, surprisingly in the light of his long and prolific career), 87 at the BI 1820-67, 22 (including nine watercolours) at the SBA, and several at the watercolour exhibiting societies. Subjects were topographical views in England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, France, Holland and Germany. Died Maddox Street, London Wl, 13 February 1868; studio sales at Christie's 19 March 1869 and 13 April 1870. His sons Archer and Charles H Stanley were also artists. Three watercolours are in the V&A collections. \n\nLIT: <u>Art Journal</u> 1868, p73 (obit); M H Grant <u>Old English Landscape Painters</u> vol 8,1961, pp619-20 \n\n<b>Callander Bridge, Perth shire </b>\n1583-1871 Neg HF969 \nMillboard, 30.2 X 40.6 cm (11 7/8 X 16 ins) \nSigned 'C. R. Stanley' br \nBequeathed by W S Louch 1871 \n\nStanley exhibited Scottish subjects in 1836 and 1844. Callander is about 20 miles north-west of Stirling, in a picturesque location; the bridge was built in 1764. Grant describes the work as a 'pleasant little picture' but 'not an adequate example, even of this modest and moderate painter'. Two watercolours by Stanley were also in the W S Louch Bequest of 1871. \n\nLIT:<u> Grant</u>, p619 \n\n\n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
