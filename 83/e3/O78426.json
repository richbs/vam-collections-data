Catherine of Braganza, Charles's Portuguese wife, had a particular passion for tea and did much to popularise it. Tea was originally drunk in the Chinese manner, weak and without milk, but by the early 18th century sugar and milk were added and small spoons became necessary. After 1740, sets of matching tea spoons started to become available.\n\nSocial Usage\nTea spoons were part of the ritual of the tea table. They could be used to signal to the hostess when the guest had drunk his fill. The Prince of Broglie in 1782 reported that 'I partook of the most excellent tea and I should be even now still drinking it, I believe, if the Ambassador had not charitably notified me at the twelfth cup that I must put my spoon across it when I wished to finish with this sort of warm water'.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThis spoon shows the Hanoverian pattern, which was popular between 1710 and 1760. Until 1760, the end of the stem would curve upwards, in the same direction as the bowl, and spoons were usually laid on the table face down. From 1760 onwards, the stem curves downwards and the spoon is laid face up on the table",
