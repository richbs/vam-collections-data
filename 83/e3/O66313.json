From 1564 to 1567 he worked in Turin as court sculptor to Duke Emanuel-Philibert of Savoy. In 1591, Henry IV appointed him as his Court Sculptor and as such he worked on the interior decoration of the Palais du Louvre, Paris.\nA version of this statuette is documented as decorating the Louvre Palace in 1603. Henry IV commissioned many images of himself for propaganda purposes. The inventory made at Prieur's death in 1611 includes three busts of the King and Queen, together with a 'figure of the late King on horseback with two captives below'. Several versions of the composition exist, including examples in the Mus\u00e9e Henri IV, Pau (formerly Louvre), the Museum f\u00fcr Kunst und Gewerbe, Hamburg and the Herzog Anton Ulrich-Museum, Brunswick.",
