Jewellers followed this tradition, or even took it a step further, by recycling materials to make entirely new creations. With today\u2019s consciousness of global warming and the need to use sustainable materials the jeweller of the future will undoubtedly engage more with recyclables. \n\nIn the 1980s Schm\u00f6lzer made a series of jewellery using cogwheels, production parts and varying mechanisms from watches, as here in this pendant. The watch parts were put together with great thought and intent before creating a face or metaphor. His designs were not led by ideas, it was the quality of the metals that were inspirational.\n\nSepp Schm\u00f6lzer was trained as a goldsmith in Feldkirch (K\u00e4rnten) and after the Second World War studied at the Academy of Fine Arts, in Vienna. He was first interested in graphic design and photography before working as a goldsmith. In the Sixties he became known for his gold jewellery with molten surfaces which formed sculptural effects, landscape associations and unconventional stone settings.",
