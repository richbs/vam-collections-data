A polygonal stone building with sixteen sides, it was designed by the architect Jacques Hittorff (1792-1867) and built in 1841 when it was used as the summer home of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Franconi, the equestrian troupe of the Cirque Olympique. The exterior featured ornamental bas-reliefs of horses' heads reflecting the use of the circus for equestrian performances, the interior was decorated in Moorish style, and stables were attached to the north of the building.\n\nThe poster reflects the contemporary taste for large, colourful lithograph posters such as those being produced in Paris in the 1890s by Henri de Toulouse Lautrec. This poster is by Henry Gray and it features an equestrienne standing on horseback with her robes billowing out around her in imitation of the sensational 'serpentine' dance performed by the American dancer Loie Fuller at the Folies Berg\u00e8re in 1892.",
