They featured prominently at fancy dinner gatherings, where they were the only utensils used. The spoons were placed in ceramic basins with their handles balanced on the side and their bowls floating on top of the sherbet. A guest would drink from the spoon, then place it back in the basin for other guests to use. One spoon might serve for two or three people in this way.\n\nLarge spoons like this one were usually made in two parts, with a long rhomboid handle joined to the bowl-section by a socket. The socket was concealed under a large rosette, as here, to make it appear as if the spoon had been carved from one large piece of wood. Large spoons also had a curved 'buttress' underneath the rosette which braced against the bowl. This added stability and prevented the spoon from breaking under the weight of its load of sherbet.\n\nThis spoon was made in the Iranian town of Abadah. In the period 1800-1900, when this piece was made, the town was famous for its elaborately carved sherbet spoons (\u2018qashuq\u2019) made of pear- and box-wood.",
