The Whitechapel Art Gallery, London:\n\"Designed as part of the furnishing for the TB Sanatorium at Paimio, the chair was produced in alternative versions both with a plain plywood and an upholstered seat. It was in an exhibition of Finnish Design sponsored by the Architectural Review at Fortnum & Mason, London, in November 1933. The seat was of special pressed 3mm plywood, moulded on two different forms. This is the first pliant chair built without rigid or semi-rigid framework: the construction lying not in the stouter plywood of the \u2018wheels\u2019 \u2013 which merely transfer the load at four points like the ratchets of a deck-chair \u2013 but the interior bending tensions of the material forming the seat-back, whose inherent strength resides in the varying thickness of its section. Though buoyant as a spring-cushion the seat-back is virtually unbreakable. The Aalto chair is the result of experiments extending over three years, in which all the plywoods used were made by the designer himself. It is impossible to imagine a more comfortable chair, though it will ultimately be the cheapest.\"\n\nAlvar Aalto: architect, urban designer, born 1898, trained Helsinki College of Technology, own office from 1923 in Jyraskyla, then Turku and Helsinki, founded Artek firm for mass-produced furniture in 1935, Professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1940-49.
