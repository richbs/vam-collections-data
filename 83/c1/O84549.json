The pattern consists of dark squirrels and leaves on a paler background. It is similar to designs on medieval tiles where a dark motif or pattern contrasts with a light background.  The architect William Burges designed it.   He studied medieval designs and used them as inspiration. Metford Warner was director of Jeffrey & Co., who manufactured this piece. He encouraged artists and architects, including William Burges, to design wallpapers for his firm.  Thanks to Warner's efforts, wallpapers appeared in the Fine Arts Exhibition at the Albert Hall, London, for the first time in 1873. This raised the standards of design in the wallpaper industry.",
