He designed for several couturiers, including Elsa Schiaparelli in the 1930s, but notably  for Christian Dior from 1953-63.  He is the only one of Dior's collaborators permitted to have a credit on the final design - 'Christian Dior cr\u00e9e par Roger Vivier' - which is marked inside every shoe.\n\nHe often worked in elaborate and expensive materials including silks, pearls, beads, lace, metal threads and jewels.\n\nThis shoe was given to the V&A by Roger Vivier himself as a good example of his work.",
