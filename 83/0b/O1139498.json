Chapman's work is characterised by strong and fluent lines, not easily achieved when working with the resistant grain of a wood block. \n\nThe print 'Mrs Ogmore Pritchard and Her Two Ghostly Husbands' was inspired by characters in Dylan's Thomas's 'Under Milk Wood', and was her first major work in the medium of wood-engraving.",
