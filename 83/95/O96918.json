Engraved  'LMS STEAMERS' for the London, Midland and Scottish Railway formed in 1923 which ran steamer services to Ireland, Isle of Man and in the Clyde. Many of the smaller railway companies were amalgamated into larger operating units after the First World War. The cruet frame may have been used on a railway steamer from 1904 and re-engraved with the new company's initials. A very similar design for a cruet in the Elkington pattern books, with three condiment trays, is labelled \"Dresser, June 9th 1885.",
