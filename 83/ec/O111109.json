The head, feet and hands of this figure are disproportionately small, and the elongated limbs recall Italian mannerist sculpture of the sixteenth century. Analogous pieces are in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna: Neptune and Amphitrite. The elongated proportions and poses of the figures are closely comparable, and the facial features and beard of the Neptune in Vienna are very similar to those of  Winter. Those in Vienna and the present figure bear some analogies with the reliefs known to be by Leoni in the Bayerisches Nationalmuseum in Munich. The proportions of this figure, with its elongated legs and small head, also bear resemblances to sixteenth-century Italian bronzes, such as those by Alessandro Vittoria. However the extreme elongations seen here are strange, and it is even possible that this is a much later pastiche. If however it is genuine, this ivory may have been one of a group of four representing the four seasons, although if that was the case none of the others is known to survive.",
