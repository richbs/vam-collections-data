He was billed as \u2018The Popular London Actor-Vocalist and Character Impersonator\u2019. It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre. He compiled them in a series of albums.\n\nHerbert Shelley (1871\u20131921) was a writer, actor and composer who regularly appeared in music hall with his own dramatic sketches. He appeared with Wallack\u2019s stock company on Broadway before coming to Great Britain, where he worked with the companies of Osmond Tearle, Charles Wyndham and Arthur Bourchier. One of his most successful sketches was \u2018Hamlet the Harmless\u2019, which he wrote for production at the London Coliseum. He also wrote the book for the opera Melnotte, based on The Lady of Lyons. This was first performed at the Coronet Theatre in London in 1901.",

He appeared with Wallack's stock company on Broadway before coming to England and working with the companies of Osmond Tearle, Charles Wyndham and Arthur Bourchier. One of his most successful sketches was 'Hamlet the Harmless' which he wrote for production at the London Coliseum. He also wrote the opera 'Melnotte', based on 'The Lady of Lyons'. Herbert Shelley was one of the top-line variety artists who took part in Variety Artists' Federation strike of  1907. The caricature comes from the second album of caricatures in a collection of albums owned by the Theatre Museum compiled by the graphic artist George Cooke. It is labelled by the artist 'Geo Cooke HYS BOOKE' and features music hall performers working in the early 20th century.",
