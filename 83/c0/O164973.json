It followed the exploits of International Rescue, an organisation that used technically advanced equipment to help those in need.\n\nOriginal Thunderbirds toys are now highly sought after by collectors. Matchbox began reproducing Thunderbirds merchandise, such as this, in the 1990s to coincide with the revival of the TV show. The Tracy Island playset became so popular in the UK that even the Blue Peter fact sheet detailing how to make your own Island became difficult to obtain.",
