If it sounds unlikely that all the vests and bonnets were Queen Mary's own work, she was an expert needlewoman, and the simplified construction and pinked (rather than stitched) edges of the vest would have very much reduced the time needed to make it. The number of babies in the Home at this time was also likely to be relatively small, as it was a local institution on the point of amalgamating with the Lying-In Hospital to become the larger British Hospital for Mothers and Babies.",
