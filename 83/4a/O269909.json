Along with other British and European artists, Moore was asked by Ascher to design prints for dress fabrics in order to create more exciting textiles than those that had been available during the Second World War. \n\nAt a distance this design reads as broad horizontal bands of alternating colours, yet within each row are outlines of forms within forms, depicted with free, interwining lines and circles, connected with quick dashes and circles that appear to pin the rows together. It was available in at least five colourways; grey and dark pink, grey and orange, grey and yellow, green and purple and black and light pink.\n\nAll known samples of this design were made in rayon. Modifications to the manufacturing process in 1947 meant rayon fabrics could be mass produced, easily dyed and would retain their feel and texture longer. These technological advances made it a particularly modern fabric at the time. Produced from naturally occurring polymers, rayon was neither a natural or competely synthetic material, with the unique capacity to imitate the texture and feel of silk, cotton, linen or wool.",
