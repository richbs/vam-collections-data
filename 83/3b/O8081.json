Like coffee, these fermented black teas were usually drunk with milk or cream and often sweetened with sugar.  In comfortably-off household, afternoon and after-dinner tea and coffee were generally served by the lady of the house in the drawing room.\n\nTime\nChelsea's 'goat-and-bee' jugs are the earliest dated English porcelains.\n\nPeople\nThe jug may have been designed and modelled by Nicholas Sprimont (1716-1771), the manager of the Chelsea porcelain factory. A visitor to England said of Chelsea's earliest years that 'an able French artist' (Sprimont was from a French-speaking part of Flanders) supplies 'or directs the models of everything manufactured there'. Sprimont had earlier worked as a silversmith, and the motif of the two goats, placed parallel, but facing in opposite directions, also occurs on silver bearing his sponsor's (or 'maker's') mark.",

Transferred from the Museum of Practical Geology.\n\nHistorical significance: 'Goat and bee' jugs of this type are amongst the earliest examples of English porcelain. Their asymmetry and their whimsical blending of functional shape with whimsical detail make them good examples of English Rococo. The motif of the the two goats placed parallel but facing in opposite directions, is reminiscent of a silver centrepiece by Nicholas Sprimont of 1747 (V&A Museum Number: M.46-1971). Not all genuine Chelsea 'goat and bee' jugs have the bee. Some few are decorated in underglaze blue and manganese, while many were left white.",
