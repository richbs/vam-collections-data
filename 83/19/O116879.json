The region\u2019s natural gold resources had made the Asante wealthy and court regalia, which included textiles (kente), ivory and gold, reflected high levels of skill and technology. \n\nThis gold ornament in the form of a bird was made using the \u2018lost wax\u2019 method of casting. It has a perforated tang so that it can be attached, possibly to a necklace, sword or item of headwear. Asante ornaments often feature representations of birds, animals, humans or manmade items. Many refer to popular Asante proverbs.",
