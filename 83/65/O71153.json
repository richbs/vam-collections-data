The intricately carved ivory elements demonstrate the exceptional ability of local craftsmen of the bhaskar  caste, who were renowned for their skill at working ivory.   The chairs were probably designed for display at the Exposition Universelle, held in Paris in 1855.  In his important work on ivories, W. Maskell described this suite as an example of exceptionally poor design. He thought 'these astounding specimens' showed ' vulgarity and bad taste' and 'a waste of a valuable and beautiful material'.",
