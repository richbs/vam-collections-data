Studied with BR Haydon, entered the RA Schools 1817 (at the age of 14); won annual prizes of the Royal Society of Arts 1813-17. A precocious and prodigious talent, as both painter and draughtsman, he exhibited - in a long and distinguished career - 179 works at the RA between 1815 and 1873, 94 at the BI 1818-65, and four at the SBA 1826-32. \nSubjects included portraits, but predominantly dealt with animal and human genre, often based in Scotland. Elected ARA 1826 (at the earliest permitted age), RA 1831. Received the patronage of the Russell family, and - most importantly- that of the Royal family, to whom he was Drawing Master, beginning in 1836 with the Duchess of Kent (Queen Victoria's mother); most significantly, he represented in visual form the Queen and Prince Albert's love for the life and landscape of the Scottish Highlands. Together with George IV's celebrated visit to Edinburgh 1822, and the great popularity of Sir Waiter Scott's Waverley novels, Landseer's contribution to the place of Scotland in European culture in the 19th century was considerable. The artist's own popularity was increased by the great number of reproductive prints after his works (Graves alone lists 434 by 126 engravers, see Lit below); his 'Monarch of the Glen' (exh, RA 1851), commissioned by the House of Lords but the cost refused by the House of Commons, was eventually bought by Sir Thomas Dewar and reproduced on his family firm's whisky bottle labels. Also significant was his anthropomorphic treatment of animals, particularly dogs; the <u>Art Journal</u> obituarist stressed that 'his dogs are not mere portraits only, they are thinking, almost rational, creatures, wanting only the gift of speech to hold converse with us'. Knighted 1850; offered PRA 1865, but refused, almost certainly because of his poor physical and mental health. Died London 1 October 1873; buried in St Paul's Cathedral. His studio sale was at Christie's 8-15 May 1874; a commemorative exhibition was held at the RA 1874/5. After the Royal Collection, the V&A possesses the largest holding of Landseer's works; there are a great many drawings and prints as well as the oils catalogued below, principally from the Sheepshanks Gift, one of the artist's most important patrons. \n\nLIT: F G Stephens <u>The Early Works of Sir Edwin Landseer RA</u> 1869; J Dafforne <u>Pictures by Sir Edwin Landseer </u>... 1873; <u>Art Journal </u>1873, p326 (obit); interleaved copy of 1874 RA exhibition catalogue, annotated by C S Mann, with photographs of prints after Landseer, 1874-7,4 vols (National Art Library, V&A); A Graves <u>Catalogue of the Works of the Late Sir Edwin Landseer</u> 1876; C Monkhouse entry in DNB; C Lennie Landseer: Victorian Paragon 1976; R Ormond <u>Sir Edwin Landseer</u> Philadelphia Museum of Art and Tate Gallery exhibition catalogue 1981 (With full bibliography).\n\n<b>The Stone Breaker and His Daughter </b>\n508-1882 Neg 76816 \nPanel, 45.7 X 58.4 cm (18 X 23 ins) \nJones Bequest 1882 \n\nExhibited at the BI in 1830, the work was described by the critic of the <u>Examiner</u>: \n\nThe scene appears to be in Scotland; an old man, seated by the roadside, is cracking stones with a hammer, while an innocent-looking and handsome young girl, with an expression of commiseration, is gazing upon the aged and weather-beaten labourer. The dog at her foot, the pieces of cracked granite, and various other objects, are inimitably painted . \n\nThe subject of the stone breaker and his menial and most poorly-paid job seems to have been a new subject for painters; Ormond notes that Landseer's early treatment of the subject 'evidence his originality in choice and treatment of subject matter'. As Lamboume points out, the road and rail systems in England and Scotland had been transformed by Thomas Telford and John L Macadam (see T Coleman <u>The Railway Navvies </u>1967). Lamboume and Ormond also refer to later representations of the subject by Henry Wall is (exh RA 1858, now Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery) and John Brett (1857, now Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool), and - most famously Gustave Courbet's 'Stone-breakers' (1851, Gemaldegalerie, Dresden, destroyed by enemy action 1945; repr by Lamboume fig 5). \nThe <u>Examiner</u> critic in 1830, and Ormond some 150 years later, refer to the stonebreaker as an old man; Ormond identified the young girl as the grand-daughter of the workman. It seems more likely that the stone breaker is depicted as older than his years, due to the arduous nature of his work. \n\nPROV: Probably commissioned by William Wells, his sale, Chrisrie's 27 \nApril 1860 (12), bought the dealer Wall is \u00a31144, presumably for John Jones, bequeathed by John Jones to the museum 1882. \n\nEXH: BI 1830 (53); <i>Works of the late Sir Edwin Landseer</i> RA 1874 (447); Tate 1982 (33) \n\nENGR: John Bumet 1844; F G Stevenson 1888, as pl 84 of <i>Works of Sir Edwin Landseer</i> RA (first series 1881-93) \n\nLIT: Examiner 1830, p83; <u>Athenaeum</u> 6 February 1830, p76; <u>Art Union</u> 1844, p42;<u> Stephens</u> p73; <u>Graves</u> no 158; <u>Mann </u>11,  pp103-4 (repr), E B Chancellor <u>Walks Among London's Pictures </u>1910, p243; <u>Lennie</u> p63; L Lamboume<u> Sir Edwin Landseer's The Stonebreaker and His Daughter </u>(V&A Masterpieces no 17) 1978; <u>Ormond</u> p76 \n\n\nRonald Parkinson\"\nRichard Ormond, <u>Monarch of the Glen: Landseer in the Highlands</u>.

The theme was a topical one, for since the late 18th century the road system of Great Britain has been transformed by the work of Telford and Macadam, improvements accomplished not with sophisticated modern earth-moving techniques, but by the back breaking labour of stonebreakers and navvies.\n \nLandseer skilfully contrasts the physical exhaustion of the stonebreaker, seated with his ram's horn of snuff beside him and his rough haired terrier for company, with his pretty daughter who has brought him his lunch in a basket. In the distance the smoking chimneys of the crofter's cottage hint at the romantic belief in happy domesticity in rural poverty, extolled by Robert Burns in such lines as\n \n                          <i>'The honest man, though e'er so poor, \n                          Is King o'men for a'that.'</i> \n\nThe subject of stonebreaking - manual labour at its most exhausting - was used later by the Pre-Raphaelite painters John Brett and Henry Wallis, and most notably in France by the romantic realist Gustave Courbet in a controversial work of 1851. Landseer's painting, with its emphatic sentiment, belongs firmly to the older genre tradition, though it might be described as a proto-realist work. As always, the sheer quality of his handling of paint gives much visual pleasure, both in the brilliantly observed still-life painting and the depiction of the stonebreaker himself, which anticipates the portrait studies of Highland ghillies he later painted for Queen Victoria.\n\nLionel Lambourne\"",
