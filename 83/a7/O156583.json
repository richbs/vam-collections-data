            "public_access_description": "The peacock's fan on this comparatively early micromosaic plaque is formed by tesserae of a minuscule size of only 0.2 to 0.25 millimetres and arranged to an astonishing degree of realism. This, combined with the range of colours used, is a remarkable achievement. In addition to the long pieces of glass used for the feathers and background, sickle-shaped tesserae have been used to depict the eyes.\n\nThis bird is not an ornithologically correct portrait of a peacock. On the contrary, the palette of the feathers is enriched, especially with hues of red and yellow. On the left of the bird, and hardly visible to the naked eye, a nest is depicted with only a couple of glass pieces. Above the bird there are three blue areas forming crescent shapes that appear to be part of the original mosaic. It is possible that they symbolise clouds, since one of the many legendary abilities of the peacock is the ability to predict the rain.\n\nThe box itself was made in the so-called \u00e0 cage technique: the rectangular sheets of agate were mounted in a cage-like golden frame, and could be replaced in the workshop without much difficulty. The mosaic plaque was inserted into the sheet of agate used for the top, which was given a golden backing on the inside.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes. Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",

The first micromosaics were created in the 18th century, but it was not until Arthur Gilbert himself became interested in collecting them and invented the term 'micromosaics' that they became known as such. The tesserae are minute pieces cut from thin pieces of glass known as smalti filati, and some of the finest micomosaics can consist of as many as 5,000 tesserae per square inch (ca. 3 by 3cm). By the late 18th century Rome had become central to the production of micromosaics and sold them as souvenirs to wealthy foreigners visiting the city. From small elegant snuffboxes to large monumental tabletops, micromosaics could be used to decorate objects of all shapes and sizes. They could even be made to resemble full-sized canvas paintings, and indeed Arthur Gilbert himself mistook his very first micromosaic for a painting. When he brought it home to show his wife, he had to convince her that it was not in fact a cracked painting, as she supposed, but a mosaic.",
