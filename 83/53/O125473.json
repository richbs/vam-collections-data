Exhibited 59 works at the RA between 1798 and 1837,114 at the BI 1810-46, and 314 at the SBA 1824-48 of which he was elected a Member in 1825. He shared a London address 1798-1801 with the painter James Warren Childe (1780-1862), presumably his brother. Grant comments that the single small work in the V&A, and the four lines accorded it in the museum catalogue, were 'poor enough reward for a life's work unequalled, we believe, in volume by any known painter of our School'. Grant also states that his forte was 'small and highly finished rustic intimacies', presumably judging from 'The Cottage Yard' of 1820, which he illustrates (fig 504). \n\nLIT: \tM H Grant <i>Old English Landscape Painters</i> vol 6, 1961, pp486-8 \n\n<b>Moonlight - A Composition</b> \n1388-1869 Neg HF959 \nPanel, 22.2 x 17.2 cm (8\u00be x 6\u00be ins) \nTownshend Bequest 1869 \n\nChilde seems to have favoured moonlight scenes later in his career, exhibiting seven at the RA 1830-37, and many at the BI and the SBA from the mid-1820s onwards. Grant describes the present work as 'nothing more than one of Childe's frequent adaptations from the manner of J B Crome, whose rather washy and unsubstantial \"Moonlights\" ... were much considered at the time when Childe was at work'. He also opines that Childe produced such pastiches to loosen the characteristic tightness of his own style, which is possible, but seems unlikely in view of their frequency of production and public exhibition.\"",
