The two figures are depicted side by side in the drawing but appear to be on opposite ends in the final poster.  The figure on the right hand-side of the lithograph is generally identified as Gazelle while the figure on the left is thought to portray the French can-can dancer Jane Avril, made famous by the artist. \n\nThe final poster was commissioned by Jane Avril, a friend and common subject of Lautrec, to advertise the group\u2019s appearance at the Palace Theatre in London, as apart of their English tour.  From left to right, the poster depicts Jane Avril, Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre, Eglantine Demay, and Gazelle, which is the reverse of the order that Jane Avril suggested in her letter to Lautrec while commissioning the poster.\n\nE.732-1980 was one of several other preparatory studies for the poster, including a photograph of the four dancers (<i>Troupe de Mademoiselle Eglantine</i>, c. 1896, Mus\u00e9e Toulouse-Lautrec, Albi), and an oil sketch titled <i>Etude pour \u2018La troupe de Mademoiselle Eglantine</i> (1896, Private collection). The indentations on the left edge of the paper indicate that it was once bound, and was subsequently removed from a sketch book.  \n\nToulouse-Lautrec is best known for his output of posters, made possible through a long process of study and thought, commonly involving drawings and painted studies on cardboard. His recurring thematic is the depiction of the Parisian life, particularly cabaret and brothel scenes. Sometimes classified as Post-Impressionist, Lautrec had the most influential impact of the aesthetic of poster art.",
