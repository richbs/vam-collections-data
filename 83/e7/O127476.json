Victor was like his more famous brother, Jules Dupr\u00e9, one of the leading members of the Barbizon school. \nThe present painting depicts a hilly landscape with a pond from which cows are drinking. The luminous palette, free and broken brushwork are characteristic of the Barbizon painters who were looking for the rendering of light in <i>plein air</i>.\nParticularly interesting here is the vertical format and the bright light of the white clouds reflecting onto the surface of the pond. The cows appear however formless and more suggested than defined, their large bodies merging somehow with the scenery around them.\nDupr\u00e9 often peopled his compositions with cows in a style reminiscent of the 17th-century Dutch landscape paintings. The influence of 17th-century Dutch painting on the realist and Barbizon painters was quite vivid at the time. \nVictor Dupr\u00e9's art is characterised by a sense of great calm and peacefulness, which can be found in other examples of his work: for instance a <i>Landscape with cows and figures</i> in the Bowes Museum, County Durham, and a <i>Paysage du Berri</i>, Mus\u00e9e du paysage, Saint-Benoit-du-Sault. \nThis painting was bought by the Rev. Townshend and displayed in his villa in Lausanne (Switzerland). It completed there a large collection of 19th-century landscapes paintings and it is not unlikely that he knew personally the artist.",

            "historical_context_note": "19th-century French art is marked by a succession of movements based on a more or less close relationship with nature. At the beginning of the century, Romantic artists were fascinated by nature they interpreted as a mirror of the mind. They investigated human nature and personality, the folk culture, the national and ethnic origins, the medieval era, the exotic, the remote, the mysterious and the occult. This movement was heralded in France by such painter as Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix (1798-1863). In its opposition to academic art and its demand for a modern style Realism continued the aims of the Romantics. They assumed that reality could be perceived without distortion or idealization, and sought after a mean to combine the perception of the individual with objectivity. This reaction in French painting against the Grand Manner is well represented by Gustave Courbet (1819-1877) who wrote a 'Manifesto of Realism', entitled <i>Le R\u00e9alisme</i> published in Paris in 1855. These ideas were challenged by the group of the Barbizon painters, who formed a recognizable school from the early 1830s to the 1870s and developed a free, broad and rough technique. They were mainly concerned by landscape painting and the rendering of light. The works of Narcisse Virgile Diaz de la Pe\u00f1a (1807-1876), Jules Dupr\u00e9 (1811-1889), Th\u00e9odore Rousseau (1812-1867), Constant Troyon (1810-1865) and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet (1814-1875) anticipate somehow  the <i>plein-air</i> landscapes of the Impressionists.",
