Men often wore these in extravagant quantities with traditional costume.  In the south of Germany they also wore decorative filigree hat buckles.\n\nMen's hats in south Germany traditionally had a wide brim and high crown.  The owner added a broad ribbon round the base of the crown, fastened at the side with a silver filigree buckle, like this one.  It would originally have had a prong attached to the centre bar to fasten it.  The mark on the bar is illegible, but it was probably made in Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd, a little town in south Germany which specialised in small filigree work of all kinds in the 19th century.\n\nIt was bought for six shillings and ten pence at the International Exhibition, London, 1872.",
