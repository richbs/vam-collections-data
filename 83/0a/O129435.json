It has a birch frame with laminated plywood seat and back. Aalto's furniture was manufactured in Turku in Finland and this model featured in the 1929 Turku 7th Centenary Exhibition. A year later it appeared in the Minimum Apartment Exhibition in Helsinki.\n\nAalto\u2019s furniture was imported into Britain by the company Finmar. This company was founded in 1934 by Philip Morton Shand and Geoffrey Boumphrey following the success of an exhibition of Aalto furniture that they had arranged the previous year. It was sold to progressive furniture retailers such as Heal's and Bowman's and was used in both domestic and public buildings.",
