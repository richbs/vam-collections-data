The costume has a fitted pointed bodice and short sleeves turned back and held with a 'jewel', extending into long hanging 'sleeves' over inner lace frills; the v-neck is filled with a small modesty frill.  The open-fronted skirt extends into a long train at the back and it and the full-length underskirt is frilled at the hem.  The whole costume is decorated with elaborate scrolled foliage and stylized flowers set with 'jewels'; down the sleeves, bodice, neck and around the upper overskirt to the frill are decorative braid 'bars'.

Eventually numbering 145 items, some of which had belonged to the ballerina Anna Pavlova, it was one of the first and most important specialist collections in private hands.  \nRambert bought the first print as a wedding present but could not bear to give it away.  As the collection grew, it was displayed in the bar of the Mercury Theatre, the headquarters of Ballet Rambert, but in 1968, Rambert gave the collection to the Victoria and Albert Museum; seven duplicates were returned to Rambert, but these are catalogued in Ivor Guest\u2019s A Gallery of Romantic Ballet, which was published before the collection came to the V&A.  Although often referred to as a collection of Romantic Ballet prints, there are also important engravings of 17th and 18th century performers, as well as lithographs from the later 19th century, by which time the great days of the ballet in London and Paris were over.\n\nAlthough the print identifies the subject as Marthe Le Rochais, this is a misprint for Marie Le Rochais, who was born in the mid 17th century and was star at the Paris Opera in the 1680s and 1690s.",
