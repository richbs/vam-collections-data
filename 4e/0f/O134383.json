London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, p. 113, cat. no. 126\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\nFlorentine School, late 17th or early 18th century \n\n126 \nTHE ADORATION OF THE SHEPHERDS \nOil on marble, laid on slate, with a surround of black varnished slate \n7 1/4 x 10 5/8 (18.4 x 27) \nInscribed on back<i> ... marmo ... Fiorentino</i> \nP.22-1962 \n\nThe material on which this has been painted is a mottled marble found in the Valley of the Arno and hence called pietra d'Arno or paesina (landscape stone). As is customary with paintings on stone, the natural configuration of the marble has been incorporated into the composition. The figures are painted, but most of the landscape is made up of the markings of the stone. These paintings, it was said, were 'made by nature, helped by the brush.' Their invention was attributed in 1530 to the Venetian Sebastiano del Piombo and they were popular particularly in North Italy and in Florence in the late 16th and 17th centuries (M. Chiarini, 'Pittura su pietra' in <i>Antichit\u00e0 Viva</i>, ix (2), Firenze, 1970, pp. 29-37, esp. fig. 2; L. Bartoli and E. A. Maser, <i>Il Museo dell'Opificio delle Pietre Dure di Firenze</i>, 1955, pp. 25 f., 44). For other paintings on stone in the Museum see under Rottenhammer, M.179-1960 (no. 307); South German school, 524-1872 (no. 143) and P.8-1956 (no. 145). \n\nCondition. The stone is cracked in several places. \nProv. Capt. F. H. Huth, sold Christie's, 25 Feb. 1916, lot 116/2 (as 'Fiorentino'), bought Bethel; 1923, Mrs Carswell; Archdeacon F. H. D. Smythe; given to the Museum of Art, Hove; given to the Museum in 1962.\n<u>Victoria & Albert Museum Department of Prints and Drawings and Department of Paintings, Accessions 1962</u>. London: HMSO, 1964.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows: \n \n\"<b>ANONYMOUS: Florentine School.
