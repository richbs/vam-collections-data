At the age of 27 years he was appointed to discharge the function of the Sacred Ministry in the populous town of Manchester, where by an unremitted attention to his arduous duties and by that benevolent disposition which induced him to take an active part in the support of every institution whose object was to comfort and relieve the afflicted class of his fellow creatures he shortly won the affections of his Flock and the esteem of all who knew him.  During the course of 42 years the increase of his fame kept pace with  his growing Virtues, but the last effect of his zeal and the climax of his glory was the Erection of St. Augustines Chapel, which in 21 days after its completion became his Monument.
