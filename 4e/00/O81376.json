He participated to the first 'Salon des Refus\u00e9s', which took place in Fran\u00e7ois Bonvin's (1817-1887) atelier in 1859, where he befriended Corot. He had a short career and died at the early age of 37. A retrospective exhibition of his oeuvre took place at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in 1876.\n\nThis is a fine example of Guillaume R\u00e9gamey art he devoted almost entirely to the depiction of horses and horsemen. This painting shows three Arab cavaliers descending a declivity in the desert and a man on foot driving two laden mules. The bright light and subject matter is characteristic of the Orientalist movement, a 19th-century phenomenon, which pervaded French art by combining elements of Romanticism (such as the attraction to distant and Middle East settings) and Realism in the objective rendering of the figures.",

            "history_note": "Commissioned by Constantine Alexander Ionides from the artist. Titled &lt;u&gt;Spahis&lt;u/&gt;, it entered Ionides' collection after October 1873 (cf. letters dated March to October 1873, private collection); listed in Ionides' inventory of November 1881 as 'Cavaliers Arabes' by Regamey, with a valuation of \u00a3100; bequeathed by Constantine Alexander Ionides, 1900.\n\nHistorical significance: This painting shows three Arab horsemen descending a declivity in the desert. Such cavalry were known as <i>spahi, </i>and were also found in French colonial regiments. They were a common theme in R\u00e9gamey's oeuvre, which principally comprised depictions of horses and horsemen. He does not seem to have visited Africa, but made many sketches of Arab horsemen, probably after other artists' designs. His visual memory was said to be considerable and enabled him to recreate details and compositional formulae in his atelier.\n\nThis painting was commissioned by Constantine Alexander Ionides from the artist, whom he had probably met through the intermediary of Legros during the winter 1870-71. At that time, R\u00e9gamey was contributing to the <i>Illustrated London News</i>. Although the painting is signed and dated 1871, letters from the artist in Paris to Constantine Alexander Ionides dated between March and October 1873 (private collection) suggest that it was still unfinished in October 1873. \n\nR\u00e9gamey made at least two preparatory studies for this painting: a sketch in pastel in the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris, (RF29262) dated 14th March 1871 and another in pen and ink, Mus\u00e9e du Louvre (RF 29273).",

            "historical_context_note": "19th-century French art is marked by a succession of movements based on a more or less close relationship with nature. At the beginning of the century, Romantic artists were fascinated by nature they interpreted as a mirror of the mind. They investigated human nature and personality, the folk culture, the national and ethnic origins, the medieval era, the exotic, the remote, the mysterious and the occult. This movement was heralded in France by such painter as Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix (1798-1863). In its opposition to academic art and its demand for a modern style Realism continued the aims of the Romantics. They assumed that reality could be perceived without distortion or idealization, and sought after a mean to combine the perception of the individual with objectivity. This reaction in French painting against the Grand Manner is well represented by Gustave Courbet (1819-1877) who wrote a 'Manifesto of Realism', entitled <i>Le R\u00e9alisme</i> published in Paris in 1855. These ideas were challenged by the group of the Barbizon painters, who formed a recognizable school from the early 1830s to the 1870s and developed a free, broad and rough technique. They were mainly concerned by landscape painting and the rendering of light. The works of Narcisse Virgile Diaz de la Pe\u00f1a (1807-1876), Jules Dupr\u00e9 (1811-1889), Th\u00e9odore Rousseau (1812-1867), Constant Troyon (1810-1865) and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet (1814-1875) anticipate somehow  the <i>plein-air</i> landscapes of the Impressionists.",
