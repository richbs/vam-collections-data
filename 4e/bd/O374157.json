Each segment has a broad base which rises in the centre to a stylised monogram supported by two lions with a crown above.  There is a face below this decorative top.  There are three facetted red pastes, in open-backed toothed mounts, set along the base of each segment, and one above the face, at the base of the monogram.  There are two dish pendants, two leaves, and two stylised crosses hanging from the front of each segment (several missing).  The segments curve outwards, so that the pendants hang clear of the body of the crown.  There is a flat hollow silver figure of a herm, playing pan pipes, between each of the segments of the crown, on top of the hinges which link them together, with a hollow silver cockerel attached at right angles to the head of each herm.  Each cockerel has a pendent leaf hanging from its beak.  Each of the seven segments has two loops on its back, and the seven herms, one, which are threaded on a ring of thick silver wire, with a hook fastening, which holds all the pieces together.  There are two shallow horizontal loops on the outside of the circlet, one at either side, which would have held ribbons.",

In Scandinavia, bridal crowns are the most spectacular part of the wedding jewellery.  Their design is based on medieval royal originals, and they are made of heavy silver, often gilded.  \n\nIn Norway all brides wore some kind of special headdress.  In the south and east of the country it was usually made of cloth or other material, smothered with ribbons, beads and silver appliqu\u00e9s.  Bridal crowns were mainly used in the west of Norway.  They were always expensive.  Some date back to the seventeenth or eighteenth century, and were handed down as heirlooms in wealthy farming families.  Others, like this one, are more recent.  This crown has full silver marks showing that it was made by Lauritz Hammer in Bergen in 1863.  Lauritz Hammer was a silversmith who specialised in making traditional jewellery, as did his father S\u00f8ren, and his son Marius. \n\nThese crowns are full of symbolic values.  The crown itself recalls the crown of the Virgin, and represents purity or virginity.  The lions facing each other above each panel are symbols of strength.  The birds at the top of each hinge are cocks, which are an old symbol of fertility.  The dangling leaves and dish-shaped pendants are typical of Scandinavian jewellery of all kinds, and were intended to deflect evil spirits.",
