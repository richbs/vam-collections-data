Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. Above all they had to have the means of attaching the cord. In this example, there are a pair of holes (himotoshi) on the bottom of the sandal.  Although netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated is the katabori (shape carving). This is a three-dimensional carving, such as this netsuke. \n\nIn Chinese mythology Emma is the King of Hell who passes judgement of the dead. In this netsuke the supposedly terrifying stature of Emma is diminished due to his representation in a bath being washed by two demons.",
