These pediments are supported by Ionic columns.  The quoin on the ground floor is rusticated and on the upper floor ashlar.  On side (ii) of folio 1 is an enlarged detail showing a heavily rusticated doorway.  On Folio 2 side (i) is a detail of the Composite cornice on which the plinths of the upper storey window rest.  Folio 2 side (ii) is a design for a window with a segmental pediment.\n\nThis drawing is part of the Vanbrugh Album from the Library at Elton Hall. The Album contains 254 drawings and includes works by Sir John Vanbrugh, Sir Edward Lovett Pearce, William Talman, Nicholas Hawksmoor, Richard Castle and anonymous draughtsmen in Vanbrugh's office. It was created ca. 1945-54 and was purchased by Victoria and Albert Museum in 1992.",
