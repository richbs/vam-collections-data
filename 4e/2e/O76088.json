But in a book of fashionable designs for furniture published in 1762 they are called simply \u2018Writing or Reading Tables\u2019. The title of the book is Universal System of Household Furniture. It was published by the cabinetmakers William Ince and John Mayhew, who had formed a partnership in 1758. On Plate XXIV they illustrate several alternative designs for carved decoration, although most surviving 18th century writing and reading tables are plain. It is possible that the carved decoration was added to this one in the 1800s.",
