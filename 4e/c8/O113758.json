Before the establishment of banks in the 17th century, chests had also to serve as safes, suitably reinforced with iron straps and formidable locks. This massive chest weighs around 200 kg. and is extremely sturdy. Its three separate locks suggest that it had three key-holders. To open it, a secret catch reveals a dummy hinge strap, revealing three keyholes, one of which releases a long internal bolt.  A further level of security is provided by an internal safe.\n Within the home, a large chest might store clothing and bedding, gold and silver plate and coinage. Institutions and churches also used chests to hold valuables, including documents and parish records.",
