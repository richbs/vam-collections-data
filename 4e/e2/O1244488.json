They presented popular temperance concerts for the working classes, offering an alternative to the public house. Baylis took over the management of the theatre after her aunt\u2019s death. While she was committed to staging affordable theatre, she saw no reason why the local residents shouldn\u2019t enjoy Shakespeare, opera and ballet. Under her management, every Shakespeare play was produced between 1913 and 1923 and she staged operas and ballets at both the Old Vic and Sadler\u2019s Wells Theatre. Her work laid the foundation for the National Theatre and the English National Opera. In 1928 she employed Ninette de Valois, who created the ballet company that would eventually become the Royal Ballet. \n\nIn 1924 Lilian Baylis was awarded an honorary Master\u2019s degree from Oxford University, becoming only the second woman to receive one, and in 1929 she was made a Companion of Honour, in recognition of her service to the nation.",
