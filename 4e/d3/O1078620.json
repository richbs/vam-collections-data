One of the figure drawings is inscribed \"A design for Miss Cummins' Apotheosis\", and others are of scenes or characters in \"The Merry Wives of Windsor (4), and of <i>Tableaux Vivants</i> \"Performed at the Priory in 1802\". The ladies taking part in the <i>tableau</i> included (as indicated in the drawing) Lady Catherine Elizabeth Hamilton (b. 1870, married in 1805, George, 4th Earl of Aberdeen), and Lady Maria Hamilton (b. 1785), daughters of John James, 9th Earl of Abercorn who, in 1802, owned Bentley Priory.\n     62 pp. of wove and (pp. 4, 5 only) laid paper (not all originally part of this volume) in brown calf binding fitted with the lower part of a white metal clasp.\n     <i>Inscribed with ink inside front cover</i> George Shepheard July 8. 1802-9 East S<sup>t</sup> Red Lion Sq<sup>re</sup>, <i>and</i> March 4 1803. S. W for J Forbes Esqr.     <i>On the outside of the front cover us pasted a round label inscribed in ink</i> 1872.\n     <i>Water-colour, pencil, pen-and-ink.     Size of vol.</i> (5 1/4 x 8 1/4).                          E. 11-1934.\n                                                   Given by Mr. J. L. Douthwaite.\n<i>Note.</i> - The \"Queen Dowager\", mentioned above, was Adelaide, widow of William IV. She acquired Bentley Priory from the Hamilton family, and died there in 1849, seven years after the death of George Shepheard. \n          That the Artist kept up his friendship with the Hamiltons is proved by a drawing, in the British Museum, of a design for a title-page with the inscription, \"Dedicated by Permission to the Most Noble, Ann Jane, Marchioness of Abercorn by her most devoted and obliged and humble servant George Shepheard Jany. 1814.\"",
