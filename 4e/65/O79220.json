These clasps come in a small number of basic shapes, including round, as here.  Round Ottoman clasps are never completely circular \u2013 they always have a protrusion, however slight, on the two ends.  The women who owned them sewed them onto cloth belts which they made themselves, usually richly embroidered.  \n\nCypriot clasps are part of the general Ottoman tradition, but are often more sophisticated and decorative than those from elsewhere.  The goldsmiths of Cyprus were famous for their filigree although they rarely marked their work.  This clasp was described as 18th or 19th century when it was acquired, and this may be true.  It was bought in 1888, just after a terrible famine, when many people had to sell their family heirlooms to survive.",
