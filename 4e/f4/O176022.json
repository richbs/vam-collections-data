The seats were generally covered in leather or haircloth (woven horsehair), both of which were durable and water-resistant. The haircloth cover now on this example is modern.  The wood is mahogany, finely carved with a neoclassical anthemion, or honeysuckle motif, in the back-splat, rising from a vase.  The chair can be dated to the 1770s, when the sinuous lines of the mid-18th-century Rococo style were often combined with neoclassical elements.\n\nIt was previously in the Massey-Mainwaring collection. W. F. B. Massey MP (1845-1907) married Isabelle Mainwaring in 1872 and took her surname. Their collection was based on that of her first husband, C. B. Lee Mainwaring, who began collecting in 1820. The Massey-Mainwaring collection included jewellery, enamels, stained glass, porcelain, paintings and furniture. Substantial parts of the collection were lent to the South Kensington Museum from 1874 until 1904, after which most of the collection was sold at auction.\n\nCurrently on loan to Valentines Mansion, Redbridge.",
