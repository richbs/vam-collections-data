The swirling chiffon minidress with huge bell sleeves could have come from a young person's boutique off King's Road in London. However, Heim knew that his clients would not wear sheer dresses without an underdress. The satin underdress in the same print renders the design acceptable to a slightly more conservative clientele.\n\nJacques Heim launched his couture business in the 1920s. In the 1940s he was one of the first couturiers to sell ready-to-wear clothing in boutiques. In 1957, Heim struck a deal with the London manufacturer R.L.Salmon Ltd. They bought the exclusive rights to reproduce Jacques Heim's Paris collections for a British audience. Twice a year, the couture house sent them sketches and materials for Spring or Autumn collections. The final results were approved by Heim before the clothes were sold by high end London boutiques.",
