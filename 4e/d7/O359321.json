            "public_access_description": "The parasol was a popular accessory during the 19th and early 20th century, a period when sun tanned skin was highly undesirable. It functioned both as a sunshade and a fashionable accompaniment to dress, distinguishing itself from the umbrella through its infinite and luxurious forms and essentially feminine status. Like the earlier trend for fans parasols displayed an individual's style and could be used in a coquettish ritual to hide the modest bearer from unwanted glances\n\nSmaller folding parasols for open carriage rides were introduced in 1836 and remained the most popular form for the next 35 years. This example is made by Paris firm Cazal, as stamped on the brass runner, and has a hinged top allowing the cover to be angled towards the sun. It also features the patented Cazal sprung lever a novel variation on the usual opening mechanism. The ivory stick is elaborately carved, probably in China and bears the initials CB or possible GB or TB at its end.",
