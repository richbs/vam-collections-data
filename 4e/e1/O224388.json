It is known that Lucy Hardman, sister of John Hardman supervised the vestment making at the Hardman's premises from 1842 to 1848.  Pugin's diaries and accounts mention her frequently. It is known that the Lucy and Winefred Brown worked with Mrs Powell during the latter part of the 1840s so may also have been involved in making the vestments for Ramsgate. Following Pugin's death the church passed to the Benedictine Order who presented the vestments to the Museum in 1989.",
