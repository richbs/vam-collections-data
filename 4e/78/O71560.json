London, V&A Publications, 2001.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows: \n\n\"<b>Augustus Edwin John (1878-1961)</b> \n\n<i>Jacob Epstein</i>, 1905-6 \n\nDuring the first decade of the twentieth century Augustus John was though to epitomize progressive British art; in 1913 a reviewer of the famous New York Armory Show cited him, together with Matisse and Jacob Epstein, as the three great talents of the European avant-garde.  Although his reputation has been overshadowed in recent years by that of his sister Gwen, it has recently revived, and his early work, produced before the First World War, is highly prized. \nWhile a student at the Slade School of Art in London, John was hugely impressed by J. M. Whistler and was also encouraged to study the old masters.  Later in his life he ridiculed young artists who failed to recognize 'the pre-eminence of Rembrandt as a draughtsman'.  Between 1899 and 1906 John produced a spectacular series of portrait etchings of friends and relations, frequently heavily worked, with dynamic line and dramatic lighting.  Many were published in 1906 to accompany a major exhibition of his prints organized by the Chenil Gallery.  They were subsequently catalogued by Campbell Dodgeson, a leading authority on Rembrandt and old master printmakers, who considered that John had a 'power unequalled among English etchers of to-day, of expressing individual character. \nIn 1905 the American sculptor Jacob Epstein (1880-1959) moved from Paris to London where he soon became acquainted with John and other members of the New English Art Club.  At around the same time as the present work John executed a further etching of the sitter a further etching of the sitter, full face, and Epstein returned the complement with a bronze head of the painter's seventh child Romilly.  Notwithstanding their friendship, John was equivocal about Epstein's primitive style, describing a sculpture underway in 1907 as 'a monstrous thing - but of course it has its merits'.  In this portrait the sculptor is depicted glancing sideways, with pursed lips, as though musing, his forehead framed by a dense mass of wiry hair: a self-consciously 'Bohemian' image of a standard-bearer of international modernism.\"",
