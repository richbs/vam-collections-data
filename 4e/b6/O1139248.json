The first one, Star Wars: A New Hope (1977) became the most successful film in history and grossed over $290 million.  It was not only the film that became a success but also the mechandising that was produced along side the film. The films captured the public's imagination and paved the way for the merchandising that accompanies many films today. A whole host of toy figures, spacecrafts and vehicles were available, as well as costumes, stationery, bedroom accessories and slippers.\n\nThis Han Solo figure was produced by Hasbro in 2005.  They brought the company Kenner in 1991 and the rights to continue to produce Star Wars toys.  This particular toy is part of their Force Battlers range.",
