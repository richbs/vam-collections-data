They were used to help ease tight kid gloves so that they would fit over the fingers.  They also helped restore the fingers of the gloves after washing, which made them wrinkled and stiff.  The user would place the pointed end of the glove stretcher into the finger of a glove and then compress the handle together so that the two ends splayed out, hence stretching the kid leather.\n\nTime\nThis example is probably from the latter part of the 19th century as it has a spring mechanism to ease movement. Late 19th-century glove stretchers often had this improvement.\n\nOwnership & Use\nDuring the 19th century the essential mark of a lady was to have small hands and feet.  It was partly for this reason that close-fitting gloves were worn. A well-fitting glove was also an important complement to the tailored appearance of men's clothing.  Glove stretchers therefore became a vital wardrobe accessory as they assisted the wearer in easing their gloves.",
