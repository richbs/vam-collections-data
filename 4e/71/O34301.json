The set accompanied by a fitted brocade-covered box (FE 1:4) with three internal divisions.  The form is that commonly seen on lidded tea bowls/saucers of the late Qing/Republican period.  The stone (not formally identified as yet) is basically jet-black, with numerous inclusions in various colours, with shades of green and pink predominating.  Some inclusions are reminiscent of plum blossoms, hence the name 'plum blossom jade'.  According to Economic daily 8.2.90 the hardness, at Moh 7-7.5, is equivalent to that of jadeite.  The vendor had personal connections with the entrepreneurs behind the factory, and was acting as their agent in attempting to find commercial outlets for the product.  The project is typical of many small craft manufacturing projects set up in the late 1980s to benefit from looser controls on economic planning, supply of labour.  This was particularly so in poorer areas like Henan province, where a decline in state subsidy forced a search for products with hard currency earning potential.",
