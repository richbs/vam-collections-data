The thread was first wound on a shuttle, which was then used to create the series of knots on the thread which formed a narrow trimming like a string of beads. The size of the knot depended upon the thickness of  thread used. The practice was known in Britain from the medieval period, but did not become common until the late 17th century, probably under Dutch influence.\n\nSocial Class\nKnotting was seen as elegant and genteel, and it was practised by ladies of the higher social classes who had leisure time, including those at Court.  William III's wife, Queen Mary, was an ardent knotter, whose preoccupation was noted by Sir Charles Sedley (died 1701):\n\n'For here's a Queen now thanks to God!\nWho when she rides in coach abroad\nIs always knotting threads.'\n\nThe fashion for knotting waned at the end of the 18th century.\n\nMaterials & Design\nShuttles were often exquisitely made in costly materials, as befitted objects made for use in high society. This shuttle is made of finely pierced and cut steel, but ivory, crystal, lacquer, amber, porcelain, tortoiseshell, silver and gold were also employed to make items which could cost as much as two guineas. Shuttles could be given as presents. The society hostess Mrs Mary Delany was presented with a gold shuttle by George III in 1783.",
