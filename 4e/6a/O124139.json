Identical with one of the four allegorical paintings in the Grand Staircase at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. The paintings are unattributed.\n\nUnlike its companion piece 'Africa' (T.208-1969), this tapestry contains a clue to the date of its design. The more prominent flag is that of the Republic of Haiti, recognised by France in 1825. The cartoons are most likely to have been painted shortly after this, during the presidency of Jean-Pierre Boyer under whom the whole island was united from 1822 to 1843. These two tapestries may have been woven later, having cotton warp which was unusual in the first half of the century.",
