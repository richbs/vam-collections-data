ISBN 1851770712.\n'Alf Wallander specialised in delicately wrought porcelain such as on this vase, reflecting the art nouveau style of the time. His work was awarded a grand prix at the international exhibition, Paris, 1900. Samuel (Siegfried) Bing, born in Germany and settled in Paris, was one of the most important retailers selling contemporary design and imported oriental and 'exotic' goods in his shop 'L'Art Nouveau', 22 Rue de Provence. This vase is one of a group of four purchased from Bing by the Museum following the Paris exhibition (see cat. nos. 323, 324, 325) [1695-1900, 1696-1900 and 1697-1900].'",
