An interest in technology and in motion and sound, led him to produce kinetic sculptures, and, eventually, he moved to the University of New Mexico where he developed his interest in the connections between art and science and began making computer drawings.  The University of New Mexico owned an IBM mainframe 1401 computer, and Mattox encouraged other members of the University\u2019s art department to learn how to create computer programs for drawing.  Works such as this print would have been developed by writing the program, which would have been very time consuming, and then transferring it to an IBM punchcard machine.  This actual drawing could then be produced relatively quickly.\n\nThis drawing has been created by using a pen plotter.  Punched cards would have been created from a computer program written by Mattox, that would then have driven a mechanical arm with a pen across the drawing surface.",
