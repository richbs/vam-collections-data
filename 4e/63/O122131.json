The shoulders of the ring are engraved with the letters 'TOT', an abbreviation of the British deity Totatis. A large group of rings engraved with these letters have been found in eastern England, principally Lincolnshire, although this ring is unusual in being set with an intaglio. \n\nTotatis was associated with the Roman god Mars. The number of rings found inscribed with his name suggests that he was an important local tribal deity. The Roman poet Lucan, writing in the first century referred to Totatis as the \u2018dreaded Toutates\u2019.",

A large group of base metal and silver rings with the letters TOT engraved on the bezel have been found in eastern England, principally Lincolnshire (recorded through the Portable Antiquities Scheme). TOT is an abbreviation of the Celtic god Totatis or Toutates who was worshipped in Britain and became associated with the Roman god Mars. \nThe ring is unusual in having the inscription upon the shoulders of the ring rather than the bezel. The bezel is set with a fine quality intaglio of Ganymede. The bezel is also decorated with four small gold pellets. This decoration is very uncommon and so far known on the bezel of two other rings, both also set with hardstone intaglios, one of which was found near Hadrian's Wall. \n\nInformation kindly provided by Ian Marshman of Leicester University, 10 October 2013.",
