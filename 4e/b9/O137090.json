Spermatozoa wriggle in abstracted form from the handle down the blade. The Japanese technique of mokum\u00e9 gan\u00e9 has been used to pattern the silver-copper handle with intricate lacquered design. These organisms spill in thematic concord onto the blade where the spermatozoa become pierced patterns. This bold piece is a unique interpretation of the design brief, alluding to the fundaments of creation in its simple form and repeated design.",
