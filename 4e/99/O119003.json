            "historical_context_note": "This prophet is not dissimilar to the statuettes of weepers and mourners produced in marble and alabaster to adorn aristocratic tombs produced by later artists such as Claus Sluter, but we can be sure this figure was not made for this purpose, since it portrays a prophet not a weeper, and is rather too small. Most importantly, tomb figures were based on a style and example set by altar figures, of which this is a prime example, as those of magnate and princely rank sought to make their tombs appear as grand religious altars to their memory for others to pray to and respect, and come into fashion towards the end of the fourteenth century - in other words more than half a century later than the date of this figure. The style, date, subject and size of the figure is clearly that of a figure from a now lost group decorating the sides of an altar in a church some where around Cologne.",
