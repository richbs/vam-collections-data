Elkington and Company developed a range of enamelled wares based on Japanese designs which were shown at the Paris Exhibition of 1867 and the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition of 1876.  Some of Elkington's enamels are technically quite different from the Japanese originals.  Whereas Japanese enamellers used traditional wire, cloisonn\u00e9 techniques (creating cells with wire to receive enamel) Elkingtons' electroformed their products, complete with cavities for the enamels.  Elkingtons' only produced their enamelled items until about 1880 but continued to import enamels from Japan.",
