Rysbrack's lifesize bust of Elizabeth I served as the model for this smaller relief version of the same subject. Van der Hagen (active London 1744 \u2013  York 1769) worked both in marble and in  ivory. He seems to have concentrated in small ivory heads, some after full-size busts by John  Michaerl Rysbrack (1694-1770). He was aparaently a native of Antwerp, who practised in London for  most of his life. He may be indentical to the monogrammist GVDR. Rysbrack (1694-1770) was born in  Antwerp, and trained in the Netherlands, but spent his working life in Britain. He was one of the most  important sculptors active in this country in the first half of the 18th century, and specialised in portrait  busts and funerary monuments. Although he never visited Italy, many of his works are clearly indebted  to classical archetypes. His terracotta models are particularly fine, and are often virtually finished  pieces in their own right.",
