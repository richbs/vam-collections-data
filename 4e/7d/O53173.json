I agree with him that it is, I suppose, very good of its sort, but I'm obviously getting old and still can't bear the sort myself but that is no reason not to include an example in the Museums [?] group. The craftsmanship is first rate & worthy of a place in our new range of Galleries. It is in the office here if you would care to see it.' (Museum Archive, MA/1/L1298)",
