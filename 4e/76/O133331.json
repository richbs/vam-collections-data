            "public_access_description": "Th\u00e9odore Rousseau (1812-1867) was born in Paris where he trained with his cousin, the landscape painter Alexandre Pau de Saint-Martin (1782\u20131850), and subsequently with Joseph R\u00e9mond (1795\u20131875). In spite of progressively emerging as the leader of the Barbizon school, Rousseau was systematically excluded from the Paris Salon between 1836 and 1841. Between the revolution of 1848 and the early 1860s, Rousseau enjoyed a short period of prosperity with official commissions and was eventually made Officer of the L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur in 1867, a few months before he died.\n\nThis painting is a fine example of Rousseau\u2019s late period when he turned to more finished compositions reminiscent of the 17th-century Dutch landscape painting. This painting departs therefore from his most famous free and broad manner associated with the school of Barbizon. It belongs however to his most productive and successful phase, which began after the revolution of 1848 and ended in the early 1860s.",

He began painting from nature during excursions in the environs of Paris, including Fontainebleau, from 1826 to 1829. From 1831 to 1836 he exhibited at the Salon, but the naturalism of his landscapes made him the most controversial figure of his time and the consistent refusal of the Salon to accept any of his work between 1837 and 1848 earned him the title of <i>Le Grand Refuse</i>. From about 1837 he went to Barbizon nearly every year and became the central figure of the group of painters associated with that place, but public recognition came only with the Revolution of 1848 and the first class medal awarded by the free jury of the 1849 Salon. \n\nLit.

Townshend; by whom bequeathed to the museum in 1868.\n\nHistorical significance: This painting is a fine example of Rousseau's late period and belongs to a phase of prosperity and success. It depicts a flat landscape with a few trees growing by a pond. The landscape here does not correspond to a depiction of the Landes region in France, which is dominated by large dunes and forests of conifers. The cool palette, more finished execution of the trees and figures, and shimmering sunset light is reminiscent of the art of the 17th-century Dutch landscape painters. \nThis painting was probably not made in <i>plein-air</i> but executed in the artist's studio. A few similar compositions date from the same period and show the same technical approach as in the present painting (See <i>The Pond</i>, Metropolitan Museum, New York - Inv. 1975.1.201 and <i>pond with cows</i> Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts, Moscow - Inv. 1090).\nRousseau was greatly influenced by the Dutch painters, especially Jacob van Ruisdael (1628/29-1682) and Jan van Goyen (1596-1656), of whom he bought a painting jointly with Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet. Rousseau also owned some 50 prints of Dutch paintings, including copies of works by Jacob van Ruisdael. Rousseau improved his knowledge of Dutch art by copying Adriaen van de Velde  (1636-1672) and Karel Dujardin's (1626-1678) paintings in the Louvre.",

            "historical_context_note": "19th-century French art is marked by a succession of movements based on a more or less close relationship with nature. At the beginning of the century, Romantic artists were fascinated by nature they interpreted as a mirror of the mind. They investigated human nature and personality, the folk culture, the national and ethnic origins, the medieval era, the exotic, the remote, the mysterious and the occult. This movement was heralded in France by such painter as Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix (1798-1863). In its opposition to academic art and its demand for a modern style Realism continued the aims of the Romantics. They assumed that reality could be perceived without distortion or idealization, and sought after a mean to combine the perception of the individual with objectivity. This reaction in French painting against the Grand Manner is well represented by Gustave Courbet (1819-1877) who wrote a 'Manifesto of Realism', entitled <i>Le R\u00e9alisme</i> published in Paris in 1855. These ideas were challenged by the group of the Barbizon painters, who formed a recognizable school from the early 1830s to the 1870s and developed a free, broad and rough technique. They were mainly concerned by landscape painting and the rendering of light. The works of Narcisse Virgile Diaz de la Pe\u00f1a (1807-1876), Jules Dupr\u00e9 (1811-1889), Th\u00e9odore Rousseau (1812-1867), Constant Troyon (1810-1865) and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet (1814-1875) anticipate somehow  the <i>plein-air</i> landscapes of the Impressionists.",
