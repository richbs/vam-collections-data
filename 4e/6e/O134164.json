Studied at Sass's art school and the RA Schools. Painted portraits, literary and historical subjects, domestic genre (often in historical costume), and rural genre scenes. Exhibited 121 works at the RA between 1839 and 1896, and 11 at the BI 1837-50. Elected ARA 1855, RA 1864. Won prizes in the competitions for the decoration of the Palace of Westminster 1843, 1844 and 1847. Some of his works were engraved; he also contributed etchings to the publications of the Etching Club and drawings to <i>Punch</i>, and in 1843 designed the first Christmas card. Associated with the artist's colony at Cranbrook, Kent, where he bought a house in 1858. At the RA, he was Rector 1875-90 (his campaign against the use of naked models in life classes earned him the soubriquet 'Clothes-Horsley'), Treasurer 1882-97, and initiator and organiser of the first Winter Exhibitions of old masters. Died Kensington, 18 October 1903. The painter Walter Charles and architect Gerald Callcott were his sons. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1857, pp181-4; <i>Illustrated London News</i> 24 October 1903, p608 (obit with photograph); J C Horsley <i>Recollections of a Royal Academican</i> 1903 (referred to below as <i>Recollections</i>); A Greg <i>The Cranbrook Colony</i> exhibition catalogue Wolverhampton Art Gallery 1977 \n\n<b>Waiting for an Answer</b> \nFA82 \nPanel, 41.9 x 55.9 cm (16\u00bd x 22 ins) \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nExhibited at the BI in 1841, the size given in the catalogue as 24 by 30 inches (including the frame, as was usual). \n\nThe Departmental MS <i>Register</i> describes the subject: 'A retainer while waiting for answer to his master's billet doux to the lady of the mansion is waiting the reply to his own love making to my lady's maid. The picture is very carefully completed in all its details'. \n\nThe <i>Athenaeum</i> critic described it as 'a cabinet picture, like all his works, delicate, refined, and attractive, -like all of them, stiff and incorrect in its drawing. It is high time this should be amended'. The man's figure was considered 'thoroughly wrong'. \n\nThe background setting is the garden door at Haddon Hall, Derbyshire, where Horsley first visited and made drawings in about 1835 (see 'The Rival Performers', below). Another version of the subject was sold at Christie's 12 June 1985 (104, signed and dated 1866, canvas 42 x 59 cm) possibly exhibited at the RA 1866 (251); another was sold at Christie's 14 February 1986 (73, signed and dated 1866, 70.5 x 96.5 cm). \n\nEXH: BI 1841 (7) \n\nLlT: <i>Athenaeum</i> 6 February 1841, pp117-8\"",
