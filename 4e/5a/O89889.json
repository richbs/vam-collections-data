            "physical_description": "Painting, in opaque watercolour and gold on paper, the scene appears to be that of a court judgement with the judge seated in a pavilion above two groups of petitioners with babies.  It probably depicts an episode from the story of the Judgement of Solomon, known as Sulayman in the Islamic world The central principal man in a white turban with a white beard holds a book and is kneeling against a large bolster.  He is in discussion with another younger turbaned man on his right while one servant fans him from behind and another squats to his left holding a small glass with two flasks in front of him.  Three men with the middle one holding a baby on the left make up one of the two petitioning groups, while the other on the right side consists of a squatting woman with a standing woman holding another baby behind to the side of an old man bowed and resting his head on a long stick.  A younger bearded man on his right gesticulates and turns his head towards him.\n   The polygonal pink pavilion is raised upon a carpeted dais with a flight of balustraded steps leading down to the green-tiled foreground where the petitioners are situated.  Behind the principal figure there is a detailed depiction of a doorway within a wall made up of a series of variously shaped niches bearing a mixture of mostly blue and white bowls, dishes and bottles together with some coloured glass ones.  The panels and spandrels round the niches are minutely decorated and include two panels of pairs of birds either side of the top of the door, over which there are panels containing Persian script.  An outer wall behind the pavilion has two open doorways revealing the garden the gnarled trunk of a tree beyond.  Further buildings and trees can be seen above and through the little kiosk which is mounted on the pavilion's flat roof next to a simple green-roofed hut and enclosure to the right.\n   The painting has two inner borders with an outer gold strip.  The inner border is of a blood-red colour and is decorated with a stylised floral scroll in gold over which there are two ruled white lines.  The border next to it is made of marbled blue paper with a different floral scroll also in gold on it.  A turquoise line divides this from the outer gold  band which has two narrow black ruled lines at its outer edge and a further dark blue line.  This last has been added to the page after the main border was decorated as it overlays the decorative motifs.\n   The main border has an ivory ground stencilled with a row of stylised alternate lilies and irises rendered in marbled blue flowers and buds with green mottled  leaves and stems, all defined in gold outlines and hatching.\n   The margins of the page have pinkish-buff-coloured strips of paper added to the top and outer margins with additional fragmentary red and white outlines.  That on the top edge has been repaired with an irregular strip of pinkish paper.  The lower edge also has a later, paler irregular strip of paper with a white outline.  A darker buff strip has been added as a gutter to the page.\n    The main border has a number of smudges of purple and red paint on it.",

It contains 56 leaves on which are Mughal miniature paintings, drawing and flower studies on both sides. The binding is covered with an Indian brocade silk that may have been cut from lengths brought home by the 2nd Lord Clive, who served as Governor of Madras, 1799 to 1803.  The album was sold from Powis Castle at Sotheby's sale, 16 to 18 January 1956, lot 332A.",
