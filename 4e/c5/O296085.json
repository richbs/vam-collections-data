Although filigree buttons were the most typical, many countries used buttons made of sheet metal as well.  Most European cultures disapproved of male jewellery, but buttons allowed men to show off their wealth and status.  They wore them in extravagant numbers, on sleeves and trousers as well as jackets and waistcoats.\n\nThe design of this button, with a stylised four-petal flower engraved on a hollow dome, is very widespread throughout northern Europe, and probably originated in the 17th century.  This one was made in Sk\u00e5ne, in the extreme south of Sweden.  Sk\u00e5ne province has the richest tradition of jewellery, and more was worn there than in any other district.  Almost all the Swedish traditional jewellery at the V&A comes from Sk\u00e5ne.   This button was made in the first half of the 19th century, and has the maker's mark NR.  It is not possible to identify the maker precisely as there were several makers who used that mark in the region at that time.",
