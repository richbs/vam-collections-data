His artistic style developed while at art college in Croydon, where he was influenced by the ideas of the avant-garde political group, the Situationist International. The political slant to his art was aroused by the May 1968 Paris student riots, which inspired fraternal protests organised by Reid at the Croydon College of Art. These were directed with fellow student Malcolm McLaren (1946-2010), later to become the manager of the Sex Pistols.\nReid followed art college by starting his own left-wing small press publisher, Suburban Press, unearthing political intrigue and spreading the ideas of the Situationists through his graphics, employing their ideas of d\u00e9tournement, lettrism and sloganeering.\nD\u00e9tournement, a method using well-known media to create a new work with a different message, is central to Reid\u2019s Sex Pistols work, epitomised in his use of images of the Queen defaced with safety pins and swastikas. Lettrism \u2013 the incorporation of letters, numerals and non-Western calligraphy into painting to fuse art with poetry, is also abundant, as is his use of sloganeering in repeated statements such as \u2018Never Trust a Hippie\u2019, and \u2018Anarchy Is The Key\u2019.",
