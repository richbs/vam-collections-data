The single drawer in the frieze is moulded on the edge with a shallow single line formed with a scratch-stock.  The table has three flaps, opening to two surfaces, the lower with an inset panel of baize, the upper plain. The edges of the upper two flaps are rounded, the edge of the lower cut with a concave moulding which disguises this flap in what appears to be a concave cornice at the top of the plain frieze. The keyhole escutcheon of the drawer is in brass, a plain oval. The bail handle of brass is formed of S-scrolls, with a central rococo cabochon.  The two back plates are attached with circular flat bolts, each with a single cross-cut. They are shaped in outline and pierced, with C-scrolls.\n\nThe rails of the lower frieze frame are tenoned into the uprights. The side panels are thin boards of solid mahogany, fitted into vertical grooves in the uprights, the outer faces lying flush with the outer edges of the uprights. The corners are reinforced with vertical glue blocks and drawer guides are glued to the top of the rails. The spandrels at the top of the legs are glued on, the carving continuing across from the legs.  The spandrels are additionally reinforced with glue blocks set behind. The frame if reinforced with a central muntin in beech (stained dark), cut with a dove-tail that fits into the underside of the front rail and with another that is screwed up into the underside of the central knuckle hinge of the gate-leg. The lowest flap is fixed to the top of the frieze frame with screws that run in recesses cut on the inside of the frieze rails. The first and second flaps are hinged with two hinges at the back.  The second and third flaps are joined with scissor hinges.  The drawer has a front of solid mahogany, and sides, back and base of oak.  It is dovetailed, the base (with board set laterally) set into a rebate with fillets of oak set beneath on the front and sides.",
