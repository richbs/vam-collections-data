Their main bodies feature a multi-coloured design of a navy blue background with dragonflies, butterflies and other insects. One shape has two Gecko forms near the top creating a base for a candlestick holder. The other shape has a Gecko form trying to emerge from the base. Both bases are less ornate than the bodies of the objects, and look like roughly hewn pieces of grey fissured rock",

It shows a technically ambitious plan and the intention to work in an intricate manner, because it is influenced by Rich's original training as a jeweller. Using a cloisonn\u00e9 technique that is common in the production of jewellery, the dark blue enamel with multicoloured forms depicts insects in night flight. This cloisonn\u00e9 decoration is achieved by creating sections over the body of the overall shape of the object using silver wire. The sections are then filled with coloured enamels and fired. The filigree wire borders delineate these sections within the design lending a more vivid quality to the enamelling. \n\nNow in the Metalwork collection, these candlesticks were commissioned by the V&A and funded with the assistance of Mrs Rita Gans in memory of her husband Mr Jerry Gans.",
