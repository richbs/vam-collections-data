The tunic is cut long and full at the skirts, has straight sleeves and there is a small opening at the neck. The embroidery consists of a large square panel over the breast, and a long panel (pointed at the top) down the front of the tunic, which with the narrow sleeve cuffs, are all worked with close geometrical and floral sprig patterns in vertical or diagonal rows. There is also a row of cross-shaped devices formed by small rosettes down the length of each sleeve. Stripes of embroidered design surround the waist and edge of the tunic and form pointed compartments at the back. There is a narrow braid edging embroidered in colours at the neck. There is a cotton panel at the back of the tunic with a variegated silk insertion of Central Asian characters at the armpits.",

The pocket is embroidered in the same designs as the two front panels of the pashk, while the rest of the dress has very little ornamentation.  The back of the dress is made of a coarser, more durable fabric than the fine silk or cotton used for the main part of the garment.  It may seem very impractical to have a single huge pocket in which one's possessions are indiscriminately jumbled together, and this does lead to considerable rummaging on the part of the wearer.  Money and small items such as keys are usually carried in a more accessible manner, tied up separately in a small bundle at the waist or knotted into a corner of the wearer's headcovering.",
