The neck is square and low fastening with a draw string behind. The waist, with inserted band, is medium high. The skirt is gathered slightly at the centre front and more extensively at the back. It flares and is finished at the hem with a cord edged gathered frill and headed by a gathered applied puffed band of white muslin and a cord headed tuck. The sleeves are long, and wider on the upper arm, and gathered at the shoulder. There is an applied band at the wrist which fastens with a hook-and-eye. The bodice is unlined and there is a flat metal hook-and-eye at the waist to fasten. There was a pocket opening in the right side seam of the skirt, which has been ripped almost to the hem.",
