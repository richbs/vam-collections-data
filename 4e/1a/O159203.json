Ginger is best known for her topographical landscapes in watercolours of British scenes painted as part of the Pilgrim Trust's 'Recording Britain' project, started in 1939 with the purpose of recording aspects of British landscape that might be destroyed and lost under enemy bombing. However, her first ambition was to become an illustrator. She was a prolific book illustrator and designer of book covers for publishers such as Puffin, JM Dent and the magazine Harper's Bazaar, as well as pictorial adverisements. Portraiture, especially of her own family (she had married silversmith Leslie Durbin in 1940) was to occupy her especially in her later years.",
