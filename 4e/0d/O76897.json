Within the roundel two rampant, addorsed winged human-headed lionesses, turning their heads to face the spectator, are moulded in low relief.\n\nOn the back of the mirror, graffiti was engraved at an early point in the object's history.  It features a seated ruler who wears a three-pointed crown. In his left hand he holds an unindentified object (a knife?) against his chest and in his out-stretched right hand holds a sword or staff (?). He is seated  cross-legged on a low dais between two poles.  Single words, star and morning, are written twice.  A rectangle encloses three Stars of Solomon and two, possibly  astrological, sketches - the signs of Leo and of Scorpio?  Additionally, there is an eight-line chart of astrological signs and the word 'amal (deed or work).  Further letters may read be read as a name, Hamu[d].  Finally, there is an astrological triangle of signs and some individual letters, which to date have not be interpretated.\n\nPatina: Blackish olive patina on moulded face; dark brown with a touch of red oxide on polished face. The edge of the rim scraped with sand or brick dust, effectively removing the dark olive patina on two-thirds of the circumference.",
