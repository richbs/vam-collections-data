Moses can be seen in the background descending from Mount Sinai and about to throw down the Tablets on which the Commandments were written.\nThe figures in the foreground appear to have been modelled separately in the clay and applied to the low-relief background before firing. The area around Bologna was a source of good quality clay and the city therefore became an important centre for terracotta sculpture. \nAgostino Corsini (1688-1772) worked in his native Bologna and also in Rome, where he made the figure of Abundance for the Trevi Fountain (1735). He worked in the style of late Baroque Classicism, and later in the Roccoco style. From his earlier work in Bologna little survives. He moved to Rome in the 1730s where he worked on decorative sculptures for various architectural sites.",
