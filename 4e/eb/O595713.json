            "history_note": "This illustration clearly illustrates how rapidly fashions changed in the year 1889. It would have been completed in August 1889 for a deadline of 1 September 1889. By the time of publication in December that year, the large bustles on the ballgowns would have appeared a little less fashionable than they had a few months earlier, as skirts were undergoing a relatively swift deflation. Du Maurier was very fashion-conscious and his illustrations show great awareness of the most modish styles of the day, often using the subject of fashion as a joke. One well-known example is the late 1870s <i>Punch</i> cartoon \"Veto\" with the slogan \"I should like to [sit down], but my dressmaker says I mustn't\". Male dress was not immune from du Maurier's satirical eye - 'The New Hussar Hessians and Pants', published in <i>Punch</i>, May 1878, satirises the inability of both the fashionably dressed woman and the military man in stiff dress uniform to stoop to pick up a dropped handkerchief.\n\nThis makes this image particularly interesting, falling as it does during a period of unusually rapid, not particularly gradual fashion change, as it shows Du Maurier keenly observing the extremely elegant and modish appearance of the summer of 1889, which by December that year would have begun to appear slightly d\u00e9mod\u00e9 to the most dedicated followers of fashion who would already have been wearing significantly less draped, more smoothly flowing skirts with smaller, more streamlined bustles. The majority of readers would probably not have noticed anything amiss, however.\n\nDaniel Milford-Cottam, 08/12/2011.",
