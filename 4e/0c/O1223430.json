Tea sets for children go back to the sixteenth century, when they were generally made in Germany, of pewter or copper. Faience (fine, tin-glazed earthenware) and porcelain sets appeared in the eighteenth century and were thought of as precious gifts, brought out on special occasions. Ceramic sets became very popular in the early twentieth century, but although children's tea sets are still a popular play item today, since the 1960s they have been mostly made of plastic. \n\nThis set features lines from the childhood nursery rhyme, Who Killed Cock Robin?, with related anthropormorphic birds. The pictures were applied through a process called decalcomania, whereby the images are printed on thin paper and transferred on to the earthenware before the glazing process.",
