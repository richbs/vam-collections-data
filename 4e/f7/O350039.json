The swags of fruit, combined with the classical herms recall the work of the Renaissance architect and designer Inigo Jones.\nThey were part of an overmantel at Wilton House, Wiltshire, and were possibly commissioned by Philip Herbert, 1st Earl of Montgomery and 4th Earl of Pembroke. It is likely that the overmantel was in the South front of Wilton House before this part of the building was destroyed by fire around 1647 or 1648.\n\nThe caryatids closely resemble a drawing for a chimneypiece and overmantel which Inigo Jones designed for Oatlands Palace in Surrey in 1636. The putti heads on the caryatids at Oaklands Place have here been replaced with female ones.\n\nInigo Jones (1573-1652) was one of the first great English architects. He is known primarily for introducing the Palladian style into England from Venice.",
