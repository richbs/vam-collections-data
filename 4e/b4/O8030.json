The two-part dome-shaped stopper is made of green and white jadeite jade and coral.\nThe carved relief depicts a formal design of scrolls and circular motifs enclosed within a key pattern border . The same design is found on the reverse.\nThe unusual formal archaic decoration suggests that this bottle could have been made in the eighteenth century.  How early overlay glass was made is not known; I would not accept the evidence of Zhao Zhiqian (1829-84), quoted by Yang, that he had seen Kangxi overlay snuff bottles (Yang 1987, p.77) but Yang does cite overlay pieces made in the Yongzheng period (1723-1736) mentioned in the Peking palace archives, which would seem to me a more reliable source.\nThe bottle does not have a foot, the base is small, flat, oval and does not stand very safely.",
