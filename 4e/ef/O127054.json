Macdonald commissioned this bust from Chantrey in 1817, and it was completed the following year. Chantrey exhibited a bust of Sir Archibald Macdonald at the Royal Academy in 1820, presumably the present piece. It was bequeathed to the Museum by the British art historian Rupert Gunnis, who specialised in the history of post-medieval British sculpture.\n\nSir Francis Legatt Chantrey (1781-1842) was an English sculptor, painter, and patron. He was probably the most successful portrait sculptor of his day. Together with Flaxman Chantrey can be ranked as England's greatest sculptor engaging in portrait busts and statues. He was particularly skilled in carving drapery. On his death he left a fortune of \u00a3150,000 which was later bequeathed to the Royal Academy to be used for the 'Encouragement of British Fine Art in Painting and Sculpture'.",
