The actual plaster ornament was produced by pressing 'composition' into the mould.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe sphinx was a popular decorative motif used in ancient Egypt, Greece and Rome. However, this particular style of sphinx derives from the Etruscans, a people who colonised Italy around 800 BC. Etruscan archaeological finds aroused great curiosity in the 18th century, and many decorative details were copied and incorporated into Neo-classical schemes.\n\n Materials & Making\nThe mould was made by a specialist carver for firms making composition ornament. Boxwood is very hard and  can take a great deal of detailed carving. Its hardness also makes it robust, necessary for a mould such as this which has been reused countless times.\n\nComposition ('comp' for short) is a type of paste or putty made from glue, rosin (resin), linseed oil and whiting (chalk). It was pressed into the oiled mould and squeezed in a screw press. The pressing was removed from the mould while still flexible and applied to a backing. \n\nTime\nMoulds of this kind were used widely from about 1780 until about 1900. The use of moulds to make plaster reproductions reduced the demand for ornamental carvings in wood. After about 1850 the manufacturing process became more mechanised, though moulds continued to be used.\n\nPeople\nThe mould was part of a collection owned by George Jackson & Sons, Ltd, a firm founded by George Jackson (1756-1840).",
