The artist, Florence Claxton, was a popular caricaturist who worked for many of the leading illustrated journals of her day. This drawing was published as a wood engraving in 'The Queen', an upmarket ladies newspaper, in 1861. It is a unique image of the galleries 'in action' at an early date. \n\nThe piece also parodies contemporary debate over women's art practice. Several stereotypes of the female artist appear. In the background is the strong-minded woman who has been de-feminised by her professional ambition (hers is the largest easel). To the right, two dilettantes wander flirtatiously about the gallery distracting the male students. An article in the 'The Athenaeum' in 1860 had commented that  \"If anyone will visit the South Kensington Museum on what is called a \"Students' day\" he will find the galleries\u2026crowded with men and women, when not engaged in flirting, copying the pictures of that collection\" .",
