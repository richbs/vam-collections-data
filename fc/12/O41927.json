Directed by Simon McBurney; designed by Rae Smith; lighting by Paule Constable; movement by Marcello Magni and music by Gerard McBurney.  The Company comprised Annabel Arden, Lilo Baur, Hayley Carmichael, Antonio Gil Martinez, Joyce Henderson, Eric Mallett, Clive Mendus, Stefan Metz, Cesar Sarachu and Matthew Scurfield.\n\nHistorical significance: The Street of Crocodiles was a production originally created by Th\u00e9atre de Complicit\u00e9 with the National Theatre's Studio and shown to an invited audience in April 1991. After a process of devising, adapting, writing and rehearsal, the production opened at the RNT's Cottesloe Theatre on 13 August 1992.  It is based on the stories of the Polish writer and artist Bruno Schulz who was born in Drohobycz in 1892 and who became an art teacher there in 1924.  He exhibited his paintings but by the 1930s he concentrated on writing, setting all his stories in Drohobycz.  His vision was an immensely theatrical one in which human beings, objects and spaces take on temporary unstable shapes and forms before metomorphosing into new ones. Bruno Schulz was regarded as one of the three great talents of Polish literature between the wars.  He was killed by the Gestapo in 1942.",
