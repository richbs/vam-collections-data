On the front, in gold, are the dates 1893-1897. There are a number of loose sheets and sections (B.376:2 to 11-2012) which are dispersed throughout the book, though may not be in their original positions.\n\nThroughout, the work is handwritten in pen with a few entries written in pencil. Each exercise book contains the work of more than one subject, and most pages have been marked by the same teacher. The following is a brief overview of each book:\n\n1. Green cover, labelled 'Percy Bishop May 1893'. It contains draft letters to family members, and geography and history facts in numbered lists, probably test answers.\n2. Green cover, labelled 'Percy Bishop November 1893', contains similar material. \n3. Green cover, labelled 'Percy Bishop March 1894'.

Contains dictations about Charles Dickens and Queen Victoria, and some mathematics exercises.\n8. Cover printed 'South College, Kettering, labelled 'Adrian Percy Bishop, History etc. October 1896'. The back of this cover has been inscribed with a number of words written in biro, of a much later date. They include words using the suffixes 'phile' and the prefix 'bio'. Bishop's work starts with the Field of the Cloth of Gold, through to the late Tudors, and also includes Natural History and Grammar. \n9. Light pink cover, printed with 'South College Kettering', labelled 'Dictation etc'. The letters mention what books he is reading, dictations discuss Orangutans, chemistry, Patagonia.\n10. No cover.

Adrian Percy Bishop attended South College, Kettering, from 1892 to 1897.\nThe curriculum is limited to History, Geography, Natural History, Grammar and Scripture - with a smattering of arithmetic. Each subject is taught through long dictation and composition exercises, and ranges across diverse topics day by day. The focus is consistently on the heros of History, the expanse of the Empire (supported by racist and stereotyped representations of 'natives'), and the everyday trade and pastimes of the British.\nThis collection is invaluable for its insights into the way children were encouraged to think and write about the world around them.",
