Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. Above all they had to have the means of attaching the cord. Netsuke were made in a variety of forms. This example takes its basic form from a boar's tusks. This is also the material from which it is made. The large tusks of the wild boar curve almost into a semi-circle and are hollow at the end to accommodate the root. You can see both of these features in this netsuke. The maker has carved and carefully pared down parts of the tusk to create a centipede in relief. \nAlthough this netsuke is unsigned, we know that it was made by one of the netsuke carvers from Iwami province. It was an isolated and poor region. This influenced both the materials and the subject-matter of the netsuke made there. This netsuke is made from the tusks of the wild boar that roamed widely in the province. The humble centipede reflects the poverty of the region.",
