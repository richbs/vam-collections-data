H&M hosted the launch with a high profile party in London at the St Olaves School building,Tower Bridge. The party included a catwalk show where models dressed in the collection played musical chairs. The media coverage was extensive and when the line was launched at selected H&M stores there were queues along the street and the stock sold out almost instantly. Within several hours of release numerous pieces appeared on ebay for sale by customers who had bulk bought . Realising that the demand for pieces would be high the items were for sale at a higher price than they had been in the store. \nThe jumpsuit is a garment which often appears in Stella McCartney's work for her own main line collections, this light silk, loose fit and soft tie belt are all indicative of her relaxed signature style.",
