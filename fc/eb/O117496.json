The printmaker uses the dabber to spread an acid resistant wax-like substance called the 'ground' over the metal plate. The lines of the image are scratched through the ground with an etching needle exposing the metal underneath. The plate is then placed in an acid bath and the corrosive action of the acid 'bites' into the metal where it is unprotected by the ground, creating grooves beneath the surface of the plate that correspond to the lines scratched in the ground. The longer the plate remains in the acid, the deeper the groove that is bitten into the metal and the stronger the printed line. \n\nTo make a print, or impression, from the etched plate, ink is applied and forced into the grooves where it is held while the surface of the plate is wiped clean. Paper is then laid over the plate and together they are submitted to pressure (usually in a roller press) so that the paper draws the ink out of the grooves in the plate. The printed image is in reverse of that on the plate.",
