The seven ascetics and their attendant are all dressed in fantastic attire: one wears a tasselled costume, one carries a tasselled umbrella, one wears a huge turban, and one is accompanied by five monkeys and three dogs. These ascetics were well-known characters in Delhi. The effete figure with tassels hanging from his waist was called Sarhaj, a Brahmin of the Chaube caste from Gokal, Brindaban, known as 'Mr Flowery Man'.\n\n'Company paintings' were produced by Indian artists for Europeans living and working in the Indian subcontinent, especially British employees of the East India Company. They represent a fusion of traditional Indian artistic styles with conventions and technical features borrowed from western art. Some Company paintings were specially commissioned, while others were virtually mass-produced and could be purchased in bazaars.",
