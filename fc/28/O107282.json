McGowan was the same age as the programme's audience and spoke with teenage slang, making her audience empathize with her. \n\nShe was a patron of Biba and her own popularity helped popularize the mini-skirt and shifts. Barbara Hulanicki, founder of Biba observed that \"girls aped Cathy's long hair and eye-covering fringe and soon their little faces were growing heavy with stage make-up\". McGowan also had her own range of fashion at British Home Stores, and a portable make-up kit was named 'Cathy's Survival Kit'.",
