In view of its position in the text it is possible that it depicts a small skirmish that took place between Mughal forces and the army of the minor ruler of Dungarpur, in Rajasthan.\n\nThe Akbarnama was commissioned by the Mughal emperor Akbar (r.1556\u20131605) as the official chronicle of his reign. It was written in Persian by his court historian and biographer, Abu\u2019l Fazl, between 1590 and 1596, and the V&A\u2019s partial copy of the manuscript is thought to have been illustrated between about 1592 and 1595. This is thought to be the earliest illustrated version of the text, and drew upon the expertise of some of the best royal artists of the time. Many of these are listed by Abu\u2019l Fazl in the third volume of the text, the A\u2019in-i Akbari, and some of these names appear in the V&A illustrations, written in red ink beneath the pictures, showing that this was a royal copy made for Akbar himself. After his death, the manuscript remained in the library of his son Jahangir, from whom it was inherited by Shah Jahan.\n\nThe V&A purchased the manuscript in 1896 from Frances Clarke, the widow of Major General John Clarke, who bought it in India while serving as Commissioner of Oudh between 1858 and 1862.",
