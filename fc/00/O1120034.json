They could be more easily made and adjusted than many other baby garments, and also lent themselves well to a number of different techniques and fabrics.  One of the most popular styles for babies and children in the eighteenth century was the plain design based on squares and oblongs, and which survived longest in use in charity schools.  This was thrifty, needing no patterns and wasting almost no fabric.  Nineteenth century makers often liked to experiment with more complex constructions, and decorative effects such as embroidery or lace.",
