Dealers of the 19th and 20th centuries referred to them as \"Savonarola\" chairs, named after Fra Girolamo Savonarola (1452 - 1498), who is unlikely to have ever sat on such a seat!  Large numbers of these chairs were made from about 1880 and found their way into middle-class households in Italy and throughout Europe, in keeping with the Renaissance Revival fashions, almost to the point where they became something of a clich\u00e9. Unfortunately many 'x' frame chairs were acquired by museums at this time under the illusion that they were authentic. \n\nBy the 16th century, chairs were more widespread than in previous centuries and they had  lost much of the hierarchichal connotations that they had in the Middle Ages. It is noteworthy that as late as 1418 even the Medici had only six chairs in their residence in Florence. Although this example follows the 'x' frame pattern, long associated with Roman Emperors and Medieval princes, by about 1550 chairs were no longer entirely the preserve of the master of the house, and larger numbers were appearing in inventories. By 1609, even the hall porter in the household of Amerigo di Luca Pitti had two large cane-seated chairs (<i>seggiolaccie alla pistolese</i>) at his disposal.",
