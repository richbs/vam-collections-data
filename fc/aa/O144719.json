It was donated to the Victoria and Albert Museum by his goddaughter in 1936. Speedy was an army officer and colonial official. In 1860 he travelled to Ethiopia to assist the emperor Tewodros II (Theodore) with military training. Speedy returned in 1868, this time as civilian interpreter to a British military expedition aimed at releasing British subjects held hostage by Tewodros. The expedition ended with the capture of the emperor\u2019s fortress at Magdala, but not before Tewodros had committed suicide. The following death of his wife, Queen Woyzaro Terunesh, left an orphan son, Prince Dejatch Alamayou, to whom the Amharic-speaking Captain became guardian. \n\nIt is unclear how Speedy acquired the anklet. Museum documentation suggests that the main part of the anklet is formed of rhinoceros hide but it may be horn. This part has been tipped at both ends with silver, with further silver decoration on the main body.",
