            "public_access_description": "Stephen was one of the first deacons of the early Christian church, shortly after the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. In the New Testament book of Acts he is described as a popular preacher. However, the Sanhedrin, the supreme Jewish council, misinterpreted his teachings and accused him of blasphemy. This was a charge punishable by death. Stephen was brought before the Sanhedrin to answer these charges and was put to death by stoning.\n\nIn medieval art, moving hands indicate the act of talking. In this panel we see St. Stephen talking or in debate with someone.  This is probably the Jewish high priest, who appears to be in the act of condemning him.\n\nStephen was the first to die for the Christian faith and is known as the 'protomartyr'. His feast day is 26 December, which is usually now referred to as 'Boxing Day' in England.\n\nThere are no documents to tell us where he was martyred, but in the 5th century the Byzantine Empress Eudoxia built a church on the site where oral tradition claimed it occured. This was outside the Damascus Gate in Jerusalem.\n\nStephen's relics were later taken to Constantinople (present-day Istanbul) and then to Rome. There they were interred with the bones of St. Laurence in the church of San Lorenzo fuori le Mura, which is still a pilgrimage site.\n\nIn medieval art, Stephen's Ordination, Preaching and Stoning are the most usual scenes from his life to be depicted. He is often shown with his attribute (identifying symbol) of stones, the instruments of his martyrdom.",

            "historical_context_note": "Stephen was one of the first deacons of the emerging Christian faith shortly after the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. He is reported in the Book of Acts in the New Testament and is described as a popular preacher. However, his teachings were misinterpreted by the Sanhedrin, the supreme Jewish council, and they accused him of blasphemy. This was a charge punishable by death. Stephen was brought before the Sanhedrin to answer these charges and was put to death by stoning.\n\nIn this panel St. Stephen is seen talking or in debate with someone. In Medieval art, the act of talking is depicted by moving hands. This is most likely the Jewish high priest and he appears to be in the act of condemning Stephen.\n\nStephen was the first to die for the Christian faith and is known as the 'protomartyr'. His feast day is December 26, now referred to as 'Boxing Day' in England.\n\nThe site of his martyrdom was not recorded but in the 5th century the Eastern Empress Eudoxia built a church on the site where oral tradition claimed it occured. This was outside the 'Damascus Gate' in Jerusalem.\n\nHis relics were later taken to Constantinople and then to Rome where they are interred with the bones of St. Laurence in the church of San Lorenzo fuori le Mura, still a pilgrimage site.\n\nThe stories related to St. Stephen's life that are usually depicted in Medieval art are those of his Ordination, his Preaching and his Stoning.\n\nHe is often depicted with his attribute of the stones, the instruments of his martyrdom.",
