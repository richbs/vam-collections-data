It has certainly been bound as part of a volume because the edges of the sheet (and of its six companions) have been gilded. The image is somewhat crudely executed, in part due to the thick dull pigment, but the subject is readily identifiable. Though the artist lacked the skill to deal convincingly with representational devices such as foreshortening, the actual structure of the plant suggests that he has studied either a living specimen or a botancially accurate model.",
