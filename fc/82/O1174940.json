Made of nylon, it wasn't made to be worn, but rather to be held up outstretched in the audience so that the band could see your adoration. This fashion came from the British phenomenon of having a scarf in your supported team's colours, and holding it up on the football terraces.\n\nThis scarf features the band Slade, a British Glam rock band from the early 1970s. They had twelve top five singles in the UK between 1971 and 1974, have been cited as an influence by Kiss, and were covered in the 1990s by Oasis. Their 1973 song Merry Xmas Everybody has been re-released every decade since the 1970s, and in a 2007 MSN music poll was voted the UK's favourite Christmas song.",
