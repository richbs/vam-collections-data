These elections were part of the process by which Estonia gained independence from the Soviet Union.\n  \nMoving upward at the centre of the poster are five coats of arms. They show the coat of arms of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic transforming into the coat of arms of the Republic of Estonia.\n\nThe elections of the ESSR Supreme Soviet (which became the Republic of Estonia Supreme Council on 8 May 1990) were held on 18 March 1990. These were mostly democratic elections: all permanent residents of Estonia had the right to vote. However four representatives were elected from the Soviet Army closed electoral districts. The majority of political powers active in Estonia at this time participated in the elections. The exception was a radical wing of independence movement (ERSP), which protested against the presence of occupying Soviet military forces and their involvement in the elections.\n\nThe elections were won by the Estonian Popular Front with 24% of all votes cast (45 seats in the 105-member Supreme Council). The Supreme Council elected Arnold R\u00fc\u00fctel as the Chairman and \u00dclo Nugis as the Speaker. Edgar Savisaar was appointed Chairman of the Council of Ministers. The \u2018transition parliament\u2019 adopted two documents restoring the sovereignty of Estonia. The resolution \u2018On the State Status of Estonia\u2019, adopted on 30 March 1990, proclaimed a period of transition  that was planned to conclude with the restoration of national statehood. The document \u2018On the National Independence of Estonia\u2019, adopted on 20 August 1991, constituted the restoration of the Republic of Estonia de facto.",
