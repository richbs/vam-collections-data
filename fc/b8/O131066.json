'La Boh\u00e9mienne' was woven at least 14 times. Badin notes its production in 1738 (twice), 1739, 1740 (twice), 1741 (twice), 1745, 1750 (3 times), 1759 and 1762. Of these, one of the sets of 1750 was made for the King of Sweden and is still part of the royal collections, and the set of 1762 is in the Metropolitan Museum, New York. There were also sets made which went unrecorded Badin: in the Departmental collection of photographs are two pieces (including 'La Boh\u00e9mienne') with the arms of Rohan-Soubise, probably ordered for the Hotel Soubise by the Duc de Rohan-Rohan (d. 1749).",
