It became particularly popular in mourning jewellery in the mid 19th century, encouraged by Queen Victoria\u2019s prolonged mourning after the death of her husband Albert in 1861. \n\nExpensive work in black-enamelled gold was made by hand.  Jet was much in demand, and the workshops in Whitby, Yorkshire, near the main source of the material, produced articles which often comprised hand-carved details applied to mass-produced bodies turned on lathes.  \n\nMass production methods, and the use of substitute materials, brought mourning jewellery within reach of all but the poorest.  This piece is made of 'French jet', executed in cast glass mounted on gilded copper. The glass has been cast with facets, to resemble cut gemstones. A panel on the back holds plaited hair, most likely the hair of a deceased friend or family member.",

Expensive work in black-enamelled gold was made by hand.  Jet was much in demand, and the workshops in Whitby, Yorkshire, near the main source of the material, produced articles which often comprised hand-carved details applied to mass-produced bodies turned on lathes.  Mass production methods, and the use of substitute materials, brought mourning jewellery within reach of all but the poorest.  This piece is made of 'French jet', executed in cast glass mounted on metal.",
