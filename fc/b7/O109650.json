In 1126 the Hebei province experienced great change as the Northern Song dynasty ended and the Jin dynasty established power. Despite such upheaval, Ding wares continued to be produced as an 'official ware\u2019, meaning it was selected for use at court and by the most elite officials in China. \n\nFrom the beginning of the Jin dynasty, the characteristics of Ding wares changed slightly. Instead of the hand-incised decorations which previously adorned its surfaces, its designs and forms began to mimic that of the metal ware of the period through the use of moulded design. This was achieved by pressing the clay over convex moulds, which gave the form of the object and impressed the inside pattern onto the body in one step. The elaborately detailed lobes bordering this dish would have been time-consuming and difficult to achieve without the precision afforded by this technique.",
