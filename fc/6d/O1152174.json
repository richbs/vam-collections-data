The bill includes the wire walking act The Hanneford Trio, the juggler Frank Boston, the South American dance duo The Two Hurricanes, Alda &amp; Dorette, and 'Skeets' Martin. It also featured the double act Arthur Astill and Gwen Fontaine, billed as 'Mirth, Mimicry and Ventriloquism', in an act entitled 'Impressions of Country Life' which included the mimicry of birds, animals and children. \n\nThis hanging card was part of a collection made by Arthur Astill (1887-1962) of advertisements from theatres where he and his wife Gwen Fontaine appeared. It is typical of the format of two-colour printing used in the 1940s to advertise Variety, with the names of the most popular stars literally appearing at the 'top of the bill'. The names of Astill and Fontaine are at the bottom of this bill.",
