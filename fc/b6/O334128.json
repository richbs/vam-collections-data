It would have probably been intended for use in interior decoration. Similarly framed figure groups were also made by the Frankenthal factory.\n\nThe porcelain factory at Fulda in Hesse in northern Germany was founded in 1764 by the Prince Bishop Heinrich VIII von Bibra. Like several other northern European porcelain factories, it was set up in the premises of an earlier tin-glazed earthenware works. It was established using the 'arcana' (secret knowledge of porcelain recipes, firing and other processes) by the travelling 'arcanist' Nicholas Paul, who had previously worked at H\u00f6chst, Berlin, F\u00fcrstenburg, Weesp, and who subsequently moved on to Kassel. The factory was closed following the death of the Bishop in 1789.",
