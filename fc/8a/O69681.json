Her left hand is under a blanket covering her to about waist level; the folds of the bed-covering have been treated in a very decorative manner. With her right hand she grasps a palm held by the figure of St. John the Evangelist, who kneels at the front of the panel. The apostles, four of whom kneel in the front of the panel, are bearded, with the exception of St. John. Seven figures of apostles are in the damaged upper part of the panel. \n\nThe head of an apostle is missing in the top left corner of the panel and so probably is the figure of an apostle in the top right, which would have brought the number of the apostles depicted to twelve. The right hand of the apostle leaning over the Virgin above the palm branch is damaged. The top left of the panel is chipped and the top right is missing.\n\nTraces of green paint and the usual daisy pattern remain on the ground at the bottom of the panel. Slight traces of reddish paint are on the apostles' faces, dark brown on their eyes, hair and beards. Red and gilt remain on their robes and brown on the Virgin's garment. Dark brown paint remains on the palm. Slight traces of red are on the Virgin's face, brown on her eyes and gilding on her veil. The upper background of the panel is gilt. \n\nThe back of the panel is marked with six more or less parallel lines (two of the lines run together). There are three lead-plugged holes. The bottom has been cut away.",

With her right hand she grasps a palm held by the figure of St John the Evangelist, who kneels at the front of the panel, flanked by the apostles. According to legend the apostles were miraculously brought to the Virgin's deathbed, and four are shown kneeling in front with the remaining seven behind in the damaged upper part of the panel.  The palm passed from the Virgin to St John had been gathered in Paradise three days before her death by an angel who instructed that it should be carried before her bier. This story became well known in the thirteenth century.",

There are two other recorded examples, one at Breuil-Benoit, Eure, and one at St. Mary's College of Education, Strawberry Hill, Twickenham. The subject was common in paintings and prints. There is, however, a panel in the presbytery of the Roman Catholic church in Emmerich, Germany, which shows a female figure evidently dying in bed with an attendant male figure standing at the side beneath a representation of the Trinity; this unique panel probably represents a scene from the <font -u>Ars Moriendi</font -u>.",
