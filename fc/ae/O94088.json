This medal has only the obverse which represents bust of an unknown cardinal, facing left, clean-shaven and wearing a coif and hood. \n\nIt was argued that this medal is likely to date from after 1526 because the subject is shown with his head in profile, and his shoulders half turned towards the front, a pose believed to date from after 1526. However, earlier medals probably produced by Hagenauer in the anonymous Nuremberg workshop of 1525/7 show the same pose. The date of this medal, therefore, is uncertain. \n\nHagenauer was primarily a medalist, but is also known to have executed sculpture. He travelled widely in Germany, although he was chiefly active in Augsburg.",
