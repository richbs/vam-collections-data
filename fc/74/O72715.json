Natalia Goncharova designed it for the Maison Myrbor (House of Myrbor) in Paris about 1923. The dress is sleeveless and has a square, straight shape with a wide, round neckline. The shoulders are slightly rushed and there are slits on both sides of the dress from the hip level down. The appliqu\u00e9s are embroidered with metallic thread. The neck and armholes are bound with lam\u00e9.\n\nNatalia Goncharova (1881-1962) had a long career with Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. She produced astonishing costumes that were inspired by her Russian background and her work with avant-garde artists. Like many Russian refugees in Paris, she also designed dresses. These strongly reflected her work for Diaghilev. Between 1922 and 1926 she worked for the Maison Myrbor. This exclusive shop was owned by the Italian Marie Cuttoli. It sold fashion, rugs and curtains designed by the international avant-garde.",

She was considered to be one of the great international beauties, with extremely pale, almost transparent skin and golden hair. She was frequently the subject of articles in the New York Times during the early 20th century. Her clothes were purchased from couturiers in London, Paris, and New York, and demonstrated an elegantly avant-garde approach to style.\n\nAt the time of acquisition, Miss Grigsby's friend, Miss Chisholm said that the patchwork on similar Myrbor items was the work of Madame Coutoli, who had workshops in Algeria.",
