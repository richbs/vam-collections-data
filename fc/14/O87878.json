This card and original artwork have been chosen for inclusion in the Print Room 'education boxes.'  These boxes contain objects linked by a particular topic and are aimed at school groups.  They are advertised on the V&A website and include labels explaining how they relate to the topic in question.\n\nThe topic here was the design process, or how designers get from first idea to finished project.  On the right is the original artwork, incorporating layers of paint, ballpoint pen and pen and ink.  Although the effect is very painterly, there are certain clues which show that this is really a design for the mass produced card on the left.  First, the image follows a formula. It has all the elements traditionally associated with new babies and the background is a soft lilac colour, a blend of the usual pale pinks and blues. These conventions are there to help the customer to distinguish it from other kinds of card in the shop.  Second, there are some physical signs that the image has been transferred to print. For example, the centre marks on the mount, traces of adhesive tape, pinholes and stock codes on the reverse."

The greeting inside reads \u2018Love to Baby\u2019. The card shows a baby wearing a christening gown, together with his or her proud parents, a crib, a teddy bear and a fluffy bunny - all traditional elements of cards for new babies. The background is a soft lilac colour, a blend of the pale pinks and blues associated with newborn babies. These conventions ensure that the card conforms to common notions of infancy and help the customer to distinguish it from other kinds of cards in the shop. The Victoria and Albert Museum holds the original artwork for this card.",
