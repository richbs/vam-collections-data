Worked as a housepainter, then a portraitist, but made his name with small genre paintings in the manner of Sir David Wilkie. Moved to London 1822. Exhibited 19 works at the RA between 1820 and 1833, 43 at the BI 1823-34, two at the SBA in 1824 and 1831, and 17 at the RSA 1815-50 (elected Honorary Member in 1828). Married Mary Evans 1839. For some reason, it is said an inheritance, he gave up painting after 1834. Died Berwick 15 April 1872. \n\nLIT: <i>Portfolio</i> 1889, pp111-3 \n\n<b>Scotch Fishermen</b> \n1827-1900 Neg 51760 \nPanel, 27.9 x 37.1 cm (11 x 14 5/8 ins) \nAshbee Bequest 1900 \n\nGood exhibited several coastal scenes with fishermen, presumably set in and around Berwick, on the coast in the south-east Borders of Scotland. Berwick is famous for its fishing, particularly salmon fishing on the River Tweed; this painting is set on a rocky coastal shore.\"",
