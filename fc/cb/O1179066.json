Pageot trained as a jewellery designer. In 1908, he won a competition to work in London.  His designs for the royal cipher for King George V can still be seen on some British post boxes, for example, at Bembridge Post Office, Isle of Wight.  In addition, he designed the badge for the Royal Flying Corps that became the Royal Air Force.  \n\nPageot was a freelance jewellery designer apparently working for jewellers such as Cartier in London.  His work is important to jewellery history because the brief period when he worked can be pinpointed to 1908 and his untimely death in 1917.  His high quality and prolific output of designs thus provide a valuable record of design from 1908 to 1917.",
