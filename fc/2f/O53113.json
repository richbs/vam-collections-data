The structure at the top has later been reinforced with battens screwed in place.\n\nThe three front legs are each made in a sandwich or laminate of two thin, full-height pieces, laterally joined. The two pierced front aprons are recessed into the back face of the front part of the sandwich, and this was apparently done before the back part of the sandwich was glued in place. Consequently the jointing above the apron is looser than it is below. The side aprons are housed in mortises in the front and back legs. The three front legs are rebated on their front face, at the top, to support the front rail, and (at the right leg at least) they are nailed from the back to the rail. The four outer legs, front and back, are rebated on their outer face to support the side rails, which butt up to the front rail. The outer back legs (but not the front legs) are nailed to the side rails. The back rail, which sits below the front and side rails, is rebated into the back face of the three back legs (which are not laminated) and nailed in place from the back. \n\nThe two pairs of cross-stretchers are each formed from two rails of scrolled profile, half-lapped to each other in the centre, where they are surmounted by a later(?) circular platform, held in place by a single screw from the underside. The ends of the stretchers are all nailed to the inner faces of the legs, at the rectangular blocks above the feet.\n\nThe top framing has been reinforced later by four battens: two screwed to the inside face of the side rails; one cross-batten screwed (with two countersunk screws) to the back of the middle front leg, and rebated at the back to rest on top of the middle back leg. A full-length thin batten is rebated and screwed to the back of the outer back legs, and screwed to the back edge of the new central cross-batten. Originally there was apparently no rail or batten in this position, the only original back rail being the lower one described above.",

They were highly decorated and contained many drawers for valuable and unusual objects. They were also objects of display in their own right. This cabinet has been 'japanned'. Japanning was a decoration that imitated lacquer made in East Asia. Professional craftsmen carried it out, and it also became a popular pastime for wealthy women. The taste for silvered, wooden furniture in England derived from furniture actually made in silver for the French court of Louis XIV (ruled 1643-1715). Very little of this survives, because Louis had it melted down to pay for his military campaigns. It is rare for such ornate crestings to remain complete. This cabinet belonged to Sir Richard Hill (1655-1727), who became Deputy Paymaster to William III's forces in Flanders.",

            "history_note": "This 17th-century japanned cabinet was originally in the collection of Lord Hill at Hardwick Grange, Hawkstone, Shropshire. It appears to have been sold as part of a large auction of the contents of Hardwick Grange in 1930, when it was bought by one of the companies owned by the American publisher William Randolph Hearst (1863-1951). Sold by Mr Hearst to the Countess Dusautoy in 1938, the cabinet was bought by the V&A in 1959. \n\nAssuming that the cabinet came into the Hill family in the late 17th-century, it would most likely have been bought by Richard Hill (1655-1727). Richard Hill was a diplomat and public servant who worked as an envoy to Brussels and Turin in the late 17th-century, most notably negotiating with the Dutch to bring the duke of Savoy into the War of Spanish Succession against Louis XIV. Richard Hill was extremely wealthy, leaving bequests in his will of \u00a363.618 16s. He devoted much of his later life to consolidating the family's three large Shropshire estates, including rebuilding the house at Hawkstone to his own design. [1]\n\n<u>Notes</u>\n\n1. Randolph Vigne, 'Hill, Richard', entry from the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/13289. Accessed 5 July 2011.\n\nHistorical significance: This japanned cabinet is an excellent example of the 17th-century form. The carcase and mounts of the cabinet mirror the forms of contemporary pieces imported from China and Japan, while the heavily-carved and silvered baroque forms of its stand and cresting are typical of those made in England from around the 1660s. It is very rare for cabinets such as this to survive with their original silvered stands, making this piece of particular importance.\n\nThe cabinet is also a fascinating example of contemporary japanning technique.  Its subjects are typical examples of the period, with the motifs of exotic plants, flowers and birds similar to those seen in Stalker and Parker. The genre scenes on the cabinet's drawers and doors provide a well-executed variation on the imagined Oriental life pictured by Stalker and Parker and in other lacquered and japanned objects of the period. The surfaces of the cabinet are also japanned with a background of imitated tortoiseshell, a technique that adds to the perceived luxury and exoticism of the piece, and is described in detail in Stalker and Parker's book.\n\nIn its surface decoration, carving and form, this cabinet provides an excellent surviving example of a network of local manufacture and imitative technique that developed out of the huge expansions in trade and commerce in 17th-century England.",

            "historical_context_note": "The word \u2018cabinet\u2019 originally referred to a small, semi-portable pieces of furniture containing a number of small drawers and usually decorated with precious materials such as ebony and ivory. These personal objects were common in English noble houses of the 16th and early 17th century, where they would generally sit on top of tables or chests. \n\nThese small, moveable cabinets were gradually replaced during the first half of the 17th-century with lavish large-scale cabinets on stands, such as this example. Forming the focus of a house\u2019s public rooms, cabinets on stands were essential furnishing for a fashionable apartment by the 1660s, becoming important signs for the wealth and status of the household.\n\nHighly-ornate cabinets were imported into English collections from European workshops throughout the 17th century. They also became the specialist trade of a number of English craftsmen, with the term cabinet-maker adopted in increasing numbers by joiners working from the 1660s onwards.  \n\nThe market for this kind of cabinet was boosted by a rise in the English economy during the latter half of the 17th century. During a post-Restoration period of urbanisation and rapidly-growing trade with Asia, a booming economy enabled larger numbers of people from the \u2018middling\u2019 rank of society to buy luxury commodities. In this growing market for luxury furniture, cabinets moved from being an emblem of wealth and status reserved purely for the super-rich into a common feature of many houses of the gentry and wealthy middling sorts.\n\nIn the history of the 17th-century cabinet, the lacquer cabinet is of particular significance. Lacquer cabinets made in China and Japan were imported into 17th-century England by the Dutch East India Company. From the earliest imports of the late 16th-century, a huge demand for Asian lacquered objects grew throughout England and across Europe. This demand, fuelled by the newness and perceived exoticism of the technique, saw lacquered cabinets become among the most prized furnishings of the fashionable English Restoration interior. \n\nEuropean and English imitation techniques quickly developed in an attempt to locally  fill the market for lacquered furniture. Known in England as \u2018japanning\u2019, European imitation lacquer used varnishes and paint to achieve a similar finish to that found in Asian work. Craftsmen who specialised in japanning grew very quickly in numbers, and guides to the technique, such as Stalker and Parker\u2019s <i>A Treatise of Japanning and Varnishing</i>, were published. [1]  \n\nOver the course of the 17th century, japanned furniture was increasingly implicated in local debate over the value of luxury imported goods to English economy and society. By the early 18th-century, craftsmen practising japanning had started a lobby to try to limit the import of lacquer into England in favour of locally-produced work.  Japanning was also increasingly recommended to women as a suitable leisured pursuit, thus folding it into highly-politicised 18th-century associations between women, luxury and the Orient.\n\n<u>Notes</u>\n\n1.
