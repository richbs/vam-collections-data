            "bibliography": "Parkinson, R., Victoria and Albert Museum, <u>Catalogue of British Oil Paintings 1820-1860</u>, London: HMSO, 1990, p. 87\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\"ETTY, William, RA (1787-1849)\n\nBorn York 10 March 1787, the son of a baker. Apprenticed to a printer at Hull, moved to London 1805, entered the RA Schools 1807 and studied with Sir Thomas Lawrence. Early works were mainly portraits and nude studies; his first large figure composition was 'The Coral Finder' (1820). Exhibited 138 works at the RA between 1811 and 1850, and 77 at the BI 1811-47. Travelled abroad in 1815/6, 1822, and 1830, principally to Paris and Italy. Elected ARA 1824, RA 1828. A retrospective exhibition was held at the Society of Arts 1849. Died York 13 November 1849. His studio sale was at Christie's 6-10 and 13-14 May 1850. Most admired in his lifetime for his large mythological subjects, but now perhaps more appreciated for his less finished and smaller studies of the nude. \n\nLIT: A Gilchrist <i>Life of William Etty</i> 2 vols, 1855; W Gaunt and F G Roe <i>Etty and the Nude</i> Leigh-on-sea 1943; D Farr <i>William Etty</i> 1958 \n\n<b>Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm (after W ETTY)</b> \n249-1866 \nCanvas, 61 x 44.1 cm (24 x 17 3/8 ins) \nPurchased 1866 \n\nA reduced copy by Alfred Morgan of William Etty's painting exhibited at the RA in 1832, which was bought by Robert Vernon and given by him to the NG in 1847 (now Tate Gallery; 158.7 x 117.5 cm/62\u00bd x 46\u00bc ins; Farr no 109). Etty's original was engraved by C W Sharpe for both <i>The Vernon Gallery</i> and the <i>Art Journal</i> (p 128) in 1850. Etty explained the subject (quoted in <i>The Vernon Gallery</i> 1850): 'The view I took of it as a general allegory of Human Life, morally, where what we see here portrayed in its fabulous sense, is often real'. The title is a quotation from Thomas Gray's poem <i>The Bard</i> (first published 1757), part 2 verse 2: \n\nThy son is gone. He rests among the dead. \nThe swarm that in thy noon-tide beam were born? \nGone to salute the rising morn. \nFair laughs the morn and soft the zephyr blows, \nWhile proudly riding o'er the azure realm \nIn gallant trim the gilded vessel goes; \nYouth on the prow and Pleasure at the helm; \nRegardless of the sweeping whirlwind's sway, \nThat, hushed in grim repose, expects his evening-prey. \n\nAlfred Morgan (exhibited 1862-1917, died after 1925) exhibited various kinds of subject, 44 at the RA between 1864 and 1917, 7 at the BI 1862-67, and 35 at the SBA 1865-86, also at the Grosvenor Gallery and elsewhere. He was still listed in <i>The Year's Art</i> directory in 1925. His son, Alfred Kedington Morgan, and daughter, Edirh M Morgan, were also artists. \n\nA label on the back of the copy indicates that the work was circulating outside London in the 1890s: Weymouth and Margate (1890), Blackburn and Dorchester (1891), and Hastings (1892). Another copy after Etty was sold at Christie's 13 February 1869 (147). \n\nPROV: The artist and teacher at the South Kensington Schools Richard Burchett; purchased from him by the museum 1866, presumably for teaching purposes\"",
