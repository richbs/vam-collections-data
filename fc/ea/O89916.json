There are four pink flowers which have five petals at the top of the stem.  A further flower sprouts out of a green hairy calyx halfway down the stem next to two other empty ones.  The toothed leaves grow out of the stem on alternate sides.  The modelling is achieved by darker tones of hatching: pink and purple on white for the flowers and dark green and black with splashes of yellow highlights on the leaves.  The painting is framed with irregular strips of beige-coloured paper collaged onto the plain ivory-coloured main border and these have ruled lines in black at their edges with two further roughly ruled lines at the outer edge.  The page has strips of blue-grey paper collaged along its margins with two more ruled lines in black.  The inner right hand edge of the page has a strip of grey paper added over the abraded paper margin to act as a gutter for the present album binding.",

It contains 56 leaves on which are Mughal miniature paintings, drawing and flower studies on both sides. The binding is covered with an Indian brocade silk that may have been cut from lengths brought home by the 2nd Lord Clive, who served as Governor of Madras, 1799 to 1803.  The album was sold from Powis Castle at Sotheby's sale, 16 to 18 January 1956, lot 332A.",
