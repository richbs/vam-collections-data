To produce a collodion positive, a sheet of glass is hand-coated with a thin film of collodion (guncotton dissolved in ether) containing potassium iodide, and sensitised to the light with silver nitrate to create a collodion negative. The back is then painted black or covered with a piece of dark cardboard or cloth in order to achieve the effect of a positive image.\n\nThis collodion positive from the 1850s shows a seated woman, looking to her  left. It is cased and gilt framed in a highly decorative frame with arch window, and the print is hand tinted.\n\nHand tinting was the first technique used to produce photographs, or parts of photographs, in colour. Hand tinting was first used in the early 1840s, and was achieved by washing prints in gold chloride solution at the final stage in the chemical process. Colour pigments were then applied in the form of liquid paint or an adhesive powder using precise brushwork.",
