            "public_access_description": "The signature 'VLOCRINO' appears on several plaquettes which bear a strong relationship to the work of Andrea Briosco, called il Riccio, and can be assigned to Padua in the late fifteenth or early sixteenth century. The pseudonym can be translated as 'curly head', the same as 'Riccio', and it has been proposed that these plaquettes were produced by Riccio himself.\nThe present plaquette is extremely rare, being known only in four other examples: one formerly in Berlin (destroyed 1945), another in the National Museum of Art (Kress Collection), Washington and two in the British Museum. \n\nWe know little about the artist, Ulocrino. What we do know for certain is there is a coherent body of work with this signature, from between 1485 and 1530, of a style and subject matter that suggests Padua or Venice. The compatability of this body of plaquettes by Ulocrino with works by the renowned Paduan sculptor Andrea Briosco, called 'Riccio', has led to the suggestion that they might be by the hand of Riccio, signing under a pseudonym. 'Riccio' means 'curly-head' in Italian, and it has been mooted that Ulocrino could be a hybrid of the Greek Oulos and Latin crinis that would also mean 'curly-haired'. \n\nThis theory that Ulocrino can be associated with Riccio has been rejected by many because of differences in style with a body of signed Riccio plaquettes, and the fact that such word-games were very popular in the Reniassance which would account for the similar nickname if Ulocrino also had curly hair. But a similarity with Riccio\u2019s later sculpture, and some doubt on the identity of some plaquettes traditionally ascribed to Riccio in recent years, has confused matters further. In summary, it is possible that Ulocrino is Riccio's signature in the later stages of his career.",

(via Christie's, 26 April, lot 81), for \u00a3715 (with departmental fund), in 1976.\nThe signature 'VLOCRINO' appears on several plaquettes which bear a strong relationship to the work of Andrea Briosco, called il Riccio, and can be assigned to Padua in the late fifteenth or early sixteenth century. The pseudonym can be translated as 'curly head', the same as 'Riccio', and it has been proposed that these plaquettes were produced by Riccio himself.\n\nHistorical significance: The present plaquette is extremely rare, being known only in four other examples: one formerly in Berlin (destroyed 1945), another in the National Museum of Art (Kress Collection), Washington and two in the British Museum. This version is of slightly smaller dimensions than the Kress and one of the BM versions, but is of high quality and provides a notable example of the work of this important plaquette artist, who was previously poorly represented in the collection.",
