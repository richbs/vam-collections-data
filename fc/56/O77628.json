A typical dinner service might have four sauce tureens, although as many as ten might be required for the largest and grandest dinners.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe ornate Rococo style of this tureen, with exuberant naturalistic acorn, oak leaf and shell decoration, and scrolled feet, was advanced taste at the time. Its design proved popular and was made, in some quantity, with minor variations from 1810.\n\nPeople\nThe design of this tureen is attributed to Edward Hodges Baily  (1788-1867) on the evidence of  a drawing in the V&A. Baily was a skilled modeller who trained under the sculptor John Flaxman (1755-1826) and worked for the Royal Goldsmiths, Rundell, Bridge & Rundell, from 1815 to1833.  He was appointed chief modeller at Rundell's after Flaxman's death in 1826.\n\nTrading\nThis tureen was probably sold by Rundell, Bridge & Rundell, the firm which dominated the London silversmithing trade in the period 1800-1830. Paul Storr (1771-1844), whose mark appears on the tureen, was a partner in the business and managed the workshop from 1808 to 1819.",
