In the middle of the pediment there is a pedestal for a bust or ornament. In the centre of the cabinet there is a glazed door, originally filled with mirror glass, which has a rounded top. The spandrels are filled with carved foliage. The two side sections which are slightly set back are fitted as cupboards, the doors with fielded panels of figured mahogany. The cornice above each section is decorated with an applied swag of fruit and flowers. Each of these sections of cornice and frieze forms a drawer. The lower stage is constructed of three cupboards; the central cupboard has a truss on each side and the panel enclosed thereby has an applied border of carved scrolls with a shell motif at each corner. In there centre there is a keyhole, with a carved wood cartouche.\n\nThe side panels have applied oval wreaths of ribbon and flower design with leaf ornaments at top and bottom. The frieze, carved with a Greek key pattern, contains three drawers, and was originally fitted in centre with a reading slide. There are lifting handles in the side panels.",
