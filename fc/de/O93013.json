The gory battle scene depicts one of the ferocious battles of the wars of the Nambokucho period. The hero Kusunoki Masatsura is seen fighting against the army of Ashikaga Takauji in 1348. Before the battle Masatsura famously wrote a poem using an arrowhead, on the doors of the Nyorin-ji temple in Kyoto; the poem can still be seen today.\n\nThe battle of Shijo Nawate took place during the period when Japan had two claimants to the imperial throne and the country was plunged into civil war. Kusonoki Matsatsura was the son of Kusonoki Masashige. For his support for the southern imperial court and bravery in battle and the manner of his death (ritual suicide) Masashige was depicted in popular mythology and featured in school textbooks before World War II as the supreme paragon of imperial loyalty.",
