For most of the seventeenth century and even into the early eighteenth century, the Dutch East India Company continued to monopolise trade in China. During this period around five hundred to seven hundred pieces were commissioned bearing a coat of arms. This sweetmeat dish is the first enamelled armorial dish made for a Dutch customer.   \n\nThis piece bears the coat of arms of Johannes Camphuijs (1634-1695) he was employed by the VOC as a junior clerk in Batavia in 1684. Between 1684 and 1691 he acted as Governor General of Batavia after swiftly rising through the ranks. This sweetmeat dish displays a raised arm holding a hammer that reflects his previous profession as a silversmith before joining the VOC.",
