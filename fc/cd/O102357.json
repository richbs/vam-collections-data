His dearly-loved first wife had died in 1763. This second marriage was for political reasons and was not happy.  \nRoyal marriages have always been occasions for elaborate and expensive celebrations and, from the 16th to 18th centuries, they often included a court ballet, in which the aristocracy, including Emperors and Kings, often performed. These entertainments were basically propaganda, showing the monarchs at the centre of the universe or as gods bestowing benefits on their courts and people.  Performed on the occasion of marriages or signing of peace or trade treaties, the message was often 'look how much money we've got, aren't you lucky to be linking yourselves to us', even if the royal coffers were really empty.  \nIn this print, the Archduke Maximilian plays Eros, the god of love, blessing the sadly not-to-be-happy couple.",

These entertainments were essentially propaganda, showing the monarchs at the centre of the universe or as gods bestowing benefits on their courts and people.  Performed on the occasion of marriages or signing of peace or trade treaties, the purpose was to show the power and wealth of the ruler, even if the royal coffers were really empty.",
