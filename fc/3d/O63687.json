When she was staying with my grandmother at Holland House Kinsgate, they used to work at the same table in the window, or in the garden.  When Taglioni left, she found that she had taken my grandmother's scissors by mistake.  My grandmother said - \"By all means keep my scissors & I will keep yours as a keepsake.\"  According to another note, these scissors were always used by Taglioni in her handbag and were sent to Margaret after her death by Taglioni's grand daughter Marguerite de Beauregard.  \nThe scissors are part of a unique collection of memorabilia and personal effects which evoke Marie Taglioni in the last decades of her life.  She was a keen needlewoman and  the collection contains examples of her own work and her personal sewing accessories.  A collection of Taglioni memorabilia was amassed by Margaret Rolfe, the granddaughter of Taglioni's closest friend in London, Mrs Boggs Rolfe; she attended Taglioni's dancing classes and received many gifts of Taglioni memorabilia, from Taglioni herself, from her grandmother and, after Taglioni's death, from her niece, Marguerite Troubetzkoi.  She kept these, with a series of related notes, in various boxes and annotated envelopes (filed separately).  These she passed to Cyril Beaumont, probably for the London Archives of the Dance (a number of the objects were referred to in \"The London Archives of the Dance and some of its Treasures\" by Cyril Beaumont, Ballet Annual, first issue, Adam & Charles Black, London, 1947, p110); the Archives never achieved an independent home and part of the collection, including the Taglioni memorabilia, was stored with Cyril Beaumont, where it became inextricably mixed with his own collection and came to the Museum as part of the Cyril Beaumont Bequest.",
