They would probably have been displayed on a domestic chimneypiece, possibly in front of a mirror. Small vases on pedestals were also set out on dining tables during the dessert course of grand dinners, although such vases were usually unglazed. Pairs and sets of Derby porcelain figures were also sold with pedestals of this general type.\n\nPeople\nThe Neo-classical sculptor John Bacon (1740-1799) may have designed these pedestals and the vases made to go on them. He was paid the remarkably large sum of \u00a3104 for models by William Duesbury (1725-1786), the owner of the Derby factory, between 1769 and 1771.\n\nTrading\nThe Derby factory aimed at the top end of the market and sold much of its output from factory showrooms in Covent Garden, London. The factory also held auctions in London and had agents elsewhere, notably Bath. One London auction of 1773 included a pair of vases and pedestals similar to these. They were described as 'a pair of curious antique urns and pedestals' with goat's-head handles and gilding, and realized nearly \u00a310.  At that time, Chelsea and Derby modellers earned around \u00a32 11s. per week.",
