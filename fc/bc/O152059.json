Beyond the inner frame, the long sides show the edges of scrolled cartouches and the corners are decorated with tightly rolled scrolls of formal foliage. This panel is stamped only, with no foil or polychrome decoration.  There is one horizontal join in the leather, about 16 cm from the top, visible clearly on the back, where the leather has been skived and joined before moulding. The panel extends to form an uneven border beyond the moulded area. Tack holes on these edges show where the leather was stretched out during processes of manufacture. There are three small paper patches on the back, at the topedge.",

At that time the Museum's prime mission was still the education of craftsmen.  The three panels show different stages in the work, from this first stamped design, with no colour, to the finished state, with the stamped decoration covered partly in metal foil which is varnished to give the effect of gold leaf, and partly with colourful paints and varnishes. \n\n'Gilt leather' as it is generally called, was enjoying a strong revival in the 1850s.  This design, like many used for gilt leather, is based on the kind of designs popular in France during the reign of Louis XIV (1643-1715). The firm of Jean Michel Dulud in Paris, who made these panels, was celebrated for this technique and showed at a number of the International Exhibitions, including the Great Exhibition in London in 1851. They were best known for making panels in Gothic or Renaissance styles, but clearly they could also produce good imitations of 17th and 18th century styles.",
