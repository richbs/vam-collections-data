The purple 'zami' (field) is entirely filled with repeated parallel wavy patterns - a row of rosettes within wavy borders of alternate white and yellow, then a row of feather-shaped forms also within similar wavy borders. Both 'pars' (outer borders) and the 'anchala' (end) have double rows of 'buttis' of red rosettes with white tendrils 'nakshas' (patterns). The inner borders on the 'anchala' (end) have motifs depicting a paddle-steamer in two tiers with three crew members and three European couples on board. The three crew members are engaged in the navigation of the steamer - one is standing on a platform and looking out through a telescope, another is either measuring the depth of water or checking the speed using a line and the third is probably steering. A side paddle as well as the chimney of the steamer are visible. This motif is repeated to form horizontal and vertical border processions, defined by another border system of repeating rosettes. A large 'kalka' (paisley pattern) with white edge in the centre of this section ('anchala') is decorated with a set of rosettes in red with yellow and another in red with blue. This type of silk brocade is known as Baluchar Buttidar Sari.",
