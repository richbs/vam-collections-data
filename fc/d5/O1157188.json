            "public_access_description": "Outer cover of the sheet music for Now what will become of poor old Ireland? or Charlie Parlie it was published in circa 1880 by Francis, Day &Hunter, London.\nThe song was sung by Charles Bignell and also J.W.Rowley, Charles Chaplin, Arthur Ring and the Author-Composer.\n\nThe front sheet features a series of colour illustrations. The background illustration is of a night time scene, the moon covered with clouds. In the moonlight a ladder is visible and a man struggles to climb it. In the centre is a framed illustration of a man in a dark evening suit. He is wearing glasses and holds a printed song sheet between his hands. To the left of this central illustration is a small caricature of the song's writer and composer, Arthur West.\n\nThe back sheet is printed with a list of Francis & Day's 'Newest Comic Songs', its inner cover is printed with the lyrics for the song.\n\nThe inspiration for this song which criticises Ireland's desire for Home Rule, appears to be a response to the campaigns of the Irish Political Leader, Charles Parnell. Charles Parnell (1846-1891) led the Irish Parliamentary Party as Member of Parliament (MP) through the period of Parliamentary nationalism in Ireland between 1875 and his death in 1891. Scandalous rumours about his long term affair with a married woman damaged his efforts to negotiate Home Rule for Ireland.",
