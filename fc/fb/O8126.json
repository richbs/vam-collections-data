The family is in the bottom centre, in a cave below a stone and wood arch.  The infant is in the centre, with the mother and father behind and a cow and donkey at the back.  In front to the sides is a fruit tree, with red spots, on the left and a man on the right.  Above the cave is a representation of a middle eastern town, with sheep, shepherds, other men and women, palm trees, fruit trees and bushes.  The scene is probably made of papier mache but may be moulded plastic, with moulded plastic figures and buildings.  These are flat backed and painted in fairly dark colours.  The scenery is black with traces of white and overlaid with very fine wood stained in greens, browns and yellows to give a grass effect.\nThe scene is glued into an oval box painted dark blue both inside and out.  The top part represents the sky and is plain except for a number of small gold stars placed at the back.\n[Nativity scene] The outside of the box is painted dark blue and decorated with swaths and heart designs painted in yellow.  The underside is plain wood.\n[Box lid] Painted dark blue to match the base.  The top is decorated with a floral pattern in the centre and small flowers around the edge with a band of swaths.  Some of the painting is raised.  The colours used are white, red and yellow.",
