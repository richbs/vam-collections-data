Beneath this legend in ten different types of lettering is the date 1831, a scale for British Statute Miles and a note on the distances in figures marked on the roads between towns and on sea routes, and the latter is indicated on the map by dotted lines.\n\nThe map is printed in black from a very finely engraved plate. It shows Scotland as far north as Edinburgh, only the east coast of Ireland,  and France as far south as Brest and Chartres and as far east as Lille.\n\nAt the foot of the map, in the border containing the numbers of the grid lines of latitude and longitude, is inscribed with 'ENGRAVED AND PUBLISHED BY CRUCHLEY, MAP SELLER, from Arrowsmith's 38 Ludgate Street, London'.",
