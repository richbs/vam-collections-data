The slips could then be worked through, such as by dragging a comb, to create marbled patterning. In appearance marbled wares are similar to earlier agate-ware. Agate-ware involved wedging different coloured clays together to form the body. The patterning was therefore solid throughout rather than being a marbled covering. Agate-ware was more time-consuming and expensive to perfect than surface marbling and was mainly produced during the early to mid eighteenth century, whereas marbling continued into the nineteenth century.",
