The jewellery worn in towns, which is often Ottoman or western in style, is frequently very different from that worn by the nomadic Bedouin, whose characteristic silver jewellery is much better known today.  \n\nThe small size of this earring and the fact that it is gilded suggest that it was made for urban wear.  The crescent shape is typical of those worn throughout the Islamic world.",
