At that time the Museum bought many modern pieces that demonstrated fine craftsmanship, to serve as inspiration for modern designers and carvers.\n\nProfessor Pietro Giusti exhibited several carved frames in a similar style. He was awarded a medal at the exhibition, but very little more is known about him. All the mirrors were carved, as this one is, in the style of about 1500. Siena had always been famous for wood carvers. There were several carving workshops there in the middle of the 19th century, when woodcarving was undergoing a revival all over Europe. They produced fine-quality work in historic styles, mainly for rich, middle-class customers. The finer details of the carving are shown in relief against a gilded ground. The painting was not originally with the frame. Although it is contemporary with the style of the frame, it was heavily over-painted in the middle of the 19th century.",
