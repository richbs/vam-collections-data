The veining and modelling is painted with fine hatched or stippled strokes together with areas of transparent washes.  It is set against the plain ground of the mottled off-white paper in a frame created by strips of pale brown paper outlined in black with two further rulings in black on the plain ivory-coloured ground of the main border of the page. The margins of the two short sides and that on the left hand side of the page have strips of blue-grey paper collaged on them with a black ruled line on their inner edges.  An additional strip of grey paper has been added on the left hand side as a gutter for the present album binding, with a similar strip stuck on the right hand margin.",

It contains 56 leaves on which are Mughal miniature paintings, drawing and flower studies on both sides. The binding is covered with an Indian brocade silk that may have been cut from lengths brought home by the 2nd Lord Clive, who served as Governor of Madras, 1799 to 1803.  The album was sold from Powis Castle at Sotheby's sale, 16 to 18 January 1956, lot 332A.",
