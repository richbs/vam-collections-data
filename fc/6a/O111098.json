On the left Longinus, besides whom stands the Virgin, pierces Christ's side; further to the left is one of the crucified thieves. To the right Stephaton hold the sponge, beside him is St John weeping, at the extreme right the second thief. In the middle compartment an angel, holding the cross in his left hand and pointing with his right to the group of the Holy Women, sits upon the open tomb, above which rises a low turret with a cupola; to the right are two sleeping soldiers. Above are soldiers casting lots for Christ's cloth. On the right is the expulsion of the Synagogue by a figure, symbolising the Church holding a trident; the Synagogue is shown a seated figure with a nimbus representing the City of Jerusalem, holding a banner and attended by an armed man. Below, in the right- and left-hand corners, are seated the personifications of Earth and Sea. The whole is emclosed in a border of foliage.",

            "public_access_description": "Ivory was used all over Europe for religious works of art. It was often combined with precious metals and usually took the form of relief panels, for book covers, portable altars and caskets. An almost unbroken tradition of ivory carving extends from the Roman and Byzantine empires until the end of the 14th century. From about 1250, Paris became the centre of production for figures and reliefs intended for private devotion. The reverse shows the upper half of a leaf of a consular diptych of about 520-30.\n\nThe ivory formed part of a book cover together with an ivory depicting scenes from the Passion of Christ in the British Museum.\n\nThe Crucifixion side is a good example for the iconography and the production of ivory in the late ninth-century Metz. Some elements of the iconographic formula such as the personifications of Sea and Earth and the Crucifixion are based on ivories of the Liuthar group, i.e.from the cover of the pericopes of Henry II in the Residenzmuseum in Munich of about 860. More important is the re-use of a leaf of an early sixth-century Consular diptych for the new carvings with scenes from the Passion of Christ and related events.",
