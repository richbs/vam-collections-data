There is a flat framed pilaster with a vertical flute in its centre at the left hand side and a frieze of framed rosettes running along the base.  The centre of the scene shows a standing mustachioed Buddha with an aureole behind his head. He is holding a loop of his <i>sanghati</i> in his left hand while his right hand is raised in <i>abhayamudra</i>. His direction of view is directed towards a kneeling bearded ascetic who raise his hands in devotion. He is kneeling on a sword-like object and a shield with a curvaceous top lies in front of him. Above him the torsos of  two figures who have lost their heads are carved out from the back slab. The one on the extreme left, possibly a woman, holds a cloth, while the adjacent figure appears to be Vajrapani holding a thunderbolt( now missing) in his right hand. Behind the figure of Buddha there are two standing monks with shaven heads of slightly smaller stature than the Buddha with the torsos of a further two monks in low relief above them. The robes are all carved in a similar manner with rows of parallel folds.",
