            "public_access_description": "Tobacco smoking arrived as a popular pastime in Europe in the latter part of the seventeenth-century. The clay pipes used to consume the 'brown gold' were easily broken, and so pipe cases were developed to offer them protection. This particular example was a carved in the Dutch East Indies (modern day Indonesia) in the period 1670-1700. Non-indigenous cash crops such as tobacco were introduced to the colony by the United East India Company.\n\nThe carving is quite fine, and the inclusion of a mount made of silver suggests that this could have been a souvenir made for a wealthy merchant. Its length is also indicative of wealth, as a more impractical longer pipe was favoured by a class of person who could afford to break a few fragile stems. The scenes depicted are of a generally European flavour, which suggests a firm awareness of the the maker's expected customers' tastes. The choice to use ebony, a tree native to Indonesia, adds a further exotic aspect to this piece.",

Short pipes, on the other hand, could be carried outdoors inside a pocket.\n\nPipes of the seventeenth-century generally had an upward-facing bowl, and this is reflected in the style of this case. The lack of ventilation also points to an origin of around that time.",
