In the background left people are carrying goods or counting money and on the right a man is handing money over to one of the men on the platform. A couple leave via steps to the right of the background; over the staircase is a window through which an onlooker watches the scene. Through a square opening on the left is a landscape with tree. The image is bordered by parallel lines forming a moulded frame.\n\nThis print is in reverse of the cartoon from which it is derived but faithful in compositional details, while raising the height slightly to show more of the top of the drape and the figures climbing the stairs, and to give a step to the front.",

            "public_access_description": "This image represents the moment when Ananias is struck down and dies after lying to Saint Peter about the proportion of money he is donating to the Church.  \n\nThe so-called Raphael Cartoons, from which this print is taken, are seven full size designs for tapestries by the great Italian Renaissance artist Raphael (1483-1520). They illustrate passages from the Bible concerning the lives of Saint Peter and Saint Paul. None of them is smaller than ten feet high by thirteen feet wide. They belong to Her Majesty the Queen and have been on loan to this museum since 1865. The earliest print relating to the Raphael Cartoons dates from 1516, the year in which Raphael received final payment for the commission. It inaugurates an extraordinary case study in the history of printmaking, stretching over more than four hundred and fifty years and across a wide range of printmaking techniques.\n\nSimon Gribelin was the first printmaker to issue a complete set of prints of the Cartoons. When they came out in 1707 they carried a letterpress titlepage dedicating them to Queen Anne. Although they met with success it was nothing compared to that which greeted the set produced by Nicholas Dorigny in 1719. \n\nGribelin was born in France but came to England around 1680. He was the most important silver engraver in London at the beginning of the eighteenth century. This meant engraving on the surfaces of watches, tea caddies, salvers etc. He was also a printmaker. In the 1690s he published two prints after history paintings by Charles Le Brun, then in 1706 he engraved an altar dish with a scene of the Deposition based on a picture by Annibale Carracci. These may have led to the idea of engraving the Cartoons.\n\nThe antiquarian George Vertue wrote in his notebooks \"in London about 1700, the state of Print Engraving on Copper was at a low ebb\u2026 til about 1707. Mr Griblins cartons in print from the pictures of Raphael were well received, and vast numbers of them [sold].\"\n\nAs well as visual information each print delivers written information in the form of a caption in English and Latin giving the title, the biblical reference, the names of the artist and the engraver, and stating the location of the Cartoons.\n\nHorace Walpole, writing in 1763, said of these prints \"their success was very great having never been completely engraved before; but they were too small a volume, nor had Gribelin anything of greatness in his manner or capacity: His works have no merit than finicalness, and that not in perfection, can give them.\" Dr. Johnson defined finicialness as \"superfluous nicety or foppery\".\n\nEach of the individual engravings shows the Cartoon in reverse while the view of the Cartoon gallery shows them the right way round. \n\nIn March 1735 Gribelin's son was selling sets of his late father's prints of the Cartoons for 15 shillings. By 1753 they had dropped to half a guinea (ten shillings and sixpence) in the price list of the print-publisher John Bowles. The following year in the catalogue of the print-publisher Henry Overton II, they were listed under \"Cheap Sets of Prints\".",
