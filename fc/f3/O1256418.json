The initials F.H. are inscribed on the front in ink. \nThe inside front cover features a pencil drawing of a scroll, containing the words 'F. Hood 1843 Ashbourne'. The facing page re-iterates, Francis Hood 1843, inside a spirited pen drawing of a swan. \n\nThe work in the book is divided into sections. Each is opened with a decorated title, often in purple ink, and introductory passage establishing the rules, before moving to worked examples. Calculations are written throughout in black ink, with underlining in red or blue. There are no corrections or blotting, suggesting that this book was used to copy out rough workings done elsewhere. \n\n[first section] Direct Proportion\nThe questions are written on faint ruled pencil lines, and the calculations are written within a grid of rules squares.\n\nCommodities that are mentioned include: tobacco, iron, coffee, Cheshire cheese, lead, gold, sugar, raisins, silver, wool, stockings, candles, muslin, broard cloth, shalloon, Holland and plush. \nOther transactions include daily budgeting, currency conversions, interest, work rates and travel times.\n\n[second section] Practice\nInvolves the use of aliquot parts (divisors), and eight further Rules. The exercises are shorter in this section, and condensed up to ten on a page, in columns.\n\n[third section] Tare and Tret\nCalculations to determine how the trading conventions of tare, tret and cloff impact on gross weight, neat weight, and prices. Worked examples are interspersed with Rules.\n\n[fourth section] Commission\nInvolves calculating percentages for agents, or business transactions. Generally using figures from 2 1/2 to 4 per cent.\n\n[fifth section] Brokerage\nCalculations of an allowance for a Broker, who negotiates prices and terms of transactions. Calculations based on figures from 1/8 to 2 per cent. \n\n[sixth section] Stocks\n\"The stocks, or public finds, are dets of government\". Calculations on valuation of stocks and costs of brokerage. Stocks used as examples include Bank Stock, India Stock, Navy, and Consols.\n\n[seventh section] Simple Interest\nCalculating the annual cost of borrowing money, typically 4 or 5 per cent, over terms in both years and days.",

This book belonged to Francis (b. 1832), and demonstrates the rules and practice of calculating interest, wastage, brokerage and commission on a wide range of nineteenth century commodities. \n\nThe work in the book is conscientiously inscribed; titles are decorated with a flourish and there are no crossings out or corrections. This suggests this was a neat work book, with the process of working out done elsewhere, perhaps on a slate.",
