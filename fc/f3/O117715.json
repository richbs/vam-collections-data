By the 1830s sleeves had reached such exaggerated proportions that women were compared to \u2018ants\u2019 and \u2018bottle spiders\u2019 with their tiny waists and bell-shaped skirts. There were at least a dozen different patterns for day-wear sleeves with romantic names such as  'Cavalier\u2019, \u2018Donna Maria\u2019, \u2018Sultan\u2019, \u2018Medici\u2019 and \u2018Marino Fali\u00e9ro\u2019. \n \nThese are examples of \u2018Gigot\u2019 (\u2018leg of mutton\u2019) sleeves. They were very full at the shoulder, diminishing in size towards the elbow and becoming tight at the wrist. They are made in two pieces and the fabric is matched on the front seam so that the join is barely visible.\n\nSleeves of this size had to be supported as they were often made of flimsy fabric. Some styles had stiff buckram undersleeves or hoops to give them their shape. The sleeves shown here are unlined, so the wearer probably attached a large down-filled pad to each arm just below the shoulder line to distend them. Feathers can be easily compressed so the pad could be squeezed through the narrow armhole of the dress.",
