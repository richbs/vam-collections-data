The design was executed for a production of the pantomime \"Dick Whittington\" performed at the Birmingham Hippodrome on 22nd  December 1993.  The show was directed by Carole Todd, and the lighting was designed by Andrew Gardner.  The cast included Lesley Joseph as Fairy Bow Bells, John Nettles as King Rat, Rosemarie Ford as Dick, Jeffrey Holland as Ada the Cook, and Wayne Sleep as Tommy the Cat.\n\nThe production was filmed for inclusion in the National Video Archive of Stage Performance at the Theatre Museum in February 1994  (Catalogue numbers 94/04/V/9001  and 94/04/V/9002 ). These designs were partly acquired as a compliment to the film with the aim of recording the creative progress from the designer's drawings to their realisation on stage.\n\nHistorical significance: An excellent example of late 20th century costume design for pantomime, which is currently poorly represented in the Theatre Museum Collection.",
