This involved cutting lighter woods, such as boxwood or spindle-wood, into a background of darker woods like walnut. The subjects were often depicted surrounded with scrolls or wreaths and often included grand church silver - in this case a censer for burning incence and a nef, for storing a prince's or bishop's salts and cutlery.  This type of intarsia was then known as tarsia di silio or spindle-wood inlay, and mostly used for decorating individual panels in church sacresties or choir stalls. Although widely used throughout Italy between about 1450 and 1540, intarsia fell out of fashion because the woods gradually lost their original colours and became increasingly vulnerable to woodworm infestation.",
