The parallel lines of stitches are approximately half a centimetre apart.\nThe top part of the coat, back and front, bears a painted resist-dyed design of a dragon with a pearl among cloud swirls. The lower half of the coat has a large geometric design of vertical and horizontal bands of grey resisted against the blue background.\nThe coat is simply cut in the usual Japanese style with a centre back seam and no shoulder seams. There are no inserts at the front but a long collar band extends to the hemline. The cuffs and hem are bound with blue cotton.",

It is made from several layers of thick cotton quilted together using a technqiue known as \u2018sashiko\u2019. Before tackling a blaze a fireman would be drenched in water to protect him from the flames, the quilting of the jacket allowing for maximum absorption. Wearing this heavy garment the fireman would attack the blaze, using a long pole to pull down buildings to prevent the fire from spreading. The design of the jacket provided more than just physical protection. The motif of a dragon, a magical beast who brought storms when it descended from the heavens, served to wrap the fireman in divine protection. The jacket is reversible, and during a fire the plain side would be revealed. When the fire had been defeated - and on festival days - the dynamic image would be revealed.",
