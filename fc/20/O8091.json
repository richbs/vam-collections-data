Vases of this design were sold singly, but they may have been flanked by other, smaller vases when displayed in interiors. They would probably have been placed on chimneypieces or similar domestic furnishings.  A factory list of 1819 describes vases of this shape as 'Large Fountain Vases'. They were in production by 1773, and they were still being made in 1795.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe market for vases in the 'antique' style grew rapidly in the late 1760s, as the Neo-classical style gained ground. The demand for them was so great that, in addition to copying genuine Greek and Roman antiquities, manufacturers copied vase designs of the 16th to 18th centuries, usually prints. The Derby porcelain factory copied the design from a print published in Paris after 1752 by the French sculptor Jacques Saly (1717-1776).\n\nTrading\nThese complex vases were expensive to make, but they reached very high prices at London auctions of Derby porcelain. Examples were sold for \u00a317 17s and \u00a319 19s in 1773. At that time the Derby factory's modellers were earning a weekly wage of  \u00a32 11s. In 1790 the manager of Derby's London showrooms waited 'on Lord Dover with the Cupid & Dolphin Jar', for it was common then for clients to have goods brought to their homes and clubs for inspection.",
