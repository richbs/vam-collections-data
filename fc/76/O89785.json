The sitter wears a rich woven silk waistcoat trimmed with gold fringes, which provides a good example of French fashion during the first quarter of the 18th century. The sitter could not be identified but he was probably an important figure of the exiled Stuart court in France of which Belle was the official painter.",

The garment worn by the sitter in this painting is particularly remarkable from this point of view and is the reason why the painting was acquired by the V&A at the instigation of the Textiles section. \n\nIt is an accurate representation of the magnificent woven silk waistcoat with gold fringes, made from a French silk that can be dated 1710-1712 by comparison with designs by James Leman (1688-1745). It would have been very expensive, perhaps equivalent to two years wages for a skilled artisan. \n\nSimilar precious silk dress can be seen in other portraits by Belle including <i>Louis XV and the Infante Marie-Anne-Victoire</i>, Mus\u00e9e National des Ch\u00e2teaux de Versailles et de Trianon, Versailles (Inv. 9380), executed between 1722 and 1725, and <i>Portrait of Captain Hercules Baker (1689-1744)</i>, Christie's London, 26 Nov 2002, lot 11.\n\nAlthough the sitter could not be identified, it has been suggested that he may have been a diplomat who attended the negotiations which led to the Treaty of Utrecht at the end of the Wars of the Spanish succession. Belle was working in Paris at this time when he painted the portrait of Matthew Prior now in Cambridge.",
