In the late 1960s, they created psychedelic posters for many of the English bands of the time, and decorated and advertised Nigel Waymouth's King's Road boutique, Granny Takes a Trip. They also designed for concerts held at the UFO club and Saville Theatre, and for underground magazine Oz. Their influences came from the decorative and eroticised designs of Art Nouveau, combined with the melting rainbow colours of LSD visions and pop art inspirations from the post-war media; traces of Disney, horror movie monsters and comic book characters and can often be seen  hiding amongst the images.\n\nSoft Machine were an English rock band from Canterbury, named after the book The Soft Machine by William S. Burroughs. They formed in 1966, and were one of the central bands in the Canterbury scene, helping pioneer the progressive rock genre. They played regularly at both UFO and Middle Earth clubs, and combined Jazz and Rock music into a proto-progressive style.",
