Once a large fishing port with a boat-building industry, Staithes was home to many fishermen. Their garment of choice was this type of thick sweater, which was close-fitting for warmth and tightly knitted to repel water. \n \nThe traditional colour of the gansey is navy. This one is worked in the round, without side seams, in a pattern of vertical panels with alternate cable and double moss stitch. \n\nThe name 'gansey' comes from Guernsey, one of the islands from which these jumpers originated. Women knitted the jumpers for their fisherman husbands during the 19th century, but during the 1880s there was a craze for a fashionable female version of the jersey.  \n\nThe cable pattern was later adopted to decorate cricket jumpers. By the 20th century, work wear like ganseys and aran jumpers had become established as leisure dress for the middle classes.",
