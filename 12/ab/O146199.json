Imitation blossom was normally made from wax, paper, or cloth, but this example is made entirely from feathers and silk ribbons on fine wire. The white feathers have been carefully dyed in shades of green for leaves, or tinted with touches of yellow to replicate petals.  It is associated with the 1854 marriage of Elizabeth Wroughton Richards to Edward Nug\u00e9e. \n\nThe wreath could have been purchased from a milliner's establishment, or made at home by a particularly talented home handicrafter. Women's periodicals in the 19th century provided instructions for various handicrafts, including featherwork. They advised their readers on how to clean and dye feathers, and how to make them into various accessories or dress-trimmings. Typically the feathers were stitched down flat into mosaic-like patterns, so the three dimensional quality of this wreath is unusual.",

Edward Tew Richards, Rector of Farlington (the next door parish to Wymering). The Richards were Rectors from 1782 to 1925. Following her husband's death, she went on to marry a Dr. Field in 1867, and died 10 years later.\n\nAndrew Nug\u00e9e (b.31/10/1813 - d.25/12/1858) was the 2nd son of Francis James Nug\u00e9e who came from a family of Huguenot tailors who emigrated from Bordeaux to Cork between 1748-1752. They made a name for themselves with \"Nug\u00e9e's waistcoats\" in the early 19th century. He was at Brasenose College, and became a curate in Lambeth prior to becoming Vicar of Wymering in 1851. The living was purchased by his father in the 1840s with a view to presenting his son as Vicar when the next vacancy should occur.\n\nHistorical significance: Extremely rare and beautiful example of 19th century feather work",
