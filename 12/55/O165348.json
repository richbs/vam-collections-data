Though many figures of this period can be attributed to the modellers J.J. Sp\u00e4ngler or William Coffee, Timothy Clifford believed this piece to be modelled by a different hand and similar in style to a set of four plaster figures signed by Francis Hardenburg and dated 1805 at Heaton Hall, Lancashire. Brian Bricknell notes in his biography of William Coffee that 'with its incised figure 385 it is later than both Rossi and Hardenburg and suggests a date of about 1795 (or late 1794). He proposed that Coffee probably modelled it based on something Rossi did in 1788 and added that he added the dove and sheep in ignorance of Hygeia's story. The figure was originally dated ca. 1815-1820 when entered on the Collections Information System.",
