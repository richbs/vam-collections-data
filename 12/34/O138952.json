It was worn by the fashion journalist Eleanor Lambert to American writer Truman Capote\u2019s Black & White Ball.\n\nThe designer, Norman Norell, was a central figure in the development of the American high end fashion industry. He worked to a high standard, creating simple, stylish clothing. His daywear was immaculately tailored and finished, and his evening wear often used sequins to great effect. In 1943 he won the first Coty American Fashion Critics Award ever presented, and by 1956, had been inducted into the Coty Hall of Fame. Designers such as Norell offered a streamlined, restrained American alternative to Paris extravagance.\n\nEleanor Lambert (1903-2003) devoted her life to championing and promoting American fashion design.  She created the Best Dressed List (1940), and was involved in founding the Coty Awards and the bi-annual American Fashion Weeks. Her legacy was to ensure that American fashion at its best became recognised as a worthy equal to Paris couture.\n\nThe Black & White Ball, held on November 28, 1966 in the Grand Ballroom of New York City's Plaza Hotel, was considered the social event of not only that season but of many to follow. The guest list brought together the \u00e9lites of politics, show business and money, all of whom were required to wear black and white clothing and masks. The party was widely covered by the media.\n\nEleanor later donated her dress to a fellow guest, Cecil Beaton, when he was putting together the Beaton Collection. Beaton acquired garments from designers and the well-dressed \u00e9lite of Europe and America.  The collection was exhibited at the V&A in 1971, and was subsequently presented to the Museum.",

            "historical_context_note": "Eleanor Lambert (August 10, 1903 - October 7, 2003) was a U.S. fashion pioneer. Perhaps her greatest legacy to history was her invention of the Best Dressed List in 1940. She was born in 1903 in Crawfordsville, Indiana and died aged 100 in New York City.\n\nOn November 28, 1966, in honor of Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham, Capote hosted a legendary masked ball, called the Black & White Ball, in the Grand Ballroom of New York City's Plaza Hotel. It was considered the social event of not only that season but of many to follow. The New York Times and other publications gave it considerable coverage, and Deborah Davis wrote an entire book about the event, Party of the Century (2006), excerpted by The Independent. Different accounts of the evening were collected by George Plimpton in his book Truman Capote.\n\nCapote dangled the prized invitations for months, snubbing early supporters like Carson McCullers as he determined who was \"in\" and who was \"out.\" In choosing his guest of honor, Capote eschewed glamorous \"swans\" like Babe Paley and Fiat heiress Marella Agnelli in favor of Katharine Graham. Actress Candice Bergen was bored at the ball. Capote's elevator man danced the night away with a woman who didn't know his pedigree. Norman Mailer sounded off about Vietnam, and Frank Sinatra danced with his young wife, Mia Farrow.",
