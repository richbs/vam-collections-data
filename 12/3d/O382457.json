They usually wore them on a black velvet ribbon, fastened tightly round the neck like a choker, with a slide at the front.  The ribbon passes through the bale of the cross, and is then threaded through a hole or loop at the base of the slide, and out at either side.  The ribbon is tied in a bow at the back of the neck.\n\nThis cross comes from Normandy, which was famous for the size and variety of its crosses in the 19th century.  In the 18th century they were usually comparatively small, like this one, and often set with local rock crystals.",
