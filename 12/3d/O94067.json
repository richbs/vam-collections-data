The C-spring chassis supports a rectangular wooden body upholstered in navy blue leathercloth, the exterior decorated in unpigmented reedwork; the back of the body is suspended from the frame on two leather straps.  The body has a flat bed to take a recumbent baby, but the central panel is removable to give access to the well space so that the mailcart could take a seated older child or children.  The wheels have metal rims and spokes and rubber tyres, and are paired, with the two large wheels beneath the body of the pram and the two small ones at the front for greater manoeverability (as in full-sized wheeled vehicles).  The apron and hood are of navy blue leathercloth: the hood is edged with 'Greek key' patterned braid, and is supported on a folding frame of metal hoops with a hinged metal strut at each side.",
