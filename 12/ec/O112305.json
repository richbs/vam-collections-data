This lithograph shows how the forms and proportions of classical mouldings were used in ordinary rooms in the 19th century. \n\nThis print shows an architrave. The word is derived from Greek (and means \u2018chief beam\u2019) and has two meanings in architectural orders. It can either mean the lowest of the three parts of an entablature, which rests on top of a column (the others being frieze, in the middle and cornice, at the top) or as in this case, the moulded frame around a door or a window.",
