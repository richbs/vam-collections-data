Pieced carefully with two other pieces from very similarly patterned embroidery.  The differences can best be seen on the back [the threads are thicker in the added pieces].\nThe main pattern is a series of diagonal lines from lower right to upper left.  These are chevron lines in blue and dark blue edged in white or faded red. There are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: white ground, alternate blocks of a large flowering stem and bud in light brown, cream edged in faded red, separated by a row of small blue/yellow triangles leading into a large flower fan and buds in faded reds, pinks and orange against dark green leaves and outlines.\n[2] wider stripes with two designs: [a] dark green ground, alternate lozenge patterns of a symmetrical stylised pink [or faded red?] rose flanked by a two white blossoms and clusters of leaves in blue, yellow and pink/red leaves and a stylised white flowering shrub with 2 yellow forms, possibly birds, in opposite corners.\n[b] dark green ground but the repeating lozenges contain  a small blue/yellow vase holding variously coloured flower heads and a different arrangement of white blossoms surrounding a faded pink flower head.\nThere is a narrow border down the lower part of each side.  \nThe bottom border has a yellow ground with alternating trefoil shapes in faded red or beige/cream with a repeat inverted V-shape in white/blue between them top and bottom.\nThreads: 2S silk: white, red, pink [both faded], yellow, dark blue, blue, light green, dark green, light brown, mauve, black, cream.",
