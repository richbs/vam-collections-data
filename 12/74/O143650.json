Jewellery was no longer just a sign of wealth and status. It now had sculptural qualities and narrative elements, often critical of modern life and conditions. \n\nThe widely used term \u2018New Jewellery\u2019 (\u2018Neuer Schmuck\u2019) evokes the spirit of the period. Jewellery makers sought freedom in their artistic expression, emphasising the individual approach and experimenting in forms, materials and techniques. New galleries dedicated to the sale of contemporary jewellery emerged in the major German cities. \n\nHubertus Skal was trained by the Munich jeweller Carl Hemmerle before graduating from the Staatliche Fachhochschule f\u00fcr Glas und Schmuck, Neugablonz and the Akademie der Bildenden K\u00fcnste in Munich. He stayed in Munich where he was co-founder of the Galerie Cadillac. \n\nHis jewellery is not about fine craftsmanship, even though he was an excellent craftsman who used precious metals when other artist jewellers were experimenting with alternative materials. Wearability was equally not a concern, some of his pieces are simply sculptural objects. Von Skal\u2019s jewellery is more about symbols and metaphors, as thought-provoking ideas for the viewer. Eye-catching miniature human figures, animal forms, flowers and abstract symbols abound in his artistic concepts.",
