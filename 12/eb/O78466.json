It was widely used for hunting and when travelling as it was more convenient than the longer rapier.  The 'hanger' was very popular in England in the middle of the 17th century.\n\nHistorical Associations\nOliver Cromwell's victory over the Royalists at the battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651 was the 'crowning mercy' that effectively ended the English Civil War.  On 15 September, Cromwell made a triumphant entry into London and Parliament granted him Hampton Court as a residence and \u00a34,000 a year.\n\nTrade\nPeter Henckels was a member of a long established family of blade-makers from Solingen in Germany.  This was then a famous centre for the manufacture of sword blades and Solingen cutlers had contracts with London retailers to mount  their blades in English hilts.",
