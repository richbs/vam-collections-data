Nevetheless they are true-to-life in their depiction of battles and atrocities, and the grim aftermath of war as experienced by soldiers, civilians, and those on the losing side. Callot was familiar with Dutch and Flemish miltary prints by artists such as Esaias and Jan van de Velde (c.1590-1630; c.1593-1642), David Vincnkboons (1578-1629) and Claes Jansz. Visscher (1586-1652), and may have may have been inspired by them.\n\nIn the inventory of his possessions following his death, this series is called La vie des soldat [The life of soldiers] and the focus of the series is the lives of soldiers in the 17th century from the time they enlist until they receive rewards meted out by a commander. They are shown in battle, wantonly destroying civilian property, and indulging in murder and rape of the civilian population. In turn they are attacked by civilians and punished as criminals by the military authorities. Survivors of battle, battered and mutilated, lead a pitiful existence, begging, and dying in the streets.\n\nThe captions to the prints, in rhyming couplets composed by the Abb\u00e9 Michel de Marolles, were added in the second states.",
