The simple form was created from a single piece of die-cut, folded card but required complex development. In 1967 the designer Peter Murdoch extended the range, which was marketed as Those Things: Fibreboard Furniture for the Young. The range of Chair Things, Stool Things and Table Things emphasised the multi-purpose, play-orientated function and reflected relaxing social attitudes towards children.\n\nOver 76,000 pieces were sold in six months in 1967, retailing at less than \u00a31 each.  Despite several awards the potential for mass-production in the 1970s was never fully realised. Pop furniture was designed to be disposable so few examples have survived.",
