The panel is pierced with a keyhole at the centre, near the top. The top edge is lightly punched with a repeating star ornament.  The panel is painted mid-brown.  Where this paint has worn off at the lower edge, there are traces of a pink stain. The back of the panel is not coloured or painted.\n\nThe lower corners on either side extend approximately 3 cm, showing the receiving recesses for dovetails (trimmed off higher up the panel).  \n\nThe panel is broken into two pieces with an irregular horizontal break just above the remaining dovetail extensions.   The lower edge shows old worm damage. On the underside it shows the remains of wooden pins at irregular intervals (13 cm in one case), which are the remains of the pins attaching the base.  The back face shows a chiselled recess for a lock (now missing).  The upper part of the panel, behind the left (PR) side, is cut with an L-shaped rebate for a till, the recesses approximately 1.4 cm wide and 0.5 cm deep",

The front is carved with a design centreing on a vase of flowers, set within a formal garden, with pavilions and cypress trees.  The urn with flowers was based on baroque designs first used in the 17th century.  In many areas of Europe, from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean, baroque style motifs continued in popular use throughout the 18th century.  Here they are combined with tall cypress trees, a motif echoing Middle Eastern design. Underneath the lower edge of the panel are remnants of wooden pins which would have fixed this panel to the plank that formed the base of the chest.  This form of construction ('plank construction') was the simplest method for making box forms and survived in popular use even when more sophisticated 'frame and panel' construction had been adopted in the main centres of cabinet-making.",
