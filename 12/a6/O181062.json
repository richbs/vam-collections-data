The Whitechapel Art Gallery, London:\nThe chair is made with frame in either oak or beech, in a variety of finishes, including nine lacquer colours in the case of the beech. The armrest is bent under steam pressure. It was first shown at The Furniture Fair at Fredericia, Denmark 1951.\n\u2018This chair is the perfect solution of a task: the light, lowbacked armchair, sufficiently comfortable. It weighs nine pounds, just like a new born child. An architect can gain a nice reputation for himself by making this chair five times as heavy, half as comfortable and one quarter good looking. Look at it once more. It is completely faultless. Its form is spare and harmonious. It does not have any false or mendacious pretences. It fulfils its task in society with the modest conscientiousness expected of the good citizen.
