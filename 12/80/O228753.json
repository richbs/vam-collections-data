Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. Above all, they had to have the means for attaching a cord. Netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated being the katabori (shape carving), a three-dimensional carving, such as this one in the form of Hotei, god of prosperity. \n\nThis  netsuke is probably an ingenious imitation of the large pottery models which were made in Bizen province during the 19th century. The ceramic nature of of the original is indicated by the seams along the sides and the brown stains and by the fact that the netsuke is hollow.\n\nFrom the 1700s onwards, netsuke were increasingly signed with the artist's name. This example is signed Kohosai, who died ca. 1907.",
