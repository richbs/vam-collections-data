As the name suggests, the church of Saint-Pierre-du-Chatel was dedicated to St Peter. This panel is one of three that depict important episodes relating to Peter and the early years of the Christian church. \n \nBefore Christ ascended to heaven, he instructed his disciples to spread his teachings around the world. Peter is shown here in the second panel preaching about the life, death and Resurrection of Christ.",

ISBN 1851774041\nBernard Rackham, A Guide to the Collecitons of Stained Glass, V&A Museum, 1936\n(p.70) The introduction into French art about 1520 of the early Renaissance style from Italy had at first little effect on glass-painting. Its influence is seen in the adoption of classical instead of Gothic motives in ornamental accessories of costume, architectural canopies, or borders, but the technique and the general colour values of stained glass continued for some time on purely medieval lines. This is well seen in a series of three lights, of about 1525, from a church in Normandy, with scenes from the life and martyrdom of St  Peter. In their rich colouring they approximate to many windows of the period to be seen in the parish churches of Rouen; only in the small classical details of architectural accessories and ornamental borders do they show the change to the fashions of the Renaissance.",
