The front shows a white, black and tan puppy, wearing a red bow, and with a present at his feet, looking though a cut-out window at a blue kitten on the inside of the card; the wording reads\n1 today  HAPPY BIRTHDAY\nwith the figure one printed in red.  Inside, the puppy (now wearing a green bow and carrying a present in his mouth) is greeting two pop-up kittens: the blue one, wearing a red check bow, who was visible through the window, and a tabby wearing a blue bow; the verse reads:\n\"WON'T YOU PLEASE COME OUT TO PLAY ?\nSAYS TIM, THE PUP, \"YOU'RE ONE TO-DAY !\nWE'LL HAVE SUCH FUN THE WHOLE DAY THROUGH\nA HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DEAR,  to You !\"",
