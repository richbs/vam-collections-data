In a carefully contrived composition the girls rest on what appears to be a studio prop, probably a box or trunk draped with a blanket. The same draped box or trunk appears in several other Hawarden photographs, for instance Ph 457-1968:264 (D.273) and Ph 457\u00ad1968:444 (D.277). The same sort of prop was used by O.G. Rejlander in his After Raphael's Sistine Madonna (1857), of which the Hawardens had a copy (see Ph 457-1968:499 (D.356\u00bb).
