This was a vast visual encyclopaedia of the ancient and natural worlds, consisting of thousands of drawings and prints. Originally attributed to the circle of Giulio Romano, the drawing can be dated on stylistic grounds from the mid 16th century.\n\nThis sheet was folio 77 of Cassiano's 'sculpture' album, and the first in a sequence of about fourteen sheets from an album bearing designs for acanthus scrollwork. Although all bear modern designs for acanthus scrollwork, they were closely inspired by similarly designed pilasters and friezes of certain ancient Roman buildings and by spolia from antiquities used in building early medieval churches.\n\nThis drawing's later provenance is exceptionally distinguished.  It belonged to Pope Clement XI, Cardinal Albani and King George III; later still to the collector of antiquities Charles Townley (1737-1805), and to the art historian Sir William Stirling Maxwell (1818-1878). The contents of the album, including this drawing, were dispersed in 1990.",
