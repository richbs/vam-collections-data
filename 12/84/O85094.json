ISBN 1851773088.\nThe buildings of architect Charles Harrison Townsend are recognised as among the most spectacular of the British Arts and Crafts movement. His two best-known London examples, the Horniman Museum and the Whitechapel Art Gallery, are now considered extremely significant expressions of the style. The manufacturer Alexander Morton was an avid follower of William Morris, and he set up his firm with Morris's principles in mind. With important technological developments in dyeing and weaving techniques, and patronage of the most influential contemporary designers, the products of Morton & Co. reflect an ideal union of traditional patterns advanced by modern interpretation.\nThe name of the Omar textile-an elegant pattern of stylized lotus blossoms, on a deep red ground, aligned in ogival repeats derived from sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Turkish sources-may have been suggested by the popularity of The Rub iy t of Omar Khayy m, translated by British poet Edward FitzGerald and first published in 1859. Omar, along with its original design drawing, was part of a large collection of Morton & Co. products given in the 1960s and 1970s by Jocelyn Morton and Courtaulds Ltd., a gift that filled a major gap in the V&A's holdings of English Arts and Crafts, one of the most original and popular British movements of modern times.\n\nLit.
