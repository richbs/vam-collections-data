Their exquisite tonal quality, impressive scale and innovative exposure and printing methods set high technical standards, while also elevating the evocative and poetic capacity of the new medium. \n\nLe Gray was born in 1820 near Paris and trained there as a painter. Around 1847 he took up photography. His seascapes were, and are still, his greatest public, commercial and aesthetic success. He took them on the French coast at Normandy in the summer of 1856 and a second set from the Mediterranean coast in spring 1857, though it is not known at which location this image was made.  \n\nDespite its title, the image shows almost no sea and is more of a cloud study, concentrating upon the massive, billowing formations. In his writing, Le Gray set out a \u2018theory of sacrifices\u2019. This suggested that in a work of art detail could be sacrificed in the interests of the overall impression of light and shade. Here he illustrates that theory using the most ethereal of subject matters.",

They combine exquisite tonal quality, large scale and complex technical processes, and illustrate the aesthetic potential of photography and its links to contemporary painting. He took them on the French coast at Normandy in the summer of 1856 and a second set from the Mediterranean coast in spring 1857, though it is not known at which location this image was made. The seascapes were Le Gray's greatest success - they result perhaps from a combination of his training as a painter and his technical skill in judging exposure and in printing. Using two negatives (one for sky and one for sea, as each required different exposure times due to their differing brightness and reflectivity) Le Gray captured this poetic subject with outstanding results.",
