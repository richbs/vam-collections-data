Her work in print is informed by her previous training in sculpture, and her current work is focused on the implications of digital media on our perceptions of space and embodiment \u2013 all issues explored in this subtle complex print. She works with 3D modelling programs to explore definitions of the \u2018virtual\u2019 and the \u2018real\u2019 as demonstrated here between different methods and styles of representation. This print, \u2018any which way (\u2018speak modernity\u2019)', is a 7-layer screenprint, with imagery derived from photography and digital media, and as such exemplifies her interest in the relationship between digital technologies and older forms of print technology. It has been printed as a photographic halftone with 2 layers of varnish on the top part of the cube. The right-hand shapes have been printed from handmade positives drawn from the photographic image and coloured with the process colours Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black. It incorporates a 1940\u2032s advertisement by Bakelite Plastics projecting a vision for the future. Stockham has reworked the geometric shapes within the photographic halftone and developed another projected future; one fuelled by the reductive and purist qualities of the Modernist era.",
