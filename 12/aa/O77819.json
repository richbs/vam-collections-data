A version of this composition was in the Royal collection in the 1640s, among the small-scale sculpture placed on the window sills of the throne room at the palace of Whitehall in London.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nVenus, the Roman goddess of love and fertility and mother of Cupid, fell in love with Adonis after being accidently grazed by Cupid's arrow.  Adonis was killed by a wild boar while out hunting.\n\nPeople\nFanelli was born in Florence. He worked in Genoa, using marble, ivory and silver, as well as bronze, before coming to England in the early 1630s.  Although he was said to have 'livd and dyd in England', it has sometimes been assumed that he left the country at the outbreak of the Civil War. The recent discovery of his baptismal records, revealing his birth date of 1577, make it more likely that he died around 1641, when he was last documented.\n\nTime\nIn the late 16th century, the Florentine sculptor Giovanni Bologna (1529-1608) and his followers were responsible for a significant output of sophisticated and high quality statuettes. These were dispersed throughout Europe and Charles I inherited a group from his elder brother, Henry, who died in 1612. They doubtless influenced both the King's taste and Francesco Fanelli's production.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe lost wax method of casting is a complicated procedure that creates a bronze sculpture using a  wax model taken from the original design.  In Fanelli's workshop, waxes were cast in moulds taken from individual elements of the original, which could have been made of clay or wax.  By assembling the wax sections slightly differently, Fanelli was able to produce variations of the same composition.",
