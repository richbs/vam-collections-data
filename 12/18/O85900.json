Fritware, also called stone paste and quartz paste, was developed by Middle Eastern potters as a response to the challenge posed by Chinese porcelain. In the 12th and early 13th centuries, potters in Kashan and other centres in Iran used fritware to produce fine ceramics decorated in an astonishing range of styles.\n\nDuring this period, Kashan potters experimented with painting designs under the glaze. They used black, which remained stable during firing, under a clear or tinted glaze. Here, the potter has used it on the bowl's exterior and interior to create a design like flowing reeds.",
