The pelvis is more solid, and the buttocks are shaped. The hand and the forearm are all in one piece; the upper arm is slightly stuffed. \n\nTwo control bars;  bar 1 with two notches, with leg strings;  bar  2 with four notches plus a vestigial staple/wire hook in centre (possibly for suspension, or the remnants of a head wire, but no trace of head rod centre back).  Present stringing: head to ends of bar, also hands attached to same place.  Back string (between shoulders to allow for dramatic head movements and speech) attached to one of the inner notches - this cannot correspond to the original stringing.  Brass screw eye centre chest for run-through string to facilitate special gestures.",

Marionette shows were a popular form of entertainment for adults in the 19th century, many of them family concerns which travelled around the country long before the advent of film and television, presenting shortened versions of London's latest popular entertainment from melodramas and pantomimes to minstrel shows and music hall. In the 18th and early 19th centuries their theatres were relatively makeshift, but after about 1860 many became quite elaborate, with walls constructed from wooden shutters, seating made from tiered planks of wood, and canvas roofs.\n\nThe figures were carved, painted, dressed and performed by members of the company.  This is a middle-aged man with a carved moustache who would have been a stock character, used in any play requiring such a role. His right hand is carved closed to hold props, the left is open for gesture.",

They began working on recreating some of the puppets' original repertoire. Since the original cloths were too fragile for performance, new backdrops were painted, and in August 1951 as part of The Festival of Britain celebrations, the marionettes took to the stage again as The Old Time Marionettes, at the Riverside Theatre, Festival Gardens, Battersea Park. In the 1980s George Speaight lent the troupe to puppeteers  in Germany but in the late 1990s he sold them to John Phillips, an expert puppet carver, manipulator and puppet historian, whose widow sold them to the Museum after his death in 1998.",

            "production_note": "It is impossible to identify the precise maker of this marionette since the company made, altered and used figures throughout its career.  It is possible, however, to distinguish distinct types, and therefore groups, made by different makers, due to the type of carving.  The carver of this object has been distinguished as Maker A because of its small head.",
