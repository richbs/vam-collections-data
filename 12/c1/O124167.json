Christophe-Philippe Oberkampf's workshop pioneered the complicated process for printing cotton textiles with fast-coloured dyes in Europe.Many steps were involved in producing the finished textile. First the copper plates were engraved with the desired design using a burin, in the manner of plates for fine art prints. The plate would then be coated with a mordant, a solution that would react with the dye during the dyeing process, binding it to the cloth. The cloth would then be printed with the plates by hand before finally being immersed in vats of dye for the design to take. \n\nIn 1797, the copper-roller printing machine was introduced to Jouy, which sped up the printing process and greatly increased the workshop's output.",
