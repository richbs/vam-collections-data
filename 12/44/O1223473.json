He was the design director for the punk and New Wave label Stiff Records from shortly after its foundation in 1976 until his death. Bubbles was a key figure creating the close link between the music industry and innovative graphic design in Britain and his work was a catalyst for designers such as Peter Saville and Malcolm Garrett.\n\nThis poster is one of a series of five produced to promote a UK tour by artists on the Stiff label in 1977. Each poster shows a different musician: Ian Dury, Nick Lowe, Elvis Costello, Larry Wallis and Wreckless Eric. This was the tour which made Costello and Dury into household names. The musicians were photographed by Chris Gabrin, Stiff\u2019s regular publicity photographer, and Bubbles used different neon colours in simple cut-out shapes to create a graphic identity for the series of posters. They were intended for sale at concerts, as well as for promotional use, but sold poorly due to their extremely large size. This design is of particular interest since it shows Dury, one of the best-known performers on the tour and a close collaborator of Barney Bubbles on many of his most important designs.",
