This outfit was displayed in the V&A's Street Style exhibition of 1994-95 to represent Gay Style.\n\nAccording to Mr. Stubbings, gay men favoured Levis jeans for their cut and fit. The donor distressed these jeans with a pumice stone to emphasis the contours of the body beneath. The leather waistcoat was originally linked to the Fetish scene, but moved into mainstream dress. In the mid 1990s, when this outfit was acquired, some lesbians were also dressing in the same manner.\n\nPurchased. Registered File number 1994/1109.",
