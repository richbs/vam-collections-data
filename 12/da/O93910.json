            "physical_description": "Oak chest of panelled construction, with four parchmin panels on the front and at each end two vertical linenfold panels; with a domed lid of separate origin.\n\nThe framework is pegged tenon and mortice construction without any mitreing at the joints, and with a gentle chamfer along the lower edges below each panel. The front legs have been cut with a groove that runs right down the floor, missing from the rear legs. The front muntins have moulded edges, while the muntins on the ends and rear are all plain. The front parchmin panels are carved with (on the two central panels) undulating stems with trefoil and fleur-de-lis, and (the outer two panels) leafy stems with bunches of grapes. The end panels are simplified linenfold with a central teardrop at each end. Rear panels are plain, with chamfered edges around an unusually even but \u2018rough\u2019 surface, not obviously hand-sawn or planed, and possibly indicative of mechanical sawing with some hand-tidying. The interior is fitted at either end with a till with the front angled forward, missing its lid, with corresponding wear on the chest lid. The gently domed lid is formed by three oak planks pegged (square or rectangular pegs) into shaped cleats under either end, but does not overhang the front of the chest as one would expect. It is held by nails on two old butterfly hinges, with two (apparently earlier) wing hinges still in situ, and fitted with a long hasp inside the lid, which fits an ironwork lock (c1500 in style, with cut trefoil corners) nailed onto the chest front. Where the hasp crosses the front rail a shallow rebate has been cut out of the rail. The base of the chest consists of front to back oak boards very neatly and tightly fitting together in a bird\u2019s mouth joint, and supported by a central batten dovetailed and nailed up into the front and rear rails.\n \nCondition\nIn general the joints are tight, and most of the pegs are slightly oval in shape. Most of the framework is in unusually good condition without obvious wear, worm or damp-deterioration. There is some evidence of shrinkage across the front panels. Both rear feet have been tipped and the underside of the front and PR end rail show a good deal of abrasion and damp-deterioration. The two inner tills have lost their lids. The lid (though old and with two generations of old iron hinges) does not appear to be original to the chest, in which case neither is the (apparently old) ironwork lock and hasp. The muntin at either end of the chest has a central hole (one with metal staining) as if a metal pull had once been fitted. There is an isolated hole in one linenfold panel at the right end. The very substantial frame timbers may be a legitimate feature of 16th century Netherlandish construction, but seem over-substantial by comparison with other, more plausible chests.",

However, apart from the lid which seems to be old and reused, the unusually fresh condition of most of the woodwork, irregular wear and the very neat finish of all the surfaces (both show and hidden) make the authenticity of this object questionable. In addition, the combination of parchmin panels (which probably predate 1540), linenfold panels which may be dated to the second half of the 16th century and moulded muntins usually found on late 16th or 17th panelling suggest that this chest is of 19th or early 20th century construction using old panels, and an old lid from another chest, presumably with the intention of passing as an original 16th century object.\n\nSee also Burrell Collection, Glasgow 14/343\n\nNote from RPMA/1/C1757\nCompares with Macquoid, Age of Oak, fig.10\n'Mr Cleminson, who offers it because he is now moving house and has no room for it in his new house, bought it some years ago from Lee of Kingston for \u00a360.'
