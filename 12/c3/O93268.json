Engraved designs for silver flowed off their printing presses into workshops across Europe. Their goldsmiths and merchants travelled widely, the former sometimes settling in cities that promised new sources of patronage, the latter selling silver goods as far north as the Baltic Sea and as far east as Russia. \n\nAugsburg was well-placed to develop as a centre of silver production. It enjoyed a high degree of religious freedom and offered opportunities for patronage from both Catholic and Protestant churches. It was also the headquarters of the Fugger bank, one of the most powerful financial houses in Europe. Branch offices all over the Continent acted as agents for Augsburg goldsmiths and helped to secure supplies of bullion.",
