He initially trained as an architect but from 1883 he increasingly designed for the crafts. \n\nBindesb\u00f8ll was a master of the Art Nouveau style and enjoyed a local and international reputation as one of its most brilliant practitioners. His silverware received international acclaim at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1900, which acted as a showcase for the new style. You can see its influence here in the undulating rim and the organic shapes of the embossed decoration that stands proud of the surface.\n\nThe firm of A. Michelsen, which made the bowl, was founded in Copenhagen in 1841 and continues to this day. It contributed significantly to the major international exhibitions during the period 1850-1900.",
