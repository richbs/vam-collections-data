The region\u2019s natural gold resources had made the Asante wealthy and court regalia, which included textiles (kente), ivory and gold, reflected high levels of skill and technology. \n\nGold rings made using the \u2018lost wax\u2019 method of casting were worn for personal adornment and to indicate wealth and status. Some were worn by chiefs, others adorned the fingers, thumbs and toes of wealthy men and women. Smaller gold and silver rings were also made to decorate the long bamboo stems of chiefs\u2019 tobacco pipes.\n\nThe rough casting of this ring suggests it was worn by an affluent individual rather than a member of the court. Its design of three oval plaques echoes European forms of jewellery, particularly the signet ring. In fact Asante goldsmiths, especially those based in workshops along the coast, saw the jewellery worn by Europeans stationed there and this had a marked influence on the development of Asante jewellery design.",
