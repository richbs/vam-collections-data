            "public_access_description": "The drawing shows two facades: the fa\u00e7ade of the church and the fa\u00e7ade of the School. Their structures are quite similar and have two levels. The first level of the School has a main arched door surmounted by a pediment with a bow-window on each side. The second level has only two bow-windows. A large pediment with a circular window in the middle completes the fa\u00e7ade. The first level of the Church has a main arched door surmounted by a cornice and flaked by two bow-windows surmounted by a pediment. The second level has two narrow bow-windows with a large circular one in the middle. A large pediment with a cartouche completes the fa\u00e7ade on top. A cross-section of the fa\u00e7ade under each one shows the decoration relief. \n\nThe church and its convent were founded in 1483 by Maria Caroldo and rebuilt in 1506 after a design by Lo Scarpagnino (Antonio Abbondi 1465/70-1549). In 1520 the apse was demolished and the present Lombardesque fa\u00e7ade built but finished in1524 by Giacomo de Bernardis, under Scarpagnino's supervision. The back of the fa\u00e7ade is taken up with a funerary monument to Paolo Paruta, an historian of the Venetian Republic, said to be by Baldassare Longhena (1596-1682) and built around 1651.\n\nAntonio Visentini (Venice, 21 Nov 1688 - Venice, 26 June 1782) was an Italian painter, engraver, architect and theorist. He was first known as a painter and trained with the Venetian history painter Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini (1675-1741). He became known as an engraver by the end of the 1720s when he was commissioned by Joseph Smith to produce engravings of Canaletto's views of Venice. Visentini started working as an architect in 1731, and his first theoretical work, Libro di Architettura, which included Rococo-influenced drawings by Pier Antonio Morelli after Visentini's ideas, was published in 1733. \n\nHis ideas on contemporary architecture derived from Antiquity and the work of Andrea Palladio (1508-80). Later however, Visentini developed neo-Palladian and anti-Baroque ideas. Visentini and his pupils executed numerous drawings of ancient and contemporary buildings intended to disseminate exemplary architecture. He participated to the foundation of the Venetian Academy in 1755, where he became a teacher of architectural perspective in 1772.",
