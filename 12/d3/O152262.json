The remaining ground is densely packed with floral motifs in metal thread with blue details in two variations, one having a definite horizontal bar and the other having a more open bar form in red.\nThe heavily sized reverse has clear diagonal lines created by pressing hot metal rods onto the fabric.  Because these are not clearly visible on the front it is possible that they indicate the bias along which the fabric should be cut to use as a facing fabric for other items.\nSelvedge: 2 purple silk cords",
