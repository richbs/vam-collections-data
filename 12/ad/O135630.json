The lower ring is considerably wider than the upper and has a screw and spring mechanism which allows the height of the screen to be adjusted; the upper ring serves merely to hold the screen in a vertical position.  The screen is oval with scalloped edges, and is decorated with a border of gilt rocaille and flowers picked out with touches of yellow, red and whitish paint.  This border encloses a naturalistic bunch of flowers painted in bright colours.  The back of the screen is stamped 'Jennens & Bettridge' and is also signed with the initials 'SR' at the top in white.\n[Pole screen] Turned finial at top of pole in shape of vase.\n[Pole screen] Turned finial at top of pole in shape of squashed vase.",

It became popular in Britain during the 18th century when the term was first coined in English (whereas in French the term was not recognized until the 20th century). At first it was used in architectural mouldings and frames but as the technology improved it became a popular material for all sorts of decorative objects ranging from household furnishings to carriages.  Not prone to warping like wood or metal it was ideally suited to japanned decoration.  This in turn provided an ideal smooth surface for painted decoration. \n \nThis pair of pole screens was made by the celebrated firm of Jennens & Bettridge (1816-1864) at a time when the fashion for papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 japanned ware was at its height.  The backs of these screens are stamped with the company\u2019s name as well as the painted initials SR.  These are probably the initials of the person who painted the floral and scrolling decoration on the screens.  We do not know whether SR was employed by Jennens and Bettridge or if the work had been subcontracted out to an external workshop.   However, we do know that the firm took pride in producing items of the highest quality, and at the pinnacle of their success they employed over sixty decorators.",
