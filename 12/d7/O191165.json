            "public_access_description": "The poster depicts three generations of Poles, two of which were considered \u2018lost generations\u2019, scarred by history. The elderly man symbolizes the 2nd World War generation and the middle-aged man belongs to the communist period. The boy symbolizes the first generation of Poles to have a chance to grow up in a democratic country. The new generation was to embody and realize dreams and aspirations of the two preceding generations and therefore carried a great deal of expectation and hope. This is shown by the gaze of two adults turned to the boy and the slogan declaring that he will succeed where his father and grandfather have failed. The slogan \u2018You Shall Succeed\u2019 is depicted using the \u2018Solidarics\u2019 typeface based on the Solidarity logo designed by Jerzy Janiszewski in 1980. This use of lettering reveals the power of the Solidarity logo and its grounded position in people\u2019s minds.\n\nSolidarity, founded in September 1980, was the first free trade union in an Eastern Bloc country. It became the leading political force opposing the communist regime in Poland. Eventually the Polish Government was forced to negotiate with the Solidarity-led opposition, resulting in semi-free elections on 4th June 1989. This marked a crucial stage in the democratic transformation of Central and Eastern Europe.",
