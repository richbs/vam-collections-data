He carries a chopper and skull-cup; his second pair of hands holds a skull-topped trident formed like the Buddhist\nvajra and noose. His hair rises horrifically above a snake, and his armlets, bracelets, anklets and sacred cord are all snakes.  He is wearing heavy circular earrings and a circlet on his head with side cockades and uplifted streamers. He also has a necklace and a girdle below his waist over which spills his protruding paunch. His eyes stare fiercely with a third eye in between. He has a curling moustache over his open mouth which is fanged, and a garland of severed heads hangs down to his knees.",

He represents a violent and vengeful aspect of the Hindu god Shiva absorbed by Buddhism as a guardian of the faith (\u2018dharmapala\u2019). \n\nHere Mahakala stands astride the prostrate figure of a corpse. His face radiates his wrathful nature. His wide eyes glare, his gaping mouth reveals fangs, and a garland of severed heads hangs above his knees. His hair is represented as flames, rising horrifically above a snake ornament. Entwined snakes also form his armlets, bracelets, anklets and sacred cord. In his four hands he carries the flesh-cutter (\u2018karttrka\u2019), skull-cup (\u2018kapala\u2019), rosary and \u2018trisula\u2019 and skull-headed ritual staff (\u2018khatvanga\u2019). These are the signifiers of his role.\n\nTantric Buddhism generated a proliferation of deities, benign and ferocious. Both were conceived as servants of the faith. But it was the wild and angry deities, typically demonic spirits subdued by Buddhism and henceforth willing servants of the faith, who retained their wrathful countenance in order to intimidate non-believers and those hostile to Buddhism.",

Often, as in this case, their fierceness was directed not at the worshipper but at the enemies of Buddhism. Eventually other forms of Mahakala grew up but this one, in very similar form, became the most popular outside India particularly in Tibet and Nepal.\n\nSee Lowry [1976] pl.15.",
