The lines on the plate are filled with ink which is then printed onto paper. This etching is also an ornament print, for the printmaker intended it to be useful as a pattern for other craftsmen and women.\n\nTime\nThis is one of the earliest Rococo ornament prints published in England. The asymmetry of the shield and made up of elements in the shape of the letter C and S, and fluted edges suggestive of rocks, trailing flowers and scrolling foliage, are all typical of English Rococo. \n\nMaterials & Making\nThis is the sixth plate in a set of six shields. In style all the plates resemble Matthias Lock's own trade card which he himself etched in 1746. He also etched this print himself and signed it 'M. Lock fec'. The letters 'fec' are an abbreviation for the Latin fecit meaning 'made[it]'. Later in his career Lock employed a professional engraver to produce some of his sets of ornament prints.\n\nTrading\nFollowing Lock's death in 1765, the London print publisher Robert Sayer acquired most of Lock's copper plates and began republishing them. Sayer republished A Book of Shields on 3 February 1768, charging one shilling for the set.  There was still a demand for these plates more than twenty years after the plates were etched.",

First published Paris, 1801. Later editions 1812, 1827 and 1843.\n\nEtching and engraving. Size of volume 45 x 32 cm\n29564.10; 29564.16\n\nPercier and Fontaine stated in the introduction that their aim was not to provide the public with  models to imitate: 'Our ambition would be satisfied if we could flatter ourselves to have collaborated to spread and to uphold in a matter as variable, as swayed by changes of opinion and of whim, the principles of taste that we have drawn from antiquity, and which we believe linked, although by a scarcely visible chain, to general rules of truth, simplicity and beauty...'.\n\nOne of these rules concerned the suitability of a piece of furniture for its use: 'Among all the forms of a chair, there are some which are dictated by the shape of our body, by the demands of necessity or of comfort ... What is there that art could add? It should purify the forms dictated by convenience and combine them with the simplest outlines, giving rise from those natural conditions to ornamental motifs which would be adapted to the basic form without ever disguising nature'. They went on to say how often they have seen ornament applied to different parts of furniture so that it took the place of the part itself. But the furniture they drew is to our present view so encrusted with ornament and its forms so twisted by fashionable configurations that it belies their fastidious strictures. Concepts of purified form, simple outline and the adaptation of ornament to use have substantially changed in the intervening 170 years or so since the book was published.\n\nSL'",
