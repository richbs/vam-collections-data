            "public_access_description": "Grenadian born photographer Raphael Albert (1935-2009) was committed to celebrating the growing black population in Britain. Whilst living in Hammersmith, West London he began to organise and photograph a host of black beauty pageants from the 1960s to the 1980s, mostly targeted at women from the British Caribbean community. \n\nWomen were extravagantly styled for these events, adopting the hairstyle and adornment trends of the period. Local beauty salons with expertise in black hairstyling were often used by pageants preparing to compete. This salon also features a narrative of academic achievement in the range of graduation photographs on display. \n\nThe V&amp;A acquired seven of Albert\u2019s photographs documenting beauty pageants and the British Caribbean community in London as part of the Staying Power project. Staying Power is a five year partnership between the V&amp;A and Black Cultural Archives. The project aims to explore black British experience from the 1950s to the 1990s through photographs acquired by the V&amp;A and oral histories conducted by Black Cultural Archives.",
