Several potteries marketed it under a different name but Parian ware became its generic name after Minton used 'Parian' to suggest Paros, the Greek island which supplied a lot stone used for Classical statuary.  Parian ware was not cheap but gave households the semblance of owning a marble bust or figurine, previously only afforded by the very wealthy.  The Worcester firm started their production of Parian relatively late, but after they launched a range at the Dublin Exhibition in 1853, James Hadley (1837-1903), their chief modeller, created a large number of decorative and useful wares for them, including the Shakespeare subjects Lady Macbeth and King Lear, while another modeller William Boynton Kirk produced a dozen figure groups based on characters from A Midsummer Night's Dream.  \n\nThis is probably a Worcester piece and may well have been modelled by James Hadley.  It shows the scene from The Merry Wives of Windsor when Mistresses Page and Ford humiliate Falstaff in retaliation for his amorous advances by hiding him in a laundry basket which Mrs. Ford's servants leave in the river.",
