The doll has a socket head with moulded and painted features; sleeping blue glass eyes; and an open red-painted mouth with five upper teeth. The head is hollow with a cork pate to which the short, fringed, chestnut-coloured woollen wig is attached.  The child body and the forearms with hands are made of composition, and the legs and upper arms are of wood.  The arms are jointed at the shoulders and elbows and the legs at the thigh and knee, although the kneecaps are depicted on the lower legs, below the knee joint.\n\nThe doll is wearing a piece of cream coloured cotton, edged with machine made filet lace, wrapped around her as a petticoat and secured at the neck back with a safety pin and at the waist with a ring of elastic.  Her much shorter dress is of unlined scarlet tarlatan, and has a bodice cut with a round neck and vestigial sleeves, with a lightly gathered skirt attached at the waist; an apron of multi-coloured striped cotton is stitched to it at the shoulders and waist.  The high crowned hat with a narrow circular brim is made of card painted black with Indian ink.\n\n(original 1980 register entry) \nDoll, bisque socket head with a jointed composition body, blue glass sleeping eyes and wool hair.  The doll is wearing a Welsh national costume.  The costume consists of a white knee length linen petticoat with crocheted hem, a crimson overdress and a striped multi-coloured cotoon pinafore.  On her head is a black cardboard Welsh hat, broken, with white lace fringe.",
