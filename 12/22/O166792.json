The front of the casement is depicted as a panelled frame, with two circular studs (for pastes or metal discs) on each of the sides, a single stud in the centre at the top and two square studs at the upper corners. A stud for a jewel also appears on the Virgin's cloak below the throat. The Virgin is shown seated in three-quarter length on a throne or chair, one arm of which is visible on the left. Behind is a flaming candlestick. A second candlestick appears on the right between the heads of the Virgin and Child. The Virgin's head is inclined to the left, and she looks down at the open book resting on the parapet, on which she places her right hand. With her left hand she supports the Child, who stands on two cushions on the parapet. He clasps the Virgin's index finger with his left hand; his right arm is extended against her breast.",
