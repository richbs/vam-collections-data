There is a narrow dark line along the top.  There is a white ground band above and below the lower border; this continues part of the way up each side and has small outward pointing 'arches' in green or pink, both outlined in red, resting on a light green 'bowl'. The border contains an angled striped stem with a red blossom pointing to the lower right alternating with a stem of 3 white flowers pointing to the upper right.\n\nThe main pattern is a series of diagonal lines from lower right to upper left.  These are separated by chevron lines of green and light green.  \n\nThere are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: angled light green stem with 4-petalled white flower surrounded by 6 small white flowers, all outlined in orange and pointing to the bottom alternating with a straight stem from a triangular base with 3 red flowers pointing down and, to the right of this, a red  blossom in profile pointing to the lower right.\n[2] wider stripes in two designs: [a] white ground with 2 large diamond arrangements: at the top of one is a stem pointing to the lower right with 5 flowers [irises?] veined in red, below this is a straight stem pointing down with 2 orange and red flowers, the lower one is edged with green leaves.  To the left of this stem is a black-outlined bird above a spray of mauve flowers; in the alternate arrangement the mauve flowers are at the top and the red veined ones are at the bottom. There is one central pink and red flower in profile pointing to the lower left. There is a blue flower to the right of this above another bird. [b] Green ground with two diamond arrangements: black outlined vase, 2 black edged flowers either side, a central red flower with a bird and 2 white and 3 red flowers to complete the diamond alternating with an angled striped stem with 2 red leaves at the base, a small black edged flower encircled by white ones, a blue flower either side, 2 red ones and a blue one at the lowest point of the diamond shape.",
