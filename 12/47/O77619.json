The style of flower painting, the turquoise blue and the gilding all imitate French porcelain.The vase could have been used to contain rose petals or pot pourri: the pierced leaf-shapes below the vase rim would have allowed the scent to circulate.\n\nSocial Class\nAlthough clearly of superb quality, both in the brilliantly white bone china and the fine painting, this vase and cover were less expensive to buy than the 18th-century French S\u00e8vres porcelain they copy. With this classical ovoid form and pretty decoration, Minton's were meeting the ambitions of the newly wealthy for the genuinely 'old French' furnishings of the rich.\n\nTime\nMinton's production of ornamental porcelain increased greatly as the influence of Herbert Minton became more apparent.  He became director in 1834, and by 1840 some 255 different designs were in production; by 1900 the number had risen to 3,500.  It was a considerable commercial investment and the factory naturally borrowed ideas from a wide variety of sources. Despite other fashionable trends, French 18th-century porcelain remained popular throughout the 19th century.",
