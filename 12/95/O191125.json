It is a typical example of the Alliance of Young Democrats\u2019 campaign which was characterised by spontaneity and informality. The party\u2019s electoral offices worked independently and posters were usually designed not by professional artists, but by the young political activists themselves.\n\nThis design consciously avoids the symmetry, stiff decorative quality and use of national colours prevalent in the graphic materials of the other political parties. Through gestural yellow brush strokes the designer evokes the freedom of graffiti or modern painting. It was by these means that viewers could immediately identify a \u2018FIDESZ\u2019 poster. \u2018FIDESZ\u2019 was the abbreviation of the party name - Fiatal Democrat\u00e1k Sz\u00f6vets\u00e9ge.",
