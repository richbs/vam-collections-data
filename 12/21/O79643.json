In the Syrian region, which incorporated much of Palestine, Jordan and Lebanon as well as Syria itself in the 19th century, they were worn by all sections of society, from townswomen to the nomadic Bedouin of the desert.  The designs vary by sector and show influences from a wide area, reflecting Syria\u2019s strong trading traditions and central location.\n\nHeavy penannular bracelets, like these, were usually worn by the Bedouin.  The five studs are typical of the traditional Bedouin jewellery of Syria.  These were bought for four shillings and sixpence (the pair) at the International Exhibition, London, in 1872.  Their name was recorded as \u2018ussuar\u2019, which is a generic Arabic name for bracelets in the region.",
