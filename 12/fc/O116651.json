Filigree was used for all kinds of objects, including hair pins, chains and various kinds of bodice fastener.\n\nThis boss, with its matching pair, was originally part of a hair ornament.  The two bosses were fastened at either end of a curved strip of wire, like an Alice band, which was worn over the head, with the decorative bosses above the ears, to keep a small lace cap firmly in place. These hair bands were mainly worn in the canton of Graub\u00fcnden, in the east of Switzerland \u2013 this one was described as having come from Engadin when it was acquired by the Museum in 1870.",
