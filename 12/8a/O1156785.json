It stars 'the famous Welsh Compere Ben Jenkins' with an assortment of his 'discoveries' followed by acts including Maurice 'the world's youngest impressionist', Johnny Martin 'the new lad from Liverpool', Cave & Morgan 'the Singing Dresdens' and  the hand-balancing acrobats and contortionists the Three Royces. It also features the double act Arthur Astill and Gwen Fontaine, billed as 'Mirth, Mimicry and Ventriloquism'. One of their acts, which they may have performed at Worcester, was entitled 'Impressions of Country Life' and included mimicry of birds, animals and children. \n\nThis hanging card was part of a collection made by Arthur Astill (1887-1962) of advertisements from theatres where he and his wife Gwen Fontaine appeared. It is typical of the format of two-colour printing used in the 1940s to advertise Variety, with the names of the most popular stars literally appearing at the 'top of the bill'. The names of Astill and Fontaine are at the bottom of this bill. A pencilled note on the back lists what time the act came on each evening, and its duration.",
