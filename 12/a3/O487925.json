This indicates that the much deteriorated screen owned by Kenneth Clark, whereabouts currently uncertain, and the V&amp;A's screen formed a pair.\n\nTls Peter Sparks to Kenneth Clark, 18th June 1949, TGA 8812.1.2.6121\n'Dear Sir Kenneth,\nYour letter gave me so much pleasure this morning, as I feel so happy that you have the screen.\nYou might be interested to know that Sir Leigh Ashton has bought the other one for the Victoria and Albert Museum.\nForgive a very short note, as I am dictating this letter between times at the Fair, and you know what a rush it is on my Stand at times, and I may not be able to sign the letter myself. If this should be so, forgive me.\nI am really delighted to have found something for you and Lady Clark, as clients of such long standing mean much to me.\nYours sincerely\npp Peter Sparks'",
