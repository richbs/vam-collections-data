The ingenuity of the contraption recalls the inventions of Victorian entrepreneurs, the under-pull, on a counter-spring, is a small moulded fish. The fish-tail handle is swallowed by the mouth of the blade, a fish-head, resolving the difficult transition with humour. The upper blade is a forged oxidised net, giving a visual texture and depth and enhancing the humorous motif of a caught fish. The piece combines craftsmanship and style with a humorous twist in a unique and individual piece.",
