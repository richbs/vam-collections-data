            "bibliography": "Ward-Jackson, Peter, Italian Drawings Volume I. 14th-16th century, London, 1979, p. 209. The text is as follows: Cartouche, surmounted by a Doge's cap and decorated with allegorical figures, masks, grotesques etc Pen and ink and wash 15 \u00bd x I0 \u00bc (394 x 260) 2301 PROVENANCE Sir T. Lawrence (Lugt 2445); S. Woodburn (sale, Christie, 4-8 June 1860, unidentified lot; bought for the Museum) This drawing and no. 453, both manifesi by the same hand, both sharing the sarru provenance and both showing the same : of cartouche, were unaccountably separa and assigned to different artists when acquired by the Museum. No. 452 was ascribed to Perino del Vaga, in accordar with the inscription, an attribution that might be justified on the ground that th grotesque decorations are in his taste all reminiscent of his style; while the other drawing was given to Girolamo da Carpi. These attributions were abandoned some years ago and both drawings were tentatively ascribed to Battista Franco. This attribution in its turn has begun to wear thin and can no longer be maintained with any confidence. The artist was obviously gifted as an ornamentalist and had a clear notion of the type of stucco band work decoration that Rosso Fiorentino had developed at Fontainebleau in the 1530s. The bandwork frame in no. 452 is bent into an arc and pierced and cut exactly like the plasterwork frames there. This type of ornament was better understood and more often used north of the Alps than in Italy. It is possible therefore that our artist was an Italianising Northerner, one who had studied the ornamental repertory of Fontainebleau and who tried, not without success, to imitate the mannered grace and elegance of Primaticcio and Niccolo dell' Abbate. But this is only a conjecture. It is more probable that the drawings are Florentine after all, made by an artist who knew the work of Perino and Salviati and had acquired a knowledge of the ornament of Fontainebleau from engravings.",
