            "history_note": "The artist of these caricatures, Gilbert Sommerlad, was by profession a musician who was born into a family that had a long tradition of professional musicians.  His grandfather, his father, his uncles, and his two brothers, as well as other members of the family all played several orchestral instruments but he seems to have been the first to study the piano.  His second instrument was the violin.  His father, Charles, was well known in Brighton as a violinist who for some time worked in the Theatre Royal Orchestra.  Gilbert worked in cinemas as a solo accompanist and he later worked at the Theatre Royal, Brighton and at the Palace Pier Theatre where he began to draw caricatures of the performers.  In 1936 he moved to the recently built New Theatre, Oxford, to join his brother Roy (violin and clarinet) as resident pianist.  He continued with his caricatured until his retirement, although his career was interrupted by the War and by a spell in the resident trio in the Cadena Caf\u00e9.\n\nGilbert was an exceptionally good and popular rehearsal pianist, and visiting companies and individual performers used to make sure that he would be available.  He became well-known in the profession and his ability as a caricaturist became common knowledge.  This volume contains sketches mostly of musical directors and conductors working at the Oxford New Theatre with Gilbert Sommerlad.",
