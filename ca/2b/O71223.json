It was made at a time when vases were enormously popular. Wedgwood exploited and promoted this fashion, boasting of his intention of becoming 'Vase Maker General to the Universe' in 1769. For Wedgwood, the vase form itself had elevated associations. In 1771 he said: 'it is the forms more than the colours of many of the Vases which has raised, & unvulgariz'd them - Make exactly the same pebbles [pottery with mottled glazes like this one] into Tea ware & they are let down to the class of common Pott ware again, many degrees below Queens Ware'.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe glaze imitates the surface of porphyry or another similar hardstone. In 1770 Wedgwood wrote of his intention to imitate ancient porphyry vases. He asked his business partner to borrow one owned by Lord Besborough so that he could cast a mould from it.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe vase is made from a type of pottery that has recently been identified as the one Wedgwood marketed as 'white terracotta stoneware.'",
