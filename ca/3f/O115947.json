The napkins are of a high quality/grade of linen damask and compare very favourably with other linens in this collection.  It is possible that the design is by Christopher Dresser, the leading commercial designer of his day, for it is known that Dresser supplied designs both to Irish damask manufacturers and also directly to London shops who then had the linens made up specifically for their own label.\n\nLittle is known about the supply of retail textile goods in London during the late 19th century so this, known to have come from the Fore Street Warehouse Company in London, potentially provides important information on middlemen or warehousemen active in the furnishing and nappery (table linens) trade. \n\nJohn Pollock, the donor's grandfather, worked at the Fore Street Warehouse Company Ltd from 1875. He eventually became a director. The company is listed in the 1866 Post Office Directory as trading at 104-107 Fore Street, London.",
