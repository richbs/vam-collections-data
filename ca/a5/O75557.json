It was not the closed piece of furniture for storage that we think of today. In the first half of the 1600s, the form was known in England as a court cupboard, although we do not know why. They were often placed in the hall or dining parlour. The owner's silver cups would be arranged on the shelves and set off by decorative cloths to make an impressive show. The pieces were also placed in bedrooms, where they provided shelf space for other domestic equipment. \n\nCourt cupboards were often carved or inlaid, as on this example. The decoration usually borrows from classical and late Renaissance ornament. This court cupboard incorporates some elements dating from about 1600, combined with other parts made in the early 1900s. We do not know exactly what was done to it. The modern work may have consisted of extensive repairs to an earlier cupboard, or perhaps the 'restorer' created a deliberate fake using some old elements.\n\nOn loan to Woolsthorpe Manor (National Trust).",

The owner, Martin Tomson, has no particular knowledge of old furniture and has written to the museum to offer it for purchase.\n\n7/10/20 Brackett to the Director\n\"this Jacobean sideboard\u2026is one of the few types of furniture of its period of which we do not possess a proper example.  They are very rare.\"\n\n22/10/20 Tomson\noffers the \"old Jacobean dinner wagon that has been slightly repaired\" for \u00a3300.  He believes he bought it at W Bretts sale at St Peters about 20 years earlier.  Brett was a collector and newspaper proprietor.\n\n26/10/20 H Clifford Smith report following visit to Ramsgate\nthe piece was \"finer than I imagined\u2026of the highest quality.  It proved to be not of oak, but of walnut - a wood rarely used for furniture at that date\u2026I am disposed to place it in the Elizabethan period\u2026.Since it has been in the present owners' hands, the sideboard has undergone certain repairs\u2026the renewal of parts of the shelves which had become worm eaten\u2026repairs\u2026do not detract from its value\".\n\n4/11/20 Transit Room records\nthe receipt of the side board and lists its condition as \"worm-eaten; chipped; restored.  Pieces missing, including pieces of capitals and bases of upper columns, bottom left corner pieces of inlay.  No key\".\n\n12/11/20 Brackett\nrecommends purchasing the Elizabethan sideboard.  \"It is an object of distinguished appearance and good proportion possessing an unspoiled surface and showing the finest quality in carving and inlay\u2026defects are negligible.  There is no question that the sideboard is thoroughly genuine\u2026it would prove a most important acquisition\u2026a rare and important piece for the moderate sum of \u00a3300\".  \nHe continues \"the sideboard is so obviously genuine, important and desirable from every point of view\".\n\n19/11/20 Clifford Smith \nconcurs \"Mr Brackett has not at all over-estimated its importance: apart from its great rarity, it is just the kind of capital piece by which English woodwork should be represented in this museum\".\n\nObject sampling carried out by Jo Darrah, V&A Science; drawer/slide reference 1/19.",
