Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nRoy Barbour presented a concert-party style entertainment at the Blackpool Pier Theatre after the war, and his connections with Blackpool made him an ideal actor to star in Zip Goes a Million by Eric Maschwitz.  He played Percy Piggott, the role originally played by George Formby when the musical comedy, based on the farce Brewster's Millions, was originally presented at the Palace Theatre London in 1951.",
