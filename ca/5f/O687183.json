W. Fores Piccadilly.</i>\nEtching coloured by hand.\n35.5 X 51.5cm\nE.1001-1970\nBM S=British Museum <i>Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires</i>, London 1870-1954.\n\nRowlandson occupies an extraordinary position in the history of British Art as both an important watercolourist and a major supplier of satirical and topical subjects to print publishers in the decades around 1800.\nExamples exist of hand-coloured Rowlandson prints that bear great similarity to Rowlandson's watercolours suggesting that the artist coloured some prints himself either as a model for the professional colourist to copy when the print was first published, or else (in line with other techniques he employed such as counterproofing ink drawings) as a means of maximising his income.  This print is unfortunately not of that rare class although the colouring is probably eighteenth century and is very similar to that of the impression in the British Museum.  The drawing for this print is in a private collection.<sup>1</sup>  The ridges of the mould on which this laid paper was made are particularly noticeable in the wash covering the stage floor.  Wove paper which eliminated this intrusive grid in the paper was first used in England for Baskerville's <i>Virgil</i> in 1757 but was not much used for prints before the 1790s.  Laid paper also continued to be employed by the less particular print publishers for decades after that.\n\n1.  Great Britain, Arts Council <i>The Georgian Playhouse</i> 1975, no 266.\"",
