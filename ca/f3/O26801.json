For more than six players two packs should be used\n\nThe pack consists of 44 cards, illustrating from actual photographs, typical units representative of our magnificent British Fleet as follows:-\n3 cards Battleship               King George V\n3   \"             \"                     Queen Elizabeth\n2   \"             \"                     Renown\n2   \"             \"                     Nelson\n3 cards Cruiser                   Ajax\n3   \"          \"                        Exeter\n3   \"          \"                        Achilles\n3 cards Destroyer               Cossack\n3 cards Aircraft Carrier        Eagle\n3 cards Submarine             Triumph\n3 cards Seaplane              Sunderland\n3 cards Minelayer\n3 cards Minesweeper\n3 cards Sloop                     Deptford\n3 cards Patrol Ship             Kingfisher\n1 Master Card                     White Ensign\n\nThese cards are divided into four suits indicated by a Crown, Anchor, Lifebuoy and Pennant, and are numabered from one to eleven with the exception of the Crown suit which is numbered from one to ten.  The crown is always the Trump suir and if unable to follow suit any Crown card takes the trick unless overtrumped by another player who also unable to follow suit; or the play of the Master Card.  The Master, ensign, card is superior to all others in the pack and may be played at any time, in turn, even if able to follow the suit led.\nRULES OF PLAY\nDeal\nCut for deal.  Deal commences with the player ib dealer's left.  All cards are dealt out evenly and if there are any odd cards over these should be placed on one side, face down, and shuffled into the pack again before each new deal..\nPlay\nPlayer one dealer's left leads and the highest card played takes the trick.  Players must follow suit if able to do so but otherwise can discard any card, or may, at discretionm trump or play the Master card.  A loss of 10 points is the penalty for not following suit if able to do so.  The winner of each trick leads to the next and so on.\nScoring\nAt the end of each hand, each player scores points, as follows, according to the cards contained in the tricks he has personally taken.\nFor any set of 3 cards...10 points\nFor each additional card to  a set of three...5 points\nConsolation Score\nTo the player with the lowest total score after each round...5 points\nIf two or more tie with equally low scores...5 points each\n\nExplanatory notes on scoring\nFor any three ships of a type, e g 3 Battleships, 3 Destroyers, 10 points are scored for each set of three.  In the case of Battleships and Cruisers where there are 10 cards and 9 cards respectively in the pack, a set of three cards can be assorted over the various names of the ships - for instance, a set of three Cruisers can consist of 1 each Ajax, Achilles and Exeter, or 2 Ajax and 1 Exeter and so on.  Any player having more than three cards of either Battleships or Cruisers, scores an extra 5 points for each card over the three.\nIt is recommended that no player shall be allowed to examine tricks he has personally won once they are placed face down on the table.  In this way the game proves an excellent memory test.  It can be decided otherwise if an easier game is desired.\n\nMaster Card\nThe Master, Ensign, card may be used once in each round (by the holder) to complete a set of three cards with any other two cards which are alike.  If a Master card is used with a set of htree, e g 3 Destroyers, this would constitute a set of four cards for which the player would receive an extra 5 points.\n\nGame is won by the player first reaching a total score of 250 points.  For a short game a limit of 100 points could be fixed before play commences.\n\nNOTE\nIt will be seen that there is much room for skill in the playing of this game.  Instead of trying to take as many tricks as possible, players will concentrate on taking tricks containing cards helpful in completing sets.\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge the expert assistance given in the production of England Expects by Francis E McMurtrie, Editor of Jane's Fighting Ships.\n\nMade in England",
