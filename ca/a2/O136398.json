The most enduring method in Britain is done by hand, and is known as 'piecing over paper'. The pattern is first drawn onto paper and then accurately cut. Small pieces of fabric are tacked round each of the shapes, and then joined together from the back using overstitch. Geometric shapes produce some of the most striking examples. The work is often embellished with embroidery, as is the case here.\n\nThis small, unlined piece of patchwork may have been made to form part of a cushion cover or larger bedcover or screen. No information concerning its history was available when it was acquired in 1938, but the embroidery announcing the birth of a child, suggests that the panel was prepared to mark the birth or christening of the baby. Originally thought to represent the names of the parents (\u2018Henry\u2019 and\n\u2018Jane\u2019), it is now believed that the piece gives the full name of the child: Henry Iane Haines. \n\nOne of the borders is embroidered freehand with black wool in chain stitch, a technique whose popularity was stimulated by the import of Indian embroideries. Six different but fashionable cottons have been used, and the blue stripes in one selvedge indicate that the maker has used English cottons manufactured after 1776. Some patches have been created from tiny pieces, suggesting their limited availability to the members of this household.",
