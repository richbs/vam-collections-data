He took part in the third Anglo-Mysore war as a surveyor, making a series of drawings of Seringapatam, the capital of the Mysore ruler, Tipu Sultan, as well as Bangalore and the hill forts of Mysore at the same time as he surveyed the routes taken by the army of Lord Cornwallis in 1791 and 1792. His drawings were engraved by John William Edy, a Dane working in London, and his aquatints were published as Twelve views of places in the Kingdom of Mysore, the country of Tippoo Sultan, in London in 1794.
