Traditionally identified as cosmetics boxes for women's face make-up, these boxes could equally have been used to hold incense for Buddhist practice. \n\nWith its seven delicate chrysanthemum heads decorating the cover, this celadon box is a typical example of Koryo ceramic taste of the 12 or 13th centuries. The floral pattern was achieved by carving into the clay. White and dark infill materials were then applied before the vessel was glazed and fired.  Decoration at the perimeter of the box and cover consists of repeated incised linear patterns.",
