Even after the government had begun to lose control of events and the entire cabinet resigned, the SED remained in control. But toward the end of November a Round table including representatives of the new opposition groups as well as the coalition bloc parties was agreed, and on 1st December 1989 parliament approved the amendment of Article One of the Constitution, removing the SED's constitutionally  guaranteed leading role. On 20 February 1990 parliament approved a new electoral law guaranteeing free democratic elections. This cartoon attacks all the bloc parties of the communist regime, challenging the  fitness to govern of all those associated with the leading Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands. They were the Christliche Demokratische Union, the Liberale Demokratische Partei Deutschlands, the  Nationale Demokratische Partei Deutschlands and the Demokratische Bauern Partei Deutschlands.",
