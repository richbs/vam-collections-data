            "public_access_description": "This fine example of the carver's art is a mould for decorative relief, of the kind used to adorn panelling, ceilings, fireplaces and door surrounds.  The shallow carving indicates that this mould was for making a fairly flat band, probably to decorate a picture frame. Although the stylised leaves depicted here are reminiscent of the neo-classical motifs of the 18th century, it is more likely that this mould was carved during the 19th century when the neo-classical style was revived.  \n\nDifferent mixtures of whiting, glue and gum arabic, known as 'composition', were pressed into the boxwood mould to make crisp, detailed mouldings that were light and easy to apply to a ceiling or wall.  For larger mouldings paper pulp or some kind of textile were added to provide body. The development of moulded composition ornament brought about a decline in the number of professional woodcarvers needed for decorating interiors.  Skilled carvers, however, were still very much in demand for the production of perfect moulds. \n\nThis piece is part of a large collection of moulds and carvings once owned by George Jackson & Sons, a London firm specialising in decorative plasterwork.  Established in 1780, Jackson's were reputed to have produced neo-classical mouldings for interiors designed by the Adam brothers, such as those at Croome Court in Worcestershire.  Later Jackson projects included work on the Royal Pavilion at Brighton, Buckingham Palace and several Cunard liners.\n\nThis frieze depicts the stylised foliage of the Mediterranean species Acanthus spinosus, a tall plant commonly known as Bear's Breeches, with spiny leaves and a spike of purple and white flowers.",
