Many porcelains with either blank or minimally decorated surfaces were shipped to Europe for further patterning at specialist workshops. This highly-coloured enamelling in appropriately European taste added to their value. In many cases the so-called 'clobbered' designs were entirely European in character, but in this case the London enamellers chose to copy Chinese designs.\n\nTime\nThe clear-glazed porcelain body of this vase was made at kilns in Jingdezhen in Jiangxi Province in southern central China. The moulded flower patterns and minimal underglaze blue-painted design were part of the original manufacture of between 1740 and 1760. After being shipped to Europe, the vase was redecorated with coloured enamels in a London workshop, possibly that of James Giles (1718-1780), between 1752 and 1766.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe vase is made of very fine soft-paste porcelain that was the inspiration for European porcelain production.  Chinese soft-paste is not the same as European soft-paste. It has a higher than usual proportion of kaolin clay in the china clay / china stone body composition. It was used to produce fine, smooth wares, but was not suited to the manufacture of large vessels.",
