This photograph of the exhibition building shows the vast enclosure which is virtually empty except for an elm tree which was accommodated during the construction.\n\nMaterials & Making\nBenjamin Brecknell Turner (1815-1894) began practising photography in 1849 according to the technique patented in 1841 by the British inventor W. H. Fox Talbot (1800-1877). Turner's photographs were 'contact' printed from paper negatives (known as 'calotypes') of the same size, 27 by 39 centimetres. He printed them on 'albumen' paper made by suspending light sensitive silver salts in an emulsion of egg white.\n\nPlaces\nThe interior of the Crystal Palace is shown at Hyde Park in March 1852, shortly after the closure of the Great Exhibition and prior to the dismantling of the structure that year for its rebuilding at Sydenham in South London.\n\nOwnership & Use\nTurner compiled 60 photographs, including this one, in what is believed to be a unique album, 'Photographic Views from Nature'. It might have been made as a sample book, a convenient method of storing and presenting photographs for personal pleasure and showing to colleagues or potential exhibitors. It remained in the Turner family until 1982 when it was bought by the Museum.",
