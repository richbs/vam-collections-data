The 5th Duke was bearer of the Queen's crown at the coronation of of George III. It has been suggested that the cup was a Royal gift on this occasion, in which case it would have come from the workshop of Thomas Heming, the Royal Goldsmith. The trade-card of Heming, dating from about 1765, illustrates a very similar cup with a somewhat rococo base and term handles, the latter in turn being paralleled by the Heming cup of 1759 in the Museum (M.41-1959)",
