The moulded cast stem is soldered to the apex of this arch and curving upwards at right angles to the base.  It is surmounted by a ball terminal to which a falt \"U\" shaped bracket is attached, supporting the shade, by a threaded screw with a knurled knob on one side and a thumb screw directly opposite.  The shade is attached to this swivel bracket by two nuts and bolts.  The shade itself is a cone of sheet brass, with a rivetted seam.  The rim is a continuously alternating ogee shaped edge.  The apex of the cone has been cut into palmettes which are splayed outwards at 45 degrees to the surface of the shade.  Inside the apex is a circular disc, attached to the shade by screws, to a sleeve soldered to the underside and to which is soldered a bayonet fitting for the lamp.  This in turn is screwed to a knurled sleeve with a double thread, to which the swith mechanism is attached.  This is in the form of a flattened sphere.  A bakelite spindle passes through the centre operating the on/off mechanism.  One side of this mechanism unscrews to reveal the bakelite insulator and flex terminals.  At one end of the sphere, at right angles to the switch, is a small inverted cone with an external thread for the knurled sleeve in the apex of the shade, which houses another bakelite insulator (damaged) and the elctrical points for the lamp.  Directly opposite this is a small knurled screw trhough which the three core flex enters the switch housing.",

It has a distinctive open, vaned shade that Benson used on several lamp designs and also adapted for a firescreen (Museum no. M.37-1972).\n\nBenson was a great admirer of the designer and writer William Morris, who inspired him to set up a metalwork workshop in 1880. He later opened a well-equipped factory in Hammersmith, west London, and, in about 1887, a shop in Bond Street. The firm survived until he retired in 1920. \n\nBenson\u2019s firm produced some simple furniture but his great output was well-designed utilitarian metalwork, such as this lamp. He usually worked in copper and brass but sometimes in electroplate, producing lamps, teapots and food warmers.\n\nBenson had always been interested in engineering and, unlike so many of his contemporaries in the Arts and Crafts movement, had little compunction about the use of the machine.",
