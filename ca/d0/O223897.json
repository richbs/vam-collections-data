It is known that Carlin supplied such a table to the marchand-mercier Dominique Daguerre, as a Sevres mounted table bearing his trade label, was purchased by the Grand-Duchess Marie Feodorovna, together with a quantitiy of other furniture from Daguerre's premises in Paris which she visited in 1784. The lacquer panels on this table are much earlier in date and and have been cut down and made to fit, using lacquer cut from a different object. As lacquer was highly prized, and at this time furniture in Japanese lacquer was very fashionable, this practice was common among ebenistes in Paris, who were making furniture to order for the marchands-merciers.",
