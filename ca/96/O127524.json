Most of the items, including this one, came without any record of their previous history, but this piece was described as French in 1921 -- a view in line with current opinion -- so possibly Allom had acquired it in France. It must originally have formed part of an architectural setting, probably as part of a suite of room panelling. The mask appears to represent Apollo, the god of Music and Poetry, so it may have been used in a music room or a drawing room, devoted to the arts.",
