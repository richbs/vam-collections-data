Tin toys cover a vast array of subject matters ranging from the space age to domestic objects. This mechanical toy scene depicting an air terminal was made in Japan. It was not until the fifties that the Japanese firms begun to make their own original designs. They were mainly concerned with the American market meaning that their toys reflect American culture in some way. The idea of a plane circling an airport has been taken up by many manufacturers and different examples can be seen in Buhler's collection, including in the UK. \n\nThe Japanese tin toy production was at its peak in the 1960s.
