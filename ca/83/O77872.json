Minton's were one the largest and most forward-looking of Victorian ceramic manufacturers.  As with all factories, by far the largest proportion of their production was of tablewares such as these. It was this that financially supported art production which often was produced at a loss.\n\nTime\nMinton's had a well-established customer base on which they depended to regularly buy new tablewares. This smart design of 1875 incorporates a number of fashionable features which an 1870s art-conscious clientele would recognise. It was made in Minton's bone china and would have been more expensive  than earthenware production. It was therefore designed to appeal to middle and upper class diners. Minton's 'cloisonn\u00e9' wares attracted enthusiastic reviews at the Philadelphia Centennial of 1876.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe relatively high temperature which is required to fire bone china  also allows for crisp decoration, here skilfully applied by Minton's workforce. On this tableware fashionable Japanese and Chinese-style ornament is printed and painted in imitation of 'cloisonn\u00e9' metalwork. This ornament mimics both the technique of coloured enamel enclosed within brass-wire outlines and the vivid blue and other colours typical of the originals. Dresser has combined a repeating diaper pattern with his own stylised flower forms.",
