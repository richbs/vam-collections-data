This indicates that the designer is more interested in polemical or ironic statements than in creating a comfortable chair. The chair is a limited edition piece manufactured by the Swiss manufacturer Vitra as part of their art furniture line, Vitra Edition.",

ISBN 1851773088\nWhile the form and proportions of this self-consciously artistic armchair are based on the traditional club chair-an upholstered and overstuffed easy chair with deep arms and a low back-the bulkiness and solidity of the club chair are transformed into weightlessness and transparency through the use of an unexpected material. Comfort is obviously not a priority in the design. Rather, its apparent contradiction between form and function invites reflection, and its distinctively aesthetic presence asserts its intention to be viewed as a work of art as much as a piece of furniture.\n\nSORREL HERSHBERG",
