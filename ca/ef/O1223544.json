He acted at the Lyceum in his youth, using the name Bernard Gould, and made many drawings of Irving, some which appeared in the theatre's souvenir programmes. His work has provided both a record of costumes and scenery and of the dramatic effect of Irving's performances.\n\nThis image shows the actor Henry Irving (1838-1905) as Napoleon in 'Madame Sans-Gene'. The play was adapted by J Comyns Carr (from the French play of the same name by Victorien Sardou & Eduard Moreau) and first produced at the Lyceum Theatre, London on the 10th April 1897.",
