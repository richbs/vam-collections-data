Liart, Matthew (c.1736\u2013c.1782). <u>In: Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</u>. Oxford University Press, 2004. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/16635, accessed 1 Feb 2010]\nLiart, Matthew (c.1736\u2013c.1782), engraver, was probably of French Huguenot descent. J. T. Smith held that he was the grandson of a peruke maker and barber and the son of a sausage maker. His birthplace, Hog Lane, Soho, London, and his parents, Matthew or Matthieu Liart (d. 1750), a peruke maker, and El\u00e9onore Grignon, may possibly be identified from Huguenot records. He lived in Compton Street, Soho, where his father seems to have owned two houses, and was apprenticed to Simon Francis Ravenet the elder; he won a premium from the Society of Arts in 1764. According to Samuel Redgrave, he was also a student in the schools of the Society of Artists and the Royal Academy. He was awarded a silver medal for life drawing by the latter, and Smith reported Benjamin West's high opinion of his abilities in the drawing of the human figure.\n\nLiart exhibited a proof of The Convention between Jacob and Laban, after Pietro da Cortona, and The Sacrifice of Noah, after Andrea Sacchi, at the Society of Artists in 1766 and 1767 respectively, and appears to have specialized in fine engravings after old masters; both prints were executed for the series of famous paintings in English collections published by John Boydell. For that series Liart also engraved a large tavern scene, The Merry Companions, after Adriaen van Ostade, then in the collection of Joshua Reynolds (1783). Redgrave, among others, particularly emphasized the quality of Liart's two engravings after his contemporary Benjamin West\u2014Venus Lamenting the Death of Adonis and Cephalus and Procris\u2014which the engraver published himself. Nineteenth-century critical opinion was unanimous in its praise for the elegance, neatness, and decorum of Liart's style of engraving. On a more modest level, Liart contributed five single figures in national dress to the publication by the painter Francesco Smith, Eastern Costume (1769), a set of twenty-six prints after Smith's paintings in Lord Baltimore's collection. For John Bell's Edition of Shakespeare's Plays: as they are Now Performed at the Theatres Royal of London (1774), Liart engraved five of the small-scale scenes from a variety of Shakespeare's plays; Bell's Edition consisted of illustrations only, each inscribed with a single identificatory line from the drama in question.\n\nSeveral authorities have identified Matthew Liart with a Mathieu Liard, who engraved a Recueil de diff\u00e9rents meubles, published in Paris in 1762. This set consists of four plates with designs for sofas in a rather restrained and graceful late rococo style; it was available from \u2018Liard d\u00e9cinateur [in] Rue de la Harpe\u2019 and another \u2018Liard [in] Rue Jacquelet\u2019. Mathieu Liard was also responsible for a similar, though neo-classical, series, Cahier de petits meubles (1774), and a Cahier de lits de diverses modes, both published by Chereau, and several, probably earlier, sets of chairs and sofas. Given the fact that there seem to have been at least two Liards present in Paris at the time, and that there is no indication that Matthew Liart ever left England, the furniture designs cannot conclusively be attributed to the London-born engraver, who died about 1782, probably in Compton Street, Soho.\n\nPuetz, Anne.

E. Audinet, Philip (1766\u20131837). Rev. Asia Haut. <u>In: Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</u>. Oxford University Press, 2004. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/890, accessed 1 Feb 2010]\nAudinet, Philip (1766\u20131837), engraver, was baptized on 7 December 1766 at St Anne's, Soho, the son of Philip Audinet and his wife, Elizabeth. He was descended from a French family who emigrated to England at the revocation of the edict of Nantes. After having served his apprenticeship with the distinguished engraver John Hall, he was employed to engrave the portraits for Harrison's Biographical Magazine (1794) and other works. Audinet was primarily a portrait and figure engraver who worked mainly in the line manner, but he also produced works in mezzotint and aquatint. His subjects included Lear with the Dead Body of Cordelia, after Henry Fuseli, for Bell's British Theatre (1791\u20135) and several portraits after pictures by Henri-Pierre Danloux, a French painter who resided in England during the time of the revolution in France. Among his later works are larger book-plate portraits of Sir Benjamin Hobhouse, bt, after Thomas Phillips (1825), and Sir William Domville, bt, lord mayor of London, after William Owen, and an excellent engraving of James Barry's unfinished portrait of Dr Johnson. His Henry 5th, his Queen and Family was published in Horace Walpole's Anecdotes of Painting (1827). Audinet also engraved eight plates in the Industry and Idleness series, after William Hogarth, in Hogarth Moralized (1831). There is one plate in mezzotinto by him, a portrait of his brother, Samuel Audinet (b. 1759), a watchmaker. It is said to have been done for improvement when the artist was a boy, and to be the only impression that was taken off the plate. Audinet died a bachelor at his home, 56 Great Russell Street, on 18 December 1837 and was buried in the church of St Giles-in-the-Fields, Holborn.\n\nR. E. Graves, rev. Asia Haut",
