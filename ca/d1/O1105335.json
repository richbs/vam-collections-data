As a student at the Royal College of Art he worked alongside such artists as Graham Sutherland and Edward Bawden, and later, as a teacher,  had considerable influence on a younger group of romantic landscape artists who called themselves the Brotherhood of Ruralists. This print however, made not long after the end of the Second World War, celebrates Britain getting back to industrial production.\n\nThe Artists International Association,or AIA, established in 1935 as the Artists International, was a  left wing organisation with socialist leanings. Its first public exhibition  'Artists Against Fascism and War'  demonstrated the tenor of its thinking and it raised funds for the Republican cause during  the Spanish Civil War.  It organised travelling exhibitions and, notably, published the Everyman Prints which allowed both artists and the public wider access to each other. When Sellars produced this print it still held to its vaguely socialist ideals but in 1953 it became simply an exhibiting society. The AIA dissolved in 1971.",
