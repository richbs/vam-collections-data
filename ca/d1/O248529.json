Another portion is Circ.276-1959.'\n\nNB: Within this book there is a handwritten comment that it would be \u2018unlikely\u2019that these patterns would have been kept together specifically by William Morris.\n\n'FC' refers to; Clark, Fiona. <u>William Morris Wallpapers and Chintzes</u>. New York. 1973.\nParry, Linda, ed. <u>William Morris</u> London : Philip Wilson in association with the Victoria and Albert Museum, 1996. Published to coincide with an exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum, 9 May-1 Sept. 1996, p.211, ill.\nNote: This is with reference to a sample of 'Lily' wallpaper, not this specific object.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows: \n\n'<b>L.9</b> Wallpaper sample, <i>Lily</i> \nDesigned by William Morris, <i>c</i>. 1874 \nPrinted, partially painted in watercolour, attached working notes for printer; 40.0 x 55.0 cm \nArthur Sanderson & Sons Ltd. \n\nThis example gives a valuable insight into the design and production process. Worked on a wash ground, it is at an intermediate stage. Some of the colours are printed but others have been painted on as a guide. The accompanying note with its very precise colour details includes an instruction to get a new block cut. There appear to have been considerable problems with printing <i>Lily</i> as the log book shows several deleted versions. \n\nMorris must have considered <i>Lily</i> particularly suitable for bedrooms; it was used at Kelmscott Manor (fig.85) and in Margaret Burne-Jones\u2019s room at The Grange.'",
