Action Man was relaunched in 1993 by Hasbro, which is the era that this particular Action Man object falls under. \n\nAction figures are particularly popular with boys because they represent traditional masculine traits and are closely associated with the public sphere which is represented by items such as tools, transportation, garages, machines, and military equipment. This particular figure depicts Dr. X, a mad scientist who is the arch-enemy of Action Man. He was introduced in the mid to late 1990s. During the battles with Action Man, Dr X has constantly been defeated and humiliated. However, the evil scientist never seems to give up and each time he comes back to do battle, he grows stronger. However, Action Man always wins the battle and defeats him.",
