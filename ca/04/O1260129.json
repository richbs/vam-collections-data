He has worked in many media including sculpture and drawing. Although not formally trained as a jeweller, he has drawn upon his skills as a sculptor to create jewellery incorporating precious stones and metals, found objects and natural materials. He views his jewellery as \u2018hand-held  sculptures which I couldn't put down\u2019. More recently, he has worked with the Bond Street jewellers, Bentley and Skinner, notably working on the iconic diamond skull made for Damian Hirst in 2007 and is currently working on larger sculptures and stereoscopic drawings and photographs. \n\nHis jewellery from the 1970s and 80s is based upon carving, particularly of woods such as ebony and boxwood, ivory and amber which is often inlaid with gold or silver.  His work can be found in the collection of the Crafts Council, the Goldsmiths Company and the Royal Scottish Museum, Edinburgh.\n",
