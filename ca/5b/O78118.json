Pugin was in charge of decorative furnishings for the Houses of Parliament, known at the time as the New Palace of Westminster.  The pattern for the blind uses the symbols of roses and crowns, both associated with royalty and the aristocracy. Pugin frequently used these symbols in his designs for The Palace of Westminster as they represent the authority of Crown and Parliament.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThere are three versions of this design in the Museum's collections.
