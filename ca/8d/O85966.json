            "public_access_description": "This type of gown is known as a sack back, with a single piece of fabric pleated and stitched at the back of the neck and an open front. It was a style that dominated women\u2019s fashions during the 18th century. It developed from a loose negligee but by the 1770s it had become a more formal type of dress and would have been worn for attending assembly rooms, dinner parties, the theatre or the opera. \n\nThis is a very rare example of the use of velvet in 18th-century women\u2019s dress. Normally fabrics are printed after the weaving process. In the chin\u00e9 technique, the warp threads are printed before, and during weaving the slight pulling of the threads gives the pattern a blurred effect, resembling a watercolour when finished. In this extraordinary example, the chin\u00e9 process has been combined with velvet - a difficult technique that was produced only in a few places in France. The silk for this fabric is reputed to have cost 36 shillings a yard. With an average of 17 yards required for a gown and petticoat of this style, the fabric would today cost about \u00a32,200.",
