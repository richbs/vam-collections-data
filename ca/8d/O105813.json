A feature of the operas at this time were the ballets, which were little more than an opportunity for the young men about town to ogle the ballet girls.  Emma Livry, however, was destined to be one of the most promising dancers of her generation; tragically, in 1862, she died from burns received when her flimsy ballet dress caught fire during a rehearsal.  \nBy the mid-19th century, a recognisable 'ballet' costume had evolved - a low-cut pointed bodice, or a little blouse worn under a laced bodice, and a bell-shaped, knee-length skirt formed of tiers of tarlatan with a diaphanous top layer.   To this were added various details indicating indicate the character, status or nationality of the particular role.  Here, vine leaves around the dress and wreath of grapes in her hair indicate that Livry is appearing in a bacchanal.",

Livry appeared as Erigone in the bacchanal in Act III, as suggested by the vine leaf decoration around the dress and wreath of grapes in her hair.\nThe print is No. 10 in the series Les Danseuses de l'Opera, published ca. 1860.  There were 14 in total, all the work of Alophe.\nThe print is part of the collection of dance prints amassed by Marie Rambert and her husband, Ashley Dukes in the first half of the 20th century.  Eventually numbering over 130 items, it was one of the first and most important specialist collections in private hands.  \nRambert bought the first print as a wedding present but could not bear to give it away.  As the collection grew, it was displayed in the bar of the Mercury Theatre, the headquarters of Ballet Rambert, but in 1968, Rambert gave the collection to the Victoria and Albert Museum.  Although it is often referred to as the Rambert-Dukes collection of Romantic Ballet prints, it includes important engravings of 17th and 18th century performers, as well as lithographs from the later 19th century, by which time the great days of the ballet in London and Paris were over.",

Maybe this was because most photographs were quite small and, of course, sepia toned; translated into lithographs, they could be larger and then hand coloured, making them more suitable for display.",
