It is one of eleven designs in the V&A's collection by Pugin of internal fittings and furniture for the house and is a detail of D. 891-1908. Pugin's designs were to be executed by J.C. Crace of the Crace firm for the owner Henry Sharples in 1847.\n\nAugustus Welby Northmore Pugin (1812-52) is widely considered as one of the most significant and influential architects, designers and theorists of the 19th century. Following his conversion to Catholicism in 1835, he identified the Gothic style with Christian architecture and his work and writings inspired and framed the Gothic Revival. In 'Contrasts', published in 1836, he condemned classical forms and ardently praised 14th and 15th-century architecture. Pugin is best remembered for his work on the Palace of Westminster.",
