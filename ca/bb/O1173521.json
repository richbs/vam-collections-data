He and his detachment sailed from Southampton to France in August 1944, a few weeks after D-Day, and landed at Mulberry Harbour. On board the same ship was an ENSA party which included Gertrude Lawrence, Diana Wynyard, Jessie Matthews and Ivor Novello, and Mr Larbey collected their autographs on the back of his printed message from General Eisenhower. After her signature, Gertrude Lawrence has added \"LST 320\", this being the number of the ship (Landing Ship - Tanks 320). Mr Larbey carried the document in his army pay book until his next leave in the summer of 1945, with consequent creasing of the paper. The document was exhibited in the Imperial War Museum's \"D-day to Victory\" exhibition in 1994-1995, before being given to the Theatre Museum. Associated production: Actors: Gertrude Lawrence, Ivor Novello, Jessie Matthews, Diana Wynyard. Performing company: ENSA. Production type: Wartime Entertainments (World War II).Gertrude Lawrence, Ivor Novello, Jessie Matthews and Diana Wynyard autographed the verso of this copy of Eisenhower's message to the troops.",
