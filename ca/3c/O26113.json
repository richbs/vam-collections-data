It is played with gold and silver columns, representing the building of empires, and coins representing  wealth, on a board marked with similarly coloured circles and diamonds. The aim is to move the columns on one colour into a square shape anywhere in the central part of the board. However, moves may be attempted only if there is a coin of either colour on a diamond adjacent to the column and a vacant space of the same colour. The coins may also be moved to help or hinder the players, and traps may be arranged by using the coins to block a column, which must then be removed to the perimeter starting point. The rules are rather complicated and this game was not one of Waddington's successes.",
