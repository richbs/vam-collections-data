Between 1945-47, he went to study at the Heatherley School of Art, London, and from there on to Paris where he was enrolled at the Academic Andre Lhote between 1948-51 and the Academic Julian between 1953-54. Having studied in London and Paris during the 1940s and 50s he had direct access to European modernism. He says of his influences:\n\" On my return to India in 1951, I began to work on my own. Shedding along the way the classicism and impressionism which was my background and finding myself inextricably held by the single-minded directive of cubism.\" (1968) His landscapes in particular are heavily influenced by Cubism. In 1957, he did a course from the Academic de la Grande Chaumiere. In 1977, Sabavala was awarded the Padma Shri. He lives and works in Mumbai.",
