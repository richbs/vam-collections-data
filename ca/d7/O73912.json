The waisted neck is separated from the body by two mouldings. \nEleven pentagonal facets come down from the rib and imbricate with eleven shorter facets rising from the base. The neck is chamfered, showing thirteen facets. The two mouldings isolating the body from the neck are framed by narrow raised fillets with indentations which are a 10th or 11th century feature.\nThe handle is a flattened cyma-shape with indentations which broaden into a triangular plaque that encircles the opening. This is engraved with a triangle enclosing 2 tendrils and a bud. It's rim has shaped elements but these are no longer identifiable. The eyes of the mythical birds are replaced/represented by roundels engraved with crosses. The gazelle head, on previous models at the base of the handle, is here reduced to an abstract motif.\nThe ewer's most significant feature is the epigraphic band between the two mouldings, written in compact square lettering; the floriated element applied with great restraint.\nPatina: Green and red patches over dark brown.",
