            "history_note": "This clay model or <font -i>bozzetto</font>, dating to about 1580, is constructed of lumps of clay rapidly pressed together to produce the broad outline of the features, form and musculature. Working primarily with his fingers in fairly wet clay, and with very few indications of tool marks, the sculpture shows Giambologna's mastery of clay modelling and his ability to do so with extreme freedom. The bulging muscles are formed out of merged balls or sausages of clay while details such as the eyes, fingers and mouth have been swiftly cut with a pointed tool.\n\nThe results of the thermoluminescence testing suggest a later date than expected which raises the possibility that the sketch was made for a different unidentified scheme. However, this analysis is not accurate enough to allow for a significant reinterpretation, and the association with the <font -i>Appenine</font> remains compelling. As such, the late dating might indicate that the clay <font -i>bozzetto</font> was not fired at the time, a possibility further supported by the solid and rather haphazard construction of the model which does not seem to have been carefully prepared for the kiln.  The sketch may therefore not have been intended as a permanent record but was instead fired subsequently to preserve it, perhaps for a collector. (see <u>Earth and Fire</u> London: 2001)\n\nHistorical significance: The statuette is a dramatic re-working of the Graeco-Roman type of River God, usually shown lying down and supporting itself on one elbow, so as to fill the outside angle of a classical pediment. In this composition, however, Giambologna has transformed the classical theme and endowed the figure with potential movement by pushing him up from the traditional recumbent posture. By repositioning the left arm as though the figure were not at rest and bringing the right arm forward and across the legs, this version appears as if he is about to rise to his feet. In addition, the head is also sharply turned away from the plane of the shoulders and chest, further invigorating the figure by a zigzag of lines running in three dimensions.\n\nGiambologna had in fact already devised an innovative approach to the subject in the three <font -i>River Gods</font> for the Oceanus Fountain (made for the Pitti Palace Gardens in 1570-5 but removed to the Boboli gardens in 1618), shown seated around the fountain basin holding a traditional overflowing vase in front of them, which was suitably piped to produce a jet a water. The attribute has been retained in this terracotta River God, but the water is simply conjured up by adding a piece of clay to the vessel, which was then freely modeled by hand. The loose handling of the clay in this and the two <font -i>Appenine</font> bozzetti clearly demonstrates Giambologna\u2019s direct and lively modeling style.",

            "historical_context_note": "This terracotta probably relates to the plan for a colossal statue symbolising the <font -i>River Nile</font> commissioned by Francesco de\u2019 Medici for the garden of his Villa at Pratolino, Tuscany. For obvious reasons, river gods were a normal component of fountains and gardens, and had appeared on virtually every major example in the mid-sixteenth century such as Montorsoli's <font -i>Fountain of Orion</font> (1547-53) and Ammanati's wall fountains of <font -i>Tiber</font> and <font -i>Arno</font> (1550-5). Giambologna would have been familiar with the numerous surviving examples from his intensive study of sculpture in Rome between 1550-53, and again in 1572, when he was sent there by Cosimo I de\u2019 Medici along with Vasari and his fellow sculptor Ammanati. Indeed, the Florentine Medici family's patronage of Giambologna led to a style that was closely associated with the Medici court, and which quickly spread to northern Europe.\n\nThis specific model, however, was never actually executed, but in its place Giambologna created the figure of the mountain god, <font -i>Apennine</font>, for which there is a sketch-model in the Museo Nazionale in Florence. Constructed primarily of brick, stone, and lava, and embellished with dripped stucco to appear organic, <font -i>Appenine</font> rises above the Medici villa, to a height of 10m, and houses a series of small rooms inside and beneath it. Originally connected with the school of Michelangelo, the model was variously attributed before gaining acceptance as one of three known models connected with the Pratolino project. The others \u2013 a terracotta in the Bargello, Florence and a damaged clay model in the Mus\u00e9e Muncipal,  \u201cLa Chartreuse\u201d, Douai \u2013 are both extremely free handled representations of the <font -i>Apennine</font> and were therefore made subsequently.",
