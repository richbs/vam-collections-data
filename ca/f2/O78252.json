By the time he died he had produced over 500 prints, including sets of the Senses, the Planets and the Twelve Ceasars, as well as many portrait and costume prints.\n\nDesign & Designing\nIn this print Abraham de Bruyn has deployed a huge variety of ornamental motifs in the border framing the central oval. They include men in armour, naked men - possibly sea gods riding on sea monsters -, strange creatures that are half- animal and half-snail, a mask, vases, flowers, branches of leaves, scrolling foliage, flags and hanging drapery. All these elements are organised symmetrically. There is as much to look at outside the oval frame as inside it.\n\nPrinted Design Sources\nThe set of six oval-framed scenes from the life of Perseus on which this print is based were a source for a number of interiors in England at the beginning of the 17th century. This print is in black and white but anyone using it as a printed design source had to adapt it to new materials, change its scale and make their own decisions about whether or not to paint or gild the object they were copying it onto.",
