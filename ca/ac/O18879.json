The necklace shows obvious European influence in its form and claw-set stones, but the motifs are larger than those of Western models and the gauge of the metal slightly thicker.\n\nThe piece was acquired as being from Madras from an unnamed exhibition in 1855 by the Indian Museum. This museum was formed by the East India Company in the early 19th century and housed in the company\u2019s premises in London, before being divided between the South Kensington Museum (now the V&A) and the British Museum in 1879. The necklace was approvingly described at the time as having \u2018a very chaste design\u2019.",
