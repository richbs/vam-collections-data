II, p. 63; Foster 1914-16, vol. I, pl. LXI, no. 153 (as <i>Teniers the Younger</i> by Gerbier, but at text p. 53 as <i>Teniers the Elder</i>), vol. II, p. 117, no. 6; <i>Catalogue of Miniatures</i>, 1908, p. 19 (as signed and dated); Long 1929, p. 170 ('reason to think that [portraits of Teniers and his wife at SK 1865] were not by Gerbier'): Long 1930, p. 91 (as with a spurious signature); <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981 (as <i>Teniers the Younger</i>, falsely signed). \n\nThe miniature is based on a self-portrait by Teniers the Younger, which dates from after 1650, when he moved to Brussels and acquired the insignia of office in the household of Archduke Leopold (which he displays in the painting but not in the miniature). It was accompanied in the Hawkins Collection by another miniature, similarly 'signed', understood to represent Teniers' wife. The latter was bought at the Hawkins sale by Edward Hodgkin, a private collector, and passed successively to Hans Freiherr von Reitges in Vienna and thence to Greta Heckett in Pittsburgh. It was at her sale in 1977, catalogued as a genuine work by Gerbier and with no reference to this miniature, which had long since been relegated to the status of a pastiche. (1) \n\nA date of 1627 for either of these miniatures should have been obviously impossible on grounds of costume, hair, and even of the sky background. Long was aware of this, but he did not make progress with alternative suggestions until, in correspondence with his friend Dr A Staring, the Dutch scholar, he looked at the engraved portraits of Teniers and especially that by Lucas Vorstermann after Pieter Thys, (2) which showed that the sitter was certainly the younger rather than the elder Teniers. Staring contributed the reference to the actual self-portrait, which he knew from its reproduction, together with a pendant portrait of Ieniers' wife, in the catalogue of the Pelzer sale. (3) Neither Staring nor Long thought that the paintings were the actual source for the miniatures, for the heads were differently placed and must therefore have been painted at a different sitting. They still thought that this miniature, at least, was an authentic seventeenth-century object, but some twenty-five years later than the false signature and date purported. This was Long's formal view, which duly appeared in Long 1930, but privately he had noted in the department file, 3 January 1928, after removing the miniature from its frame for the first time, that it dated 'probably from the last decade of the 18th or the early part of the 19th century. If it has an older basis, it must have been a good deal retouched, but I do not think it has an older basis. Even as it is, there is [much] retouching.' Implicitly, therefore, though tentatively, Long regarded the miniature as a pastiche, largely derived from the self-portrait and presumably 'converted' some time later, when the identity of the sitter had been forgotten, into a 'Gerbier' of 1627 . This is surely right. \n\n1 Sotheby's London 11 July 1977, lot 129; it is interesting that, when the companion ex-Hawkins miniature of Terriers' wife reappeared thus in London, the sitter was not, as expected, the same as in the ex-Pelzer painting (see below, note 3).The sitter for the latter was Anne, born Breughel 'de Velours', who died in May 1656. The sitter in the miniature could be Isabella, Teniers' second wife, but that would mean that it was not the ex-Pelzer paintings, but another pair, that provided the starting point for the miniatures.\n2 Repro.
