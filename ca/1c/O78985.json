Exeter, the county's leading city, was a centre of woodcarving and joinery, and amongst the most famous workshops were those of the Garrett and Hermon families. Decoration in the style of Hans Vredeman de Vries (1527-?1606) and other North European engravers, copied from imported prints and books, was often found in houses belonging to urban merchants and the landed gentry. \n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe column represents the story of Adam and Eve after their expulsion from the Garden of Eden. Adam holds a spade for his toil, whilst Eve holds an apple and the hair of a serpent with the facial features of a woman; it was the serpent who tempted her to eat from the tree of knowledge.\n\nDesign & Designers\nThe column is a mixture of vernacular carving and classicial ornament. Caryatids, upright figures surmounted with the capital of a column, recurred in European engravings, such as those of Hans Vredeman de Vries. The column itself is sufficiently correct to suggest some knowledge of prints after the treatise of the 16th-century Italian architect Sebastiano Serlio. However the figures are carved in a vernacular and totally unclassical style.",
