This is presumably Simon Pietersz Verelst (1644-1721), and F Lewis's monograph of that artist (Leigh-on-Sea, 1979) reproduces an almost identical composition (in colour, p51, cat no 47a; 75 x 62.3 cm (29\u00bd x 24\u00bd ins), Richard Green Fine Paintings Ltd). However, Lewis also notes two other similar compositions, one nearer the size of the present work (l 06.7 x 88.9 cm (42 x 35 ins), Broughton collection), the other sold at Bonham's 13 July 1978 (lot 78, 92.7 x 68.6 cm (36\u00bd x 27 ins), present whereabouts unknown). \n\nA label on the back reads 'For Sale price \u00a33 5s'. It may well have been the work of an amateur or a student who subsequently followed another career (although the quality of the painting is good), and was purchased by the Museum, as was the practice, as an example for future students.\"",
