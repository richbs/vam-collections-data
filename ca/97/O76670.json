They are used to transport possessions on pack animals when the community travels and are used for storage and decoration, and as something comfortable to lean against, when the community settles for a while and erects tents.  The two sides of a bag, back and front, are called 'faces' and the one at the front is often decorated with knotted pile or with a woven design.  The loose red and blue woollen threads extending from one side of this bag face are all that remain of the decorative overstitching which would have joined together the back and front. It was presented to the donor's grandfather, EHS Clarke, in 1885 while he was a member of the Durand Mission to Afghanistan.",
