Kate Terry (1844-1924) was the eldest daughter of the actors Ben Terry and Sarah Ballard, and all her brothers and sisters went on the stage from an early age, her most famous sister being Henry Irving's leading lady, Ellen Terry.  Kate began her stage career aged eight, as Prince Arthur in Charles Kean's production of King John and stayed in Kean's company until he retired, playing Cordelia to his King Lear when she was 14.\n\nThe bracelet is engraved with a quote from Posthumus's speech to Imogen (Cymbeline, Act I) engraved on the outer surface  ('It is a manacle of love; I'll place it upon this fairest prisoner\"), and a list of all Kate Terry's roles, the plays and their dates, engraved on the inside. Within the green-enamelled laurel leaf garland are their intertwined initials set with diamonds. This is the lid to the locket compartment, on which is engraved Lewis's dedication to his wife and the date, 5 October 1867. It was given to the actress Irene Worth by Kate Terry's great-nephew, the actor Sir John Gielgud.",

There is a quote from Posthumus's speech to Imogen ('Cymbeline' Act 1) engraved on the outer surface  ('It is a manacle of love; I'll place it upon this fairest prisoner\"), and a list of all Kate Terry's roles, the plays and their dates, engraved on the inside. The bracelet was commissioned for Kate Terry  by Arthur Lewis and presented to her on 5 October 1867. Within the green-enamelled laurel leaf garland are their intertwined initials set with diamonds. This is the lid to the locket compartment, on which is engraved Lewis's dedication to his wife, and the date.\n\nIt was given to Irene Worth by John Gielgud, who was the great-nephew of Kate Terry.  The bracelet had a letter of the provenance attached, with the handwritten note: 'Upon my death I wish this bracelet to go to the Theatre Museum - London - England. Covent Garden. Irene Worth. 17 Feb 1989.'",
