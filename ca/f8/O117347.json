Both field and lozenge have the Herati pattern on the same scale with narrow diamonds and almost vertical leaves. The diamonds in the field are red; those in the lozenge are varied in colour. Along the sides, between the sides of the field and those of the lozenge are 18 or 21 inward facing sprigs, giving the appearance of half hexagons.\n\nMAIN BORDER: dark brown ground with floral meander on a striped stem; the rosette is between paired leaves; the other motif is palmette-like.\n\nINNER AND OUTER BORDERS: white ground with angular geometric meander of elongated S-motifs in many colours.\n\nWARP: white wool with some brown wool; Z2S; depressed; 36-38 threads per inch (140 per dm).\n\nWEFT: white wool; Z4S; 2 shoots after each row of knots; 12 knots per inch (48 per dm).\n\nPILE: wool. 13 colours: red, yellow, dark green, green, light green, dark blue, blue, light blue, dark brown, brown, light brown, black, white; asymmetrical knot open to the left and tied around 2 threads; 216-228 knots per sq. inch (3360 per sq. dm).\n\nSide finish: one cord oversewn with red and green wool. There are small tufts attached at intervals along the right hand side. There is a short plait at the lower left hand corner.\n\nEnd finish: Lower: warp loops around a stout weft cord. 3 cms warp faced plain weave with red weft and then with white wool. Above this is one row of weft twining in red/green wool. Upper: 1 row of weft twining in blue/yellow and a fringe secured with a single knot (incomplete).",
