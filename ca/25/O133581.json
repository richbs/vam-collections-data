That the original was copied at all is a sign of the poularity of the subject matter at the time.\n\nThe lettering shows that this print was aimed at an educated audience who could read and understand Latin. It says that this vase is like the ones made in bronze and marble by sculptors in ancient Rome. This statement may not be entirely true as the type of ring shown on the side of the vase set with what is probably meant to be an uncut diamond, was much more common in the sixteenth century than in Ancient Rome. \n\nA great flowering of interest in archaeology in Rome and throughout Italy in the fifteenth and the sixteenth centuries combined with a careful study of the writings of ancient Roman and Greek authors are seen as defining characteristics of the phenomenon given the name the Renaissance in the nineteenth century.",
