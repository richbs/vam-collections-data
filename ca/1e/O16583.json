            "public_access_description": "When Holbein painted this image in 1536, it was virtually unknown in England for anyone other than courtiers to be recorded in a portrait. Until then portraiture had been a part of the funeral traditions of the powerful rather than a celebration of more modest lives. This beautiful miniature, however, shows that almost from the moment of its invention the portrait miniature was not exclusively a court art. A coat of arms, painted on a piece of vellum long associated with this portrait and set in the lid, identifies the sitter as \u2018Mrs Pemberton\u2019. This identification had always been something of a puzzle, since Mrs Pemberton appeared to be the wife of an obscure country gentleman living in a Northamptonshire village, far from both the court and Holbein\u2019s practice in London. Recently, however, the evidence has been reinterpreted, and the more likely explanation is that the sitter was Mrs Jane Small, whose maiden name was Pemberton. Jane was the wife of a prosperous London merchant, Nicholas Small, and they were close neighbours of Holbein. It is not known if she was painted for a particular occasion, or why she is shown wearing a red flower and two ears of corn and holding a leaf.",

At the back, on vellum, is painted the coat of arms of Pemberton-More, dated 1556. Diameter 5.3 cm \nP.40-1935. <i>Formerly in the Collection of J. Pierpont Morgan. \nPurchased from the Funds of Captain H B Murray's Bequest, together with donations from Viscount Bearsted and the National Art-Collections Fund</i>.\n\nHolbein was born in Augsburg, the son and, eventually, the pupil of a painter of the same name. About 1514 he went to Basle where he was initially principally employed as a designer for printers. He remained in that city, apart from short visits to France and - possibly - Italy, until 1526, when he paid his first visit to England. He remained there until 1528 and painted a number of portraits of courtiers, including the famous group portrait of the More family. On his return to Basle he found that the fanaticism of Protestant extremism severely reduced the amount of work available to him. He returned to England in 1532, remaining there until his death and enjoying royal and court patronage from 1536. \n\nQueen Jane Seymour died in 1537 and in 1539 Thomas Cromwell, then Lord Treasurer and later Earl of Essex, opened negotiations for the King's marriage to Anne, daughter of the Protestant Duke of Cleves, such an alliance appearing politically advantageous. The English ambassador cautiously reported that 'I hear no great praise of her personage, nor of her beauty' and in the Spring of 1539 the King asked for a portrait, but none was forthcoming. In the Summer the King sent Holbein to Duren, near Cologne, to paint Anne's portrait. An oil-painting, now in the Louvre, and the present miniature resulted. \n\nThe marriage treaty was signed in September and Anne reached England in December, to be greeted with dismay by her wooer who thought her no better than 'a Flander's mare'. However, the marriage took place in January 1540, to be followed in July by an annulment on the grounds of non consummation. The political miscalculation cost Cromwell his life at the end of that July, but the ex-queen was well-treated and lived contentedly in England until her death. \n\nWhatever the relationship of the portrait to reality Horace Walpole's high praise of the miniature as 'the most exquisitely perfect of all Holbein's works, as well as in the highest preservation' remains apposite. The ivory box in which the miniature is housed probably dates from the 17th century. \n\nThe history of the portrait of \u2018Mrs Pemberton\u2019 is veiled in obscurity. The sitter is traditionally believed to be Elizabeth Throckmorton, wife of Robert Pemberton, although the identification cannot be proved. The arms, dated 1556, which appear on the reverse of the case are Pemberton above Longworth impaling More and appear to relate to a Pemberton-More marriage some fifteen or sixteen years later than the miniature itself, which must be dated to c.1540. \nThe nature of the connection between the portrait and the arms is as yet unexplained. Whatever the identity of the sitter this cool, dispassionate portrait exemplifies (along with the Anne of Cleves portrait) a recent critical comment that 'For Holbein himself scale seems to have been almost a matter of indifference; it was simply a question of what size of image was wanted' and that it 'is as dense and monumental in characterization as any bigger portrait'.\n\nHarold Barkley\"\nStrong, Roy. <u>Artists of the Tudor Court: the Portrait Miniature Rediscovered 1520-1620.</u>.

Full Citation:\n\n\"HANS HOLBEIN\n\n<b>29 ?Margaret Throckmorton, Mrs Robert Pemberton</b>, c. 1536\n\n<i>Victoria & Albert Museum (P.40-1935)</i>\nVellum stuck to a playing card with five hearts verso, circular, 52 mm, 2 1/16 in diam.\n\nMargaret Throckmorton (d.1576) was the daughter of Richard Throckmorton of Higham Ferrers.  She married, at an unknown date Robert Pemberton.\n\nThe identity depends of the coat of arms, mounted onto vellum stuck to a playing card which is inserted separately at the back of the miniature, bearing the year 1566, but the painting is 17th century in date.  The arms are those of Robert Pemberton of Pemberton, Lans and of Rushden (d.1594) impaling those of his wife Margaret Throckmorton.  There is nothing to disprove this identity and, indeed, the absence of jewellery and simplicity of dress argue for modest rank.  She was one of the younger daughters of a country gentleman but not without connections.  Her aunt by marriage, or firt cousin\u2019s wife, was Catherine, Lady Throckmorton, sister to Thomas 2nd Lord Vaus who sat for Holbein (information from the Hon Clare Stuart Wortley, 1935; Parker, <i>Holbein</i>, 1945, nos. 24, 30) and her Throckmorton cousins had posts at court.  In spite of this a sitter of her rank is quite exception among early Tudor miniatures, but Holbein\u2019s sitters were never confined to the narrow range of Hornebolte\u2019s.  The costume and pose are virtually duplicated in the portrait of a woman with a white coif at Detroit (Ganz, <i>Holbein</i>, pl. 123) which Gantz dates c. 1534.  It is usual to date Mrs. Pemberton c. 1540-43 but it is most closely related in introspection of mood to Holbein\u2019s Margaret Rorer of 1536.  Both look back to the portraits of ladies of the More family and circle during Holbein\u2019s first period, for after he entered royal service in 1537 the treatment became progressively more iconic and the sitters wholly of the court.\n\nThe background is discoloured and a number of paint losses have been crudely restored.\n\nINSCRIBED: On either side of the head: <i>ANNO / ETATOS SVAE 23</i>\n\nCOLLECTIONS: First recorded in 1865 when lent to the South Kensington Exhibition by Mr. J.
