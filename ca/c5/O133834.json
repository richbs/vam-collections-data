Above we see a god sitting on an elephant and below, a hunter who has just fired an arrow at the tree. \nAt the centre of the painting we see an extract of the Ramayana written in Hindi. In this painting, the artist has applied bright green and yellow in loosely defined areas. Pop influences and oriental calligraphic art are deployed by the artist  to depict an Indian mythological subject.\n\nRedappa Naidu was born in 1932. The artist trained at the Government College of Arts & Crafts in Madras. He held his first one-man show in 1958.
