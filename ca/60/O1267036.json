A tangram is a dissection puzzle comprising 7 flat shapes (square, triangular and trapezoid) which are put together to form shapes. The objective of the puzzle is to form a specific shape (given only an outline or silhouette) using all seven pieces, which may not overlap. It was originally invented in China during the Song Dynasty and then carried over to Europe by trading ships in the early 19th century. It is one of the most popular dissection puzzles in the world. Barham used acrylic shapes as her printing blocks. Each piece is printed to leave a fine white line between it and the adjacent shapes, so that it is clear how each letter has been constructed. Her letters are clever and elegant solutions to the challenge of devising an alphabet from tangram pieces.",
