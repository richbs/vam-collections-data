Apprenticed to a house painter from about 1808-15, and also worked as a theatrical scenery painter. Moved to London 1822; worked at Theatre Royal and Covent Garden. Achieved a high reputation as a painter in oils and watercolours, mainly of architectural views. Exhibited 101 works at the RA between 1826 and 1864, 32 at the BI 1825-59, and 50 at the SBA 1824-36 (elected Member 1825, President 1830). Elected ARA 1838, RA 1841. Travelled frequently and extensively; from his first visit to France 1824, he toured in Belgium, Holland, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the Near East. Published lithographic reproductions of his drawings, notably 'Picturesque Sketches in Spain' (1837) and 'The Holy Land, Syria, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt and Nubia' (1842-9). Died 25 November 1864; his studio sale was at Christie's 13-20 May 1865, and that of his son-in-law Henry Bicknell 7-9 April 1881. \n\t\nLIT:  J Ballantine <u>The Life of David Roberts</u>, RA 1866; H Guiterman (et al) <u>David Roberts</u>; Artist Adventurer Scottish Arts Council exhibition catalogue 1981; H Guiterman and B Llewellyn David Roberts Barbican Art Gallery exhibition catalogue 1986 \n\n<b>Entrance to the Crypt, Roslin Chapel</b> \nFA174 Neg 57004 \nPanel, 71.6 X 62.1 cm (30 X 24\u00bd ins) \nSigned and dated (indistinctly) 'David Roberts RA 1843' diagonally bl \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nExhibited at the RA in 1843. The artist was in Edinburgh in 1842 for a public dinner given in his honour on 19 October. Roslin (or Rosslyn), near Edinburgh, was one of Roberts's favourite places: a watercolour study of the chapel is dated 11 October 1842 and part of it was used for the present oil (NGS). There are several oils of the subject recorded, and many watercolours, one also in the V&A collections signed and dated 1830 (1046-1873). \nRoslin Chapel, celebrated for its sculpture and elaborate decorative carving, was founded in 1446; it was only partly completed, damaged in 1668, and restored in 1862. \nThe<i> Art Union</i> noted it as: \n \nOne of the class of pictures called interiors, abounding with stone carving of a rich and florid character. The work is remarkable for the softness and transparency of its shadows, and the power displayed in painting the cross lights. The subject is bisected by a heavy column, a little beyond which are two figures who do not support the feelings generated by such work. \n\nThe figures presumably serve to draw attention to the famous Prentice Pillar; its unusual design of four strips of foliage spiralling upwards, with a base of entwined serpents, is supposed (according to an unlikely legend) to have resulted in the murder of the apprentice who carved it while his master mason was absent. \n\nEXH: RA 1843 (78); BI 1844 (12); RSA 1845 (37); <i>International Exhibition</i> Dublin 1865 (189); <i>David Roberts: Artist Adventurer</i> Scottish Arts Council 1981-2 (44) \n\nLIT: <u>Art Union</u> 1843, p163 \n\n\nRonald Parkinson.\"\n<u>Vikutoria & Arub?to Bijutsukan-z? : eikoku romanshugi kaigaten = The Romantic tradition in British painting, 1800-1950 : masterpieces from the Victoria and Albert Museum / selected by Mark Evans</u> [Japan : Brain Trust], 2002. 185 p. : ill.
