The legs are widely splayed and the feet large. The muzzle is a separate inset of shaven cloth with a rectangular vertically stitched nose and wide inverted Y mouth, both of brown thread. The eyes are brown plastic with black pupils and are set close together. The ears are separate pieces sewn onto the sides of the head. On top of the head is sewn a cap of soft black nylon mohair with a piece of black mantilla lace attached. Around the bear's neck is a shawl of black mantilla lace edged with black nylon mohair and fastened at the front with a metal brooch inset with a deep red plastic imitation jewel. There is a swing tag on a yellow thread sewn into the centre seam at the top of the body and a white label printed in black sewn into right upper arm seam. Around the neck on a gold elasticated piece of string is a pale beige card printed on both sides in light brown. One side gives a brief history of the Hermann company and the other has details of the bear - \"Queen Victoria (1819-1901) To commemorate Her Majesty No. 10 of  a limited edition of 500 pieces\" with the logo, the signature of Martin J Hermann and details of the company.",
