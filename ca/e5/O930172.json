CREMONA: early 17th century 832 Allegorical figure in armour, with a trumpet, seated on a cloud Inscribed at two different points on the dress \u2018G\u2019 and \u2018R\u2019 in very small writing, probably by the artist, though in a blacker ink than the rest; inscribed in a later hand in pencil along the bottom edge \u2018D. Piola\u2019 Pen and ink and wash 9 \u00bc x 7 (235 x 177) D.207-1889 PROVENANCE Bought 1889 The drawing is not by Piola, under whom it was formerly catalogued. The style suggests a date early in the 17th century and a Cremonese artist, like Malasso.",
