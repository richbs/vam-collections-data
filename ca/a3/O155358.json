The borders are edged with black.\nThe pattern is a series of diagonal lines from lower right to upper left.  These are chevron lines in pink and dark blue.\nThere are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: large and small pink blossoms.\n[2] wider stripe in two designs: [a] green ground with a downward pointing stem and one pink flowerhead, small pale blossoms form a square around this;  a branching stem with 3 pink flowerheads.
