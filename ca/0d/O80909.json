Certainly, French engravings show brackets of this type supporting small Rococo vases, although the earliest such vases from the Derby porcelain factory are slightly later in date. Similar brackets were also used for supporting vases made at the royal French porcelain factory at S\u00e9vres. In 1775 Lady Sarah Bunbury advised a friend with property in Ireland that 'if the [drawing room] hangings are white, their plainness must be broken by your pretty blue and green S\u00e9vres china vases, on pretty brackets'. Ceramic figures were also displayed on brackets in the middle years of the 18th century: 'single Figures for Brackets' were included in an auction of Chelsea porcelain held in 1759.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe brackets may have been inspired by French gilt-bronze examples. Their designer had a remarkably good understanding of the principles of continental Rococo design. The Derby porcelain factory may have bought the casting models for these and other early Rococo pieces from freelance London sculptors.",
