Small mass-produced busts as these were also popular since the owner would have felt they bestowed the mark of a cultivated person when displayed in their home.\n\nThis bust is not named but probably represents the great tragic actress Sarah Siddons (1755-1831) who, with her brother Stephen Kemble, dominted the English stage of the late eighteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Sarah Siddons was the youngest of the actor Roger Kemble's twelve children and spent her formative years with the family theatre company, travelling up and down the country.  The family's first appearance at Drury Lane Theatre in the 1775 to 1776 season was not a success but when she appeared there again as Isabella in The Fatal Marriage, she was celebrated as the perfect noble tragic heroine, creating a legend that lasted until her retirement in 1812.",
