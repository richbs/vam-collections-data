            "public_access_description": "Balthasar Jenichen made this portrait of artist and printmaker Virgil Solis in the year of Solis's death. Jenichen was a journeyman printer and painter who worked in Solis' workshop and took over the business after his master's death. This image depicts Solis as an engraver. He is holding a burin and a metal plate engraved with a design similar to playing cards that he issued.  In front of him on the bench are his tools, including a burin, a sharpening stone and a double-ended etching needle. \n\nThough cut off from this print, an epitaph below found on other examples reads like an advert. It was perhaps used as such since the workshop continued to use Solis' name and his plates. The inscription describes Solis' various activities; engraving, etching and drawing for woodcuts, as well as illuminating and painting.",
