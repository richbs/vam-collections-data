These are known as tracery lights.\n\nSt James was one of the Twelve Apostles, whom Christ appointed to be his special disciples. After his Resurrection, Christ charged them with spreading his teachings. James became known as \u2018the Less\u2019 to distinguish him from another Apostle called James (\u2018the Greater\u2019). The Sanhedrin, the supreme Jewish council, sentenced him to death in AD 62. He was martyred by stoning and clubbing.\n\nThe saints of the Christian church can often be identified by a device, which is known as their \u2018attribute\u2019. In this panel St James holds a fuller\u2019s club, which is used in the textile dying industry. The Golden Legend, an influential compilation of saints\u2019 lives written about 1260, describes his martyrdom. The elders of the Sanhedrin threw James from the top of the temple and killed him by splitting his head open with such a club.\n\nSt James bears a scroll on which are written in Latin the words \u2018He ascended to Heaven and sits on the right hand of God\u2019. This is a line from the \u2018Apostles\u2019 Creed\u2019, a statement of faith in the Christian church. It begins: \u2018I believe in God the Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth\u2019. A tradition dating back at least to the end of the 4th century states that the Twelve Apostles gathered together after the Ascension of Christ. The Holy Spirit inspired them to write the Apostles\u2019 Creed, each contributing a line. \n\nThe Twelve Apostles often formed part of large decorative schemes in the Middle Ages. They are the backbone upon which the Christian faith spread throughout the world.",

            "historical_context_note": "This panel was originally located in the upper lights (openings) of a larger window. These are known as tracery lights.\n\nSt James is one of the Twelve Apostles, appointed by Christ himself as his special disciples and given charge of the spreading of Christ's teachings after his death. He became known as 'the Less' to distinguish him from another apostle, also called James ('the Greater'). He was martyred in Jerusalem in 62 AD after being sentenced by the Sanhedrin, the supreme Jewish council, to stoning.\n\nThe saints of the Christian church can often be identified by a device which is known as their 'attribute'. In this panel St James holds a fuller's club. According to the Golden Legend, an influential manuscript of saints' lives compiled in the middle of the 13th century, the elders of the Sanhedrin threw James from the top of the temple and then killed him by splitting his head open with a fuller's club. A fuller's club is used in the textile dying industry.\n\nSt James bears a scroll on which are written the words, translated from Latin, 'He ascended to Heaven and sits on the right hand of God'. This is a line from the 'Apostles' Creed'. This was and still is a statement of faith in the Christian Church. It begins 'I believe in God the Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth\u2026'. A tradition dating back at least to the end of the 4th century, states that the 12 Apostles, gathered together after the death of Christ, were inspired by the Holy Spirit and wrote the Apostles Creed, each contributing a line.\n\nThe twelve apostles often formed part of a large decorative schemes in the Middle Ages. They are the backbone upon which the Christian faith was spread throughout the world.",
