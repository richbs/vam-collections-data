He became famous on both sides of the Atlantic for his act filled with dozens of tricks and performed at lightning speed. His signature illusion, Sawing a Woman in Half, was inspired by P.T.Selbit's similar act, Sawing Through a Woman. When other performers began to copy Goldin's effect, he replaced it with a spectacular Buzzsaw version, illustrated on the front cover of the leaflet.\n\nThe leaflet also advertises the book of tricks written by Horace Goldin, and tricks that could be bought from Will Goldstone Ltd., London's leading magic dealer. The son of a Polish tailor born in Liverpool, Will Goldston started his career in 1905 running the Theatrical and Entertainments department of Gamages store in Holborn.",
