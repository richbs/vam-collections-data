GARBO, RAFFAELLINO DEL (c. 1466-1524) 5. Fragment showing a cupboard, with a vase of lilies and an open book standing on it, and above it an interrupted circle of angels' heads grouped round a dove The frieze of the cupboard inscribed by the artist 'AVE GRATIA' Inscribed on the back and front of the mount in pencil in a roth or zoth century hand 'Lippi' Pen and brown ink and wash, heightened with white, on a pink washed surface 5 3/8 x 3 3/4 (136 x 95) 2256 PROVENANCE Sir T. Lawrence (Lugt 2445); S. Woodburn (sale, Christie, 4-8 June 1860, unidentified lot, bought for the Museum) Formerly anonymous. The name of Raffaellino was suggested tentatively by Popham (1963). The drawing is too slight and fragmentary to make a confident attribution possible, but it certainly seems to belong to the circle of Filippino Lippi. It is probably part of a larger composition showing the Annunciation to the Virgin.",
