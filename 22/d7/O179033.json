He first worked as a bank clerk in Whitchurch and Manchester while attending evening classes at the Manchester School of Art. In 1872 he moved to London and studied briefly at the Slade School of Fine Art. \nHe did a lot of book illustrations and was one of the first to avoid the then so popular black-and-white effects. He did skillful watercolours and oil drawings set amidst the vernacular architecture of his childhood, often infused with a sense of humour. Apparently even Van Gogh and Gauguin admired his work.",
