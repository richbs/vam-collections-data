Approximately 40 to 60 stools and matching chairs were supplied for the basement bar, all with painted panels to make them more durable. Windmill Furniture subsequently put the Flight Stool into production. They also manufacture the design on behalf of the Italian furniture company Cappellini. In 1998, at the Designers Block exhibition held at the Truman Brewery in Brick Lane, London, Cappellini sponsored an installation that consisted of several Flight stools suspended in an arc from floor to ceiling. The stools were specially moulded so that the legs opened out wider and wider towards the top of the arc. This simulated a bird launching itself into flight.",

These interiors have become important test beds for contemporary design ideas and the means by which cutting edge design has been popularised.  Moreover, specially commissioned furniture for these interiors has been put into production for the domestic and contract markets.  Examples include Coast (designed by Marc Newson), Belgo (designed by Ron Arad) and Pharmacy (chairs designed by Jasper Morrison).  This is the contemporary context for and significance of the Flight Stool.",

This means that a BOA design ordered from Cappellini in this country will in fact be made by Windmill but labelled as Cappellini..The two companies have negotiated their pricing so equivalent Windmill and Cappellini products retail for the same amount in Britain.", 
            "historical_context_note": "This stool was originally designed for the bar of the Soho Brewing Company, 41 Earlham Street, Covent Garden, London, WC2H 1LD,  when it opened in 1998.  (The company subsequently changed its name in 1999 to the Freedom Brewery Co, even though there was no change in ownership.)  The young architects Ed Barber and Jay Osgerby undertook the entire fit-out of the basement bar, which is also a micro-brewery.  Approximately forty to sixty stools and corresponding chairs (which are identical to the stools with added backs) were supplied. The Flight Stool was subsequently put into production by Windmill Furniture, London, who made the furniture for the bar commission.  \n\nThe stool is also manufactured by Windmill on behalf of the Italian furniture company Cappellini.  In 1998, at the Designers Block exhibition held at the Truman Brewery in Brick Lane, London E1, Cappellini sponsored an installation of the Flight Stool, in which special mouldings of the chair simulated the opening of a bird's wings as it launched itself into flight.\n\nThe stool comes in three finishes: birch, walnut, and birch with a painted panel at the base.",
