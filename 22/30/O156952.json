Note: some areas of a large floral motif near the upper end are piled with silk using the same colours as appear elsewhere in wool.  This area might have been intended to be the middle of the completed length and may therefore (?) have been prominant.  Symmetrical knot tied around 3 threads with one uncovered thread between each knot.  260 knots per sq. inch (4080 per sq. dm).\n\nSIDE FINISH: one cord oversewn, or possibly overcast, with red wool\n\nEND FINISH: Lower: there are two thicker wefts after the fringe of warp thread loops that have been twisted into a mass of approx 8 cms. in length.  Upper: uncompleted: an incomplete panel with central axis has long loose warp threads of max 43 cms. extending beyond the last existing weft thread.  The warp threads are twisted into 16 unequal strands, the outer 4 on both sides are multicoloured from the inner and outer borders' coloured warp.\n\nDESIGN: Field: plain weave ground with long sequences of piled motifs, sometimes flowering plants and sometimes geometrical, all symmetrical along a central axis.  These sequences are separated by rectangular panels in mainly geometric motifs.  The lower end is unpiled and is 100 cms. in length.  Across it are 8 bands of narrow, interlocking diamonds and triangles (weft-floated over the warp-faced ground).  There is an initial fringe or irregular groups of warp threads twisted together in a Z direction to form a mass of threads, max 10 cms. long.  Before the first piled panel is a band of single knots in a variety of colours and then two spaced bands, each a single line in weft-wrapping, green alternating with red.  The piled area begins with a band of red lozenges lying between a line of knots (as above) and then a line of weft-wrapping (as above).  The upper end of the tent band is missing as though weaving was abruptly stopped.\n\nMain border: a zigzag outlined in blue.\nInner border: a row and two halves of a white floret within a partial concentric, mainly red lozenge.\n\nOuter border: diagonal blocks of colour.\nThe borders stopp at the end of the piled section and from then on, there is on the lower end panel an outer red and an inner red and blue warp stripe border.\n\nCatalogue date: 24.4.96",
