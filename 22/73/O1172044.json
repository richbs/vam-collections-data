It was one of three leading market home computers in the 1980s along with the Spectrum ZX and the Commodore 64. The series released a total of six distinct models. The CPC464, CPC664, and CPC6128 were highly successful competitors in the home computer market. Games were purchased in a tape format and were loaded into the in-built tape deck and could take around 20 minutes to load before they could be played. Apparatus such as joysticks improved the game play. Examples of available games for this computer were a computer version of Scrabble, Winter Games and Dizzy. During its lifetime, the CPC series sold approximately three million units.",

She and her brother Thomas (b. 30/11/1974) played with the computer. They lived in Walderslade, a large village close to Chatham, Kent.\nSamantha remembers waiting for the games to load up which could take some time. The picture was built up from lines across the screen and was accompanied by a high pitched sound. It would sometimes crash just before the picture was complete and one had to start all over again.\nTheir favourite games were the Daley Thompson's SuperTest Challenges and they spent hours learning them and trying to beat each other.",
