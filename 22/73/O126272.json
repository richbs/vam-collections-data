His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nMessel designed sets for The Little Hut (1950), a light comedy by Andr\u00e9 Roussin adapted by Nancy Mitford (1904-1973), about a husband, wife and her lover wrecked on a desert island.   Directed by Peter Brook (1925-), the play enjoyed a long run of over three years at the Lyric Theatre, Shaftesbury Avenue, London, but failed to impress critics and the audience on Broadway, New York, where the production was pulled after only 29 performances.\n\nMessel created a desert island with lush, overgrown fruit and vegetation painted in strong colours and a makeshift hut set against a luminous blue sky.  The play ended with William Chappell descending the palm tree dressed as a monkey.",

It was also performed at the Coronet Theatre, New York on 7 October 1953.   Roger Pinkham has said of this production \u201cThe set of <i>The Little Hut</i>, exotically fruited, and ideally over-run with vegetation, made an ideal and highly praised setting for the slender story of husband, wife and lover wrecked on a desert island.\" (Pinkham, ed., 1983). \nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's theatre designs and other designs and artefacts.  The designs were briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being housed at the V&A from 1981 on indefinite loan.  The V&A Theatre Museum purchased the Oliver Messel collection from Lord Snowdon in 2005.",
