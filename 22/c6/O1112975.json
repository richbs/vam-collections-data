This poster was produced by Dewynters PLC which produces a large percentage of  the publicity for West End productions, and aims to produce original and innovative posters which capture the attention of their intended audience. In many cases the images, or part of the images, are intended to act as an instant reminder of the production to people seeing the posters briefly, for example, when they are pasted on buses. Examples of this 'logo' approach to poster design are the eyes that featured in posters for  Cats or the mask on the poster for  The Phantom of the Opera.",
