Glass negatives -\nrather than earlier paper ones - attained a level of detail previously unseen. However, the choice of lenses was still limited, negatives were sensitive to a relatively narrow tonal range and over-sensitive to the colour blue. Consequently, many architectural photographers excluded a building's setting, such as the sky or surrounding constructions. The resulting concentration upon details, as in this image, was often both an aesthetic choice and a matter of technical necessity.",
