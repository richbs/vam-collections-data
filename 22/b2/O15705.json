This is India's largest mosque, designed by the architect of Shah Jahan and built between 1644 and 1656. It was originally called Masjid-i Jahannuma ('mosque commanding a view of the world') and stands on Bho Jhala, one of Shahjahanabad's two hills, looking east towards the Red Fort.\n\n'Company paintings' were produced by Indian artists for Europeans living and working in the Indian subcontinent, especially British employees of the East India Company. They represent a fusion of traditional Indian artistic styles with conventions and technical features borrowed from western art. Some Company paintings were specially commissioned, while others were virtually mass-produced and could be purchased in bazaars.",
