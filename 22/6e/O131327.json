Studied at Manchester School of Design and with George Wallis, and moved with her sister to London 1854, where they lived together until 1885. Exhibited 48 fruit and flower pieces at the RA between 1851 and 1882, six at the BI 1855-59, and also at the Royal Manchester Institution. Died Brighton, Sussex, 28 September 1893. Ruskin admired the work of both sisters, although he wanted them to paint flowers naturally growing; in his Academy Notes of 1855, he wrote that Annie's paintings were 'remarkable for very lovely, pure, and yet unobtrusive colour - perfectly tender, and yet luscious ... I wish this very accomplished artist would paint some banks of flowers in wild country, just as they grow, as she appears slightly in danger of falling into too artificial methods of grouping'. \nLIT: \tAthenaeum 7 October 1893, p496 (obit); The Times 10 October 1893, p9 (obit); P Gerrish Nunn Victorian Women Artists 1987, p125 etc \n\nGroup of Cactus \n29-1884 \nCanvas, 31. 7 X 24.7 cm (12 \u00bd \u00d7 9 \u00be ins) Signed and dated 'AF [in monogram] M/68' bl \nPurchased 1884 \nAnnie Mutrie exhibited two paintings of cactus: 'Cactus, etc' at the BI in 1857 (295), and 'White Cactus' at the RA in 1872 (119).\n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
