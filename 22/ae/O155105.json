With Ron O'Donnell, he held a successful exhibition at the Photographers' Gallery, London, in 1886, called 'Constructed Narratives', which continued themes from his RCA graduation show.  This photograph was displayed in 'The 85 Show', an exhibition at the Serpentine Gallery of a selection of work by that year's London art college graduates.  In this exhibition Colvin represented the Royal College of Art with four of his constructed photographs, in which he combined his sculptural and photographic sensibilities.",
