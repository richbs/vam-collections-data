Chantrey exhibited seven busts of male sitters at the Royal Academy in 1817, including one of 'S.Shore, Esq.' Chantrey's ledgers record that on 30 November 1816 an order was raised by Samuel Shore Esq. of Norton, Derbyshire, commissioning Chantrey to execute a bust of himself in marble, for which he was charged 84, the approporiate price for a bust of this type. But on the other hand a letter from Ward dated 11 July 1814 records that Chantrey was to come to Sheffield that summer and \"model a bust of Mr Shore\", well before an order was formally recorded in the Ledger.\n\nSir Francis Legatt Chantrey (1781-1842) was an English sculptor, painter, and patron. He was probably the most successful portrait sculptor of his day. Together with Flaxman Chantrey can be ranked as England's greatest sculptor engaging in portrait busts and statues.",
