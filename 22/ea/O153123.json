There is a floral spray by the base of each boteh.  Each of these wide stripes is separated by a red or dark blue narrow stripe decorated with a single flower head arranged in offset rows.\nWarp: white, red, yellow and dark blue wool\nWeft: red, light red, yellow and white, all S-twist wool,  pink, green, dark blue, blue and brown wool.\nThere are two white selvedges but it has been cut and rejoined along a blue stripe.\nDespite initial impressions the fringe has been added along the top and bottom; it matches the stripes so exactly that it surely must have been produced in the same workshop.  for similar effect see T.192-1921.  Perhaps it was a tidy way to create a fabric of the required length or perhaps there was a technical reason with this to do with tension.",
