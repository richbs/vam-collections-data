The engineer Paul Riquet is suggested as the subject of the second portrait relief. \n\nThe sketch would seem to be intended for the base of a fountain or monument commemorating some such incident as that put forward. As yet, however, no corroborative evidence has been obtained nor has the signature at the back been identified.",
