            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nPattern boards were either used in workshops to guide painters and carvers or in shops or warehouses, to allow clients to choose details of a pattern. This board shows two colourways on the two sides, with slight variations in the design. The design, with the Prince of Wales' feathers and drapery, is thought to have originated in about 1787, when the then Prince of  Wales took on the powers of regent, at a time when his father, George III, was suffering a temporary bout of insanity, as a result of the illness porphyria.  The design became very popular and was published in a design book as late as 1802. \n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe board depicts the back of a chair, decorated with the Prince of Wales feathers, laurel leaves and berries. It is similar to a design of about 1788 by the prolific Lancaster firm of Gillow & Co. \n\nTime \nFrom about 1770, painted furniture was widely used, particularly in bedchambers and dressing rooms. Painted Adam-style designs became popular and the Prince of Wales feathers became a common motif after Prince George (later George IV) came of age in 1783. \n\nMaterials & Making \nThe board is a panel of pine made up from two vertically grained planks of unequal size. It has two crossed battens, a backplate, two rings and steel spring at the back. These allow the panel to be mounted and adjusted by the user.",
