The costume on the left consists of a high-waisted scarlet dress with short sleeves worn over a grey and brown striped underdress with long sleeves.  The figure also wears a wimple, a heart-shaped hat, with veil, and a pair of spectacles.  The figure on the right wears a volumminous white cape and a face mask with devil horns.  She carries a broomstick in her left hand.  To the right of the figure is a pencil and ink drawing of the same costume.  Unsigned by the artist.  On the reverse is a pencil drawing of a large male figure wearing Medieval style costume, possibly depicting Sir John Falstaff.",
