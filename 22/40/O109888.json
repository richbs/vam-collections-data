The great impresario, Serge Diaghilev, was famous for using painters to design productions for his ballet company, although many, like Matisse had never designed for the stage before.  \nMatisse's spare style and subtle use of colour proved ideal for the ballet.  Taking original Chinese sources, he has reduced the warrior style to its basic elements, using a subtle mix of brown, blue and white.  \nAlthough the design originates with Matisse, the realisation lies with the costumier, often in consultation with the designer, who may, or may not have experience of fabrics, trims and making techniques.  Thus the choice of fabrics - the use of brown and white felt, gold braid and blue silk for the skirt and sleeves - were most likely not suggested by the artist but by the theatrical costume maker, who would have the greater experience of what fabrics and decorative techniques would work on stage.",
