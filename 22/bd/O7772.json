It was always intended to be an exhibition piece.  Alexander Fisher (1864-1936) first showed this sconce, which he designed and made, at the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society in 1899 and again at the International Exhibition of Modern Decorative Art in Turin, Italy, in 1902.\n\nMaterials & Making\nAlexander Fisher initially trained as a silversmith at the South Kensington Schools, London (now the Royal College of Art), between 1881 and 1884.  Fired with an interest in enamelling by the French enameller Louis Dalpayrat, he went to Paris to study this art. Fisher mastered many different enamelling techniques and made specimen pieces demonstrating his mastery of them. In 1896 he wrote, 'The varieties of enamelling known as champlev\u00e9, cloisonn\u00e9, basse taille, plique-\u00e0-jour and Limoges painting, I have mastered in turn...all these methods were used formerly before the present revival; but they were not so completely understood or carried so far as they are today, nor were the whole methods practised by any artist as they are now'.\n\nPeople\nFisher was an influential teacher. His pupils mainly followed his painting technique, working with translucent colours over silver or copper covered with foils. Their compositions were based on a central figure and a specific theme.  Among his students were Nelson Dawson (1859-1942), Ernestine Mills and Lady Carmichael (who taught Phoebe Anna Traquair (1852-1936), whose work is featured in the 'Scottish School' display in the British Galleries).",
