In 1877 the authors of the first comprehensive manual of stage make-up entitled How to Make-Up. A Practical Guide to the Art of Making Up, for Amateurs etc. were given as: 'Haresfoot and Rouge'. \n\nIn The Road to the Stage (1827), the earliest account of the use of make-up in the English theatre, its author Leman Thomas Rede describes how to apply pigment on the face over a greasy base, and then: 'touch the cheek with a little hair powder, which will set the colour, and then lay on the verlimion and carmine. A rabbit's foot is better than anything else for distributing the paint equally.' Today the hare or rabbit's foot has been replaced by brushes.",
