His style of work was most similar to his brother S. R. Percy, with whom he went to live after their father's death in 1855.  The two brothers travelled together to Scotland in the 1850's and both were influenced by the areas they visited.  Both brothers had a love of the Snowdonia area of North Wales.  \n\nAlfred Walter's landscapes often incorporated scenes of seasonal outdoor life, including autumn and harvest scenes. This particular example shows the cutting and stacking of corn beneath a characteristic brooding sky.",
