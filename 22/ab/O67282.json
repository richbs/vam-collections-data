Evidence of what may be original plain weave in lower right hand corner, max. 42\" (11.5 cms) in length.  This is made up of a band of plain weave with white weft below and band of plain weave with brown weft. Both bands contain a line of weft twining, the lower in red and blue, the upper in white and pink. The warp threads have been knotted to form a fringe.  There are 4 shoots of orange weft immediately before the pile begins. Upper: cut but there remains 1\" (3 cms) of plain weave with warp threads grouped in threes and with thick brown woollen weft (perhaps this is a later repair). \n\nDESIGN: Field: dark red ground divided into 4 parts by a horizontal panel and 2 upright arch-shaped panels. The horizontal panel has 2 bands of crossed trefoils and each upright has a row of stylized drooping plants and is outlined by white S-motifs.  The field has 4 rows of stylized tendrils with a row of white X-motifs with yellow bars at the top and above and below the central panel. \nMain border: Dark red ground with drooping plants outlined in dark blue and dark green. \nInner border: Not at the bottom. Dark red ground with angular meander enclosing dark blue vertical bars.  Vertical bars only at the top.\n\nInnermost border: Not at the bottom. Dark red ground with stylised tulip heads in predominantly white and yellow.\n\nOuter border: Not at the bottom. Dark brown ground with a row of red crosses within a pair of white brackets, each cross separated by a chequered bar. \n\nOutermost border:  A twisted ribbon effect created by diamonds, predominantly dark red, appearing as paired triangles at the top and bottom (incomplete)\nElem: dark brown ground with 2 bands of stylized plants with pendent blossoms in dark red and orange outline with pink decoration. \n\nUpper panel: below the border with bracketted crosses, there is a band of 42 linked and horned white arches.  Within are two, and between are 4, dark red and dark blue quartered small rectangles inside a white diamond.\n\nDate Catalogued: 09/04/1996",

The arch is usually taken to represent the mihrab or decorative panel in the wall of a  mosque which indicates the direction of Mecca. The important thing to note about this carpet, which was probably woven by the Saryk tribal group, is that much of the lower end has been rewoven and patched.  The white pile is cotton; the rest is wool. Cotton gives a purer white than wool, which tends to be creamy in colour.",
