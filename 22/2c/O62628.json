The mouth of the vessel narrows to two, diametrically opposite V shaped points, the culmination of two arced channels down each side of the body which form the two spouts.  The vessel is stabilised by a cast and polished aluminium handle in the form of a rod, oval in cross section which rises in an arc from the floor and curves away from the vertical, passing through the body, just beneath the rim and tapering to a point as it emerges on the opposite side. The handle is secured by a rivet which is attached to an internal lug, immediately on the inside of the rim.  The lid, anodised a rich purple, is slightly concave in cross section and elliptical in outline to follow the rim of the body.  The points end in semicircular cut out to allow for the flow of liquid.  The handle for the lid is an inverted U shaped section of polished aluminium, attached through the centre of the lid by two rivets from the underside, each in a rubber sleeve which grip the handle when closed.  The section of the handle which passes through the body serves as a support for the detachable lid.  At the mid point there are two notches, each on either side which serve to locate the rubber sleeves.",

Robert Foster (b.1962), one of Australia\u2019s leading metalsmiths, designed and made it. \n\nFoster is one of the Australian designers who have increasingly gained international recognition over the past 25 years.
