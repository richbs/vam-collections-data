            "public_access_description": "This design is for an enamelled and jewelled scent-bottle and was possibly drawn by Jean Ducrollay (1710-1787) about 1760. It is from an album of designs which date from about 1735-1820 and includes those for snuff boxes, scent holders, watches and watch cases, spoons, fans and fan mounts, small swords, and chatelaines (ornamental chains, pins, or clasps usually worn at a woman's waist, to which trinkets, keys, purses, or other articles are attached).  The scent bottle was intended for an elite client possibly associated with the Court.  Scent bottles were breathtakingly expensive.  Lazare Duvaux, the marchand-bijoutier, or jeweller, to Louis XV noted the scent bottles that he sold on a daily basis and to which client.  He sold Louis XV 'four crystal bottles with different perfumes, 266L'.  They therefore cost 266 livres over half the entire wealth of a lower class family whose money totalled 500 livres.\n\nThere is a close relationship between the contents of the album and known work by three Parisian goldsmiths, Jean Ducrollay (1710-1787), Pierre- Fran\u00e7ois Drais (active 1761-1788), and Charles Ouizille (1744-1830) whose names appear on the first page of the album. This suggests that all the designs emanate from their workshops.  Drais worked for the Court at Versailles as jeweller to both King Louis XV and Louis XVI. Ouizille worked in this capacity for Louis XVI. Most of the material dates from the period 1755-90.",
