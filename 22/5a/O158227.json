Phil May (1864-1903) was an artist who became a regular member of the staff of the magazine Punch in 1896 and whose work was characterised  by a sense of wit and an economy of line.\n\nDan Leno was a star of the music halls in the 1880s who became known as the 'Funniest Man on Earth'. Born George Galvin in London, the son of music hall performers, he started his career as a child performer, appearing with his brother and his uncle Johnny Danvers, dancing in public houses all over England. By the age of 18 Dan was a champion clog-dancer and was engaged by George Conquest with Danvers for pantomime at London's Surrey Theatre. In 1889 he went to Drury Lane Theatre where he excelled as pantomime Dame, returning for several years as Sister Anne, and Widow Twankey.",
