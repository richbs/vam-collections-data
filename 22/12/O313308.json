            "public_access_description": "This is a bronze group designed by Alessandro Algardi (1595-1654), in the first quarter of the 17th century.\nAlessandro Algardi (1595-1654) was an Italian sculptor, architect and draughtsman. Alongside Bernini he was the most important sculptor in Rome active around the middle of the 17th century. He produced the classizing antithesis to Bernini's High Baroque sculpture. They were seen and experienced at the time as rivals and equals.\nThe subject of St Michael overcoming Satan was quite popular in the Counter-Reformation time in Italy, allowing the Catholic Church to associate the theme with their 'battle' over the Protestants.\nThe archangel Michael is the first of the angels. He is often represented in armour with a sword and standing over or fighting with a dragon or he is shown with scales. God sent him to overcome Lucifer and he is also regarded as the angel of the Resurrection. He would receive the souls of the dead weighing them in his balance.",
