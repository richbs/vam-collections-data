It demonstrates the superb quality of realistic painting achieved by the S\u00e8vres factory, near Paris, at this date.  It was made as part of a grand service in which probably every plate had a different design.  This is of Chinese asters, named as such on the reverse ('Ast\u00e8re de la Chine').  The wealth of colour, the length of time needed to paint this elaborate decoration, the gilding and the fact that it was made by the S\u00e8vres factory, which  in the 1840s was again under royal patronage, would  all have combined to make this an extremely expensive plate.  It is marked for King Louis Philippe.\n\nTime \nThe fortunes of the S\u00e8vres factory were always closely tied to political events. The factory  was originally established under royal patronage; after the French Revolution Napoleon awarded it state subsidies and  from 1806 he took it under imperial patronage. These subsidies and, after Napoleon's overthrow,  the support of the restored Bourbon monarchy continued until 1848, when the factory came under the control of the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce.  In 1851, as the State Manufactory, S\u00e8vres was keen to reaffirm its technical and artistic superiority.",
