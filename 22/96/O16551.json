            "bibliography": "Parkinson, R., Victoria and Albert Museum, <u>Catalogue of British Oil Paintings 1820-1860</u>, London: HMSO, 1990, p. 54\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\"CRESWICK, Thomas, RA (1811-1869)\n\nBorn Sheffield 5 February 1811; educated at Hazelwood, near Birmingham. Studied art with the landscape painter John Vincent Barber in Birmingham, and settled in London 1828. Exhibited 139 works at the RA between 1828 and 1870, 80 at the BI 1828-55, and 46 at the SBA 1829-38. Early landscapes were principally in Wales, Yorkshire and Cornwall, then Ireland (after a visit in 1837), and coastal scenes after 1848. An early member of the Etching Club, many of his works were engraved. Commissioned 1851 to paint an extensive series of views in north Wales. Elected ARA 1842, RA 1851. Admired particularly in the later 1840s and 1850s for his truth to nature and the charm of his compositions; later works were criticised for being too dark and brown in tone. Occasionally worked in collaboration with other artists such as Richard Ansdell and W P Frith. Died Bayswater, London, 28 December 1869; his studio sale was at Christie's 6-7 May 1870. The <i>Illustrated London News</i> obituarist wrote that his life and work were 'comparatively monotonous and devoid of incident'. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1856, pp141-4, 1870, p53 (obit); <i>The Graphic</i> 8 January 1870, pp121-2 (obit with engr portrait); <i>Illustrated London News</i> 8 January 1870, p53 (obit with engr portrait); C Collins Baker 'Thomas Creswick RA and Mid-Victorian Landscape Painters' <i>Art Journal</i> 1908, pp104-7 \n\n<b>Land's End, Cornwall</b> \n232-1890 \nCanvas, 92.1 x 130.2 cm (36\u00bc x 51\u00bc ins) \nSigned and dated '1842' indistinctly on rock bl \nBequeathed by Miss Eleanor Robinson 1890 \n\nExhibited at the BI in 1843 as 'Rocks at the Land's End'. The <i>Athenaeum</i> critic wrote that it depicted 'the last bleak rocks of England, and, beyond, an all but illimitable horizon of rippling green waters, suggesting the power and vastness of Nature's barrier ... We have not often seen a more poetical picture ... ' The <i>Art Union</i>, however, thought 'parts of this production are very like nature, but, as a whole, it is the least interesting of all the accomplished painter's works. The sea does not to our minds look like sea'. When Collins Baker saw it at the V&A in 1908, he called it 'as conscientiously dull a seascape as any in that gallery. It is painted with extraordinary mechanical tightness, from inch to inch'. Spectators today find more to admire in the work; the handling is not as tight as Collins Baker believed, and the viewpoint of the scene is unusually powerful for a painting of its date. \n\nEXH: BI 1843 (387); <i>Bicentenary exhibition</i> 1768-1968 RA 1968 (215) \n\nLIT: <i>Athenaeum</i> 18 February 1843, p165; <i>Art Union</i> 1843, p69;<i>Collins Baker</i>, p106; G Reynolds <i>Victorian Painting</i> 1966, p175 (repr pl 101)\"",

Across the waters of the Atlantic Ocean lie the United States of America.  While the subject is rich in Romantic overtones, the handling of pigment is meticulously used to render the textures of the water and the rocks, and later in the nineteenth century, in the age of Impressionism, commentators found this tightness too mechanical for their taste.  In recent years, the painting has retrieved its status as one of the great landscapes of the last century.  Of particular interest is the unusually elevated viewpoint Creswick has chosen, which invests the scene from the outset with an astonishing power. A quietly distinguished artist, Creswick is seen here in the 1840s at the height of his powers, and indeed he won the annual British Institution prize for this picture when it was exhibited in 1843.",
