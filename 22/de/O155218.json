The ground is a blue ribbed silk. In the lower half there are fine gold vertical lines from the hem forming a zigzag.  In the upper half gold metal thread forms three downward pointing triangles separated by a red, blue and gold band from which fine gold lines extend down. The central triangle is narrower than the other 2 and the solid diagonal sides break into extended gold 'fingers'.  At a certain length these half in thickness, becoming fine lines with thicker 'slubs'; each ends with a 'slub' and together then form a point.  The edges of the two wider panels break into thicker and thinner 'fingers', their 'slubs' creating an almost solid band.  Some lines extend to form a slightly serrated outline and the central ones continue as solid lines down to the horizontal seam. There is a red, blue and gold band to the outer side of the 3 gold panels, each has a single gold line extending from it.  There are several isolated gold lines and another red one toward the side of the garment.",
