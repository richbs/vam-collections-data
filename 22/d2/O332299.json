Vand (Danish) is water = aqua and dal (Danish) is vallery = vallis; Rip. is abbreviation for Ripensis; for Wandal was born at Ribe in Denmark. The young man went abroad (1607-14) to Strasburg and Switzerland); in 1609 he was in Strasburg and received there the title of Magister. Therefore I think the panel of 1609 was made by Bartholomaus Lingg II in Strasburg who was a friend of Christopher Murer of Zurich. The style is the same.",
