This print comes from a recent (and ongoing) series of solar plate etchings in which the imagery is based on lace-work but the 'stitches' are letters from phrases taken from the diaries of the artist's aunt Clarice Spratling. Clarice was a young VAD nurse posted to France in 1915. Her diary includes shocking injuries and the distress of wounded and gassed men in plain unemotional observations. This particular print derives its pattern from the repeated words 'Amputations etc', which have been reversed and overlaid, but can also be read entire in places. The series as whole addresses themes of propaganda and deception, memory and recollection, and the ways in which shocking and traumatic events can be accommodated by individuals and society, and subsumed in social rituals. Whilst working on these prints Cole visited the V&A to see how lace was exhibited in the galleries, and this led to her decision to print in white on black paper.\n\nThe print process used by cole for these prints is solar etching - a process which, unlike conventional etching, uses no acid or other corrosive chemicals but instead involves exposing a coated plate to sunlight.",
