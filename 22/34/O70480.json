            "public_access_description": "With its exploitation of chance effects, rough textures, controlled irregularity and emphatic celebration of the potter's touch, this jar is characteristic of a strand in Japanese ceramics particularly associated with the tea ceremony, for use in which it was intended.\n\nThe jar was acquired, like many of the V&A's best tea ceramics, from the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition of 1876. The previous year the South Kensington Museum (now the V&A) had paid \u00a31,000 to the Exposition's Japanese commissioners to make a selection of ceramics 'to give fully the history of the art.' At nine shillings (45p), this jar was relatively inexpensive, reflecting the low value attached to historical tea wares at a time of extreme adulation of the West. The importance of such pieces in the Japanese ceramic canon has long since been recognised, however, and this jar now ranks as one of the cornerstones of the V&A's Japanese collection.\n\nThe jar was made in Bizen, one of the first areas to make purpose-made tea wares in the late sixteenth century. Prior to that, ceramics from China, Korea and South-East Asia had been prized, as had some native Japanese ceramics. The latter included earlier Bizen and Shigaraki wares originally made for alternative purposes but adopted by tea afici0nados for tea ceremony use. This jar would have been used to contain cold water, which was used to top up water heated in a cast-iron kettle. Powerfully sculpted, it embodies both the taste for the simple and restrained characteristic of the 'wabi' tea aesthetic championed by the tea master Sen no Rikyu (1522-1591) and the taste for the bold and exuberant characteristic of Furuta Oribe (1544-1615), a follower of Rikyu who succeeded his teacher as leading tea master of the day and was particularly active in commissioning tea wares from different Japanese kilns.",

ISBN 1851773088.\nDuring the 1870s the Museum expanded its holdings of Japanese ceramics, both historical and contemporary. While this acquisition policy reflected contemporary consumer demand for Japanese objects, it was also an attempt to establish a complete taxonomy and thus understanding of Japanese arts.\nThis heavily sculpted jar, along with a teabowl and incense burner (cats. 115-116), were displayed with a large group of Japanese ceramics at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition of 1876. The jar was made at Bizen, one of the first Japanese kiln groups to produce purpose-made tea ceramics during the late sixteenth century. The deposits of melted ash that enhance the powerfully organic form result from firing in a wood-fired kiln. The jar was used as a container from which cold water was ladled into a cast-iron kettle.\nThe Philadelphia Centennial Exposition was the first major exhibition of its kind to be mounted in America. Japan was the largest overseas contributor after Britain. Even before the exhibition opened, however, the Museum had already purchased one section of the display of Japanese ceramics. In 1875-in anticipation of the Philadelphia show-Philip Cunliffe Owen paid \u00a31,000 to the Exposition's Japanese commissioners to \"make an historical collection of porcelain and pottery from the earliest period until the present time, to be formed in such a way as to give fully the history of the art.\" At Philadelphia this group was labelled \"The Property of the South Kensington Museum.\" This acquisition strategy enabled Britain to assert cultural hegemony over Japan, ahead of America, its rival for power in the East.\nDespite Cunliffe Owen's intention, the collection was uneven in its coverage. Many objects, including the most costly, were contemporary products of the type that the Japanese were promoting for export to the West. The collection did, however, include some important sixteenth- and seventeenth-century tea ceramics.\nThe Philadelphia group was in London by the following year, where it was displayed prominently in the Museum's South Court and was featured in subsequent Museum guides, although the tea ceremony ceramics were not specifically singled out. It was not until after World War II that the Museum realised that, for the mere nine shillings paid for this fresh-water jar, it had acquired what is now considered one of the most important objects in the Japanese collection.\n\nLit.
