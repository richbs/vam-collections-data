The work is also named at the end as the Trailokya dipi, which is more usually applied to the Sangrahani Sutra of Jinabhadragani Kshamashramana, the earliest work of this class. The work is accompanied by an interlinear text in smaller devanagari script, which is possibly the commentary of Devabhadra. This manuscript is written on 56 oblong folios of paper of which two folios (10a and 12a) are not numbered, the last numbered folio being 54. The outer folios are of double thickness and decorated with a central ogee medallion and floral motifs on their outer faces. The copy is undated but appears to have been written and illustrated in Western India during the 18th century.\nThis folio (14) verso is illustrated with a cosmic chart showing the planetary bodies.",

The manuscript, made in the eighteenth century, includes illustrations and cosmic diagrams.\nThis folio has two small cosmic and stellar diagrams on the recto. On the verso is one half of a cosmic chart showing the dvipas, or continents. The other half of the chart is on the next folio (IS.35:15-1971). There are believed to be two and a half continents, arranged concentrically and separated by two ring-shaped oceans. Rivers can be seen flowing into the oceans and mountain ranges appear as lines on the diagram. At the centre is Mount Meru, the cosmic axis, depicted here in yellow. The part of the universe shown here, which is that inhabited by humans, is imagined as being in the centre of the universe, below the heavens and above the hells.",
