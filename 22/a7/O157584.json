The curtains are likely to have been used at Belhus until the 1920s, when they were probably taken to the 3rd baronet's estate in Norfolk. They were inherited by Mrs John Pollock, daughter of Sir Richard Barrett-Lennard, 5th Bt. (1898-1977). This provenance is consistent with their design and technique, as they are probably of French manufacture, and may have been acquired by Sir Edward Barrett during his travel or residence in France. Their technique of embroidery and appliqu\u00e9 on a wool ground is an extremely rare survival from this date in more than the most fragmentary form, because of its vulnerability, and has almost no representation in our collection, so the acquisition of a set of bed hangings is significant for us.",
