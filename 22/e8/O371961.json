Originally it seems to have had a central, flat, low stretcher (now missing, but the tenons visible in the side stretchers.) The four turned feet of inverted cup form are all replacements.\n\nThe top, with moulded edge, consists of three butted boards and is pegged and nailed to the frame of joined construction with full height legs. The stretchers are tenoned and pegged to the legs. The single drawer is of oak, the sides dovetailed to the front, and the back nailed to the sides, with bottom boards (restored) nailed up to the back and sides. The drawer front is chip-carved with lunettes, and has two turned knob handles and a lock (probably 19th century). The drawer is supported on two grooves in the sides that slide on battens fitted inside the table frame. The side rails and back of the table are tenoned and pegged to the legs, and are cut with a simple bevelled moulding. Below the drawer is a narrow rail tenoned to the legs.",
