The Princess lives in a castle and is eventually freed by the soldier who owns the tinderbox.  Its designer Adam Kilian (b.1923), is a stage designer, printmaker and illustrator who trained as an architect in Nottingham (1945-1948) before returning to Poland to study stage design at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw.  In 1949 he began working with the Idle Dreams puppet theatre in Warsaw, which was renamed Teatr Lalka in 1951.  In the 1950s he worked on many important productions there with the puppet theatre director Jan Wilkowski, and he has been associated withthge theatre for over 50 years.\n\nAdam Kilian has a great interest in Polish folk art and bright colour. This Princess is very simple yet wonderfully demure and expressive, and as a type of glove puppet belongs to the style of  European puppet theatre that developed in the mid- 20th century which has the puppeteers in full viewof the audience, their puppets held in front of them.",
