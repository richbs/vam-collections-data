Part of the collar is of grey silk velvet, the revers are short and narrow with one button hole. The sleeves have cuffs which curve away from the waist slit that has four buttons and button hole. The cuff is also trimmed with matching grey silk velvet. There are three open slit pockets with welted edges two on the right front skirt below the waist seam and one on the left. Two of the pocket bags are of cream felted cotton. The shoulders are almost natural with very small pads. The coat is lined throughout in plain grey silk with linings of grey satin for facings at the front and for the cuffs. There are two inside breast pockets, one on each side. \n\nThe back has a waist seam and centre back seam and a single vent that reaches half way up the C/B skirt. There are also left and right back seams above the waist allowing for left and right backs and sides. These seams also match the side seams of the left and right front skirt panels each of which are cut in one large piece.\n\nThe tailor's label of white silk ribbon with black wording is stitched to the inside right breast pocket.",
