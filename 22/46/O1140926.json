            "public_access_description": "This design for a bracelet by Charlotte Isabella Newman is from an album of designs produced for the firm of John Brogden (1864-1884). This album contains 1,593 designs for jewellery and goldsmith's work, mainly in colour and dating between 1848 and 1884.  \nThis design shows the head of Medusa from Greek mythology. The Medusa was one of three female entities, with snakes for hair, who were known as Gorgons whose looks turned the beholder to stone. Such a design demonstrates the resourcefulness which made Newman indispensable to Brogden. Newman's use of different styles led to her becoming the first woman artist-jeweller in Victorian London.  Newman trained at the Government Art School in South Kensington before joining the Brogden firm as a designer, probably in the mid-1860s.\n\nThe firm was founded by John Brogden the elder in about 1796.\nFrom about 1824 to 1831 it was styled 'Brogden & Garland' and thereafter until 1841 'Garland & Watherston'. The younger Brogden, the son of Thomas Brogden and presumably a relative of the founder, served an apprenticeship to J.W. Garland as a goldsmith and jeweller from 1834 to 1841. Following Garland's departure, the remaining partner, J. H. Watherston, removed the firm to new premises at the 16 Henrietta Street, Covent Garden and in 1848 joined forces with the younger Brogden.",
