In the centre of the cover is a circular medallion consisting of a formal rosette surrounded by interlacing bands of strapwork and flowers with an elaborate scalloped border. In each corner is a quadrant motif with the same pattern. The rest of the ground is occupied by three bands of interlacing strapwork entwined with exotic flowers and leaves.\n\nA border is around the main part of the quilt of scrolls and scallops with flowers and leaves arranged along a straight band.\n\nOn each side of the main area of the quilt is a border with a similar scroll and scallop pattern. One of these borders is wider than the other and is decorated with flowers and leaves with a formal rosette pattern surrounded by strapwork and a  scallop border in a rectangle in the centre. Along one of the short sides of this rectangle and towards the two ends of this wider border are worked a series of buttonholes. The entire cover is quilted in back stitch in a series of diamonds worked in concentric lines with circular rosettes at the corners. The borders are lined on three sides with striped silk in two shades of yellow.",
