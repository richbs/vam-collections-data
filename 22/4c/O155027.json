It is typical Georgiadis in both its  architectural feeling (he originally trained as an architect) and severe geometric decoration.  While the cloaks and tunics could be adapted to several contexts, the characteristic nemes headcloth firm sets the period as Egyptian.     \nGeorgiadis was famous for his expensive designs.  The costumes were built up of layers of appliqu\u00e9, which created an impression of luxury and sumptuousness.  The 'riot' of geometric shapes are held in check by the subdued colours, the dull green and browns, highlighted by gold and bronze, suggesting strength and masculinity.  \nGeorgiadis's influence on stage design in the mid 20th century was immense and few designers who passed through his stage design classes at the Slade School escaped untouched.",
