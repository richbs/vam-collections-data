For the former, wooden clamps with mirror-image carved designs are tied either side of folded cloth or paper, to exert great pressure, and then the clamped cloth is submerged in the dye. The parts of the fabric that are highly pressurized resist dye. \n\nPeter Ford  has used a modified process in which paper is folded many t imes before tying and dipping. The most difficult part of the process is untying the tightly folded  bundle while still wet, as the paper fibre is very fragile at this stage, but  the paper must be opened up and spread flat while still wet, because the inks become adhesive as the paper dries out.",
