According to Greek legend about the birth of the goddess, Venus arose from the foam of the sea shore. She is depicted here accompanied by two Tritons or sea-gods, merman creatures with the torsos of men and the tails of fish who usually formed the escort of marine divinities. The evening also appears to have featured another tableau based on Vesuvius, the volcano on the Bay of Naples which erupted eight times during the 19th century.\n\nSince this evening is advertised as: 'the Benefit of Mr. Danson', he would have received a portion of the evening's takings, since theatrical Benefits were a way of providing occasional extra income to cast and staff involved in a production.",
