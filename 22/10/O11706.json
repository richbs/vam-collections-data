The function of the set was to rinse glasses and cool wine bottles. In the 18th century wine glasses were not set on the table, but brought to each diner by a servant; when empty, the glass was removed for washing and refilling. The glass was rinsed with water from the fountain, the dirty water discarded into the cistern, and the glass refilled from the wine bottles chilling in the cooler. The set would have been arranged in tiers on a sideboard in the dining room but the large and heavy cooler was generally placed on the floor.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe body of this cistern is ornamented with a band of strapwork and shells on the upper part, and gadrooning on the lower. The gadrooning at foot and rim is offset by the bold upward-scrolled handles supported on brackets. The handles are purely decorative, intended for display.\n\nOwnership & Use\nOnly the extremely wealthy could afford a matching wine set of such magnificence. With its elaborate flowing curves and massive sculptural decoration, the set is designed to be seen as a unit and create a strong visual impact.",
