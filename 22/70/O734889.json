            "historical_context_note": "The drawing is laid down on the same sheet as E.535-1937 and 536-1937; the sheet is inscribed <i>12</i> in brown ink on the top right corner, suggesting that it was originally part of an album subsequently dismantled and which could have enclosed drawings of similar characteristics. \n\nOriginally acquired as an anonymous Italian design from the late 16th century, this drawing was subsequently identified as a copy after Jacques Androuet Du Cerceau. In 1977, Janet Byrne identifies the sheet as a copy by Jacques Androuet du Cerceau of an ewer and a vase designed by Polidoro Caldara (thus identified on its mat by J. E Hayward in 1964) and painted by him on the facade of the Palazzo Milesi in Rome shortly before the sack of Rome. The Caldara vases were engraved many times over the next two hundred years before the frescoes finally disappeared: the earliest dated set is by Cherubino Alberti in 1582, and both the ewer and the vase were etched by Du Cerceau in his set of small vase.\n\nHowever Prof Dr Peter Fuhring has pointed out (written communication, April 2012) that this drawing is not by Jacques Androuet du Cerceau, though it has been attributed to him and occasionally published under his name. In fact the sheet was part of an album that is now dismantled and other sheets from it have appeared on the art market. A second group of copy drawings was executed in pen and brown ink, formerly in the Houthakker Collection in Amsterdam, but possibly from the same sketchbook as can be demonstrated by the stitching holes in the paper (see Fuhring 1989, under no. 560). All these drawings are copies in the same direction of the vases etched by Du Cerceau. No preparatory drawings have survived for any of the c. 1700 prints by Du Cerceau.",
