He travelled extensively in Germany, England, Italy and Holland, exhibited in Vienna and Munich between 1873 and 1883, and in the Royal Academy in London between 1880 and 1881. \n\nHeffner was one of the greatest exponents of the Munich School of Paintings led by A. Stademan and A. G. Lier who were his masters. This painting is part of group of six famous Italian views mounted together and depicts a seascape with sailing boats at Chioggia, ner Venice. Although his first trip to Italy is recorded in 1883, the present sketch is dated 1880. Following the Realist technique, this work was probably executed directly after the motif in open air. It work is a fine example of Heffner's mature manner, which became broader and sketchier over the years.",

It is a good example of the Realist movement that developed in the Germanic countries in the second half of the 19th century under the influence of French realism and the Barbizon school. This work was probably executed in open air, following the tradition of Realist paintings. \nThis work may have been painted directly for the English market as Heffner regularly supplied pictures to the English art dealer Thomas Wallis, whose business activities brought to Munich. Such pictures attracted patrons and collectors and hitherto a great extent of Heffner's oeuvre is to be found in private collections rather in public institutions. Heffner  executed another of famous views from Switzerland also owns by the museum (see 866A/E-1894).",
