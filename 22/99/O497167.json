As a charcoal fire container, a brazier was used not only to heat a place in winter, preserve embers, boil stew or tea, but also to heat irons when sewing and ironing. Being portable, it was used in every corner of the house. In the late Joseon period, more brass braziers were manufactured, and richly decorated braziers were widely used by the upper class. This brazier is made of nickel and of an antique-shape. Each side of the body is framed with a fret pattern band and is mainly decorated with bats, Chinese characters and a plantain-leaf pattern. The bottom is filled with small ring patterns. The legs are decorated with lotus-scroll designs. The lid has a lotus-shaped knob and features a flower and bird pattern in openwork design. Four nails used to connect the body and foot can be seen, and there are traces of prior use. The spatula is also made of nickel and has a rectangular head. The fire tongs are made of nickel and tied to a ring to be kept together.",
