On one side it shows a man with compasses, representing technology, and a woman with a palette, representing art, in front of a profile head of the personification of France, with a tricolour rosette in her hair. On the other side are two torches, a hammer and a winged caduceus wreathed with laurel. \n\nThe caduceus is a winged staff entwined with serpents, carried by Hermes, messenger of the gods, as a symbol of peace and harmony. Its use here, along with the laurel wreath symbolising Victory, torches for Fame and a hammer to represent Technology, is typical of the Art Deco period, where symbols from the classical world were often consciously incorporated into design.\nThe medallist Pierre Turin (1891-1968) attended the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris and studied under Vernon, Patey and Coutan, who were well-known sculptors. From 1911 Turin exhibited at the Salon des Artistes Fran\u00e7ais, and later also at the Salon of the Monnaie. In 1920 he won the Grand Prix de Rome and in 1925 he received a gold medal. Turin was made Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1936 and received the medal of honour at the Salon des Artistes Fran\u00e7ais. He was a member of the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Belgique.",
