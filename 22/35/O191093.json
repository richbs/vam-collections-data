The elections took place between the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and the reunification of East and West Germany.\n\nThe Alliance for Germany was an opposition coalition formed on the 5th of February 1990 in then West-Berlin to stand for the 'Volkskammer' (People's Chamber) election. It got the majority of the seats and thus formed the interim-government until reunification, with Lothar de Maizi\u00e8re as Minister President.\n\nThe CDU, DSU (German Social Union) and DA (Democratic Awakening) were part of the Alliance. The political aims (reunification of Germany and reconstitution of the federal states) were mainly determined from the West German side of the CDU. The then Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl appeared at many election campaign activities for the East German CDU.\n\nIn this poster the CDU-West clearly avows its connection to the CDU-East. CDU-West support was massive and it was frequently suggested that it was an illegitimate intervention. This is communicated through the words: 'Freunde helfen Freunden', which means 'Friends help Friends'. At the bottom there is the CDU logo with the words 'Die Zukunft' - 'The Future'.",
