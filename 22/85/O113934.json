The pale-faced emperor is carried by four bearers in a palanquin across a green hilly landscape. He is dressed all in white, except for a green and gold striped turban band and a gold patka. His bearers wear short red tunics. The emperor sits with hunched shoulders and his hands raised as if in prayer. His halo is a slightly darker shade of green than the background. Two attendants follow, bearing insignia of royalty in the form of a parasol and an <i>aftabgir</i>, or sunshade. They are also dressed in white. Walking at the emperor's side is a yellow-clad flywhisk bearer and another male, also in white. There is a Persian inscription in gold at the top of the painting giving the emperor's titles, the name of the artist and the date.",

He is dressed entirely in white with no jewellery, in keeping with the austerity that characterised his personality in later years. He sits with hunched shoulders and his hands raised as if in prayer. Two attends follow him, bearing a parasol and an aftabgir, or sunshade, both emblems of royalty. The dated Persian inscription in gold at the top of the painting gives the emperor's titles and the name of the artist, Ghulaman.",
