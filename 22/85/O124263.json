His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nChristopher Fry\u2019s verse play The Dark is Light Enough (1954) is set in the Countess Rosmarin Ostenburg\u2019s country house at the time of the Hungarian rebellion against the Austrians, 1848-1850.  The dying Countess with pacifist principles selflessly harbours Gettner, her former son-in-law and deserter from the Hungarian army.  The play received mixed reviews following its transference to Broadway, New York in 1955.  Critics praised the acting and sets but objected to the play\u2019s obscure meaning.\n\nA design for a chandelier in the Countess\u2019s home.  Fry later regretted Messel\u2019s opulent recreation of a Victorian drawing room.  The play \u2018needed only suggestion, rather than imaginative actuality; all that was required was a staircase and a window looking on to snow, the rest to be left to the words\u2019.
