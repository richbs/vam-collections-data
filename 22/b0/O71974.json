He also asked him to provide suitable pieces of furniture for it. The house, Snelston Hall in Derbyshire, has now been demolished.\n\nThis sofa is known as a vis-\u00e0-vis after a French phrase meaning \u2018face to face\u2019. It was a practical solution to the difficulty of talking to someone while sitting on the same piece of furniture. Cottingham called it a \u2018conversational sofa\u2019.\n\nCottingham had to create new forms for the furniture at Snelston Hall, because the furniture types that had actually existed in the Middle Ages were very different. Certainly there had been nothing like a European sofa, let alone a vis-\u00e0-vis. He used authentic Gothic details, which he had copied from the architecture of medieval castles and churches.",
