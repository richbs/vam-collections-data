The stories, from a long-established oral tradition, were written down in Persian, the language of the court, in multiple volumes. These originally had 1400 illustrations, of which fewer than 200 survive today. Work probably began in about 1562 and took 15 years to complete.\nThis very damaged page is said to depict Hamza, Landhaur, Umar Ma'dikarb and Sa'ad who die in battle at the Uhud Mountain near Medina, following which Hamza was buried by the Prophet himself.",
