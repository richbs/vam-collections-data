The panel is cut to cover the face of a horse from the forehead to the muzzle with top and bottom indentations to allow for bit and ears and with squared oval cut-outs for the eyes. Two leather thongs with metal buckles are attached at each of the sides to allow for tying to the head. The field of leather is covered with square metal plates with embossed domes at the centre of each; the corners of the plates are also protected with domed metal covers. A central metal reinforcing strip six centimetres wide and expanding into a circular plate on the forehead runs down the bridge of the nose. Attached to this element at the top and bottom are two trilobate pierced-work brass pendants which are hinged to the main spine. A pair of triangular openwork panels lie within the field of metal bosses on the outer sides of each eye-hole. Each is attached with four leather thongs. All the edges of the shaffron are bound with a stitched covering of shagreen.",
