He left Balenciaga, with whom he had worked for six years, to join Courr\u00e8ges in 1964. When this partnership failed, he began to design, independently showing his first collection in 1965. Like Courr\u00e8ges, Ungaro sculpted hard-edged clothes in heavy worsted fabrics and triple gaberdines. His garments retained the angular shapes of the mid 1960s fashions so perfectly that they often almost stood up by themselves.\n\nThis day dress and jacket was worn by Mrs Brenda Azario. It was featured in French Vogue (March 1966 and March 1967).",
