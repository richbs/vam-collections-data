This vase was made in the same factory, under the same industrial conditions.\n\nDesign & Designing\nWalter Crane (1845-1915) trained as a wood-engraver and worked as a painter and illustrator.  He designed tile patterns for Maw from 1874 and was commissioned to design a series of vases in about 1889. These demonstrate Crane's interest in all historical forms and decoration, especially those of classical antiquity and of the Islamic world.  This swan-shaped vase has powerfully-designed painted decoration with Neo-classical overtones typical of Crane's graphic work. His monogram is equally decorative, incorporating a standing crane. Crane also designed tiles and decorative wares for Pilkington and Wedgwood.",
