This poster, printed on 18 May 1968, at the beginning of the occupation of the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, depicts a policeman wielding a baton and carrying a riot shield bearing the letters 'SS'. In this way a comparison is drawn between members of the French CRS (Compagnies R\u00e9publicaines de Securit\u00e9) and the German Nazi Party's SS (Schutz-Staffel).",
