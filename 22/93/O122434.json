The wave patterns are curled up and spray patterns are made up of elongated leaves set against a ground of wickerwork. The rest of the dish is reserve-painted with a continuous leafy lotus scroll in the well. Six bracketed panels open toward the central flower with similar blooms inside them. Four elongated leafy S-stems with a central flower and small star dividers undulate on the outer well. This type of decoration is a regular feature on later dishes but is pained with less care. The exterior has a lose leaf and lotus flower decoration.",

Echoes of earlier traditions remained, in particular in the black-under-turquoise colour scheme that dates back in Iran to the end of the 12th century. Towards the end of the 16th century there was a widening of interest that blossomed in the 17th century to a wide range of styles and techniques in which blue and white plays a dominant but not exclusive role.",
