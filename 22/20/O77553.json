Early examples were open boat-shaped vessels with one or two pouring lips, but later ones were often tureen-shaped and supported on a central foot. Both types could require an under-dish to prevent spillage, and sauce tureens like this one usually had a matching ladle.\n\nUse\nThe five main sauces introduced by the French were b\u00e9chamel, brune/espagnol,tomate, mayonnaise and velout\u00e9. Gravies made from roasted meat juices flavoured with wine, citrus juice, capers, herbs and spices were also popular in 18th-century Britain. Other sauces had a 'roux' base, made by combining butter or lard with flour and broth or milk, and flavoured with parsley, onions, celery, anchovies, oysters, cockles or eggs. Butter sauces, served in smaller sauce boats or butter boats, frequently accompanied vegetables. A hot sauce of wine, butter and sugar was the most common one for puddings.\n\nTrading\nJosiah Wedgwood (1730-1795) sold his pottery through his London warehouse and from his Staffordshire factory site. He also sold large quantities of pottery to export merchants and agents abroad. In 1774 his creamware catalogue (which was available in both English and French versions) listed sauce boats of a different design at 2s each wholesale.",
