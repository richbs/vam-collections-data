It is possible that it was originally intended as a love gift because of the symbolism of the flowers depicted on the fan. In the Language of Flowers popular in the 19th Century violets stood for faithfulness and modesty. Lily of the valley is much used in bridal arrangements for their sweet perfume and is traditionally associated with May 1st, especially in France where it is handed out at special events.",
