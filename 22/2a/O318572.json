Flinders Petrie - often called the father of English egyptology. When Petrie excavated at Ehnasya there were still big mounds belonging to the Roman, Byzantine and Islamic Periods. Petrie excavated some of the houses and the coins found in these houses seem to offer a rough guide to the dates for the objects. The latest of these houses date to the seventh century AD (coins of Heraclius). \nThe place is known today as Ihnasiya Umm al-Kimam.\n\nLinen sprang caps were exclusively produced with open patterns, and sometimes combined with decorative coloured threads of wool. They enjoyed widespread popularity in Egypt but are less frequently preserved due to the combination of the fibres.",

When Petrie excavated at Ihnasya there were still big mounds belonging to the Roman, Byzantine and Islamic Periods. Petrie excavated some of the houses and gave them letters in his publication. The coins found in these houses seem to offer a rough guide to the dates for the objects found in the houses. The latest of these houses date to the seventh century AD (coins of Heraclius).",
