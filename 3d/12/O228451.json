The company, making earthenwares and stonewares, won honours in international exhibitions for imitations of Delft (at Brussels 1880), Rouen and S\u00e8vres wares (at Paris 1889).  The company was later affiliated with Villeroy & Boch and continued in business until about 1980.\n\nHistorical significance: This vase, an exuberant example of naturalism, shows Boch Fr\u00e8res working in a style independent of their usual imitations of Delft, Rouen and S\u00e8vres wares.  It was acquired at the time of the Museum's redisplay in 1969 of its 19th century continental collections at the Bethnal Green Museum.",
