The front of the body is plain beige plush, with the back an orange colour with black stripes.  The claws are stitched with black threads, three on each.\n\nThe head is rounded with a snout and made with several panels of cloth to form the shape and colour.  The back of the head is the orange shade lightening to beige at the snout.  Although the mohair has been worn away there are the remains of the black stripes and dots over the head.  The nose and mouth are indicated by black thread stitches and the eyes are black boot buttons.  Under each side of the face is a strip of white representing the tiger's ruffs.  The ears, individually sewn on, appear to be darker on the outside and white on the inner.  The head is tightly stuffed with wood pulp (sawdust) with a finger hole drilled into the centre.",
