Addey (1912-1999) worked as a commercial artist for over sixty years, working for Dorland advertising and Mitchells among other London advertising firms. His work shows the range of products and illustration styles, from aeroplanes and cars, beer and perfume, to satirical cartoons and calendar pin-up girls and is representative of the post war boom in advertising during the late 1940s and 1950s.\n\nThis collage uses pieces of paper stained with red, orange, brown and black to create a pattern. The pieces of paper have been cut out into curved forms and stuck on a sheet of plain cream paper to create a cascading form. This form and the merging tones of the ink staining each piece of paper simulate a depth that recalls a ground covered with autumn leaves. The use of stained paper and collage demonstrates the artist\u2019s perception of different themes and how they can be conveyed through different mediums.",
