The fold-down arched handle (which has a ribbed plastic grip and two metal hooks to carry the bag [5]) is riveted to the  X-shaped side sections, with two sliding metal rings to stabilise it; the frame has an ovoid tubular metal hoop and a transverse metal bar to carry the body shell (2).\n2. collapsible ovoid body with a metal frame covered in blue textured vinyl with a white vinyl lining, and a white-painted hardboard and wood base with three ventilation holes, and exterior beading of metal and cream vinyl.

At each end is a curved metal bar which fits over the edge of the frame (1) between a pair of rubber composition guard rings.\n3. detachable folding arched hood of matching fabric over a metal frame, with a white vinyl lining.  The hood is erected by snapping rigid the two hinged metal side braces, and fastens to the frame (1) with three slot-in metal tabs, two of which are secured with retractable metal pegs; the metal hook at each side of the hood is to anchor the storm flap of the apron.\n4. detachable apron of matching fabric with a white vinyl lining and a see-through panel in the storm-flap; the apron fastens to the pram with a pair of metal discs at each side and two pairs of rings on the storm-flap (one pair metal, one pair plastic) on lengths of elastic.\n5. zip-fastening rectanguloid bag of matching fabric, with curved handles of ivory plastic.

They were unable to afford such a pram for their first daughter Kim (born 1956), but were able to buy this model for her sister Tracy Kay (b 11/10/1961), possibly from Percivals of Walthamstow High Street.",
