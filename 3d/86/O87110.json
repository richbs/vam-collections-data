            "public_access_description": "This caricature shows John Hanson (1922-1998) as Baldasarre, the Brigand Chief  in The Maid of the Mountains, book by Frederick Lonsdale, music by Harold Fraser-Simson, lyrics by Harold Graham, at the Oxford New Theatre in May 1964. It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years. Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn\u2019t needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nActor and singer John Hanson, described as 'the last matin\u00e9e idol', made his first stage appearance in 1946. He appeared on radio programmes including Variety Bandbox, but made his name in 1957 as the romantic hero of The Desert Song which he followed in 1960 with similar roles in The Vagabond King, and The Maid of The Mountain (1964).",
