            "public_access_description": "The most productive European porcelain factory was Meissen in Germany, which manufactured vast quantities of boxes from about 1735-65.  The coat of arms painted on the cover of this box is that of the Raupenstrach von Lowensburg family of Transylvania. Their Latin motto, Virtus post funera crescit, means 'Virtue outlives death'. The scenes of lovers and musicians reflect the influence of French painting.\n\nSnuffboxes made out of porcelain followed the shapes of those made in gold and hardstones. Painted scenes or portraits ornamented the sides, covers and interiors. Changing forms and decoration were important, as these fashion accessories might be chosen to match the season or a particular costume. Most European (though rarely English) porcelain factories made snuffboxes. The largest producer was Meissen in Germany, which manufactured vast quantities of boxes from about 1735-65. A price list of 1765 mentions 11 varieties, the cheapest painted with flowers.  The mounts for this box were also made in Germany.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
