Fedorovitch died before the first night of \"Orpheus\".  \nIn the sets for \"Orpheus\" lyres and harps were used as a recurrent motif, the lyre for the tomy of Eurydice and in the finale, harps for the underworld and, particularly, flanking the stage for the Dance of the Blessed Spirits.  The Museum has the set model for the Dance of the Blessed Spirits scene (E.5419-1958) and costume designs in the Buckle gift.  \n\"Veneziana\", as indicated by the title, had a Venetian theme, and was primarily a divertissement.  There are five finished costume designs for the ballet in the collection (S.1893-1986; S.1894-1986; S.1895-1986; S.1896-1986; S.1897-1986).  \nThe notebook came to the Museum as part of a gift from the dancer Maude Lloyd, who was a close friend and colleague of Andr\u00e9e Howard.\n\nHistorical significance: Theatre designers sketchbooks are comparatively rare and this sequence of three are especially significant in being the ideas for the last productions on which Sophie Fedorovitch, one of the finest theare and ballet designers of the first half of the 20th century, worked.  The production of \"Orpheus\" had a particular poignancy; not only did Fedorovitch die before the first night, it was the last performances of Kathleen Ferrier, who sang Orpheus.",
