His wife Kate, also an artist, was the daughter of Charles Dickens. \n\nThe subject of the portrait, John Forster (1812-76) was an historian, biographer, and collector of books, manuscripts, paintings, drawings and engravings. He bequeathed his collections to the V&A; they include 48 oil paintings (both continental old masters and modem British works), and almost all of the manuscripts of Charles Dickens's novels. Forster first studied law, qualifying as a barrister in 1843, but from 1832 he was contributing articles and reviews to various publications. He was editor of the <u>Foreign Quarterly Review</u> (1842-3), the <u>Daily News</u> (1846) and the <u>Examiner</u> (1847-55). His biographies include the <u>Lives of the Statesmen of the Commonwealth</u> (5 vols, 1836-9), <u>Oliver Goldsmith</u> (1848), <u>WaIter Savage Landor</u> (2 vols, 1860) and - most famously - the <u>Life of Charles Dickens</u> (3 vols, 1872-4).\n\nOther portraits of Forster in the V&A collections include an oil painting by Daniel Maclise of about 1830 (P.35-1935) and another by  E M Ward of around 1850 (P.74-1935), two pen and ink sketches by Maclise of 1840, a watercolour by Clarkson Stanfield of about 1842, and a photograph <i>carte de visite</i>. Another portrait of Forster by Maclise, in the role of Kitely in Ben Johnson's play <u>Every Man in his Humour</u>, exhibited at the RA in 1848, is also in the V&A (F.20).\n\nThis portrait by Perugini was reproduced as the frontispiece to Richard Renton's book <u>John Forster and his Friendships</u>, 1912.",
