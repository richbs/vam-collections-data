            "public_access_description": "Anish Kapoor (born 1954) is primarily a sculptor. He was born in India but trained as an artist in London and lives and works mostly in Britain. His work is abstract but at the same time suggests particular types of space, place and substance. Within each work, and exploiting the particular qualities of the medium - in this case aquatint - he suggests a whole range of dualities and contradictions. For example, this print suggests entry and exit; vagina and phallus: blood and fire, earth and water; fearful chasm or entry to sexual bliss. This kind of imagery reflects his heritage of Indian mythology, religion and philosophy fused with European aesthetic ideas.",

            "bibliography": "Timmers, Margaret (ed), <i>Impressions of the Twentieth Century: Fine Art Prints from the V&A's Collection</i>, London, V&A Publications, 2001\nThe full text of the entry is as follows: \n\n\"<b>Anish Kapoor (born 1954)</b> \n\n<i>Untitled</i>, 1988 \n\nMany of the finest intaglio prints acquired by the museum over the last two decades have been produced at Crown Point Press, since the 1960s one of the most stimulating workshops in the Us.  In an era when artists are increasingly turning their backs on the traditional printmaking techniques to work with video, laser and computer-aided print, Crown Print proves that tradition still generates innovation.  This image, one of a pair, clearly shows the medium of aquatint, offering translucence, variable depth and intensity, a perfect vehicle for Kapoor's concerns. \nSpeaking in 1991 of his experiences as an Indian working in Britain, Kapoor says that only after leaving college did he recognize that he was in any way different from his peers.  A brief but crucial trip to India helped him to find the material with which to work.  He explained in an interview with Marianne Brouwer: \n<i>I'm not talking about a physical material, but an emotional, mental material something to do with light and more than anything else with earth.  In India there is an incredible romanticism about the earth as giver, nurturer, mother, like there is about the rain.  The two go together.  Culture seems to spring directly from the earth instead of from the mind.  When you talk about colour for instance, it's not an abstract phenomenon, it's a phenomenon of the earth, like a functionary of abundance.  Inevitably light ties into that.  Fundamentally everything seems to be about dichotomy, opposition, polarity...[But] I am not setting out to make Indian art.  I am setting out to make as deep and meaningful art as I can.  Irrespective of whether I am Indian or not.  At the same time, I will not refuse from myself that which is Indian.  And if those who look at my work find that a stumbling block, they must educate themselves</i>. \nAs this print exemplifies, Kapoor explores a whole range of dualities and contradictions: entry and exit; vagina and phallus; blood and fire; earth and water; fearful chasm or entry to sexual bliss.  Such themes do reflect Kapoor's Indianness but also symbolize emerging ambivalences within the fusion of European, Asian and African identities in Britain in the 1980s.\"",
