            "bibliography": "Parkinson, R., Victoria and Albert Museum, <u>Catalogue of British Oil Paintings 1820-1860</u>, London: HMSO, 1990, p. 31\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\"CLINT, George ARA (1770-1854)\n\nBorn Brownlow Street, Drury Lane, London, 12 April 1770, son of a hairdresser. After school in Yorkshire, worked in turn for a fishmonger, attorney, housepainter, and bookseller. Trained first as a miniature painter; acquaintance with John Bell (see FA253, p31) and his nephew Edward Bell led him to produce mezzotints; also made coloured copies from prints after George Morland and others. First oil painting was a portrait of his wife, which resulted in an introduction to Sir William Beechey RA. Exhibited 99 works at the RA between 1802 and 1845, nine at the BI 1815-42, and 15 at the SBA 1831-47. Almost all were portraits, and after 1816 many were of actors and theatrical scenes in the tradition of Zoffany and Samuel de Wilde. His studio in Gower Street became a rendezvous for the leading actors and actresses of the day. Elected ARA 1821; repeated failure to be elected RA resulted in his resignation 1836. Died Kensington, London, 10 May 1854.\n \nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1854, pp212-3 (obit by his pupil R W Buss) \n\n<b>Portrait of John Bell, Publisher</b> \nFA253 Neg 69987 \nCanvas, 127 x 101.6 cm (50 x 40 ins) \nGiven by Charles Masters 1868 \n\nExhibited at the RA in 1826. John Bell (1745-1831) was a famous printer and publisher, notable for discarding the long 'f (for \u2018s\u2019) from his fount of type, for his numerous popular editions of British poetry and drama (his <i>Pantheon and Shakespeare</i> are shown on his desk), and for his highly successful <i>Bell's Weekly Messenger</i>. He holds a copy of this in the portrait, of which the date may be read as 'no. 1011 October 28'; this might be the issue of 1805 which reported the Battle of Trafalgar and the death of Nelson which occurred a week before. Mayes comments that 'where he deserves more recognition than he has so far received is as a vigorously creative patron and a populariser of British art - especially theatrical art -largely through the medium of past-publications ... ' (p100). \n\nThe artist was well acquainted with Bell. An engraving by Thomas Lupton after the painting was published as representing the sitter at the age of 80, that is, in about 1825. The donor was a part-proprietor of <i>Bell's Weekly Messenger</i>; the portrait was in his possession by 1868, when he lent it to the National Portraits exhibition before giving it to the museum. \n\nOther portraits of Bell include a print by George Arnald, a pencil and watercolour drawing by William Douglas (SNPG), and a coloured etched caricature entitled 'A Real TB' (that is, a 'true blue', a Tory royalist) by Richard Dighton (1821; republished in <i>City Characters</i> as pl 39, 1824). Morison refers to Bell having 'a handsome, affectionate and mellow countenance\u2019. \n\nEXH: RA 1826 (4); <i>National Portraits</i> South Kensington Museum 1868 (239) \n\nENGR: Thomas Lupton 1825 \n\nLIT: S Morison <i>John Bell</i>, 1745-1831 1930, p86; I Mayes 'John Bell, The British Theatre and Samuel De Wilde', <i>Apollo</i> February 1981, pp100--3 (repr fig 1, as 'present whereabouts unknown')\"",
