The cover was used to cover the chalice (used to hold the wine to be consecrated during the rite of the Mass) when it is carried to and from the altar, to prevent dust or insects from falling into the chalice. The cream based silk indicates that this chalice cover was intended for use on the feast day of a Saint who was not martyred. \n\nAlthough the Christian religion was not native to China, by the eighteenth century there was some missionary presence there. Embroidered silk vestments and liturgical textiles were made in China, not only to supply the requirements of the churches in China, but also frequently exported to Europe and other new mission posts such as the Philippines.\n\nThere is a possibility that this chalice cover may have been altered and adopted for other uses than its original: the blue braid is clumsily attached across the original embroidered border, and the brightly printed lining is from a different era than the embroidered original, and somewhat uncharacteristic of the normally sober nature of liturgical textiles.",
