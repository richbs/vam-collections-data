The marble slab is shaped around the canted front corners of the two side cabinets. Below the marble an egg and dart ormolu moulding runs along the front and down the sides of the cabinet between each of the four canted corners. At these corners there is a carved bracket with an owl sitting on the head of Medusa and scrolls below. Below the egg and dart moulding a frieze of geometric inlay runs along the front between the Medusa brackets and down the sides of the cabinet. Above the two side cabinet doors this frieze is interrupted by a fluted bracket with a rectangular top, fitting between the egg and dart moulding above and a narrow ormolu laurel moulding below which also runs along the front of the cabinet between the Medusa brackets and down the sides.\n\nThe central cupboard has a glazed door and a silk lined interior with two shelves. \nThe two side cupboard doors are both inlaid with a female figure standing on a pedestal with cupids below, labelled ARCHITETTVRA on the left and PINTVRA on the right.  The two ends of the cabinet are also inlaid with a spray of wheat and poppies in an urn surrounded by scrolls, butterflies, floral swags, snakes; hanging below the urn is a tablet above a trophy of musical instruments and an artist's palette.",

It was illustrated in  <u>The Art Journal, The Illustrated Catalogue of the Universal Exhibition of 1867</u>, p. 17. A front view and detail of the decoration on the side of the cabinet was illustrated on plate CXIII of <u>Art Industry Furniture, Upholstery, and House-Decoration</u> by G.W. Yapp, London c. 1876. The caption read \"A charming production by Messrs. Gillows, of London, a combination of the Console and Glass with the Cabinet and Etagere, formed of several kinds of ornamental woods, the principal carved ornaments being in box, while the elegant designs in the panels, illustrative of Painting and Architecture, are inlaid in various coloured woods. The whole is designed and executed with the utmost delicacy, and in part proof of this we append a sketch of the charming ornamentation, drawn on a much larger scale than the cabinet itself, which decorates the panels on the sides. The Italian style has here been adopted with great taste.\"",
