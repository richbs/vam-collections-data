A chromolithograph is produced by applying the design to be printed onto a stone with a greasy chalk. The surface of the stone is then moistened. As grease and water do not combine, the parts already drawn upon repel the water and the untouched parts absorb it. Greasy ink is passed over the surface. The wet parts reject the ink while the greasy parts attract it. The paper on which the image is to be printed is placed on the surface and together they are passed through a press. One stone is used for each colour.\n\nThis print was produced for the Arundel Society. The subjects, to be reproduced for subscribers to the Society, were chosen by a council who favoured Italian decorative and narrative fresco cycles of the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries. Artists were employed to copy these works of art. The watercolours they produced were examined and selected by the council and then forwarded to the printers.\n\nOwnership & Use\nSubscribers to the Arundel Society were drawn from many walks of life. By the time of the Society's eventual closure in 1897 over 200,000 chromolithographs had been circulated. Regular members would have been in possession of a large number of prints and for this reason many examples found their way into school rooms, churches and village halls where they can still be found today.",

Its aim was to promote a greater knowledge of art through the publication of literary works and reproductions of works of art. Italian decorative and narrative fresco cycles of the fourteenth, fifteenth and sixteenth centuries predominated but classical art was included in the plans from the outset and some examples of the work of Northern European artists were added later.\n\nThe subjects were selected by a Council consisting of people influential in the art world, including John Ruskin, the renowned author and art critic. The emphasis, in keeping with wider current thinking, was on providing instruction rather than enjoyment. The prospectus issued in 1849 stated that 'in their execution, that manner will be preferred which most truthfully expresses the original, rather than that which presents the greatest attraction to the eye'.\n\nBy the time of the Society's closure in 1897 over two hundred chromolithographs had been circulated. Regular members would have been in possession of a large number of prints and for this reason many examples found their way into school rooms, churches and village halls.",
