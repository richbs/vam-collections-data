The blade is engraved with children sowing and reaping whilst the handle is in the shape of an ear of maize. It is possible that Henry Cole, the Museum's first director, saw this as an example of 'appropriate ornament' drawn 'as directly as possible from Nature' in which the decoration of harvesting children and maize cobs underlined its purpose as a bread knife.\n\nPeople\nJohn Bell, a friend of Henry Cole and a successful sculptor, designed this knife for the Felix Summerly Art Manufactures. Cole had adopted the name of Felix Summerly in 1843 when he began to write and produce children's books, having been dissatisfied with the quality of those available for his own family. The Art Manufactures were set up to produce well designed everyday objects designed by the best artists and made by the best manufacturers at affordable prices. This bread knife was made as a reissue of a Felix Summerly design. Although the Art Manufactures were a commercial failure, Henry Cole felt that it had been an important endeavour which should be represented in the new Museum's collection.\n\nHistorical Context\nHenry Cole believed that museums could be 'antidotes to brutality and vice' and could serve to improve people's tastes and morals. The desire to improve the taste of the public was a strong one in the 19th century as a response to the social problems linked with industrialisation.",
