The elections took place between the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and the reunification of East and West Germany.\n\nThis poster reproduces an old oil-painting from the 19th century with a bearded man in the costume of the time. He wears a sticker saying: 'Don't worry, take Gysi'. The PDS deliberately directed its new image at young voters, and the sticker 'Don't worry, take Gysi' plays on the words of a popular song of the time, 'Don't worry, be happy' by Bobby McFerrin.\n\nThe PDS was the immediate successor party of the SED ('Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands - 'Socialist Unity Party of Germany') \u2013 the party that had ruled the communist GDR. The renaming of the party (in December 1989) expressed a new beginning. Nevertheless, at first, the party constituted a shelter and reservoir for the former SED cadres. The idea of a new beginning was incorporated into the messages of the election campaign which adopted a stance of innocence and renewal. Additionally, the PDS demonstrated its new beginning through a new party leader, Gregor Gysi.\n\nGregor Gysi was elected communist party leader after Krenz's resignation in December 1989, when the SED had begun to lose its grip on power and, in the face of popular pressure, had acknowledged the need for democratic change. He was president of the national lawyers association, had defended several prominent dissidents and had worked to obtain legal recognition for the New Forum. The party sought to disassociate itself from the communism of the previous regime, although its philosophy remained firmly rooted in the principles of democratic socialism.",
