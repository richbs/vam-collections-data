She had trained as a painter but from 1932 onwards concentrated on designing for the stage, especially for the ballet, but also for drama. On paper her designs appear impressionistic, usually no more than a few brush strokes, but capture the mood and the essentials; the practical details came later and could be worked out with the costumier. It is a way of working that many costume makers prefer, allowing them to contribute their own ideas so that the finished costume becomes the result of a collaborative process.\n\nThis design was for a star-studded production of Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale in June 1951, directed by Peter Brook at London's Phoenix Theatre and starring John Gielgud as Leontes, Diana Wynyard as Hermione, Virginia McKenna as Perdita, Lewis Casson as Antigonus and Flora Robson as Paulina. Philip Guard played the Clown who wore this costume, and the incidental music was composed by the playwright Christopher Fry.",
