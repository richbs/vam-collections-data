This dish has the trade mark of J. Allsup of 16 St Paul's Church Yard, ca. 1837 - 1852. St Paul's Church Yard had been a centre for the London ceramic retail trade since at least the early eighteenth century. For factories that didn't have a dedicated London show room their network of retail businesses in the capital was highly important. These retailers supplied ceramics to extremely discerning customers for whom shopping had become more than just a leisurely pastime. There were around 20 leading retailers in the early-19th century and Allsup of was remembered by a writer in the Pottery Gazette in 1885 as one of 'The China and glass Dealers of London half a century ago'.",
