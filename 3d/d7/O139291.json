The calligraphy came into the Mughal library and was illuminated by the court artist Daulat, who was in service to the emperor Jahangir (r. 1605-1627). He signed his work, which was probably done in the court atelier at Agra between about 1610 and 1615, in minuscule lettering on the gold ground within the borders at lower left. The panel must have been inherited by Jahangir's son, Shah Jahan, on his accession in 1628 and was incorporated into one of his albums, as demonstrated by the added floral borders which are typical of his reign.\nThe folio which has a portrait of Shah Jahan riding a horse in a landscape on the other side belonged to one of his albums. It was dismembered at an unknown date, and consigned with other folios for sale at Sotheby's, London, in 1925. The lot was described as the property of \"a Nobleman\", known at the time to have been Lord Minto.",
