Founded in Vienna in 1903, it began as an idealistic association of designers and makers who wanted to preserve high-quality craft manufacture. Its fashion department was founded in 1910 under the direction of Eduard Wimmer. This blouse was produced there and is an important part of its history.\n \nThe Italian Ugo Zovetti, who worked for the company between 1910 and 1912, designed the printed silk on this blouse. It was known as the \u2018Mikado\u2019 pattern. The actual design of the blouse bears close similarities to the work of Wimmer and is most probably by him. However, it is also comparable to some of the work of fellow-designer Dagobert Peche.\n \nThe blouse also illustrates the company\u2019s decision to use its printed silks for fashion at the outset of the First World War. In November 1914 a section in the fashion department was set up specifically for making blouses. The minutes of the sixth session (9 October 1915) of the Board of Directors states: \u2018our printed silks, previously used for the most part in the interior decorating branch, have now\u2026found a wide-ranging demand in the clothing industry\u2019.",
