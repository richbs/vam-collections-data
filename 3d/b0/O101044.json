The left hand edge shows two holes, probably later used for screws, and there are several nail/screw holes around the edge of the board. The back face shows various marks including two overlapping 'V' scratched onto the surface. The board is fitted at the back at either end with a mirror plate for display. It shows evidence of old worming, especially at the right top edge and left side.\nThe front face of the board is covered with dark varnish.\n\nThere is no evidence for this board having been part of a bed.",
