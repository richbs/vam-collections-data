            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nOil paintings with subjects taken from popular literature steadily replaced commissions for history paintings in the early 19th century. The public, and most collectors of modern works, began to prefer lighter, sometimes more sentimental, themes. However, as well as painting scenes from humorous literature, Leslie also chose sombre subjects like this one.\n\nSubjects Depicted \nSince the end of the 18th century there had been a massive revival of interest in the works of Shakespeare, and many artists exhibited paintings that illustrated scenes from his plays. Here Leslie depicts Act III, Scene 1 from Henry VIII. The picture shows Henry's first wife, Katherine of Aragon (Shakespeare's 'Queen Katharine'), in a melancholy mood because of the King's growing estrangement. When the painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1842, a quotation from the play, as well as the title of the picture, was given in the catalogue.\n\nPeople\nAlthough Leslie based his representation of Queen Katherine on contemporary portraits, he was not strictly archaeological. Like most of his fellow artists in the 1840s, he tended to mingle various styles and periods. What we would now regard as separate historical styles, and identify as 'late medieval', 'Renaissance', 'Jacobean' and so on,  artists then saw as one style, which they simply called 'Old English'.",

Apprenticed to a publisher 1808, received a few lessons in painting from Thomas Sully. A subscription was raised to enable him to study art in Europe; returned.to London 1811, entered RA Schools and studied with Benjamin West and Washington Allston. Visited Paris 1817 with Allston and Wilkie Collins, met G S Newton, with whom he visited Brussels and Antwerp. Also friend and biographer (published 1843) of John Constable. Exhibited 76 works at the RA between 1813 and 1859, and 11 at the BI 1815-32. Some were portraits, but most were his much admired literary subjects, particularly drawn from Cervantes, Moliere, Shakespeare and Steme. Elected ARA 1821, RA 1826. Several of his works were engraved, and he made six illustrations for Sir WaIter Scott's Waverley novels 1824. Worked for six months as drawing master at West Point Military Academy, New York State, 1833. Professor of Painting at RA 1848-52; his lectures were published as a <U>Handbook for Young Painters</u> (1855). His <u>Life of Reynolds</u> was finished by Tom Taylor and published 1865. Died St John's Wood, London, 5 May 1859. An exhibition at the RA of  30 of his works was held winter 1870. His two sons, George Dunlop and Robert, were also artists. The <u>Athenaeum </u>critic (9 May 1846, p480) wrote that he was 'unrivalled for the certainty of his powers, the <i>wi</i>t of his pencil, the deep knowledge of human nature as exhibited in the more ordinary scenes of life'.\n\nLIT: <u>Art JournaI</u>1856, pp73-5 and 105-7, 1859, p187 (obit); C R Leslie <u>Autobiographical Recollections</u> ed T Taylor, 2 vols, 1860; J Dafforne <u>Pictures by C R Leslie </u> nd [1875]; <u>Art ]ournaI</u>1902, pp 144-8; J Constable <u>The Letters of John Constable and C R Leslie</u> 1931; ed R B Beckett John <u>Constable's Correspondence</u> III, Ipswich 1965 \n\n\n<b>Queen Katherine and Patience </b>\nFA122 Neg GA1l95 \nCanvas, 58.3 X 50.7 cm (23 X 20 ins) \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nThe artist was elected ARA in 1821, and presented an earlier version of this subject as his Diploma Work in 1826; the present work shows the same composition but differs in almost every detail of dress, furniture and accessories. It was exhibited at the RA in 1842 (not, as stated in the 1907 catalogue, 1839), and according to Taylor (<u>Leslie </u>II, p266) was painted for John Sheepshanks. \nThe title given in the RA catalogue, and the appended quotation, are as follows: 'Scene from Henry the Eighth. <i>Queen Katharine</i>: \"Take thy lute, \nwench, my soul grows sad with troubles. Sing and disperse them if thou can'st; leave wishing\".' \nThe quotation is from the opening lines of act 3 scene 1 of Shakespeare <i>King Henry VIII.</i> One of the principal plots concerns the estrangemen between the King and his first wife, Katherine of Aragon, who acts witl dignified resignation; the rest of this scene deals with her confrontation with Cardinal Wolsey. \nThe <u>Art Union</u> critic remembered a very similar subject engraved in one of the illustrated 'Annuals', and thought the painting 'a graceful and beautiful and very touching composition; telling forcibly the sad story of the crowned queen'. The <u>Athenaeum</u> however, which also recalled the engraving, found the picture 'not a felicitous effect. Queen Katharine is too young [in reality, she would have been about 43], and withal looks sullen rather than sad; and the maiden with the lute shares the sour precision of her mistress. Then there is a mildewy coldness of atmosphere, which takes from this pair of melancholy women their one chance of attracting sympathy'. Later critics were far more admiring. Waagen found 'the expression of sorrow in the Queen is very good, and the gloomy keeping of the whole is congenial'. The <u> Art Journal</u> in 1856 thought it 'a beautiful and touching composition', and in 1857 'one of the painter's <i>chef d'oeuvre;</i> the subject is sad, and therefore the treatment is without one pencil of the dusty sunshine which illumines other pictures. We wish the queen's cope had been blue; however, the grave dignity of the composition equals the earnestness of the very best masters of pictorial disposition'. In a text accompanying an engraving after the work, the <u>Art Journal</u> in 1873 analysed the composition at some length, concluding that 'this is a touching picture, the sentiment of which is forcibly worked out; and it evidences in every particular the mind and the hand of a true artist'. \nThe composition, details and mood are somewhat similar to those of R P Bonington's 'Meditation' also of 1826 (engraved 1827, now Wallace Collection), but this is probably due to the fact that both artists went to the same sources, in Dutch 17th-century painting by artists such as Terborch. The image of the Queen is recognisable from the various contemporary portraits of her: see for example the work by an unknown artist in the NPG. \nEXH: RA 1842 (148) \nENGR: C W Sharpe for the <u>Art Journal</u> 1873, facing p204 \nLIT: <u>Athenaeum</u> 14 May 1842, p433; <u>Art Union </u>1842, p122; G Waagen <u>Treasures of Art in Great Britain</u> II, p301; <u>Art Journal</u> 1856, p75, 1857, p240;<u> Leslie</u> II, p266; <u>Art Journal</u> 1873, p204 \n\n\n\n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
