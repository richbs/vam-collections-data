The bottleracks are examples of Morrison's designs being made more cheaply on a larger scale. Nevertheless they retain the same attention to detail and the distinctive styling of his more expensive products. The racks are designed to stack, which has influenced the decision to acquire a group of three. Furthermore, a stack will have more presence in displays, and reiterates the fact that the design is intended as a mass-produced multiple.",
