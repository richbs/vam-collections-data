            "public_access_description": "This cast resin head painted to resemble bronze represents the Italian operatic baritone Tito Gobbi (1915-1984), noted for his fine 'bel canto' voice. He studied law before training as a singer and made his operatic debut in the Italian town of Gubbio 1935 as Count Rudolfo in  Bellini's La Sonnambula.  In 1942 he made his Milan debut at La Scala and appeared at Covent Garden in London in 1951, both times as Belcore in Donizetti's L'Elisir d'Amore.  He appeared in twenty-five films, both in singing and speaking roles, and in the 1950s and 1960s was mostly based in Rome. In later years, he made the Lyric Opera of Chicago his base and retired from the stage in 1979.\n\nThe head belonged to the Russian-born theatrical agent Sandor Gorlinsky (1908-1990) who worked in Britain from 1933 and who represented some of the most celebrated opera and ballet stars of the second half on the 20th century, notably Maria Callas, Montserrat Caball\u00e9 and Rudolph Nureyev, as well as Tito Gobbi.  It was presented to the museum by Sandor Gorlinsky's widow, Edith Gorlinsky.",
