From the bottom of the bodice a 'peplum' is draped upon the left hip, and the very full flaring skirt is caught over it. The dress is mounted on a white silk slip, the bodice is boned and padded. There is a white grosgrain waist band with tapes for hanging. To support the skirt there are tulle petticoats. The outermost has a double layer of soft tulle coming from the hips, below this, in stiffer tulle, four graduated double frills from hips to hem (the topmost is stiffer than the others) and below this a very full tulle skirt. The dress fastens at the back with a white metal zip, a plaquet with snap fasteners, and the drape being fastened with snap fasteners, hooks and eyes.",

He was originally trained by the court dressmaker Reville.\n\nLady Ethel Templer (n\u00e9e Davie, 1904-97), bought this dress in the late 1950s.  She was very slim and was able to buy the original dress worn by a house model for the collection.  It was originally strapless, but she asked Stiebel to add the straps because her shoulders were narrow.  Lady Templer was the wife of the British High Commissioner to Malaya, and required an extensive wardrobe for the many formal dinners and state functions that she had to attend.\n\nThe embroidery upon the bodice would have originally been more silvery than it appears now.  The metal has oxidised making it appear slightly black and dull.",
