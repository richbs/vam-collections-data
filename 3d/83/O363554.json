            "physical_description": "A hood made of woven wool with embroidered decoration. Most of it remains and has been sewn to a modern linen for support. The hoof is formed from a rectangular piece of undyed wool (twill; s-spun), folded over and sewn along one edge (sewn with an undyed wool thread and then sewn over with purple wool as decoration). The final shape is retangular with a sharp corner at the crown. The head fits under the sewn edge. It is decorated with woollen embroidery. The colours are a pink and a purple/red (where the two colours are twinned together). The edges of the cowl are bordered with a band of decoration. In the centre of the band the purple wool forms a wavy line and red thread makes a single dot between the waves. Either side of the wave is one pink line and then a purple line. The lines are made of two/three pieces of thread sewn at intervals to the main fabric. The front of the cowl is decorated with purple wool, hemmed as a series of loops along the edge. One either side of the head is a decoration icon, sewn approximately where the ears would be. It is wheel-like in form (a wheel within a wheel). At the centre is a red dot surrounded by a thick ring of purple which has a series of spokes around its edge. Two thin pink lines encircle this and another purple circle is around the pink lines and it too has spokes around its outside. A small portion of the hem at the bottom of the cowl remains. The piece has holes and some staining.\n\nThis hood compares to one attached to a child's tunic in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Radiocarbon dated to AD430-620 (95% probability). This hood has fringes in green and red/brown along the perimeter of the hood and lower edges. The tunic is similar in construction to an adult tunic but with a hood which is sewn into the back of the neck opening. Hoods were typical on a child's tunic from Roman to Byzantine times and were often made of a separately woven rectangular piece of cloth. They were often adorned with roundels and fringes along the top. The decoration of a hood would match the tunic cuffs and sides.",
