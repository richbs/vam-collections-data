            "history_note": "Probably made for the dairy adjoining Queen Mary II's lodgings in the Old Water Gallery at Hampton Court between 1689 and 1694. This was furnished to designs by court architect Daniel Marot (1661-1752). Mary's 'Delftware closet' was hung with Delft tile panels and the Dairy equipped with milk pans.  Marot might also have been involved with the design of the Delftware. The decorative scrolls and borders are typical for his Baroque style.  The V&A has two similar AK-marked milk pans, each with different decorative details,  which also could have come from this dairy. This is the only example known which is decorated with enamel colours. The pastoral landscapes are directly copied from contemporary prints.  The mark \"AK\"  is for Adrianus Kocx, the proprietor of the Grieksche A from 1686 until 1701.  In 1695, the year after Mary's death, King William was invoiced by Adrianus Kocks for 'the sume of Thirteen Hundred & Fifty Gilders 3 Styvers of English Money \u00a3 122 li 14s. 09d'.",
