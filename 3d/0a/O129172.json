Avant garde performance was provided by David Mairowitz's 'Flight of the Aerogenius' which continued over several UFOs, a light show by Jack Bracelin's Five Arc Lights and poetry by Pete Brown.  The UFO club ran from 10:30pm to 'dawnlite'.  On these two evenings different types of music, films such as the artist Salvador Dali's famous 'Chien Andalou' and Disney cartoons, as well as Mark Boyle's art event light show 'Son et Lumiere of Earth, Air, Fire and Water' were held.\nMichael English recalls packing into taxis with twenty friends and \"Speeding through gloomy streets that were dark and empty and almost dead, suddenly bright splashes of colour flashed from the hoardings and all around the building sites there were bright fluorescent lips - sometimes only one, sometimes three of four together - screaming 'COME TO UDO, OPENING TONIGHT.'  Twenty curving lips screaming in unison 'EVERYBODY'S WELCOME'.  Amazing pink lips lit up the night with an invitation 'STAY TIL IT'S LIGHT'.\"\n\nText by Julia Bigham"
