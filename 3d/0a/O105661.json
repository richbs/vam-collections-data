He wears a long-sleeved, pale red skirted jacket, reaching to mid-thigh; at the neck is a small white  collar with a knotted black fringed tie, otherwise the body is styled and decorated as his partner's bodice.

The military hint to her costume implies she might be a vivandi\u00e8re, one of the women accompanying armies on campaign, selling them liquor and supplies.  The spurs and gold flashes on the heels were used by the dancers almost like castanets, emphasising the clicks as the heels were brought together in a movement characteristic of the national dances of Eastern Europe.  \nThe Polka was originally a Bohemian folk dance. Jules Perrot and Carlotta Grisi introduced it to London in April 1844 and created an immediate sensation. Their pictures were everywhere, not only as prints, but on ceramics and on music sheets. Soon it stormed the ballrooms and became one of the most popular social dances of the century.  Today, it is generally remembered as the dance taught by Anna to the King of Siam in the musical The King and I.",

Eventually numbering 145 items, some of which had belonged to the ballerina Anna Pavlova, it was one of the first and most important specialist collections in private hands.  \nRambert bought the first print as a wedding present but could not bear to give it away.  As the collection grew, it was displayed in the bar of the Mercury Theatre, the headquarters of Ballet Rambert, but in 1968, Rambert gave the collection to the Victoria and Albert Museum; seven duplicates were returned to Rambert, but these are catalogued in Ivor Guest's A Gallery of Romantic Ballet, which was published before the collection came to the V&A.  Although often referred to as a collection of Romantic Ballet prints, there are also important engravings of 17th and 18th century performers, as well as lithographs from the later 19th century, by which time the great days of the ballet in London and Paris were over.",
