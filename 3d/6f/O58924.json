            "public_access_description": "Jean Nicolas Lambert made finely decorated stringed instruments of the highest quality at the Rue Michel le Comte in Paris from about 1743 until his death in 1761. His widow continued the business until about 1785, so this instrument, dated 1772, would have been made when the workshop was under her management. During the 17th and 18th centuries, the viola d'amore was particularly popular throughout Italy and Central Europe, and  noted for its sweet tone. Seven gut strings were played by the bow, while seven 'sympathetic' strings placed underneath the fingerboard responded to the vibration.",
