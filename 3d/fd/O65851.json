Persian, early 17th century.\nWARP: yellow silk; Z4S; 32 threads per inch (124 per dm).\nWEFT: white cotton; Z spun, unplied*; 2 and 3 parallel threads per shoot and 3 shoots (1 of  2 parallel threads, 1 of  3 parallel threads and 1 of 2 parallel threads) after each row of knots; 14 knots per inch (54 per dm counted at 27 per 5 cm). * it is possible that these threads were originally loosely plied, but they have relaxed and now lie parallel.\nPILE: wool and cotton; 12 colours: red, light red, orange, light orange, yellow, dark green, green, dark blue, blue, light blue, black, white (cotton); NB: black and light blue are corroded. The red is Lac; the yellow is Luteolin and possibly Tricin; the orange is Madder and Luteolin. Asymmetrical knot open to the left and tied around 2 threads; 84 knots to the sq. inch (3348 per sq. dm). \nSIDE FINISH: Left-hand side is cut.  Right-hand side is missing.\nEND FINISH: Lower end is missing.  Upper end is cut.\nDESIGN: Field: extreme right-hand side of field, 2\" (5 cm) wide, has red ground with evidence of yellow primary and black secondary stems with small rosettes and parts of larger, composite blossoms.\nMain border: 1'1.5\" (34 cm) wide has dark green ground with one and two half rows of scalloped medallions, the red being round, the yellow cartouche-shaped and the green and pink palmette-shaped.  A small red circular pendant joins the red medallions to their vertical neighbour, otherwise all abutt.  The lower two halves which are red, frame a large, multi-coloured half-palmette, the two green halves above enclose blossoms on red and black stems while the upper two half-cartouches each has a light blue cloudband with a small pink flower. The central cartouche encloses a facing pair of red-headed and winged blue birds above red flowers; above, a pink palmette-medallion frames a blue blossom with an orange and yellow centre and surrounded by four small yellow flowers on green stems.  The upper, red medallion has a blue, decorated peacock with a green erect tail surrounded by six light orange flowers on green stems.  All the medallions are outlined in yellow. The dark green ground is decorated principally with cloudbands and orange flowers on orange stems.\nInner border: light orange ground with an arabesque meander in light blue, punctuated by red blossoms from which curve short black stems.  Through the arabesques runs a fine black stem bearing florets.\nOuter border: as Inner, except that the central pair of arabesques are red, are joined by a blue blossom and each contains a black blossom outlined in white.\n\nDate analysed: 6.6.95",
