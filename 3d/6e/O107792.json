The earliest knitted objects are found in Spain, and we think the craft was introduced via Islamic culture from North Africa. \n \nThese gloves were hand-knitted in stocking stitch from red silk and yellow silk wrapped with silver strip. They were made for a bishop and are decorated with religious symbols. These include a cross surmounting a heart, a shepherd's crook or bishop\u2019s crozier to the left, and a reliquary to the right. The cuffs are patterned with geometric designs and a Greek wave motif appears on the fingers and wrist. The silver-gilt bobbin lace and plaited braid applied to the fingers gives the appearance of the seam lines in sewn leather gloves.\n\nThese gloves are knitted in the round, with the second thread woven into the back of the stitches so that the inside is neatly finished. The thumb was knitted separately, also in the round, and there is a diamond-shaped gusset between the thumb and index finger.",
