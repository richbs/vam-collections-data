A tonsured St Anthony of Padua is shown in Franciscan habit with his attribute, the Infant Jesus seated on a book, referring to his vision of the Infant Christ when preaching on the Incarnation (the belief that Christ became man). He presents a kneeling nun, possibly from the female branch of the Franciscan order known as the Poor Clares, to the Holy figures on the missing central panel. She fervently presses her hands together in a gesture of prayer- a model for the pious beholder to emulate.",

The main influences on his style were those of Bruges van Eyck, Rogier van der Weyden, Hugo van der Goes and Hans Memlinc. \n\nFollower of Gerard DAVID \n81 \nLEFT WING OF AN ALTARPIECE: \nST ANTHONY OF PADUA WITH A NUN\n<i>Oak panel </i> \n30 1/4 X 13 (76.5 X 33) \n528-1870 \n\nOriginally catalogued as German(?) (1893 <i>Catalogue,</i>p. 190), this painting may be placed in the circle of Gerard David. Both the figures and the foliage may be compared, for example, with David's <i>Canon Bernardinus de Salviatis and three Saints</i> of c. 1501 in the N. G. (M. Davies, <i>Early Netherlandish School,</i>2nd ed., 1955, p. 30). \nSt Anthony of Padua is shown with his attribute, the Infant Jesus seated on his book, which refers to his legendary vision of the Virgin and Child. He appears with this attribute in several paintings by Gerard David, for example, in the altar-piece of St Michael in Vienna and that of St Anne in Philadelphia (E. von Bodenhausen, <i>Gerard David und seine Schule,</i>1905, pp. 166, 168, repr.). \n<i>Prov.</i>Milanese collection (seal of the Intendenza di Milano on back); John Parsons; bequeathed to the Museum in 1870.\"\nEberhard von Bodenhausen, <u>Gerard David und seine Schule.</u> M\u00fcnchen, F.

However, approximately 60 paintings can be ascribed to him with some authority: about half are single devotional panels, mainly Epiphanies and scenes from the Passion of Christ, about ten religious triptychs and one or two polyptychs.

He developed a gift for preaching and was given teaching posts in Italy and France.\nHe had a deep knowledge of the Bible and preached on the moral life and correct faith. In his lifetime he was called 'the hammer of heretics'. He died at Padua in north Italy in about 1231 and his shrine in the church of the Santo became a place of pilgrimage. In art he is usually shown holding a lily and carrying the child Jesus.
