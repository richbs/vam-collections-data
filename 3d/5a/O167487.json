In the superstructure, below a concave cornice are three short drawers above three graduate long drawers of graduated depth. Fluted corners. In the substructure, below a sliding shelf are three long drawers of graduated depth, the lowest centred on a concave semicircular panel with ray device inlaid in light and dark woods. Square bracket feet.\n\nThe lower section retains its original bracket feet and has an upper slide. The book matched veneer at the sides is from the same plank and the same knot is thus repeated six times. The drawers have oak linings and there are yellow baltic pine dust boards. The drawers are rebated with the rebates chamfered at the ends.",
