The two pierced suspension holes at the top are original and made to fit a piece of string. Such plaques were mostly made in small series, in this case illustrating the lives of women Saints. Our plaque\ndepicts Christ appearing to St. Mary of Oignies, seated having supper and showing her the souls in hell. Another plaque in the V&amp;A, of the same shape and size, shows St Mechtilde von Hackenborn-Wippra (1240-41). It is likely that these both belonged to a series made for a nunnery. \n\nMoulded plaques with rococo frames in pure white tin-glazed earthenware are among the highest quality products made by the Alcora factory. Factory documents from the 1750s and 60s variously report on the production of plaques 'of different moulds or 'newly invented moulds'.",
