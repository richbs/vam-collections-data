            "bibliography": "Ward-Jackson, Peter, Italian Drawings Volume II. 17th-18th century, London: Her Majesty's Stationary Office, 1980, p. 170. The text is as follows: POLETTI, FERDINANDO (active early 18th century) 1093-1171 As Mr Allan Braham was the first to perceive, the drawings catalogued under this name were made for the funeral service of the Emperor Joseph I in S. Maria dell\u2019Anima, the German church in Rome, in 1712. They are pasted in a folio album containing 53 pages, bound in brown 18th century tooled calf, with gold and green decorated end-papers. There is no title on the binding, but the drawing on the first page is headed Disegni originali del P. Guerini in ink in an 18th century hand. Some of the pages are stamped in dark purple ink with the Ex Libris of Dr W. M\u00fcseler. The album was included, and two drawings were illustrated, in the Marlborough Rare Books Catalogue, 1963, no. 50, with an attribution to the Neapoliton painter Domenico Guarini. But nothing more is known of the provenance of the book, which was bought by the Museum in 1969. Among the drawings for the funeral of Joseph I, are others connected with the funeral of his father Leopold I, which took places in 1705. These are catalogued separately under the name Carlo Fontant, who was responsible for the designs, having held the appointment of architect to the Emperor. Joseph Schmidlin in his Geschiechte der deutschen Nationalkirche in Rom, S. Maria dell\u2019Anima (Freiburg im Bresgau, 1906, pp. 575ff.) gives an ccount of the two funerals and of the sources on which a history of them may be based. The most important printed source for Jospeh\u2019s funeral is the contemporary accoubt of Giangi Vittorri Romano: \u2018Esatta Relazione del funebre catafalco inalzato nell\u2019imperial chiesa dell\u2019Anima\u2026in occasione delle solenni essequie par l\u2019Augustissimo Imperatore Giuseppe Primo. Con disegno, dispisizione & invensione del Signor Ferdinando Poletti Romano Architetto, allievo di Casare Corvara dif el. Mem. Insigne Architetto di detta Imperiale Chiesa,\u2019 Rome 1712. This established the interesting fact that the designs are not by Carlo Fontana (who was now 74 years old and in bad health) but by Ferdinando Poletti, a Roman and a pupil of Cesare Corvara (1650-1708), architect to the church of S. Maria dell\u2019Anima. This little-known artist, presumably an architect, was probably identical, as Braham observes, with the Ferdianndo Poletti who was active, especially as a designer of temporary decorations, in the service of Austian Viceroy of Nepals in the years 1720-21. (See F. Mancini, Feste ed apparati civili e religiosi in Naoli, 1968, p. 41 and passim.) All the drawings in the album are in pen and ink and wash, unless otherwise stated. Many of them can be recognized in Vittorii\u2019s description. They are accordingly listed here in groups in the same order as Vittorii. LITERATURE Allan Braham, \u2018Funeral decorations in eighteenth century Rome\u2019 (Victoria nd Albert Museum Brochure no. 7), London, 1975. What follows is to a great extent based on this study by Mr Braham and on conversations with him.
