Full Citation: \n \n\"<b>65 Unknown Man, formerly called Richard Cromwell</b> \n(b.1626 d.1712)  \n<b>1647</b>  \nP20-1941  \n \n<b>Oval 48 x 39 mm</b>  \n \nFeatures in free, wiry hatches of sanguine and brown, shadowed with blue-grey, over a thick creamy carnation; the hair in pale brown wash, lined and hatched in darker colour; the armour in grey wash, hatched and heightened with gouache; touches of gold in the armour and a narrow gilt band in the margin; background a pale blue wash, very slightly hatched to produce a shading behind the head; on vellum put down on a leaf from a table-book. \n\n<b>Condition:</b> Apparently pristine.  \n \n<b>Signed:</b> In gold, centre right: S.C:/ 1647. Inscribed on the back, probably by the artist, in brown wash: <i>[Wed]nesday morn[ing]</i> - the inscription truncated when the card was trimmed for setting; compare inscription on Cat. No. 90 [449-1892], the format of which is the original large rectangle.  \n \n<b>Frame:</b> Late nineteenth- or early twentieth-century silver-gilt oval locket, the convex back and rounded sides curving round to the bezel, then turned over the convex glass; the hanger of elongated tear-drop form of D-section, made from two wires soldered together and bifurcating into tapering spirals of five turns. Cf. also Cat. Nos 72, 80 and 94 [P.19-1941; P.21-1941; P.22-1942], all reframed by the Josephs; the locket packed out with cut trade cards of Miers the silhouettist, and of <i>Joseph Heming & Co/Manufacturing Jewellers/[Wa]tch Makers/New Bond Street/N.W/ Repaired and Cleaned.</i>  \n \n<b>Provenance:</b> Probably by 1865, Edward Cheney; his sale, Christie's 29 April 1885, lot 311, bt Davis (101 gns, in a blue enamel case); S S Joseph; Mrs Emma Joseph, by whom presented to the Museum, May 1941.  \n \n<b>Exhibited:</b> Probably South Kensington 1865, no. 458.  \n \n<b>Literature:</b> Probably Foster 1914-16, vol. II, p. 32, no. 171 and p. 163 (as Richard Cromwell); Foskett 1974, p. 109; Reynolds 1975, p. 21; <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 10. \n\nThe former identification as Richard Cromwell (1626-1712) has no evident authority. Carl Winter in 1941 was generally sceptical of claims for the sitters in the Joseph Collection. Since Winter, no one has worked specifically on this miniature, but his doubts have been generally adopted. The portrait is not discussed by Piper (1) in his entry for the Richard Cromwel1, where he seems nevertheless tolerant of the following mixed bag of miniatures: \n\n1  Hoskins, signed and dated 1646 (Buccleuch Collection). \n2 ' Some of the numerous miniatures' by Cooper listed in Foster 1914-16, vol. III\nThese are not readily identifiable, but the following should be representative:\na  Foster 171 - probably the present miniature. \nb  Foster 167 - probably Starr Collection, catalogued uncritically as Richard Crornwell for NPG 1974 (no. 44). \nc  Foster 164 - ex-Northwick and Addington Collections, signed and dated 1649; possibly Sotheby's 1 June 1970, lot 12, catalogued tentatively as Henry Cromwell. \nd/e  Foster 166 and 177 - Duke of Buccleuch, probably NPG 1974 (nos 45 and \n46), both catalogued as possibly <i>Henry Cromwell</i>, a judgement derived from \nKennedy; (2) Millar (3) was doubtful that no. 46 was Henry. \nf  Foster 1 75 - ex -C E Lees Collection, signed and dated 1653, reproduced in the catalogue of BFAC 1889 (Case XXIX, no. 28, pl. XI).This likeness is probably compatible with Foster 166. \ng  Foster 168 - Signed and dated 1643, and the other dated portraits of 1653, 1655 and 1658, have either disappeared without trace or been exposed as forgeries: they are not listed by Foskett (4)  among the dated works by Cooper which she had encountered. \n3  A miniature, called School of Hoskins, Sotheby 9 March 1964, lot 39; not mentioned by Piper, but apparently a derivation from the painting in the Cromwell-Bush Collection of c.1658, commonly regarded as the authoritative image of him. \n\nThe iconography of Richard Cromwell is thus extremely confused. The only reasonably firm base is provided by the Cromwell-Bush portrait and its dependent engravings, but this type dates, according to Piper, from more than a decade after the miniature under discussion, and comparison may thus be misleading. Such as it is, however, comparison is hardly encouraging. Of the two 'early' portraits that are said to be of Richard Cromwell and have survived unscathed by questions, the Buccleuch Hoskins and the Starr Cooper are quite unlike this miniature and are probably incompatible with each other and with the Cromwell-Bush type; nor is there any Significant similarity between this miniature and any other of the claimed likenesses, including those that are alternatively called Henry Cromwell. \n\n1 Piper 1963. \n2 Kennedy 1917, p.16.\n3 Millar 1974. \n4 Foskett 1974.\"\n<u>Victoria and Albert Museum, Department of Engraving, Illustration and Design and Department of Paintings, Accessions 1941</u>, London: HMSO, 1954.\nThe full text of the record is as follows:\n\n<b>'COOPER, Samuel (1609-1672)\n</b>...\n\nMiniature portrait of a man in armour, said to be Richard Cromwell (1626-1712), third son of Oliver Cromwell.<i>\nSigned and dated</i> S.C./1647.<i>\nOn parchment on card.
