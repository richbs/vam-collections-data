Engraved in' copper-plat' at the back: &lt;i&gt;Sir W Kingsmil.&lt;/i&gt;",

Engraved in' copper-plat' at the back: <i>Sir W Kingsmil.</i> \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> Not part of the Wallop Loan; possibly therefore one of the few early miniatures bought independently by Alan Evans; bequeathed by Alan Evans to the National Gallery, 1974; placed on indeterminate loan at the V&A. (See Appendix 3). \n\n<b>Literature:</b> <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 24 (as by Gibson.) \n\nThe identification rests on the late inscription on the locket, and before that possibly on a family provenance or association, which would have provided an incentive to find a sitter of the right date in the genealogies. Sir William Kingsmill appears conveniently in the 1912 editions of Burke's <i>Landed Gentry</i> and the <i>Landed Gentry of Ireland</i>, covering the two branches of the Kingsmill family which divided in the generation following this. Sir William was a knight, purchased Sydmonton Court, (1) Hampshire, and was Sheriff of Hampshire from 1643. He married money, in the person of Anne (daughter of Sir Anthony Haslewood of Mindwell) , who bore him a son, William, in 1660; after her husband's death, 3 September 1661, she married Sir Thomas Ogle. Geographically (for Sydmonton was within easy range of Gibson's ambit in the 1650s), politically and socially, Kingsmill is a plausible candidate, and he must have married at about the date of this miniature, but he would have been in his early forties at about this time, and the sitter here looks arguably younger. \n\nThe miniature was attributed to 'D Gibson' in the valuation of the Evans Collection carried out by Christie's (2) presumably following the criteria put forward in Reynolds 1952 for attributions to this putative artist. Reynolds himself, however, had no opportunity to record an opinion, since the miniature was evidently in Evans's private collection. Subsequently the connoisseur Robert Bayne-Powell commented 'Not by any Gibson'.(3) \n\nThis scepticism is valid, for although the stylistic and technical character of the miniature is certainly that of Richard Gibson, the quality of the painting in detail is suspect, and the Gibsonian method seems imitative rather than freshly authentic. The miniature may simply be a tired piece or repetition by Gibson himself, or perhaps a copy after him by one of his elder children, under instruction from him. The casually knotted plain linen neckcloth suggests a date in the later 1650s (cf. Cat. No. 97; the extremely curly hair here is presumably natural, and not one of the post-Restoration styles), so probably only William, of the children we know about, would have been old enough to be the painter. \n\n1 Which now belongs to Lord Lloyd Webber. \n2 Christie's valuation 1969, p. 12; the earlier Christie's valuation of 1959, preserved in the department library, also attributes the miniature to Gibson. \n3 MS note of 1975 in departmental copy of 1969 valuation.\" \n",
