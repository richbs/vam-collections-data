Both are marked with the stamp of his workshop. In the early 1840s Vetter made a number of important pieces of Gothic Revival furniture for Schloss Stolzenfels near Koblenz in western Germany, and these chairs are very similar in style. Stolzenfels was designed by the architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel, who was the most accomplished designer in the Gothic style in Germany at the time. It is possible that he also designed these two chairs.",
