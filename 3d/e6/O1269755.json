His early style demonstrated classic tailoring with a subversive twist drawn from streetstyle and club culture.\n\nThis shirt, paired with the trousers T.52:2-2013, could be worn conventionally as smart officewear during the day, then rebuttoned and changed to make a bolder statement at night. This transformative style was in-line with the 1980s fashion for the customisation of clothing, and reflects Casely-Hayford\u2019s interest in traditional tailoring and how it could be subverted and brought up to date.\n\nIn the designer\u2019s own words: \u2018This outfit would have been worn at some of the cooler clubs, like Wag, where the dress style was modern retro\u2019.",
