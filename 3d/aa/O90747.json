Has an upturned wing nailed to each side of the body and two flat wood tulips, painted orange, yellow and pink protruding from the top of the bird's tail. The body is hooked on to a length of copper wire threaded with blue and pink wooden beads, which in turn rests inside a groove in two vertical wooden pieces (the bird's legs) on a flat purple painted wooden stand. The bottom beak is hinged and a purple wooden bead with two orange feathers and an insect hangs from a length of white thread attached to an L shaped piece of copper wire which protrudes from the bird's head. When the bird is gently pushed, the body rocks to and fro; the beak opens and closes attempting to catch the insect.",

The fisherman sways precariously on his \u201criver bank\u201d when touched, while the comical bird attempts to catch the \u201cfly\u201d when his body is rocked to and fro.\n\nTony Mann was voted \u201cToymaker of the Year\u201d by the British Toymakers\u2019 Guild for both 1987 and 1988. He originally trained as an industrial designer and worked in this field for twenty years in both this country and Canada, (where he emigrated in 1962.) He later set up degree courses at the College of Art and Design in Nova Scotia where he still teaches one term a year. The rest of the year is devoted to toymaking, and , when in England, he is based at Chulmleigh, Devon.",
