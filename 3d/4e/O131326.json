He exhibited from 1843 to 1884 at the Society of British Artists, the British Institution and the Royal Academy  (1848-81). According to Christopher Wood, 'he is also known to have painted views of Venice in the manner of Canaletto and Guardi, which were passed off as originals.' (Christopher Wood, <u>Dictionary of Victorian Painters</u>, 1971, p.57.)\n\nThis painting, <u>Very Important</u>, shows a middle-aged man in 18th century dress sitting at a desk and writing with a quill pen, with an expression of concentration on his face. Both the title and period detail are suggestive of a background narrative (who is this man? what is 'very important'?) without actually supplying it.  \n\nThis painting was bequeathed to the V&A by Joshua Dixon (1811-1885), a successful cotton merchant. In addition to oil paintings, watercolours and drawings, his collection also included engravings, Japanese vases and panels, and bronze and marble sculpture. Born in Dalston, north-east London, Dixon died on his estate of Winslade Park in Somerset and left his collection initially to the Bethnal Green Museum, which is part of the V&A, for the 'benefit of the people of East London.'",
