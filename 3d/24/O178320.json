ORT [Organisation for Rehabilitation Through Training] was founded in Russia in 1880. It developed and expanded, becoming ORT-Union in 1921 with headquarters in Berlin (hence the 'Verband'). By 1930 it was being increasingly controlled by the Soviet government. However, despite wars, revolutions and the Holocaust, it survived and is today a vast organisation assisting Jewish communities throughout the world.",
