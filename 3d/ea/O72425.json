The front is cast with a second relief inscription, also in Hebrew, and resting on top of this are eight lamps, all made in one. There is a shammash (servitor light) on the top left hand side of the backplate and there is a screw hole on the opposite side for an additional servitor light. The Hebrew inscription on the back plate is the prayer beginning Hanerot Halalu...,We kindle these lights on account of the miracles, the deliverances and the wonders which thou didst work for our fathers, by means of thy holy priests...) which is recited immediately after the blessing after the Hanukkah service, while the lamps are being lit. The inscription on the front plate, below the lamps, is an Halakic text on Hanukkah lamps.",
