Some designs depicted classical scenes while others were in the Pre-Raphaelite or Art Nouveau style. Decorative buttons complemented late nineteenth century women's fashions.\n\nMaterials and Making\nBy 1880 new industrial processes and cheap labour meant that manufacturers were able to produce an amazing variety of designs at affordable prices. This was also a period of experimentation and metal was widely used in combination with other materials.\n\nDesign and Designing\nThese buttons were probably quite expensive even though they are not made of solid silver.  This is because they would have taken a craftsman a long time to make.  Although the relief design has been cast, the metal in between has been pierced out by hand which was a lengthy and skilled process.\n\nOther\nT.92 E&F are much smaller and of a different design.  They probably do not belong to the same set as T.92 to D -1970,  which have the Registered number stamped on the back. T. 92 G is the box. There should be six buttons in the set so one is missing.",
