            "public_access_description": "Ernest Nister (1842-1909) began his publishing career in 1885 when he acquired a lithographic workshop in N\u00fcrnberg and printed books for London publishers. In 1888 he became a publisher in his own right with offices at 24 St. Bride Street, London. He appointed the writer and editor, Robert Ellice Mack, as director. \n\nNister specialised in high quality colour printing for children in the last quarter of the 19th century. Movable books with various mechanisms became his speciality after 1890 (when be published his first stand-up book) but he also produced numerous picture books, annuals, poetry, nursery rhymes, calendars and greetings cards. He worked with a core of writers, including Clifton Bingham and Robert Ellice Mack, and illustrators, in particular Eveline Lance, Lizzie Lawson, Harriett M. Bennett, Edith A. Cubitt and Rosa Petherick.\n\nThese two pen and ink drawings by Louis Wain were published in 1902 in All Sorts of Comical Cats, pictured by Louis Wain with verses by Clifton Bingham, and published in London by Ernest Nister and in New York by E. P. Dutton & Co. The drawings illustrate a hack poem by Clifton Bingham entitled 'The Flute Player':\n\nThomas Purr a flute had got,\nSat upon a chimney-pot,\nPlayed as well as he knew how,\n\"Take me home to mother now!\"\n\nMousie crept out from his hole:\nHe had music in his soul;\nThought he: \"I am charmed with that,\"\nSo upon Tom's flute he sat.\n\nCan you picture Tom's surprise?\nOpen wide went both his eyes;\nAll at once the music stopped,\nTom his precious new flute dropped.\nMoral: if you've got an ear\nFor sweet sounds - don't go too near.\n\nA third illustration by Wain appears in the published book depicting the mouse sitting on the end of the cat's flute.",
