This tableman is in whalebone ivory and representing a dragon-like quadruped. There are traces of light blue, green and red colour.\n\nThe game of tables, or backgammon, was popular in the 11th and 12th centuries. There were 15 counters to each side, and 12th century boards inlaid with bone sections have been excavated at Gloucester and Saint-Denis. About 250 Romanesque tablemen with figurative designs survive. The game was popular throughout Northern Europe and the pieces were made in a number of different centres, with the most productive workshops based in Northern France and Cologne.\nThey are to be found in most museums with archaeological collections and difficult to date because of their simple ornament and the unchanging nature of their design.\n\nThe collecting of rarities and curiosities, assembled to form 'a goodly large cabinet wherein whatsoever the hand of man by exquisite art or engine has made rare' was increasingly popular with the educated gentry from 1600 onwards. Such 'cabinets of curiosity' were frequently housed in a room set aside for the purpose. 'Cabinets' often contained small-scale carvings and similar Malines alabasters were found among the 'Artificialls' in John Tradescant's collection, together with 'rare and ancient pieces in ivory' similar to this gamespiece.",

About 250 Romanesque tablemen with figurative designs survive. The game was popular throughout Northern Europe and the pieces were made in a number of different centres, with the most productive workshops based in Northern France and Cologne\n\nRudimentary gaming pieces were made throughout Northern Europe in the 11th - 13th centuries. They are to be found in most museums with archaeological collections and difficult to date because of their simple ornament and the unchanging nature of their design.",
