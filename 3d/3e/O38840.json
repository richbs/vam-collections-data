The front shows four children and a black puppy, standing around an aquarium: one girl wears a red and white dress, and the other a blue pleated skirt and white and red blouse; one boy is in a yellow shirt and red shorts, and the other (partly visible from the inside) has blue dungarees (though no legs are shown) and a red shirt; the wording reads\nHAPPY DAYS !\nwith the words \n6 YEAR OLD visible inside to the right, with the enlarged figure six embossed and printed in gold, and with a illustration of a kitten beneath it.  Inside is an illustration of the boy in the blue dungarees standing on a river bank, while another boy, in wellingtons, brown trousers and a yellow jacket is fishing with a rod made from a stick; the verse reads:\nIT'S FUN TO WATCH THE GOLDFISH\nSWIMMING TO AND FRO,\nALL THEY DO IS NIBBLE\nAS ROUND AND ROUND THEY GO,\nI SUPPOSE THEY KNOW THAT YOU'RE SIX\nTHESE CLEVER LITTLE FISHES,\nAND IF THEY DO\nTHEY'LL JOIN WITH ME\nIN THESE HAPPY BIRTHDAY WISHES -\n\"Many, many Jolly Times !\"",
