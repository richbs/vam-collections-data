De Maar rarely photographs the inhabitants of these spaces but the rooms nevertheless are seen by the artist as portraits of those who live in them.  Personal belongings, and the evidence of  habits and daily necessities,  give shape to the character of the room and the person. \n\nIn most cases, De Maar gains admittance by going unannounced from door to door and showing a letter of introduction in the appropriate language.  With this method, she is able to catch authentic states of domestic interiors and not one that is a censured or a version presented for visitors.  Her images are made predominantly with available natural light and require long exposures. They share a sensibility with historic Dutch 'Golden Age' paintings of domestic interiors, but combine this with distinctly modern subjects and concerns. \n\nAcross cultural boundaries, desire for personal space seems to be universal. By dealing with the notion of home de Maar's images touch a common personal interest to which all viewers can relate.  The photographs  not only open the door to the private lives  of others but  also offer a possibility for reflecting on our own.",

They work on a year contract. Their employer gives them a place to sleep - often in tents on the buildingsite. He feeds them and takes care of some recreation, often a kind of open-air cinema. But mostly the work goes on day and night. Then - shortly before New Year - the workers get their pay and leave for their families in the countryside. They will return after a month, with or without a new contract.\nThe buildingcontractor went almost broke just before Christmas and the work on the housing compound stopped. As the workers hadnot fulfilled their years contract the owner and the bank argued that they need not get paid - not a penny. So there they were - lost in the city - no work, no money for going home, not even for food at that moment. Of course they got very angry and moved into the half finnished houses. The tents had been taken away from them. Some of the villa's were made into toilets - the shit houses. \nWhen we visited the compound in March it was still very cold and fortunately all the shit had frozen. It all looked like little heaps of left behind concrete, together with the unfinnished ceilings and rusty straircases.\nOne villa was packed in large sheets of building plastic. As we entered it was warm and cosey inside. Flowerpots were standing everywhere and we heard laughter upstairs.\nIn a kitchen a group of workers was eating, the women had cooked a good meal for them. They were the lucky ones. After a lot of conversations over the mobile phone I got permission to  take pictures. The house had been turned into a glasshouse for the plants that would be standing along the roads in summer. A part of the compound had been finnished earlier. Those houses had been sold or leased to foreigners and wealthy Chinese people. The foreign people had felt great pitty for the workers and had helped where they could. The gardner had got his Angel at a christmasparty, that the teachers from the international school had organized for them.\n- Marrigje de Maar",
