The series shows ladies's dresses designed by six leading Parisian couturiers of the time - Jeanne Paquin, Ernest Raudnitz, Madeleine Laferri\u00e8re, Gustav Beer, Jacques Doucet and the House of Rouff. Each lithograph is printed with its designer's facsimile signature.\n\nThis design was created by Gustav Beer of the house of Beer. Beer, whose couture house was the first such establishment to open on the Place Vend\u00f4me, was a German-born designer who moved to Paris in the late 19th century. He worked at various locations around Paris. Known for its elaborate gowns and luxurious lingerie, Beer merged with the house of Drecoll in 1929 to briefly become Drecoll-Beer, although in 1931, when Drecoll merged with Agnes to become Agnes-Drecoll, the name Beer was dropped.",

Many bear the stamp of Paquin's archivist at the time. They were acquired by the V&A in 1957 when, following the closure of the combined houses of Paquin and Worth, the Worth/Paquin archives and design books were donated to the Museum.",
