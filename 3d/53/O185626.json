She was a national deity in Egypt and in the Hellenistic age also acquired the status as a leading  goddess of the Mediterranean world. She was worshipped as the ideal mother and wife, and was the patron of nature and magic.\n\nA pylon is a massive, monumental gateway forming the entrance to an Egyptian temple.\nIt consists of a pair of towerlike structures with slanting walls flanking the entrance portal. The term may also be used more loosely for any large isolated structure used to mark a boundary like with approaches to bridges or avenues.",
