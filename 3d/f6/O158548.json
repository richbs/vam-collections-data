A long chevron patterned extension/tongue extends top and bottom.  Inside and outside the polygon the ground is covered by a net of needleweaving and inside the polygon there is a smaller version of the polygon motif with concentric rows of chevron, lozenge and 8-pointed star leaving a stylized cypress tree again in the needlewoven net in the centre.\nThe pattern of concentric rows is repeated in the 4-pointed corner units in two scales of stars, again with a small net section in the corner itself.\nThe whole is framed by a wide composite band of:\n[a] a row of needlewoven lozenges\n[b] a row of spaced hexagons of overcast net framed by concentric rows of small lozenges and 4-pointed stars; in between the hexagons, the triangular spaces are filled with stepped triangles in lozenge format in straight stitches.\nCotton thread: cannot determine twist.\nEmbroidery Thread: white silk; 2S\n\nBacking: plain weave magenta silk.\nFacing: bias cut pink satin.",
