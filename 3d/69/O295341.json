Most were worn by men, but in a few places in northern Germany women also wore them.  Women's buttons tend to be larger and more decorative than those worn by men.  They were mainly worn along the sleeves of the outer jacket, from the cuff to the elbow.\n\nThese buttons come from the Altes Land, where they were worn by women on the sleeves of their jackets.  They are similar in appearance to buttons from other countries around the North Sea, but the rows of coil rings, merging with each other, are typical of buttons from the Hamburg region.  Buttons of this design are rarely marked.",
