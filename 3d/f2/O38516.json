One of the major innovations in children's clothing in the early decades of the 20th century was the use of fabrics like this rayon which were lightweight but strong and easily washable.  Advances in textile production had also provided dyes which were more likely to be 'colour fast' so that their colours would not fade, nor present a streaked appearance when washed.",
