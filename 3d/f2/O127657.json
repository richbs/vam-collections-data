He received important commissions from private and public institutions such as the Royal Court in The Hague and the Clergy. \n\nThis painting is a copy of a now lost original painting even though some close compositions have survived. The story of Mercurius and Jupiter in the house of Philemon and Baucis is told in Ovid's Metamorphosis (VIII, 620-724) is a story of rewarded piety. Mercurius and Jupiter, disguised as men, seek refuge as strangers and only received it from an old couple Philemon and Baucis. As Jupiter wants to reward them, they only ask to be the guardians of his temple and when the time will come, to die together.",

This is a late copy of a composition by Jordaens engraved, in reverse, by Nicolas Lauwers (d. 1652) (<i>Jacob Jordaens</i>, exh. National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa, 1968-69, no. 303, repr.). According to R. A. D'Hulst (<i>De tekeningen van Jacob Jordaens</i>, Brussels, 1956, p. 260, no. 145) the original painting is in the Dresden Museum, but it is not listed in the Dresden catalogues. A very similar composition is in the Atheneum in Helsingfors (no. 405; 89.7 x 116 cm.), and a different treatment of the same subject by Jordaens in the North Carolina Museum of Art, Raleigh (Ottawa exh. no. 87, repr.). There are several other versions attributed to Jordaens or his followers (M. Rooses, <i>Jacob Jordaens</i>, 1908, p. 184). Jordaens' treatment of the subject, like that of other 17th century Flemish artists, derives from a Rubens composition which in turn is based on an engraving after Otto van Veen in the <i>Emblemata Horatiana</i> published at Antwerp in 1607 (W. Stechow, 'The myth of Philemon and Baucis in art' in <i>J. W. C. I.</i>, iv, 1940-41, p. 107 ff., pls. 26a-b). \n\nProv.

Bequeathed by Constantine Alexander Ionides, 1900\n\nHistorical significance: This painting is a late 18th-century copy after a well-known composition by Jacob Jordaens <i>Jupiter and Mercury visit Philemon and Baucis</i>, of which many copies and replicas were made. It was engraved (in reverse) by N. Lauwers (died 1652). \n\nThe earliest painted version of this composition may be that in the North Carolina Museum of Art, Raleigh (No. 52.9.99). This varies from the present composition; Mercury is seen from the front and not the back, Philemon is pouring wine and not offering fruit, while Jupiter reaches towards the glass. The Raleigh composition is also richer in details such as the cat resting on the right hand-side foreground, the sparks from the fire and the depiction of the beams of the ceiling.\n \nThe present painting is much closer to the engraving, and is presumably based on it. A canvas in the Atheneum, Helsinki (No. 405) depicts a similar composition to the V&A painting, with a slightly different background.\n\nJordaens was inspired for the treatment of this subject by a Rubens' composition which in turn is based on an engraving after Otto van Veen in the <i>Emblemata Horatiana</i> published in Antwerp in 1607 (W. Stechow, 'The myth of Philemon and Baucis in art' in <i>J. W. C. I.</i>, iv, 1940-41, p. 107 ff., pls. 26a-b).",

He was a pupil of Adam van Noort from 1607 and was accepted as a master in the Antwerp guild in 1615. He collaborated with Rubens on several large commissions and was much influenced by him. \n\nThe story of Mercury and Jupiter in the house of Philemon and Baucis, narrated in Ovid's <i>Metamorphosis</i> (VIII, 620-724), is a tale of rewarded piety.
