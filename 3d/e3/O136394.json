            "public_access_description": "At the start of the nineteenth century, the British market was flooded with a new range of printed cottons. These were used for clothing and furnishings, including the creation of light, bright coverings for the bedroom. Tailors and dressmakers capitalised on consumer demand by offering fragments, cuttings and ready-cut patches for use in patchwork and quilting. \n\nPrinted panels also became popular. These were manufactured throughout the first few decades of the century, and were widely used in domestic needlework projects.  Some celebrated military victories and coronations, but others were decorative examples that fitted with the trend for dense patterns and bright colours. The particularly large example at the centre of this bed cover was probably printed in the 1820s or early 1830s, at a time when the surrounding prints would also have been highly fashionable in middle class homes across Britain.",
