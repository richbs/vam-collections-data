Worked as a miniature painter by the age of nine. Moved to Edinburgh 1839/40, and studied at the RSA. Exhibited 40 works at the RA between 1855 and 1893, three at the SBA in 1879, but principally at the RSA: 234 works 1841-95 (elected ARSA 1847, RSA 1851). Early works were miniature portraits, then, in 1850s, subjects from Shakespeare, the Bible, Burns, Scott, and Scottish ballads, and also landscapes; achieved a considerable reputation by 1860. Founder member of the sketching club 'The Smashers', continued in London as 'Auld Lang Syne'. Toured Middle East 1857, moved to London 1864, retired to Gatehouse 1880. Studio sale at Christie's 11 June 1880. Several of his works were engraved. Died Gatehouse 22 October 1902. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1871, pp237-9; <i>Scotsman</i> 23 October 1902 (obit); <i>DNB</i>; Wood <i>Dict</i>; M McKerrow <i>The Faeds - A Biography</i> 1982 \n\n<b>The Great Hall at Haddon</b> \n104-1900 \nMillboard, 35.5 x 50.7 cm (14 x 20 ins) \nSigned and dated '.Faed 1860.' br \nPurchased 1900 \n\nHaddon Hall, Derbyshire, home of the Vernon family, now Dukes of Rutland, was principally built from 1370 onwards; the great Banqueting Hall, typically medieval in plan, is the oldest room of which the original structure is still substantially intact. Faed shows the entrance screen with the minstrels' gallery above (compare the photograph repr in the 1977 guide book, pl2, which shows almost the same view with some of the furniture in the same position). Because of features such as the castellated towers, the Picturesque aspect of Haddon Hall was much admired by painters, and - particularly in the 19th century - used inside and outside for backgrounds for pictures (see for example J C Horsley's 'Rival Performers', FA83 p129). In the artist's 1880 sale there were numerous sketches of Haddon; in his list of works, 'Haddon Hall in Old Times' is given under 1865 and as bought by the dealer Gambart for \u00a3250, and he exhibited 'Haddon Hall in the Olden Time' at the RSA in 1869. A painting identified as the 1865 work was sold at Sotheby's 16 April 1865 (199, as 'Haddon Hall in the Olden Time', 51 x 40.5 cm/20 x 16 ins, repr in catalogue); it shows an exterior scene with two figures in Romantic medieval costume. The present work may be a study for the background of another painting, and was presumably studied on the spot. The subject may have been inspired by books such as Baroness de Calabrella's <i>Evenings at Haddon Hall</i> (illustrated by George Cattermole) published in 1846. \n\nProv: The artist's sale, Christie's 11 June 1880 (138), bought White \u00a324 3s; Edward Fox White sale, Christie's 24 March 1900 (21), bought Agnew's for the museum \u00a37 17s 6\"",
