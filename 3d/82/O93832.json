The source for this medal is one of the two paintings by D\u00fcrer of his teacher Michael Wolgemut. One of these is in a private collection in South Germany; the other is in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg. The latter is dated 1516, and was originally in the Paul von Praun Kunstkabinett. \n\nMende believes the medal to date from the mid to late sixteenth century, and the date 1508 on the obverse to have been added so that it would be a pendant to the so-called Lucretia medal (inv. 4574-1857), also purporting to date from 1508. Mende dates the Lucretia medal to about 1530-40. However, the Lucretia medal is more likely to date from the early seventeenth century, during the so-called D\u00fcrer Renaissance. Therefore if the Wolgemut medal was made at the same time as it, this would suggest this medal too dates from the early seventeenth century.",

Mende believes the medal to date from the mid to late sixteenth century, and the date 1508 on the obverse to have been added so that it would be a pendant to the so-called Lucretia medal (inv. 4574-1857), also purporting to date from 1508. Mende dates the Lucretia medal to about 1530-40. However, the Lucretia medal is more likely to date from the early seventeenth century, during the so-called D\u00fcrer Renaissance. Therefore if the Wolgemut medal was made at the same time as it, this would suggest this medal too dates from the early seventeenth century.",
