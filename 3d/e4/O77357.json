This creates a range of velvety tones and white highlights when the image is printed on to paper.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThis mezzotint reproduces a painted portrait of Horace Walpole. He is shown leaning his head thoughtfully on one hand, with his elbow resting on a table. Also present in the picture are a pen and a row of books, artefacts associated with writers and men of letters. Walpole commissioned the print hanging over the edge of the table, showing an eagle. This eagle was one of Walpole's prized possessions, as it was an antique marble sculpture excavated near the Baths of Caracalla in Rome. Walpole purchased it in the mid -1740s, a few years after returning from visiting Italy on the Grand Tour.\n\nTrading\nThis print was a private plate. Instead of examples of the print being sold on the open market by either James McArdell or a printseller, they all became the property of the person who commissioned them, Horace Walpole. This meant that Walpole could control who got hold of the prints by distributing them to his friends and acquaintances as and when he saw fit.",
