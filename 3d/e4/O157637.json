This example originally held six implements: pair of nail scissors and two holders, probably intended for make-up sticks, remain.\n\nOutside the wealthiest court circles, 17th-century silver was used primarily for eating and drinking. The dining table was the heart of social activity, and novelty items were made for fashionable new drinks flavoured with spices and drinking games.  The range of British silver for the home from this period (the first for which a representative quantity survives) demonstrates increasing foreign influences from France, the Netherlands and Portugal. The rising demand for fashionably decorated European silver from the 1660s onwards reflects Britain\u2019s new wealth and political stability. \n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world\u2019s great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
