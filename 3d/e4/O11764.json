In each corner is an image of a devil in red (Germany), blue (Austria), green (Hungary) and yellow (Turkey); at the mouths is an appropriately coloured spot to match one of the coloured card discs.\nBetween these faces are four yellow blocks with black and white border - each has one name of the title.\nThe map is cut with seven holes of different sizes, placed in each of the countries (UK, France, Italy, Servia, Belgium, Hunland and Russia).\nThe outside of the box is covered with very dark red paper, the underside with plain paper stained with red and green ink; the glass is held in place and edged with passe partout.\n\nTHE OBJECT OF THE TOY\nThis is a maze puzzle and the object is to fill each of the seven cut out holes with some of the mercury while placing the appropriately coloured disc on the spot.",
