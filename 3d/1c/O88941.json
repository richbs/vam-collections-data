Mackmurdo was an architect and designer who was a founder member of the Century Guild in 1882 and of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society. He set up as an architect in 1875 and from 1885 to 1890 worked in partnership with Herbert Horne. Mackmurdo was also a friend of William Morris and C. F. A. Voysey.  \n\nMembers of the Century Guild designed decorative arts of various types such as textiles and upholstered furniture which were manufactured for them by outside firms, including Simpson & Godlee, a textile printing company. Much of this work was commissioned and sold through the Bond Street shop of Wilkinson & Sons.",
