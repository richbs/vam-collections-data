A pierced strip of metal is attached to the lower edge of the face, with seven pendant coral beads hanging from it.  The pin itself is split at the top to form a bar soldered across the back of the face, and is bent at right angles so that the face is parallel to the length of the pin.  There are the remains of a hinge on the back of the face at the bottom, behind the pierced strip, and a small tab at the top with a hole.  This suggests that the face was originally an earring, which has been converted to a pin by the removal of the hinged earring wire, and the addition of the pin.",

It was probably converted from an earring, when one of a pair was lost.  There are still traces of the earring fittings on the back, at the bottom, where there is part of the hinge which would have attached the wire, and at the top, where there is a small hole to catch the point. It clearly demonstrates that re-use of bits of old jewellery is not purely a modern phenomenon.\n\nIt comes from Sardinia, and was bought as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
