Here is depicted the city of Lausanne on the edges of the lake Leman in Switzerland. The artist combined here a town view with a landscape by depicting the Alps chain in the background. Bryner produced a few views of different Swiss cities, which he later engraved. The warm golden glow enlivened by pink and blue hues is characteristic of Bryner's palette.",

Chauncey Hare Townshend, 1868.\n\nHistorical significance: Bryner was a painter who specialised almost exclusively in views of the Swiss Alps and their surroundings. This painting is a fine example of a town view combined with a landscape, here the lake Leman and the distant chain of the Alps in the background. \nComparable compositions include two hand-coloured aquatint in the British Museum, London: <i>Chamouni et le Glacier des Bois</i> (1958,0712.1040) and <i>Vue de Fribourg & du pont en fil de fer</i> (1958,0712.949).",
