The following is the full text of the entry: 615 Salome delivering the head of St John the Baptist to Herodias Inscribed on the back in pencil 'Giov. And. Ansaldi' Pen and ink and wash heightened with white 8 1/8 x 13 3/4 (206 x 348) D.1027-1900 PROVENANCE Marquis de Lagoy (Lugt 1710); Dalton Bequest 1900 LITERATURE Dalton Catalogue, p. 15; Exhibition Catalogue, Mary Newcome, Genoese baroque drawings, University Art Gallery, Binghampton, and Worcester Art Museum, USA, 1972, no. 30 and pl. 30 Mary Newcome connects or compares the drawing with a painting of the same subject in the Palazzo Bianco, Genoa (her pl. 30a). In this work Herod, Herodias and Salome with the charger, fill most of the picture space, and dominate the whole composition, whereas in our drawing they occupy only about a third of the sheet on the left edge and are not very conspicuous actors in a crowded scene. The composition of the two works is thus totally different. The three principal actors perform the same motions in each, but the correspondence is not exact enough to prove beyond doubt that the painting is connected with the drawing. Yet certain similarities suggest that the same artist may have conceived both designs. The way Herodias leans forward towards the severed head as though intending to stab it with the knife that she holds in her right hand is a significant similarity between the drawing and the picture: so is the distant view of the beheading of the Baptist seen through a vista of classical architecture. A comparison with the picture thus provides some evidence in support of the old attribution to Ansaldi, who was hardly known as a draughtsman before the publication of Mary Newcome's catalogue. She cites some other drawings as further evidence, but they are hardly numerous enough as yet to give a very clear idea of Ansaldi as a draughtsman. It is worth recording an anonymous suggestion that our drawing is a late roth century Flemish work. The high pitched roof with a dormer window on the building seen through the central arch looks certainly more Flemish than Italian.",
