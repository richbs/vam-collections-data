He came from a large family of sculptors and bronze foundry men although he was by far the most successful.  De Levis specialised in ornamental artefacts such as bells, mortars, inkstands, door-knockers and firedogs. His works have been identified from the signature that he frequently cast on to his works: IOSEPH DE LEVIS IN VERONA MI FECE.  In addition to his signature, de Levis also often dated his works which has allowed around 30 works to be clearly attributed to him.\nThis door-knocker does not bear the usual signature / trademark in cartouche on the reverse, and thus Charles Avery suggests, the attribution could be doubtlful.",
