Monochrome glazed tiles with both figural and non-figural decoration were chiefly produced in Kashan, Iran during the 12th to 14th centuries. Although there were doubtless other potteries functioning in Iran in the medieval period, evidence of Kashan's preeminent position comes from finds of wasters (objects spoiled in the kiln) and the remains of kilns. Such tiles frequently have inscriptions in the cursive naskhi script around their borders that include Persian poetry and verses from the Qur'an.",

Although there were doubtless other potteries functioning in Iran in the medieval period, evidence of Kashan's preeminent position during this period comes from finds of wasters (objects spoiled in the kiln) and the remains of kilns. Most of the large number of surviving tiles from Kashan are monochrome in turquoise or blue, many with moulded decoration such as this example. Tiles produced throughout most of the 13th century are decorated with both figural and non-figural motifs. They frequently have inscriptions in the cursive naskhi script around their borders that include Persian poetry and verses from the Qur'an. Figural tiles were most likely destined for secular use in palaces, though some such tiles were used in Shiite shrines, where human love and poetry could be used as an allegory for divine love.",
