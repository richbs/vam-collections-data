Bristowe, <u>Victorian China Fairings</u>, London, 1971, ed.\n\nOf the factories making them by far the most prolific was Conta and Boehme of P\u00f6ssneck in Saxony. Founded in 1790 they specialised in small porcelain ares such as dolls' heads and, from about 1860, in fairground souvenirs of \"fairings'. Many, but not all, are impressed with a crooked arm, the hand grasping a dagger, within a shield. The subjects were supplied form England, possibly by F & S Salaman, 136 Fenchruch Street, London, beginning as early as 1855. The sources are popular prints, song sheets and cartoons and many have been identified. The majority are captioned but many are not; a few are captioned in German and French but the scarcity of these proves that it was the English market which was the most receptive. The subjects vary from the innocent (playing children or simple jokes) to the saucy (bedroom frolics or frankly suggestive); from social record such a working children and early bicyclists to caricatures of the law or politicians. At the far end of the range there are portraits of well-known characters, both fictional and non-fictional and of war events such as wounded soldiers or representations of the great powers, as in the bear and turkey group.",
