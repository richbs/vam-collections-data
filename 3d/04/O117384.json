His teachings were instrumental in the development of the early Christian church. Although he was not one of the original Apostles, Paul was later included among them \n\nPaul\u2019s real name was \u2018Saul\u2019. He had been an active and vicious opponent of the early Christian faith. In Acts he is recorded as approving the killing of St Stephen, the first Christian martyr, who was stoned to death.\n\nOn one of his missions to persecute the Christians, Saul was travelling by road to the city of Damascus. He was blinded by a brilliant blaze of light and God spoke to him, saying \u2018Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?\u2019. Saul\u2019s companions took him to Damascus, where his blindness was cured and he was converted to Christianity. He took the name \u2018Paul\u2019 at this point. This event is seen in the background of the panel, and Paul gestures towards it.\n\nThe style of the painting suggests that it was done by a Netherlandish artist. However, many artists from the Netherlands were working in England in the 17th century and their work influenced that of English glass painters.",
