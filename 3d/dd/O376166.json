If she did not have enough of her own, she borrowed from friends or relations.  Some of this jewellery was also worn later, on Sundays and feast days, but some pieces, like the bridal pendant, were only worn at the marriage.\n\nThe circular bridal pendant, on a long chain, was worn throughout Norway.  It had many names.  It was sometimes called an Agnus Dei, as the image of the Lamb of God appeared on many of them.  It was also often called a brudedaler, or bridal dollar, because many, like this one, were made from old silver coins.  The brudedaler usually consisted of one or three pendants, each of which might have smaller pendants of their own hanging from their lower edges.  The three small pendants on this brudedaler are made in the shape of a Gothic letter 'A', which stands for the first letter of the Latin prayer, 'Ave Maria'.  On their backs are engraved the letters 'A', 'H' and another illegible character, which are probably the initials of its original owner.  Although the coin on this pendant dates from the 17th century the pendant itself is more likely to have been made around 1800.  The heavy panzer chain is also consistent with this date.",
