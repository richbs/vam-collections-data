            "history_note": "These collage sketches, reproduced in \"The Magazine of Art\", had disappeared until a few years ago when the Theatre Museum acquired them.  The three sketches are made of small drawings cut out and pasted on to a plain background.  Dr. Richard Southern, working from the photographs in \"The Magazine of Art\", thought these fragments had been assembled wrongly and reconstructed them into two scenes - one ' a rocky country with a repaired bridge in the middle distance ' and the other ' a camp scene with the skycloth missing.'  Drawings of his reconstructions are reproduced in 'Shakespeare and the Artist', but further research is needed on these fragmentary sketches.\n\nDavid Garrick saw that de Loutherbourg 'had the sum-total of Continental scenic resources in his ken' and employed him as his designer at Drury Lane.  The innovations he brought to the theatre were the introduction of built pieces of scenery such as the bridge shown here and new methods of lighting the set with border battens so that the whole stage was lit, which meant that the actor was not forced to perform down stage in order to be seen.  He also invented machines for making sound effects such as the crack of thunder, the boom of cannon and the lapping of waves.  as a result he was the first to bring a kind of naturalism into the theatre.\n\nAlexander Schouvaloff\n1990\n\n\nThis set design was possibly executed for a production of William Shakespeare's play \"King Richard III\" (adapted by Colley Cibber) by David Garrick at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, London, 30th May 1772.",
