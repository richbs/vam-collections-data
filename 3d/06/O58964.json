Better suited to drawing-rooms than concert-halls, these were made fashionable by Edward Light (c. 1747 - 1832), who invented a number of harp-variants and taught music to Princess Charlotte (1796 - 1817), the only child of the Prince Regent. This unsigned and undated instrument is fitted with hand-operated 'ring-stops', which raise the bass strings by a semi-tone. It is also fitted with a stud at the bottom, which enabled the musician to use a shoulder-strap and play it like a guitar.",
