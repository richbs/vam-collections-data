The work is also named at the end as the Trailokya dipi, which is more usually applied to the Sangrahani Sutra of Jinabhadragani Kshamashramana, the earliest work of this class. The work is accompanied by an interlinear text in smaller devanagari script, which is possibly the commentary of Devabhadra. This manuscript is written on 56 oblong folios of paper of which two folios (10a and 12a) are not numbered, the last numbered folio being 54. The outer folios are of double thickness and decorated with a central ogee medallion and floral motifs on their outer faces. The copy is undated but appears to have been written and illustrated in Western India during the 18th century.\nThis folio recto has illustrations of the animal <i>vahanas</i> (vehicles) of celestial bodies. The top line has 5 elephants, the first of which is depicted with stripes and claws like a tiger, alternating with 5 horses with red and yellow saddles and bridles. The middle line shows 3 suns and 2 moons, one full and the other partially occluded. The bottom line has 5 elephants alternating with 5 bullocks.",
