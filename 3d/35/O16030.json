It was made at Vizagapatam, a port on the east coast of India famous for its fine cabinet work.  The maker has decorated the face of the cabinet with a combination of ivory inlay and ivory veneer in a style of the 1750s. From 1760 to 1780 was a period of transition between the two techniques practised by Vizagapatam workshops.  The use of ivory veneer gave makers a greater degree of flexibility. They could decorate more freely and easily by engraving on ivory than by inlaying ivory into a wooden ground. A major innovation in decoration was the introduction of figurative scenes and architectural views engraved on ivory. There are examples on the central group of compartments and the interior drawers of the cabinet.  These images are frequently fantastical. However, they were originally inspired by European prints from illustrated volumes. These are prominently listed in inventories of the time of the British in India and they were regularly advertised for sale in newspapers.",
