'Fuck the draft', is perhaps the most iconic of all. Designed by student activist Kiyoshi Kuromiya, the poster protests against the drafting of young men into the military to fight in the conflict with Vietnam. The drafting of men became a major catalyst for opposition to the Vietnam War, especially among college students and burning the draft card became a symbolic act of defiance. \n\nThe language Kuromiya used in the poster was designed to shock the establishment and resonates with the ways in which 1960s American youth culture sought to challenge authority through alternative politics, lifestyles, fashion and music. In 1968, Kuromiya distributed the poster via mail order. In the accompanying advert it said 'the perfect gift for Mother's Day' and 'Buy five and we'll send a sixth one to the mother of your choice' listing a number of places including the White House. For this ad, Kuromiya was arrested by the FBI for using the US postal service for inciting lewd and indecent materials. Later that year Kuromiya handed out 2000 of the posters at the Democratic Convention in Chicago.",
