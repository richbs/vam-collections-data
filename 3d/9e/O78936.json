The acorn finials beneath the front columns on the hood suggest that the clock was originally designed to be hung on a wall, but was later adapted as a long-case clock. The present pendulum is only 7 inches long.\n\nPeople\nThere were three clockmakers with the name of  Ahasuerus Fromanteel working in London from 1630 onwards. This is probably the work of the second,  who became a Freeman of the Clockmakers' Company in 1655.  His family were of Flemish origin and had settled in East Anglia in the 16th century.\n\nDesign & Designing\nAhasuerus Fromanteel introduced the use of the pendulum for clockwork to Britain. He learned of the development through his son John, who worked for eight months in 1657-1658 with the clockmaker Salomon Coster in The Hague. Coster had obtained the rights for the pendulum from Huygens.",

The clock had passed through his hands ten years earlier and he recalls certain repairs & replacements and some details of provenance.  He agrees with the possibility of its having started out as a hanging clock.  This letter appears to be a response to an enquiry but no such enquiry is on file in the R.P.\n\nCONDITION ASSESSMENT BY FRANCIS BRODIE ON SERVICING THE CLOCK 21/05/08\nThe Fromanteel clock appeared in good condition.  The metalwork side of it was clean and bright and not particularly dusty.  Obviously with a clock of this date there is some wear to components, but I did not see any serious, abnormal wear.  The oil in the bearings appeared reasonably clean but with some darkening in places, but nothing out of the ordinary for a running clock.  The lines on which the weights run appeared to be sound without fraying.  The movement's functions appeared normal.\n\nI wiped out oil from accessible bearings and those that showed discoloration, carrying out a small amount of dismantling to improve access.  All bearings were sparingly re-oiled with \"Moebius D4\" lubricant, a clock oil designed to lessen wear on loaded components.\n\nI would have thought that the clock ought to be looked at again in not less than two years hence.  A bit more dismantling ought to be carried out to improve access to some components, so I would have thought the work should be carried out not right by the clock; a reasonably sized table in somewhere quiet would suffice, and the work would not be that much more time consuming than this recent service.",
