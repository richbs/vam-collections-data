The panels shows the first stage, after the damp leather has been pressed into a mould to create relief decoration. This series of panels were made in about 1855 by the French firm of Jean Michel Dulud, who specialized in this technique.  They often used historic styles which were particularly fashionable at the time.  This design of curving, scrolling branches, was based on Gothic designs of the medieval period.  The Metropolitan Museum in New York has a chair of about 1850 (inventory number 1995.164) by the French furniture maker Jeanselme, which uses exactly this pattern of leather for the upholstery.",
