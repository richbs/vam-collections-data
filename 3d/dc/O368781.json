            "physical_description": "Summary description\nRectangular oak casket of boarded construction, with hinged rounded lid, covered in cut and embossed leather, and with ironwork mounts, handles and lock.\n\nStructural description\nThe body of the casket is constructed from 5 wood boards (all oak where visible), the front and back lapped over the sides, and nailed. The bottom appears to be nailed up into the front, back and sides. The lid is formed from one piece of cut-out oak, with curved 'gable' sections nailed under each end. The externior is covered with leather glued down, over which iron bands have been nailed. It is not clear whether the boards are held by nails hidden by the mounts, or by the same nails used to fix the mounts.\n\nIronwork\nThe casket is fitted with an ironwork lock and hasp. On the front, back, sides and lid are half-round ironwork mounts formed by flat strap that has been curved on itself, flatter at the hinges, lock-hasp and where the bands run under the bottom of the casket. The lid and both sides are fitted with a bale handle of flattened M form; the lid handle has two flower head 'washers' where it is fitted into the lid. \n\nLeatherwork\nOn the bottom the leather is plain. On the front, back, sides and lid the leather is embossed, carved and incised, with a spiky leaf pattern surrounding blank discs with a central pin-hole. Two of these discs, on the back, are incised with a fleur-de-lis within a lozenge, decoration which appears to be a later addition. Along the centre and at both ends of the lid, and at the right end, are bands with parallel 'ladder' hatching. The interior of the casket is covered with glued-down red leather(?), that must predate 1855. (The red leather is mainly missing from the lid, except for fragments and may have been removed to allow repairs to the lid mounts.)\n\nSummary of damage and later interventions\nThe lock appears to be a later replacement. Some round-headed screws replace missing nails. The hinges and hasp may have been repaired. Much of the red lining to the lid is missing. The incised fleur-de-lis ornament may be later addition.",
