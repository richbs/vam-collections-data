A butterfly collar is tied on the bodice. At the bottom, the designer noted, in pencil, the fabrics out of which the dress was intended to be made and special features of the design.\n\nThe design is signed \u2018M.F.\u2019 for Marjorie Field therefore before she signed her designs \u2018Marjorie Field Rhoades\u2019 after her marriage to Mr Rhoades in 1945. This design was amongst other designs in a folder marked 'Marjorie Field Rhoades' and 'Matita'. There is an advertisement for the Matita label in Vogue, June, 1941, p.13 which shows that this early design is likely to be for Matita even at this early date. The inscription on this design: \u2018Line a jacket or short coat with spotted or printed crepe \u2013 from the skirt of an old summer dress. The bodice will make a blouse.\u2019 shows the reuse of old fabric and thus the economic use of material. This reuse of a textile is in the spirit of 'Make-do-and- Mend' which was an ideal that was established during the Second World War (1939-1945). This design is therefore likely to be an early design drawn during the Second World War and may be dated 1941-1945.",
