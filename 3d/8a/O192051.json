            "public_access_description": "In 1988, when Mikhail Gorbachev\u2019s \u2018perestroika\u2019 (restructuring) policy was gaining momentum, the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic state publisher Mintis announced a political poster competition. Many artists participated. The first prize was awarded to this poster \u2018Skorosshivatel\u2019 by Jokubas Zove on the theme of the Nazi-Soviet Pact and the Soviet occupation of the Baltic States\n\nBefore the Second World War Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union had agreed their spheres of interest in Eastern Europe in secret protocols to the Nazi-Soviet Pact. Latvia, Estonia and, later, Lithuania were assigned to the Soviet sphere of interest and were consequently occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940.  The three Baltic States were forced to accept huge garrisons of the Red Army. After a year their governments were liquidated and pro-Soviet communist governments were installed in their place, which immediately \u2018requested\u2019 the USSR to accept the countries as members of the union. The independent states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia ceased to exist and Soviet occupation lasted until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.  \n\nThe poster is based on a complex metaphor \u2013 but one that was readily understandable to Lithuanian citizens at the time. Skorosshivatel is a Russian term for a document binder and is literally translated as \u2018sewing quickly together\u2019. The round rings of the binder drawn by the artist form the letters CCCP (the Russian initials for the USSR). Like a predator\u2019s teeth, the rings pierce unmercifully through the territories of the independent Baltic States, marked by their national flags, binding them quickly and firmly to the USSR.\n\n The poster was drawn with a pencil and coloured with gouache. It was printed in a large edition and was very popular. It was posted in public spaces, carried during demonstrations, reproduced in the press and shown on television. \n \nThe artist Jokubas Zove (b. 1948) graduated from the Graphic Arts Department of the Lithuanian State Art Institute in 1976. He worked for publishing houses, illustrated books and participated in exhibitions in Lithuania and abroad. He has received particular acclaim for his calligraphic work. He currently  works as an artist-designer for the National Martynas Ma\u017evydas Library.",
