Tourists loved to buy coral jewellery in fashionable shapes, but it was also very popular with Italian women, who valued it for its colour and amuletic qualities.  Coral branches were often left in a natural state for amulets, but beads for necklaces were always shaped.  \n\nThe protective value of this necklace is augmented by its pendant amulet.  Amulets shaped like a twisted horn were worn throughout southern Italy to guard against the evil eye.  Most were made of gold or coral, but the dark stone of this amulet may have had particular meaning for its owner.\n\nThis necklace was bought for \u00a32 8s. as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
