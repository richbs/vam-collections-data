He made his first professional appearance as Marcelli in The Devil's Bridge at the English Opera House in July 1815, and in September that year at Drury Lane Theatre as Lissardo in The Wonder.  He went on to play leading comic roles in operas, succeeding to the types of parts previously played by his friend John Bannister. Harley joined the company at the St. James Theatre in December 1835 when the theatre was opened by John Braham.\n\nThe Strange Gentleman was Dickens' first play, based on his sketch The Whinglebury Duel and  produced at the St. James\u2019s Theatre on 29 September 1836. Although Harley's performance was well-received, it is clear from Dickens' later correspondence that he regretted his early dramatic forays at the St. James's Theatre, including The Strange Gentleman.",
