GHF was centrally funded and remained a semi-autonomous body attached to various departments until 1999 when it became a section within the Foreign and Commonwealth office.\n\nThe GHF cutlery and tableware has seen service at important government functions throughout the 20th century. Collectively known as the State Dinner Service, this piece was part of 19,500 items of silver, porcelain, glass and linen still in use today, for official ministerial hosted lunches or dinners. It is looked after by the Government Butlers at Lancaster House, and only used when there is a Butler to supervise and run the event, at Lancaster House, Downing Street, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Admiralty House and No 1 Carlton Gardens. It has also been used at Chequers, to host President Yeltsin in 1994, President Chirac in 1995, and at Cardiff Castle in 1998 when HM the Queen hosted a dinner for the European Council.",
