            "public_access_description": "The pale colour palette and restrained decoration of this waistcoat are typical of the Neo-Classical style, which dominated textile design as well as other artistic media during the 1790s. The pink of the silk is paler than the vibrant rose-pinks of earlier garments. Gone are the curvilinear Rococo meanders and sprays of naturalistic flowers, replaced by straight lines and more stylised floral motifs. The scale of these new fashionable patterns is much smaller. A zig-zag of tambouring (chain stitching done with a hook instead of a needle) adds a little movement in this design, while a gentle twist of almost abstract flowers and leaves edges the front and lower hem.\n\nThe style of the waistcoat had changed considerably by the 1790s. A rectangular placket replaced the curving pocket flap and the waistcoat was cut straight across at the lower hem, eliminating the skirts seen previously.",
