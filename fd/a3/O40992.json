Drury trained at the National Art  Training School (later the Royal College of Art) under Jules Dalou and then worked as Dalou's assistant in Paris from 1881 - 1885. Dalou was working on the figures for the Monument to the Third Republic from 1881 to 1889. The robe of the crowning figure of this group, and the head of the female figure on the left at the base are particularly close to the corresponding features on the present statuette.\n\nIncluded in Christie's Nineteenth Century Sale, London, 29 September 1988, lot 272. Purchased from Richard Coats, London, in 1991 for \u00a31500.",
