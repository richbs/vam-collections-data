Most theatres and some circuses in the 19th century had some made to mark grand openings or milestone performances. By the end of the First World War however the practice had generally died out, only being revived very occasionally, more often at London's opera houses than any other theatres.\n\nThis silk programme with its images of some circus acts celebrates an opening of Ginnett's Circus owned by John Frederick Ginnett (1852-1892) after the death of his father in 1861. Known as Frederick, he was the eldest son of Jean Pierre Ginnett (1797-1861), the founder of the circus in the 1840s. A talented equestrian from an early age, John Frederick first appeared as an infant prodigy at Astley's Amphitheatre in December 1830. By 1851 he was director of Franconi's Cirque National, before running the family circus with great success. The images on this silk programme are probably those of Frederick Ginnett with his first wife, the equestrienne Sarah Savage, and their three sons, Frederick, Claude and Albert.",
