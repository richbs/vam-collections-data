Ballet dress with boned, low-waisted bodice of pale lilac dupion.  The wide neckline, boldly scalloped low waistline and front and back centre panels are outlined by a band of gold brocade, densely scattered with florets of white plastic lilac interspersed with sequins; the centre front panel is filled with shirred pale yellow nylon chiffon, randomly scattered with silver and iridescent sequins; on the back bands, at the shoulder blades, are small wings of shaped wire covered with shot iridescent crystal organza, each with an applique spot of coarse silver gauze.  The very full skirt ends above the knee, and consists of a top layer of grey-mauve fine net, and two inner layers of pale straw fine net beneath which are tiny frilled pantalettes.  The innermost skirt has a serrated edged, a middle skirt bordered with matt silver lurex lace and scattered with decorative iridescent plastic motifs; the top skirt has a serrated edge cut to reveal the silver lurex lace on the underskirt, and scattered with silver sequins.  The dress is shaped by two pads of foam rubber, extending from the waist to the top of the skirt and, on the hips, by broad net and crin hip pads.  The costume fastens at the back with hooks and eyes and has eyelet holes and lacing.",

The music for the ballet was composed by Tchaikovsky.  This new production, staged by Peter Wright,  was a deliberate attempt to give the ballet a different 'look' from the famous former production designed by Oliver Messel.  New and additional choreography was provided by Frederick Ashton, and the 'Medieval' style sets and costumes were designed by Henry Bardon, Lila de Nobili and Rostislav Doboujinsky.  The production was not considered a success, and was replaced by a new production by Kenneth MacMillan in 1973.",
