The Duke is sat behind the Duchess with his right arm behind her, his left hand outstretched on his leg. The Duchess sits with both hands neatly placed in her lap. Hanging at each side are drapes of a luxurious fabric with tasselled edges and the back-drop is formed by two lengths of floral fabric hanging vertically. They are lit from both sides with a stronger light illuminating the area behind their heads. This light creates a highlight on the back of the Duke's head and on the Duchess's neck, it also defines both their profiles.The Duchess is wearing a dress with a high neck and buttons down the front. She also wears a brooch, a small hat with feathers or fur attached and fine net gathered at the side, a diamond bracelet and a ring with a large rectangular stone.The Duke wears a morning suit with a white shirt and tie, he has a carnation in his button hole and a handkerchief popping out of his pocket. He also has a wide band on his little finger. There is a silver sheen around the edges of the print and it is mounted in a black frame.",

His style was inspired by figures such as E.O. Hoppe, Edward Steichen and  Baron de Meyer, the most successful magazine photographers of the 1910s and 1920s. Beaton's fascination with glamour and high society prevailed throughout his life and in 1937 he became the court photographer to the British Royal Family. He also became a successful stage and costume designer, most notably for 'My Fair Lady' and 'Gigi'.\n\nThis photograph was taken on 3rd June1937 on the occasion of the marriage of the Duke of Windsor and Wallis Simpson at Chateau de Cande, where Beaton was the official photographer. Wallis Simpson wears a blue silk crepe two-piece gown designed by the American designer Mainbocher and a hat made by Reboux.",

            "bibliography": "Apollo Magazine, February 2007\nBeaton launched his career as a 'society' photographer in 1926 with an exhibition in London which won him an immediate contract with Vogue magazine, where he worked for the next thirty years. His style was inspired by figures such as Emil Otto. Hoppe, Edward Steichen and Baron de Meyer, the most successful magazine photographers of the 1910s and 1920s. Beaton was always interested in glamour and high society and in 1937 became the court photographer to the British Royal Family. This photograph was taken on 3 June 1937, on the occasion of the marriage of the Duke of Windsor and Wallis Simpson at Chateau de Cand\u00e9, where Beaton was the official photographer. Wallis Simpson wears a blue silk crepe two-piece gown designed by the American designer Mainbocher and a hat made by Reboux. The V&A holds many of Beaton's Royal Portraits.",
