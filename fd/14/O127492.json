His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nGr\u00e9try\u2019s Z\u00e9mire et Azor (1771) is based La Chaus\u00e9e\u2019s comedy, Amour par amour (1742), a variant on Charles Perrault\u2019s fairy tale Beauty and the Beast (1697).  Messel\u2019s production was first performed at the Bath Festival at the Theatre Royal in 1955.   His colourful, elegant and fantastic costumes and sets complement the otherworldliness of the story.\n\nAn ink and wash design for the cut cloth, gauze and front cloth for Azor\u2019s palace.   Messel\u2019s sets received critical praise for their fantasy and invention \u2018The production \u2026 is marvellously ingenious, and turns the smallness of the stage to positive advantage.  Oliver Messel\u2019s d\u00e9cor has a Cocteau-like whimsy, and Sir Thomas nearly deceives us into mistaking the tinselly patches in the score for pure gold\u2019  (Daily Telegraph, 12 May 1955)",

Oliver Messel\u2019s production was first performed at the Bath Festival, Theatre Royal, Bath on 11 May 1955.  It was directed by Anthony Besch with choreography by William Chappel and featured Huguette Boulangeot as Z\u00e9mire and Michael S\u00e9n\u00e9cal as Azor.  \nLord Snowdon, Oliver Messel's nephew, inherited Messel's theatre designs and other designs and artefacts.  The designs were briefly stored in a disused chapel in Kensington Palace before being housed at the V&A from 1981 on indefinite loan.  The V&A Theatre Museum purchased the Oliver Messel collection from Lord Snowdon in 2005.",
