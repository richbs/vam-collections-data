            "history_note": "Together with another example in the collection (E.1030-1918), this study is one of the few documented self-portraits of Fuseli. There are various drawings depicting his hands, but one finds only few examples of self-portraits in his work (Schiff nos. 569, 570, 571 (?), 1743; Powell no. 23). According to his biographer John Knowles, he was well aware of his 'unheroic' appearance being only 5'2\" tall (Lindsay 1986, 483). By contrast, he was known for his witty character and unconventional and eccentric behaviour. In this drawing Fuseli sketches his face in a strong close-up, which enhances the intimacy and psychological depth of the drawing (Tscherny 1987, 195). Most notably, 'this device of placing the head close to the picture plane, appears often in the work of Fuseli and his circle (Barry, John Runciman, and John Brown) and became extremely common in Romantic portraiture, in the work of Reynolds's immediate successors (Romney and Lawrence) and into the nineteenth century (for example, in G\u00e9ricault's portraits of the insane)' (Tscherny 1987, 199).\n\nE.1028-1918 and E.1030-1918 are exceptional examples of full-face studies that are finished to a high degree of elaboration and detail showing Fuseli in a psychologically intimate context. A comparable self-portrait, although less elaborate, in the National Portrait Gallery (Schiff no. 1743, p.555) shows Fuseli half-length leaning over a book. Furthermore, the drawings are extraordinary in terms of their technical execution, as Fuseli is known to hardly heighten his drawings with white although this was common practice among artists of this period. Also, he preferred pencil and most often pen to working in chalk (Powell 1951, 28). His drawings are mostly executed in an expressive, impatient manner, rather 'rhethorical and declamatory' than 'diligent and persuasive' (Myrone 2001, 27).\n\n\n\n<b>Textual references</b> \nNAL no. 38.JJ.23\nPowell, Nicolas.
