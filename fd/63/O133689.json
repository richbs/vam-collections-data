            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of British Oil Paintings 1820-1860</i>, Ronald Parkinson, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1990, p. 259\nThe following is the full text of the catalogue entry:\n\n\"<b>SEVERN, Joseph</b> (1793-1879) \nBorn Hoxton, London, 7 December 1793, son of a musician. Apprenticed to engraver William Bond; at early age 'began to find some solace in the study of literature' (<u>Sharp</u>, p7). Studied at RA Schools, won gold medal for historical painting (first awarded for 12 years) 1818. Exhibited 53 works at the RA between 1819 and 1857, and nine at the Br 1825-43: portraits, Italian genre, literary and biblical subjects. Most famous for his friendship with the poet John Keats, whom he accompanied to Italy 1820 and nursed until his death 1821. Lived mostly in Rome, appointed British Consul 1860-72. Died Rome 3 August 1879, eventually buried next to Keats. His children Arthur and Waiter Severn, and Ann Mary Newton, were also artists. \n\nLIT: W Sharp <u>The Life and Letters of Joseph Severn</u> 1892; S Birkenhead<u> Against Oblivion: The Life of Joseph Severn</u> 1943; S Birkenhead <u>Illustrious Friends: the story of Joseph Severn and his son Arthur </u>1965 \n\n<b>Scene From Pope's 'Eloisa to Abelard' </b>\n1400-1869 Neg GA589 \nCanvas, 48.2 X 33 cm (19 X 13 ins) \nTownshend Bequest 1869 \n\nThe work does not seem to have been exhibited, and is not mentioned in Sharp's biography. \nAlexander Pope's poem based on the history of the 12th-century lovers Abelard and Heloise was first published in 1717. Severn's painting does not appear to be an illustration of the poem, which is in the form of a rhapsodic letter by Eloisa after she and her lover had entered separate religious orders. The picture shows Abelard's final farewell to Eloisa, and might refer to lines 107-116: \n\nCanst thou forget that sad, that solemn day, \nWhen victims at yon altar's foot we lay? \n. . . Yet then, to those dread altars as I drew, \nNot on the Cross my eyes were fix'd, but you. \n\nA highly Romantic subject, particularly in the light of the artist's close friendship with Keats (although the poet did not especially admire Pope's work), perhaps intended to answer Pope's call in the last lines of the poem: \n\nSuch if there be, who loves so long, so well; \nLet him our sad, our tender story tell; \nThe well-sung woes will sooth my pensive ghost; \nHe best can paint 'em, who shall feel 'em most. \n\n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
