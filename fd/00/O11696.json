It belongs to a group of chairs (of three slightly different patterns) at Ham House in Surrey. In the 1670s and 1680s several 'Japan'd backstooles [chairs] with Cane bottomes [seats]' were inventoried in the house, together with numerous other pieces of japanned and lacquer furniture. These chairs were clearly highly valued, for they were placed in the Duchess of Lauderdale's private closet and in the Antechamber to the 'Queen's Bedchamber' (in the apartment set aside for a royal visit). The caned seats were covered with cushions in expensive silk or mohair, trimmed with silk and gold or silver fringe. \n\nThe maker has not been identified, but could prove to be the London upholsterer John Ridge. The decoration of a set of armchairs by Ridge at Holyroodhouse, Edinburgh, is reminiscent of the Ham House pieces.\n\nOn loan to Ham House.",

English; about 1670.\n\n10/8/49 letter from Mrs Tracey to Edwards\nexplains that the chair came from Ham House.  Her father-in-law, the late Lord Sudeley, was Lord Dysart's first cousin and was brought up at Ham and married there.  She writes about a black lacquer chair and believes it is one of 12, the other 11 still at Ham.  Mrs Tracey offers to tell the story of how the chair came into her possession upon meeting Mr Edwards.  She would like to sell it and wants it to go back to Ham.\n\n17 August 1949 letter, Laver to Mrs Tracey\nstates that the chair is in very indifferent condition and there are already eight of these chairs; several in excellent preservation at Ham.  He does not feel justified in giving more than \u00a325 for it.\n\n26 August 1949 letter, Mrs Tracey to Laver\naccepts the offer of \u00a325 as she is anxious that the chair should go back to Ham House.  She enquires when she might visit Ham; she stayed there often in Lord Dysart's time.\n\n2\tSeptember 1949 letter in response\nthanks Mrs Tracey for enabling the return of the chair to its original home and advises her that the house is not yet open to visitors.",

A set of three chairs and two armchairs at Holyroodhouse (RCIN 27917.1\u20133; 27931.1\u20132) have japanned front stretchers of similar flat form and elaborately shaped outline to the components of these chairs. The Holyrood chairs have been associated with John Ridge\u2019s 1682 account for a japanned suite supplied for the Duchess of Hamilton (Margaret Swain, \u2018The State Beds at Holyroodhouse\u2019 (1978), p. 59; <i>DEFM</i>, pp. 746\u201347; Ian Gow, <i>Holyroodhouse</i> (1995), pp. 18\u201319 (ill.); Adam Bowett, <i>English Furniture</i> (2002), pl. 5:14)",
