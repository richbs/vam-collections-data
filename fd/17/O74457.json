This watercolour dates from his last visit to his friend John Fisher, who lived in Salisbury, England.\nOld Sarum (from the Roman name for Salisbury) had fallen into decay by the 16th century. It was therefore a popular subject with artists who wanted to paint ruined or wild landscapes. These were favourite subjects with artists  during the 'picturesque' period of the late 1700s. They were also popular with artists of the 'Romantic' movement of the early 19th century, when Constable painted this picture.",

ISBN: 0642541566.\nExhibition catalogue\nGraham Reynolds, <u>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</u>, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, pp. 215, 216\nThe following is an extract from the text of the entry:\n\n\"Isabel Constable Bequest. \nThis water-colour is one of five works bequeathed to the Museum in 1888 by Miss Isabel Constable with the request that they should be described as a gift from Maria Louisa Constable, Isabel Constable and Lionel Bicknell Constable. A strip about 37 mm. (1 1/2 ins.) wide has been added to the right-hand side to enlarge the surface to its present size. The paper is laid on an old mount which is watermarked: J WHATMAN 1830 and has a gilt line round the drawing. No. 395 [1629-1888] is mounted in similar fashion, and this was probably the original arrangement. \n\nAlthough the fact is not recorded in the documents leading to the bequest, there can hardly be any doubt that this drawing is, as noted by Holmes, p. 251, the one exhibited by Constable at the Royal Academy in 1834, under the title 'The Mound of the City of Old Sarum, from the south'. Leslie (L. ed. S., p. 313) records that this exhibit was a water-colour. The size, ambitious Scope and detailed handling of No. 359 [1628-1888] all go to establish that it was an exhibition drawing, and no variant which might dispute the claim with this one is recorded. No. 395 [1628-1888], as has already been noted, is mounted in the same fashion, and is almost certainly the exhibited water-colour of 1836, since it bears on the old mount the quotation with which it was listed in the catalogue. \n\nFor an earlier version in oils, the history of the composition, and its significance for Constable, see No. 322 [163-1888].\"\nEvans, M., with N.
