The sculptor Mary Grant (1831-1908) was based in Scotland, and exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1866 to 1892, but this is the only known work by her in ivory. This bust could have been carved posthumously as a memorial to the sitter. A marble bust of the same subject by William Theed dated 1877 is in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge.\nThe sitter founded the Westminster Training School and Home for Nurses in 1874. She was lady-in-waiting to the Duchess of Kent, and wife to Arthur Penrhyn Stanley (1815-1881), Dean of Westminster, whose memorial Mary Grant was also to execute for the private Royal Chapel at Windsor in 1884. The sculptor Grant was Lady Stanley's niece, and carved at least two different marble busts of her.",
