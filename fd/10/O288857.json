The pattern is outlined with a raised edging, worked overlaid threads and decorated with picots along the lower edge and in some central areas. A variety of fine decorative meshes are used to ground the cartouches and larger motifs including the large-scale filling called 'Argentella'.\n\nThe damaged upper edge is attached to a 19th-century bobbin made heading, but the original edge is visible in one of two places on the back.\n\nRepeating pattern of a large kidney-shaped cartouche containing a bunch of grapes, alternating with a smaller irregularly-shaped cartouche containing an upside-down urn. The remaining area is filled with swirling sprays of exotic fruit and leaves. The lower, gently scalloped, edge is defined by leaves, flower heads and scrolls.\n\nAlthough technically a French lace, the exceptionally fine thread and the fillings suggest that the border was one of the pieces partly worked in Brussels.",
