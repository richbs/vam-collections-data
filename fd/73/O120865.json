The case top is made from softwood and oak planks, the case back is softwood planks painted black. The drawers are constructed from walnut, with softwood fronts and a purplewood veneer along their top edge. The front, sides and legs of the commode are entirely veneered with a complicated parquetry pattern, in kingwood. The marble slab is <i>campan m\u00e9lang\u00e9,</i> a French marble from the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es. \n\nThe commode has two short and two long drawers. The top two drawers are disguised as a long one, enclosed in a single brass frame with a blind escutcheon between them. The two lower drawers are also each enclosed in a brass frame, with matching escutcheons. \n\nTwo very distinctive gilt-brass mounts run up the length of the commode's front corner edges. These have cloven hoofs at their bases, a single flower and scroll at their tops, and a floral and foliate design along their length. The mounts play more than a purely decorative function: the front of the case is supported on their feet, resting on a curve on the inside face of the mount. \n\nAttached to each side of the commode is a large gilt-brass handle with a gilt-brass mount above it. Three gilt-brass acanthus leaves, two at the top and one at the bottom, adorn the outward-facing side of each back leg.\n\nThe drawer handles are twisted, with a mask at the centre of each. Each is attached to the commode via two rosettes, the rosettes of oak leaves and acorns. The central escutcheons are each flanked by two sphinxes. There are two additional escutcheons above the centre of the handle on each of the short drawers. These escutcheons are of a more simple design, with a floral, scrolling outline.\n\nThere is a gilt-brass mask in the centre of the apron, flanked on either side by horizontally-spreading sprays of flowers.",

The commode went on to become one of the most important and prominent objects in the 18th-century European interior. This is a very fine example of an early 18th-century French commode. Clearly made in an important Paris workshop, it is at the height of fashion for the 1710s - showcasing the geometric marquetry and marble top that were newly-fashionable in the period. The decorative elements on the commode were designed to have maximum effect on the room in which it was placed. The shimmering surfaces of the commode's marquetry would have been picked out by its elaborate and very finely chased mounts, resulting in a rich object that could have manipulated the effects of light and reflection in an early 18th-century French interior.",

John Jones was a military tailor who made his fortune outfitting the British army. When he died, he left the South Kensington Museum a very large collection of French 18th-century decorative and fine art, including an important group of furniture. \n\nThe commode's provenance before entering Jones' collection is not known, and it has not yet been firmly attributed to any particular cabinet-maker. Two historians have suggested that it may have been made in the workshop of Andre-Charles Boulle, cabinet-maker to Louis XIV, but there is no definitive evidence to support this.\n\nRegardless of whether or not it originated with Boulle, the commode was clearly made in an important Parisian workshop, as evidenced by the fineness of its construction, marquetry and mounts.",

            "historical_context_note": "The commode was a decorative form of furniture which developed in France in the late 17th-century.  Essentially a wide chest of drawers, commodes became one of the most prestigious and fashionable pieces of furniture in the 18th-century European interior. French commodes typically stood between windows, usually underneath a mirror. They would often have a marble top that matched the chimney-piece, and their sides were usually richly decorated with either marquetry or lacquer panels.\n\nThis commode is a very fine example of a type that started to be made in around 1710, in which a marble slab replaced a tradional marquetry top. The geometrical decoration on the commode would also have been high fashion in the early 18th-century - representing a trend away from floral marquetry.",
