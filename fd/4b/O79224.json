This was an enormous collection of metalwork, glass, ceramics and miniatures belonging to Ralph Bernal, a lawyer and MP. The sale by Christie, Manson and Woods took 32 days during which 4294 lots fetched nearly \u00a371,000. The Museum bought 730 lots including this chandelier for which it paid \u00a313. 10s.\n\nThe chandelier may be seen as one of those objects which heralded a change in direction in the Museum's collecting activities after the appointment of John Charles Robinson as Curator in 1853. Robinson was a prolific collector and persuaded the Museum's first director, Henry Cole, that historic works of art were as instructive to students as 'modern manufactures'. Under Robinson's guidance, some of the earliest purchases by the Museum included outstanding examples of European metalwork.\n\nHistorical significance: As a medieval brass chandelier this is a rare survivor. Brass and bronze utility wares, even ones as elaborate as this, were frequently melted down and re-fashioned. The presence of the angel finial suggests this chandelier was used in a religious setting, either a public church or a chapel in a large private house.",
