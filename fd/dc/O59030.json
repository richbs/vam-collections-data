They  probably came from a Japanese chest of of around 1620-1640.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe table top is partly made up from a drawer of a Japanese cabinet. The front of the table apron includes pieces of mother-of-pearl Namban lacquer, decorated with flowers and birds. (Namban, an export lacquer produced up until the 1620s, is characterised by its exotic manner of decoration that combines elements of Chinese, Korean and Gujurati work from India. It made extensive use of inlaid mother-of-pearl with gold and black lacquer.)  The scroll legs and reinforcing stretchers  are japanned (painted in imitation of oriental lacquer), and would have been made  in England.\n\nTime\nBy about 1660 Japanese cabinets were much prized by the English nobility, as was any  piece of furniture from a workshop in Western Europe that incorporated parts that originally came from Japanese furniture.\n\nPlace\nThis was almost certainly made for Robert Spencer, 2nd Earl of Sunderland (1641-1702), for his seat at Althorp, Northamptonshire. It is referred to in an inventory of 1746.",

The stretcher base of the table is fitted with a panel of very early export lacquer c.1600, and the main panels of the table\u2026.date from 1630.\n\n\u2026.The 1630 pieces\u2026carry the device of eight feathers in a ring, which we think is the mon, the heraldic deice, of the Inone family of Shimasa Province, near Tokyo.  This would add evidence to the suggestion that not all 'export' lacquers were made for export initially\".\n\nReport, Thornton to the Director\nthat \"such suites were par excellence the grand decorative ensemble of the period.  This one is most splendidly veneered with japanese lacquer that seems to me to be of the very highest quality\u2026short of raiding Ham\u2026.we cannot represent this important class of furniture from our own collection and I would therefore like to buy this, which must come from the Earl of Sunderland's period at Althorp.\n\nMost of the correspondence relates to negotiating a price, determining tax status and arranging for the reproduction of a 2nd candlestand to complete the set.\n\nHandwritten notes (Thornton?)\n\"it has probably been at Althorp since it was new, in which case it will have formed part of the furnishing of this house when it belonged to the Earl of Sunderland.  An inventory of 1746 refers to an \" (?) table\" which may well be the actual piece.  At that time and perhaps from the outset, it had a \"crimson damask toilet\"\u2026and one can imagine it perhaps standing as a very splendid feature of his countess' apartment\".",
