Its floor-show was written by the club's owner, Helen O'Brien, taking ideas from a wide range of sources, from popular song to Shakespeare; while based on the traditional showgirls, all leg and, at that time, topless, the references and wit of the designs of Ronald Cobb combined into a sophisticated entertainment.\nMany of the scenes involved the singing of a song while the girls paraded in costumes wittily illustrating the words.  This costume accompanied the song \"On the Wrong Side of the Tracks\", and represented various symbols of success - in this case a Rolls Royce.  Unusually for Cobb's designs in the age of toplessness, the design leaves the breasts part covered throughout.  The number plate g-string is an example of Cobb's 'invisible' g-string, a construction which dispensed with side fastenings  and was held in place by a stiffened wire curve, which fitted between the legs.",
