Pears was its transparent amber soap, which was developed and promoted as a great improvement on the harshness of contemporary soaps by the company's founder, Andrew Pears, at the turn of the 18th century.  In the mid-19th century, the company took on a new partner, Thomas J. Barratt to stave off fierce competition and to improve sales performance.  He devised a series of expensive and original publicity schemes, which involved reproducing celebrated paintings. Such 'artistic' advertising appeared in the UK in the 1880s. Barratt was particularly keen to use the work of Royal Academicians to add kudos and respectability to his product and so target middle-income customers. He also promoted art through the pages of Pears Annual (published 1890-1921, and price six pence until 1915). Presentation plates were given away as a separate package with the Annual. This image appeared on the cover of Pears' Annual in 1902. Pears bought the painting on which poster was based in November 1898.",
