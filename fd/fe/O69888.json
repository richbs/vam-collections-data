Her motifs include plant forms, industrial products, details from architecture and ironwork, and elements of historic Asian textiles, which are photographed, scanned into a computer, and manipulated digitally to achieve the desired scale and relative proportions. They are then transferred to screens with a larger than usual mesh, allowing the artist to print with viscous pigments, in this case oil paint. The result is a richer, more fluid and painterly, surface than one expects of a screenprint. Philanderer applies digital means to traditional ends, and demonstrates the way in which much contemporary art blurs the conventional boundaries between media such as printmaking and painting.",
