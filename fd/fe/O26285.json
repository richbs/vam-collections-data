Appoint one of the party to preside, whose duty it will be to read the description from the book; which office need not preclude his joining in the game.\nII  The party will then arrange themselves round the table, in the order in which they intend to play; and each is to be provided with a traveller, or marker.  Should there be more players than travellers provided, a thimble or small coin will answer the purpose of a marker.\nIII.  The first player is now to spin, and to place his traveller at the same number on the game as that turned up by the teetotum; when the description given in the book is to be read aloud.\nIV.  The remaining players are to follow in turn, and spin, and otherwise proceed as directed in Rule III, until it has gone entirely round; when the first is to spin again; and adding the number now turned up to his former number, he is to shift his traveller on the game accordingly.  The other players are to proceed in like manner, continuing until one of them arrives at No. 37 ( The British Metropolis), and thus wins the game.\nV.  Any player going beyond No. 37, must return back as many numbers as he has exceeded it.\nVI.  Two more more players may occupy the same number on the game, with detriment to each other.  It seems almost needless to say, that the directions to stop or spin again at certain numbers, are to be observed.\nVII.  Any player coming to a number with an asterisk (*) must proceed by the numbers with asterisks so long as they last, which will take them to India by way of the overland route - as Malta, Alexandria, Aden, Bombay.  The others will proceed by way of Sierra Leone, Ascension, St. Helena and the Cape.\n\nSome but not all the descriptions also have directions for play.  Each of the descriptions should be read out during the play by one player, however, sometimes this is changed to each player who lands on a certain place.\n\n*John Betts called London the metropolis of the British Empire.  Interestingly two routes to India are provided, one overland  via Alexandria which is mentioned as being important even though it is not a colony, and other via Sierra Leone and the Cape.  It is perhaps surprising to see how well informed and up-to-date  some of the comments are - disapproval of the selling of gunpowder and spirits to North American Indians and the fact that Newfoundland was `rediscovered' by Sebastian Cabot in 1496, for example.  With the booklet is an extensive catalogue of the other games and amusements issued by Betts.  Largely educational and including scriptural puzzles, mathematical, scientific and spelling games as well as a wide range of maps.\n\nRules placement: booklet",
