Probably from a series published annually, c.1861-c.1872.  Also sheets (4, one mutilated) of specimen topographical views and illustrations to songs with accompanying letterpress. \n<i>Each pattern-book (except</i> E.453) <i>with an outer cover lettered with number, title etc.  Lettered throughout with numbers, descriptive notes and prices. \nProcess engravings and letterpress.</i>               E.448-454A-D-1951 \n\nGiven by Mr. C. H. Perry \n\n<i>Note:</i> The donor stated in a letter accompanying his gift that \"Eglington was originator of the 'stock block' business.  He produced designs, which he engraved, selling electros therefrom at a reasonable price, thereby saving the printer a good deal of trouble and money.  In the nineties the business was taken over by C. H. Read, and by myself from him in 1902, the name I traded under for nearly 50 years\".\"",
