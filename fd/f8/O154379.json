The blade is a long expanse of silver; a tapered, curved surface like a long, sweeping beach at low tide. The edges have been kept raw, showing the marks left after piercing, bringing a texture and references to tides, currents and water. The handle is the waves, in theory making you get your hands dirty! A true response to pre-packed and processed fish, which arrives at the table in fish shapes, with no need for preparation. The server is functional, however. But, added to this function is the notion of play: it rocks and has a fish in a line which can dip in and out of the waves, so becoming a playful object which brings amusement to the table when someone has gone fishing!",
