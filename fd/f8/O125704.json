As a devotional piece, the scroll was created on Buddha's birthday, the eighth day of the fourth month (26 May) in 1784. \n\nThe scroll was produced collaboratively by two major artists of the time. The Buddha image was depicted by Ding Guanpeng in ink and colour in a meticulously descriptive style, while the Sutra text was transcribed in gold in regular script form by Liang Guozhi. Both artists served at the imperial court in the Qianlong reign (1735-1795) and were favoured by the emeperor. The emperor himself was a devoted Buddhist. On the first and fifteenth day of each month in his later years he would copy out this Sutra. It is most likely that the present scroll was commissioned by the emperor to celebrate Buddha's birthday in the palace. \n\nThe collecting seal at the top of the scroll suggests that the present work was in the imperial collection, before it went outside the imperial palace. Eventually at one point it was acquired by Mr Martin Buxton, a British Diplomat serving in China in the 1940s and 1950s. The V&A museum acquired the scroll from the Buxton family in 1970.",
