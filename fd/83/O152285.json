            "physical_description": "Plain weave cotton embroidered with silk in surface darning and running stitch, backed with plain weave cotton and faced with bias-cut silk.\nThere are many patches which disturb the pattern: it is an ogival lattice formed by large red leaves, each containing a stem of flowers and leaves.  The ground is black but much of the thread has decayed.  Within each segment is an ogival medallion with a white or yellow ground and a central green cypress tree between a standing woman on the left and a standing man on the right.  He wears a turban with a Safavid taj. There is a bird perched on the tree.  The segment in the top right hand corner is half white and half yellow. \nThe border has a green ground with a red meandering stem and black and red blossoms alternating with yellow and blue blossoms.\nEmbroidery threads: 2S silk: red, black, light blue, green, yellow and white.\nBacking: white cotton.\nFacing: dark blue silk.\n\nThere are many patches taken from other, later embroideries:\n[1] Top left hand corner, bottom left hand corner and bottom right hand corner: geometric designs in surface darning on the diagonal.  Colours: Silk, dark green, white, light blue, red, green, faded pink and black.\n[2] Upper central part of the field.  Large patch with a seated/kneeling figure of a male servant dressed in red with dark green  sleeves, a turban and a Safavid taj, offering a shallow bowel with 3 fruits. Below this and above to its right are smaller patches which may have been from the border of the textile with the servant.  The pattern appears to be two alternating lobed medallions: [a] blue ground with red outline containing a left-facing animal in cream - this only appears once although the edge of the roundel appears more often. [b] white lobed medallion outlined with blue containing a left-facing standing male figure with red sleeves and trousers and a white robe.  To the right of him is a dark green and red cypress tree with a red bird on top. This appears frequently as a patch across the whole cover. Colours: silk, red, dark blue, dark green, white.",
