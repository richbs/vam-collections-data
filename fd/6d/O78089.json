This jug is not made from the more usual stoneware, but from unglazed, vitrified bone china, commonly known as Parian porcelain. Parian was developed commercially by several factories from the mid-1840s, mainly for statuary.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe jug bears copies of  the reliefs sculpted on the base of Nelson's Column, in Trafalgar Square, which was only about 10 years old in 1852.  Admiral Horatio, Viscount Nelson (1758-1805) defeated the French at the Battle of Trafalgar where he died in 1805. The Neptune figure on the handle and other marine motifs emphasise Nelson's maritime prowess.\n\nPeople\nAlfred Henry Forrester (1804-1872) (under the pseudonym of Alfred Crowquill) with his brother Charles Robert (under the pseudonym of Hal Willis) contributed pen-and-ink sketches to periodicals, and exhibited works at the Royal Academy. He wrote and illustrated over 20 humorous works including the Tour of Dr Syntax (1838) and also illustrated his brother's works. He designed 19 objects for Alcock's stand at the Great Exhibition, including a Plate of All Nations, fairy and nautilus cups, a snail ring holder, a butterfly pen holder, and a lily cup and saucer.\n\nHistorical Associations\nSamuel Alcock & Co. (Cobridge, 1828-1853 and Burslem, 1830-1859) gained a prize medal for china at the Great Exhibition.  The stand showed objects designed by Forrester, S.W. Arnold, and Giovanni Meli. The firm was known for the range and quality of its moulded jugs, produced from 1842, and was praised at the Exhibition for its cheaper wares, as well as for its attractive and novel fancy porcelain articles.",
