The pit area is occupied by an exterior location with flower beds and wheelbarrow. The surrounds suggests barns or out-buildings.\n\nThe production featured Denise Coffey as Kate, Nicky Henson as Marlow, Richard Pearson as Mr. Hardcastle and Gavin Reed as Tony Lumpkin. John Barber in the Daily Telegraph noted that \u2018The audience are placed round three sides of Mr. Hardcastle\u2019s house, so unfortunately mistaken by Young Marlow for a wayside inn. Exposed as in a goldfish bowl, the actors must be totally honest. The least exaggeration of posture or voice will betray them as fakes to youngsters seated barely a yard away.\u2019 Generally reviews were favourable although Nicholas de Jongh in the Guardian (05/02/1972) considered the setting over complicated \u2018ugly and unfunctional\u2026with its cluster of exits, [which] imposes semi naturalism uneasily on the open stage.\u2019 The Young Vic\u2019s production that also played at Edinburgh and Aberdeen was produced by Wendy Toye with lighting by Derek J. Brown. The production opened at the Young Vic on 25/01/1972",
