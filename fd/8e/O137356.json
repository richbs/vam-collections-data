Sk\u00e5ne province, in the extreme south of Sweden, has the richest tradition, and more jewellery was worn there than in any other district.   Almost all the Swedish traditional jewellery at the V&A comes from Sk\u00e5ne.  \n\nSwedish rings were usually made of thin sheet silver, often decorated with coloured glass or pendants.  They were often given at marriage, but were part of the dowry wealth, not true wedding rings.  The bride and groom did not exchange rings in Sweden until the late 19th century.  \n\nThis ring comes from Sk\u00e5ne.  It has a decorative border and repouss\u00e9 patterns on the front, and a single pendant disc, which are all typical of Sk\u00e5ne.  It has the maker's mark NR.  There are two traditional silversmiths from Sk\u00e5ne who could have made it: Niklas Ramberg of Lund, active 1803-47; and Nils Ramberg of Simrishamn, active 1822-59.",
