He first trained with Christian Gottlieb Steinlen (1779-1847) in Vevey and subsequently with Fran\u00e7ois Bonnet (1811-1894) in Lausanne. In Paris in 1845, Bocion entered the atelier of Louis-Aim\u00e9 Grosclaude (1784-1869) and later that of Charles Gleyre (1806-1874) and befriended Gustave Courbet (1819-1877) and other important exponents of the Realist movement. Back in Lausanne in 1849 he became a teacher at the Ecole moyenne et industrielle of Lausane, a position he held until his death. At the same time, he had an extensive output with several travels abroad. He exhibited in Paris, Vienna, Anvers, London and was a founder member of the Swiss society of watercolorists (1884). \n\nThis painting depicts an unidentified Italian or Swiss lake near the Alps, which appear in the background. This view is probably that of an altitude lake. The two figures conversing add a pleasant anecdote to the composition. The compositional formula is slightly reminiscent of the classical landscapes by Claude and Poussin whereas the paint handling, palette and subject matter are close in style to Bocion although inferior in quality. Bocion was best known for his numerous views of the Leman lake and this painting was probably executed by a close follower around mid 19th century.",

In frame'; bequeathed by Rev. Chauncey Hare Townshend, 1868.\n\nHistorical significance: This painting belongs to a large group of 19th-century landscape paintings bequeathed by the Rev. Townshend to the museum in 1868. \nThe subject matter of the present painting recalls such works by Bocion as 'The Shore of the Leman Lake with Figures', dated c. 1855, Victoria & Albert Museum, London but probably does not depict the Leman lake. It is most likely to be a view of some mountains' lake, generally situated at the pass between two summits and therefore at high altitude.\nAlthough the handling of paint and the palette dominated by blue hues are close in style to F. Bocion but look inferior in quality. This painting was therefore possibly executed by a follower of Bocion around mid 19th century.",
