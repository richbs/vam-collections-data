            "public_access_description": "Malcolm Scott, dubbed 'The Woman Who Knows' was a music hall performer who specialised in female impersonations. Like all the pantomime dames of the late19th and early 20th century, his stage character was always resolutely a man in skirts rather than a man trying to be overtly glamorous or outrageous. Two of his best known characters were extravagantly dressed however including Elizabeth I and her step-mother, Katharine Parr, Henry VIII's last wife. Other characters included a grotesque 'Mrs John Bull' the typical Englishwoman.\n\nBorn in 1872, Malcolm was the son of a distinguished Harley Street doctor. He was orphaned aged fourteen and sailed to Canada with the romantic intention of fighting Red Indians but made his living selling peanuts. He returned to England to be an actor, and his career took off when he was employed to understudy Dan Leno as Widow Twankey in Aladdin at the London Pavilion.",
