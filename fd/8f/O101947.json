You can clearly see the cleaning product bottles and plastic containers that have been partially melted down and put to another use after their expected lifetime.   Product packaging, such as the bottles used in this chair, make up 35% of the plastic consumption in this country.  Plastics are usually non-biodegradable and therefore pose environmental problems.  Although there has been an increase in the number of recycling schemes across the country, land-fill sites are still the most popular form of waste management for most local councils, although sites for such dumping are rapidly being exhausted.  It is thought that only 7% of plastics are currently recycled.\n\nThis chair was commissioned by the Furniture & Woodwork department here at the V&A and made up from plastic items donated by staff.",
