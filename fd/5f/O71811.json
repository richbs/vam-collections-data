The satin ground has supplementary wefts (in gold, green, red, blue, white) bound in twill and shows a superior quality of weaving. The main body features two pairs of five-clawed gold dragons, one above the other. Each dragon of the upper pair is grasping a flaming jewel, and is pursued by the dragon below. This scene takes place among multi-coloured clouds, and above rocks amid waves and <i>lishui</i> (striped border). The lower pair of dragons have emerged from these waves and rocks. In the waves are a few lucky symbols.\n\nOn the back, in the top centre is a fronted five-clawed dragon coiled around a flaming jewel. Below are a pair of dragons facing one another. Along the lower edge is a border of waves, rocks and lucky symbols similar to that on the front. All the dragons on the back and front of the vest have long snouts.\n\nThe borders at the front, sides and lower edge are edged with a narrow black silk cut velvet trim, to which brass studs have been applied. This has been edged with red and green strips \u2013 one on either side \u2013 and patterned with gold.\n\nThe garment is front fastening with gilt buttons and frogs, has no collar and is sleeveless. There are slits at the sides to a depth of 26.5 inches (67.3 cm). There is a brown, cream, red, green and blue tasselled fringe 11 inches (27.9 cm) deep at the hem which makes the vest full-length.\n\nThe garment has a pink silk satin lining. On the inside of a gilded strip of skin lining the top of the fringe are a series of Chinese characters painted in black.",
