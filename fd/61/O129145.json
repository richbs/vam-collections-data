These paintings were not meant to be used as designs for prints, as these were generally based on much freer sketches. Instead, they were individual works, purchased by a wealthier clientele.\n\nThis is the second of three paintings held by the V&A depicting scenes from a popular story called 'An Unfortunate Tale'. Ky\u00f4sai, one of Japan\u2019s most prolific artists, follows the sad plight of a woman. \n\nThe first work in this series shows a woman being kicked out by a man with a pipe (museum no. D.1385-1897). In this, the second in the series, the woman is shown weeping on a mound, watched by a perplexed couple. In the next image in the series, she is tormented by a gang of children (museum no. D.1387-1897).",
