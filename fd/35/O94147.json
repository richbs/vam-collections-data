            "physical_description": "A breakfront commode raise on high, cabriole legs, veneered in mahogany, walnut and other woods (some stained), with gilt-bronze mounts and marble slab.  The shape is that of a French Transitional commode, the body rectangular, with a breakfront section in the centre and with canted front corners. The main panel on the front shows a marquetry design of two putti supporting a corn sheaf (the arms of the Vasa family, the royal family of Sweden).\n\nSoftwood backboard, laterally grained, made from two wide planks and a narrow section at the bottom (top plank 8-3/4 in. high, middle plank 9\u00bc in. high, bottom plank 2--3 in. high, top edge sloping, higher at right end). Backboard is housed in a grooove in the pine back stiles, and fixed by plugged screws (or possibly dowels) to the back edge of the bottom board. The screws (or dowels) are not evenly spaced; there is a cluster of four at the right end, then several spaced 7--8 inches apart, and then a pair at the left end. An inch from the top, the backboard has a full-width groove, \u00bd inch high and \u00bd inch deep, which seems to have no relevance to the construction of the commode -- possibly from a previous use of the board.\n\nThe softwood back stiles each have a dovetail mortise at the level of the frieze-drawer dustboard -- though the dustboard itself does not extend all the way back to the stiles; from inside a gap can be felt between the back of the dustboard and the backboard.\n\nIn the back face of the back right stile (but not the back left stile) are four dowels -- at the top, and then at intervals of 4, 3\u00bd and 3 inches below -- possibly to repair a crack in the stile.\n\nThe pine case sides are dovetailed to the pine top and bottom boards. The bottom board was apparently intended at first to sit about 1\u00bd inches lower in relation to the legs, for all four legs are rebated at this lower level, and have then been patched to fill 1\u00bd inches of the rebate.\n\nFrieze drawer is made of birch. Drawer-bottom fixed to back with dowels or plugged screws -- grain suggests plugged screws, but the plugs are very small in diameter.",

The overall shape, the intricate marquetry and the gilt-bronze mounts all look as if they came from Parisian workshops, although the commode is unusually wide. In fact, it was made in Stockholm in 1779 by Georg Haupt, who became cabinetmaker to the King of Sweden in 1769. In his early career, after his apprenticeship in Stockholm, Haupt travelled widely to improve his training. After a short visit to Germany, he worked in turn in Amsterdam, Paris and London before he was granted his royal appointment. It is not surprising that he went to Paris to learn new skills: not only was the French capital recognized as the leading city for the luxury trades at the time, but there had also been strong links between the courts of Stockholm and Paris since the late 17th century. \nThe massive swags with which this commode is mounted and inlaid, and it's generally bold and imposing effect, are typical of the early phase of Parisian neoclassicism to which Haupt remained faithful in Sweden long after a lighter and more refined version of neoclassical ornament had become fashionable elsewhere.\nThis commode must have been made for a royal commission because the central motif of the marquetry, a wheatsheaf supported by two putti, forms part of the coat of arms of the Swedish royal family.",
