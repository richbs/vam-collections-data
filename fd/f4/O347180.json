From 22 June 1900 onwards, these casts were on loan to the South Kensington Museum from Sydney Vacher, Esq. (1854-1934). They came to the Museum along with several parcels, including 135 casts that Vacher hoped the museum would buy. With these parcels, he attached a letter, in which he referred to the set of mother-of-pearl casts: 'I also include 8 casts of medieval mother of pearl carvings made for me by Ready of the British Museum. On loan as they are the only record of the specimens I gave the museum.' Vacher subsequently donated them to the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1905.",

From 22 June 1900 onwards, these casts were on loan to the South Kensington Museum from Sydney Vacher, Esq. (1854-1934). They came to the Museum along with several parcels including 135 casts that Vacher hoped the museum would buy. With these parcels, he attached a letter, in which he referred to the set of mother-of-pearl casts: 'I also include 8 casts of medieval mother of pearl carvings made for me by Ready of the British Museum. On loan as they are the only record of the specimens I gave the museum.' Vacher subsequently donated them to the South Kensington Museum in 1905.",
