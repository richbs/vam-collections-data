Morris was the artist and designer who was the greatest single influence on the Arts and Crafts movement and the most successful textile designer and manufacturer of his day.  Morris revived the craft of block printing and vegetable dyeing and in his own home he set up looms for tapestry weaving and the hand knotting of carpets. He was highly influenced by historical patterns and was one of the most knowledgeable textile historians of the late 19th century. Morris & Co. was founded by William Morris in 1875, producing textiles commercially for sale in two London shops.\n  \nManufacturing indigo discharge fabrics by hand like this one is a labour intensive process.  First the textile is dyed by immersion in indigo, then areas of it are bleached white again.  The other vegetable dyes are block printed one by one over the bleached areas until the pattern is complete.",
