This example forms part of a large collection of carving that belonged to Sir Charles Allom, founder of the Edwardian firm of interior decorators, White Allom & Co. The firm, founded in 1902, specialized in historic decorative schemes, chiefly in 17th- and 18th-century styles. They provided their clients both with old furniture and with reproductions made by the firm. Sir Charles probably formed the collection in part to provide models for his craftsmen, and the gift to the Museum was doubtless intended to inspire craftsmen more widely.",
