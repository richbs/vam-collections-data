She might compose the design herself, or buy it, like this one. The effect of the paint colours on the pile of the velvet gave the pattern a density and texture quite different from the crispness and delicacy of painted taffeta and satin, popular from the later 18th century.\n\nPeople\nThis watercolour design came to the V&A in a collection of designs and examples of painted velvet, with a trade card inscribed 'Mr. Henry, Artist. Miniature Profile. Velvet. Ornament Painter'. The design is signed 'H.H. Henry', but nothing further is known about him. His designs can be compared to those illustrated by Nathaniel Whittock in The Art of Drawing and Colouring from Nature; Flowers, Fruit, and Shells: To Which is Added, Correct Directions for Preparing the Most Brilliant Colours for Painting on Velvet, with the Mode of UsingThem: Also the New Method of Oriental Tinting, published in London in 1829.",
