Like processional groups, such images would be venerated during Holy Week. This is a diminutive version of the life-size pieces, by Fern\u00e1ndez, who popularised the type in Castile.\n\nFern\u00e1ndez was the leading Castilian sculptor of the first half of the 17th century. First recorded in Valladolid in 1605, he was to spend his whole working life there. Initially he collaborated with, and probably trained under the Valladolid sculptor Francisco de Rinc\u00f3n. He was also influenced by the work of his 16th century predecessor in the city Juan de Juni (c. 1507-1577), and by the effigies of the Duke and Duchess of Lerma by Pompeo Leoni, who was in Valladolid in 1601. Fern\u00e1ndez specialised in carving wood figures and reliefs for altarpieces, as well as processional groups. He established a number of influential iconographic types which came to be much imitated during the 17th century. Most of his works were made for churches in Castile, and particularly Valladolid.",
