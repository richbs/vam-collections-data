Italian goldsmiths were expert at making a little material go a very long way.  They used thin sheet gold to make impressive pieces of jewellery, and decorated them with glass stones made to look like real gems.  \n\nThese earrings are made of silver-plated metal set with facetted stones, with cheap baroque pearl drops.  They were intended to imitate the expensive diamond and pearl jewellery of the 17th century.  The shape, with three drops hanging from a central boss, is called a girandole.  It was immensely popular throughout Europe, and survived until the end of the 19th century with traditional costume in Italy.\n\nThese earrings were bought as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
