The core texts of a Gospel Book were the four accounts of Christ\u2019s life attributed to Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.  Since early Christian times each Gospel was traditionally preceded by a portrait of the Evangelist who wrote it.  This grew out of Classical Roman texts, which were often prefaced by a portrait of the author.\n\nIn this particular portrait, a Greek inscription above the figure\u2019s head identifies him as St Mark.  Unlike many Western examples of the same subject, the Evangelist is not accompanied by his traditional symbol \u2013 a lion.  He is in the process of writing his Gospel, a scroll draped over his knee and a desk in front of him displaying equipment used for writing.  The variety of implements shown is specific to Byzantine author portraits.\n\nIn the nineteenth century many medieval illuminated manuscripts were cut up and their constituent leaves dispersed. Individual leaves usually fetched a higher price than bound volumes and highly decorated ones were most vulnerable to separation.  This particluar leaf may have belonged to a Gospel Book now in the State Historical Museum in Moscow (MS. Sin. Gr. 41). The leaf was purchased by the V&A in 1883 from W.H.J. Weale for \u00a33.",

            "history_note": "This manuscript leaf was one of a group of seemingly unrelated leaves purchased from W. H. J. Weale on April 9th 1883.  As a whole, the group cost \u00a326.17.6.  Individually, this leaf cost \u00a33.\n\nThe entry in the Register of Drawings 1880 to 1884 (museum numbers 8526 to 11002) lists the leaf as:\n\n<i>Miniature: St. Mark, seated, with a long roll, near a lectern on the stand of which are materials for writing and painting.  On gold ground.  Greek, c.1080</i>\n\nHistorical significance: Since Early Christian times Gospel Books have traditionally included portraits of the relevant Evangelist at the beginning of each Gospel.  This phenomenon grew out of Classical Roman texts, which had often been prefaced by a portrait of the author.  Such author portraits can be found in both Eastern and Western manuscripts but there are certain characteristics which seem to be more commonly associated with one tradition than the other.  \n\nWhile examples do exist, on the whole, Byzantine Evangelist portraits do not include the symbols often associated with Matthew, Mark, Luke and John (a winged man, lion, bull and eagle respectively).  In keeping with Byzantine representation they also depict the Evangelists as young men and often employ a predominantly plain, gilded background.  \n\nThe types of writing equipment included in the image also differ.  Most Western Evangelist portraits show only a quill and perhaps an ink pot/horn and sometimes a knife for scraping the vellum to erase mistakes.  Byzantine images, as shown in this example, often include a much wider range of implements, the function of which is not always clear.  These include various combinations of what look like a plaited cord, small circular sponges, a pair of compasses, a small box ?ink palette, a crook-shape bladed instrument, a trapezoid blade, a small rolled up scroll, and a long-necked cylindrical flask, often housed on a shelf in a recess within the desk itself and only visible because the door normally concealing it is wide open.\n\nThis leaf displays many of the characteristic Byzantine elements that were so admired by the West.  These include the dark shading and careful modelling of the face and the voluminous draperies, which show Byzantine art as a repository of what remained of classical naturalism in the Middle Ages.  Features such as these had great influence on Western artists in the twelfth century. \n\nFurther reading: \n\n<i>The Illustrations of the Prefaces in Byzantine Gospels</i> by George Galavaris, Vienna, 1979 (NAL 93.PP.32) \n<i>The Iconography of Preface and Miniature in the Byzantine Gospel Book</i> by Robert S.

            "historical_context_note": "Gospel Books contained the full text of the Gospels \u2013 the four accounts of the life of Christ attributed to Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.  These texts were often accompanied by introductory material such as the Prefaces of Saint Jerome, Eusebius\u2019s canon tables (a concordance system devised in the 4th century by Eusebius of Caesarea, in which Gospel passages are numbered \u2013 the Byzantines used letters - in the text and correspond to tables, arranged in columnar form, indicating the concordance of passages amongst the Gospels) and chapter lists.   \n\nGospel Books survive in far larger numbers than any other type of book produced by the Byzantines.  A typical Byzantine Gospel Book contained three main decorative elements: canon tables, evangelist portraits and a headpiece preceding the Gospel text.  The canon tables were often richly decorated using architectural motifs such as columns and capitals. These supported canopies which themselves formed a groundline for decorative additions such as a cross or a fountain or images of humans, birds or beasts.  \n\nThe opening of each of the Gospels usually occupied two facing pages of the book, with an image of the evangelist on the left and the start of the text beneath a decorative headpiece on the right.  The evangelist is usually shown seated, at work on the start of his Gospel.  The headpiece was usually a panel of pure ornament with the title of the book set out in decorative gold capitals above, below, or in a framed panel within it.  The Gospel text followed, opening with an enlarged initial, sometimes formed of figures or even a miniature image of the evangelist.\n\nMany medieval illuminated manuscripts were cut up in the nineteenth century and their constituent leaves dispersed - individual leaves usually fetched a higher price than bound volumes.  This leaf would almost certainly once have been part of a complete Byzantine Gospel Book.  In <i>The Medieval Treasury - The Art of the Middle Ages in the Victoria and Albert Museum</i>, edited by Paul Williamson, London, 1986, Michael Kauffmann draws attention to a Russian scholar who suggested the leaf was once part of a Gospel Book in the State Historical Museum in Moscow (MS Sin. Gr.41), which contains very similar miniatures.\n\nSee <i>Early Christian and Byzantine Art</i> by John Lowden, London, 1997 and <i>Understanding Illuminated Manuscripts - A Guide to Technical Terms</i> by Michelle P.Brown, London, 1994.",
