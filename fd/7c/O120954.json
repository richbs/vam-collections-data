The case in 1948 would have been fitted for the jewel, but it is clear that the brooch pin is a later alteration.  If the jewel had been altered prior to 1948, the case would have been fitted to accommodate it.  The printed inscription on the silk inside the case is badly rubbed but may once have included Cartier's New York and London addresses, as well as Paris, which would mean that it cannot be earlier than 1909, even if we discount the evidence of the stamp on the case.",
