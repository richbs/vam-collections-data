The procession, featuring floats reresenting aspects of the year including Easter and Thanksgiving, paraded around the 3-ring circus in New York's Madison Square Garden building, where Barnum's circus had performed since 1881, and while tenting throught the USA.\n\nAfter they acquired Barnum's Circus in 1907, the Ringlings ran the Ringling and the Barnum and Bailey shows as two separate units - Barnum & Bailey Greatest Show on Earth, and Ringling Brothers World's Greatest Show and Spectacle -  but combined them in 1919.  Despite losing control of the syndicate in 1932 during the Depression, and the death of  the last Ringling brother John in 1936, his nephews John Ringling North and Henry Ringling North regained control of the circus in 1938 and kept it tenting until 1956, and playing indoor arenas only into the 1960s..\n\nJohn Ringling North first employed the Broadway set designer Norman Bel Geddes and the Broadway musical revue director John Murray Anderson for the 1941 season.  By 1942 they were joined by George Balanchine, and the modernist composer Igor Stravinsky who produced the elephant ballet Circus Polka, a popular act in the 1942 show.",
