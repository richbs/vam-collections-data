It is made by Giovanni Antonio Cybei (b.1706; d. 1784), in Florence in 1773.\nAccording to verbal information from a previous owner, the bust, along with A2-1950, was previously at Dewhurst, Wadhurst Sussex, and was brought from Italy ca. 1866 by a collector named Gee. A photograph of the bust shows that at Dewhurst it stood on a console, with, beneath a tablet with an inscription. The inscription establishes that the bust was commissioned by Giulio Gori, Chamberlain to the Grand-Duke at Tuscany, to commemorate Leopold's presence at the wedding of his daughter to Francesco Zondadari on 14 August, 1773. It is likely to have been carved soon after that time. It forms part of a group of commemorative busts of the Grand-Duke.",

A.\nAccording to verbal information from a previous owner, the bust, along with A2-1950, was previously at Dewhurst, Wadhurst Sussex, and was brought from Italy ca. 1866 by a collector named Gee. A photograph of the bust shows that at Dewhurst it stood on a console, with, beneath a tablet with an inscription. The inscription establishes that the bust was commissioned by Giulio Gori, Chamberlain to the Grand-Duke at Tuscany, to commemorate Leopold's presence at the wedding of his daughter to Francesco Zondadari on 14 August, 1773. It is likely to have been carved soon after that time. It forms part of a group of commemorative busts of the Grand-Duke.",
