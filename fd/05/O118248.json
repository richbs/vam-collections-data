The 19th century saw a craze for ceramic figurines of performers and Agatha Walker attempted to revive this tradition with her limited edition sculptures. They were modelled from life in plaster and coated with a fine wax layer which was then coloured.  In 1931 there was an exhibition of her wax figures at the Fine Art Society.\n\nThis represents the actress Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies (1891-1992) as Mrs Sidney Herbert, or Lady Herbert of Lea in The Lady With a Lamp, a new play about the life of Florence Nightingale by Ronald Berkeley.  This opened at London's Arts Theatre on 6th January 1929 and after ten performances transferred to the Garrick Theatre on the 24th January where it stayed until the middle of June, achieving a run of 164 perfomances. Edith Evans played Florence Nightingale, and critics noted the superb way these two star actresses were a perfect foil for each other on stage.",
