It bears both the Britannia hallmark (a seated figure of Britannia with a shield and trident) and the Lion's Head Erased hallmark. The alloy has a greater silver content (958.4 parts of silver to 41.6 parts copper) than sterling silver (925 parts of silver to 75 parts of copper). It is also  much softer than sterling silver so wears badly, but its very softness makes it more suitable for casting.\n\nTime\nMuch English silverware was melted down during the Civil War of 1642-1646 to provide coinage. After the Restoration of 1660 there was a high demand for the reconversion of coinage for the making of silverware, which resulted in a great shortage of coin. The higher standard of Britannia silver was imposed by the Crown to prevent the widespread practice of 'clipping' coin to obtain the very scarce sterling silver. The law was repealed when enormous quantities of silver became available from the Americas. After 1720 silversmith could elect to use either standard.",
