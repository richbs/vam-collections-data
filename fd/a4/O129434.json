A tubular metal frame forms the curvilinear shape of the chair which is then covered with foam upholstery wrapped in a green jersey fabric. This covering was also available in exotic zebra stripes or panther spots.  The chair demonstrates his interest in the clean lines and organic forms Scandinavian design, but also displays a more playful use of form, materials and colour influenced by American designers such as Charles Eames, whom Paulin greatly admired. \n\nChair 582 was shown as a prototype at the Utrecht Furniture Exhibition in 1965, and production began in 1966. Also known as the Ribbon Chair, it was included in the exhibition of chairs at the Musee des Arts Decoratifs, Paris in 1968 and received an American Interior Design Award in 1969. In 1970 this chair was included in the  Modern Chairs exhibition at the Whitechapel Art Gallery.",
