These prints come from a set published in 1722 by Pieter van der Aa as illustrations to the <u>Thesaurus anituitatum et historiarum Italiae</u> by Johan Georg Graevius.\n\nHistorical significance: This print is one of a set of 103 published by Pieter van der Aa (1659-1733)  in 1722 after plates from Carlevarijs' volume <u> Le fabriche e vedute di Venezia disegnate poste in prospettiva et intagliate da Luca Carlevaris</u>. Published in 1703, this book consists of 104 views of Venice designed and engraved by Luca Carlevarijs. This was the first published volume of printed views of Venice. It was highly influential with many later view painters, including Canaletto, borrowing composition ideas from it for their own paintings. The work's influence can also be seen in the number of prints made after it following its publication at the beginning of the century. Van der Aa produced this set of prints in his native Leiden as illustrations to the <u>Thesaurus antiquitatum et historiarum Italiae</u>, written by the German classical scholar Johan Georg Graevius (1632-1703). Finished by Pieter Burmann  the Elder (1704-1725) and published after the death of Graevius, the <u>Thesaurus antiquitatum et historiarum Italiae</u> is one of the author's most important works.\n\nOn the left of the print is the church of the Carmine. On the right, opposite the church is the <i>Palazzo Foscarini</i>. Taking its name from the church that it leads to, the Carmine Bridge was one of the areas in Venice where fighting contests would be held. As the Latin inscription suggests, this print represents the war between the Castellani and Nicolotti, two factions of the Dosoduro <i>quartiere</i> or area of Venice. The bridge is swarming with the men fighting and in the foreground people can be seen watching the event from the campo in front of the church and along the side of the canal. The inscription goes on to state that this particular fight was held as part of the entertainment for King Henry III of France (1551-1589) who visited Venice in 1574. This print is an example of Carlevarijs drawing from events in Venetian history to illustrate the views of <u> Le fabriche e vedute di Venezia </u>.",
