Two players take opposite home bases.\n\nIf there are three or more players, each player takes ten pieces of one colour and places in the appropriate coloured corner. with each facing an empty corner.  Four or more players play in opposite corners.\n\nThe aim of the game is for one player to be the first to transfer all his pieces to the opposite cormer; order of play is usually clockwise.\nEach player takes a turn, in which he may move a piece into an adjoining empty hole, or jump over a single peg of any colour, to an empty hole beyond.  If he is able to jump one or more further pegs, he may do so.  Pieces may jump along the lines in any direction.  Only one piece may be moved in one turn, but it may be taken as far as the jumping possibilities allow.\nA popular strategy is to place some pieces so that they form a ladder along which the others can jump towards the goal; such a ladder may be equally useful, however, to an opponent who is moving his pieces in the opposite direction.\n\nRules placement: pasted inside the lid, in Englis and French",
