She renovated this model for the Theatre Museum in 2000, using parts of  the original and some new material.\nA Midsummer Night's Dream, directed by Peter Brook, opened at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford, on 27 August 1970. It was then taken to New York and on to Chicago, Boston, Toronto and Philadelphia, and joined the RSC's London season at the Aldwych Theatre on 10 June 1971. It began a world tour in September 1972, first visiting Europe,  then returning for a Christmas season at the Aldwych before playing for a week at Stratford and then embarking on a year-long tour to America, Japan and Australia.\n\nHistorical significance: One of the most celebrated and discussed of twentieth-century Shakespeare productions, Peter Brook's A Midsummer Night's Dream used a bare white box set in which the play's magic was created through circus tricks: the fairies wore simple, brightly coloured, costumes suggested by those of Chinese acrobats and swung in on trapezes; Puck confounded the lovers while balanced on stilts amd juggled a spinning plate to represent the magic flower. Brook swept away the theatrical traditions and much of the 'prettiness' that had become associated with the play and, in redefining A Midsummer Night's Dream for the 1970s, exerted an enormous influence on subsequent productions.",
