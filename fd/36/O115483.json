The coats of arms in the borders (one is embroidered and has been added over a blank shield) are those of three patrician families of Augsburg: Gossenbrot, Rehlinger and Welser. The borders of large scrolling leafwork with birds are clearly of German character and only found in tapestries commissioned by German patrons.",

The juxtaposition of the shields suggests the exemplification, at the top of the tapestry, of the marriage of Sigmund Gossenbrot with Anne Rehlinger (1476) and of those beneath of Lucas Welser with Ursula Gossenbrot (after 1500).\nNo doubt of the German character of the unusual border. They are remarkable because of their great width and the character of the large leaf-scroll with birds, also the size and prominence of the coat of arms.",
