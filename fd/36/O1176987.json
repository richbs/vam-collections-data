Worn by Martin Meister, who said at the time:\n\n'The idea was to dress in velvet and silk - to be a dark glamorous puss; a Lord of the Night,' says Martin Meister, an Austrian living in London, who has provided the V & A with a goth outfit. 'But it's not a glam goth outfit,' he insists, referring to the plain black wool jacket, leggings, dark green shirt and pointy shoes. 'When I was 15 and 16 I became a goth in Austria. I coloured my hair black and bought all the Souxie records.'\n\nWhat was being a goth about? 'A real goth had a gloomy aura but was influenced by quite sophisticated things like Edgar Allen Poe,' he says. 'Real goths were into poetry, spiritual things . . . unlike the goths today who I think are just poseurs.' Would Meister admit to being a goth now? 'Yes, because of my thinking. I still like gloomy things: my favourite film ever is Nosferatu, but as a child I liked the Adams Family and the Munsters - I thought: 'Oh God, what a lifestyle.'\n\n(Martin Meister, interviewed by Sarah Callard for \"The British supermarket of style\", published in The Independent, Saturday 25 September 1994)",
