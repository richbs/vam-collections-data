It was at this stage that the bowl was damaged and then discarded.\n\nImages of women's heads in profile are common in Italian Renaissance ceramics. A fragmentary bowel in the Fondazione Fioini in Legnago has a very similar image and probably were made in the same workshop. Both bowls were given by Maria Fiorini who excavated sites in Legnago.The large number of kiln wasters discovered at Legnago suggests the presence of several ceramic workshops in the area in the 15th and 16th centuries. \n\nThe dotted background on this fragment was executed with a rouletted wheel. The main image was incised first and then the background was dotted. The decorator of this object accidentally scored over the woman's chin with his wheel.",
