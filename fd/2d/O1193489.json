The doll belonged to her older sister, Lorraine, and was given to her as a Christmas present from her parents. It was made by Pedigree in the 1960s, an English manufacturing company best known for launching Sindy in 1963. They are a subsidiary of Lines Bros., who first became involved in the production of toys in about 1850.\n\nThis doll is made from vinyl, which was introduced as a material in doll manufacturing in the 1950s. A much more flexible material, it brought around a change in dolls' hair, allowing it to be rooted, as seen in this doll, rather than the wigs or painted on hair that composition or hard plastic dolls used.",
