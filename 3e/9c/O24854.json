Her legs, which cross over below the knees, are swung to the left while she inclines her head to the right. She is wearing a long robe with tight long sleeves carved in horizontal folds down their entire length. The neck is decorated with a flat heavy necklace (<i>kantha</i>) of rectangular gems or beads.  Her hair falls in waves on either side of her head to her shoulders where it ends in fat ringlets. She appears to have a long scarf or <i>uttariya</i> worn over her head with the long ends falling to the floor on either side. She is holding the neck of her musical instrument in her left hand while she plucks its two strings with a plectrum in her right hand.\n      She is shown seated on a solid stool with a deeply incised chevron pattern with chamfered edges to the lozenges. On the lower right hand side is the damaged form of a bird (now headless) with a splayed tail and wings with lines of drilled dots. The left foot is missing but three claws of the right foot survive.  The carving is also damaged at each corner at the top, but appears to have a possible floral design with criss-crossed incised lines echoing the design on the stool.",
