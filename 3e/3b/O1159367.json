They had the features of a jointed teddy bear body, but had a doll face and a little hood made from the same material from the body surrounding the head. \n\nThe teddy dolls or eskimo dolls were a distinctive novelty of 1908, though they were first made in 1906 to encourage girls who usually played with dolls to play with teddy bears. This particular doll is probably later because it has a celluloid head, whereas others were made of composition or bisque. Celluloid was invented in 1869, but took decades of experimenting before being used successfully in the manufacture of dolls and toys. Germany had the earliest production of celluloid dolls, followed by the United States and Japan. At first, many parents were reluctant to buy celluloid dolls for their children because it had a reputation for being flammable and was no less expensive than porcelain or bisque dolls. However, eventually its lightweight durability and realistic appearance won and the celluloid dolls became popular. The teddy doll was meant to last a dozen dolls because of its soft body and jointed parts.",

Daniel started to attend auctions and shows with her at the weekends and as a child of 9 or 10, what caught his eye most were the toys.",
