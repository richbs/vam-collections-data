            "public_access_description": "Hussein Chalayan is one of Britain\u2019s leading designers. His work explores the boundaries between fashion, performance, art and design.  He is renowned for his extraordinary use of materials and experimental technology. \n\nChalayan was born in Nicosia in 1970 and moved to Britain in 1978 where he studied fashion at Warwickshire School of Arts, and went on to study Fashion Design at Central Saint Martins. His graduation collection \u2018The Tangent Flow\u2019 in 1993 was an instant hit and was immediately shown in Browns in London. His work explores complex themes such as migration and cultural identity as well as his fascination in popular culture. He has received two British Fashion Awards in 1999 and 2000 and was awarded an MBE in 2006. \n\nThis laser cut tulle dress, remade by the designer for the V&A\u2019s exhibition \u2018British Design 1948-2012\u2019, was originally created for Chalayan\u2019s groundbreaking Spring/Summer collection in 2000. The dress, made using the then relatively new concept of laser-cutting, is typical of Chalayan\u2019s use of innovative materials and use of form and structure to pose questions about feminine identity.",
