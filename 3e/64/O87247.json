It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years.  Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nSommerlad's drawing, featuring Leslie Henson's characteristically bulbous eyes, probably depicts him as a fish because of the amount that is drunk by his character, Robert Popejoy, in Bob's Your Uncle.  The musical, written by Austin Melford with music by Noel Gay, concerned the trials of a couple at their honeymoon hotel, and ran at London's Saville Theatre from May 1948 before going on tour.  Leslie Henson was a great favourite by 1948, having started his career with a Concert Party troupe in 1910.  His drunken antics in this musical were very well-received, as was his casting opposite Vera Pearce, who towered over Henson in her role as Mrs Edgoose.",
