            "public_access_description": "This poster was designed by Michael English, half of the design duo Hapshash and the Coloured Coat. In the late 1960s, they created psychedelic posters for many of the English bands of the time, and decorated and advertised Nigel Waymouth's King's Road boutique, Granny Takes a Trip. They also designed for concerts held at the UFO club and Saville Theatre, and for underground magazine Oz. Their influences came from the decorative and eroticised designs of Art Nouveau, combined with the melting rainbow colours of LSD visions and pop art inspirations from the post-war media; traces of Disney, horror movie monsters and comic book characters and can often be seen  hiding amongst the images.\n\nJulie Felix arrived in the United Kingdom from California in 1956, after graduating from high school. She became the first solo folk performer signed to a major British record label, when she got a recording contract with Decca Records. By 1965, she was a headlining performer, and by the end of that year, she had filled the Royal Albert Hall for one of her concerts.",
