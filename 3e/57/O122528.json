            "public_access_description": "This fragment comes from a Gradual made for San Michele a Murano, a Camaldolese monastery in Venice. Don Silvestro dei Gherarducci, who may have painted this initial, was a monk of the Camaldolese Order. He was based in the monastery of Santa Maria degli Angeli in Florence. The monastery was the home of a number of scribes, painters and illuminators in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. They worked both for their own house and for other churches and even secular customers. Silvestro dei Gherarducci (1339-1399) was active as a painter and illuminator in the abbey from the 1370s. Silvestro may have worked as part of a team, with some of the ornament done by others. Whether or not he painted all the miniatures in the San Michele a Murano Graduals has been questioned. Silvestro's assistant, the Master of the Canzoni, may have illuminated this initial V.\n\nIt is not known when these choirbooks were cut up. This initial was transferred from the Art Museum to the V&A in December 1863. Their acquisition by the Museum before 1863 is the earliest known indication that they had entered the trade. Others from the same manuscript were purchased by the Museum in 1906.",

            "history_note": "The fragment comes from a Gradual made for San Michele a Murano, a Camaldolese monastery in Venice. Don Silvestro dei Gherarducci, who may have painted this initial, was a monk of the Camaldolese Order. He was based in the monastery of Santa Maria degli Angeli in Florence. The monastery was the home of a number of scribes, painters and illuminators in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. They worked both for their own house and for other churches and even secular customers. Silvestro dei Gherarducci (1339-1399) was active as a painter and illuminator in the abbey from the 1370s. Silvestro may have worked as part of a team, with some of the ornament done by others. Whether or not he painted all the miniatures in the San Michele a Murano Graduals has been questioned. Silvestro's assistant, the Master of the Canzoni, may have illuminated this initial V.\n\nIt is not known when these choirbooks were cut up. This initial was transferred from the Art Museum to the V&A in December 1863. Their acquisition by the Museum before 1863 is the earliest known indication that they had entered the trade. Others from the same manuscript were purchased by the Museum in 1906.",
