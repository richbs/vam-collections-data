The pattern is 'comb'motifs on a red and pink striped bottom. The pink stripes are threaded with two pink- and two blue threads in each tablet. The red stripes with two red-, one yellow- and one blue thread in each tablet. The technique is a combination of double faced 3/1 broekn twill and Snartemo (Norway) technique. There are 10-11 tablets per cm and the weft count is 10 per cm. There are two separate fragments preserved at the mounting but the bigger seems to be two separare fragments mounted wrongly as one whole item. The width of the 'combs' are 1.7 cm. This item seems a litte bit coarser than LOAN:STEIN.588 (Lise Raeder Knudsen, August 2008).",

They were recovered from the site of Miran Fort on the eastern verge of the Taklamakan desert. At this site material was discovered in the remains of a fort held by the Tibetans during their domination of the southern Taklamakan in the 8th century AD.   \n \nThe site is also part of an area of Central Asia we now call  the Silk Road, a series of overland trade routes that crossed Asia from China to Europe. The most notable item traded was silk. Camels and horses were used as pack animals and merchants passed the goods from oasis to oasis. The Silk Road was also important for the exchange of ideas. Whilst silk textiles travelled west from China, Buddhism entered China from India in  this way. \n\nThis textile was brought back from Central Asia by the explorer and archaeologist Sir Marc Aurel Stein (1862-1943). The V&A has around 650 ancient and medieval textiles recovered from the Silk Road by Stein at the beginning of the20th century. Some are silk while others are made from the wool of a variety of different animals",

When Tibetan troops occupied the area in the late eight century AD, they built the fort to guard one of many routes through which they moved into Central Asia. In 1907, Stein excavated rubbish heaps at the fort and found wood slips, dating from the eight to the ninth century AD, which provided early examples of Tibetan writing. He also found fragments of wool rugs in bright colours and pieces of silk. The V&A holds a large number of textiles from the Miran Fort on loan, including spun wool, pattern and plain woven silk and wool, woven and spun hemp, woven horsehair, cords and painted silk.",
