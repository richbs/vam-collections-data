The modelled image of Leno is behind an open book, which forms the base of the ink well, upon whose open pages are painted the name Dan Leno in copperplate lettering.  Leno's face is painted in an ivory tone paint, and his dress is a brown base, with a squared yellow pattern and a green ruffled collar, trimmed with an orange painted rose.  His painted black hair, some of which is drawn up into a bun on the top of his head, is modelled and painted as if decorated with a green ribbon around the bun, while two plaits are modelled as if  fastened together with a bow at the centre of his back.  At this point there is a hinge, allowing the head section to tip backwards, revealing a hollow in which sits a small clear glass inkwell..",

            "public_access_description": "This unusual object is a souvenir inkwell in the shape of the much-loved music hall and pantomime performer Dan Leno (1860-1904). The hinged head section opens to reveal a glass ink well. Leno is dressed as Sister Anne, the role he played in the pantomime Blue Beard by J. Hickory Wood and Arthur Collins at Drury Lane Theatre, 27 December 1901. Manufactured as a souvenir, its production bears witness to Leno's enormous popularity.\n\nLeno was born George Galvin in London, the son of the music hall singers known as Mr and Mrs Wilde. After his father's death, his mother married William Grant, whose stage name was Leno, and Dan Leno appeared at the age of four with his brother Jack and his uncle Johnny Danvers, dancing in public houses all over England. By the age of 18 Dan was a champion clog-dancer and was engaged by George Conquest with Danvers for pantomime at London's Surrey Theatre. In 1889 he went to Drury Lane Theatre where he excelled as pantomime Dame, returning for several years as Sister Anne, and Widow Twankey.  He continued to appear in music hall where he specialised in long rambling anecdotes of incidents involving himself and his family. In 1901 he performed for King Edward VII at Sandringham, after which he was dubbed 'the King's Jester'.",
