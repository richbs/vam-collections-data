The tomb and gardens were renovated between 1902 and 1909 and again in 2002. Today the circular intersection seen here in front of the west gate is a square. Beyond the gateway on the right-hand side are the Afsarwala Mosque and Afsarwala Tomb. \n\nHumayan\u2019s tomb was the first garden-tomb to be built in India. The Qu\u2019ran refers to the concept of paradise as a garden and garden-tombs symbolically bring the deceased to rest forever in paradise. \n\nHere the garden is of a classic Persian \u2018char-bagh\u2019 design and covers an area of 30 acres. It consists of a walled-in garden subdivided into four walkways which have a narrow water channel running along the centre of them. Each of the four quadrants is subdivided into eight plots with smaller causeways, with rectangular or octagonal pools marking the intersections. \n\nThe British photographer Samuel Bourne lived and worked in India between 1862 and 1869. During this time he toured the Himalayas and travelled through the subcontinent, photographing its landscape, architecture and historical sites. He set up a studio in Simla with Charles Shepherd and sold his prints sold to an eager public both in India and Britain.",

It consists of a walled-in garden subdivided into four walkways which have a narrow water channel running along the centre of them. Each of the four quadrants is subdivided into eight plots with smaller causeways, the intersections being marked by rectangular or octagonal pools. \n\nThe \u2018char-bagh\u2019 design was introduced into India by the emperor Babur. Humayan\u2019s tomb was the first garden-tomb to be built in India, the garden being designed as an integral part of the tomb. The concept of paradise as a garden is referred to in the Quran and garden-tombs symbolically bring the emperor to rest forever in paradise. \n\nThe tomb and gardens were renovated in 1902-1909 and again in 2002. Today the circular intersection seen here in front of the west gate is a square. In the photograph several monuments can be seen beyond the gateway. On the right hand side are the Alsarwala Mosque and Afsarwala Tomb",
