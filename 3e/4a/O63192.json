Livry, one of the last Romantic ballerinas, trained at the Paris Op\u00e9ra, and later under one of the greatest Romantic dancers Marie Taglioni, who saw in her the ethereal lightness for which she herself was famous. At sixteen Livry appeared in the title role of La Sylphide, the role originally created for her mentor. In 1860 Taglioni choreographed Le Papillon for Livry, a ballet in which a girl is turned into a butterfly by an evil fairy. The spell is eventually broken after she is attracted to a flame which burns her wings. \n\nTragically the plot of the ballet foreshadowed Emma Livry's death at the age of twenty from burns sustained after her dress caught fire. In her day the stage was illuminated by gas jet footlights which made performance dangerous.  Fabric could be fireproofed, but Livry, like many dancers, did not like this as it made the fabric stiff and thus less ethereal on stage.",

By 1860, ballet had been in decline for a decade and Taglioni hoped that it would be revitalised by the young dancer and that a French dancer would be developed to rival the great Italian virtuosi of the period.  Tragically, Livry died in 1862 of burns sustained when her dress caught fire during a rehearsal for another ballet.  She was twenty years old.  \nThe figure came to the Museum as part of the Cyril Beaumont Bequest.",
