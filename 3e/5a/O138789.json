According to Houthuesen's biographer, the clown became a symbolic figure for the artist, inseparable in spirit from an artist and a poet, and many of his works portray the clown as philosopher and saint.\n\nAlbert Houthuesen (1903-1979) was born in Amsterdam but came to London with his mother in 1912 after the death of his father.  After attending  the Royal College of Art, he became a teacher and subsequently a full-time artist.  His work covered a wide range of subjects and mediums but he always loved the theatre, dance and clowns, and was inspired to make his first clown drawings in 1944 after meeting the Hermans, a family of Russian Jewish clowns.",
