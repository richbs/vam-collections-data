III, unnumbered pages, entry for 'Castle Howard' (said to be the original of the Godefroy engraving of 1794, wrongly identified as of Flatman); Foster 1903, pl. XXV; Williamson 1904, vol.

II, p. 109; Kennedy 1917, p. 22; Long 1929, p. 155 ('a very good miniature, not harsh as are some of his works'); Long 1930, p. 28, fig. 48; Reynolds 1947, p. 67, pl. IIf (dismissing the identification as a self-portrait); Foskett 1972, vol. I, p. 273; <i>Summary Catalogue</i> 1981 , p. 22; Bayne- Powell 1985, p. 84 (as exemplifying the authentic self-portraits). \n\nFormerly believed to be a self-portrait, probably on the grounds of some similarity with the subject of the Godefroy engraving, as first pointed out in print by Lord Ronald Gower. Long's description of the miniature as <i>The Painter</i> and <i>The Artist Himself </i> in the Handlist of 1930 is, however, curious. For already in 1919 he had compared the rival self-portraits with the various engraved likenesses and concluded that the only authentic miniature self-portrait was Cat. No. 130, then in the Buccleuch Collection. It was left to Carl Winter in May 1938, when he was working on the subject in connection with the purchase of Cat. No. 130 in memory of Long, to re-label this miniature as Portrait of a Gentleman, formerly thought to represent IF. Finally, Reynolds collected all the material relating to the self-portraits, including the oil-paintings, for the article in the Burlington Magazine, which remains the definitive account. (1) \n\nAs Reynolds pointed out, the Godefroy image is actually taken not from this miniature, but from the miniature still in the Buccleuch Collection; (2) there said to represent Sir Henry Vane. The latter, dated 1661, together with the Charles Beale of 1660, the Samuel Woodforde of 1661, this miniature of 1662, and arguably the Unknown Woman (Cat. No. 118) of 1661, are very similar to one another in style, and all of them may represent close friends of the artist, some perhaps the same sitter more than once. In that case, could the sitter for this miniature be another portrait of Charles Beale? He seems to be represented as a somewhat older man than the <i>Charles Beale</i> of two years earlier in Cat. No. 117. Allowing for the time difference, the features, including the suggestion of Beale's double chin and three characteristic warts, (3) are reconcilable. \n\n1 Reynolds 1947. \n2 Kennedy 1917, p. 39, no.
