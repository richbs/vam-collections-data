Italian goldsmiths were expert at making a little material go a very long way.    \n\nAll Italian women wore gold earrings.  If they could not afford real gold, they wore gilt metal.  The shapes varied widely in different places.  This earring comes from the Abruzzi.  It is based on an 18th century girandole earring, but the use of imitation pearls made of glass is typical of traditional jewellery of the 19th century.  If it was too heavy for the wearer, she could thread a ribbon through the loop at the top of the wire, to help relieve the strain on the ear-lobe.\n\nIt was bought as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867, where it was described as forming part of the traditional bridal gifts.",
