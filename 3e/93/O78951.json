In his Collection of Designs for Household Furniture and Interior Decoration (1808) George Smith praised their 'great taste', 'elegance' and 'costly materials'. \n\nPeople\nThis chair comes from a set of ten that were probably made for Leigh Court near Bristol, a house designed by Thomas Hopper (1776-1856)  in the ancient Greek Ionic style. \n\nMaterials & Making\nThe frame of the armchair is made of painted, gilded and carved beech, and its seat of cane. The loose cushion is covered in a modern silk damask, the design based on fashionable textiles of about 1805.\n\nTime\nSmith's Collection of Designs for Household Furniture and Interior Decoration (1808) borrowed ideas from the illustrations of Household Furniture and Interior Decoration by Thomas Hope (1769-1831), published a year earlier. This thus helped to popularise Hope's designs among cabinet-makers and their clients.",

The Museum's armchair may have been part of a set, possibly made for the collector Philip John Miles, for whom the architect Thomas Hopper built Leigh Court, Somerset, in 1814. The set subsequently became part of the collection of his son, John William Miles, at Forde Abbey, Dorset, and was illustrated there in the Tapestry Room in an article, 'Forde Abbey - II', <u>Country Life</u>, 10 July 1909, pp.55-56.
