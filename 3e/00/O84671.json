The condition of the inner stile and bottom rail on each panel is noticeably better that the outer one, and these might have been replaced, though it might be explained by their having occupied a more protected position. The top (inner) rail of each panel has a horizontal, rectangular mortice and double peg holes angled from below to hold a tenon (missing). No traces of paint found.",

Sir Richard was a faithful officer of King Henry VIII (ruled 1509\u201347) and made several visits to France. In 1525 he was made treasurer of the town and marches of Calais. Weston\u2019s eclectic taste for the fashions of mainland Europe is evident in the architecture of his house, which survives, though altered. From the French style of the panels, it is likely that they were either imported from France or made by a French-trained craftsman working in England.",

            "history_note": "Gothic: Art for England 1400-1547 (London 2003), cat.no. 151, p. 288 (Charles Tracy):\n\"Sutton Place, Guildford (Surrey), from where these panels are supposed to have come, was built in the mid 1520s by Sir Richard Weston (Harrison 1888).  He was a faithful officer of Henry VIII, and is distinguished by having retained the king's affections throughout his reign.  In 1518 he was appointed as on of the embassy sent to France, and in 1520 he took part at the meeting with Francis I, known as the Field of Cloth of Gold.  In 1523 he served in the French War under the Duke of Suffolk.  Two years later he was made treasurer of the town and marches of Calais.  Weston's eclectic continental taste is evident in the architecture of his house.  \n\n\"From the style of these panels, it is clear that they were either imported or made by a denizened foreign craftsman.  The tracery is French, rather than Flemish, and can be seen in muted form on French chests in England (Tracy 2001, pls. 122-3).  Adapted to a different medium, it recalls the flickering incandescence of the northern French Flamboyant style, as is typified by the early sixteenth-century portion of the west front of Rouen Cathedral.\"\n\n\nTracy suggests that the screens came from an internal screen. Hall screens as described by Wood (below) all tend to be much less refined, and even when built in the 16th century fairly traditional. One of their purposes was to limit draughts in a busy area, so highly refined, pierced panels would not perhaps be appropriate. However, the evidence on the panels that they were fitted with some kind of catch at about waist height, and the empty mortices in the top (?) rails suggest that another possible origin is that they might have served as part of an internal porch (possibly as return walls joined above head-height by another horizontal panel).",
