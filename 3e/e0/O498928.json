At the edge, a ''classical scroll'' border is incised and gilt on black. Round the well are numerous bats flying amongst clouds, incised, polychromed and gilt; and round the rim are four shaped panels with floral scrollwork and bats, reserved on a key-diaper ground in yellow. The underside of the rim and the sides are decorated with bats and swastikas among clouds and with cranes among clouds respectively.",
