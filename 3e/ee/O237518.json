Cyril Cooke is quoted as saying, 'My uncle, a Yorkshireman, was a brilliant caricaturist who was in personal touch with all the celebrities visiting the Palace Theatre and Blackpool.... At one time he had a commission to produce groups for the Blackpool Illuminations.'  These caricatures appear to have been done for George Cooke's own amusement, since it was he who collected them, and got the subjects to autograph them for him.",
