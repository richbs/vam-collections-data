In the event two panels were not used and were given to the museum by the artist's sister, Ida Forbes-Robertson, in 1986. The others were still in situ in the Tea Room of the Waldorf Hotel at the time of acquisition, when the hotel was part of the Forte group. Since that time the hotel has changed ownership twice; it was bought by Le Meridien in 1994 and by the Hilton group in 2005, at which time the hotel was undergoing extensive refurbishment. At some point, probably as a result of the 2005 refurbishment, the murals were removed. Their present whereabouts is unknown. \n \nThe two V&A panels are painted in a Chinoiserie style, fashionable in the 1930s, characterised by stylised landscapes of steep rocky mountains and tall, elegant trees.",
