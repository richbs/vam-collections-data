Abrams, Inc. with The Baltimore Museum of Art, 1997, pp. 127-128., cat.no. 24, ill.\nThe importance placed on the study of ornament led to the acquisition of both original pieces of architectural decoration (cat.23) and casts such as these. All six were taken from Santa Maria de' Miracoli, an early Renaissance church in Venice. These casts were part of an extensive assemblage of 487 such fragments purchased in 1851, among the earliest casts acquired by the Museum as \"a collection originally made for the use of Schools of Design under the Direction of the Board of Trade.\" Later in the 1850s, when the collection was moved to South Kensington, the casts were supplemented with composite photographs of other, related pilasters, and around 1900 such casts were being displayed alongside photographs showing fuller views of the buildings from which the details were taken (fig.74).Some of the casts from Santa Maria de' Miracoli were discussed and illustrated in Ralph Nicholson Wornum's Catalogue of Ornamental Casts in the Possession of the Department, 3rd Division, The Renaissance Styles, published in 1854. Wornum described the fa\u00e7ade of the church as \"one of the most remarkable in Italy as a monument of the florid Cinque-cento arabesque, and is in itself an admirable exponent of the style\". Much of this collection of casts was photographed in groups in 1893-94. Examples of ornament were among the casts that the Government Schools of Design supplied to provincial art schools. The firm of Brucciani & Co., which produced many of the Museum's casts, including that of Portico de la Gloria (cat.25), continued to issue these until 1922 when, on the company's failure, the workshop was taken over by the Museum, which continued to issue casts until 1951 (fig.75). Although modernist reforms to the art school curriculum meant that drawing from casts was no longer considered a necessary part of an artist's training during the 1960s and 1970s, a renewed interest in the casts has developed among both artists and art historians in the past fifteen years. This shift is reflected in the refurbishment of the cast courts (see fig.52) in the early 1980s and the active use now made of them.\n\nDIANE BILBEY",
