The skin stretched over it was 'rosy-coloured'. When beaten, the drum disturbed the birds that were to be the falcons' prey. The swirling bands on the body each contain a different pattern.\n\nThis piece illustrates a new type of brassware with fine, engraved decoration that emerged in Iran around 1550. Human and animal motifs, absent since before 1400, reappeared. Stylised plants and other ornament appeared in relief against a hatched ground, originally filled with a black compound. The decoration was often arranged in bands or cartouches that matched the shape of the object. Poetic inscriptions in the elegant \u2018nasta\u2019liq\u2019 style of Persian calligraphy were also common.",
