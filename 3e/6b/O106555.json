It was revived in Europe during the Renaissance, and again in the 18th and 19th centuries.  Cameos and intaglios were prized and collected, sometimes as symbols of power and mounted in jewelled settings, sometimes as small objects for private devotion or enjoyment. This intaglio probably represents a popular subject, the Greek mythological character Methe, who personifies intoxication.  She is the companion of Dionysos, and is often shown as she is here, part-naked and about to drink from a drinking bowl.",

Although the gemstone collection is not as comprehensive as that found at the Natural History Museum, it is of particular historic interest as its formation pre-dates the development of many synthetic stones and artificial enhancements. All the stones were mounted as rings before they came to the Museum.  Some are held in the Sculpture Section, other more elaborately mounted ones in the Metalwork Section.\n\nAs well as being a clergyman, collector and dillettante, the Reverend Townshend wrote poetry.  He met Robert Southey in 1815 and through him the Wordsworths, the Coleridges and John Clare.  He was a friend of Charles Dickens and dedicatee of his novel 'Great Expectations'.\n\nHistorical significance: This gem compares closely to other engraved gems representing Methe.  For analogies see Hermitage, St Petersburg inventory numbers 2275 (Julia Kagan, Antique Intaglios in the Hermitage Collection, 1976, p.71, no.104), 2268, 3619, 4400, 4555;  also Museo Archeologico, Florence, Reinach, pl.19.",
