Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. Above all they had to have the means of attaching the cord. In this example, there are a pair of holes (himotoshi) on the bottom of the sandal.  Although netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated is the katabori (shape carving). This is a three- dimensional carving, such as this netsuke. \n\nIn Japanese mythology Raijin is portrayed, as within this netsuke, as a horned demon with humanistic features and a thunder drum. This netsuke is lively in its depiction as Raijin is poised looking through the clouds. Japanese and Chinese mythology and folklore provided a rich source of inspiration for Japanese carvers due to the rich diversity and creativity of the subjects.",
