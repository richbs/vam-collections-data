The combination of costly materials such as rock crystal and agate with demanding techniques like translucent enamel was typical of the greatest commissions and a similar dish with the arms of Pope Leo X (in office 1513-1521) is in the Schatzkammer (Treasure House) in Munich. The origin of this set is not known but it was probably made for the private chapel of a cardinal or a Roman patrician family. \n\nThe cross is engraved with the crucifix and the symbols of the four evangelists. The panels on the base are engraved with the Entombment of Christ, the Resurrection of Christ and the Harrowing of Hell. The engraving on the crystal is attributed to the Italian artist Valerio Belli (around 1468-1546), a friend of the artists Raphael and Michelangelo, who carried out commissions for two popes. \n\nThe set remained together until the early 19th century when it was divided up. The cross was acquired by the museum in 1864 and the candlesticks were given by Leopold de Rothschild in 1920, reuniting the set after nearly a century of separation.",

            "history_note": "The origin of this set is not confirmed but it was possibly made for the private chapel of a cardinal or a patrician family in Rome. A pamphlet describing the candlesticks and accompanying cross published in Venice in 1820 claims they were made for Francois I of France although ended up in the collection of the Grimani family of Venice. This provenance has not yet been investigated. \n\nAll three pieces were in Paris by 1835 when they entered the collection of Louis Debruge-Dumenil (1787-1838). After his death they were sold and later entered the collection of Baron Lionel de Rothschild. The cross was taken apart and parts of it were sold at different times to several dealers including London dealer John Webb who purchased back the majority of the piece and reassembled it with minor additions. It was acquired by Prince Petr Soltikoff and sold at the sale of his collection in 1861. The Museum acquired it in 1864. The candlesticks were given to the Museum in 1920 by Marie de Rothschild, wife of the late Leopold de Rothschild, reuniting the set.\n\nFor more information about the 1820 pamphlet and subsequent 19th object history see Clive Wainwright's article listed in References.\n\nHistorical significance: This altar candlestick, with its pair (M.61-1920) and an altar cross (757-1864), are considered some of the most magnificent and sumptuous surviving examples of Italian goldsmiths' work from the 16th century. The combination of costly materials such as rock crystal and agate with demanding techniques like translucent enamel and fine engraving was typical of commissions from high profile clients. A similar dish with the arms of Pope Leo X (in office 1513-1521) is in the Schatzkammer (Treasure House) in Munich.",

            "historical_context_note": "<font -i>Following biographical information taken from The Grove Dictionary of Art:</font>\n\nThe candlesticks and cross are attributed to Valerio Belli (c. 1468-1546), an Italian gem-engraver, goldsmith and medallist. The most important part of his career was spent in Rome, where he worked for Pope Clement VII and his successor Paul III. In Rome Belli was a well-established member of artistic and literary circles, associating, for example, with Michelangelo and the humanist scholar Pietro Bembo. He specialized in cutting gems and crystal and in carving dies for coins and medals. His best-known works are those made for his papal patrons, many consisting of or incorporating carvings in rock crystal or semiprecious stones. No confirmed specimens of his work as a goldsmith survive, but he is called \u2018aurifex\u2019 in contemporary documents and may have made the settings for his carved gems.",
