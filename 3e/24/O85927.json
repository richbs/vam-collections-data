They are admired for their monumental size, accomplished potting and well-planned decoration. This relatively early basin has a lower foot and its colour scheme is restricted to blue-and-white. The outside is decorated with large-scale Chinese clouds and leafy scrolls. The interior is organised around a six-pointed knotwork design.\n\nThe small town of Iznik in north-west Anatolia has given its name to some of the most accomplished ceramics produced in the Islamic Middle East. In the mid 15th century, potters there specialised in modest earthenware imitations of Chinese blue-and-white porcelain. But in the 1460s or 1470s, under the patronage of Sultan Mehmet the Conqueror, they began to manufacture bowls, dishes and other pieces of fritware that were elegant in shape and decoration. These wares were often very large.",

The impetus for the Ottoman ceramics industry was the taste for imported Chinese blue-and-white porcelains. Several of the decorative features of this bowl \u2013 such as the knots and cloud collars on the interior \u2013 demonstrate the influence of Chinese design. This is an early piece, made before the introduction of turquoise to the Iznik palette in the 1520s. Its profile is also different from some other footed bowls, suggesting the shape had not yet been standardised.",
