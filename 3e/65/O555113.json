A rejection of the hi-tech, this bathroom has a more ordinary look, rather than a machine for washing in. Influenced by the Swedish style, it has a pine-slated bench, like those found in Scandinavian saunas and which became popular in Britain during the 1970s. The inclusion of wooden, freestanding furniture, such as the traditional kitchen chair seen here, was a major shift. From the early 1980s many bathrooms in Britain looked like this, due to its ease to assemble and cheapness. The rubber duck on the side of the bath is an example of the more humorous decorative elements which became popular from this period. The minimal, uncluttered look suggests a clean and fresh, healthy feel, and also appealed to the austere and traditional elements of the British consumer market. This bathroom is definitely, however, for the modern lifestyle with an electric hairdryer in the cupboard.\"",
