That town was already established as a centre for skilled metalwork by the 17th century; locksmiths, button and buckle makers were using brass before the end of the 17th century and brass founding was established there by the 1690s. After 1700 the numbers of brass founders increased rapidly and by the end of the 18th century the town had 71 separate brass foundries. Birmingham had become the centre of brass manufacturing in Britain, producing a vast range of domestic utensils for a national and international market.\n\nThis needle case is a typical product of that industry. It is made in the shape of a woman at prayer, with its lower part decorated to look like a dress.",
