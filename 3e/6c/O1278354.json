These two 20 Neuro \u2018banknotes\u2019 are from his latest project/performance. He has described the \u2018Neuro\u2019 as \u201ca hypothetical currency for British people with a neurosis about Europe\u201d and as part of the life-cycle of the work the artist has donated \u2018Neuro\u2019 notes to selected museums and galleries via their transparent collecting boxes \u2013 which also constitutes a public \u2018display\u2019 of the work. Distribution and display of the work is of course limited for legal reasons. One note was donated to the V&A in this way, and the artist has donated a second pristine example by sending it direct to the print curator.\n\nKindness was born in Belfast, but lives and works in London. This project was prompted by his fascination with the differing attitudes to the EU in Britain and Ireland. He has said that he believes that like the divisions in Northern Ireland, the problem that the British have with their European identity is more psychological than political. He also feels that the antipathy to Europe is directly connected to a discomfort with the idea of any authority taking precedence over the British Crown. For this reason his \u2018Neuro\u2019 notes incorporate the Queen\u2019s head.",
