It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years. Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nThe American vaudeville star Will Mahoney made his first stage appearance as a dancer  in Washington, aged eight, and became one of the best-known performers on the American variety stage.  He came to London in the 1920s where he appeared in George White's Scandals at the London Palladium (1926) and in 1931 at the Palladium again in Earl Carroll's Sketch Book.  He appeared in pantomime in 1934 at the Palace Theatre Manchester as the Cat in Puss in Boots and toured variety theatres in 1935 in Radio New York and in 1937 and 1938 in the variety show Ride 'Em Cowboy. During the war Will Mahoney and his wife performed in Australia where his act included comedy sketches, humorous songs, and dancing on a xylophone playing tunes with his feet.  He was also known as the 'kilt-wearing tap dancer'.",
