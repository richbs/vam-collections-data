Each earring consists of a hoop of wire, open in one place, with a loop at one end and a hook at the other.  The lower part of the hoop is covered with a sheath of thin sheet gold, decorated with gold ribbons and applied wire, and red, blue, green and white enamel.  There are four pendants, each of two pearls arranged vertically on a wire, hanging from the lower edge.  The main pendant hangs from the centre of this sheath.  It is shaped like a stylised vase with a wide shallow sphere at the base and an open filigree bead at the top joined to it by a plain collar.  Four struts of flat ribbon link the perimeters of each sphere on the outside.  There is a white enamel rosette on the top of the bottom sphere, between the struts, and the base of the bottom sphere is decorated with blue and white enamel.  The struts are enamelled green.  There are eight pearl pendants, like those attached to the top part of the earring, hanging from the circumference of the bottom sphere, and a ninth from the centre of its base.",

Earrings with these jar-shaped pendants are also found in the Greek islands of the Aegean, such as the Cyclades and Dodecanese, where they are sometimes enamelled.",
