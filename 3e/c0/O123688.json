He may have studied with Ferdinand Elle (ca.1585-1637/40) and Georges Lallemand (died 1636) and was influenced by the second Ecole of Fontainebleau. He went to Italy and arrived in Rome, following a visit to Venice, in March 1624 where he spent the rest of his life. He became a member of the Accademia di S Luca by 1632 and received commissions from important collectors in France and Italy, producing history, religious and landscape paintings. His most famous pupil was his brother-in-law Gaspard Dughet (1615-1675). \n\nThis painting is a copy after Poussin\u2019s Venus Presenting Arms to Aeneas housed in the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts, Rouen. It depicts Venus, attended by putti and a swan, showing her son Aeneas the arms she had have forged for him. Aeneas is presented here as a Greek hero with a large cloak wrapped around him and a helmet while reclining figures on the ground symbolised fluvial divinities. This painting is a good example of Poussin\u2019s mythological subject and Classical baroque art, which combined movement with a symmetrical balance.",

He went to Rome in 1623, returning to Paris in 1639 at the invitation of the Secretary of State, to work for the king, but in 1642 left for Rome, where he remained until his death. He stands for the revival of interest in classical painting in France; his style was formed under the influence of Raphael and the Antique. \n\nAfter Nicolas POUSSIN  \n\n287\nVENUS BRINGING ARMS TO AENEAS \n(Virgil, <i>Aeneid</i>, VIII. 616-8) \nCanvas \n41 \u00bd  x 50 \u00bd (105 x 128) \nIonides Bequest \nCAI.21 \n\nAn old, probably contemporary, copy of the painting by Poussin of 1639 in the Muse\u00e9 des Beaux-Arts, Rouen (105 x 142 cm.).  It is the only old copy listed by Blunt.  A different treatment of the same subject by Poussin is in the Art Gallery of Toronto (Blunt, no. 190). The subject is treated in a similar way in an engraving by Pietro Testa (Bartsch, xix, 65, 1006). \n\nCondition.

Bequeathed by Constantine Alexander Ionides, 1900.\n\nHistorical significance: Formerly thought to be by Poussin himself, this painting is a reduced and partial copy after a composition currently housed in the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts, Rouen (Inv. 866.1), which Poussin painted in Rome for his friend, the painter Jacques Stella (1596-1657), in 1639.\nIt depicts Venus, Goddess of Love and Beauty, presenting arms forged by Vulcan, God of Fire, to her son Aeneas, surviving hero from Troy and future founder of the city of Rome. The story was narrated by the ancient Roman author Virgil in the </i>Aeneid</i. The goddess is depicted flying in the air and supported by putti while she is accompanied by a swan, her traditional attribute. She is pointing at the arms, which Aeneas, depicted in the guise of a Greek hero, discovers with surprise. On the ground, three reclining fluvial divinities symbolised rivers with their upside down amphorae. \nAlthough the present copy is slightly smaller in dimensions than the original, it depicts the scene from a closer point of view and eliminates partially the oak from which Aeneas' arms hang. The colour scheme has also been modified, Venus' mantle being originally white became here red. The overall copy is warmer in tones while the Rouen painting shows a cooler tonality, almost silvery in several areas, especially on Venus' body. \nAccording to Christopher Wright, this subject matter is rare in Poussin's output although it was quite popular during the 17th century. However another earlier version is housed in the Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto and is based on a similar compositional idea with perhaps a greater focus on the landscape and smaller figures.",

            "historical_context_note": "History painting, i.e. depictions of non recurring events based on religious, classical, literary or allegorical sources, particularly developed in Italy during the Renaissance (15th-16th centuries). History painting could include religious themes, or depictions of momentous recent events, but the term was most frequently associated with Classical subject-matter. However a renewed impetus was given to religious subjects after the Council of Trent (1545-63), which stipulated new iconographical programmes. The development of art treatises, in which the compositional rules guiding the art of painting were discussed also notably, influenced the evolution of history painting. From around 1600 history painting's principal rivals: still-life, landscape and genre painting began to emerge as independent collectable genres. Furthermore, the Rococo taste for the ornamental in the early 18th century prioritised the decorative quality of history painting, so that subject matters became more entertaining than exemplary. There was a renewed interest in history painting during the Neo-Classical period after which the taste for such pictures faded towards the end of the 19th century when an innovative approach to the image was led by the Symbolists and was developed further by subsequent schools in the early 20th century.",
