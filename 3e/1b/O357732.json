She established a salon which was frequented by writers and the military. She was considered to be one of the great international beauties, with extremely pale, almost transparent skin and golden hair. She was frequently the subject of articles in the New York Times during the early 20th century. Her clothes were purchased from couturiers in London, Paris, and New York, and demonstrated an elegantly avant-garde approach to style.\n\nThe Marquis of Anglesea who owned the waistcoat was probably Henry Cyril Paget (16 June 1875-14 March 1905), the 5th Marquis of Anglesey from 1898 to 1905. Known as the \"Dancing Marquess\" due to his love of performing in his own private theatrical performances, Paget was a notorious figure who led an extravagant lifestyle, spending large amounts of money on extravagant clothing and jewels. Despite an income of \u00a3110,000 a year (equivalent to \u00a355 million today), Paget was declared bankrupt in 1904, with debts of \u00a3544,000, and his wardrobe and jewels were sold to raise funds to pay his creditors.",
