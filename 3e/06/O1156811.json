It starred George Formby Senior, the father of the more famous comedian and singer of the same name, and a variety of other performers including Arthur Astill, billed here in his early career as 'the Whistling Ploughboy'. By the 1940s Arthur Astill was on the halls in a variety act with Gwen Fontaine, which involved the mimicry of children, and of birds and animals, obviously using his whistling skills.\n\nThis hanging card was part of a collection made by Arthur Astill (1887-1962) of publicity material from theatres where he and his wife Gwen Fontaine appeared. The names of the best-known performers appear in larger or bolder type-face, while George Formby (1875-1921), the performer James Booth who took his stage name from a Lancashire town, was popular enough to have his name printed most prominently on the handbill, and vertically down each side, with the slogan: 'John Willie, Come On' along the bottom. This was the title of the song he wrote and performed about a Lancashire man coming to London for the day with his wife. It was published by Francis, Day & Hunter in 1909 and recorded by George Formby Jnr. in 1926.",
