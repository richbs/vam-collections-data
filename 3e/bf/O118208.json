It is probably for the border of a petticoat to a woman's open gown or for the border of the gown itself.  Women wore gowns that were open in front to reveal the petticoat.  This design is for the embroidery along the border above the bottom hem of a petticoat, and also for such a border on the gown itself. The design repeated so that this pattern continued around the border. There is a similar motif of bows with crossed tassels on a length of mull (a light muslin) embroidered in coloured silks in a private collection.",

The names of the female clients inscribed on the designs were of the aristocracy, gentry or from wealthy families that moved in the upper reaches of society.  They had homes in the country and came to London for the season.  Retailers who sold such designs were linen drapers and lacemakers, both of which categories existed in London and were available to the clients. Many pattern drawers worked in London where their trade proved a lucrative business during the season. The similarity of some of the designs from this group to those by Mr Styart whose designs were published in <u>The Fashionable Magazine</u> in London in 1786 does support the argument that these designs came from a retailer's archive based in London.",
