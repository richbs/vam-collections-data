Motifs like this Egyptian-style head were often used as decorative details in Regency design.\n\nPeople\nThe firm of Cope & Timmins was established about 1760. They had addresses in both London and Birmingham, with Birmingham being specified by 1890 as the manufactory. The firm is still in business today (2001), producing brass fittings.\n\nDesign & Designing\nDecorative brass fittings for furniture were among the staple products of the Birmingham and London brass founders during the 18th and 19th centuries. An enormous range of decorative furniture fittings was available, and many of the same patterns recur. There was no registered right to any design in Britain during the 18th century, unlike in Paris where metalworkers enjoyed the protection of their guilds and, after 1766, were able to protect their patterns by law. In Britain, however, manufacturers borrowed freely from each other. Popular patterns were supplied by a large number of manufacturers and persisted for many years.",
