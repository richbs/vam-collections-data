It features decoration of an upside-down heart-shaped palmette which forms the base of a tree, whose branches develop into scrolling roundels inhabited by symmetrically-placed gazelles (on the bottom) and birds (at the centre), with a crown of leaves at the top. The animals hold plant shoots in their mouths, which is a characteristic of ivories produced under the patronage of the <i>taifa</i> rulers of Toledo, as is the heart-shaped palmette. The style of the carving is very similar to that on the 'Palencia casket', which is now in the Museo Arqueol\u00f3gico Nacional (Madrid). This was signed by the craftsman, 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Zayyan, and dated 441 AH / 1049-50 AD. The centre of production was at Cuenca, a small town near Toledo, as we know from the inscriptions on other extant ivories from this workshop.\n\nThe small rectangular box near the top of the plaque would originally have been left uncarved, and the casket's lockplate would have been attached here. However, this plain area of ivory was recarved at a later date, probably in the 13th century, to bear the bust of an angel giving a blessing. This speaks of the survival of this object, which must have found its way into the Treasury of some Cathedral in Northern Spain. This was the means of preservation of many ivory caskets made in Al-Andalus, and several were 'restored' by having missing sections replaced by enamel plaques.",
