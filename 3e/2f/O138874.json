As she describes it: 'One of the most memorable images of Bush\u2019s state visit to London is his extraordinary motorcade, which would put any South American dictator to shame. Many Londoners turn out to catch a glimpse of it, but excitement soon turns to commuter fury as roads are closed without warning \u201cfor security reasons\u201d. The motorcade, flanked by bodyguards running alongside the armoured cars, is the talk of the town, and appears in all the papers, with extensive graphics and photographs.'\n\n'Marf' drew daily topical cartoons for the Evening Standard between March 2002 and August 2005, moving to the Londoner's Diary page in August 2003. The drawings cover key political and social issues of the period, providing a vivid and often hilarious response to the main news of the day. The Evening Standard is London's only evening newspaper, publishing up to five editions a day. In Marf's own words: 'The cartoonist needs to keep up with the rapid pace of event.'",
