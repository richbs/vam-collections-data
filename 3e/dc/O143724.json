In the 1970s artist-jewellers began to make wearable art in glass. In the making these unique sculptural forms, they pushed the materials to their technical limits. \n\nLinda MacNeil's fascination for making jewellery began in her childhood when she created wire jewellery. She studied at the Philadelphia College of Art, and in Boston at the Massachusetts College of Art. In the early seventies she began using glass for jewellery, which was to become her trademark. Today glass is the primary material MacNeil works with in combination with metals in different techniques. Through acid-polishing and engraving she achieves a distinctive style. These surface treatments allow her to exploit the possibility of opacity or translucency in glass. Her inspirations include Art Deco and Egyptian jewellery.",
