The play is not named but a tragic play named  Radamiste et Zenobie does appear to have been performed at various times in the late 18th and early 19th century. \n\nBoth Mdlle. Sainval (real name Marie-Blanche Alziary de Roquefort) and le Kain (1729-1778) were members of the Com\u00e9die Fran\u00e7aise. \n\nThe Com\u00e9die Fran\u00e7aise or Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Fran\u00e7ais, state theatre of France was officially established by Louis XIV in 1680 in a decree which ordered the merger of the two French companies of actors at Paris, the troupe of the H\u00f4tel Gu\u00e9n\u00e9gaud and the troupe of the H\u00f4tel de Bourgogne. In 1681 an annual grant was allotted to the company from the royal treasury and a new theatre was constructed for them. \n\nExcept for a short period between 1792-1803 (after the commencement of the French Revolution and prior to the reforms imposed by Napoleon in 1803) the company has performed without significant interruption and continues to do so to this day. \n\nA charter first signed by Napoleon in 1812 established the company as a collective organisation, in which all the permanent members (called soci\u00e9taires, or associates), share in the management of the company, while the actor who has served the longest functions as the head, or doyen.",
