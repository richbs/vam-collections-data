Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. Above all, they had to have the means for attaching a cord. Netsuke were made in a variety of forms, the most widely appreciated being the katabori (shape carving), a three-dimensional carving, such as this one in the form of beanpods.\n\nThe main inspiration for netsuke subjects was the natural world, most commonly animals, birds and plants. Although the netsuke appears simple it was, in fact, very demanding to carve a piece that was very realistic. The skill lies in creating the smooth, curved surface of the beanpods.",
