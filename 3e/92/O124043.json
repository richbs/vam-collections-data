Worked from the age of seven in a lace factory in Nottingham, but painted in his spare time, mainly portraits; seeing prints by John Martin inspired him to paint landscape. Began as a professional painter 1835, visited London 1836, and received his only formal training there 1838 - twelve lessons from the landscape painter and watercolourist James Baker Pyne. Exhibited 28 landscapes at the RA between 1838 and 1874; he always complained, with some reason it seems, that his work was badly hung. Also exhibited 33 works at the BI 1841-67 and six at the SBA 1851-78 (elected Member 1875). Moved to Liverpool 1844, exhibiting at the Liverpool Academy 1845-51 (elected Member 1847). Entered (unsuccessfully) 1847 competition for decoration of new Palace of Westminster, with 'Charles I Raising his Standard ... ' (now Nottingham Castle Museum and Art Gallery); achieved great success with one of his large views of London, 'The New Houses of Parliament, Westminster', at the BI 1858. Later works achieved high prices, his popularity culminating in the exhibition of 57 paintings to mark the opening of the Nottingham Castle Museum and Art Gallery 1878. Lived in Croydon, Surrey, 1850-3, and Thorpe Green, near Chertsey, Surrey, until 1861; finally settled in Chiswick, Middlesex, where he died 13 December 1878; his studio sale was at Christie's 23-5 March 1882. His two sons, Alfred (1844-93) and Henry Thomas (c1842-78) were also painters. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal 1869</i>, p112, 1879, p48 (obit); A Dawson <i>The Life of Henry Dawson Landscape Painter</i> 1891; B Webber <i>James Orrock, RI, Painter, Connoisseur, Collector</i> 2 vols, 1903, I, pp25-42, II p237; H C Marillier <i>The Liverpool School of Painters</i> 1904, pp114-8, 259; H Williams <i>Henry Dawson</i> Nottingham University Art Gallery exhibition catalogue 1978 \n\n<b>Rocky Landscape with River and Sheep</b> \n177-1894 Neg GF706 \nCanvas, 69.2 x 89.5 cm (27\u00bc x 35\u00bc ins) \nSigned 'H Dawson' br \nGiven by James Orrock RI 1894\n \nAlthough undated, this painting is similar in style to 'Landscape' (see 1857-1900, p68) which is dated 1840. It is reminiscent of the work of Richard Wilson, with which Dawson was familiar through the collection of his friend and patron, the Nottingham artist Frederick Carter Cooper. After Cooper's death in 1875, Dawson bought a painting by Wilson which he had seen and admired at Cooper's house early in his career. \n\nJames Orrock saw Dawson's paintings when he was living in Nottingham in 1856, at the house of William Wild, a lock-keeper and early patron of Dawson. He became a friend and patron, also acting as agent securing sales of Dawson's work to other collectors. According to Webber (I, pp29-30) Dawson painted four pictures for Orrock in 1857 and subsequent years; from their titles none are identifiable with the present work. Dawson recorded that he gave Orrock a painting in 1872, quoting a note made by Orrock: 'The Wild sunset was given to me for commissions of 200 [pounds] ... Mr Dawson saying he had never had such commissions before in his life. At first I refused any reward whatever, but Mr Dawson said he wished to present me with a picture of 20 by 30 size'. It is not recorded how or when Orrock acquired the present work. \n\nEXH: <i>Henry Dawson</i> Nottingham University Art Gallery 1978 (16)\n \nLIT: H Williams <i>Henry Dawson</i> Nottingham University Art Gallery exhibition catalogue 1978, pp27, 42-3\"",
