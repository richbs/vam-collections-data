Beech is easier to turn than walnut, and provides a good ground for staining. All three lower stretchers are also beech, and the chair would have been stained all over.\n\nThe turned twisting balusters are all original. The top section of the cresting rail and the proper right finial are replacements. The rosettes on the sides of the hand-rests might be later additions, as sytlistically they raise suspicions.
