            "history_note": "The arms are those of Swinburne quartering three others, possibly for Sir John Swinburne (d. 1706) of Capheaton, Northumberland, who succeeded his father in 1652 and was created a baronet on September 26, 1660.  Many of the earliest extant salvers of silver were made to accompany two-handled covered porringers (Oman, 1970, pls. 10, 12) and it is posible that the Gilbert salver was made for a porringer that has since been lost. Oman points out (1970, pp. 41-42) however, that: 'indistinguishable from the earliest type of salvers were fruit dishes. Of these, the earliest example is the one attributed to Christian van Vianen in the collection of the Duke of Northumberland where the embossed badge shows that it cannot have been intended to be used in conjunction with a porringer. Six 'fruite dishes' were included amongst the plate carried as a gift to Tsar Alexei by the Earl of Carlisle's embassy in 1663.' (Schroder, 1988, pp. 101, 103)\n\nProvenance: Possibly Sir John Swinburne, Bart., Capheaton, Northumberland.  Purchased from a private collection, Los Angeles, 1986.\n\nHistorical significance: This salver or fruit dish is among the earliest examples in English silver of the full-blown embossed floral style; another, of 1659, is illustrated by Brett (1996, no. 439). The style is usually associated  with Dutch goldsmiths and its popularity is attributed to a new taste for luxury introduced at the court of Charles II, the king having spent much of his earlier life in Holland. However, while this undoubtedly accelerated the acceptance of the floral style, the new taste had already begun to make an impression on English patrons during the last years of the Commonwealth.
