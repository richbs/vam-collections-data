They stood against the wall, sometimes underneath a mirror, and were often flanked by chairs.  If the room was large, it was usual to have a pair of tables or more, with the same base and either similar or complementary tops.\n\nPlaces\nThe architects William Kent and Henry Flitcroft both worked at Ditchley Park for George Henry Lee, 2nd Earl of Lichfield, between about 1736 and 1740 .  Flitcroft designed the ceilings of the drawing room and dining room, as well as chimney-pieces, internal woodwork and table frames for the house.  This table was recorded in the Green Drawing Room in the 1743 and 1772 inventories. The light, feminine nature of its design suggests that the base of the table is the work of Flitcroft not Kent.  Furniture designs by Kent are more solid and architectural by comparison.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nOne of the small oval panels decorating the top contains a harbour scene.  The ship with the red flag is that of Admiral Fitzroy Lee, Lord Lichfield's brother. The  Admiral appears to have overseen the production of the scagliola top on behalf of his brother.  He wrote from the Italian seaport of Livorno on 26 July 1726: 'I have seen this morning your table which is entirely finished only the arms and supporters which I writ to you of ten months ago, and you have not sent them yet, which is a great pity, for I'm sure it will be the finest of the sort in Europe!'",
