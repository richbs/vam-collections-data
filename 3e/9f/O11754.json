This si-bon of black velvet is edged with gold and decorated with gilt tinsel flower heads and surmounted by a gilt openwork finial. It is shaped like a close fitting cap and would have covered the ears. It lifts slightly at the back to allow for a coil of hair.\n\nStrict sumptuary laws applied to every aspect of life at the court of the Konbaung Dynasty (1752-1885). This head-dress would have been worn at a key event at which prince's ministers and their wives appeared in costumes which defined the rank they had been awarded by the king.  Its style, decorative elements and the robe with which it was worn would have established the wearer's position within the hierarchy of the Konbaung Court.",
