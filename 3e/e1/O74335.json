Designs for carpets are much rarer than those for printed cottons and other textiles. George Kingman made this design, one of 105 in an album, for a firm in Kidderminster. It is a particularly valuable indication of what the carpets must have looked like. Because of the general dirt and soot, a light-coloured carpet must have been restricted to special locations. In some cases, protective covers of plain, coarse woven cloth called \u2018druggets\u2019 would have been used. They were similar to those used for expensive upholstered furniture.",
