The foliage is in green and the design is linked by vertical meandering trails in silver gilt.  It is an open robe, and sackbacked. The hips and hem are so cut that when properly mounted it has a fan-shaped silhouette. There is no gathering at the hips and the shaping is achieved by a curved seam. The sleeves have scalloped and gathered double cuffs. Some fragments of woven silver and silver gilt braid are still stitched to the right cuff. There are some traces of attachment cotton still remaining on the remainder of the cuffs of this sleeve and on the other, so it can be presumed that both were originally so trimmed. The width of the robings, which broaden slightly towards the hem, varies in places. There are a few loose sewing threads still attached to them, and though plain now, they may once have been trimmed in some way. The bodice and sleeves are lined with silk, and slit down the centre back where there are tapes for adjustment. There are many pin marks in the silk band which faces each side of the bodice. The skirt is faced up with silk matching that of the bodice lining. Stitch marks on the sleeves lining would suggest that there once were weights inside each sleeve.\n\nPetticoat with the front only of material matching that of the gown. At the hips the shaping is gauged onto a piece of ribbed purple silk which is attached to the top. The petticoat is shaped to the figure at the centre front, and there is a purple tape waist band. The hem is faced back with white silk matching the bodice lining.",
