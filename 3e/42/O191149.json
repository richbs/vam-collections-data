            "public_access_description": "The logo of Solidarity is accompanied by the national emblem of Poland. The eagle on the emblem wears a crown, evoking the old Polish Kingdom. It is also a symbol of democratic Poland because the eagle on the emblem of the communist People\u2019s Republic of Poland lacked a crown. The logo of Solidarity acts as a second national emblem on this poster.\n\nThe Solidarity logo was designed by Jerzy Janiszewski in August 1980. The word \u2018solidarity\u2019 appeared frequently on the walls of the Gdansk Shipyard. It was also the name of the strike newsletter and soon became the official name of the Free Trade Unions. The form of the logo was inspired by the lettering of slogans written and stenciled on walls during the strike. The letters form the shape of people joined together in a dense crowd. The typical socialist motif of a leader conducting a crowd is replaced by the Polish national flag. \n\nThe logo of the trade union soon became legible and well-known spreading quickly within the borders of Poland and abroad. The Solidarity logo became the source of a typeface called \u2018Solidarics\u2019 (Solidaryca). Solidarics has become almost a Polish national typeface. It is often used for logos and slogans which refer to Poland in general as well as for content relating to themes of nationalism, freedom and democracy.  \n\nSolidarity, founded in September 1980, was the first free trade union in an Eastern Bloc country. It became the leading political force opposing the communist regime in Poland. Eventually the Polish Government was forced to negotiate with the Solidarity-led opposition, resulting in semi-free elections on 4th June 1989. This marked a crucial stage in the democratic transformation of Central and Eastern Europe.",
