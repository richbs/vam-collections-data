In this example the glass tube containing mercury is now missing, but the terms Pluie (rain) and Beau (fine) on the ceramic face indicate how the barometer was to be read. The carved swags of flowers around the top of the frame have also been damaged.\n\nThe face of this barometer bears the words Selon Toricelly, meaning according to the method of Toricelly.  This refers to Evangelista Torricelli (1608-1647) who invented the barometer in 1643.  At the top of the barometer is a Wedgwood jasper ware ceramic plaque depicting a woman holding a child, within a wreath of flowers.  This plaque design is known as 'Domestic Employment' and was designed by Lady Templeton for Josiah Wedgwood. In the last two decaded of the eighteenth century, Wedgwood plaques were much admired in France.",
