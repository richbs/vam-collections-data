The pine belly is elaborately decorated with delicate arabesque scrolls of turtleshell, framed with bands of a dog's-tooth pattern in turtleshell and mother-of-pearl. The bridge is missing. At a later date the lower parts of the sides have been cut in order to allow the belly to be bent inwards at the level of the bridge. There are five ivory hitch studs at the base of the body. \n\nThe neck is veneered with marquetry panels of scrollwork in the same materials as the decoration of the belly. The fingerboard has a formal pattern of mother-of-pearl and turtleshell triangles. Nine brass frets have been added and there are six well-worn frets set into the belly, five of them of short width. The head was originally for ten pegs, but four extra pegholes have been bored along the centre line. The pegs are now missing.",

He made this guitar in 1623 for Grand Duke Ferdinand II of Tuscany (1610 - 1670), then merely a boy of 13. Learning the lute or guitar was considered part of a prince's education at this time, and like other princely instruments this example is lavishly decorated with costly materials like ebony and ivory.\nInstead of being discarded, this majestic guitar was later converted into a 'chitarra battente', a wire strung guitar that was usually strummed with a plectrum instead of the fingertips.\n\nOn loan to the Horniman Museum.",
