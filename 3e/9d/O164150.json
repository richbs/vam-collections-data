This relief portrait seems to date from the eighteenth century as it relates to the historicising portraits of 'Worthies' produced during this period.\n\nInigo Jones (1573-1652) was one of the first great English architects. He is known primarily for introducing the Palladian style into England from Venice. In 1606 James I employed him to design scenery and costumes for masques written by Ben Johnson and performed at Court. In 1615 he was appointed Surveyor General of the Royal Buildings. His most important London buildings are the Queen's House, Greenwich (1616-1635) , the first English design to  embody Palladian principles.and the Banqueting House in Whitehall (1622). In many houses in London and the country he broke from the prevailing Jacobean style, marking a starting point for the Renaissance and Georgian periods in England. Jones, who introduced the proscenium arch to English theatre, was also famous for his spectacular settings and costumes for court masques.\nHis influence was curtailed by the English Civil War, but his work became popular again among the 18th century architects, who had a renewed interest in the work of Palladio.",
