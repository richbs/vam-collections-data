The beads on the six rows are mainly smooth silver beads, interspersed at intervals towards the centre with knobbly beads made from pyramids of granules soldered together.  The spacer and terminals are made of plain sheet silver with filigree patterns applied on the front, and the central spacer is also set with five pastes arranged vertically, two red cabochons, two turquoise, and a central red facetted paste.  The central spacer has a tiny open filigree pendant shaped like a cylindrical amulet case hanging from its lower edge, with three flat leaf-shaped filigree pendants, ending in pendent balls, hanging from that.  The necklace is strung on six strands of natural cotton, which are braided together as they emerge from the terminals to form a thick cord.",

They were particularly renowned for the quality of their filigree work, which was worn and appreciated as much by Muslim as by Jewish women.\n\nThis type of necklace, now known as a lazem, is one of the traditional styles made by the Jewish goldsmiths.  Its main distinguishing feature is a pendent cylindrical amulet case, but this has been reduced to barely more than a decorative element in this piece.  This necklace was described as a managgeh when it was acquired in 1909.  This term is now usually used for a necklace of numerous strands of beads, without pendants, worn crossed over in the centre, but the word means \u2018choker\u2019 suggesting that it might have applied to different kinds of necklace in the past.",
