It is as much a statement of its owner's fashionable taste as a useful item of household equipment.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThis candlestick tells a complicated story of influences. Made in English bone china by an unidentified factory in Staffordshire, it imitates the style of porcelain made by the Chelsea factory at a time when the latter was itself imitating wares produced by the S\u00e9vres factory.  French styles continued to be popular  in Britain well into the 19th century.",
