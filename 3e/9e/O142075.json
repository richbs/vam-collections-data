They were held between the legs, hence the term viola da gamba, and were played with a bow that was held with the palm of the hand turned outwards. The bow was used in an 'under-arm' motion, rather than the 'over-arm' movement of a violin bow. This exerts less pressure on the string, resulting in a softer sound than made by violins or 'cellos, so viols ultimately proved less suitable for orchestral work. The maker of this viol remains unknown but the instrument was probably made in England, where the instrument flourished from the 1520s until the 1680s.\n\nOn loan to the Horniman Museum.",
