            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nMany versions of  the upholstered drawing-room armchair were made in the mid-18th century. Few chairs were entirely based on contemporary published designs. Mid-18th-century carvers were often skilled designers and very inventive.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe carver has used dolphin heads as terminals for the feet and the arms. Chippendale's design, which may have inspired the carver, used the whole dolphin - its tail visible at the top of the leg. The scale of the chair and quality of the carving indicate that this chair was part of a special commission for a set of seating furniture for a large drawing room. At least four other chairs and a footstool of the same carved design are known today.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThomas Chippendale (1718-1779) recommended tapestry or needlework for drawing-room chairs. The embroidery on this chair probably dates from the 1740s. It may have been cut down from a set of larger wall hangings and has been associated with the chair since the 1920s, when it was advertised by the London furniture dealers Moss Harris in an advertisement in Country Life magazine. The use of crossbanded mahogany on the front seat rail above the carved apron is an additional sign of quality.",

The lower part of the legs corresponds to the design for 'French chairs' in the 'Director'.\n\nDolphin legs appeared in Chippendale's 1753 design for 'French Chairs' (large, open armchairs). The maker of this chair probably based his design on Chippendale's, but made his chair much larger in scale. This suggests that it came from a very large drawing room, as such chairs were generally smaller than this one.",
