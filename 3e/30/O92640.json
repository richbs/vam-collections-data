The original was bought by the Louvre in 1858.  It was one of the most important early Romantic sculptures.\n\nThis cast, using Collas' mechanical reduction method, reproduces the large bronze shown at the Paris Salon in 1839. Although the vine leaves in the youth's hair connect with a sculptural tradition of Bacchic themes, the figure is more an illustration of contemporary Neapolitan street life.",
