The earliest pieces were designed for the domestic market. Production increased from 1650 onwards, with a large part of the industry being directed towards the making of ceramics for export to Europe. The use of a central scene surrounded by a panelled design is common among blue-and-white porcelain imported into Europe from both China and Japan. The centre of this particular dish is painted with a deer surrounded by flowering plants and a butterfly.",
