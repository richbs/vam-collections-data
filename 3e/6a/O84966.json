ISBN 1851771026\nThe following is the full text of the entry: \n\n\"20 Samuel De Wilde (1748-1832) \n<i>John Liston as Pompey in 'Measure for Measure' by William Shakespeare</i>\n\nPompey has two outdoor scenes in Measure Jar Measure and in the second of these, Act III scene ii, he is being led away to prison. The other, Act I scene ii, in which Pompey converses saucily with Mistress Overdone, was cut in the eighteenth century but largely restored by John Philip Kemble for his production in 1794. It is Pompey's first appearance in the play and <i>20</i> (Dyce 80) seems to record the event, possibly at the lines: \n\n<i>Pompey</i>: Here comes Signior Claudio, led by the provost to prison; and there's Madam Juliet. \n\nListon played Pompey for the first time at Covent Garden on 30 October 1811. Hazlitt saw him in the part in 1816 and wrote; 'We cannot say that the Clown Pompey suffered in the hands of Mr. Liston; on the contrary, he played it inimitably well. His manner of saying \"a dish of some three-pence\" was worth anything. In the scene of his examination before the Justice, he delayed and dallied, and dangled his answers, in the true spirit of the genius of his author.' \n\nListon was not noted as a Shakespearean actor and he seems to have treated his audiences to a display of broad comedy when he did attempt such roles as Pompey, the part was always billed as 'Clown', and Polonius. He was a notable Bottom in Frederick Reynolds's adaptation of <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i> at Covent Garden in 1816 and, in 1819, played one of the two Dromios in a musical version of <i>The Comedy of Errors</i>. \n\nThere is another version of 20 (Dyce 80) in the Garrick Club (434 Oil on panel 23 X 19 cm.), signed and dated 'S De Wilde 1812'. One or other was engraved in stipple by Thomas Woolnoth and published in August 1822 by Simpkin and Marshall as a plate to Oxberry's <i>New English Drama</i>. An anonymous full-length version of the picture was also engraved in stipple, publisher and date unknown. \n\nThe costume worn by Liston is not historically accurate as the doublet is made like a waistcoat. However, there is an evident attempt at sixteenth- or early seventeenth-century fashion and the audience would have appreciated the suggestion of another time. Pompey's servile profession is indicated by the blue apron. \n\nOil on panel 23.5 X 19.05 cm \n1812\nSigned: <i>S De Wilde / Pinxt 1812</i> in black oil paint (top left)\n\nProvenance: Rev.

The painting was bequeathed as part of the Dyce collection of 3347 works of art, including paintings, miniatures, watercolours and prints as well as his library of 14,000 volumes. \n\nReverend Alexander Dyce (1798-1869), literary scholar and art collector, was the son of a major, later lieutenant general in the Madras infantry of the East India Company. Raised by two maternal aunts in Aberdeen following his parent\u2019s departure for India in 1799, Dyce read classics at Exeter College, Oxford. At his father\u2019s insistence he was ordained as an Anglican priest in 1823, having rejected a career in the East India Company. He developed a career in publishing by translating Greek texts. However he is probably best known for his editions of sixteenth and seventeenth century poetry. Dyce collected many rare books covering English, Italian and Classical literature. His collection of paintings and works on paper is very varied.  In his collection of paintings, Dyce indulged his enthusiasm for the theatre, acquiring portraits of leading actors, while his drawings collection focuses on Old Master drawings from European schools. The Dyce bequest was one of the earliest of a collection of fine art given to the museum. It followed the Sheepshanks collection, which was given to the museum two years earlier in 1857. While the Sheepshanks collection was mainly of contemporary Victorian art, Dyce\u2019s collection focused on British eighteenth and early nineteenth art as well as paintings from Italian, Dutch and Flemish Schools. This bequest therefore helped to broaden the collection, which the museum was already beginning to do by purchasing works from British and Continental Schools.\n\nHistorical significance: Samuel Wilde, (1751-1832), portrait painter. He was apprenticed to his godfather, Samuel Haworth in1765to train to be a woodcarver, his father's profession. In 1769 he broke from his seven year apprenticeship to train at the Royal Academy. There he encountered the artist Johann Zoffany (1733-1810), whose theatrical portraits would later become a major influence on his own works. Little is known of de Wilde's early work. His earliest work associated with the theatre is a portrait of the actor William Shuttlewood. However de Wilde's career in theatrical portraiture began in 1791 with the start of the publication of the second issue of the British Theatre by John Bell (1745-1831). Each issue consisted of a play with a vignette and full length portrait of a leading actor of the day as one of the characters from the play. By the end of the eighteenth century de Wilde's career was established as a theatrical portraitist.",
