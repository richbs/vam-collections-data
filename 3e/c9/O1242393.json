It shows the Principal Girl, Miss Marie George (1879-1955) rehearsing for the Drury Lane Pantomime in 1903. The sketch was drawn by the artist Dudley Cleaver and is signed with his initials in the bottom right hand corner. \n\nBy the end of the Victorian era the pantomime had become extremely popular and established a strong association with children and Christmas. Drury Lane was famous for its lavish Christmas pantomimes with their elaborate sets and costumes. Arthur Collins (1863-1932), who also appears in the rear of this sketch, took over the management of the theatre in 1895. Collins worked at the Drury Lane Theatre for over 43 year, progressing from actor to stage manager and from 1895, manager of the entire theatre. He remained in post throughout the first decades of the twentieth century and is credited with the introduction of an interval to these long and spectacular productions. \n\nThis item is one of several theatrical drawings from a collection of sketches commissioned from contemporary artists to be printed in illustrated magazines. The collection was donated to the museum by Sir William James Ingram in 1914.",
