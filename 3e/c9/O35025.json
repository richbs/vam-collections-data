He became a highly skilled ceramicist working in potteries at Choisy-le-Roi and Bourg-la-Reine and then for the Limoges manufacturers, the Haviland brothers, at a new workshop in Auteuil. In 1881 Haviland provided him with a studio at rue Blomet, Vaugirard, Paris.  There he developed high temperature glazes on porcelain, and on stoneware while working with AL Dammouse (1848-1926) and other collaborators. In 1886 he bought the workshop and concentrated on these glazes, as an independent potter, keeping his glazes recipes and firing temperatures a closely-guarded secret.  He was regarded by his contemporaries as the consummate ceramicist. Chaplet sold the workshop to Auguste Delaherche in 1887 and moved back to Choisy-le-Roi where he specialised in porcelain.",
