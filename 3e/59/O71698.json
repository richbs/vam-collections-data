They were made by artists, block cutters and printers working independently to the instructions of specialist publishers. Pictures of beautiful women served as guides to and souvenirs of the faces and changing hair- and dress-styles of the women who worked in the pleasure quarters of Edo (modern Tokyo). The sophistication of the block-carving and printing techniques used in this print is reflected in the depiction of the see-through fan and the translucent horn hair comb.\n\nPlaces\nThe main pleasure quarter in Edo was the Yoshiwara. It was a separate district with its own gates. It contained numerous teahouses and brothels frequented by wealthy townspeople during their leisure hours.\n\nTime\nThis print was published in Edo before commercial and diplomatic ties were established between Japan and western nations in the mid to late 1850s. During the second half of the 19th century large numbers of prints were exported to Europe and the United States. They were avidly sought out by western collectors, artists and designers, and played a major role in the development of 'Japonisme' and then art nouveau.",
