The catalogue is bound in fawn-coloured boards: the front cover carries the short title 'PICTURES IN POTTERY'  and the firm's name 'ROYAL DOULTON POTTERIES', each with decorative trefoil motifs.  The text is printed in black on cream matt paper and the photogravure illustrations on white glossy paper; the coloured frontispiece, illustrating a different version of 'Here we go gathering nuts in May' to that on p.40, is tipped in.  The first nineteen panels illustrate mainly nursery rhymes and were made for University College Hospital; the next six, for St Thomas' Hospital, show pairs of scenes from fairy tales; the next four show nursery rhymes; and the last two, made for the Children's Hospital at Paddington Green, illustrate the Nativity, and Christ as the Good Shepherd.",
