The 19th century saw a craze for ceramic figurines of performers and Agatha Walker attempted to revive this tradition with her limited edition sculptures, modelled from life in plaster and coated with a fine wax layer which was then coloured.  In 1931 Agatha Walker's wax figures were exhibited at the Fine Art Society.\n\nThis represents Marie Ney as Kate Hardcastle in Oliver Goldsmith's She Stoops To Conquer which opened at the Old Vic Theatre on 26 December 1924.  Marie Ney was born in London but made her first professional stage appearance in Australia in 1916 and in Britain in 1923 at Brixton Theatre.  In 1924 she was engaged at the Old Vic for a season of plays, playing several Shakespearean heroines including Desdemona, Ophelia and Viola.  She became one of Britain's best-known leading ladies and played a wide variety of roles on stage and in films up until the 1960s.",
