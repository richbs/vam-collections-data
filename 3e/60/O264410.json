The  decorative band (50mm wide) consists of five  figures in a row. The first is possibly a naked  man. He has red decoration at the front of  his legs which may indicate boots?  The  second figure is a woman wearing a long  robe with a blue/green stripe along her hair parting. The third is a man in a short tunic  (armour). The forth is a woman in a long  robe. She holds a club (?) in her right hand, above her head. She has a red and blue/ green stripe along her hair parting and red  decoration on her feet (shoes? - damaged) . The fifth figure is  a man holding a staff in his  right hand and a loaf of bread, at his waist,  in his left hand. He has a beard. He appears to be bare chested but wears long pants, rolled at the waist and with red outline at the front. The figures  are in purple with undyed thread forming the  details. They sit within a single lined border  on either side. The linen on which the figures  were woven was very fine although most has  been lost. The band is attached to a coarser  linen cloth at 17x22 tpc  (sys 1 x sys 2). This  thread width differs in some places. Two thick  rows run alongside the right side of the  band, created by weaving 4 or 5 linen  threads together at that point.  The piece is  stained. See 1025-1901 and 1024-1901.",
