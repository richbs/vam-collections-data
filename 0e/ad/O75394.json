It is seldom that attention is given to the borders which frame the more dramatic part of a carpet, but care also goes into their design and colouring.  Notice how the power of three broad, interlacing meanders has been softened by the addition of narrow floral stems and that the light ground inner border has been woven on a slightly smaller scale than the darker outer border.  Put these three elements together and they create a subtle and harmonious barrier around the  field. \nThere was a blue and white vase in the lower part of this fragment, but most of it is now missing.",
