After moving to London, he exhibited in several of the exhibitions organised by the Arts and Crafts Society. Gradually he evolved a more modernistic style. This design, however, had roots in 18th-century English silver.\n\nStabler taught at the Royal College of Art in London between 1912 and 1926 and undertook many official commissions. In the 1930s he acted as a design consultant to the stainless steel manufacturers Firth Vickers. During the Second World War, however, the initiative in stainless steel design passed to the Scandinavians. In 1936 the Royal Society of Arts appointed Stabler one of the first Royal Designers for Industry.",

He was a founder member of the Design and Industries Association, taught at the Royal College of Art between 1912 and 1926 and undertook many official commissions.  In the 1930s, Stabler acted as a design consultant to the stainless steel manufacturers, Firth Vickers but the initiative in this passed to the Scandinavians during the second world war.  In 1936, Stabler was appointed one of the first Royal Designers for Industry by the Royal Society of Arts.",
