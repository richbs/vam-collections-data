Deeply influenced by the stage, his unique style was also inspired by erotica, fetishism and the urban scene. All his garments, whether classical or theatrical, display the same rigour in cut and line. \n\nMugler launched his line for men in 1979, designing clothes simple in form and structure but with striking details, often using pointed angles on collars, hems, sleeves, waist and hips. This coat demonstrates both this high quality of cut and construction and also the innovative silhouette typical of Mugler's menswear, featuring angular detailing at the collar. In 2004 Mugler stopped designing both couture and ready-to-wear.",
