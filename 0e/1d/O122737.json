The edges of the top are scolloped and carved at intervals with bosses of flowers, foliage and fruit with coquillage and C scolls alternately. The top rests upon a platform supported by four turned  spindles. The cage has upper and lower boards into which four pillares are tenoned square into place. The catch is a replacment as is the tongue. There are plugs over screws on two of the struts and evidence of repair. the top tilts upwards and, when in use, is secured by a spring in a case of brass. The baluster shaft rests on a tripod stand with claw-and-ball feet. Shaft and tripod are profusely decorated with acanthus, and a pattern of floral scrolls carved in low relief in the solid. The feet are fitted with casters with laminated leather rollers. The legs are tenoned, reinforced by an iron plate nailed into place.",
