The sight edge moulding of bay leaf, lotus (acanthus and tongue), bead and reel. The wide border consists of corner bay(?) trees, and dense scrolling foliage with interweaving serpents, centred at the top and bottom with a grotesque mask with affronted lion passant supporters, and on each side with an eagle (wings outstretched) atop a grotesque mask, flanked by two smaller eagles pecking at bunches of grapes. The outer edge of rolling leaf and lotus (acanthus and tongue).\n\nFinish:\nGood quality original water gilding, mainly burnished over orange-brown bole on white ground of varying thickness. The background behind the carving is painted green-blue (the colour probably slightly more blue (less green) originally). \n\nModifications\nNumerous losses to carved foliage and faces missing from three lions. Some repairs where carved elements have glued back poorly aligned with excess glue. Wood boring beetle larvae damage.",

They were used to protect and enhance both secular and religious paintings. \n\nAs well as many picture frames acquired with paintings, the V&A acquired some frames - principally Italian renaissance in origin or style - as independent objects. They were usually chosen for the fine quality of their carving and decorative effects, and many are gilded using various techniques. Many of the ornaments used are classical and architectural in origin.",
