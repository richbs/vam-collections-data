It may have been made in the Moscow Armoury workshops which supplied the Tsar's court, using handles cast from Hamburg silver bowls of around 1650. Silver from the Baltic ports was admired and imported into Russia but the nielloed background, the use of colourful enamel and the addition of the Turkish coin (though it appears this was added later) show the Russian taste for Eastern ornament. The cover is set with cameos of bloodstone, onyx and other materials.",
