His right hand was deformed and he painted with his left. About 1821 studied landscape watercolour painting with Chevalier de la Barri\u00e8re, and also lithography, making illustrations for 'Vues Pittoresques de la Belgique'. Came to London 1823, entered into partnership with William Day, making lithographic illustrations for several volumes, notably David Roberts's 'The Holy Land ... '(1842-9), and his own 'Portfolio of Sketches in Belgium and Germany' (1840-50). Published 'Travels Through Sicily' (1827). In Paris with David Roberts 1854. As a painter in watercolours, exhibited 217 works at the New Society of Painters in Watercolours 1835-84, (Member 1835, President 1873-84); his subjects were historical (sometimes scenes from the lives of the old masters) and architectural interiors, usually Flemish and medieval. His first success was 'The Council of War in the Hall of Court ray' (1839, Tate Gallery). His first oil painting was 'The Choir of Santa Maria Novella, Florence', exhibited at the BI 1856; he showed seven others there up to 1860, mostly church interiors. Died Stockwell, London, 9 March 1885. His wife exhibited at the RA 1880; his brother Charles was a lithographer. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i> 1859, pp13-15; <i>Athenaeum</i>14 March 1885, pp352-3 \n(obit); <i>Illustrated London News</i> 28 March 1885, p327 (obit with engr portrait) \n\n<b>Interior of St Peter's, Rome</b> \n631-1901 Neg S641 \nCanvas, 140.2 x 116.8 cm (55\u00bc x 46 ins) \nSigned 'Louis Haghe' bl \nGiven by Sir Edwin Durning-Lawrence Bt 1901 \n\nThe painting is unfinished. \n\nThere are 13 gouaches of St Peter's by Haghe in the V &A collections, dated between 1863 and 1875.
