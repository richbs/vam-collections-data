Pieced: a section has been added down the left hand side. The effect of the added section is to widen the upper part of the panel. There is a narrow added section of cotton down part of the right hand side. These seams are clearly visible on the back. The edges have been folded under and stitched in place.\nThere is a border along the bottom and part way up the sides: a pointed pink flower alternates with a group of three purple buds.\n\nThe main pattern is a series of black diagonal lines from lower right to upper left.\nThere are three sizes of stripes:\n[1] very narrow - a small flower with 3 pink petals and a small flower with 3 yellow petals.\n[2] wider - a little indistinct; a blue pansy-like flower between two groups of 3 white flowers with a large pink flower, another group of 3 white flowers and smaller pink and mauve flowers.\n[3] much wider stripe - a long striped vertical stem with 3 large pink flowers next to a curving striped stem with a central pink flower and 5 white flowers.\nThreads: Silk, 2S: black, white, dark blue, blue, red, pink, green, yellow, beige.",
