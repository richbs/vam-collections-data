Flat-backs were simple and cheap to produce, needing only three moulds for a back, a front and a base.  Flat-backs were produced in vast quantities in the Staffordshire villages of Stoke, Fenton, Longton, Tunstall, Burslem, Hanley and Shelton.\n\n The inspiration for this figure group is taken from Robert Burns's poem Auld Lang Syne.  This was a traditional Scottish song sung for many years before the birth of Burns (1759-1796), but Burns kept the name and changed both the words and the melody.  Burns wrote five verses but the first verse and the chorus are traditionally sung in Scotland and other countries around the world to celebrate the passing of the old year and the beginning of the new. Various examples of this figure group were produced, all featuring three characters; some have a bottle on the table, and some like this have the central figure holding a jug or tankard.",

There are five verses but the first verse and chorus are the ones known today:\n\nShould auld acquaintance be forgot\n   And never brought to min'?\nShould auld aquaintance be forgot\n    And days of auld lang syne?\n\nCHORUS\nFor auld lang syne, nmy dear\n   For auld lang syne\nWe'll tak' a cup o'kindness yet\n  For auld land syne.\n\nRobert Burns sent a copy of the original song to the British Museum with this comment: 'The following song, an old song, of the olden times, and which has never been in print, nor even in manuscript until I took it down from an old man's singing , is enough to recommend any air.'",
