By Messrs Edwards And Darly. Published according to Act of Parliament, & Sold by the</i><i> Authors, the first House on the right hand in Northumberland Court, in the Strand, & by the Print & Booksellers in Town & Country. MDCCLIV.</i> Full bound in leather, gold tooled, lettered on the spine <i>Chinese Designs</i>.\n\nLettered on the title-page with title etc. and J. Champion Scr. Edwards &amp; Darly sculp. With index to plates. Lettered on the plates <i>Edwards &amp; Darly Invt. Sculp According to Act 1754</i> etc.\n\nEngravings. Size of volume 27.8 x 22.5 cm\nE.6502-6617--1905\n\nThe book is open at Plate 22 which is likely to have formed the basis for the similar group of a man and two children in the 'Pagoda' cotton (cat. no. 1.7.c).\n\nMatthew Darly was a manufacturer of paper-hangings, an engraver and designer, who engraved many of the plates in Chippendale's <i>Director</i>, and also published ornamental borders for 'print rooms'. In 1754, the same year as the publication of <i>A new book of Chinese designs</i>, he drew and engraved microscopic slide magnifications, which appeared as a plate in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> (see cat. no. 1.11.a). He was in addition a well known caricaturist. He specialised in paper-hangings in the 'chinese taste'. This volume, and other works including J.A. Fraisse's <i>Le livre de dessins Chinoises</i>... (1735), Sir William Chambers' <i>Designs for Chinese buildings, furniture, dresses, etc</i> (1757), and Paul Decker's <i>Chinese architecture civil and ornamental</i> (1759) were among the sources of pattern in the oriental style widely adapted to architecture, furniture, textiles and wallpaper during the 18th century.'",
