He turned a natural tendency to stammer into a part of his act, continuously interrupting his routine to talk to or tell off his audience. The key to his success was in making what was a well rehearsed performance appear to be spontaneous. He is perhaps best remembered for his television role as Lurcio, a Roman slave, in the comedy, Up Pompeii. Billie Anthony was a singer in the 1950s, the early days of 'pop' music. She released 22 singles, but only managed a chart hit with one of them. However her version of 'This Ole House' by Stuart Hamblen impressed the composer so much that he wrote 'Shake the Hand of a Stranger' especially for her.",
