Sherington (or Sharington) was born in 1495 and died in 1553. He bought Lacock Abbey in 1540 and the tiles should therefore be dated soon after that year.\n\nNote in Register: The Rev. E.V. Tanner, formerly Vicar of Preston, stated that in 1855 when the font in the church was moved a number of medieval tiles were found in the floor beneath it and removed to the vicarage garden, where they were set with plain modern tiles in a small pavement in front of the summer house. He has recently (1961) rediscovered this pavement, which includes one complete tile with a griffin (arms of De Redvers) and triangular tiles with a dove [?] resembling that on a triangular tile in the V&A from Muchelney Abbey, Somerset. But no more 'WS' tiles.",
