            "public_access_description": "The top of this ivory figure has a tenon (a projecting piece). This suggests that it originally acted as some sort of support, possibly as one of a group of throne legs.  The bulging eyes, flame-like mane, fangs and distinctive rearing pose are all typical of interpretations of the yali (or vyala) at that time. The yali was a mythical beast with a lion-like head. It sometimes also had an elephant's trunk and tusks, and leaves coming from its mouth.  \nThis small figure is modelled on the sculptural yali pillars that featured in South Indian temple architecture.  Pillars carved with rearing animals of this type first appeared in the architecture of the Vijayanagara empire. They feature in temple complexes commissioned under the Tuluva dynasty in the 16th century, often in  mandapas (a porch or pillared hall).  Mandapas at the Virupaksha shrine, Hampi (1510), the Chintala Venkataramana temple, Tadpatri (16th century) and the Vidyashankara temple, Sringeri (16th century), all have pillars carved as rearing yali. Such columns became standard features in the extensive mandapas and monumental processional corridors erected by the Nayak governors of Gingee, Madurai and Tanjore. The governors were installed by the Tuluva dynasty. They proclaimed sovereignty from their overlords as the Vijayanagara empire disintegrated in 1565. It is very likely that this yali figure was made under Nayak patronage in the 17th and 18th centuries. During this period, carvers and sculptors made much use of the yali in their work. It was also during this period that places such as Madurai, Mysore and Tiruchirapalli became centres of ivory carving.",
