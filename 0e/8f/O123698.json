In 1708 a method of producing porcelain was discovered in Germany and, under noble patronage, a porcelain factory was established at Meissen, near Dresden. The Meissen factory specialised in producing high quality tableware. In particular, they made pieces associated with the \u2018exotic\u2019 new food and drink stuffs entering Europe from Asia, the Americas and West Indies, which increasingly graced the tables of fashionable and wealthy homes.\n\nMany Meissen pieces reflect the period\u2019s interest in the \u2018exotic\u2019 and decorations based on those seen on Chinese ceramics were especially popular. This piece was probably intended for serving broth in the owner's private apartment (in part as similar examples are equipped, like ecuelles, with matching stands, and as similar pieces have been identified with entries in Dresden palace inventory records of 1721 for 'Soup pots on three lion feet with handles, the covers bearing round pointed knobs'). The basin and saucer are decorated with scenes of Chinese-inspired figures. One scene, curiously, appears to show a black slave kneeling before two such figures.",
