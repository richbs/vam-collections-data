By the late 18th century the sampler was much less likely to be an exemplar of all the stitches its maker would find useful. While still an exercise in skill, it had become equally noted for its moral and pictorial content. This example is relatively early and instead of the more usual pictures and text it is an exercise in different darning techniques.",
