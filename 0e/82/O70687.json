            "physical_description": "Writing cabinet, apparently in three sections (actually two), veneered in walnut, with marquetry of turtle shell, horn, brass, pewter, ivory and various woods, on a carcase of pine, the drawers lined with embossed gilded paper; mounts of lacquered brass. The cabinet takes the form of an English bureau with an integral cupboard above. The cabinet is inlaid with the date 1716 in pewter on the frieze and inside the writing flap is inlaid the cyper of Jacob Gallus von Hohlach (1665-1724), whose arms appear in the marquetry of the upper doors. \n\n<u>Design</u>\nThe cabinet appears to be in three sections, with a sloping, flap-fronted writing compartment between upper and lower cupboards, each accessed by two doors, although the two lower sections are built as one.The lower cupboard is buttressed on each side by a pair of stepped, S-scrolled consoles which support the outer drawers on each side, just below the writing compartment. This compartment is in three sections, with smaller flaps on the sides as well as the front.  The cupboard doors of the upper tier are flanked by a bank of four drawers on either side, the topmost drawers stepping inwards with scrolling consoles at the outer ends. A frieze of two drawers forms a cresting to the cupboard.\n\nThe surface is decorated all over with marquetry of burr walnut, with sycamore, boxwood, tulipwood ebonized and stained woods, and with pewter, brass, turtle shell, horn and ivory.  On the inside of the main flap the marquetry of the cypher is laid into a ground of snakewood. The drawers are lined with two patterns of embossed, coloured and gilded paper. The cupboards and the side writing compartments are lined with red watered silk, in the side compartments showing the embossed paper surviving underneath.\n\n<u>Lower Section</u>\nThe lower section is raised on a shaped plinth, veneered in walnut and set with ebonized mouldings top and bottom. The centre of this plinth is recessed, below the two doors of shaped section, which open to reveal a cupboard with a single shelf and a full-width drawer at the top. Framing panels to either side of the cupboard doors follow a quadrant plan, leading to the side panels agains which are set the double console brackets at each side.  The quadrant panels rise only three-quarters of the height of the cupboard doors. Above them, the remaining height of the doors is occupied by a drawer with a shaped front on each side, running over the double balusters. The top edge of the lower cupboard section is moulded and ebonized. \n\nThe panels on the doors, the quadrant panels, the shaped drawers and shaped panels at the drawer height on the sides, are outlined with bands of ebonized wood set with continuous bands of ornament in light-coloured sycamore (upright anthemion and formal foliage), suggesting similar banding on boulle marquetry.  The grounds of all the panels except the doors are veneered with burr walnut, inlaid with naturalistic flowers.  The doors are inlaid with interior scenes (mirrored on the two panels), suggesting a theatre set with a single door, a tiled floor of alternate dark and light tiles, all enclosed in a strapwork border, from which hangs a striped rope on which sits a parrot and from which hangs a bunch of flowers.  An additional element is fixed to the front of the right-hand door, to cover the joining of the doors. The front face of this is set with dark/light marquetry of a repeating design. The panels on the sides of the cabinet are veneered with burr walnut, the edges cross-banded outside an octagonal framing in ebonized wood, the walnut in the centre book-matched. The drawers and doors are set with small, shaped lockplates in lacquered brass.  \n\nFour carved consoles, two at either side, are set under the drawer level of the lower section.  These are not veneered but are grained to imitate walnut, the sides ebonized and the centre of each outer face ebonized and stencilled with hanging husks in gilding. Two of the consoles appear to be replacements and these show notched carving on one side each. \n\nThe central cupboard is set with a single drawer at the top, running the full width.  This has a front shaped in section, veneered in burr walnut and cross-banded in tulipwood with stringing in a red hardwood, and and outer framing of ebonized wood. The main panel of walnut shows a highly visible join or serpentine form. \n\n<u>Writing compartment</u>\nThe upper part of the lower tier is composed of three writing compartments, the two side ones set at right angles to the main compartment. The hinged flaps of these, and the stepped panels at the front corners, are outlined with versions of the repeating patterns in light and ebonized wood, surrounding grounds of burr walnut. On the flaps only these bandings surround panels of burr walnut, outlined with tulipwood cross-banding, and set wtih floral marquetry in naturalistically stained woods (now faded), including tulips, roses and rosebuds and carnations, and with parrots and insects and butterflies, the antennae of these in pewter. The ledges in front of the side flaps show flowers and butterflies, also with antennae in pewter.  The two side compartments were originally lined with stamped, printed paper, now covered with watered red silk over panels of cardboard. There were probably intended for the use of secretaries.  Each is set with a steel lock with double bolts, spring locks with a single throw. \n\nThe main compartment is highly decorated within, for the use of the owner but shows no writing surface. The flap and the base panel just behind it are each trapezoidal in shape and mirror each other in design, providing a frame for the owner's cypher, set in engraved pewter in a ground of snakewood set with the grain running front to back, within bands of ornament in light and ebonized wood showing three-lobed motifs taken from boulle marquetry, in two patterns and edged with cross-banding in tulipwood and stringing in light and dark woods. The cypher, with calligraphic flourishes at either end on each line, is composed of addorsed pairs of letters forming monograms, together reading:\n                                                                                     J E A L U S\n                                                                                      J A C O B\nfor Gallus Jacob.  The area beneath the upper cupboard is set with a single wide recess, flanked at either side by two drawers. The recess, the drawer fronts and the triangular cheeks of the writing compartment are veneered in burr walnut (two panels in the recess), cross-banded with tulipwood and with two colour stringing. The sides and framing of the nest are cross-banded in tulipwood. The drawer fronts are set with small, plain-turned knobs in brass. The drawers are lined with stamped gilded paper.\n\nIf you remove the lower right drawer the floor of the compartment in the front section can be removed as a single block of pine, revealing a recess under the back half of the floor. It is assumed that this is where the letter was found. A similar arrangement is visible under the lower left drawer but, although it is clear that strenuous efforts had been made to lift it before the cabinet came to the Museum, it has not proved possible to remove it safely. \n\n<u>Upper Section</u>\nThe upper section shows two cupboard doors flanked by a bank of three drawers on each side, with similar dark/light framing bands of marquetry, cross-banding and floral marquetry set against burr walnut. Above these, on each side, is a smaller drawer with similar decoration, buttressed by a rounded section veneered with an inlaid scroll in ebonized wood and crested by a shaped panel inlaid in pewter with the date, '17' on the left (PR) panel and '16' on the right (PL) panel. Above this a deep, ebonized moulding forms a cornice, above which is set a shallow attic section, of serpentine outline, set with a single drawer, its front veneered as two panels with a design showing a balustraded gallery, beyond which a wooden-framed back wall and a beamed ceiling are visible, as if viewed from below. The drawers of the upper section are each set with brass drop handles in the form of acorns and oak leaves, against a six-point star backplate. \n\nThe marquetry on each main door shows, within formal dark/light marquetry bandings, a ground of burr walnut, set with a central ebony-veneered panel. A lower shaped compartment on each is set with marquetry of flowers in a vase, the marquetry with highlights in ivory. The upper compartment on each door is set with an armorial panel beneath an upholstered canopy seen in light wood, with drapery running down behind the arms. On the left side are the arms of von Hohlach: 'Per fess, in chief azure an escallop argent, and in base azure three bendelets or [a divided blue shield with a scallop shell above, and below three gold bars]', under the crest 'An escallop between a pair of wings joined in vol azure, each charged with a mullet or' [a scallop shell between a pair of splayed wings in blue, each set with a gold star] , against a mantling 'argent and azure' [an upper drapery in silver and blue]. These are the arms that were granted to von Hohlach in 1717. On the right side the same cresting and mantling provides a frame for the mirror monogram 'GJ' beneath a coronet. \n\nThe sides of the upper section are each set with three vertical panels showing floral marquetry against a ground of burr walnut, outlined with bands of repeating ornament in dark and light woods. Above, the side of console scrolls are veneered in burr walnut, outlined with ebonized bandings.  The stepped panels of the attic section at each side are similarly veneered, with a central long panel on each side showing a continuation of the balustrade of the front, with parrots perched on its. \n\nInside the central door, the cupboard is set with a central recess lined with red watered silk.  it is set with two pairs of shelf supports and a single shelf, all covered in the same red silk. The cupboard is flanked by a bank of five drawers on each side, with a single, wider drawer below the central recess. The drawer fronts are veneered in burr walnut, cross-banded with walnut, with an outer frame of ebonized wood. The brass drawer handles are of the same pattern as on the external drawers. The front of the drawer framing is set with cross-banded walnut. \n\n\n\n\n[Letter] A letter written in ink on rag paper.\n  \nTranslation of letter, which describes conditions in Wurzburg in the year of its making:\n\n\"This cabinet was made by Jacob Arend of Koblenz and Johannes Witthalm of Vienna, who are at present journeyman cabinet-makers in the service of Master Servacius Arend, court cabinet-maker in W\u00fcrzburg.  It was made in the year 1716, when cabbage and peas were often the best food we could obtain. As a result we have grown so fat that we can hardly climb the stairs any more, but meat has been in very short supply for us, God pity us.  There was seldom warm bread in our kitchen, but the wine has always tasted good; when we have earned one week's wages, two have already been drunk, for wine has become dear this year with the vintage having been poor these last four years.  This year there has also been a great war in Hungary against the Turks.\"\n\nOn the back of the above is written:\n\"I, Jacob Arend, invented this cabinet in my own mind and have drafted it all and marked it out.  I havecut it [the marquetry] with a fret-saw and shaded it.  This was done in the Sander quarter, near the Korn Gasse by the river Main.  But neither of us will be staying here much longer.  This cabinet has been completed in the winter month [s], and we would like to go elsewhere, for little meat and a great deal of cabbage and turnips have driven us out of W\u00fcrzburg.  We ask him who finds this note to drink to our health and if we are no longer living then, may God grant us eternal rest and salvation.  This 22nd day of October in the year 1716\".  \n\nIslamic forces had been defeated by troops under the leadership of Prince Eugene of Savoy (1663-1736) at the Battle of Peterwardein, 5 August 1716 and the letter presumably refers to this campaign.",

They implied that their owner was both wealthy and educated, a person who needed a special place to house his papers and personal treasures. In W\u00fcrzburg in Germany, a cabinet of this kind was called a Trisur, a term relating to 'treasure'. In the southern German states they were often decorated with boulle marquetry, which uses both woods and metals in its veneers. On this cabinet, a simplified version of the boulle technique is used to create the owner's arms on the main doors, standing out against the more traditionsl wooden marquetry which shows flowers and scenes of interiors. This cabinet is additionally interesting because the craftsmen who made it left a letter hidden inside, which gives a vivid description of the hard times 'when cabbage and corn were often the best food we could get hold of'. Such records of the personal life of craftsmen are very rare indeed.",

            "history_note": "Made in the workshop of Servatius Arend (1673-1729), court cabinet-maker at W\u00fcrzburg, the work undertaken by the journeymen Jacob Arend of Koblenz and Johannes Witthalm of Vienna in 1716.  They left a letter describing conditions in W\u00fcrzburg in 1716 hidden inside the desk (W.23:41-1975)\n\nIt was made for Johannes Gallus Jacob (1670-1736 or 1737), whose cypher and arms are incorporated into the marquetry. He was the all-powerful finance minister (<i>Hofkammerdirektor</i>) of the Prince Bishop of W\u00fcrzburg Johann Philipp von Greiffenclau (1699-1719) and made a fortune by supplying war materials. Gallus Jacob was born at Tauberbischofsheim, the son of a rope-maker. In 1698 he came to W\u00fcrzburg and there became Groom of the Chamber at the Prince Bishop's court, rising to the rank of Chancellor. He married a daughter of the respected Franconian court official named Ganzhorn. By 1709 he had become leader of the Cabinet, Privy Councillor and Holder of the Privy Purse. In 1712, during a visit of the Emperor Charles VI to W\u00fcrzburg, he was raised to the rank of Imperial Privy Councillor. The Emperor was particularly well-disposed towards Gallus Jacob who had arranged for W\u00fcrzburg troops to serve with the imperial forces, first in the War of the Spanish Succession and then in the Turkish War, under Prince Eugene.  The Emperor paid a rent for the troops, and also a payment to Gallus Jacob himself, who also benefited from outfitting the troops and manufacturing armaments. \n\nHe was knighted by the Emperior in 1717 (the warrant issued 26 June 1717) and took the title 'von Hohlach' (Gallus Jacob von Hohlach). He lived in an exceptionally luxurious manner in W\u00fcrzburg. Greiffenclau's successor, Johann Philipp Franz von Sch\u00f6nborn (1673-1724, Prince Bishop from 1719), however, had him arrested immediately after his own accession and only released him after he had paid out a heavy fine, which later served to support the building of the surviving Residenz in W\u00fcrzburg. Gallus Jacob died in 1736 or 1737.\n\nThe cabinet was probably made either for his house the Hof Friedberg in the Bronnbachergasse in W\u00fcrzburg or in his country house at Schlosse Walkershofen, to the south of W\u00fcrzburg.  A portrait of Gallus Jacob by the Prague-born artist  Franz Mika, is in the Mainfr\u00e4nkisches Museum, W\u00fcrzburg. Mika died in Wurzburg in 1749.\n\nThe family of Gallus Jacob appears to have died out in the 19th century.  A descendant named Abraham died in 1829. He had only three daughters.  Another grandson, born in 1791, was still living in Wurzburg in 1825 but was unmarried and apparently had no children (information from Prof. Dr von Freeden in a letter to Peter Thornton 15 January 1969). When W\u00fcrzburg became part of the Bavaria in 1803-1805 much furniture from the Residenz was said to have been sold to England.  If Gallus Jacob had an apartment in the Residenz, might this cabinet have been there, and sold to England at that time?\n\nTranslation of letter found inside, which describes conditions in Wurzburg in the year of its making:\n\"This cabinet was made by Jacob Arend of Koblenz and Johannes Witthalm of Vienna, who are at present journeyman cabinet-makers in the service of Master Servacius Arend, court cabinet-maker in W\u00fcrzburg.  It was made in the year 1716, when cabbage and peas were often the best food we could obtain. As a result we have grown so fat that we can hardly climb the stairs any more, but meat has been in very short supply for us, God pity us.  There was seldom warm bread in our kitchen, but the wine has always tasted good; when we have earned one week's wages, two have already been drunk, for wine has become dear this year with the vintage having been poor these last four years.  This year there has also been a great war in Hungary against the Turks.\"\n\nOn the back of the above is written:\n\"I, Jacob Arend, invented this cabinet in my own mind and have drafted it all and marked it out.  I havecut it [the marquetry] with a fret-saw and shaded it.  This was done in the Sander quarter, near the Korn Gasse by the river Main.  But neither of us will be staying here much longer.  This cabinet has been completed in the winter month [s], and we would like to go elsewhere, for little meat and a great deal of cabbage and turnips have driven us out of W\u00fcrzburg.  We ask him who finds this note to drink to our health and if we are no longer living then, may God grant us eternal rest and salvation.  This 22nd day of October in the year 1716\".  \n\nIslamic forces had been defeated by troops under the leadership of Prince Eugene of Savoy (1663-1736) at the Battle of Peterwardein, 5 August 1716 and the letter presumably refers to this campaign.\n\nPurchased in England on 31 August 1843 by John Gibbons for \u00a3160. Its history before this is unknown (information from family members). It may have been at the time of the 1843 sale that the date was transposed to read '1617' (this was corrected in 1975).  It was probably also at this time that two of the consoles were replaced (possibly early ones had been lost) and the cupboards lined with watered silk. An old paper held by the family (a photocopy of which is in Museum files) recorded 'Prince Maurice of Nassau had it made for a man named Galv\u00e9 who had furnished the prince with monies for his wars - Galv\u00e9, who was enobled by the prince, had gold mines in Spain'.  Prince Maurice lived 1567-1625 and it possible that it was to support this claim that the dates was transposed. The writing on the paper probably dates from the time of the purchase of the cabinet by the Gibbons family. \n\nJohn Gibbons and his wife Elizabeth lived in a number of houses in the area around Dudley in Worcestershire (now West Midlands). He made a fortune in the iron trade.  In 1845 he moved to 17, Hanover Terrace, Regents Park, London, where he died in 1851. The cabinet is shown in the background of a painting of two young women (unidentified, but probably from the Gibbons family), by C.R. Leslie, 1846. The painting is entitled 'The Shell' and was commissioned by John Gibbons. it is assumed that this was painted at Hanover Terrace.\n\nOn boxing day in 1967 two young boys of the family (Michael Boughey, nephew of Mrs Gibbons and her son Benjamin) were searching for secret drawers in the cabinet and asked to remove some elements that had been glued in place (the front of the base under the lower ). There they discovered the letter written in 1716.\n\nOn loan to the V&amp;A from Mrs Gibbons from 1968 (RF: Nominal File MA/1/G500).  \n\nSold by Mrs E. Gibbons to the V&amp;A, 1977 (Registered File 68/3387)",
