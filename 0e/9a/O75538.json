Brangwyn's 1914 design for a recruitment poster - Britain's Call To Arms - was judged too horrific by the War Office. However, the War Office dropped their demand to have the poster withdrawn when it became clear that Britain's Call To Arms drew recruits in huge numbers.\n \nIn this impression the faint markings below the falling helmet reveal the texture of the transfer paper on which the design was originally drawn. This enabled the image, reversed when transferred to the lithographic stone, to be drawn as it would appear when printed. However, use of transfer paper was unusual for Brangwyn, who usually drew directly on the stone.",
