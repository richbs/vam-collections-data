He trained with his father, Hubert Drouais (1699-1767) and then with Donat Nonotte (1708-1785), Carle van Loo (1705-1765), Charles-Joseph Natoire (1700-1777) and Fran\u00e7ois Boucher (1703-1770). He became a member of the Acad\u00e9mie Royale in 1755 and achieved quickly a great success as a portrait painter, receiving prestigious commissions, especially from the court.\n\nThis painting depicts a young lady  whose costume is datable ca. 1760. She is identified by an inscription on the parapet reading \u2018Mlle Dor\u00e9\u2019, which could refer to either the future wife of the painter, Anne-Fran\u00e7oise Dor\u00e9 or her sister, Marie-Jeanne. This painting is a good example of Drouais\u2019 production of portraits, a category in which he specialised with success.",

Before 1800</u>, London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, p. 87, cat. no. 87\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"Mademoiselle DOR\u00c9 (active c. 1760-70) \n<i>French school</i>  \nProbably to be identified with Marie- Jeanne Dor\u00e9 (b. 1736), the sister-in-law of Fran\u00e7ois-Hubert Drouais (1727-75), see below. \n\n87 \nAN UNKNOWN GIRL HOLDING A ROSE IN HER RIGHT HAND \nInscribed on parapet <i>Melle Dor\u00e9</i>  \n<i>Canvas, oval </i> \n27 x 24 (68.6 x 61)\nJones Bequest \n600-1882 \n \nThe close affinity with Drouais' style led to the original attribution to this artist, which was accepted by C. Gabillot in 1905. This attribution was supported by Drouais' relationship by marriage to the Dor\u00e9 family. On 26 July 1758 he married Anne-Fran\u00e7oise Dor\u00e9 (1732-1809), the eldest of three daughters of Pierre Dor\u00e9 (d. 1751), a locksmith, and his wife Fran\u00e7oise Breche de la Bont\u00e9. Of Anne-Fran\u00e7oise's two sisters, Marie-Jeanne was 22 in 1758, and Marie was 12. Marie-Jeanne went to live with the Drouais after their marriage and helped to bring up their children. Gabillot suggested that the sitter was Marie-Jeanne, but Long inclined to the view that the painting depicted Anne-Fran\u00e7oise before her marriage, on the grounds of similarity with Drouais' other portraits of his wife (see especially <i>Gazette des Beaux-Arts,</i>xxxiv, 1905, p. 391, repr.) \nHowever, Long admitted that both the attribution to Drouais and the identification of the sitter were inconclusive, and he suggested that the inscription might possibly be a signature. Subsequently, this hypothesis was strengthened by the appearance of two portraits, in a very similar style, both signed <i>Mlle Dor\u00e9:</i>  \n(1) An unknown man; sale Drouot, Paris, 20-1 Dec. 1937, lot 4 (repr. in catalogue), dated 1763. \n(2) An unknown woman; sale Fischer, Lucerne, 21-3 Aug. 1930, lot 288 (repr. in catalogue), dated 1765. \nTo judge from the reproductions, these appear to be by the same hand as 600-1882, and it seems likely that this artist is identical with the Mademoiselle Dor\u00e9 who exhibited miniatures in oil at the Exposition de la Jeunesse, Place Dauphine, Paris in 1769. As 600-1882 may be dated c. 1765 from the costume and as the other two paintings are dated 1763 and 1765 respectively, it seems likely that Mademoiselle Dor\u00e9 can be identified with Drouais' sister-in-law, Marie-Jeanne. It is most likely that Anne-Fran\u00e7oise would sign in this manner after her marriage and the youngest sister Marie (aged 17 in 1763) may be excluded on grounds of age. The fact that Marie-Jeanne was staying with the Drouais for some years after 1758 would help to account for the close dependence of her style on that of her famous brother-in-law. This link is stressed in the Drouot sale catalogue (20 Dec. 1937, lot 288). \n\n<i>Prov.</i>John Jones; bequeathed to the Museum in 1882. \n<i>Lit.</i>J. J.

This attribution is supported by M. Alastair Laing (written communication, Jan 2008).\n\nThe two copies, one in the Government Art Collection, London, and another sold at Sotheby's London, 1st Nov. 2007, lot 193, are moreover both attributed to Drouais. The inscription on the parapet reading 'Mlle Dor\u00e9' seems therefore to allude to the identity of the sitter rather than that of the artist. \n \nThe sitter could in fact be identified with either the wife of the artist before their marriage (hence the inscription 'Mlle' which stands in French for 'Miss') or her sister, who came to live with the family after the wedding. \n\nIt is most likely however that the V&amp;A painting portrayed the wife of the artist as the sitter is very similar to a portrait of Madame Drouais, wife of the artist, dated ca. 1758 (Louvre, Paris). In the same guise as in our painting, she has some wild roses pressed against her heart and wears a similar blue dress with a large blue knot under her chin.\nCarnation and wild roses were often used as a symbol of bethrotal and love. This attribute would therefore illustrate appropriately the bond between the painter and his wife.\n\nBased on the style of the dress, similar to the one in the Louvre portrait, this painting can be reasonably dated c. 1760.\n\nDrouais was a successful portrait painter and was entrusted with a series of royal commissions. This portrait is a fine example of his art, which combines mastery and freshness.",
