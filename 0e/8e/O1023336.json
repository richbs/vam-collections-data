Eleven proofs on India paper from the original copper plates, wood blocks, and lithographic stones. Published by Messrs. Carfax & Co., Ltd., 1904. (The original lettered inscription on the wood blocks have been removed.) The issue was limited to thirty copies. The two copper engravings and seven wood-engravings were printed from the original plates and blocks, now in the British Museum. Of the two lithographs, the impressions included in this issue were part of a remainder, numbering only thirty-five, of those printed under the artist's own supervision in 1829. (After printing, the stones were cleaned, and in the memoir by Calvert's third son, these subjects were reproduced by means of photo-process blocks.)",
