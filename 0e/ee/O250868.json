The Palazzo Spada was built by Giulio Merisi da Carvaggio c.1540. In 1635 Francesco Borromini added a garden wall and this small colonnade. It is famous for Borromini\u2019s use of a very distorted perspective, which gives the impression of great length although the structure is, in reality, very short. Chamber\u2019s accurate plan and section ruthlessly reveal the clever artifice of the construction. \n\nChambers moved to London in 1755 and published his influential Treatise on Civil Architecture in 1759.  Chambers demonstrated the breadth of his style in buildings such as Gower (later Carrington) House and Melbourne House, London, in such country houses as Duddingston, Scotland, and in the garden architecture he designed for Wilton House, Wiltshire, and at Kew Gardens. He became head of government building in 1782, and in this capacity built Somerset House, London.",

Chamber's accurate plan and section ruthlessly reveal the clever artifice of the construction. See also cat.316.\nProv.: found unregistered in Department.",
