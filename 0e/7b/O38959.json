However, the dish was made in Iznik, north-west Anatolia. By the 1530s, the small sprays of tulips and other recognisable flowers shown here were a common motif in Ottoman ceramics.\n\nIznik has given its name to some of the most accomplished ceramics produced in the Islamic Middle East. In the mid 15th century, potters there specialised in modest earthenware imitations of Chinese blue-and-white porcelain. But in the 1460s or 1470s, under the patronage of Sultan Mehmet the Conqueror, they began to manufacture bowls, dishes and other pieces of fritware that were elegant in shape and decoration. These wares were often very large.",
