This represents Anton Dolin and Alicia Markova in the Act III pas de deux of The Sleeping Beauty, executing the move known as a fish dive. This move was not in the original ballet but was introduced in the early 20th century to emphasise the virtuosity of the performers.  There is now a series of three fish dives during the introduction to the Act III pas de deux, and another at the very end.  This probably represents the final fish dive.\n\nAnton Dolin (1904-1983) and Alicia Markova (1910-2004) formed one of the greatest partnerships in the history of dance.  They were both British dancers who trained in London at Princess Serafina Astefieva's dance school in Chelsea and went on to dance with Diaghilev's Ballets Russes.  They first danced together in 1935 and went on to create the Markova-Dolin Ballet company which lasted from 1935 until 1937 and pioneered ballet throughout Britain. After the war, when Markova was a guest of the Sadler's Wells Ballet at Covent Garden, she and Dolin performed The Sleeping Beauty together for the first time, when this was sculpted. Following their success in The Sleeping Beauty they performed in many European cities and started another company which became the seed for The London Festival Ballet.",
