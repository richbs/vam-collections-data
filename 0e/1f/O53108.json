The unusual method of hanging the fabric from the back of the chair was intended to emphasise the Gothic design and to make the backs look more interesting.\n\nPlaces\nEaton Hall, Cheshire, was built in 1804-1812 for Robert, 2nd Earl Grosvenor (1767-1845) by the architect William Porden (1755-1822), with additional wings of 1823-1825. (The house was altered 1846-51, rebuilt in 1870 and demolished in 1963.) The drawing room was furnished with blue and yellow curtains and a range of furniture in different versions of the Gothic style, including two of these chairs, covered in crimson velvet and red damask.\n\nOwnership & Use\nLord Grosvenor also commissioned a simplified version of this chair for the dining room at Eaton Hall. Another set of dining chairs was ordered by Lord Berwick from the furniture makers Gillow & Co for his house, Attingham Park, Shropshire. That set, covered in blue leather and carved with vine leaves in the back, are still in the dining room at Attingham.\n\n",
