London : South Kensington Museum, 1874.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n'ENGLISH SCHOOL.\n...\nTHOMAS ROWLANDSON. \nDesigner of Humorous Subjects and Etcher.  \nBorn in London in 1756, and died there in 1827. \n...\nROWLANDSON \u2013 (<i>continued</i>) \n...\nILLUSTRATIONS TO \u201cTHE TOUR OF DR. SYNTAX IN SEARCH OF THE PICTURESQUE.\u201d\nAll in colours. \n\nDR. SYNTAX pursued by a bull.  802 \n\u201cSyntax, still trembling with affright, \nClung to the tree with all his might.' \u2013 Vol. i. p. 40. \n<i>Width,</i> 7 8/12 <i>inches.  Height, </i>4 9/12 <i>inches.</i> \n\nSYNTAX drawing from Nature.  803 \n\u201cThe Doctor now, with genius big, \nFirst drew a cow, and next a pig.\u201d - Vol. i, p. 121. \n<i>Width,</i> 7 1/12 <i>inches.  Height, </i>4 <i>inches.</i> \n\nDr. SYNTAX at a card party.  804 \n\u201cThe comely pair by whom he sat, \nA lady cheerful in her chat.\" - Vol. iii, p. 168. \n\nThe remainder of the series appear to have been designed for the work, but not etched nor used as suggestions to Mr. Combe, excepting those noted. It may not be generally known at the present time that the tours were written to elucidate the designs, which the following introduction fully explains. \n\u201cThis second tour is, like the former one, a work of suggestions from the plates by Mr. Rowlandson, though not with such entire reserve as the first. Some few of the subjects may have been influenced by hints from me; and I am willing to suppose that such are the least amusing of them.\u201d \u2013 Introduction to the second volume, 1820. \n<i>Width,</i> 8 3/12 <i>inches.  Height, </i>4 10/12 <i>inches.</i> \n\nDR. SYNTAX unable to pull up at the Land\u2019s End - is fearful of being carried to the World's End. View on the coast during a storm, with the vivid flashes of lightning frightening the people, and the heavy waves dashing on the shore.  805 \n<i>Width,</i> 10 9/12 <i>inches.  Height, </i>7 8/12 <i>inches.</i> \n\nDR. SYNTAX taking wine with a lady in a drawing room, while the daughter of his hostess and her lover exchange caresses on a rustic seat under the verandah.  806 \n<i>Width,</i> 8 5/12 <i>inches.  Height, </i>10 4/12 <i>inches.</i>\n\n\nROWLANDSON \u2013 (<i>continued</i>) \n\nDR. SYNTAX thrown off his horse while hunting.  807 \n\u201cYour sport, my lord, I cannot take, \nFor I must go and hunt a lake.\" - Vol. i. p. 108. \n\nMr. Combe no doubt thought it as well, although availing himself of the hint that hunting was not suited to the Doctor's taste, to mention the fact of the Doctor being asked to join the sport, and his declining the invitation as he was about to make some drawings on the lake. \n<i>Width,</i> 7 1/12 <i>inches.  Height, </i>8 11/12 <i>inches.</i> \n\nDR. SYNTAX leading a lady to the entrance of a grand mansion: most probably giving the idea of the Doctor escorting Lady Bounty from the garden to her mansion on their first interview. 808 \n\u201cFor while he sojourns he will be \nThe object of all courtesy.\u201d - Vol. ii. p. 217. \n<i>Width,</i> 9 4/12 <i>inches.  Height, </i>5 8/12 <i>inches.</i> \n\nDR. SYNTAX gazing at some ruins; a man and boy in attendance. One plate was probably thought sufficient to illustrate \u201cSketching the Ruins, and tumbling in the Water,\u201d through his seat giving way, the latter one being used.  809 \n\u201cBut now, alas! no more remains \nThan will reward the painters' pains.\" - Vol. i. p. 71. \n<i>Width,</i> 8 <i>inches.  Height, </i>4 10/12 <i>inches.</i> \n\nDR. SYNTAX in the Jail; a young fellow and three dogs on the left.  810 \n<i>Width,</i> 7 5/12 <i>inches.  Height, </i>4 8/12 <i>inches.</i> \n\nBOARDING A MAN-OF-WAR. A boat load of people awaiting their turn to ascend a rope ladder, on which a gentleman of the party is fixed in rather an uncomfortable position.  811\n<i>Width,</i> 8 5/12 <i>inches.  Height, </i>5 1/12 <i>inches.</i> \n\nDR. SYNTAX frightened by the appearance of a large fish having a form resembling that of a whale; his companion and some fishwives are also greatly alarmed, and a few of them lie sprawling on the ground.  812 \n<i>Width,</i> 8 2/12 <i>inches.  Height, </i>4 8/12 <i>inches.</i> \n\nDR. SYNTAX drawing the waterfall at Ambleside, while his man Patrick is eating voraciously.  813 \n\u201cBold sketches from the very scene, \nWhere, with his neighbours, he had been.\u201d - Vol. ii. p. 64. \n<i>Width,</i> 8 2/12 <i>inches.  Height, </i>5 4/12 <i>inches.</i> \n\nA LADY repulsing with the poker her guests, consisting of eight gentlemen, among whom is the doctor; her dog by her side appears to be equally pugnacious.  814 \n<i>Width,</i> 8 2/12 <i>inches.  Height, </i>5 4/12 <i>inches.</i> \n\nDR. SYNTAX riding and chatting with a lady, under an avenue of trees; a footman behind them.  815 \n<i>Width,</i> 8 11/12 <i>inches.  Height, </i>5 5/12 <i>inches.</i> \n\nDR. SYNTAX playing at cards with a young lady; an old wooden-legged officer seated near, apparently not in the best of tempers; three other young ladies seated on the sofa take much interest in the game.  816 \n<i>Width,</i> 8 1/12 <i>inches.  Height, </i>5 1/12 <i>inches.</i> \n\nDR. SYNTAX gently opens the door of a garret, and is horrified to find a woman of the pav\u00e9 reclining back in her chair dead; a dog is seen on the left playing with her wig.  817 \n<i>Width,</i> 8 2/12 <i>inches.  Height, </i>4 3/12 <i>inches.</i> \n\nDR. SYNTAX skating and saluting three ladies who stand on the bank of the frozen river.  818 \n<i>Width,</i> 8 11/12 <i>inches.  Height, </i>5 3/12 <i>inches.</i>'",

The text was written to elucidate the illustrations and William Combe explains this process in the introduction to the second volume, 1820: \n \n'This second tour is, like the former one, a work of suggestions from the plates by Mr. Rowlandson, though not with such entire reserve as the first. Some few of the subjects may have been influenced by hints from me; and I am willing to suppose that such are the least amusing of them.'\n\n<i>The Tour of Dr. Syntax in Search of the Picturesque</i> first appeared in serial form in 1809, within The Poetical Magazine, published by Rudolph Ackermann. The work was first collected into book form 'by popular demand' in 1812, and was reprinted a number of times during the following decades, becoming one of the most popular books of early 19th-century England.\n\nThis collaboration of designer, author, and publisher went on to produce a further two 'Tours'; <i>The Second Tour of Dr. Syntax in Search of Consolation</i> (1820), and <i>The Third Tour of Dr. Syntax in Search of a Wife</i> (1821).",
