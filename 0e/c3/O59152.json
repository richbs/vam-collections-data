            "public_access_description": "Alix Stone (born 1913) graduated from the Central School of Arts and Crafts in 1935.  She began her career assisting some of the best known stage designers of the period, including Motley, Michael Ayrton, Rex Whistler, John Piper, Tanya Moiseiwitsch and Leslie Hurry. As a set and costume designer she worked extensively for major British opera companies, notably for Sadler's Wells Opera (which became English National Opera in 1968).  Stone designed many productions for the company, including  Madam Butterfly (1964),  Gloriana (1966),  Manon (1974), and Richard Rodney Bennett's first full-length opera The Mines of Sulphur (1965).\n \nBennett's opera is an eerie tale set in the 18th century. Braxton, a lord, is murdered for his wealth by an army deserter, aided by an old tramp and Braxton's mistress, now the deserter's lover.  As they celebrate in their victim's decaying manor house, a mysterious troupe of actors arrive and entertain the thieves with a play, The Mines of Sulphur. The play's events mirror the crime and the actors are revealed as supernatural agents of retribution.  \n\nThe actors' leader, Sherrin, appears in the play as a Count who resembles Braxton. Alix Stone's design for the character's fur-lined dressing gown suggests the man's wealth and status while capturing the opera's sinister atmosphere. It gives the intended effect without providing too many details as these can be worked out by designer and costume maker. The fabric swatches show the desired colours and the materials that can be used.",
