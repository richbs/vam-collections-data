The linear treatment of the figure is emblematical of his vigorous style, and reminiscent of his caricatures for the satirical journal <i>Le Charivari</i>. \n\nThis drawing focuses on the sullen face of a judge. Daumier was particularly interested in the gesture symbolizing the different categories of society. He often emphasized their linear features in such famous caricatures as, for instance, his rework on King Louis-Philippe changed into a pear by Philipon, and his small grotesque busts of parliamentarians sculpted about 1832. \n\nThe figure is here shown in a very dignified, serious, and almost harsh posture which emphasizes the sense of responsibility that a judge must carry. The sketch belongs to a wider series of studies in which the same judge (elderly face, closed expression, haughty attitude, and curly hair) is portrayed. In the drawing <i>Etude de Quatre Avocats</i> (Chicago, The Art Institute of Chicago), the full-length character on the left side presents a similar face however less detailed. It also seems to be one of the primary ideas for the famous watercolour <i>Le Grand Escalier du Palais de Justice</i> (Baltimore, The Baltimore Museum of Art).  Moreover, in his painting <i>Les Deux Avocats</i> dated about 1858-62 (Lyon, Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts), the character on the left hand side is clearly the outcome of the V&A study. \n\nDaumier was a prolific draughtsman hence the difficulty to date most of his sketches. However these often turn out to be preparatory studies for compositions later engraved or painted. \nDaumier was most celebrated during his life time for his satirical and anti-monarchist illustrations rather than his paintings and drawings. This sheet is a good example of Daumier\u2019s observation of the French society and its professional categories. He did a few series of sketches focusing on different categories such as musicians, comedians, art collectors, rustic life, saltimbanques\u2026",
