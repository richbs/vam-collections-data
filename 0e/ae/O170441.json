Tourists loved to buy coral jewellery in fashionable shapes, but it was also very popular with Italian women, who valued it for its colour and amuletic qualities.  Coral branches were often left in a natural state for amulets, but beads for necklaces and crosses were always shaped.  The faceting on the arms of this cross is typical of 19th century Italian work.  \n\nWomen throughout Catholic Europe commonly wore Christian symbols, such as the cross and rosary, as jewellery.  The use of coral for this cross would have added to its protective value for its original owner.\n\nThis cross comes from Sicily, where Trapani was as important a centre as Naples for the manufacture of coral jewellery in the 19th century.  It was bought as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
