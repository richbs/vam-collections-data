Sunset appears to be based on a French location that was adapted to the landscape that Bonington saw on his visit to Italy in 1826. The tranquil mood and the feathery reflection of the trees in the water recall a similar treatment used by Turner in his scenes of the river Thames from the 1820\u2019s. Bonington probably first became aware of the work of Turner during his visit to London in 1825. \n\nThe painting came into John Sheepshanks\u2019 collection from that of George Cooke, who had himself collaborated with Turner on a number of engraving projects. It was left by Sheepshanks as part of his bequest to the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1857.",

New Haven: Yale Center for British Art, 1991, p. 146, cat. no. 47\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"47\n\nRIVER SCENE - SUNSET ca. 1825 \nOil on millboard, 10\u00be x 12\u00be in. (27.3 x 32.5 cm.) \n\n<i>Provenance</i>: Probably given by the artist in 1825 to Joseph West, from whom acquired by George Cooke in 1830; John Sheepshanks, by whom bequeathed to the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1857.\n\n<i>Exhibitions</i>: Possibly London, Cosmorama Rooms, 209 Regent Street, 1834, no. 54, as <i>View on the Seine</i>; Nottingham 1965, no. 257; Pointon, <i>Bonington</i>, no. 24.\n\nVictoria and Albert Museum (FA I) \n\nA graphite study, <i>Distant View of Dunkerque</i> (Nottingham), with a similar disposition of trees and rectilinear tower, anticipates this composition and was drawn in Francia's company either in 1824 or August 1825 (1). The later date seems more likely since the drawing style is identical to that of the graphite studies made in the vicinity of St-Omer (Bowood) immediately after Bonington's return from London. A lithograph by Paul Huet reverses the composition of a Bonington watercolor derived from this graphite sketch (2). The river in the oil, however, is far too broad to be any in this region and was obviously enlisted as a device for reflecting a sunset: The composition of this unfinished sketch is, therefore, almost certainly a recollection rather than a study from nature - a recollection perhaps of the terrain in the vicinity of St-Omer, but, more to the point, of Turner's river views or the classicizing topographical compositions of John Varley and other senior British watercolorists then exhibiting in London. As an imaginary composition, it may be the earliest of a series of landscapes of late 1825 and early 1826 in which Bonington arranged the stock motifs of a few silhouetted trees, a canal or river, and a distant tower in a variety of combinations and lighting conditions and which mayor may not be identifiable sites. \n     As argued by Marcia Pointon, this may be the picture given by the artist Joseph West to the engraver George Cooke in 1830 and subsequently sold by him to John Sheepshanks. Bonington probably disposed of this study in fall 1825, when he is known from other documentation to have given West several drawings. Somewhat surprising is that George Cooke did not own any Boningtons prior to his acquisition of this work, since in 1840 his nephew W. J. Cooke sold at Sotheby's nineteen drawings and watercolors and one oil titled \n<i>View on the Medway</i>, which was purchased by his brother-in-law Thomas Shotter Boys (see no. 164). Bonington had met the Cookes in London in 1825 through an introduction from the engraver Abraham Raimbach, who had requested of W. B. Cooke that he arrange for Bonington and Colin to visit the collections of Walter Fawkes and Sir John Leicester, two of Turner's most important patrons. Engravings by the Cookes after Bonington watercolors first appear the following autumn, and a Bonington portrait of W. J. Cooke was recorded in the 1834 Cosmorama exhibition. Of the many engravings after Turner by, or published by, the Cookes, the following were listed in Bonington's 1834 studio sale: india proofs of <i>Views in Sussex</i> (London, 1816-20); the <i>Rivers of England</i> (London, 1823-27), also with prints after Girtin; and <i>Marine Views</i> (London, 1825; see no. 48). It is likely that Bonington acquired all of these prints while in London in 1825 and at the same time examined many of the original watercolors for them. \n     It is not known when precisely West met Bonington, but he was one of an ever-widening circle of younger admirers that included Boys, William Ensom, Frederick Tayler, Jules Joyant, and Charles Gleyre, with whom Bonington developed a casual teacher-student relationship in Paris. West's studio sale in 1834 disposed of 148 lots of drawings, watercolors, and oils copied from the same old master paintings and engravings that had attracted both Bonington and Delacroix from 1825 onward (3). His original watercolor compositions, such as a <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> (National Gallery of Scotland), might easily pass for the work of Bonington and with equal skill unabashedly incorporate figures lifted from these sources (4). A watercolor thought to be a depiction by Bonington of his own living quarters is actually by West (5).\n \n(1) For Francia's study from a similar spot, see Calais, <i>Francia</i> no. 81. \n(2) Delteil, <i>Huet</i>, no. 80. \n(3) An album of 465 such copies by West, formerly in the collection of his patron Lord Northwick, was at Sotheby's 9 March 1989, lot 3.

John succeeded his father in the family firm of York and Sheepshanks in Leeds. After his retirement from business in 1827, John Sheepshanks moved to London. He made several trips to the Continent but lived relatively modestly. Apart from art, Sheepshanks was interested in gardening and was a member of both the Royal Horticultural Society and the Athenaeum Club. Sheepshanks liked to pursue his interest in art by entertaining painters and engravers at informal Wednesday \u201cat homes\u201d. \n\nSheepshanks began his interest in art through collecting books of Dutch and Flemish prints. Before he moved to London he made purchases at the Northern Society in Leeds. In London he actively patronized artists including Landseer, Mulready, Leslie, Callcott and Cooke. His taste was for contemporary early Victorian cabinet pictures of anecdotal, sentimental, and instructive subjects, as well as scenes from literature. His collection was unique for its time being the only large scale one of contemporary British paintings. He gave his collection of 233 oils and 298 watercolours, etchings and drawings to the South Kensington museum in 1857 (see departmental file on Sheepshanks). The deed of gift stipulated that \u201ca well-lighted and otherwise suitable\u201d gallery should be built to house his collection near the buildings of the Science and Art department on the South Kensington Site. This followed Sheepshanks\u2019 wish to create a \u2018gallery of British art\u2019. The Sheepshanks Gallery was opened in 1857.",
