In making the paintings, Le Brun produced many sketches and studies which he decided to develop in printed form.  These were published as a suite of eight etchings in a portfolio. All were developed from photogravures. Photogravure is a process for transferring photographs - in this case photographs of Le Brun's Ring Cycle paintings - onto copper etching plates. Le Brun then proceeded to alter the imagery on the plates using conventional etching techniques; some were changed substantially, some very little.\n\nLe Brun is unusual in that he uses etching in the way that most artists use drawing, that is as a means of developing and experimenting with ideas which then feed back into his paintings.",
