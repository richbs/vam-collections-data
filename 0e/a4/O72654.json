In her biography \"Chanel\" (Grasset, 1974) Edmonde Charles-Roux charts the designer's liberating contributions to 20th century fashion and the evolution of her little black dresses. She observes that Chanel drew on her humble origins when she exploited the black of peasant costumes and made 'black the instrument of her success'. '1925 was the year of women in black' and between 1925 and 1927 black dresses (many by Chanel) had maximum exposure in fashion magazines, particularly Vogue. As well as revolutionary designs (her jersey suits etc.) Chanel produced 'mainstream' works such as this beaded dress. Her contemporaries were amazed when in the early 1920s she employed embroideresses and wondered if this meant the end of her severe and undecorated clothes - this was not the case. This dress has all the features associated with 1920s evening attire - a tubular, low-waisted shape lavishly beaded. The abstract geometric design is carefully disposed (the panels were embroidered to shape) over the garment and the cylindrical silhouette is broken by the tabbed skirt.\n\nWorn and given by Mrs Anthony Henley\nThe Cecil Beaton Collection\nT.86-1974"

It is sleeveless with a square-shape neckline and a straight long bodice. The dress is slightly larger from the hip level down. It has convoluted embroidered motifs on the bodice, and vertical stripes and motifs embroidered with golden thread on the skirt. Black silk drapes trim the side of the skirt, which is open from the knee. A black silk petticoat is attached at the bodice. Chanel designed it about 1922.\n\nThis evening dress of the early 1920s illustrates the transition between the romantic picture dress with its wide skirt and the more 'Cubist' straight and square shape of the mid 1920s. The stylised embroidered motifs were Chanel's trademark at this period. They witness her relationship with the Russian House of Kitmir, who embroidered exclusively for her.",
