            "public_access_description": "Furniture makers in Antwerp produced cabinets in a variety of qualities. They supplied a Europe-wide market for cabinets-on-stands, which were the most fashionable type of furniture at the time. The most luxurious were made to order for rich clients, both aristocrats and well-to-do merchants. The exuberant decoration of this cabinet, known as laque incrust\u00e9 (inlaid lacquer), was a technique for which Antwerp makers were famous.  It was an attempt to imitate Asian lacquer, reflecting the fact that Antwerp had close links with both Japan and China from the very beginning of the 16th century. The Portuguese, who had been the first to develop trade with East Asia, gave Antwerp a monopoly for the storage of spices and other goods brought from Asia. This cabinet was made with a matching table (W.7-1965), like many such cabinets. Sets might also include a matching mirror and a pair of candelestands.",

He returned to Britain after the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 and planned to build a large palace at Hamstead Marshall, Berkshire, for Queen Elizabeth. After she died in 1662 he continued to build the house as a memorial to her.  This cabinet and its matching table (W.7-1965) may well have been intended for that house, which was designed by the Dutch-born architect Sir Balthasar Gerbier (1592-1663) as a miniature version of her old home at Heidelburg Castle in Germany and took thirty years to construct.  The house was burnt to the ground in 1718.  The cabinet and table would have been highly fashionable objects at the time that plans for Hamstead Marshall were laid. \n\nThe pieces were later at Combe Abbey, Warwickshire, which the family owned until 1923, The cabinet is illustrated in a photograph of the east cloister taken ca. 1909 by <i>Country Life</i> (see Michael Hall, <i>The English Country House from the Archives of Country Life</i>.

            "historical_context_note": "Turtle-shell\nDe Kesel and Dhont suggest that the turtle-shell used in the Netherlands was mostly imported from the West Indies, and sold in Spanish and  Portuguese ports. Onto the reverse of the veneer, a (vermillion) paper or parchment  backing was glued on. Glue was applied to the base and the veneer pressed down using sand-filled heated cushions. Finally, the turtle-shell was polished. Glues were  made from boiling the hides, ears and sinews of hares, rabbits and beavers. Fish glue is  mentioned for gluing copper onto ebony. Ox-horn seems to have been explored as a  substitute. The pigments were traditional ones (azurite blue, vermillion red, orpiment yellow, green  earth). The black was probably carbon black. \n\nChastang says that in the 17th century the turtle-shell for furniture probably came from loggerhead (caretta caretta) and hawksbill (Chelone imbricata) turtles (whose shell is thicker than the green turtle, chelone mydas). They were found in the warm seas around Africa, Asia and America, in particular around the Caribbean Islands, Madagascar, Inonesia and the Seychelles \u2013 where they were hunted for their meat. Plates were removed from the upper body, and the underside or plastron (which are flatter), by boiling the bony carapace of the turtle. The plates, once removed, were flattened using hot salt water and pressure, and made smooth and even for use in furniture making by scraping and sanding. Pieces of turtle-shell can also be welded together using moisture, heat and pressure. Turtle-shell is good for decorative use because it is thermoplastic: it can be shaped when softened and will hold its shape once it re-hardens. \n\nSee Wilfried De Kesel and Greet Dhont, Flemish 17th century Lacquer Cabinets (Oostkamp,  2012)\nYannick Chastang, Paintings in Wood, French Marquetry Furniture.
