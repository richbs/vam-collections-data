He is led by a rope which is tied round his waist and held by a figure on the right of the panel. This figure wears a short, low-belted tunic with long sleeves, and a 'devil's cap' (a hat with a dragon rising from it). The Virgin Mary wearing a veil, a gown and a cloak, stands on a projection of ground on the left of the panel supporting one arm of the cross to ease Christ's ordeal. St. John the Evangelist, holding his emblem, a palm, is represented in the top left corner. Three more figures of executioners are seen at the top of the panel, the left-hand figure carrying a scourge and nails, the right-hand figure (top missing) carrying a hammer. The middle figure presses down on the arm of the cross to make is heavier. \n\nThe top corners of the panel are missing, although the top right corner has been repaired with plaster. There is a crack in the bottom centre of the panel and a hole in the alabaster. At the top of the panel between the heads of the executioners is a hole. Green paint, with a 'scrubbed' appearance, and the usual daisy pattern remain on the ground. The faces of the executioners are blackened. There are three lead-plugged holes in the back of the panel, two with latten wires attached. The surface is scored with a cross mark. The bottom has been cut away.",

This figure wears a short, low-belted tunic with long sleeves and a 'devil's cap' (a hat with a dragon rising from it) to illustrate his evil nature. \n\nThe right-hand figure above the cross presses down on it to increase the burden, while the Virgin Mary on the left supports it. \n\nThis panel formed part of the same altarpiece as A.17-1946 and A.18-1946.",
