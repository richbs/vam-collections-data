These highly realistic and dramatic wax tableaux served as \u2018memento mori\u2019, intended to inspire thoughts on mortality. Wax modelling had already acquired a certain status by the sixteenth century, as it is ideal for producing the type of intricate workmanship on a small scale which can be seen in this object, and enhanced by the use of colour and texture to mimic flesh. The inscription on the back of the frame, ' Mors malis vita bonis' is Latin for 'Death to the bad, life to the good' and is from the text of the Lauda Sion, which is a sequence sung during the Corpus Christi mass, written by the thirteenth-century theologian, Thomas Aquinas.",

However, more recently historian Gabriele Finaldi (1994, <u>op. cit.</u>) has attributed similar waxes, formerly on the New York art market, to the painter and sculptor Giovan Bernardino Azzolino (c.1572-1645), known to have been a wax-modeller, which also represent souls in Paradise, Purgatory and Hell, which suggests that these may also be by the same artist. \n\nPurchased from Ferrando, Rome, April 1931 by the Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine.
