He is in a stone cottage with a wooden ceiling and sits in front of a fire which is in a large stone fireplace. He is putting straw onto the fire. There is a stewpot in the fire with a fish tail hanging out of it. A dog sits behind him panting while a cat and a rat, possibly dead, lie at his feet. A bellows hangs on the side of the fireplace. On the back wall there is a storage cupboard which is next to some open shelving. There is a jug, some dishes and some cutlery or cooking implements on the shelves. The jug and dishes appear to be made of pewter. In the back right of the roundel a door opens onto a yard and there can be seen a woman bending down gathering grass.\n\nThe whole executed in brown/black pigment and silver stain and set in a border of blue glass with a painted inscription: \n\nHet is nu te ende wan ic mij...goede...[in nu] wel...serve got zie",

            "public_access_description": "The tale of Sorgheloos is a secular version of the New Testament parable of the Prodigal Son (Luke 15: 11\u201332). This type of story stemmed from Morality Plays, which were sponsored by trade and professional guilds in towns throughout medieval Europe. \n\nAlthough the Sorgheloos story was a popular one, few designs or roundels depicting it survive. There are several roundels in collections with the same images as the two in the Victoria and Albert Museum (Museum numbers: C.65 & 66-1929), but we do not know their design sources.\n\nThe story concerns a young man (Sorgheloos, or \u2018Carefree\u2019 in English) who squanders his fortune on gambling, loose woman and corrupt friends. When he becomes penniless, his friends desert him and he ends up destitute. So, unlike the parable related by St Luke, the story of Sorgheloos does not have a happy ending.\n\nThe other characters in the story are Weelde (Luxury), a woman; Gemack (Ease/Comfort), a male companion; Pouer (Poverty), a male beggar; Aermoede (Want), a woman; and Lichte Fortune (Fickle Fortune).\n\nThis roundel shows the final episode in the story. Penniless and alone, except for Aermoede, Sorgheloos sits in front of a fire with only grass to fuel it, cooking his fishtail supper. Aermoede is outside gathering straw.",

            "historical_context_note": "The tale of Sorgheloos is a secular version of the Biblical story of the Prodigal Son (Luke 15: 11-32). This type of story will have stemmed from the Morality plays sponsored by the trade and professional guilds of the towns throughout Medieval Europe. \n\nAlthough the Sorgheloos story was a popular one, not many designs or roundels depicting the story survive. There are several roundels in collections that have the same images as the two V&A ones (C.65 & 66-1929) but their design sources have not been identified.\n\nThe story concerns a young man (Sorgheloos or Carefree in English) who squanders his fortune on gambling, loose woman and corrupt friends. When he becomes penniless, his friends desert him and he ends up destitute. So, unlike the parable related by St. Luke, the story of Sorgheloos does not have a happy ending.\n\nThe characters in the story are Sorgheloos, Weelde (Luxury) - a woman, Gemack (Ease/Comfort), Pouer (Poverty), Aermoede (Wordly Pleasure) - a woman, and Lichte Fortune (Fickle Fortune).\n\nThis roundel shows the final episode in the story of Sorgheloos. Penniless and alone, except for Aermoede, he sits in front of a fire with nothing but grass to fuel it to cook his fishtail supper. Aermoede is outside gathering straw.",
