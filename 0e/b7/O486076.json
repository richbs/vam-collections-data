These would have been worn by a samurai, a member of the Japanese military class.  The knots would have originally helped to reinforce the seams, but by the nineteenth century when this garment was made, they were more decorative than functional.  The matching jacket and trouser ensemble is known as a hitatare.  This particular two-piece outfit may have been designed for wear under armour, the braids at the hem allowing the trousers to be gathered up and tucked into boots.   The Edo period (1615-1868) was a time of peace in Japan so there was no opportunity for samurai to engage in actual warfare.  However, armour would still be worn on ceremonial occasions and when provincial lords marched with their retinue in procession to and from the capital.  Hitate were made from rich and elaborately woven fabrics designed to emphasize the samurai's  status and enhance the dramatic effect of the whole outfit.",
