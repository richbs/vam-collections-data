Central Italian, second half of 15th century.<i>\nInscribed in ink</i> [...]vino <i>(part of the inscription cut off), and in pencil</i> Lievino. <i>\nPen and ink.</i>\nE.2-1941'\nWard-Jackson, Peter, Italian Drawings Volume I. 14th-16th century, London, 1979, pp. 235-236. The text is as follows: SCHOOL UNKNOWN mid 16th century 534 Design for a crozier On the edge of the sheet, in the left bottom corner, part of an inscriprion in ink in an old hand 'rino' and next to it in pencil another (indistinct) word which seems to read 'Pierino'; on the back two old inscriptions in ink in two different hands which seem to read 'meno' and 'Gottstein' Pen and ink 8 \u00bd x 3 5/8 (216 x 92) E.2-1941 PROVENANCE Bought 1941 Formerly catalogued as late 15th century. The left half of the sheet, showing another design of a crozier, was sold at Sotheby, 12 November 1964, part of the Victor Bloch collection, lot 3. It was described as North Italian, late 15th century. The left half of the inscription in the bottom left corner of our drawing is in the bottom right corner of the Bloch drawing and seems to read 'Pie', thus completing the name Pierino. On the back of the Bloch sheet are some slight sketches of pediments. The scrolls and strap ornament in these sketches are of a type not found before 1530. The elongated human figures roughly sketched in the niches of the crozier in our drawing are typical of mannerist art and likewise point to a date after 1530. The old attribution to Perino del Vaga has that much justification, though the drawing is not by him.",
