The style of embroidery is quite unusual: a striking design of meandering lines rather than the naturalistic floral patterns typically seen on earler embellished waistcoats. This abstract design is probably imitating the \u2018wave and flower\u2019 patterns of Italian woven silks of the 1620s and 1630s.  The sycamore motif used here may be symbolic of sorrowful love.  Also unusual is the waistcoat\u2019s modest fabric; a mix of cotton and linen, called fustian, which was often used for linings. The embroidery, however, is carried out in silver thread and embellished with silver bobbin lace and silver spangles.",

In 1686, John Grove married Mary Chaffyn, inheriting Zeals house from her and their descendants took the name Chaffyn Grove.  The waistcoat was once said to have been given to Mary Grove by Charles II, but is clearly of an earlier date.  In the 19th century, a female successory married into the Troyte Bullock family.\n\nHistorical significance: This is a fine example of informal women's dress in the 1630s.  While embroidered linen waistcoats of the period 1600-1630 survive in museum collections and appear in portraiture, this is an unusual example.  The rather coarse fustian, normally used for linings, has been richly embellished with silver thread, spangles and lace.  The rather abstract design of needlework shows the progression from the naturalistic style of a decade earlier.",
