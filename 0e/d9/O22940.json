She was the daughter of William and Hannah Hall, nee Townsend, of Penkhull & Kingsley Staffordshire. Laura Elizabeth Hall was the great, great, great aunt of the donor Mrs. A Redmayne.\n\nHistorical significance: The wax head and limbs are poured and hollow with the wax extremely thin and see through.  However, the facial characteristic and those of the limbs are based on solid wax heads.  As the doll was made about 1830 it shows a limked between the earlier solid heads and the refinement of the later sophisticated poured heads.",
