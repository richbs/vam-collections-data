The vessel can be filled through another opening towards the rear. The decoration in lustre shows a heraldic lion in a shield and the inscription 'SURGE DOMINE', repeated seven times. The inscription which can be found on several pieces of Spanish lustreware is short for 'Exsurge Domine ad liberandum nos' which translates 'Rise Lord to free us'. It is derived from an important Papal bull, issued at Worms on 15th June 1520, condemning the errors of Martin Luther.\nPouring vessels in the shape of animals and mostly made in bronze were popular during the medieval period. They were used together with a basin to wash the hands at the table before a meal. They were also used in church the cleanse the priest's hands before the Eucharist. The inscription on our pouring vessel suggests that it might have been used in a Christian (Catholic) context.",
