            "public_access_description": "This work playfully examines the illusion and traditions of both painting and photography. A \u2018real\u2019 vase of sunflowers, undoubtedly referencing Van Gogh, sits next to a painted version arranged to appear in correct perspective for the camera. In a further twist, the photograph is printed on watercolour paper. Although Hockney\u2019s title seems to denounce photography, the work ironically relies on the camera for its execution.",
