The printers, Hildesheimer and Faulkner, described the series in 1882, 'A. Ludovici contributes some clever satirical sketches of Esthetes, then in the time of Patience\",  the favourite butts for mild ridicule'. 'Patience' here refers to the Gilbert and Sullivan comic-opera whose lyrics included a description of an aesthetic young man:\n\n   'A Japanese young man\n   A blue and white young man\n   Francesca di Rimini miminy piminy\n Je-ne-sais-quoi young man!\n\n    A pallid and thin young man\n A haggard and lank young man\n A greenery-yallery Grosvenor Gallery\nFoot-in-the-grave young man!'\n\n    The card's title compares to a poem published by the magazine Punch in the previous year (1881) which ended with a reference to Oscar Wilde:\n\n   'And many a maiden will mutter \n When Oscar Looms large on her sight\n He's quite too consummately utter\n As well as too utterly quite'.\n\n    Materials & Making\n Greetings cards began to be first printed by colour lithography in the 1860s. Until this point the cards were generally handmade.  With the advent of steam-powered presses and other technological improvements it was possible to mass-produce comparatively cheap colour-printed images for the first time.",
