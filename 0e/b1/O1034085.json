The portfolio includes two works by the Computer Technique Group, plus single works by Charles Csuri and James Shaffer, William Fetter, Maughan S. Mason, Donald K. Robbins, and Kerry Strand. The complete set was acquired by the Museum in 1969, at a cost of \u00a35 plus postage.\n\nA number of examples of Mason's work were included in the Cybernetic Serendipity exhibition. The same image is reproduced (in black and white, and reversed) in the book accompanying the exhibition (p.92). According to the Cybernetic Serendipity catalogue, his works were produced using an analogue computer. They were previously displayed at the Salt Lake Art Center, Salt Lake City.\n\nMaughan Sterling Mason was born in Ogden, Utah, in 1931. He received a Master of Science degree in physics in 1953 and went on to become president of the Society for Computer Simulation. He worked for IBM as a computer programmer for 25 years, in Palo Alto, California.",
