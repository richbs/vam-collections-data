They first appeared in the 1780s as part of the general refinement of dining customs among the middle classes. Silversmiths initially explored a variety of designs, including articulated racks, before the simple arrangement of parallel arches became standard.\n\nThis piece was made by Hester Bateman. She was a successful woman silversmith who learned her trade from her husband and set up in her own right on his death in 1760. She probably managed the workshop rather than made the silver herself.\n\nThe firm produced cheaper, thin-gauge domestic tablewares using a limited range of ornament for largely middle-class customers. Members of her family, including her daughter-in-law Ann and her son Peter, joined the business and continued it after her retirement in 1790. Insurance documents for 1802 show that the firm, with its own steam-operated flatting mill, was one of the most technologically advanced in London. Bateman silver was exported to retailers and customers all over England and North America.",
