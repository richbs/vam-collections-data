But when it was revealed that he was a Christian, Diocletian let him be tied to a tree and he was shot with arrows and left there to die. When a widow called Irene came to bury him, she discovered that no arrow had touched any vital parts of the body and she could heal him back to health.  Sebastian then again confronted himself before Diocletian with his sins and was then beaten to death.\n\nIn this statue there are no arrows.",
