He designed the Indian Section of the 1877 Paris Exhibition, and arranged the Indian collections at South Kensington in 1880. It is not clear whether or not these designs were intended for the museum, or were bought for himself, as they are are clearly marked \"Purdon Clarke Collection\" in the hand of his son, Caspar Stanley Clarke, who became Keeper of the Indian Department.",
