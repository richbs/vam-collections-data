            "public_access_description": "Sandro Botticelli (1444/5-1510) was trained in Florence in the studio of Fra Filippo Lippi and joined the Compagnia di S Luca in 1472. Botticelli made the most of his career in Florence under the patronage of the Medici although he was summoned to Rome by Pope Sixtus IV in 1481, together with Ghirlandaio and Cosimo Rosselli, to join Perugino in decorating the walls of the Sistine Chapel. From ca. 1490, his style changed quite significantly due to a deeper crisis of style and expression. As a result his style soon waned and he died in poverty in Florence in 1510. Among his assistants and pupils were Filippino Lippi (ca.1457-1504), Bartolomeo di Giovanni (active 1488-ca.1500) and Jacopo del Sellaio (ca. 1441-1493).\n\nThis painting is a typical example of Botticelli's early portraits. The identity of the sitter, Smeralda Bandinelli, wife of Viviano Bandinelli and grandmother of the 16th century sculptor Baccio Bandinelli, derives from the inscription on the window frame. She wears a summer at-home costume comprising a white silk or linen camisa generously cut as the many folds at the neck and sleeves show; a 'cotta' of red silk, slit and laced fashionably at the forearms to reveal the 'camisa'; and, overall, a 'gonella' or summer overgown of sheer gold edged fabric with loose cuffs and open from the waist to show the silk beneath.",

Smeralda would have been allowed only two overgowns of silk in her wardrobe and only one overgown dyed with the rare red kermes dye we see here. The approved garments would have been marked and would have been worn for at least three years. \n\nOver her shoulders and tucked into the neckline is a sheer silk kerchief. As befitting a young married woman, another covers her neatly confined hair. This kerchief should also be sheer but seems to have been overpainted in the 19th century. A delicate metalwork necklace of the type popular in the late 15th century circles her neck. She holds the white, embroidered handkerchief of a refined lady. Less wealthy women wore similar clothes, only cut less fully and of coarser materials.\n\nThe window shutter projecting strangely through an opening behind her may, with the column, shallow setting, and uneven number of lacings at her wrists, add up to a personal symbolism of the kind seen in other Botticelli portraits. \n\nHer quiet dignity recalls the contemporary description by Lorenzo the Magnificent of his Ideal Beauty: 'Her beauty, as I have said was wonderful ... the tone of her complexion was white yet not pallid, fresh yet not glowing. Her face was grave yet not proud, sweet and pleasing, not frivolous or lighthearted. Her eyes were animated and motionless with no trace of conceit or meanness ... She dressed in those fashions which suited a noble and gentle lady ... ' (J. Herald, <i>Renaissance Dress in Italy, 1400-1500</i>, London, 1981, p.157-8)\n \nThis sort of beauty appealed to another poet 400 years later: The Pre-Raphaelite poet and admirer of Botticelli, Dante Gabrielle Rossetti. Rossetti purchased the portrait in 1867 when Botticelli had just been 'rediscovered'. He sold the painting in the early 1880's, probably to Constantine Ionides, who bequeathed it to the Museum.\n\nMarilyn Gasparini\"\nKauffmann, C.M., <u>Catalogue of Foreign Paintings, I. Before 1800,</u> London, Victoria and Albert Museum, 1973, p. 37-39, cat. no. 37.\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"Sandro BOTTICELLI (1444/45-1510) \n<i>Italian (Florentine) School</i> \nBorn in Florence in 1444 or '45, Sandro Filipepi, known as Botticelli, was a pupil of Fra Filippo Lippi and was also influenced, particularly in his early work, by Andrea del Verrocchio. An independent master from about 1467, he worked mainly in Florence and was the favourite painter of Lorenzo and Giuliano dei Medici. In 1481-82 he was in Rome working on his frescoes in the Sistine Chapel. In his last years he came under the influence of Savonarola. \n\n37 \nSMERALDA BANDINELLI, GRANDMOTHER \nOF THE SCULPTOR BACCIO BANDINELLI \n<i>Tempera on panel</i> \n25 7/8 X 16 1/8 (65.7 X 41) \nIonides Bequest \nCAI.100\n \nThe traditional ascription to Botticelli was never questioned until 1899, when Berenson attributed CAI.100 to 'Amico di Sandro'. This was his name for an unknown artist who, he claimed, was the true author of certain paintings of the 1460s and '70s hitherto attributed to Filippo Lippi, Botticelli and Filippino Lippi. Doubts having been expressed, it was subsequently listed as a school work by Plunkett (1900) and in Horne's great book (1908), though even at this time its authenticity was vigorously defended by H. T. Kroeber (1911). \n     1921 saw the publication of Bode's <i>Botticelli</i> and with it the virtual destruction of 'Amico di Sandro'. Several of the paintings attributed by Berenson to this artist, including Smeralda Bandinelli, were re-assigned to Botticelli. Nearly all subsequent authorities have confirmed Bode's opinion, and in his list of 1932 Berenson himself dropped the 'Amico' and gave Smeralda back to the master. This painting fits well with Botticelli's other portraits. For example the so-called <i>Caterina Sforza</i> (Altenburg Museum) and the <i>Young Man</i> formerly in the Museo Filangieri, Naples, have similar architectural features that appear to have the sitter closely hemmed in on all sides. This convention was derived from Botticelli's teacher, Filippo Lippi (M. Pittaluga, <i>Filippo Lippi</i>, Florence, 1949, figs. 72-3).\n     The dating has varied, but there can be little doubt that it is an early work of about 1471. This date fits with the approximate age of the sitter. \n     On the back of the picture are two labels with inscriptions in the hand of Dante Gabriel Rossetti, who owned it from 1867 until about 1880: \n(I) '(from the Pourtal\u00e8s collection). Portrait of Smeralda Bandinelli painted by Sandro Botticelli. The property of D. G. Rossetti, 16 Cheyne Walk, Chelsea'. \n(2) 'the inscription at the bottom of the picture reads: \"Smeralda di ... Bandinelli moglie di . . . Bandinelli\". The two male Christian names are illegible. The portrait evidently represents the same head which appears in the central personage of Botticelli's \"Spring\" at Florence.'\n     The inscription referred to appears, somewhat oddly, on the window-sill at the bottom of the picture. Rossetti's reading can be accepted, with the addition of 'Vi . .' as the opening letters of the husband's Christian name. Smeralda Bandinelli may be identified as the grandmother of Baccio Bandinelli (1488-1560), the Florentine sculptor. She was born Smeralda Donati and was the first wife of Viviano de Gajuole, a craftsman in metals (<i>maniscalco</i>), who had settled in Florence shortly after 1450 and married a few years later. Their first son, Michelangelo, the goldsmith and father of Baccio, was born in 1459. (Vasari, ed. Milanesi, vi, pp. 133,196). However, the family was not called Bandinelli until Baccio adopted the name in about 1530, in an attempt to prove his descent from the Sienese nobility. The inscription, therefore, with the anachronistic name Smeralda Bandinelli, must have been added after c. 1530. It has even been suggested (Ulmann) that it is purely apocryphal, but as Smeralda was a person of relative obscurity, not even mentioned in the pre-Milanesi editions of Vasari's life of Baccio, it seems unlikely that she would attract the hand of a forger. Probably Smeralda was the sitter and the inscription added by way of formal identification by a member of the family in the later 16th or 17th century. As her first child was born in 1459 one could place the date of her birth c. 1440-43, which would mean she was about thirty when the portrait was painted.\n     Neither Rossetti's suggestion that Smeralda 'represents the same head' as Botticelli's <i>Spring</i>, nor that of Schmarsow, that she may have served as a model for his <i>Fortitude</i> (Uffizi) is very convincing. These are all early works, and the resemblance can best be explained as being due to the artist's style at that time.\n     Acquired in 1867 by Rossetti (who is said to have retouched the back of the head), this picture has an honourable place in the 'rediscovery' of Botticelli, which occurred in England from about 1860 and which culminated in his hero-worship by the later Victorians. \n\n<i>Condition.</i> Considerably retouched, particularly on the face and hair. \n<i>Prov.</i> Pourtal\u00e8s Collection, sold Paris, March 1865 (3,400 francs); Colnaghi, sold Christie's, 23 Mar. 1867, lot 1970, Howell, \u00a320 for D.

            "historical_context_note": "The attribution of this painting, certainly a good example of early portraits by Botticelli probably executed during the early to mid-1470s, was much discussed in the past few decades. It was accepted as an autograph work by Ulmann (1893), Kroeber (1911), Bode (1921), Schmarsow (1923), Van Marle (1931), Gamba (1936)  Salvini (1958), Kauffmann (1973) and Lightbown (1978) but dismissed by Plunkett (1900), Horne (1908) and A. Venturi (1925). Formerly rejected by Berenson in 1899, he finally admitted it in 1932. \n\nIt shows the portrait of a woman, bust-length in three-quarter profile, in a domestic interior. The sitter is traditionally identified as Smeralda Bandinelli, wife of Viviano Bandinelli and supposed grandmother of the famous 16th-century sculptor, Baccio Bandinelli (1488-1560). Baccio bandinelli the Younger is probably responsible for the additional inscription on the window frame, (Rubin in London, 1999-2000, citing Waldman; Hegener 2008), confirming that the work was, at that time, owned by the Bandinelli family. \n\nThe sitter's marital status can be confirmed by the column in the window, which was a common symbol of fortitude and constancy, the most important virtues requested in a wife. The half-closed door in the background may allude to the cloistered existence of the women in the Florentine society. An analogous configuration appears in Botticelli\u2019s portrait of Giuliano de\u2019 Medici in Washington, probably painted shortly after his murder in April 1478. \n\nThe sitter wears a loose-fitting cotton dress, known as a \u2018guarnello\u2019, over an expensive red gown called \u2018gamurra\u2019, and a customary \u2018camisa\u2019 or chemise. Her only jewellery is a simple necklace, and her hair is demurely dressed under a linen headgear. In many ways this portrait corresponds to the canonical representation of women during the 15th century, partly influenced by the Petrarchian ideal of beauty: blond hair, red lips and pale complexion. \n\nThese portraits differ in many ways from the notion of portraiture commonly held today as they especially aimed to represent an idealised image of the sitter and reflect therefore a different conception of identity. The sitter's likeness was more or less recognisable but his particular status and familiar role were represented in his garments and attributes referring to his character. The 16th century especially developed the ideal of metaphorical and visual attributes through the elaboration of highly complex portrait paintings in many formats including at the end of the century full-length portraiture. Along with other devices specific to the Italian Renaissance such as birth trays (deschi da parto) and wedding chests' decorated panels (cassoni or forzieri), portrait paintings participated to the emphasis on the individual.\n\nHowever unlike traditional 15th-century Florentine portraits which favoured stiff and static profile portraits, Botticelli\u2019s sitter looks out at the beholder while her gesture, a hand resting on a window frame, mimes an attempt to interact with her surroundings. In doing so, Botticelli may have responded to examples of Flemish portraiture, which typically revealed more of the face and used fictive windows as frame.  This representation does not reflect either the social convention of female portraiture, which required depicting their eyes lowered as a sign of modesty and obedience. The austere Franciscan moralist San Bernardino (1380-1444) even exhorted women to \u2018bury [their] eyes\u2019.\n\nIt has been suggested by Stefan Weppelmann (2011), citing Zollner (2005), that the sense of movement and directness in the portrait is evidence of Botticelli's intention to produce a life-like image, which could in turn suggest that the painting has a possible memorialising function. The separation of the sitter from the viewer by the window frame is thought to indicate the separation from the viewer after the death of the sitter. Weppelmann also suggests that the panel's uncommonly large size could suggest an official purpose related to memoria.\n\nThe subject-matter of CAI.100 brings to mind especially section XXXV of Dante's <i>Vita Nuova</i> called 'La donna nella finestra' (The lady at the window): \n'...I paused thinking deeply, and with sad thoughts, so much so that it made me seem to have an aspect of terrible distress...Then I saw a gentle and very lovely young lady, who was looking at me so pitifully from a window, showing so much in her face that all pity seemed concentrated in her...And so I decided to write a \"sonetto\", in which I would speak of her...(<i>Vita Nuova, The New Life of Dante Alighieri,</i> A.S. Kline tr., London, 2001).\n\n It is possible that Botticelli had Dante\u2019s model in mind as he was among the most erudite artists of his time. In the 1490s Botticelli worked on a major cycle of illustrations to Dante's <i>Divine Commedy,</i> and it is likely that he would also have been familiar with Dante's <i>Vita Nuova.</i>This coincidence appears to have been clearly apparent to a 19th century owner of the painting, Dante Gabriele Rossetti, as in 1879 he painted a picture of a beautiful half-length young woman at a window (now Harvard University Art Museums) with the title 'La Donna nella Finestra', clearly derived from Botticelli (See Gail S. Weinberg, in <i>Burlington Magazine</i> CXLVI (Jan 2004) pp. 20-26).",
