Many different types of mechanical bear were produced during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. This clockwork bear moves its head and arm to simulate playing the balalaika, a traditional Russian stringed instrument. It was intended for export or as a tourist souvenir and was brought back from Russia by a friend of the donor.",
