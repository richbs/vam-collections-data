            "physical_description": "<u>Design</u>\nDesk and bookcase in two tiers, the lower raised on shaped bracket feet supporting a flaring bases, under three long drawers below a sloping front, the upper with two doors enclosing shelves, below a shaped and pierced cresting. The desk and bookcase is veneered all over the outside with mother-of-pearl in panels filled with repeating patterns of curved interlocking shapes, most the small plaques of mother-of-pearl outlined and separated by thin fillets of tropical hardwood. The drawers of the lower tier are set with small, turned knobs, silvered. These appear to be an attempt to re-create the original knobs, to replace brass bail handles with pierced rococo backplates that were added to the drawers at some time. The interior of the writing compartment is set with a bank of six drawers above a shallow recess lined with blue paper, the sides painted blue, the drawer fronts and inside of the slope veneered in tropical hardwoods in a pattern of lozenges.\nThe marquetry of mother-of-pearl is divided into panels outlined with double bands of mother-of-pearl pieces separated by a serpentine fillet of hardwood. On the doors of the upper tier the same running motif defines a central panel on each, that in turn is divided vertically into two the same serpentine band. Between these bands the ground is filled with a repeating pattern of elongated quatrefoils composed of interlocking sections of circles, of different sizes, around two conjoined figure-of-eight pieces, with one half of the 8 smaller than the other.  This framing and ground pattern is also used on the sides and the front of the lower tier, with different proportion, to articulate the individual panels and drawer fronts. More elaborate elements are worked into the marquetry in places: formalized tulips in shield-shaped reserves at the corner of each cupboard door; a larger 8-shaped motif centering the panels on the lower sides; additional leaf motifs filling  the trapezoidal centre of the upper sides of the lower tier, which are treated as separate panels; and a large, shaped cartouche centrally on the slope, flanked by quatrefoil motifs with plant forms forming a square at each side. \nThe marquetry inside the writing compartment shows, on each drawer, a framing of dark wood, possibly bocote (<i>cordial elaeagnoides</i>) or Coracao de Negro (<i>Swartzia benthamania</i>) with an inner stringing of a light hardwood, possibly Amarillo (c<i>entrilobium spp.</i>), with a lozenge banding of the same dark and light woods, against a ground of a mid-toned reddish wood (possibly grenadillo or platymiscum yucatanum). The small drawers are set with turned knobs of the dark wood, each with a central plaque of mother-of-pearl.  Similar woods to those used on the small drawers have been used in the large lozenge motif on the inside of the doors and the flap. None of the woods has been analysed microscopically.  The doors of the upper section are lined with  The fall-front shows a larger design of interlocking lozenges in the same woods. \n\n<u>Construction</u>\nThe desk and bookcase is constructed in solid tropical hardwood (possibly grenadillo \u2013 it shows the strongly contrasting heartwood of that timber) in boards 2 cm thick. There is very apparent sapwood in this timber, particularly visible in the small drawers, with clear rays on the area between the heartwood and sapwood. \nThe  lower tier is made in one piece, including the writing compartment. The case is constructed with mitred dovetails, the mitreing visible at the back corners.  The backboard of four horizontal boards (of the same wood as the case) is set within a rebate cut in the top, sides and base of the case and is held in place with wooden nails (trenails), with some screws added more recently. The case sits on a frame composed of blocks of carcase wood (one on each side and three along the front), which are glued to its underside.  The flaring base mouldings are glued to this, rising just above the joint with the carcase. The feet, which are composed of multiple blocks of hardwood are glued to a single vertical at each corner, rectangular in section and longer on the front and back edges, with shorter boards forming the sides of the feet, the angle being filled with blocks of wood. \nThe flap is probably a single board, now showing curvature across it width. It is cut at an angle on the front and back edges to fit the carcase and is fitted with two brass butt hinges (replacements, showing infill to adjacent veneers) and with a replacement brass lock (also showing infill on the veneer behind).\nThe interior of the writing compartment is composed of two horizontal and two vertical, interlocking boards, inserted from the back and set in shallow channels cut in the sides and top of the case. The recess below the drawers is set at either side with a square-sectioned compartment running the full depth of the case, to contain the lopers that flank the top long drawer. Each of these is made of two boards, glued and pinned together and partially held in place by the blue paper that lines the bottom of the recess, the sides of which are painted blue to match in the area to the front of the drawers. \nAll the drawers, large and small, are constructed in hardwood, dovetailed, with mitred dovetails at the front, the bases (with grain running laterally) are set in rebates on the fronts and sides, running under the bases where they are nailed up with trenails.  The drawers are slightly trapezoidal in plan.  In each case they are wider at the front than the back (7 mm wider on each small drawer).  The drawer cavities are perfectly rectangular.  The difference is made up with tapering slips of another hardwood (possibly mahogany) glued to either side of the drawers, in the manner of vertical runners. Similar tapering slips are glued on the top of each drawer side.  The only explanation that seems possible for this (given that it was clearly done at the time of manufacture and that the drawers appear to fit tightly at the front) is to avoid problems with the movement of the carcase wood because of changes in humidity, offering an area of wood that could be planed off if the drawers began to stick. \nThe upper tier is of similar construction to the base, with two full-width shelves inserted from the back of the case.  The backboard, of three horizontal boards of hardwood, is of similar construction to that on the lower tier and is fitted in the same way, with trenails as fixings.  At the lower edge of the back on each side are small iron screw eyes, presumably for receiving hooks fixed to the wall.\nThe doors are each hung with two brass butt hinges.  These have been replaced, with long sections of repair to the veneers behind them suggesting that they replaced strap hinges. The doors appear to be each made of three vertical boards, cleated top and bottom, with the top cleats deeper (13 cm) than the bottom (5cm).  The lock on the leading edge of the right-hand door has been replaced, leaving marks in the veneer.  On the left door the brass striker plate is a replacement with similar evidence in the veneers.  The brass bolt at the base of the leading edge of the left-hand door is also a replacement.  The cupboard doors are veneered in a similar pattern to that on the flap, and the inside of the cupboard with smaller lozenges similar in scale to those on the small drawers of the writing compartment. Both the upper and lower surfaces of the shelves are veneered in this way.  The front edges of the shelves are veneered with the palest wood, fixed with small pins of wood.  At the sides the backboard has shrunk and reveals that the veneers are approximately 3 mm thick. \nThe cresting is in three sections, each cut from a single softwood board.  They are attached with softwood glue blocks to the top of the upper tier, these also screwed in place. The front cresting has an additional central support running almost the full height behind the cresting.",

The form is based on an early 18th-century English design for what was then called a 'desk and bookcase' and is now more often called a 'bureau'.  This type of furniture spread across Europe and from various European states to their colonial territories.  The very practical form had a long life and was popular, for instance, in the newly independent United States of America at the end of the 18th century.  The materials used and the ornament chosen, differed according to the country. In India, such a piece might be veneered in ivory inlaid into local woods.  This piece is built with woods found in Central America, but veneered with small pieces of mother-of-pearl that were possibly imported from the rivers of China.  We think that this bureau dates from the end of the 18th century or the first years of the 19th but we have little information about it and would be very pleased to have information about similar pieces.",

Pieces of furniture covered in marquetry of mother-of-pearl have been attrbuted to Mexico, but also the the Phillipines.  The woods used for the carcase and marquetry might give closer identification if they were analysed.  By eye they appear to be tropical hardwoods of the kind found in Central and South America.  When the cabinet was first inspected by staff of the museum it was dated to the middle of the 18th century (when the form would have been fashionable in Britain) but the apparently original knobs on the innner drawers and the evidence for knobs on the larger drawers, suggest that it may have been made in the very late 18th century or the first years of the 19th.",
