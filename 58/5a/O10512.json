The composition shows the Virgin and Child in the immediate foreground seated on an elevated terrain and accompanied by enthusiastic music-making putti.  Beyond the Virgin extends a landscape that features in the middle distance a palace and its grounds, including a fountain, a fenced garden, and various outbuildings.  While a peasant fells a tree at left, putti appear by the fountain and angels near the palace, giving the terrestrial setting a celestial air.  A forested landscape beyond leads the eye over rugged terrain to the horizon.  the landscape has the jagged, rocky outcroppings that are characteristic of the work of Joachim Patinir and Herri met de Bles but less common in Bening's own miniatures.  The features of the middle ground are note-worthy, especially the majestic palace and its subordinate structures, the depiction of which has the character of a portrait of an estate.  Perhaps the painting was commissioned by the lord of the estate that is represented here.\nThe work is also striking for the artist's extensive quotations from Jan Gossaert's Malvagna Triptych (Palermo, Galleria Nazionale), including the groups of musical angels beside the Virgin and the fountain behind her to the left.  Bening draws upon Gossaert's art repeatedly during the 1530s and quoted the Malvagna Triptych elsewhere (cat. no. 150).  It was the beginning of the 1530s that the great Spanish patron Mencia de Mendoza employed Gossaert as her court artist, at a time when she and her spouse, Henry III of Nassau, the chamberlain of Charles V, also engaged Bening's services (cat. no. 149).  Yet in the handling of space, with the elevated foreground and elaborately constructed recession, the work recalls most closely Bening's late cycle of London calender miniatures (cat. no. 159).  Therefore the painting, difficult to date very precisely, might be as late as the end of the 1540s.\"",
