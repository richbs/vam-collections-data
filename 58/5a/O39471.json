The catalogue is rectangular in shape and of portrait proportions: it consists of two sheets of printed white paper folded and stapled into a pale blue card cover which has the title and four illustrations of characters from 'Hey Diddle Diddle' and 'Humpty Dumpty' printed in blue on the front.  The text on the first page suggests that the items in this range are ideal for children's Christening and birthday presents, and indicates that the products are also available with decorative motifs illustrating 'Old Mother Hubbard', 'Old Woman in Shoe', 'Jack & Jill' and 'Little Miss Muffet'.  Each of the following pages is illustrated with a different set decorated with motifs from a different rhyme or story (although all the articles were in fact available in all the patterns): 'Little Boy Blue', 'Humpty Dumpty', 'Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary', 'Old King Cole', 'Hey Didle Diddle', 'The Three Bears' and 'The House That Jack Built'.  The sets range from plate, mug, egg cup, serviette ring, knife, fork spoon and teaspoon (all in a presentation case) to a matching spoon and pusher, each set being priced separately.",
