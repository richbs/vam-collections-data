He designed the chapel with great economy, incorporating sculptural compositions which he had originally designed for other locations.  The Crucifix is a replica of the Crucifix which Giovanni Bologna had executed of the Duke of Bavaria in 1594 (in St, Michael's Church, Munich), while the six bronze reliefs of the Passion on the altar of the chapel are replicas of those he executed for the Grimaldi Chapel in San Francesco di Castelletto, Genoa, 1579-85 (now in Genoa University). Wax models by Giovanni Bologna for three of the six Passion Reliefs are also in the collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum (museum nos. 328 to 330-1879).",
