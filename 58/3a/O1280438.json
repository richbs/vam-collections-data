Charles Blondin made his first appearance at the age of 5 under the name of \"The Boy Wonder\" and spent the early part of his career performing in France and America. He first appeared in London in 1861 at the Crystal Palace, turning somersaults on stilts on a rope stretched across the central transept, 70 feet (20 m) from the ground.  By 1869 Blondin was a regular performer at the Crystal Palace and had created a specially adapted bicycle, which he called a Velociped, as part of his act. Blondin's fame was such that he attracted a host of imitators worldwide, and it is likely that this performer deliberately adopted a stage name which alluded to Blondin's success.\n \nThe 'Weston's Music Hall' named in the title of the engraving was a music hall and theatre that opened on the 16th of November 1857 at 242-245 High Holborn. The purpose built music hall offered its audiences (which often numbered in excess of 300 people), ample food and drink, together with a varied programme of comic and musical acts, to keep them entertained throughout the evening.",
