The suit is completed by a matching turban-style hat in claret and black, and a hand-embroidered silk blouse in delicate blue-grey.",

V&A Publications, London, 1997, pp. 40, 41, and 137.\nCaption written by Amy de la Haye for Haute Couture exhibition publication, 2007.\nClaret red wool suit. \nHas distinctive wedge-shaped double flaps which accentuates the hips. These are heavily canvassed with horse hair or horse hair and crin to create the shape.\nThe skirt is cut in five panels and has six knife pleats at the back.\nIt was worn with a pale blue-grey crepe de Chine blouse with faggoting, self-coloured hand embroidered seed stitch and tucking. The blouse was bought ready-made and is labelled \u2018Givans, 112-114 New Bond Street, W1\u2019.\n\nThis ensemble forms part of a larger group of clothes worn by Mrs Ralph Dent (1894-1973) which date from 1920 (her trousseau lingerie) to 1950. It comprised haute couture clothing from top London fashion houses, including seven ensembles and two hats from Lachasse. (Footnote: a number of pieces were accepted by the V&A and the rest was passed to Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery as Mrs Dent  - nee Keen \u2013 had spent her childhood.)\nThe V&A\u2019s Archive of Art and Design houses Lachasse\u2019s account books and reveals that Mrs Dent, and her daughter, placed regular orders for coats, suits, dresses and hats, and had several alterations undertaken, by Lachasse between 1938-1955. \nMuseum documentation dated this suit to 1948-1949, but there is no reference to it in the account books. However, there is reference to a `red cloth suit\u2019 and with red and black jersey hat purchased in May 1954 at a cost of 58s.16d for the suit and 10s10d for the hat.\nDe la Haye, A., 'Material Evidence' in Wilcox, C., ed., <i>The Golden Age of Couture: Paris and London 1947-57</i> (V&A Publications, London), p.96\nMr Owen - known as 'Owen at Lachasse' - was designer at Lachasse from 1953, when Michael Don\u00e9llan left to open his own house.  Owen designed a claret-red wool suit chosen by Mrs Dent.  The jacket has distinctive wedge-shaped double pocket flaps and the skirt, knife-pleated in the back, was shortened during the course of its wear.  The suit was worn with a red and black jersey hat from Lachasse and an embroidered and fagotted blue-grey cr\u00eape-de-chine blouse labelled 'Givans'.  The V&A originally dated this suit to around 1948 but research in the sales ledgers of the Lachasse archive [in the AAD] reveals that it was in fact purchased in May 1954.  (Stylistically it could have been designed at either time.)  These fascinating ledgers document the purchasing patterns of Lachasse's clientele and reveal the prices they paid.  The suit cost \u00a358.6s (about \u00a31,200 by 2006 prices) and the hat \u00a310.10s (about \u00a3200).  The ledgers show that Mrs Dent and her daughter placed regular orders for coats, suits, dresses and hats, and also had several alterations undertaken between 1938 and 1955.",

Owen designed this claret-red wool suit chosen by Mrs Dent.  The V&A originally dated this suit to around 1948 but research in the sales ledgers of the Lachasse archive [in the AAD] reveals that it was in fact purchased in May 1954. The suit cost \u00a358.6s (about \u00a31,200 by 2006 prices) and the hat \u00a310.10s (about \u00a3200).  The ledgers show that Mrs Dent and her daughter placed regular orders for coats, suits, dresses and hats, and also had several alterations undertaken between 1938 and 1955.\n\nThe blouse from Givans: a small scale London couturier / fashion house. Established by Mr. Givan in the 1920s or 30s to sell fine Irish linen goods. Created the wedding dress and trousseau for Mary, youngest daughter of Winston Churchill, and outfits for the Colvilles, who accompanied Lord Mountbatten as last Vice Roy to India. Located on the corner of New Bond St and Brook St, London.\n\nThe fashion doll, 'Miss Virginia Lachasse' [Fashion Museum, Bath], created by Lachasse in 1954, wears a blue tweed suit and jersey turban of a similar style.",
