They originated in the 1440s with the desire to reproduce coins and hardstone engravings from ancient Greece and Rome. Some were made as collector\u2019s pieces, to be viewed and displayed in private, and others for practical purposes. They also inspired designs in other media, from architecture to bookbindings. Bernardi moved from Ferrara to Rome in 1530. He worked primarily for the cardinal and papal courts and became known as an engraver of rock crystals. Many of his plaquettes are based on these carvings. This example was taken from a crystal plaque in the collection of Cardinal Ippolito de\u2019 Medici.\n\nThe Rape of the Sabines is a legend in the early history of Rome. According to that Romulus, the founder of the city, used a trick to secure the future population of Rome. He organised a festival where the neighbouring inhabitants were invited, including the Sabines along with their wives and children. At a certain signal Rome's young men went into the crowd and carried away the unmarried wives. Plutarch has described to this legend the origin of the custom of lifting up a bride and carrying her over the doorstep of her husband's house.",
