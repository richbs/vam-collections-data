It appears to have been assembled together with other mid-16th-century elements,including the side blocks, to make this chair. The seat and the apron below were probably replaced in the 19th century. The chair is thought to have  have been used as a dining room or library chair, although in the guise of a throne. \n\nDecoration\nThe outer edges of the chair-back are decorated with a Gothic crest, while the central panel with the profile portrait of female figure in a medallion is in the manner of the mid-16th-century 'Romayne' (Roman) decorations at Falkland Palace in Fife and Stirling Castle (both in Scotland), and the Salkeld Screen in Carlisle Cathedral, Cumbria.\n\nPeople\nThis chair is thought to have formed part of an antiquarian collection and may have belonged to Sir William Fraser (1816-1898). This leading Scottish genealogist owned similar furniture, which was recorded in a photograph of a room of his house at 32 Castle St., Edinburgh, taken soon after his death.",

            "history_note": "The chair was part of the 'remarkable collection of antique Scotch furniture and relics which belonged to the late Sir William Fraser' sold at Dowell's saleroom in Edinburgh on 3 December 1898. It fetched 50 guineas. Sir William Fraser (1816-1898) was Assistant Keeper of the Records of Scotland and left a bequest for the first ever Chair of Scottish History at the University of Edinburgh.\n\nScottish armchair, purchased from Muirhead Moffat & Co, Glasgow, 15 Nov. 1950\n\nR.P. 50/2897\n\n\n\nListed on Purchase Form\n\"Oak box-chair - - first half of 16th century Scottish - - \u00a3150\"\n\n4/10/50 Letter, Muirhead Moffat & Co. to V & A\nenclosing photographs of an \"extremely rare oak chair \" and requesting information on its history.  Their own opinion is that the chair is \"in its original condition with the exception of the worn feet and a repair to part of the front leg.  The colour is good and the chair is heavy\".  They suggest that the chair is \"of the transitional period from the Gothic to Renaissance, the Gothic style being determined by the gables and finials, and the Italian influence shown by the back and back-rail\".  They date the chair 1525-30 but have been unsuccessful in tracing its history.\n\nRalph Edwards Response\nthat the armchair belongs to a type known as a \"box chair\" made on the continent and in England in the early years of the 16th century.  He questions whether this chair might not be a composite but expresses interest in purchasing it if it is original.\n\nMuirhead Reply\nrepeats their conviction that the chair is in its original form although the back leg has been restored and one or two other minor repairs carried out.  They point out interesting carvings of a hen's leg on the front leg and a hen's wing on the side of the chair.  They suggest a purchase price of \u00a3150 and offer to send the chair to the Museum for inspection.\n\nAfter sending the chair to the V & A, Muirhead\nreports that they have been in contact with the previous owner but \"all she can say is that it had come out of a store into which it was put from an old house\".\n\nIn requesting approval for purchase from the Director, Edwards states\n\"This is a box-chair of great quality and interest.  It is carved with a mixture of Gothic and Renaissance\u2026probably dates from about 1540-50 even allowing something for a 'time-lag' in Scotland.  I know of no close parallel among the few genuine chairs of this type and age\u2026..The chair is certainly genuine\u2026repairs are relatively slight\".\n\nn.b. the photographs of the chair from 1950 are in the R.P. file.",
