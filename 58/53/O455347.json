Indo-Tibetan boots have a distinctive separately-shaped stacked sole combined with an upper to which a wool cloth shaft is sewn.The toe shape, colour, embellishment and quality of materials of Indo-Tibetan boots often indicate rank and regional affiliation.\n\nThe colour, material and form of this pair of boots maybe understood in the context of the overall clothing articles of Tibetan monks, which often include a waistcoat, a red monk skirt, as well as their activities. When monks pray, they wear a red cloak made of wool, which is called dagang in Tibetan. After the monks are promoted to Gexi (the highest academic degree of Tibetan Buddhism), their waistcoats are rimmed with satin borders, and they hang satin water bags about their waists, in which is a small bottle for mouth-rinsing. Monks who are responsible for blowing suona horn and monastic bugle may also wear these things as ornaments.",
