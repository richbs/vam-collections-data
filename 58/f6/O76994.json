These were rooms decorated with prints that had been cut out and pasted directly onto the walls, and embellished with printed paper frames, swags and ribbons. In due course wallpapers were produced that emulated the effect of a print room. This paper comes from Doddington Hall, Lincolnshire, and was used in the fashionable redecoration of the house undertaken by Sir John Hussey Delaval around 1760. A blue-ground version of the same pattern also survives. Another fine 'print room' paper in the Museum\u2019s collection is E.474-1914.",
