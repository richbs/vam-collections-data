Khanh's real name was Nguyen Manh Khanh but he changed it to Quasar in his twenties to represent something 'more modern and universal'.  Inflatable furniture became popular during the 1960s as it provided a more affordable, novel and futuristic alternative to traditional forms.  At a time when youth culture was coming into focus designers seized the opportunity to design exclusively for the needs of the younger generation.  The flexibility offered by inflatable furniture, which could be blown up for guests and then deflated and stored once they had left, was as appealing as the exciting array of colours on offer.",
