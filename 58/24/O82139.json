London: The Stationery Office, 1997.\nFull citation, pp.301-302:\n\n\u201c<b>J L \n\n</b>The identity of the artist 'J L' has attracted considerable speculation. Long, who bought the following miniature for the Museum, must have wanted it because he recognised in the artist a very interesting hand, confident in deploying an unconventional colour range and in modelling characterful features with accuracy and power. His only surviving note, however, was to relate the artist to the scholar J L who translated Willem Goeree's <i>Inleydinge tot de algemeene Teyken-Konst</i> in 1678. (1) According to the British Library <i>Catalogue of Printed Books</i>, this scholar J L was Johann Lange, a physician of Hamburg, credited with an impressive bibliography that does not quite correspond, however, with that attributed to him by Long, (2) and with interests that relate generally to those of Goeree as well as to those of other physicians who turned their mind to limning (for example Turquet de Mayerne). (3) These considerations lend support to Long's identification of J L, but the hand in this case is so deft and 'practised' that it suggests a more committed interest in limning than that of a very productive natural philosopher. \n\nIn addition, the technique is conventionally English, apart from the gumminess which would be even more exceptional elsewhere in Europe. Accordingly, Jim Murrell suggested (4) that J L could have been John Lambert (d.1701), son of the Parliamentary General, who was said by the antiquarian Ralph Thoresby to be 'a most exact limner'. (5) Thoresby and Lambert were fellow members of the York 'Virtuosi', one of the provincial societies which grew up in the seventeenth century under the influence of Baconian natural philosophy, closely analogous to the Royal Society in London, and with a similar range of interests including the art and craft of painting. (6) Other artists within the York Virtuosi were Jacques Parmentier (1658-1730), William Lodge (1649-1689), Francis Place (1647-1728) and Henry Gyles (1645-1709), who owned the Norgate/Hoskins MS <i>Art of Limning</i>. (7) Lambert has been suggested as a possible author of the chalk and water-colour portrait of Gyles in the British Museum. (8) But no certain work by him survives, and the present miniature remains the solitary exemplar of the monogrammist J L. Technically there is no similarity between the miniature and the BM drawing. \n\n1 On Goeree, see Cross, Cat.
