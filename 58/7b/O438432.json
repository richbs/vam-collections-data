            "physical_description": "A rounded square-shaped writing box and lid with rounded corners and gently curved sides, formed by the <i>kanshitsu</i> technique, whereby a  layer of hemp soaked in lacquer and shaped over a form is allowed to dry before the next is applied, covered with <i>roiro</i> glossy black  lacquer. The outside of the lid and external sides of the base are decorated with scattered  plum blossoms of cracked shell of two different colours, one essentially white and the other essentially yellow, as well as red hemp, this last being a variation of the traditional <i>sumi-aka</i> (red corner) technique, whereby vermilion lacquer over hemp at a lower level to the main surface purposely shows through at the corners. Instead the artist, Okukubo, uses what she calls <i>fuchi-aka</i> and <i>akanuki</i>, the former referring to red-lacquered hemp on the edges of the object and the latter when it is part of the main decoration. The inside of the lid is decorated with stylised plum blossoms in gold <i>togidashi maki-e</i> lacquer on a gold-sprinkled lacquer ground. The box also contains a tray, inkstone tray, inkstone, waterdropper tray and waterdropper. The tray, with slightly outcurved sides, and inkstone tray fit into the box base, each comprising roughly half of its width, and similarly decorated with stylised plum blossoms in gold <i>togidashi maki-e</i> lacquer on a gold-sprinkled lacquer ground. The inkstone tray has a rectangular opening to hold the inkstone, as well as a smaller rounded rectangular opening to hold the waterdropper tray and waterdropper. The base of the trays and box consist of undecorated <i>roiro</i> lacquer.\n[Writing box] Writing box,  <i>kanshitsu</i> lacquer covered with <i>roiro</i> glossy  black  lacquer with four fabric circular pads on the base acting as feet.\n[Inkstone] An undecorated rectangular inkstone with rounded corners and an indented trough on the upper surface, with a further deeper indentation to one end.\n[Waterdropper] Waterdropper >fundame</i> gold lacquer on upper surface excluding top of the mouth and spout.\n[Storage box] Plain wooden box with inscription in ink and artist's signature and seal on the inside.",

            "public_access_description": "This traditional writing box (suzuribako) was made by the comtemporary lacquer artist, Kiyomi Okukubo. The two techniques with which she is particularly associated, kanshitsu (dry lacquer) and sumiaka (red corners), are both seen in this object. The rounded and squared box is made using the kanshitsu technique, whereby layer after layer of hemp are placed over a mould and soaked in lacquer and allowed to dry before the next is applied. \n\nSumiaka (red corner) is a traditional technique in which hemp covered in red lacquer is applied to the corners and edges of a box. In this way the texture and colour are clearly visible and contrast with the smooth black lacquer ground on the remainder of the box. In this writing box, Okukubo uses variants of this technique, which she calls fuchiaka and akanuki, whereby the red lacquer shows the base fabric texture and harmonises with maki-e (sprinkled picture) lacquer and cut mother-of-pearl shell raden on a lustrous ro-iro black lacquer. The term fuchiaka, which equates with sumiaka, describes the red lacquer fabric corners and edges of an object.  Akanuki, by contrast, is the term she uses for decorative elements in the main design which are cut into the black lacquer surface and reveal the red lacquer fabric. \n\nKiyomi Okukubo graduated from the Graduate School of Fine Arts at the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music in 1984, majoring in urushi lacquering. In 2003 she won the Gotoh Memorial Cultural Award for the most promising young talent which enabled her to travel to North America and Europe. In 2003 she was selected as a trainee of the Japanese Government Overseas Study Program for Artists and spent a year in London attached to the V&A. She regularly submits her works to various prestigious exhibitions, winning First Prize at events in 1985, 1986 and 1990.",
