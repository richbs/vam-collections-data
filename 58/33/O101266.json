Every day at noon water would have spouted from the mouths of the 12 zodiac animals shown as seated figures along the fountain. Sadly this magnificent European-style palace was razed to the ground during the Second Opium War in 1860. All that is left are some copperplate engravings, like this one, commanded by the Qianlong emperor when the palace was completed in the 1780s.\n \nIn the 18th century the vogue for 'chinoiserie' (or 'oriental style') swept Europe. No fashionable household was considered complete without one or two 'Chinese rooms' furnished with Chinese porcelain, Chinese silk hangings or wallpapers. \n\nIn far-away China the opposite was happening. The Qianlong emperor had dozens of European artists and scientists working at his court. He was fascinated by water fountains, mazes and European architecture. Under the direction of two Jesuit priests, Giuseppe Castiglione and Michel Benoist, a series of western-style buildings were constructed. The buildings were said to be full of rarities and novelties from Europe, including Beauvais tapestries sent by Louis XV of France.",
