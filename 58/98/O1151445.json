Banyans, or dressing gowns, however, worn only in private, were still made from decorative textiles. This banyan is a rare example of a printed Toile de Nantes, intended to be furnishing fabric, but here made up as a very masculine garment, cut to conform to the height of male fashion. The printed textile, depicting the army uniforms that influenced mainstream dress, looks back to popular military scenes of the Napoleonic Wars.\n \nWhile Jouy, in northern France, became most well known for producing plate-printed cottons, Nantes (in the west) was also an important centre for textile printing in France. Nothing is known of Jamet, the engraver, not even his first name, and only five toiles of his design are known to have survived.",
