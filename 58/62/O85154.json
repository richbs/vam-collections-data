ISBN 1851773088.\nThe Omega Workshops were founded in 1913 by the English critic, painter, and designer Roger Fry (1866-1934), with Vanessa Bell, also a painter and designer, as coordinator. A central figure of the legendary Bloomsbury Group, Vanessa Bell was married to critic Clive Bell, was Virginia Woolf's sister, and often collaborated on artworks with painter Duncan Grant. The Omega style was heavily influenced by developments in contemporary painting, especially French Fauvism and Cubism, and Omega designs often feature the brilliant colour of the former and the faceted abstraction of the latter. Omega produced six printed linens, each of which-in keeping with the painterly traditions the workshop emulated-self-consciously showed evidence of the artist's hand. These designs were used as dress fabrics by the most daring customers of the time. The unstructured, abstract patterns of the fabrics struck an unusually modernist note during the pre-World War I period when retrospection in design-especially the use of reproduction patterns-was favoured. Maud, presumably named after Lady Maud Cunard, a patron of Omega, was available in four different colourways.\nOmega textile production was limited, and surviving fabric examples are rare. When the workshops closed in 1920, the V&A acquired several Omega pieces, noting that \"they might become great curiosities in the future.\" This panel of Maud was acquired in 1966 by the Circulation Department as part of a large collection of copyright registrations transferred to the Museum from the Design Registry in Manchester. However, it was only in the 1980s, with a strong revival of interest in the Omega Workshops, that the \"great curiosities\" first acquired in 1920 assumed wider interest.\n\nLit.
