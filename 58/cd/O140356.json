The illustration is painted in gold, blue and black. The page is written on both sides, the sides being divided into two square compartments of red each enclosing a block of text on the side with text only, and one compartment on the front side with a smaller one to accommodate the illustration. A depiction of the early life of the Jina Mahavira, last of the twenty-four Jain tirthankaras or great spiritual teachers (believed to have died in 528 BC). Here the god Shakra (Indra) is conversing with three Devas in the council-hall Sudharman in his heaven. They are discussing the transfer of Mahavira's embryo from the Brahmani Devananda's womb to that of Trishala.",

Jainism is one of the oldest religions to have survived until the present time and its basic teaching is one of non-violence.  The Kalpasutra is divided into three sections.   The first section deals with the lives of the twenty-four Jinas or Tirthankaras, who were the Jain spiritual teachers or 'ford-makers'.  The second part deals with the life of Mahavira, the twenty-fourth Tirthankara.  The third part deals with rules for the ascetics and laws during the four months (chaturmas) of the rainy season, when ascetics temporarily abandon their wandering life and settle down amidst the laity. This is the time when the festival of Paryushan is celebrated and the Kalpasutra is traditionally recited.\nThe subjects of the pictures deal mainly with the early life of Mahavira.   Here the god Shakra (Indra) is conversing with three other gods (Devas) in the council-hall Sudharman in his heaven. They are discussing the transfer of Mahavira's embryo from the Brahmani Devananda's womb to that of Trishala, a Kshatriya woman who gave birth to him.",
