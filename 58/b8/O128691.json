            "history_note": "The tomb slab is made of Verona marble. It has the Malaspina arms of the Spino Fiorito line at the top, and an inscription that relates the death of Visconte Malaspina, the son of the Marchese Spinetta.  The lower line of the inscription is damaged and has been filled in. The upper right corner is also damaged. \n\nAccording to museum records the tomb slab was covering the top of the sarcophagus when it arrived in the museum. The inscription was described as \"partially covered by the superstructure,\" which could explain the damage sustained to the lower part of the inscription.  The damage obliterated a section of the inscription, and appears to have been filled in at a later date.\n\nHistorical significance: The inscription, as noted by Pope-Hennessy, reads that Visconte, the son of Marchese Spinetta died on 3 October 1362.  However, Pope-Hennessy remarked that Visconte was the name of Spinetta\u2019s brother, and the name did not appear among Spinetta\u2019s known illegitimate sons. (Pope-Hennessy, 369). \n\nDorini suggested that the epigraph might refer to one of Spinetta\u2019s illegitimate sons who died young, but also remarked that there were no other references to a son named Visconte aside from the V&A tomb slab. (Dorini, 353). He commented that the inscription was found near the monument of Spinetta, but did not provide an exact location. \n\nThe damage to the inscription has rendered proper transcription difficult. Dorini filled in the damaged section in his transcription with  \u201cQUINTADECIMA\u201d or \u201cfifteen\u201d but did not clarify his source.  He also did not state whether he was transcribing the actual inscription on the object, or if his source was a guidebook.\n\nPope-Hennessy did not fill in the missing letters, but only transcribed Q\u2026T\u2026CIMA and did not provide an explanation.  \n\nOrti Manara did not record this inscription in the church, which could indicate that it was already on top of the sarcophagus by 1842.  This location would provide an explanation for the condition of the letters and the shield with the Malaspina coat of arms. Aside from the lower line of the inscription, which is damaged, both are in very good condition. The shield and the carving of the eradicated thorns on it have sharply delineated edges compared to the softened edges seen on relief carving on tomb slabs that have remained in their original location.\n\nTomb slabs that were in heavily trafficked areas tend to have their inscriptions worn away over time. The good condition of the letters, as well as the lack of documentation regarding a son named Visconte might indicate that the inscription was added or modified at the time of sale in order to increase its value.",

            "historical_context_note": "Flat tomb slabs such as this one became popular in Europe at the beginnings of the 11th century. They were set into the floor of the nave or family chapel to serve as covers for the vault.  Freestanding tombs were restricted to those that held the remains of saints, until about the 1200s, when popes and royalty adopted the form for their use. \nTomb slabs were made from bronze, marble, or other stones, and often included an effigy along with an inscription.",
