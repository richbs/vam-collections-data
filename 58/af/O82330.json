The fashion for hair ornaments set in the back of miniature lockets developed in the late 18th century. The giving of tokens of hair was a long-established practice. When Queen Charlotte appointed Samuel Finney as her miniature painter in 1763, she sent him a lock of her hair. This, he wrote in his memoir, should be 'preserved by his family with the same care and reverence as a good catholick would the relicks of his patron Saint'. The back of a miniature provided a perfect setting for such tokens, but the fashion for hair ornaments grew to such an extent that they were sometimes merely decorative rather than sentimental. This is a highly ornate decoration, with flourishes of hair joined with swags of seed pearls, and the initials of sitter laid in seed pearls over a hair ground. It is not clear whether it is made with hair from the sitter or is an example of this fashion, which now seems rather odd.",
