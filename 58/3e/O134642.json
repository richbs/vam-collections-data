Containing two internal shelves on modern brackets nailed to the sides. The unfinished sides, top and bottom, and the overhanging bottom front rail suggest that this cupboard would have been set within a wall recess, so that the front were flush with the wall.\n\nConstruction\nThe front consists of an oak framework, with pegged mortise and tenon joints, with integral edge mouldings. The top and bottom rails have been reduced in height in the central section so as to receive the hinged door. The rails of this door are reduced in height so that when the door is closed and the rails of the door sit adjacent to the main rails, this 'combined' rail matches the dimension of the main rails but it lacks the scratch moulding that would help them be read as continuous with the static rails. The top and bottom and sides of the carcase are each formed by a single plank of oak or elm. The sides are nailed to the top and bottom. The joined front has been nailed onto the sides, top and bottom. The back is formed by 4 vertical butting (?) planks which are presumably nailed in place, and which may be replacements.\n\nOriginally, there must have been a marked contrast between the pale oak framework and the reddish spindles. \n\nModifications\nIn the left, upper front panel one spindle has been replaced, slotted in from behind.\nOn the left side (bottom), a section of wood is damaged and lifting.\nHung on modern mirror plates.",

Fixed to the wall, off the ground, the contents would have been protected from vermin and accidental knocks.\n\nVarious hanging methods were used, a nailed metal hanger or nailing directing through the back boards (sometimes extended for this purpose). Some, often with small drawers, were built into the internal walls, often in the chimney, and were intended for the dry storage of salt and spices. (Some were suspended from the ceiling on ropes and pulleys.)\n\nMural cupboards tend to be rather flimsily constructed, using thin nailed boards - perhaps to reduce weight, and often incorporate pierced or drilled panels (or turned spindles) that allow a partial view of the contents and ventilation. It has been suggested that such cupboards may have been constructed by box makers (Chinnery p.332).\n\nDrinking glasses were 'fairly plentiful even in lower middle class homes' in 16th and 17th century England (Chinnery), and were kept in a lightly-built, wall-mounted unit known as a glass case, glass perch or glass cupboard - with or without open-work doors\n\nSee Victor Chinnery, <i>Oak Furniture, The British Tradition</i> (Woodbridge, 1979), p.338 (fig.3:318) for a comparable example described as mid-seventeenth century, and pp.329-340 for a discussion of the type.",
