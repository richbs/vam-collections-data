The bronze of the feet and the hands and the face is left clear, the rest being covered with gilt lacquer having raised ornamentation set with pieces of coloured mirror glass.  The crown, which is separate, is made of cut sheet metal and wood similarly ornamented.  There are other decorative pieces made of sheet metal and ornamented in the same way attached to the front.  A characteristic of the treatment of the robes is the way the ends of folds are drawn to a point and curved upwards.  \nThis is identical with similar treatment of parts of the Burmese Shrine - IS 11-1969",
