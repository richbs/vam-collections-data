This type stems back at least to the 10th century; a very fine one of that period being the famous St. Andrew's foot reliquary in Trier commissioned by Archbishop Egbert (died 933).  This consists of a sandalled foot made of gold sheet over a wooden core, which stands on a casket containing the remains.  Reliquaries were also made in the form of hands, ribs, legs, arms and heads.  Those intended for fingers seem, however, to be rare and the inventories are short on them.  There is one illustrated in the Hallesche Heiltumsbuch.  A late-13th-century one in the convent of St. Walburg, Eichstatt, emerges from a traceried pediment and a 15th-century one, formerlly in the Rutschi Collection is realistically modelled, with a jewelled ring and emerging from a six-lobed foot with a stamped edge.",
