Most importantly of all, Oliver introduced a new concept to England: that drawing could be a dynamic, spontaneous activity, ideally suited to the jotting down of quick visual notes, rather than, as his master Hilliard had used it, a tool whose use was limited to the setting out of a composition\u2019s basic contours. However, although his lively drawings have the air of having been made directly from the life, they are mostly based on existing visual sources. This drawing in particular appears to be based on head studies by Leonardo da Vinci, although the influence is probably indirect and filtered through contemporary printmakers.",
