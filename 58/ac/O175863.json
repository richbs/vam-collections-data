The model stands to the extreme left, wearing a purple turban and drawing yarn from a ball of wool on a small tripod table standing beside her. The backdrop, which depicts Poiret's fitting-room, shows a neo-classical style settee with green upholstery standing on a blue dais, a blue and gold floor-cushion, and a free-standing lamp with a matching blue and gold shade. The walls feature Neoclassical motifs picked out in blue against white. Apart from the table, the room scene is contained within a red rectangular frame, as if the woman and the table are standing in front of a very large framed picture.\n\nPoiret was one of the most influential and notorious designers of the late 1900s/early 1910s. His gowns followed the natural line of a slim, uncorseted body, which is clearly shown in Lepape's illustration, although many women still had to resort to longline corsets to achieve the same effect. Compared to the elaborately detailed and constructed gowns produced by many fashion designers, Poiret's designs were audaciously simple and bold, and sometimes quite far-sighted. For example, his 'robe de minute', a gown made of two rectangles of fabric, was created in 1911, 10 years before near-identically constructed chemise dresses became widespread (see T.118-1975). Lepape's illustrations often showed Poiret's models' heads simply wrapped in turbans, in contrast to the elaborately arranged hairstyles that many fashionable women favoured. Decoration was kept to a minimum, with graphic impact favoured over fine detail. The scalloped white bands set at a diagonal against the rich wine colour of this dress are typical. Poiret's success was short-lived, as his influence did not last beyond the 1910s. Although he continued designing into the 1920s and created gowns for Liberty's in 1933, he failed to recapture the success and notoriety he had enjoyed in the 1910s.",
