In the centre of the white field is a large purple medallion with two pendants. The medallion contains a white 8-lobed rosette with blue and purple blossoms. This is surrounded by angular blossoms and palmettes. Similar flowers fill the white, red and blue field, decreasing in scale with the width of the band.\n\nMAIN BORDER: dark blue ground with a repeating pattern of a large, multi-petalled flower (white, light purple, light blue and red) above and below these are a pair of iris-like flowers. These are separated by pairs of rosettes - 2 white, 2 blue star-like and 2 red ones. The latter seem to come out of a white basket from which also comes a central rosette.\n\nINNER AND OUTER BORDERS: very light green ground with floral meander on black stem. This border has to one side a reciprocal trefoil in light blue and red and to the other a narrow band with red ground and a small floral meander.\n\nWARP: white cotton; 3 (Z4S)Z; 36-38 threads per inch (140 per dm); depressed.\n\nWEFT: blue cotton; Z4S; 2 shoots after each row of knots; 18-10 knots per inch (72-78 per dm).\n\nPILE: wool. 15 colours with marked abrash especially in the red and purple: red, orange, light orange, dark yellow, yellow, light green, very light green, dark blue, blue, light blue, very light blue, dark purple, purple, black, white; asymmetrical knot open to the left and tied around 2 warp threads; 342 knots to the sq. inch (4900 per sq. dm).\n\nSide finish: one cord oversewn with purple wool.\n\nEnd finish: Lower: one pass of yellow, blue, red weft wrapping and warp loops 5 cms long with weft chaining at the end of the loops. Very tightly twisted; there are one or two loose passes of blue cotton.  \nUpper: one pass of red, yellow and blue weft wrapping and then loose warp threads maximum 10 cms long.",
