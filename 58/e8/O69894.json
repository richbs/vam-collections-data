A crozier or cross-staff is held in his left hand. His right hand was presumably raised in blessing. A small female figure, doubtless representing the donor of the carving, kneels at bottom right, wearing gown and veil, looking left. From her hands, which are held together, a scroll rises in a curve. There are no specific characteristics by which the bishop may be identified, but the presence of the donor figure indicates that he was a saint.\n\nMany of the details of the main figure have been broken off, including the mitre, the top of the crozier or cross-staff and the right and left hands. There are two small holes right through the figure just above the bishop's left arm. The bishop's head has been broken off and replaced. Parts of the surfaces of the carving are weathered.\n\nSlight traces of red remain in the folds of the bishop's chasuble and gilding on his hair. The inscription on the scroll is missing. The back of the figure is marked. There are two lead-plugged holes. The bottom has been cut away.",

A standing figure of an archbishop with a kneeling donor was discovered in Wakefield, Yorkshire, in 1755--and presumably long since lost--which was identified as St. William of York from the inscription still readable on the scroll. There is also the Flawford standing St. Peter figure in the Castle Museum, Nottingham, which includes a kneeling donor.",
