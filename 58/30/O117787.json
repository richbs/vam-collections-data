The octagonal plank seat is carved centrally with a circular recess and is supported on a solid board support at front and back, joined by a shaped, rectangular-sectioned stretcher.  The front support is waisted in plan, the top corners round, the lower corners formed as feet by a recess cut between them. The edges of the front support are carved with bands of overlapping coin ornament between raised fillets, these bands scrolling together at the top on either side of a grotesque mask set against a rayed background.  The lower ends of the scrolling bands merge into acanthus ornament above abstracted animal feet, with further foliage decoration between.the feet. The back support is cut as a simple board, but with the outline echoing that of the front.  The back is fan-shaped, the carving on its front face creating the illusion of a T-shaped back support with a scrolled cresting above, all the front faces carved with formal motifs.  The outer edges of the back are carved with female term figures, terminating below in acanthus.  These are set diagonally with their heads at the outer edge of the chair rail and their scrolled lower ends resting on the narrow back edge of the seat.  The area between the terms and the central, vertical band of carving is carved with scrolling vine leaves.",

They have long been known as sgabelli, ultimately derived from the word scabellum (Latin for \u2018stool\u2019). In Venice they often stood in sets along the walls of the portego . This was a long room, bright with reflected natural light or candlelight that was used for family celebrations, display and hospitality. Here the chairs could be moved around, and seat-cushions added as occasion demanded. \n\nThis example belonged to Jules Soulages (1803\u20131856), a lawyer from Toulouse. His collection was exhibited at Marlborough House in London between December 1856 and January 1857, and subsequently purchased for this museum.",
