The style is parallel with that of No. 275, and this drawing may therefore also be dated  c.1824. \n\nNos. 256, 257, 259, 260, 261 and 262 all come from the same skecth-book, measuring approximately 181x262 mm. (about 7 1/8 x 10 1/4 ins.) and used by Constable both on his summer visit tyo Salisbury and Gilingham and his autum visit to Coleorton. The height of the pages tapers from 178mm. at the outer edge to 181 mm. at the hinge edge. Nos. 273 an 274, and possibly also Nos. 275-278, come from the same sketch-book, and show that he used it at Brighton, probably on his first visit in 1824; for their possible connection with a projected group of engravings, see also the note following No. 284.\n\n\nGraham Reynolds\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"",
