The subject may represent Shiva as the Lord of the Five Senses. However it may possibly represent Rama and Sita with four attendant girls. Along the top runs a fillet of temple domes and at the bottom is row of Hamsas. The carving on both sides is the same but reversed.",

The top register of the relief contains a row of temples while the bottom register has six hamsas or sacred geese. The carving on both sides is the same but reversed. The work is very fine in scale and detailed, with an openwork screen of foliage between the figures, and elements of tinting remain on the ivory. The original function of the panel is not certain. It has been suggested it may be from a comb but there is no trace of fittings for the teeth.",
