Action Man was originally produced and sold in the United Kingdom and Australia by Palitoy Ltd from 1966 until 1984. Action Man was relaunched in 1993 by Hasbro, which is the era that this particular Action Man falls under.\n\nAction figures are particularly popular with boys because they represent traditional masculine traits and are closely associated with the public sphere which is represented by items such as tools, transportation, garages, machines, and military equipment. The Action Man Sky Diver comes with a plastic gun and dressed in an extreme sports kit to reinforce these masculine traits.",
