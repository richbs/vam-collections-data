The Dolls' Festival is traditionally celebrated by girls on 3rd March. Bowls of this type were traditionally used to hold food, such as rice or soup. It would traditionally be placed on a kakeban tray. This set has a pair of kakeban trays, one for the male and one for the female doll. Each tray would also include matching bowls, which are part of this set.\nThe focal point of the Dolls' Festival festival is the display of dolls, miniature furniture and household accessories on tiered shelves in the home. The furniture and accessories are modelled on wedding sets which formed part of the dowry of elite women. Such sets, which usually included more than 50 objects, were intended as ceremonial showpieces to show off the family's wealth and status. They included bathing and toilet articles, items connected with clothes, writing implements and those for eating and drinking. This Dolls' Festival group consists of several incomplete sets of miniature lacquer furniture and daily utensils, to which this bowl belongs.",
