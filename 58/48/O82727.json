The sketch has the rather forced colours seen in such presumably late sketches as Nos. 373 and 374 [143-1888, 140-1888], in particular a greenish- yellow tone, and may reasonably be taken to have been painted in the last period of Constable's working life.\u201d\n<u>Vikutoria & Arub?to Bijutsukan-z? : eikoku romanshugi kaigaten = The Romantic tradition in British painting, 1800-1950 : masterpieces from the Victoria and Albert Museum / selected by Mark Evans</u> [Japan : Brain Trust], 2002. 185 p. : ill.
