            "physical_description": "Rectangular veneered wood strongbox with metal mounts, handles, twin floor-bolts and lock, containing two drawers and 5 concealed compartments.\n\nConstruction\nThe body of the box is of oak, the static front, back and sides apparently formed from boards grained side to side, which are joined at a mortise and long tenon joint. The bottom board appears to be a floating oak panel held in grooves in the static front, back and sides. The exterior parts (except the bottom) are veneered, the back apparently with oak, the other parts with a figured wood such as kingwood or walnut (0-7 - 1.5mm thick), but some graining may have been used to enhance these. Currently there is extensive darkening around the brass mounts (probably from brass polish).\n\nThe body of the box has one dust board (forming the floor of the main internal compartment) above two wide drawers, between which, in the form of a vertical divider is a removeable, concealed compartment, made of oak with a veneered front. Cut into the static front board are two openings in each of which is concealed a removeable compartment. These are concealed behind a removeable dovetail-shape (one veneered oak, one replacement in solid hardwood).\n\nThe lid is presumed to be in the form of a joined frame, faced (inside and out) with a board [but this needs careful checking], leaving an interior space. The underside of the lid is fitted with a hinged, bolted flap which opens on an aperture, presumably for papers. On either side of this aperture is a removeable section of mitred moulding which conceals a plain oak compartment that slides into the body of the lid, and that is fitted with a silk pull held on an iron nail.\n\nThe two drawers are of oak, grained, with a veneered front, and with a single silk pull held by a peg. They are dovetailed at the front (and apparently at the back with one large dovetail though this is difficult to see), with the bottom board (grained front to back) glued into rebates in the sides and back. One appears to have been restored.\n\nThe secret compartments are of glued, butted oak (about 2mm thick), plain except for any show surfaces which are veneered; some have sliding lids.\n\nThe hinged fall-front appears to be an oak board which sits within two 'stile battens' applied to the static front. It is held closed by an internal sliding, brass bolt.\n\nMetalwork\nThe exterior of the box is mounted with 4 types of brassy mount: \nalong the arris edges are lengths of right-angle with trefoil leaves held with metal pins;\nlarge, openwork mounts attached to the hinges of the fall-front, the lid and two static mounts on each side (which terminate in plain bands on the non-show surfaces); fixed with metal pins in the openwork, and in the wider parts with internal bolts and external flower-heads;\ntwo cast brass(?) carrying handles, one on each side, held on split-end straps secured internally with metal pins;\na shaped lockplate (with both solid and openwork), to which is fitted a similar hasp which runs into the middle hinge to the lid; the fitting of the lockplate has required the trimming of the edge mounts at the bottom;\n\nIn each side panel a long vertical floor-bolt is fitted in the centre, which would have operated with a T-bar (missing).",
