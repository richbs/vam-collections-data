Godwin's watercolour design for the cabinet is in his sketchbooks for the years 1870 to 1876, in the V&A's collection. It belonged to Godwin himself, and later to his son Edward Gordon Craig, from whose estate it was purchased by the Museum.\n\nKnown as the \u201cMonkey Cabinet\u201d, owing to its ivory handles which are in the form of monkeys, the cabinet is typical of the Anglo-Japanese style associated with Godwin\u2019s designs.  He often incorporated real Japanese artefacts into his work, shopping regularly in the 1870s at Liberty\u2019s East Indian Art Warehouse on Regent Street, which stocked such items.  This is possibly where the Japanese carved boxwood  panels on the cabinet doors and the Japanese ivory handles came from.  The handles are actually netsuke, a sort of Japanese dress ornament used as a weight to prevent purses worn over the belt from slipping off, that have been adapted.",
