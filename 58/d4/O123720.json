            "public_access_description": "Oliver Messel (1904-1978) was Britain's leading theatre designer throughout the 1930s, '40s and '50s, mastering every aspect of entertainment - ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue - as well as working in interior decoration and textile design. His lavish, painterly and romantic concepts were perfectly in tune with the times and earned him an international reputation.  By 1960, however, that style was becoming unfashionable, and Messel gradually abandoned theatre and built a new career designing luxury homes in the Caribbean. \n\nRichard Strauss's Ariadne auf Naxos, with libretto by Hugo von Hofsmannsthal, was originally a one-act opera, written to follow performances of Moli\u00e8re\u2019s 1670 comic play Le Bourgeois gentilhomme and first staged in 1912. The difficulties of presenting such a lengthy evening\u2019s entertainment, which required both an acting company and an opera company, led Strauss to revise the work in 1916 so that it could be staged without the play. Glyndebourne Festival Opera presented the original 1912 opera preceded by a shortened version of Le Bourgeoise gentilhomme at the 1950 Edinburgh Festival, with sets and costumes by Oliver Messel. In 1953 the 1916 version was staged at Glyndebourne with new designs by Messel and these designs were used in revivals throughout the 1950s. In 1962 Glyndebourne restaged its Edinburgh Festival production with an acting company from the Old Vic and reverted to Messel\u2019s 1950 designs.\n\nThe opera concerns a wealthy businessman who hosts an entertainment consisting of a serious opera based on the Greek myth of Ariadne and Bacchus, combined with a comic harlequinade. Bacchus, the Greek god of wine, falls in love with Ariadne, who has been abandoned by her lover Theseus on the island of Naxos.  Messel dressed Bacchus in an 18th century gentleman\u2019s costume, but his accessories are the traditional attributes of Bacchus: a vine garland and a thyrsus, a spear tipped with vine leaves.",
