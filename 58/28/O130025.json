This evocative image captures the serenity of the Buddha figure in what is probably a simple roadside shrine. There are numerous tazoungs like this in the Burmese countryside.\n\nLinneaus Tripe created one of earliest photographic records of Burma (Myanmar). His reputation as a photographer developed in India where he was employed in the East India Company army. Appointed to accompany the first British diplomatic mission to Burma in 1855, he was instructed to record information about the country. Tripe took over 100 images, demonstrating his skill in observation and composition. He used calotypes or paper negatives, which gave the prints a \u2018soft-focus\u2019 look.",

            "history_note": "This photograph was one of a series from 'Burma Views' which was presented to the V&A in July 1909 by Lady Ida Low, wife of Malcolm Low, Esq., of the Bengal Civil Service and daughter-in-law of General Sri John Low. As a member of the Council of India in 1857, Sir John Low received the Burma Views (1857) set on 15th April 1857.\nSee Registry files for papers on acceptance of gift.\nSee Dewan p.244 for listings of other copies of the same photograph elsewhere.\n\nThis photograph was published in the album <u>Burma Views</u> 1857, by Captain L. Tripe, official photographer to the Government of India's Mission to Ava [Burma]. Tripe made over 200 photographs during this trip, and the captions to the images are thought to be a collaboration between Tripe and the secretary to the Mission to Ava, Henry Yule.\n\nTripe\u2019s Burma Views were distributed widely and were very well received. Tripe sent 50 copies to Calcutta. Fourteen sets from these were distributed by the Government of India, including seven sets to members of the Mission to Ava, former capital of Burma. Twenty sets were ordered by the East India Company\u2019s Court of Directors, and most were given to members of the Court. It is not known what happened to the remaining sixteen sets.  Due to Tripe\u2019s ownership of the negatives, he printed a selection of his photographs for further distribution. A set of 92 views of Burma was given to the King of Prussia, and more sets were given to the Madras Photographic Society and associated figures. Two hundred and ninety additional prints were offered for sale at 2 Rupees per print at Griffiths and Co., Madras.\n\nHistorical significance: After his series of Burma photographs made in 1855, Tripe went on to become Government Photographer for the Madras government. He produced significant works that function as both records and works of art. These are some of the earliest record photographs of Burma.\n\nIt was hard work to produce photographs in the 1850s, particularly in the heat of India. Tripe was under pressure to produce them quickly, and evidently would have preferred more time and better working conditions. He wrote an accompanying disclaimer for the albums:\n\u2018The accompanying Views\u2026in justice to him as a Photographer employed by the Government of India, should not be looked upon as a challenge to Photographic criticism; but as a series of views of subjects interesting on account of their novelty\u2026As excuses too, for these defective photographs he would wish it known, that he was working against time; and frequently with no opportunities of replacing poor proofs by better. Also that, from unfavourable weather, sickness, and the circumstances unavoidably attending such a mission, and actual working time was narrowed to thirty six [sic] days\u2019 (This note is photographed in Dewan, p.211).",

            "production_note": "Edition number unknown. This print was probably made to go into the album 'Burma Views', of which 50 full sets were produced. Additional prints were produced by Tripe for different sets of Burma images.", 
            "historical_context_note": "In April 1855 Lord Dalhousie, governor general of India, advised on a political trip to Amerapoora, Burma following the annexation of Pengu (part of Burma) by the British after the 1852 Anglo-Burmese war. Tripe was sent to accompany the party in 1855 as official photographer. The photographs he made during his stay resulted in his album of 122 images, <u>Burma Views</u>, published in 1857. These photographs result from this project, and have Tripe\u2019s original numbering and titles on their mounts.",
