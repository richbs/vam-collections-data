            "physical_description": "Vase. Bronze, four-sided, with wide mouth, two handles formed by the head & tongue of monsters, chased with panels of pet ornament of scrolls.\nResearch by Maria Fabrizi \u2013 FEB. 1988: This vase is probably Japanese (R.K.). It has an inset base, and this was probably soldered in as an area around its edge is silvery in colour. At some stage, this had been painted, and this area fluoresces under UV light. The base square has rather porous metal, which is somewhat abrade and is pinkish-brown in colour. There is a small soldered repair in the base square. A small fluorescent area on the base exterior seems to be the remnants of a label. The handles may have been made separately, but this is uncertain. However, no rivets are apparent. The handles are set in the centres of the panels, and are not on obvious seam lines. The vase has a flared rim.\nMuch of the body is smooth, with a shiny brown exterior. This has some pinkish-red patches, and some abraded areas. The body has small voids, suggesting porosity in the casting. The decoration consists of one panel on each of the four faces, in the narrowest region near the handles. It seems to be cast-in. Te vase is poorly finished inside the handles. The interior of the vase shows some finishing in places, but the remnants of a casting flash are still visible.\nAnalyses of three parts of the vase were carried out, using non-intrusive EDXRF methods. The base plate, one handle, and a plain area of the body were all chosen. The results were similar for all the parts. The metal consisted of copper with lead, and less than 5% of the alloying components tin and zinc. The level of zinc was so low that it might not be a deliberate addition, but merely a natural impurity. The lead content was sufficient to improve the fluidity of the molten metal, and was at a higher concentration than would be expected by accident. The copper figure is slightly higher in the base plate, but this should have been made separately, so there is no reason to expect the metal to be absolutely identical with that of the vase body. The pinkish-brown colour observed would be consistent with copper containing low concentrations of alloying components.",
