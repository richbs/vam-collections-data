The first teddy bear was made in the United States by a company called Ideal, although they became popular all over the world very quickly. French bears can usually be identified by their short mohair and their simple jointing on the outside of their bodies though it is difficult to tell which company made them because many are not labelled. Traits from 1950s French manufactured bears can be seen in this example by its large cupped ears, distinctive downturned mouth, short limbs and fabric nose. Two major manufacturers in France were M Pintel Fils and F adap, though they both finished production in the 1970s.",
