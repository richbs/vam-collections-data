            "public_access_description": "Woodrow is one of Britain's best known contemporary artists who practices in a variety of media.  He is well  known for his sculptural installations made from waste goods, such as discarded cars and refrigerators. His interest in the fallout of a consumer-driven world can be seen in this piece, commissioned by the South London-based fabric printing studio, The London Printworks Trust, for an exhibition which addressed global migrations, the status of the refugee, and homelessness. \n\nWoodrow's piece for this commission was a kitchen table over which was thrown a large cloth printed with images of Rwandan refugees fleeing the genocide of 1994. Beneath the table he scattered cushions. The covers of these cushions were printed with images photographed at newsstands and consist of a 'collage' of expensive 'life style' magazines, which convey an underlying message of domestic fantasy. Woodrow invites his audience, like innocent as children playing house under a table, to snuggle down and dream a life of comfort and security. He suggests that such a life can only ever be a dream for many of us, but especially so for those who are homeless and for refugees.",
