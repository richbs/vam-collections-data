Over the past ten years he has won several prizes including the Best New Merchandise at Goldsmiths' Fair, 2004, the Evening Standard Award for the Best Domestic Product at Chelsea Crafts Fair, 2002, a commendation in 1999 by the Goldsmiths' Company and second prize for enamelling from the Goldsmiths' Company in 1998.  Since 2002, he has regularly and frequently exhibited throughout Britain, Germany, Spain, Finland and South Korea.  His reputation as an innovative and skilful, innovative silversmith and enameller is already well established.\n\nBecause of his impressive reputation, the Museum has commissioned with funds and advice provided by Oliver Makower, a pair of bowls which show a new departure in Bohm's experimentation with coloured, opaque enamel.  At the same time, the forms ultimately derive from the historic architecture of his home city, Split on the Adriatic coast.",

I try to use simple techniques imaginatively in order to push my chosen medium further and to compose visually the sense of intimacy.  My attention is to \"arrest\" the process of making an actual piece.  This reflects my perception of creativity as the human way of negotiating the constantly evolving world in which we live.  \n\nCreative thinking links to the past and future and changes constantly and subtly, affecting and transforming our feelings of continuity of place and time.  In this sense I am particularly interested in the ways we root our personal identities in landscape, architecture and history.  This interest has aesthetic consequences, of course, but it runs deeper than that.  I am not moved by the traces of days gone by only in terms of visual inspiration.  I am also driven by the principles they uncover, as i try to use an abstracted artistic language of these fragments to unhinge and disconcert the preconceived notions of what an everyday object is all about.",
