The word 'caddy' itself was adopted towards the end of the 18th century and seems to be a corruption of the Malay word for a measure of weight (kati) equivalent to about half a kilogram. Prior to this, caddies were more commonly called 'canisters'.\n\nTea caddies were usually made in sets of two or three to contain the two main types of tea: bohea (black) and green. Sometimes a larger caddy for sugar was added. The tea caddies were often engraved with an initial B or G to distinguish them and fitted in a wooden, lockable case (indicative of the price of tea at that time), which was sometimes covered in leather or shagreen.\n\nPeople\nJohn Farnell, the maker of this tea canister, was apprenticed in London in 1706 and entered his mark as an 'at large' worker in 1714.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThis example, a simple, faceted octagonal form with a moulded base and domed cap with little surface embellishment, is typical of early-18th-century canisters. By the 1750s a range of shapes and ornament appear, as canisters become the vehicle for extravagant Rococo embellishment. The slip-on cap doubled up as a measure, but they began to be replaced by hinged lids by about 1720.",
