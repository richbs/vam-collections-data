            "bibliography": "Takemura, Akihiko. <u>Fukusa: Japanese gift covers</u>. Tokyo: Iwasaki Bijutsu-sha, 1991, Plate 105. ISBN 475341325X\nOn this indigo blue satin fukusa are small birds and a nandina, sacred bamboo, laden with snow. This fukusa has no lining. The contrasting red berries and snow have a festive and congratulatory meaning. The small birds offer an invitation to spring, the right one with its beak open symbolising \"A\" and the one on the left with its beak closed symbolising the sound \"un\". \"A\" and \"un\" in combination make up \"A' un\" an old Sanskrit incantation. The ideograms for \"a\" and \"un\" are the source of letters, sounds or words diametrically opposed to one another, for example; yes and no, good and bad, inside and outside, glory and death, good and ill luck, etc. In Japanese \"Breath of A' un\" is a common expression which means understanding the whole story without using words yet conveying empathy or mutual understanding. \n\nNandina, Nandina domestica, is a small evergreen of Chinese origin whose fruit ripens to a bright red in late autumn through the winter. The dried fruit is used as cough medicine, for asthma or whooping cough. The trunk of this tree is a beautiful yellow colour and is highly regarded as a pillar for a tokonoma. When red rice is served in a <i>jubako</i>, stacked boxes, on festive occasions, sesame salt and nandin are used together as a garnish called <i>nan-o-tenjiru</i>, literally turning away difficulty. This is the name of the nandina, <i>nan-ten</i>. The teaching of turning away difficulty is also found in the Nio-sutra, which tells us of \"Seven misfortunes turned into seven fortunes.\"\n\nThis fukusa thus signifies \"prayer turning misfortune into fortune.\" It is used for gifts related to purification.* Besides being used as a gift covering for events involving purification, this fukusa is used also for gifts for the birth of a child or for sickness, in disasters such as fire, earthquake or flood with the symbolic meaning of \"turning disaster into happiness.\"\n\nAccording to the theory of the Five Elements and the Yin and Yang principle, the red nandina berries represent the element fire. In Japanese, \"laden with snow\" is pronounced <i>yuki-mochi</i>, and is reminiscent of a white, round and firm fits the description of the metal element. The nandian tree is a wood element and can produce fire, but it is capable of being destroyed by metal, the axe. Since the fire element can destroy the metal element, the red of the nandina berries is considered a fire element to weaken the metal element and, in turn, to strength the wood element or spring energy. Therefore, the nandina berries on this fukusa express a silent magic prayer for spring.\n\nA gift covered with this fukusa would have the sentiment of: \"Although you are in the midst of a crisis, take heart and be steadfast, for spring is not far behind.\"\n\n*Now it is commonly believed that dangerous times in life for men are the age of 25 and 42 for men, and 19 and 33 years old for women. Even today people go to shrines for purification or purging of evil spirits.",
