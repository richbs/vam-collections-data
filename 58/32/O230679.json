They were often embroidered, sometimes by family members or even by the future bride. A hand-written paper label sewn into this waistcoat links it to the marriage of John Montefiore and Julia Norman on the 28th January 1845. We have the white and silver figured silk waistcoat that John wore for the ceremony (see T.668-1919), so perhaps this waistcoat was embroidered by Julia as a wedding gift for her new husband.\n\nThe choice of forget-me-nots, which signify fidelity, would have been appropriate for a wedding waistcoat. John and Julia Montefiore's marriage lasted 50 years, ending only with their deaths in 1895.",

There is also another even larger embroidered waistcoat (T.670-1919).\n\nThe waistcoats were given to the V&A in 1919 by the Misses Montefiore in accordance with the wishes of his son (unclear whether he was their father or brother), also called John Montefiore (1851-1916)",
