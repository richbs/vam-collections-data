He revived the play for a Benefit performance on 10th (mat) December 1880, and took it into the Lyceum repertory on 26th December 1881.\n\nLetter from John Wyse to Alan Trotter, 5th October 1939:\n\"It belonged to Irving, and was worn by him as Digby Grant, but never afterwards.  Before that it had seen a good deal of service in his struggling days.  It came into my hands when Tom Heslewood's collecting of the Irving wardrobe was broken up and handed to Museums' (sic) and so forth.\"\n\nThe waistcoat was given to the BTMA by Austin Trevor on behalf of Alan Trotter.",
