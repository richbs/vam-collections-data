After an extensive national tour, the production opened at the Old Vic in  London on September 13th 2000.  The production was directed by Matthew Bourne, and the music by Terry Davies and Rodion Shchedrin was based on the score for the opera \"Carmen\" by Georges Bizet.  The production was lit by Chris Davies, and the associate directors were Scott Ambler and Etta Murfit.  This popular production was also recorded for television by Channel 4; and commercially released on video and dvd.",
