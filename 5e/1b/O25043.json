The back is only partially finished, and has one casting flaw.  The figure is broken below the knees where appendages pinned to the legs attest to an early, not altogether successful repair.\nThe face is full with its thick lips and heavy-lidded eyes; the hair gathered into a high chignon with a few locks falling onto the shoulders.  The depiction of the garment has been reduced to a few etched lines on the thigh, midriff and the left arm",
