He was bought his first camera by his mother at an auction when he was nine years old and by the age of eighteen he was working as a freelance photographer. His photographs include a personal record of community life in Camden where he grew up. During a period in which the Metropolitan Police faced accusations of racial prejudice, Normski documented a black member of the profession. \n\nThe V&amp;A acquired seven photographs by Normski as part of the Staying Power project. Staying Power is a five year partnership between the V&amp;A and Black Cultural Archives. The project aims to explore black British experience from the 1950s to the 1990s through photographs acquired by the V&amp;A and oral histories conducted by Black Cultural Archives.",
