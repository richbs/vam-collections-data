            "public_access_description": "This martini shaker forms part of the \"Martini\" travelling cocktail set commissioned by Wallpaper magazine for an exhibition, \"Wallpaper Handmade\", held in the Brioni House over three days during the Salon del Mobile trade fair, Milan, April, 2010. Miranda Watkins has created a sleek, travelling cocktail set, hand produced in Britain by A.R. Wentworth of Sheffield.\n\nThe set combines two traditional materials, pewter and cork, in a very contemporary idiom. The sheer simplicity of the design, with its clean lines and gentle curves, achieves a modern yet classic feel, while conveying the beauty of pewter.\n\n\"Martini\" is Miranda Watkin's second successful collaboration with A.R. Wentworth, following on from the Gleam Pewter Collection of tableware., which won the Eureka Design Award in 2008.\n\nMiranda Watkins creates contemporary objects for modern interiors, from intimate domestic settings to large scale public spaces. Based in London, Miranda Watkins works with clients world wide, supplying a diverse range of projects, from site specific artworks to mass manufactured designs for global brands. Her collection comprises kinetic mobiles, light installations, furniture, tabletop products and jewellery. Her work can be found in a number of important institutional collections, including the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Royal Institute of British Architects.",
