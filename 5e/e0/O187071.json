The field is divided by a lobed arch patterned with a double meander, a round flower and a cluster of 3 leaves. The spandrels contain flowers on curving stems and an inscription embroidered on the diagonal.  Towards the top of the arch is an octagonal panel with an inscription [for the Mohr tablet?]; below this is a bowl shape, also enclosing an inscription.  At the base of the arch is a vase with lots of flowers which sweep down to fill the lower corners and curve up and around the bowl and octagonal panel.  All the motifs are worked in outline only.  The flowers include a central group of irises, rosebuds [towards the base of the vase] and daffodils.\n\nNot able to determine the twist of the silk used in the ground; cream coloured.\nEmbroidery Thread: cream silk; floss [untwisted]\nBlack ink underdrawing is visible.",
