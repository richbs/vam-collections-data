In 1971 his work was shown at the Electrum Gallery, London, alongside that of German jewellery makers Claus Bury and Gerd Rothmann. All three broke with convention by combining a non-precious material, such as acrylic, with gold. Maierhofer then went on to experiment with an even wider range of materials, including tin and Corian. \n\nThese brooches belong to a series which were mainly round in shape and made of white pickled silver with fine inlays in yellow gold and white gold often blackened through oxidisation after annealing. The fine and beautifully balanced geometric lines give a three-dimensional feel, and also echo Op-Art. These pieces were made when Maierhofer had moved to the countryside leaving the bustle of urban Vienna behind him. They are a reflection of a time in his life when, as he once stated, he was in harmony with his work.",
