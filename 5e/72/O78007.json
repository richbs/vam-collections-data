            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nSmall cheap earthenware teapots were made by many Staffordshire potteries in the mid-18th century. They were often globular, with an applied crabstock (branch-shaped) handle and spout, and decorated in some simple technique to make them more attractive.\n\nMaterials & Making\nUntil the 1760s, when cream-coloured earthenware was perfected by Josiah Wedgwood (1730-1795), the plain lead-glazed earthenwares produced by Staffordshire potters required some form of decoration to enliven the rather drab material. For teapots, every possible permutation was attempted: tortoiseshell decoration, white body with dark applied decoration, black body with applied and gilded decoration, black body with white decoration, and (as here) orange body with white decoration roughly painted with oxide colours. Matching cream jugs, sugar bowls and cups and saucers were also produced.\n\nRetailers & Trading\nSuch teapots were commonly available in the so-called 'Staffordshire Warehouses' in most major towns in Britain, to supply a fast-growing number of tea drinkers with social pretensions but little money. The cost of a Staffordshire teapot in the mid-18th century was generally about one shilling.",
