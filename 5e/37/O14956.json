            "bibliography": "<u>100 Great Paintings in The Victoria & Albert Museum.</u> London: V&A, 1985, p.188\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"Percey Wyndham Lewis 1882-1957 \n<i>British School</i> \nAT THE SEASIDE 1913 \nPen and ink water-colour, 46.5 X 31.5 cm \nE.3763-1919. <i>Gift of Captain Lionel Guy Baker.</i> \n\nIn 1909 Wyndham Lewis returned from nearly eight years of travel and study having visited major cultural centres in Spain, Germany and France. No works of Lewis' exist from this period and it is the years from 1909 up to the First World War that are considered a time of experiment and development of his mature Vorticist style. \n\nBroadly speaking, Vorticism is an English hybrid of both the Futurist and Cubist movements. From Futurism it embraces the glorification of the machine age, the search for a universal dynamism through figures in motion and an aggressive iconoclasm against tradition aesthetics. From Cubism the Vorticists adopted the analysis of three-dimensional forms and their inter-relationship with the two-dimensional reality of the picture plane. Ultimately this led to the fracturing and faceting of the subject to present an almost abstract effect. \n\n<i>At the Seaside</i> falls into this formative and eclectic pre-war period, showing a curious mixture of styles. The only obvious link between the subject matter and the title is in Lewis' use of colour. The subtle tones of blue, aquamarine and grey with touches of sandy yellow in the highlight areas of the machine figure (at lower left) enhance the nautical theme. The three figures appear totally unconnected with each other although they are forced together in a loose pyramidal composition. The Futurist figure leads the eye across the picture plane in a strong rightward movement, while the background in bold strokes of blue and grey sweeps in the contrary direction. This represents one of the tensions within the water-colour. The bowler-hatted man is highly representational compared to his Futurist counterpart. He is attired in contemporary dress, but already there is a sculptural faceting to his form; his face can be read both straight on and as two profiles facing each other. It is as if he is poised on the threshold of metamorphosis. The rigid mask-like woman is dwarfed by these two more powerful figures and yet she recalls Picasso's studies with African masks. The lower part of her body has been overlaid with another piece of paper, producing a collage type effect and enhancing the experimental nature of the piece.\n \nLewis seems to be working out the case for both representation and abstraction at the same time in <i>At the Seaside</i>. Clive Bell, when reviewing Lewis's work in 1913 commented on this conflict. He said Lewis 'is inclined to modify his forms in the interest of drama and psychology to the detriment of pure design.' \n\nAlex Noble\"\n<u>Wyndham Lewis (1882-1957)</u> Madrid: Fundacion Juan March, 2010.
