He creates precise geometric shapes using a mixture of traditional techniques and modern machine tools. The combination of British and tropical hardwoods in this piece is typical of his work.\n\nNine Men's Morris is a game for two players, each of whom has nine pieces. The aim is to get three of your pieces in a row; this is called a Mill. The players take turns to lay their pieces on the board. Once all of the pieces are laid, the players take turns to move them by sliding them across the board to an adjacent position. When one player forms a Mill, they can remove one of the other player's pieces. You win when your opponent has only two pieces left, or is unable to move. The game has ancient origins, and was particularly popular in medieval England.",

The players take turns to lay the pieces on the board. Pieces are laid on the corners and junctions. When all the pieces are laid the players take turns to slide a piece of their colour along a line to an adjacent empty corner or junction. A line of three pieces of the same colour is called a Mill. A player forming a Mill removes one of the other player's pieces. A removed piece is not used again. A player wins when the other player has only two pieces left or is unable to move. \nIt was often played in taverns, since it was a game that was fun yet required very little thought.",
