Across the left lower edge, from the back opening, up the body to the proper right of the shield, over the shoulder and across the back neck to the left shoulder at the fastening are four rows of bold gold metal Russia braid, edged at the outside with a line of the heavy gold metal cord, finishing in a coil at the left shoulder; similar lines run up the left side of the back opening, around the left neck to meet the other lines at the point of the shield panel.  The body and arm panels are lined with black satin and the sleeves with cotton twill; around the lower edge are hand-worked bars.

The decorated shield-shaped panel and the rows of bold braid and cords hint at a military tunic, but adapted for a romantic and princely character.  Today, the prince traditionally wears black, partly as an indication of his mood, but also to match the ballerina, who wears a black tutu, when they perform the famous Black Swan pas de deux.  \nBallet costumes have to be extremely well made to withstand the pressure of dancing - a combination of extreme movement and sweat generated by the dancing and the stage lights.  The maker has used large, extremely strong press studs and hooks and bars to ensure that the costume does not come open at the back - no zip fastener could withstand the stress of the movement.",
