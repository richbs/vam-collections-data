A fan was an essential accessory in the formal dress of a wealthy woman. Although its original function was to cool the face, the fan soon became an important tool in non-verbal communication. The manner in which a lady held and moved her fan conveyed her feelings toward those around her. This folding fan opens to reveal scenes and decoration in both classical and \u2018chinoiserie\u2019 styles (this mimicked Chinese decorative art and was popular in the eighteenth century.) The front of the fan shows a classical female figure in a landscape composing at a lyre. She could be a Muse, perhaps Terpsichore the goddess of dance and song, often depicted with a lyre. She is accompanied by Cupid, who leans on her shoulder. The artist has positioned this scene within a cartouche of painted lace and peacock feather motifs. The holder of this fan would have been entertained by the Chinese scenes on the reverse. These show a young woman eloping with her lover, and women playing instruments, and choosing ribbons and silks for their toilette. The themes of elopement and the toilette were popular in French art of the time, and were painted by artists such as Fragonard and Boucher. Here these themes are painted in the Chinese style.",
