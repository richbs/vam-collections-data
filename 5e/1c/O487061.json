            "physical_description": "The carved red lacquer made under the auspices of the Chinese Emperor Qian Long (1736-1795) is well represented by a pair of covered gift-boxes and a small cabinet which were recived as bequset from the late lady (Charles) Tomes. The boxes are of a well known depraessed-globular shape frequently used in China as a container for New Year and other gifts, but ususally returned to the donor after the gift had been presented. They are decorated in relief with the five-clawed (Imperial) dragon among cloud scrolls, a representation of the spirit of rain and so a vehicle of good wishes. The inside of each cover is incised and gilt with the inscription 'Qian Long Bao He'. This means 'Nine dragons precious box' and probably alludes both to the subject of the decoration and to the Buddhist-Taoist conception of the Nine-Heavens Thunder Lord. The Qianlong reign-mark is incised and gilt under the bases. The bowls were plundered from the Summer Palace, Beijing, on 8th Oct, 1860 by Thos. Adkins, a member of the special mission which went to China with the Earl of Elgin, and are no doubt a product of the State Lacquer Works at Beijing.",
