They were musical clowns and adept jugglers, performing juggling feats with a variety of objects, including conical hats and a plum pie 'canon ball'. The Huline Brothers were also excellent at mime or 'dumbshow' and were well known for performing 'The Broken Mirror' act, the act in which one stands within a picture frame and mirrors the action of the other, afraid to admit he has broken the mirror.\n\nComedy musical double acts were popular in late 19th century circus and variety, performed by clown duos in white-face make-up such as the Hulines and the Musical Webbs. Musical clowns were expert musicians who played a range of instruments while making comical mistakes and funny noises. The Hulines' instruments included the violin, the concertina, the banjo and hand bells. They were English, but became well known on the continent during the 1870s, and were on the bill at the Folies Berg\u00e8res in Paris in 1888.",
