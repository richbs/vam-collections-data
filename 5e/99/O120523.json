The table stands on 4 carved legs joined by an X-shape stretcher.\n\nThe main frame consists of two carved side pieces (each one a deep rail morticed-and-tenoned to two carved legs. These side pieces are joined by an X-shape lapped stretcher at low level, and two lateral rails below the drawer, one front and one back, secured by loose tenons. The plank lid slides on two battens which are cut with a groove that fits over a lip on the compartment beneath. (In 2007 and 2010 the lid was jammed shut.) The main compartment is dovetailed, probably with a nailed, plank bottom which is in turn probably nailed to the main frame. The drawer is supported on each side by a batten nailed to the top of the side, which runs in a groove cut into each side piece. The drawer bottom consistss of lateral boards nailed up.",
