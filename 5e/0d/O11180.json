Dating to before 1855, it would have been worn by a fashionable Burmese woman on festive occasions. She would have worn it overlapping slightly in the front, revealing a portion of her leg as she walked. It would have formed an ensemble, with a fitted jacket, open in front, known as an ein-gyi, under which she would have worn a \nyinzi (breast cloth). Typical of hta-mein, the central area is the focus of decorative interest and displays the unique '100 shuttles' interlocking tapestry weave known in Burmese as acheik-luntaya in lime, navy, yellow and white on a coral background. From this flows a striped coral train--the graceful management of which would have been an acquired skill.",
