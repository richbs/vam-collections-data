The panel is unusual because it hasn\u2019t been placed within a new frame \u2013 instead the edges of the original marquetry framework are visible. These edges show the marquetry frame which the plaques slotted into-without adhesives. \n \nBefore entering the museum this object belonged to Dr Meymar, a Turkish bureaucrat who lived in nineteenth century Cairo. The wooden mount is a later addition which was added when the object entered a private collection. It probably dates to the late 19th century. This object formed part of the Meymar collection \u2013 a collection of Islamic and Middle Eastern objects collected by the Turkish bureaucrat known as Dr Meymar who was based in Cairo in the 1860s.This collection was exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1867, from where the South Kensington Museum (V&A) made a large number of purchases to enhance their growing collection of Islamic art. Together with the collection of Gaston de Saint-Maurice (accessioned in 1884), the Meymar collection was the foundational collection of \u2018Saracenic\u2019 art \u2013 or the art of the Mamluks (ruled Egypt and Syria 1250-1517A.D) \u2013 in this museum.",
