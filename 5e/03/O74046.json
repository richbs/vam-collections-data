Early in his career (before he became famous) he made clothes for his mistress and in his autobiography \"My First Fifty Years\" (Gollancz, 1931) he describes how he attired her with \"great elegance and piquancy. I remember a costume of black cloth with a little black pelerine that stopped at the shoulders. She wore it with a little black tricorne hat surmounted by a white cock's head with a red comb. It was a delight.\"\n\nThe lace pattern was probably based on an earlier design from the school of decorative art he extablished in 1911 and called 'Martine'. The dress has a dropped waist which is pointed at the front. It is sleeveless with a front V neck and a back square neck. The skirt (over a double petticoat of gilt tissue and black net) is gathered into the waist and shaped by short horsehair frills under the gathers. The bodice's meandering abstract pattern is set against the skirt's stylised bold flower heads and both are enlivened by gold highlights.\n\nGiven by Mr Vern Lambert\nThe Cecil Beaton Collection\nT.338-1974"
