As an apprentice to his father, he made figures in clay, attracting the interest of the portrait painter Alexander Mosses (1793-1837). Studied in his spare time at the drawing school of the Royal Institution, Liverpool, and apprenticed to a local painter and engraver. Achieved local success as a portrait painter and for his 'candlelight' studies, and exhibited frequently at the Liverpool Academy from 1831, although he did not become a member. Exhibited seven works at the RA in 1840 and 1846, all single figure studies such as a beggar and a friar, except for the portrait of ' Sir Joshua Walmsley' (see p65) who seems to have been his chief patron. The <i>Magazine of Art</i> writer recorded that he 'lived boisterously ... But he also felt the fascination of strong drink'; he is supposed to have declined to paint Prince Albert. He died at Everton, 13 October 1880. \n\nLIT: <i>Magazine of Art</i> June 1882, pp341-3; H C Marillier <i>The Liverpool School of Painters</i> 1904, pp95-8 \n\n<b>George Stephenson</b> \n364-1872 Neg H313 \nCanvas, 55.4 x 38.7 cm (21\u00be x 15\u00bc ins) \nGiven by Sir Joshua Walmsley 1872\n \nGeorge Stephenson (1781-1848) was the famous inventor of steam locomotion and founder of the railway; the Liverpool and Manchester Railway opened in 1830. He is holding a design for a viaduct. \n\nThe following inscription, written by the donor, was on the backboard of the painting:\n \nThis portrait of the Eminent Engineer George Stephenson Was painted from life in 1846 for Sir Joshua Waimsley by Wm. Daniels; The likeness in earnest discussion was eminently successful: It has never been copied and must eventually become an object of great interest: The name of Stephenson like that of Shakespeare will live in the grateful recollection of his Countrymen and this Effigy of the Mechanic of the Tyne will be as much esteemed as that of the far famed 'Bard of Avon'. \n\nThe painter's power of illustration were only exceeded by his eccentricities of character: Like Morland many of his pictures were pronounced 'Gems of Art' In troubles oft, In prisons not unfrequent, he was another instance of Great Talents being sacrificed to debasing Habits. \n\nJoshua Walmsley\n\nThere are many portraits of Stephenson, including the family group by an unknown artist in the Science Museum; for a full iconography see R Walker <i>Regency Portraits</i> 1985, I, pp479-81. Walker suggests that Daniels's painting was copied from Mrs Mary Hamilton's miniature (exhibited RA 1836 (735), now Science Museum), which shows Stephenson in a somewhat similar pose holding a roll of drawings of which the top one is for the Sankey Valley viaduct. The drawing held by Stephenson in the present painting may also be for that viaduct. Walker's suggestion is unlikely; Stephenson and the donor were friends and business associates, and Walmsley's son recorded that 'It was during one of his [Stephenson's] visits to Ranton [Ranton Abbey, Walmsley's house near Stafford] that the portrait was painted that now hangs in the South Kensington Museum, and considered by the \"old man\" the best likeness ever taken of him'. \n\nIn his 1857 biography of Stephenson, Samuel Smiles wrote that 'His fair, clear countenance was ruddy and seemingly glowed with health ... The mouth was firmly marked and shrewdness and humour lurked there as well as in the keen grey eye'.\n \nEXH: <i>National Portraits</i> South Kensington Museum 1868 (490, lent by Sir Joshua Walmsley)\n \nLIT: H M Walmsley <i>The Life of Sir Joshua Walmsley</i> 1879, pp76-7, 142\"",
