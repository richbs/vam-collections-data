Original text submitted in English reads: \n\n2: 32. Yogi\nGranite; 45 cm high\nIndia, Tamil Nadu, 18th century CE\nVictoria and Albert Museum IS.252-1953\n\nThis impressive and unusual stone sculpture depicts a Hindu ascetic or yogi, a person who has renounced the role of householder within Hindu society and has mastered the practice of yoga.  Yoga, deriving from a Sanskrit root meaning \u2018to yoke\u2019, is a combination of mental and physical training and discipline aiming ultimately to enable liberation from the mortal world. There are a variety of forms of yoga mentioned within Hindu literature, including HaTha yoga and Raja yoga, which is described in PataNjali\u2019s yogasutra (c. 2nd century BCE \u2013 6th century CE).\nHere the yogi is shown seated with his legs held by a meditation strap or yogapatta, which helps the yogi keep his meditative posture. The geometric designs on this band recall a common yantra or symbolic, meditational diagram. He has the ascetic\u2019s long hair and beard and his necklace, bracelets and rosary are of rudrakSa beads, seeds which are especially sacred to Siva and often worn by his devotees. The third eye on his forehead symbolises the special insight acquired by yogic meditation. \nThe figure may represent a specific historical or legendary sage famous for his teachings, his advanced meditation or his performance of severe ritual austerities, which produce tapas or inner heat. It may have been made for a temple or monastery where this yogi was venerated or with which he was associated.\n\nCam Sharp Jones and Nick Barnard",
