The cards are shuffled and dealt singly in clockwise direction.  \nStart of the game:  The player on the dealer's left asks one of the players for a card he needs to complete a quartet and this player surrenders the card if he has it.  The first player may go on calling for cards he needs until another player asked does not have the card asked for.  Now this player goes on calling for the cards he needs according to the same procedure, etc.  Players who have a card asked for and by mistake do not hand it over must pay a fine to the player asking for the card.  Finally every player gets as many points as he puts down complete quartets.\nIt is important to try to remember and reason out who of the players has the cards neede to complete a quartet, so that one is lucky when calling for the cards.\n\nRule 2\nAny number of players may participate.  After thoroughly shuffling the cards, they are dealt singly by one of the players.  Complete quartets consisting of cards marked with the same symbol in the upper left corner are put on the table face up.  The player on the dealer's left draws one of his neighbour's cards and keeps it.  This procedure is followed by all players and every quartet thus completed is put on the table.  The player who has the greatest number of quartets is the winner.\n\nRule 3\nThe cards are shuffled and each of the players is dealt 8 cards.  The rest of the cards are spread on the table face down.  One of the players picks up one of the cards and in exchange puts one of his cards face down on the table.  Now it is the other player's turn to pick up a card.  Every quartete thus completed is put on the table.  The player who has first put all his cards on the table is the winner.\n\nAs a reward the winner may choose one of the delicious dishes of the German Fruit Quartete and mother surely will prepare the first prize:\nRecipes are given for Apple Pancakes with sugar and cinnamon\nCoconut Pears\nPlum Compote\nStrawberries with whipped cream.",
