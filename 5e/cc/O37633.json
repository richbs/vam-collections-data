The image\n(slightly recessed on a flat mount of ivory card) shows a group of\nforty-three boys of varying ages, and three men (the eldest of whom is\nprobably the headmaster) in rows outside the doorway of a brick\nbuilding with large sash windows, presumably the school.  The\nheadmaster, who has a moustache and wire-rimmed pince-nez, sits in \nthe middle of the second row, and wears a three-piece suit with a wing \ncollar and dark tie; on his left is a younger man, also in wire-rimmed \nglasses, and wearing a suit; another, without glasses, is seated on his \nright.  The boys wear a dark uniform with single-breasted jackets, long \ntrousers, white shirts and dark ties, with a certain amount of \nnon-conformity allowed in the wearing of different types of collar, pocket \nhandkerchiefs, tie-pins etc. This photograph shows the same school as \nin B.1214-1993, but on another, later occasion (judging by the \nappearance of some boys on both images).",
