A combination of high skill, international salesmanship and competitive pricing took Genevan work to the Ottoman Empire and the Far East. Boxes of this form were made for the Far Eastern market. Many such objects were acquired as souvenirs by soldiers during the Boxer Rebellion and the Opium Wars in China and as a consequence found their way back to Europe.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world\u2019s great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
