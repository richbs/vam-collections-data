The taking of tea developed into a social ritual, practised mainly by the wealthier classes, for tea was an extremely costly luxury commodity. The material, form and decoration of a tea service reflected the status of the owner.\n\nForm\nThis type of teapot is generally described as 'bullet-shaped', owing to its globular form, which developed from earlier pear-shaped examples. The restrained engraved decoration around the upper body and the cover are characteristic of modest tea wares of the period.",
