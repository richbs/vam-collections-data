An annotation in the top right hand corner suggests that it is the part for the 1st Violin. Various handwritten notation is used to indicate points at which the music would pause to allow speech.\n\nThis music comes from a collection of manuscript music relating to the 'Cooper Family', one of whom, Alfred Edward Cooper (1840-1901) worked as a 'Chef d'Orchestre'/Master of Music at the City of London Theatre and playhouses in South East England. Throughout his career Cooper collected and composed 'melos' to provide incidental music for Melodramas. \nThis piece, though not composed by Cooper, is likely to have provided incidental music for one of these Melodramas which were popular in the nineteenth century. Such dramas often featured a limited number of 'stock' characters: the hero, the villain, the heroine, an aged parent and a comic man engaged in a sensational plot featuring themes of love and murder. \nIn the melodramas produced in Paris, London music supplanted dialogue or, more often, augmented stage language, actors' gestures, and dramatic action, to evoke an emotional response or provide an aural signal of the true nature of a character.",
