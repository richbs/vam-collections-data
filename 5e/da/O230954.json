Central back panel, shoulder seams, set-in small stand-up collar [badly seamed]. Pieces added to the sides to form a flare with pronounced curved section over the hips. Short sleeves made from one panel each.  There is a diamond shaped opening under each arm. Fairly narrow opening at the neck tapers to the bottom where there is a slight overlap.\nThe main fabric has a 'gold'ground which [silver strip open S-wound on a yellow silk core] divided into angular segments: fairly curvy figures-of-eight placed horizontally and large, upright rectangles between pairs of small upright squares arched at one end.  The effect is of coiling stems, intertwining to create compartments which contain small floral patterns. Yellow and red bands form loom/piece ends and are included in the left front panel near the side seam and in the centre of the right front panel. \nLining: roller printed white ground with small brown and red maple leaves within coral-like scrolls in brown used for the body of the jacket. At each sleeve end is a small piece of dark blue ground cotton printed with segmented botehs in red, light blue, green, yellow and white.\nFacing: striped woollen twill: brown-red stripes and blue stripes with small motifs and white stripes with a meander, diagonal blue leaves and red s-motifs.",
