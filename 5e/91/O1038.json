The coloured twist stem and double loop were supposed to be reminiscent of 17th-century Venetian stems. John Tallis, in his History and Description of the Crystal Palace (1852), described the 'delicate twisted stems' of Bacchus' glasses as 'novel and chaste'.\n\nPeople\nGeorge Bacchus & Sons was a Birmingham firm, previously known as Bacchus, Green and Green. They were one of the leading British glassmakers of the mid-19th century, keeping up with and sometimes creating stylistic and technical developments. They were known for, among other things, flashed glass and transfer-printing on glass, and by 1848 they had become  the first English firm to produce Venetian-style millefiore glass (made from composite sections of coloured glass cane).\n\nHistorical Associations\nBacchus' collection of glassware at the Great Exhibition was described as 'not large but well designed and executed'. He exhibited examples of coloured and cased glass, cutting, engraving and enamelling. The range of vessels included a flower-stand, vases (including some cased in green and in ruby), a tazza (or shallow bowl), wine glasses, an enamelled sugar bowl and butter dish, cut glass decanters and engraved goblets.",
