There is no decoration or elaboration and the plywood on this example is left unstained.  The design derives entirely from the use of the trolley.  Easy access to the lower tier is ensured by dispensing with uprights at two of the four corners, giving the impression that the upper shelf is cantilevered from the frame. It was designed by Gerald Summers who ran the Makers of Simple Furniture.  His original design drawing, dated 28 January 1935, specifies that it should be fitted with 'Flexello' castors, and the sales catalogue added that each level was covered with rubber that could be removed for cleaning (the rubber is no longer present on this example).  Many variations on the appearance of the trolley were possible. The rubber was offered in brown, green, red, blue, black or white, and the wood came in a choice of white, black or natural polish (as here). The original list price was \u00a36 6 0.",
