Traditionally, the cannon was cast as a tube and a separate breech plug with a screw thread cast. A thread was then cut in the barrel to recieve it and the whole mounted on a wooden bed/sled which enclosed the breech. In Europe the piece was cast like a vessel, closed at one end, thus avoiding the problem of closure and containment of the gases of the charge on ignition.",
