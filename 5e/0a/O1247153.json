Its official authenticitywais guaranteed by a holographic sticker on the reverse. The other vehicles in the range included a TX1 taxi, a Mini, the Concorde and a Tube Train.\n\nThe first Corgi diecast models were made by Mettoy in 1956, and were marketed as 'the ones with windows'. This Routemaster bus, first seen on the streets of London in the same year, features not only windows, but also Olympic route numbers and an open platform at the back.",
