The same motifs are engraved on the rim although the number differs, and similar design adorn the body. The rosette on the bottom of this piece, as can be judged from what remains, was also similar. The bowl is also related through its decoration and epigraphic style to the bowl 20262 in the Musee des Art Decoratifs, which carries the initial word of the standard title 'Heir to Solomon's Kingdom' carried by the Sultans of Fars. (Meleikian-Chirvani, Le Bronze Iranien, pl. 70, inscription p. 71) \n\nThe design of the fish on the inside of the bowl is a literal visual rendition of the Persian poetic image of the cheshme-ye aftab, 'the Fount of Sun', the Fount being symbolized by the fishes.",
