This pattern is repeated on 3 sides around the central panel and in between is a wide band on 3 sides with isolated upward pointing floral sprays each with 3 carnations.  The ground around these has been quilted using blue silk and a diamond pattern.  The rectangular central panel is divided into a lobed arch by a band of yellow and blue chevrons outlined in green.  It contains offset rows of floral motifs: a pale flowers outlined in light blue with green leaves and pink leaves or buds outlined in black, alternating with a small 4-petalled flower outlined in black. One of the larger flowers is worked in blue. There is a compartment in the upper part of the arch which is lozenge-shaped with the 2 upper sides lobed.  It contains a small vase, a large blue flower [carnation?] and leaves or buds outlined in black.  The spandrels are divided into a broken grid of diamonds formed by unconnected small leaves and diamonds.  Each compartment contains a small floral sprig with he petal outlined in black.\nEmbroidery Thread: black, yellow, dark green, light green, light blue, dark blue, pink, light brown, white silk; 2S\nBacking: blue plain weave cotton, hand-woven, block printed with offset rows of an odd motif: round white flowerhead with faint black markings.  At one end is a yellow 'stem' and at the other is a light brown triangle with a darker brown spot.  There is evidence of green at this end.\nFacing: bias-cut, dark blue cotton.",
