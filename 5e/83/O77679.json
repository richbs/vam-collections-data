Here, porcelain may be seen to be taking over the traditional role of glass for fruit or salad. \n\nDesign & Designing\nLoosely copied from 18th-century S\u00e8vres porcelain, Staffordshire porcelain patterns with ground colours and shaped panels in reserve became highly popular in the 1830s. This basic pattern (no. 5061) was also made in claret red, apricot, lime green and three shades of blue. The moulded, lobed and wavy-edged shape of this bowl follows contemporary metalwork rather than traditional wheel-thrown ceramics.\n\nCollectors & Owners\nThis bowl is part of a service that was acquired by the V&A from Miss H. M. Gulson, who had inherited it from her uncle, Josiah Spode IV (1823-1893). Although the V&A wished to accept only a token number of pieces because of the impossibility of displaying the service in its entirety, eventually it agreed to take all rather than destroy the integrity of a documentary service. Since 1902 the service has largely remained in store. The British Galleries now provide a fitting permanent display of the many different shapes used in the service.\n\nThe Spode family provenance suggests that the service should represent the grandest and most opulent porcelain made at the factory at Stoke-on-Trent in the last years of Spode ownership. The factory archives, now available to collectors, show that the moulded shape is 'Amherst' (named after Lord Amherst, a popular Viceroy of India who retired in 1828) while the pattern 5061 was introduced in 1832. It would seem therefore that Josiah Spode IV, only nine years old in 1832, may have inherited it later from his own father, Josiah Spode III.",
