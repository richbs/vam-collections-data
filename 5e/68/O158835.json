Upper end has one row of stitching in light purple wool, then 15 shoots light purple wool followed by 2 cms. plain weave with cream weft turned and stitched in place.\n\nDESIGN: field has a cream ground; there are nine vertical lines largely in purple and they rest on a saw-toothed diagonal lattice.  The bottom left/top right lines are in purple, the others in red and blue.  Within the lattice the bar bears a cross-shaped motif with a blue cross above and below a light orange octagonal centre.\n\nThe main border is along the sides and the lower part only and has a blue ground.  Red, stepped lozenges alternate along the sides with hooked bars.  The bars are part light orange and part cream.  Along the lower border the motif changes to opposing arrowheads in either cream or light orange.\n\nThe inner and outer borders are along the sides and lower part only and are a reciprocal \"running dog\" design in cream and purple with outer guard stripes in cream and blue.\n\nThe upper border lies along the top of the five-sided field and the side borders.  It has a purple ground filled with narrow horizontal lozenges in contrasting colours.  The border is divided vertically by the central line which extends beyond the field to the tip of the pile.",
