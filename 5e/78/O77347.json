            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nThis print by Pierre Fourdrinier combines two printmaking techniques - etching and engraving. Both involved creating a pattern of grooves to hold ink in a metal printing plate. The image on the printing plate was the reverse of the final image. The etched lines were made using acid, while the engraved lines were scored by means of a sharp tool called a burin. The grooves were then filled  with ink and the image was transferred onto a blank sheet of paper.\n\nPlace\nHoughton Hall is a magnificent country house in Norfolk. It was built by Sir Robert Walpole, the Prime Minister, in the 1720s and early 1730s. \n\nSubject Depicted\nThe large image in this print depicts a ceiling as seen from below. The small image at the top shows the cornice, or topmost section, of the wall of the same room. The two indentations correspond to the decorated ribs that protrude down from the ceiling into the room. It is clear from this layout that the designers and publishers behind the book could assume that the reader would know how to interpret architectural designs.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe ceiling is symmetrical and made up of regular geometrical shapes. At the centre, two pairs of rectangles of different sizes flank an octagon. This format  is influenced by Italian Renaissance designs, such as those published by the architect Sebastiano Serlio (1475-1554).\n\nUse\nIsaac Ware's book on Houghton Hall was published only a few years after the house was finished. It was a forerunner of the magazines available today, featuring the homes of the rich and famous.",
