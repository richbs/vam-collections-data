A turning point in her approach became evident in the early 1980s. Together with her avant-garde contemporaries she explored jewellery as body sculpture in non-precious materials. In her most acclaimed collection, 'Wire Wear', she explored the 'edges of where jewellery meets clothing' through body jewellery made of plastic-coated steel wire. \n\nManheim pushed the boundaries of jewellery in scale and wearability to the limits, then moved on to making large scale abstract sculptures of papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 or wire. The use of papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 goes back to 1983 when Manheim worked with children in this material. It is now the preferred medium in her recent sculptural work. \n\nThe artist has developed a wide range of colour and expressive painterly effects in her work with paper, as is exemplified in this necklace. The pieces makes a strong sculptural statement, and as with Manheim's work contributes to the debate about jewellery as a free art form.",
