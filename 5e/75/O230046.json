He has been considered as something of a maverick amongst black British artists for the way in which he has used the stereotype black man/woman, but he has used this motif with sophisticated irony to explore black experience often through the prism of historic European painting.  In After the Dance Ofili has produced a silkscreen print which mixes references, visual and cultural, derived from jazz, as well as sources in art history ranging from Symbolism and German Expressionism to Picasso. The setting is inspired by Trinidad, where he has lived since 2005, and the dancing couple in this earthly paradise are lifted directly from a 1960s photograph by the acclaimed Malian photographer, Malick Sidib\u00e9. The photograph has a personal resonance for Ofili, and he owns a copy of it.",
