She studied art at St John's Wood School of Art and the Royal Academy Schools and then began a career as a painter, travelling widely in Europe and North Africa. During World War II illness forced her to rest for a year and during this time, for her own amusement, she produced designs for A Midsummer Night's Dream and Macbeth. On recovering her health she took the designs to London where they were eventually seen by the director, Michael Benthall, who commissioned her to design his production of The White Devil at the Duchess Theatre in 1947. This was the beginning of Audrey Cruddas's theatrical career: she went on to design productions of Shakespeare at Stratford-upon-Avon and the Old Vic, West End plays, and operas. Her designs for Caesar and Cleopatra, which starred Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh, won the 1952 Donaldson Award for outstanding achievement in the theatre when the production toured in America.\n\nCruddas designed the costumes and settings for Henry V, which was directed by Michael Benthall, with Richard Burton in the title role.",
