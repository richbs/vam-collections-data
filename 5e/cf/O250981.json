He was knighted in 1895, the first ever actor to be honoured in this way. According to Museum records, a death mask of Irving was commissioned by the actor-manager, Sir George Alexander who was employed by Irving and accompanied him to America in 1884-5. The mask was subsequently given to Mrs. Aria, a great personal friend of Irving, by Lady Alexander, in the late 1920s. This is apparently the only original mask in existence; other surviving versions are cast after it.\n\nSir George James Frampton (1860-1928) was an English sculptor, medallist and decorative artist. He worked in an architects office before being apprenticed to a firm of architectural masons. He studied modelling a the London School of Art under W.S. Frith, and in 1881 entered the Royal Academy  Schools, where he won a gold medal and travelling scholarship in 1887. Like Lanteri he was involved in the exterior decoration of the Museum, executing the spandrel reliefs of Truth and Beauty above the Main Entrance.\nFrampton was elected an Associate Member of the Royal Academy in 1894 and exhibited regularly across Europe, contributing to the Munich and Vienna Secession movements.",
