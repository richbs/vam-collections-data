The designer, Ivan Ivanovich Murinov, was a glass painter who became artistic director at the Imperial China and Glass Works in St Petersburg from 1894-1901. During his last years there he supervised the production of pieces in the Art Nouveau style. Murinov much admired the work of the French glassmaker Emile Gall\u00e9, which influenced the decoration of this vase. Waterweeds and snails were popular in Japanese art. Here, as in Gall\u00e9's work, these natural forms have been used as symbols of mystical ideas.",
