In this region the Hungarian language was prohibited, Hungarian schools were closed and living standards were very low.  This poster is significant because it is an open declaration of sympathy with people living in Romania. This was a taboo within the Soviet bloc because the principal of 'socialist internationalism' prohibited the criticism of a political ally. Any criticism of Romania's policy towards minorities was denounced as reactionary nationalism.  The taboo was broken as opposition movements gained strength in Hungary preceding the transition from communism to democracy. \n\nIn June 1988, a torchlight procession was organised in the Hungarian capital Budapest with around 100,000 participants. Krzysztof Ducki designed this poster to advertise the procession protesting against Ceausescu's policies in Romania which included the destruction of a huge number of Hungarian villages in the interest of forced 'development'. \n\nDucki choose a seemingly spontaneous graffiti style for the poster, achieving a highly dramatic and sinister effect.",
