            "public_access_description": "This portrait of Arthur Hill-Trevor, 3rd Viscount Dungannon was painted by Stephen Catterson Smith PRHA (1806-1872).  Smith trained at the Royal Academy Schools in London from 1822 before studying in Paris and gaining a reputation for his skill in black chalk portraits.  This proficiency led to royal patronage and later to commissions in Ireland.  He moved to Londonderry in 1839 where he stayed for six years painting portraits and small genre scenes. In 1845 he moved to Dublin, where he lived for the rest of his life and became a highly successful portrait painter to some of Ireland's most distinguished families.   His work has been described as being in the style of the celebrated English portrait painter Sir Thomas Lawrence (1769-1830).\n\nArthur Hill-Trevor was born and educated in England but in 1837 succeeded his father as third Viscount Dungannon, a member of the Irish peerage.  In 1855 he was elected representative peer for Ireland in the House of Lords.  He was an active public figure who published several political pamphlets and a two-volume Life and Times of William III.\n\nThis particular portrait was commissioned as a gift to the sitter's wife, Sophia, by the 3rd Viscount of Dungannon's tenantry.  It was exhibited at the Royal Hibernian Academy in Dublin in 1856.  The painting was given as a gift by Viscountess Dungannon to the Victoria & Albert Museum in 1871, nine years after the Viscount's death.",

Moved to London and entered RA Schools 1822; won silver medal for oil painting at Society of Arts 1824. Studied in Paris; lived in Yeovil, Somerset, about 1830-8; moved to Ireland 1839, first Londonderry, then Dublin 1845, becoming a highly successful portrait painter in the style of Lawrence. Exhibited eight portraits at the RA between 1830 and 1858, two works at the BI 1828-33, but principally at the RHA from 1841. Elected ARHA 1844, RHA 1845, PRHA 1859-64 and 1868. Director of NGI 1868. Many of his works were engraved, and his black chalk portraits published in lithograph. Died Dublin May 1872 (20 May in DNB, 30 in Strickland, 31 in <u>Art Journal</u>). His wife Anne was a miniature painter, and his sons Stephen and Robert also artists. \n\nLIT: <u>Art Joumal </u>1872, p204 (obit); W G Strickland A <u>Dictionary of Irish Artists</u> 1913 \n\n\n<b>Arthur Hill-Trevor, 3rd Viscount Dungannon </b>\n226-1871 \nCanvas, 243.7 X 165 cm (96 X 65 ins) \nGiven by Viscountess Dungannon 1871 \n\nExhibited at the RHA in 1856, the work was commissioned as a gift to the sitter's wife by the Viscount's tenantry. \nArthur Hill-Trevor (1798--1862) was born in London, educated at Harrow and Christ Church, Oxford, and elected MP for New Romney in 1830, Durham 1831 and 1835. He succeeded his father 1837 as 3rd Viscount Dungannon (of the second creation in the Irish peerage), and was elected representative peer for Ireland in the House of Lords 1855. He published several political pamphlets, and a two-volume <u>Life and Times of William III</u> (1835-6). He married his wife Sophia in 1821 (she died 1880); the present painting was presumably intended to be a companion piece to the earlier and similar sized portrait of her by John Hayter also in the V&A collections (see 227-1871, p124).
