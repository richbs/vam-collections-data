            "public_access_description": "Between 1928 and 1932 Aalto was influenced by tubular-steel furniture. In 1928 he ordered many pieces of metal furniture designed by Marcel Breuer for his own house, and the following year he designed his first cantilevered chair, made from tubular-steel legs and a plywood seat. He designed other armchairs and armless chairs in the following few years, all of which were inspired by Breuer's and other European models. In 1931, though he was still working in tubular steel, Aalto began a move away from metal. Perhaps inspired by his thinking about the needs of patients at the Paimio sanatorium - an isolation hospital he designed for tuberculosis patients in the forest east of Turku - he began designing all-wood chairs. In an oft-cited lecture in 1935 Aalto specified the ways in which tubular-steel furniture was not 'rational':\n\n. . . a piece of furniture that forms part of a person's daily habitat should not cause excessive glare from light reflection; ditto, it should not be disadvantageous in terms of sound, sound absorption, etc. A piece that comes into the most intimate contact with man, as a chair does, shouldn't be constructed of materials that are excessively good conductors of heat . . . These criticisms . . . when put together form the mystical concept of 'cozy'.\n\nThis chair might be termed a transitional design that marked the end of Aalto's attempts to create cantilevered chairs with tubular-steel bases, and his move to designing two-legged chairs entirely in wood. In its form, it was still a translation rather than the radical rethinking that his contemporary furniture for Paimio was. A child's version of this chair had been designed in 1931-2, but an adult-sized chair required relatively thick legs to support the sitter. As Aalto clearly wished the chair to be springy, the leg design needed  considerable development. The legs were made from moulded, laminated Finnish birch and the seat from much thinner birch plywood. The nature of the material was emphasized by the choice, in this example, of birch with a curly figure or grain for the seat and back.",
