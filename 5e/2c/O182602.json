The main border is on 3 sides and has a quilted ground with a diamond pattern in white silk.  It has a thin green leafy meander which goes through elongated red leaves outlined in green with red pointed flowers.  The inner border is the same design as the outer border; it is on three sides around the central rectangular panel. This panel is divided into a lobed niche by green lines of embroidery.  The spandrels are filled with a pattern formed by pairs of green leaves which form an X-motif with a green diamond centre, together they form an unconnected diamond lattice with a small pointed red blossom and 2 buds in each diamond. At the top of the niche is a roundel with a red ground and green inscription. The niche is patterned with offset bands of a floral stem with 3 red carnations and is quilted in a diamond pattern with white silk. There is a printed motif [it looks like a carnation sprig] by the roundel.\nBacking: white cotton.\nFacing: bias cut; two shades of blue silk forming a fine check.",
