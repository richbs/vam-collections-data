The pattern consists of narrow close-set red stripes on a ground of dark blue, of which the warp is tinted white.  At either end is a knotted fringe.\n\n1975 Description:\nPerraje Jaspeado (Tie-dyed shawl). See T.87-1931 for general information on shawls and jaspe. The perraje is a balanced weave with a blue cotton weft across a warp of narrow stripes of red cotton and jaspe (ikat dyed) blue/white cotton.  The warp threads are set close together so that the fabric is predominantly warp-faced.  It has a typical knotted fringe (for similar one see L M O'Neale 'Textiles of Highland Guatemala' (1945, fig.49).\n\n\n1995 Notes:\nThe fringe is formed by warp threads at either end.  The weft is black.  There are 76 warp threads per inch and 27 weft threads per inch.  From the right hand side the colour sequence is: a pair of red threads, a single red, pair of blue, single blue/white ikat thread, pair of blue and another pair of blue. The selvedges are blue.",

The Eisen Collection, made in Guatemala in 1902), contains nothing similar.  Mexican rebozos, both old and new, use more finely spun yarns and have narrower stripes than do Guatemalan ones.
