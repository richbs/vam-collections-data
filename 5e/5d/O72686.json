In a nationally reported incident, she was ran aground and was badly damaged on her way to have her engines fitted. Newly build by William Patterson, who assisted Brunel with both his Bristol built ships, the Demera was towed back to this dry dock for repair. \n\nCalvert Jones made many marine studies in watercolour as well as by photography. He was one of the first to learn of W.H.F. Talbot's photographic discoveries of the late 1830s through Talbot's friends and relations who lived near Jones in South Wales. His work stands out in the early development of photography because of his ability to fuse his technical skill with the influence of his training as a watercolorist.",

Talbot's photographic discoveries of the late 1830s through Talbot's friends and relations who lived near Jones in South Wales. Subsequently, Jones became one of the few Britons to produce a substantial body of calotypes in Britain and abroad. His work stands out in the early development of photography because of his ability to fuse his technical skill with the influence of his training as a watercolorist.\n\nMany of Jones' marine studies were made at a time of transition in shipping from sail to steam. His photographs demonstrate a movement from predominately picturesque studies of boats to shipyard records and early photo reportage. The newly-built paddle steamer was the second-largest vessel in the world, she was badly damaged on her way to have her engines fitted and towed back to this dry dock for assessment and repair.",

The tall building on the right is the engine works of the Great Western Steamship Company.\n\nThe Demarara was not built in this dock, but was returned here by William Patterson, the Bristol ship-builder, who built her. She was adapted as a sailing ship between 1853 and 1855 when she was undocked under a new name, the British Empire. Bristol Museum and Art Gallery hold a painting of her dated 1853.",
