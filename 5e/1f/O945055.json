Boehler's, Munich. The Albertina drawaings (Albertina Catalogue , 1, nos. 361-64 and 367-68) were attributed to Tironi by H. Voss in an article on the artist in Zeitschrift fur bildende Kunst , 61, 1827-28, pp. 266-70. Pignatti, after seeing our drawings again in 1974, expressed doubts about the attribution, saying that the topographical errors and the faulty perspective are not in accord with Tironi's customary accuracy (oral communication). The last work by Pignatti quoted summarises all that is known about Tironi so far. 1186 View looking towards S. Simeone Piccolo on the right and the Scalzi and S.

A letter written by Moschini in 1806 states that 'Our poor Francesco Tirnoi is much to be mourned, died too young a few years ago\u2026' (See Beddington, p. 130 and p.151, ft.2). The volume of views <u>Ventiquattro isole della laguna disegnate di Francesco Tironi incise di Antonio Sandi</u> (<u>Twenty-four views of islands in the Venetian Lagoon</u>), published in 1779, were engraved by Antonio Sandi after drawings by Tironi. Many of the original drawings for these engravings have been identified, allowing attribution of further works based on stylistic comparisons to be made. \n\nThis view looks up the Grand Canal in a northern part of the city. Mercharnts and gondolas carrying passengers are shown crossing this busy waterway against a backdrop of buildings along the canal. In the right distance the church of <i>San Simeon Piccolo</i> can be identified by its high dome. This church, design of Giovanni Scalfarotto (1670-1764), was built between 1718 and 1738. The Neo Classical style of <i>San Simeon Piccolo</i> contrasts with the elaborate baroque fa\u00e7ade of the <i>Chiesa degli Scalzi</i> on the opposite side of the canal. Built by Baldassare Longhena (1654-72) the monumental fa\u00e7ade was erected by Giuseppe Sardi (1672-80) and is attributed to the sculptor Bernardo Falcone (active 1659-94). In the right foreground of the view is the <i>Palazzo Diedo</i> now the Palazzo Emo. Built at the end of the seventeenth century and attributed to the architect Andrea Tirali (Circa 1660-1737), this palazzo is decorated with a greek temple fa\u00e7ade, with a pendiment over three arches above the main entrance to the building. \n\nThe drawing, in pen ink and wash with heightening, is highly finished. It was probably designed as a work that could be bought by visitors to Venice on the Grand Tour. \n\nReferences: Beddington, Charles. <u>Venice, Canaletto and his rivals</u>, National Gallery Company, London, 2010, p.130.",
