Other types were either cylindrical, or of the more popular and capacious baluster shape.\n\nOwnership & Use\nMany recipes for posset survive and there are numerous references to the drink in diaries and letters of the period. In 1625 Katherine Paston wrote to her son, a student at Cambridge: 'I hope thou dost not eat of those possety curdy drinks, which howsoever pleasing to the palate it may be for a time, yet I am persuaded are most unwholesome and very clogging to the stomach.' The diarist Samuel Pepys recorded drinking a posset after a night of revels in 1668. As well as being given to women after childbirth and to those returning from the fields in winter, they were used to revive anyone too weak to eat a full meal. Possets sometimes replaced the evening meal during Lent. \n\nDesign & Decoration\nPosset pots were specially designed for this nourishing drink, which was sometimes thickened with bread, oatmeal or biscuits; the crust  could be eaten with a spoon, while the liquid below could be sucked through the spout. A disproportionate number of posset pots have survived, as they were often used only on special occasions and given as gifts. Elaborate forms and designs evolved: for example, a series of delftware examples spanning the period 1631 to 1744 survive, as do several lead glass versions by the glassmaker George Ravenscoft (1632-81). At the end of the 17th century delftware, Staffordshire slipware and glass posset pots became large and highly decorated, indicating a high point in their ceremonial function which, by the middle of the 18th century, seems to have fallen into disuse.",
