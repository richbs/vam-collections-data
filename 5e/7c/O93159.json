            "public_access_description": "The cities of Nuremberg and Augsburg dominated the goldsmiths\u2019 craft in Germany from the 15th to the early 19th centuries. Engraved designs for silver flowed off their printing presses into workshops across Europe. Their goldsmiths and merchants travelled widely, the former sometimes settling in cities that promised new sources of patronage, the latter selling silver goods as far north as the Baltic Sea and as far east as Russia. \n\nA Spanish traveller, visiting Nuremberg in 1483, noted its prosperity and the great number of craftsmen who supplied goods for a far-reaching network of trade routes. By its heyday in the mid 16th century, much of the city\u2019s silver was exported but the city council, guilds, merchants and wealthy local families also patronised goldsmiths. In the archives of the Imhoff family of Nuremberg, an account book recorded deliveries of jewellery, cutlery, tableware and cups by the outstanding goldsmith Wenzel Jamnitzer (1508-85).\n\nNumerous designs for silver were published for a European-wide market. A local taste for silver shaped like trees, fruit and other natural forms, seen frequently in engravings by the Nuremberg artist Albrecht D\u00fcrer, spread as far as England. Tall standing cups with lobed bodies like bunches of grapes and beakers imitating contemporary glass drinking vessels were specialities of the city.\n\nDespite the brilliance of late 16th century goldsmiths like Han Petzolt (1551-1633), who revived late medieval styles, a reluctance to embrace new styles contributed to the eventual decline of Nuremberg as a centre for goldsmiths\u2019 work. By the middle of the 17th century, it had been eclipsed by Augsburg.",
