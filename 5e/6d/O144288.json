These copies are paper impressions, taken by a simple process, much in the same way as rubbings from brasses, and coloured by hand. They are therefore in effect almost facsimilies, reproducing the size and colour of the originals. The series includes examples of mosaic work, dating from the fourth century, when the walls and vaulted roofs of Christian basilicas first began to be covered with mosaics, down to the times of Raphael; and such visitors to the Museum as have not seen Italy, and perhaps only know the originals from small woodcut illustrations in popular Handbooks of the History of Art, may obtain a very good notion of them by examining these full-size reproductions.\n\nWe may add here that these coloured impressions of Christian mosaics were made by Mr Caspar Clarke, who was sent to Italy by the Science and Art Department, in 1872, after the late Director of the Museum and Lieutenant-Colonel Scott had inspected the original works.'\n\nCaspar Clarke, who made these copies, was sent to Italy by the Sciences and Art Department, in 1872, after the late Director of the Museum and Lieutenant-Colonel Scott had inspected the original works.",
