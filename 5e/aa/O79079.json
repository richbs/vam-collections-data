The elaborately carved cresting and panel in the back look original, but other parts appear to have been added later, such as the chair seat, the carved initials and the shallow carving around the seat rails. The chair was probably altered between 1880 and 1910. Antique dealers sold many such chairs at that time. They were often heavily repaired, with extra carving sometimes added for greater visual effect, and to increase their value.\n\nOwnership & Use\nThe initials A.C. and E.M. on the seat and E.P. on the front uprights, and the date 1682, were probably added later to add interest and do not relate to real people. According to the person who sold it to the V&A, the chair was bought between 1910 and 1920 from a sale at Thorp Hall, Thorp Arch, West Yorkshire. The history of the chair before that time is unknown.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe chair is made of oak. The seat is a replacement, and there are holes for an earlier strung seat on the seat rails. The front and back feet have been mended in a very crude way. This might have been done deliberately to increase the appearance of age, although it is impossible to prove.",
