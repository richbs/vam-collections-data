One of the oldest charity houses, it was displayed at The Building Centre in New Bond Street in 1936 for the purpose of raising funds for the Middlesex Hospital. It was also lent to the Victoria and Albert Museum to be shown at the Children's Exhibition in 1936. The inspiration for the project came about as a result of seeing a German dolls' house dating from 1750 and observing how it reflected the lifestyle of the time. The house was built by chauffeur and carpenter William Purse and the furnishings and inhabitants were made by Moray Thomas and Basil Hunt, a talented maker of models. The house can be taken apart for ease of travel and was clearly intended as a reflection of the lifestyle of the very wealthy.",
