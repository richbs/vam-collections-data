Extensive glass table services became increasingly popular towards the end of the 19th century, especially after  press-moulded glass was introduced. This sturdy piece is blown and then further shaped by hand, with wheel-cut flat panels. It was probably made for use in a public caf\u00e9.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThis piece is made of lead glass. In the 17th century a higher proportion of lead oxide was introduced into glass during manufacture to offset the problems of 'crizzling' (a fine network of tiny internal fissures within the body of the glass). The resultant lead glass was clear and brilliant, and especially suited to cut decoration. Cut patterns are created using rotating disks of various materials and sizes with a stream of water and an abrasive. First the pattern is painted on the surface and intitially rough-cut. It is then refined with a copper or sandstone wheel, and finally the finished object is polished. Steam-powered wheels were introduced in the early 19th century.",
