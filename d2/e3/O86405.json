            "physical_description": "The painting, n opaque watercolour on paper, shows a standing lady in profile facing right with her right arm extended and her hand gesturing upwards. Her left hand rests upon a red cane.  She is dressed in a gauzy transparent <i>peshwaz</i>overdress with long tight sleeves that reveals her breasts beneath and  her red <i>paijama</i> which are dotted with a scrolled leaf pattern ending in a double row of pearls round her ankles.  The open V-neck of the dress is edged with pink-tipped, chevron-shaped lappets which join just below her breasts before parting into a skirt with gold-edged gores reaching down to the hem. In the central opening a golden patka with a scrolling floral design in pink and red is tucked into her paijama waistband and falls full-length to the hem of her dress.  She wears a pair of burgundy-coloured slippers decorated in a  golden pattern which reveal her reddened heels that match her red finger tips.  Her loose hair is covered with a transparent <i>odhani</i> (veil) edged in gold which is draped over her left shoulder  and hangs down her back with a decorated floral end on a gold ground.  She wears ropes of pearls as bracelets on her wrists and a jewelled armlet is visible under her <i>odhani</i>.  Further pearls and green gemstones decorate her ear and neck.  She also wears a cross-over pearl body ornament clasped between her breasts with a red gemstone.\n  She is shown standing on a stretch of green grass dotted with a variety of flowering plants against a turquoise-green background which rises up to the top of the painting where  streaks of gold and pink  suggest a notional sky. A strip of paper one and a half centimetres in depth has been added along the top and painted blue.\n  The image has also been extended along its lower edge by an additional one and a half centimetre strip of paper painted in a cruder fashion to show a white-lily pond with two little fish in it.\n  The painting is mounted on the page with an inner border of a faded pinky-orange colour decorated in gold with a scrolling foliage pattern edged in gold with white and black outlines and an outer line in blue.  The main border of the page is ivory coloured with a row of pink lilies and red poppies outlined in gold.  The margins of the page have blue strips of paper with a white outline collaged along the edges. That on the right hand side is rather damaged probably when the album was rebound and a grey strip of paper added as a gutter for the present album binding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndhani</i> (veil)",

The binding is covered with an Indian brocade silk that may have been cut from lengths brought home by the 2nd Lord Clive, who served as Governor of Madras, 1799 to 1803.
