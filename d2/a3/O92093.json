About the same time, the earliest signed, and therefore identifiable, Li\u00e8ge-made firearms were produced. In 1743 the arms industry of Li\u00e8ge is said to have been turning out 100,000guns a year for the various armies of Europe. Towards the close of the ancien r\u00e9gime (French, \u2018old regime\u2019, that is, before the French Revolution), nearly 6,000 persons are said to have been engaged in it. These figures make it clear that production was mainly concentrated on military arms. Nevertheless, there was an important trade in fine-quality arms from about 1672 onwards. \n\nLi\u00e8ge-made firearms by such masters as Devillers and de Selier followed French fashion of the time. They seem to have had the current Parisian pattern books at hand to serve as examples, especially those of Simonin. These, for instance, provided the patterns of silver inlay on the grips.",
