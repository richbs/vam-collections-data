            "public_access_description": "Tiny was one of two ventriloquist's dolls used by the semi-professional ventriloquist Ronald Warner (1910-2004), bought by him from Davenport's shop in the late 1920s and probably made by the renowned vent-doll maker Arthur Quisto (1882-1960). He was used by him at a concert on 27th May 1930 at the Empire Theatre, Edinburgh, when Warner was a Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve officer, throughout the 1930s, and after Warner completed officer training for the navy at HMS Collingwood in Hampshire. When Warner was a naval officer during the Second World War he made what he called: 'typical and topical performances' as a ventriloquist when ashore, and according to a theatre programme, Tiny was certainly used in a Malta Relief Fund concert in Port Said, some time around 1942. When he appeared at the Empire Theatre, Edinburgh, on 27th May 1945 at a Victory Variety Concert, Ronald Warner was on the bill as 'Sub-Lieut. Ronald Warner RN., the Navy's Edgar Bergen' - a reference to the successful contemporary American ventriloquist.\n\nRon Warner made his last appearance with Tiny at the Garrison Theatre, Edinburgh, during the week of the 11th November 1945, in a Variety Concert with the Calder Girls, Speciality Dancers; Philip Malcolm, Baritone; Ella Haston, Vocalist; George McCormick, Tenor; Cable and Carr, Scots Comedy Duo; and Dick Telfer at the organ.  \n\nRonald Warner was influenced in the act by that of the respected ventriloquist Arthur Prince (1881-1948) whom he met after seeing him perform at the Croydon Empire with his sailor doll Jim.",
