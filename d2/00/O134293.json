As she describes it: 'The Metropolitan Police present their latest big idea on how to combat terrorism \u2013 a team of sniffer dogs to patrol the tube. Photographs appear in all the papers of the cuddly spaniels, which do little to reassure the public.'\n\n'Marf' drew daily topical cartoons for the Evening Standard between March 2002 and August 2005, moving to the Londoner's Diary page in August 2003. The drawings cover key political and social issues of the period, providing a vivid and often hilarious response to the main news of the day. The Evening Standard is London's only evening newspaper, publishing up to five editions a day. In Marf's own words: 'The cartoonist needs to keep up with the rapid pace of event.'",
