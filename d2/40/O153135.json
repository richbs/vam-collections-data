In between this row of red flower heads is an 8-petalled blue rosette with a red centre framed with a green leafy stem forming a heart-shaped vase with a neck from which emerges [2] a similar red flame multi-petalled flower surmounted by two small green leaves.  In between each flower head a thin green leafy stem with two small tulip buds in red and blue edged in white curves over a small 8-petalled blue rosette with red centre. This is the smaller version of the design and therefore is similar to one of the sections which makes up Circ.376B-1922.\nThis is a loom end marked by a narrow band of red weft and along the lower edge.\nSized on the back.  There are noticeable weaving faults.",
