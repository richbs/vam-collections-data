Millet produced many sketches of this type while staying at Vichy between 1866 and 1868. He would rent a carriage to explore the landscape, in particular the hilly uplands above Cusset, stopping frequently to make rapid pencil or ink drawings in small sketchbooks. These sketches were later re-worked in the studio when the artist added watercolour.\n\nThis watercolour presents an expressive, densely foliaged landscape. Landscapes without figures are rare in Millet's work, however, the wildness of this environment is tamed through subtle elements of human presence. For instance, barely visible farm houses, roofed with small tiles indicative to the farming region of Vichy, and fields lined with dark plow marks are representations of peasant labour which were common subjects for Millet, who praised the roles of labourers and illustrated the lowerclass with dignity. \n\nMillet was a founding member of the Barbizon school of painting whose members also included Jean-Baptiste Camille Corot, Th\u00e9odore Rousseau, and Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Daubigny. The group advocated a push toward Naturalism and utilized muted tonalities, looseness, and soft rendurings.",
