Because the style of the present piece is extremely close to another piece in the museum (Inv. No. 375-1871) and its dimensions match exactly, there is the possibility that they come from opposing sides of the same set, perhaps differentiated by the treatment of their borders.\n\nThe game of tables, or backgammon, was popular in the 11th and 12th centuries. There were 15 counters to each side, and 12th century boards inlaid with bone sections have been excavated at Gloucester and Saint-Denis. About 250 Romanesque tablemen with figurative designs survive. The game was popular throughout Northern Europe and the pieces were made in a number of different centres, with the most productive workshops based in Northern France and Cologne",
