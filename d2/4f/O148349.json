The bold handling of the chalk and dynamic stance connect it with early drawings by Titian, but the confusion in the understanding of the kneeling pose seen from a low viewpoint suggest a lesser hand in Titian's circle. Ionides bought the drawing in 1882 from J.C. Robinson, one of the leading connoisseurs of the day, who had formerly served as the V&A's 'Art Referee'.",

Fr\u00f6hlich-Bum suggests a Brescian artist, perhaps Moretto. Tietze and Tietze-Corat maintain, perhaps rightly, that the drawing is too weak for Titian. They point out that \u2018it is difficult to tell on which knee the man is kneeling; his right shoulder and arm beneath the cloak cannot be felt, and the foreshortened hadn is a surprise.\u2019 Puppi compares the drawing stylistically with the Christ carrying the Cross in Budapest (Feny\u00f6, fig. 21) and apparently regards both drawings as by Titian; whereas Feny\u00f6 has come to the conclusion that neither is by him.",
