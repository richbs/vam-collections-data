            "public_access_description": "Originally, the prophet in this panel would probably have formed part of a large Jesse Tree window. Jesse was the father of King David, and the Old Testament prophet Isaiah prophesied that the Messiah would come from the House of David. He wrote: \u2018A shoot shall come out from the stump of Jesse and a branch shall grow out of his roots\u2019 (Isaiah 11: 1\u20133).\n\nJesse Trees were common in medieval art during the 12th and 13th centuries. They are intended to show the genealogy (ancestry) of Jesus Christ which is described in the Gospel of St Matthew.\n\nMost Jesse Trees have a reclining figure of Jesse at the bottom with a vine or tree growing up from him. In the centre the branches hold kings from the line of David. Flanking them are figures of the prophets who foretold the coming of Christ and proclaimed his ancestry.\n\nRecent research has suggested that this panel and another in the Victoria and Albert Museum (Museum number: C.3-1983) came from a Jesse Tree window in Soissons Cathedral in France. Many of the windows in the cathedral were badly damaged during the 16th and 19th centuries. Many of them have been restored, and some of the damaged glass has been replaced with glass from another church. This has confused the original iconography (subject matter depicted in the windows).",

Their style is similar to those at the Sainte-Chapelle.\n\nShe believes they came from Soissons because the figures are similar in style to figures from some Soissons panels which no longer survive and are only known from photographs. We don't know if Soissons even had a Jesse window but it is likely that they did.\n\nLouis Grodecki believed that artists from Sainte-Chapelle worked at Soissons because there are similarities in the painting style of the faces and hair. \n\nThis panel and the Worcester panel were made from the same cartoon. The cutlines are almost identical. The Worcester figure has a purple robe and a yellow cloak. This V&A one has a red robe and a green cloak.\n\nSoissons Cathedral was heavily damaged in a Huguenot attack in 1567. \nIn 1815 two powder magazines exploded near the cathedral and destroyed nearly all the windows in the nave and damaged some in the ambulatory. \nThis glass was replaced with some from the abbey church of St. Yved in Braine.\nIn the 1860s major restoration work was undertaken. \nIn the 1880s the glass was removed and much glass was dispersed before WWI. \n\nThe surviving windows suffered extensivc restorations that have altered original settings and compositions. Whole windows were transferred from their original locations.",
