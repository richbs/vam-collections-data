The head has a broad nose with splayed nostrils, full fleshy lips and prominent eyes with pronounced upper and lower lids under arched eyebrows. The hairline is a shallow ridge delineating the cap-like hair with a band of vertical lines at the brow. The right ear is half obscured by a large undecorated ear ornament. The head emerges from an arc of double lotus petals carved in a soft rounded Kushan style with an incised line at the margin and another down the centre of each petal.",
