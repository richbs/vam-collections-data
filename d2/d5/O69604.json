This work is an alloy that was similar to bronze but acquired a red patination pickling solutions were applied after casting.\n\nThe piece is called 'Post Equitem Sedet Atra Cura' (Behind the Rider sits Dark Care), and was made in 1899. \n\nSir Alfred Gilbert (1854-1934) was a famous British sculptor of the late 19th century. He was also medallist, goldsmith and draughtsman. He was known for his inventiveness and characteristically used many different materials in the same work. He epitomised the movement known as the \u201cNew Sculpture\u201d, with a new focus on naturalistic forms. His many commissions included for example the celebrated figure of Eros, part of the Shaftsbury memorial.",

The title of the piece is from Horace, but the composition of the piece is derived from a number of Renaissance sources, notably Durer's <u>Knigh, Death and the Devil</u>, Donatello's <u>Gattamelata</u> and Verrocchio's <u>Colleoni Monument</u>. The original model dates from shortly after Gilbert's visit to Venice in 1883, but this bronze, along with another version in the Royal Scottish Academy, was cast in March 1899, perhaps commissioned by Robert Dunthorne.",
