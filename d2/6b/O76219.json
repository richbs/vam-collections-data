            "public_access_description": "The inro  is a container made up of tiers. Japanese men used them because the traditional Japanese garment, the kimono, had no pockets. From the late 1500s onwards, Japanese men wore the inro suspended from their sash by a silk cord and a netsuke (toggle). They originally used it to hold their seal and ink or a supply of medicines. However, it rapidly became a costly fashion accessory of little or no practical use. Most inro  are rectangular with gently curving sides. Sometimes the entire body could be modelled in the form of another object. This most unusual example is modelled as a temple bell. It has no tiered sections, but the central part of the bell opens up in an ingenious way.\nFrom the 1700s onwards, many more artists signed the inro they made. Ogawa Haritsu (1663-1747), widely known by his art name Ritsuo, signed this one. He was a talented and versatile artist who specialised in ceramics, painting and lacquer. His lacquer work typically has inlay in a wide variety of materials, such as glazed pottery, pearl-shell, ivory and hardstones. He also used lacquer to imitate other materials. Here he has used brown lacquer to simulate patinated metal for a temple bell.",
