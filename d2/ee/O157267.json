Trafalgar chairs have a continuous curving line down the back, along the seat rail, over the knee and down the 'Grecian'  front leg. The first published design for this type of chair was in a trade catalogue in 1808 (the London Chair-Makers' and Carvers' Book of Prices Supplement) which used the name 'Trafalgar' chair. The form became more widely known when it was illustrated in the monthly periodical Ackermann's Repository in 1809. Ackermann described it as 'of Grecian form', but illustrated another version in 1814 when he described it as 'A Grecian parlour chair, otherwise called Trafalgar'. Naval references on furniture, such as the rope-twist back, had been popular since Nelson's victory in the Battle of the Nile in 1798.\n\nOn loan to Provost Skeen's House.",
