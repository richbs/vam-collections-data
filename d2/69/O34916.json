W.12B-1967) are part of a group of furniture displayed by the Austrian manufacturer Carl Leistler & Son of Vienna at the Great Exhibition held in London in 1851. The furniture was presented to Queen Victoria by Emperor Franz Josef of Austria and installed at Buckingham Palace. Later, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert decided to refurbish the royal palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh for use during their Scottish holidays, and the Austrian furniture was moved there. It was given to the University of Edinburgh by King George V in 1923. \n\nThe design of the pedestal is based on an architectural column with arches and foliage in the Gothic style, which was very popular with German designers and manufacturers of furniture in the 1850s. The pedestal was originally used to display carved figures by the sculptor Anton Ritter von Fernkorn.",
