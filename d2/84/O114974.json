Here he learnt to design grotesques through assisting Giovanni da Udine in the Vatican Logge. Until his death in 1547 he played a major role in the development of the Mannerist decoration style.\n\nThis is a design for a covered tazza with three small-scale sketches of simpler, variant designs by Perino del Vaga. The figures on top of the cover are a woman with a unicorn, representing chastity. Perino painted this subject several times, notably in the frieze in the Sala di Perseo in the Castel Sant' Angelo, Rome. A unicorn resting in the lap of a virgin was the impresa of the Farnese family whose members held high ecclesiastical office and were patrons of art in Italy, especially in the 16th and 17th centuries. This suggests that this could have been a commissioned design.",

There were very few clasical prototypes to copy at the time except despictions on medal and vases. Pompeii and Herculaneum were discovered only 200 years later.\nNot many renaissance objects, especially precious metalwork have survived (most often melted down and converted into currency). Becuase of these losses, drawings and prints provide important primary documents of Renaissance designs for decorative arts.",
