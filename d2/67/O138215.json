Prior to this, most of the glazed, both lead and tin-glazed, ceramics found in Italy were imports from Egypt and North Africa, and were used primarily as decoration in church facades (known collectively as 'bacini'). Some of the earliest imported glazed ceramics date to the 10th and 11th centuries. It appears that the attractiveness of this imported glazed material encouraged local production of glazed wares throughout the peninsula of Italy.",

I also spoke by telephone with David Whitehouse, Director of the British School at Rome and in my view the best expert in this field. Whitehouse was in no doubt that this piece is genuine and cited some parallels most of which I had already turned up already. He was convinced the bowl came from North Apulia and can be dated to late 13th or early 14th century. We have nothing like this and he said the only museum outside Italy that has anything comparable is the Cluny in Paris\u2026\n\nJoan Prentice von Erdberg\nThe Burlington Magazine, Vol. 92, No. 571 (Oct., 1950), pp. 283-287",

            "historical_context_note": "The production of tin-glazed tablewares (maiolica) starts in Italy around the year 1200. Prior to this, most of the glazed, both lead and tin-glazed, ceramics found in Italy were imports from Egypt and North Africa, and were used primarily as decoration in church facades (known collectively as 'bacini'). Some of the earliest imported glazed ceramics date to the 10th and 11th centuries. It appears that the attractiveness of this imported glazed material encouraged local production of glazed wares throughout the peninsula of Italy.\n\nLead-glazed tablewares are known to have been produced int he region of Apulia in southern Italy in the 11th and 12th centuries. However, tin-glazed tablewares do not appear in Apulia until the early decades of the 13th century. Production centres have been found at Brindisi and also at Lucera where it is probable that the technique was introduced by Islamic potters from Sicily.\n\nTin glaze is a lead glaze rendered opaque by the addition of tin oxide. Early tin-glazed wares (maiolica) have a dull glaze due to the small amount, 3-5%, of tin oxide added to the glaze mixture. The more tin oxide added to the glaze mixture, the brighter, or whiter, the resultant glaze becomes. Italian pottery production centres had to imprt their tin which increased the costs of production and would explain why little tin was used in the earliest products.",
