Usually this type of chair has two supports for the back. As the seat of the chair is caned, it is fitted with a cushion, made to resemble the original, which was called a squab.\n\nPeople\nMatthew Boulton, the manufacturer of metalwares, may have ordered this chair around 1805 for Soho House, his home in Birmingham. It is one of a pair that was sold in 1988 from Great Tew Park, Oxfordshire, the home of his descendants. The other chair is now at Soho House.\n\nOwnership & Use\nKlismos chairs appeared in Britain around 1800. Thomas Hope, a collector of classical Greek vases, furnished his London house with klismos chairs by 1801. He illustrated views of its interiors in his book Household Furniture and Interior Decoration in 1807. Other collectors of classical Greek vases who may have owned klismos chairs include the architect Sir John Soane and the artist Adam Buck.",
