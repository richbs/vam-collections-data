            "physical_description": "Resht work, plain weave felted wool, patchwork, inlaid work, embroidered with silk in a variety of stitches predominantly chain stitch; backed with blue cotton. Note: researchers may use the terms applique and tambour when searching for this category of textile even though they are incorrect.\nThe rhomboid shape has two cutaway sections [to accommodate the stirrups] with a 'square' central field in dark brown, 65.5 x 78 cm.  In the centre of this field is a small blue, pink and red vase holding blue and white flower heads and pink buds. This motif is framed by a lobed trefoil shape in a light brown surmounted by a larger trefoil frame containing more multi-coloured flower heads and leaves, from both frames emerge four main light brown curving and sinuous lines each terminating in a dragon's head, four with 'limbs'.  simple bird forms in red or blue are placed on the field. Both the field and motifs are extensively embroidered. This field is pieced with three small but different Resht fabrics in five fragments:\n[a] black ground with an embroidered cream meander supporting pink rosettes and light blue star-shaped flowers with green leaves and white/grey buds.\n[b] dark brown with a light beige leafy stem holding a red trefoil shape and half a beige/yellow rosette.\n[c] light brown with an embroidered cream stem holding a serrated light grey leaf and a small mid-green leaf, half a beige rosette and a dark trefoil shape.\n[d] as [c] but with a red 'spade' like bud and half a flower head.\n[e] as [b] but with a red 'spade' like bud and half a green leaf.\nThe central field is edged with a red border on one side [1] with a small strip of blue [but this is badly faded except for one length]. On the other side a pieced strip of light brown, in places incorporating a narrow blue stripe; this stripe begins and ends either side of the cutaway sections.\n[1] the pieced red border is probably not from a larger or longer section [ie. Embroidery is not continued over the seam].  It is decorated with an embroidered cream meander holding beige or brown pointed buds, 6-petalled rosettes in dark green, black and light blue according to the piece, with a dark blue, brown or dark green tri-lobed bud.  This border continues down the sides of the two cutaway sections except for a small area on the right where a similar red insert is pieced; this carries only a thin embroidered meander carrying half palmettes in cream silk. \n[2] Top and bottom up to the cutaway sections is a wider black band patterned with an embroidered cream meander holding a series of two varieties of multi-coloured exotic flower heads and two shades of green, blue, red leaves.  A secondary double meander is formed of a line of light brown or occasionally red 6-petalled rosettes.  In the bottom two corners an irregular red rosette holds a head and shoulders image of a young turbaned man against a blue ground and embroidered stems and leaves.\n[3] a repeat and/or continuation of [1] edged with a narrow dark blue strip.\n[4] the outermost edging is red [pieced] with occasional embroidered single boteh pointing to the left along the bottom and lower side edges, in cream, light blue and brown.\nAround the cutaway section a narrow braid [tablet woven] in black silk with thin lines of white, yellow and pink edging a line of very small pink lozenges.\nWhite 'pearl' circles appear occasionally.\nAt least three types of multi-coloured chain stitching down the central 'spine' of the dragon body/stem, on two birds, on one variety of flowers in band [2] and on the garment edging of the two figural  medallions.  The chain stitch is in two colours.\nAll seams are concealed by a cord of 2x2S cream cotton S-plied with Z-spun black silk.\nEmbroidery thread: cream yellow, beige, light blue two shades of red, pink, white.\nInset wool: cream/grey, white, purple, beige, red, dark red, dark green, light blue, dark blue, yellow, dark grey, turquoise, brown, dark brown.\nThere is a backing of plain weave blue cotton [pieced] with repair stitching evident in places.\nAlso evidence of interlining in outermost band [4] and in the top of [2]: plain weave heavy cotton dyed to match.",
