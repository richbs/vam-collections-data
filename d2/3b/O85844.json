It was not until mid-18th century that we can see examples of prams depicted in paintings and prints.  These early prams were built to be pulled not pushed, which meant that the mother was unable to keep an eye on her child and they frequently fell out.  The first 3-wheeled pram, designed to be pushed from the back was made by an unknown maker in 1840.  Today the 3-wheeled all terrain push chair has once again become fashionable, even in miniature for children to play with.",
