To explore ideas about mapping and route-finding, the artist used the colours of the lines from the classic tube map devised by Henry Beck E.816-1979). David Shrigley drew the lines as a confused tangle, to be magically clarified and organised when one unfolds the map.\n\nPlatform for Art, London Underground's art programme, commissions artists to create work for the travel network. This continues London Transport's tradition of commissioning artists to create publicity material. As part of this programme, some artists were invited to create covers for the London Underground pocket map.",
