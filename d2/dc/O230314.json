Each adopted what has since become an iconic character to star in their games. Nintendo had Mario, a short Italian plumber, and Sega had Sonic, a blue hedgehog. This is the second Sonic game which introduced Sonic's friend and rival Tails, a fox with two tails. His arch-enemy Dr Robotnik is still the evil character who has to be defeated.",
