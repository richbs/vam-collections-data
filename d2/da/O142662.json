It is decorated with two composite birds' wings in bright turquoise feathers. This style of oversized hat was incredibly popular at the end of the first decade of the 20th century. Fashionable hair styles were worn frizzed out and piled up onto the head in order to support the large hats and add volume to the top of the silhouette.\n\nThe title of the hat 'Bleriot' refers to the first cross-channel flight by French aviator Louis Bleriot in 1909.\n\nThe hat was one of a collection donated to the museum from the wardrobe of Heather Firbank, sister of the novelist Ronald Firbank. In her youth Heather Firbank bought stylish clothes and hats from London's top design houses and department stores. This hat was made in Brighton, at the time a very fashionable seaside resort south of London.",
