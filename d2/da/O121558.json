His cloisonn\u00e9 enamels are characterised by the skilful use of intricate wirework and superb attention to detail seen here. The silver wire delineates the pair of cloisonn\u00e9 enamelled birds perching on a flowering cherry tree on a flat ground of matt green enamel. \n\nThe designs on his earlier pieces are relatively traditional. They consist mainly of stylised botanical and formal geometric motifs, as seen on the neck of this vase. This piece also has the mirror-black enamel ground for which Yasuyuki was renowned. The applied rims and foot ring are of the copper/gold alloy known as \u2018shakudo\u2019.\n\nThe designs on much of his later work tend to be more pictorial. They consist mainly of scenes from nature and views of landmarks in and around Kyoto. His work included both pieces with designs predominantly defined by wires and pieces where the pictorial composition is balanced by large areas of pure coloured enamel, as on this small vase.",
