To the back of her head is a black 'halo' hat edged with red and with flowing red ribbons from the back; on the proper left side of the hair are small flowers.  She wears a low-necked, long-sleeved blue bodice trimmed with 'gold' frogging, with a matching dolman jacket over the right arm; the knee-length red skirt is overlaid with a small white petticoat, caught up on her right side side.  At her waist is a small barrel.  On her feet are heelless red ankle boots with white fringe and buttons.",

National dances and settings were popular in the 1840s as audiences became increasingly aware of 'abroad' and exotic locations.  Scotland, Spain, Hungary, Poland and the Balkans were all popular settings and some ballets were set as far afield as India, giving the opportunity for balleticized versions of national dances, like the Cachucha, mazurka, polka, polonaise, tarentella or Cracovienne.",

The British lithographs are notable for capturing individual performers and their style, often clearly in a theatrical setting.  They enshrine dance and its interpreters at one of its greatest periods.",
