The product, which could be woven in a variety of patterns, was attached over bentwood frames and often imitated popular furniture forms made in other materials. \n\nReplacing wicker furniture which was more expensive and less durable, Lloyd Loom furniture was produced in vast quantities from the 1930s and the 1960s. Production-line methods reduced costs but allowed little creative input for individual craftsmen. This chair is given a Moderne feel by the step pattern in the black and gold toning.\n\n[Gareth Williams, 'British Design at Home', p.110]",
