In the Meiji period (1868-1912) the script of the play 'Shibaraku' (Wait!) became fixed and the name of the main character was designated as Kamakura no Gongoro Kamemasa. Originally, the plot and the characters were created anew each time it was performed. Virtuous men and women, about to be cut down by an evil lord and his servants are saved by a man with superhuman strength. When this hero appears on stage, he utters the words 'Wait! Wait!' which at first was the only part of the play which was fixed.\nOban size. Signature: Toyokuni ga",
