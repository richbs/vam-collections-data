At the age of sixteen he was apprenticed to Matthew Boulton, of Soho. After the retirement of his father in 1793, Edward started a manufactory of gilt and plated buttons, then also medals, tokens, works in bronze, and silver and gold plate. His output was considerable.\nThis medal is one of a set  of 48 medals commemorating the Elgin Marbles, which had been placed in the British Museum in 1816. They were issued in a set of five folio size leather bound books, accompanied by a descriptive book.",
