There is evidence of previous insect infestation with  minor losses at the pr side.  A rust-coloured woven paper fascia covers the front of the chassis and is edged with wooden moulding painted white. Two white plastic tuning knobs to the left are aligned horizontally with the speaker to the right.  The hinged lid opens to reveal a pink turntable, record storage, control panel and additional switches set into a square plywood panel which has been screwed on at a later date (nb see object history note).  The lid and record storage are lined with green felt where there is minor damage from previous insect infestation.

The preliminary drawing for this radiogram, now in the RIBA drawings collection, dates from 1946. There are significant differences between the design and the finished product. On the design, the legs are bentwood in the manner of Alvar Aalto\u2019s pre-war furniture: the finished object has splayed timber legs which look forward to the aesthetic of the 1950s. The arrangement of the dials and speakers on the front of the cabinet were also altered and betray the influence of Christopher\u2019s brother Ben\u2019s abstract compositions. The record storage, shown behind the flap at the side of the drawn design, was moved under the lid to be more convenient. The radiogram was produced by Ferranti in 1947, and this example stayed with the Nicholson family after Christopher\u2019s death in 1948.",

ISBN 1-85490-445-0 [preliminary drawing for radiogram, plate 76, p 99]\nIntroduction gives an account of Nicholson's career, describing his important role in the development of Modernism in Britain.  A selection of Nicholson's drawings are reproduced.\n'The radios and television sets which Nicholson designed  after the Second World War for Ferranti were treated like pieces of furniture (plates 76-80).  His advanced design aesthetic and fascination with new materials suited a company working at the cutting edge of technology.  He was also familiar with electronic equipment.  During the War, Nicholson piloted almost every type of British aeroplane made at the time and was attracted by the dazzling display of indicators, gauges and switches to be found in their cockpits.  For each radio, television and radiogram, Nicholson made dozens of alternative designs, playing with the simple shapes of rectangular dial and grille, the round knobs and the square picture screen.  Ben's abstract designs had been translated into product design.' [p 18]",
