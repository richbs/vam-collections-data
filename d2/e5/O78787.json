They complemented the light muslin gowns, adding a touch of colour and functioning as a light wrap inside or out of doors.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe most highly-prized shawls were the kashmir shawls imported from northern India. British shawl weavers soon began to imitate Indian designs, imaginatively blending borrowed Indian motifs with those of European origin. The basic design layout on this Spitalfields shawl, with its plain centre and deep borders, is very similar to that on a genuine Kashmir example. However, the individual details, such as the bell-shaped flowers and the bright primary colours, are distinctly European in character.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe bright yellow and green used in this shawl are possibly examples of new chemical dyes that were introduced in the early 19th century. This could explain the  patchy quality of the yellow.",
