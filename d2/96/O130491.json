            "history_note": "This print was one of 11 engravings that D\u00fcrer produced in the years 1513 and 1514, a period during which he concentrated on engraving to the exclusion of painting and woodcut printing. It is acknowledged as one of the three master engravings that represent the pinnacle of his achievement in the medium.\n\nThis impression was acquired by the Museum in 1910 as part of the Salting Bequest\n\nHistorical significance: 'St Jerome in his Study' is acknowledged as one of D\u00fcrer's finest engravings and its originality lies in its evocative atmosphere and lighting and the detail given to the interior. Giulia Bartrum points out that the print was particularly popular with D\u00fcrer's contemporaries. According to his diary of 1520-21 he  gave or sold impressions of it more frequently than any other print while he was in the Netherlands. \n\nThe print is full of the physical details of a clerical study including devotional objects, writing implements, books and intimate items such as the saints hat and slippers. Cushions introduce an element of comfort. The realistic objects surrounding the saint give him a convincing presence. Other objects are more symbolic such as the hour glass and skull, signifying the saints mindfulness of mortality, and the lion relating to a legend of the saint. \n\nAs well as depicting St Jerome involved in his translations, the print encapsulates the theme of humanist scholarship in a number of ways. St Jerome was a patron saint of the humanists. D\u00fcrer has used the composition of the print to explore and demonstrate his own learning on classical form and perspective and the rigidly constructed mathematical perspective contributes to the feeling of intellectual and spiritual discipline. Peter W. Parshall has argued (see Peter W. Parshall 'Albrecht D\u00fcrer's St. Jerome in His Study: A Philological Reference' in 'The Art Bulletin', Vol. 53, No. 3 (Sep., 1971), pp. 303-305) that the gourd depicted hanging from the ceiling is a reference to one of St Jerome's famous scholarly debates over a biblical passage (the book of Jonah 4:6) and symbolises the saints intellectual rigour.\n\nSt Jerome is one of the Church Fathers. He was an ascetic and theologian famous for translating of the bible into Latin and revising existing translations. He is often depicted with a lion in reference to a legend in which he was befriended by a lion after extracting a thorn from it's paw.",

            "production_note": "This print is usually known as 'St Jerome in his Study'. D\u00fcrer himself referred to it as 'St Jerome indoors'", 
            "historical_context_note": "St Jerome appears more frequently in D\u00fcrer's work than any other saint. He produced six prints of St Jerome during his career (including his first signed wood block). He also depicted St Jerome in a landscape for a small devotional panel painting (now in the National Gallery, London). D\u00fcrer's interest in St Jerome reflects the increasing veneration which was given to the Church Fathers during the 15th century. The date of this print coincides with the year of publication of the translation into German of St Jerome's biography by D\u00fcrer's friend Lazarus Spengler\n\n'St Jerome in his Study', 1514, 'Knight, Death and the Devil', 1513, and 'Melancholia I', 1514 are generally referred to as D\u00fcrer's master engravings. The three prints are comparable in size, the complexity of their iconography and the high quality of their execution, but do not have any direct compositional relationship and there is no evidence that D\u00fcrer treated them as a set when he sold or gave them (Bartrum, Guilia. 'Albrecht D\u00fcrer and his Legacy'. The British Museum Press, 2002. p 185). Their thematic connections, however, have suggested various collective interpretations. Friedrich Lippmann saw a correspondence with the scholastic classification of the virtues as moral, theological and intellectual with 'Knight, Death and the Devil' representing the active, practical Christian life, 'St Jerome in his Study' the spiritual life of contemplation and 'Melancholia I', the life of secular intellect and genius (Panofsky, Erwin. 'The Life and Art of Albrecht D\u00fcrer'. Princeton: Princeton University press, 1955. p151). While 'Knight, Death and the Devil' and 'St Jerome in his Study' have been seen as a comparison between the active and contemplative Christian lives, 'St Jerome in his Study' and 'Melancholia I' have also been paired as a contrast between life in the service of God and life in competition with God (Panofsky p 156).",
