            "public_access_description": "Claude Cahun is the pseudonym  of Lucy Schwob (born Nantes 25 October 1894 \u2013 died Jersey 8 December 1954) who was a French photographer and writer. Her work was both political and personal, and often played with the concepts of gender and sexuality. \n\nShe published articles and novels, notably in the periodical Mercure de France.  Later, she associated with the surrealist group, and participated in a number of surrealist exhibitions, including the London International Surrealist Exhibition (New Burlington Gallery) and Exposition surr\u00e9aliste d'Objets (Charles Ratton Gallery, Paris), both in 1936.\n\nThe prints that form part of the V&A's collection relate to the photomontage illustrations published in Cahun\u2019s  autobiographical essay, 'Aveux non Avenus' ('Disavowed Confessions') (Paris: Editions du Carrefour, 1930). The \u2018half plate\u2019-sized glass negatives used to re-photograph her montages were hidden by Cahun during the occupation of Jersey (where she and her partner settled in 1937) and only rediscovered in 1971. No vintage prints of the images are known to survive and they are only otherwise known in the original book form. Cahun is not known to have made platinum prints, preferring to use gelatin silver,  and so the distinction that these are modern prints \u2013 made using platinum \u2013  is subtle but clear. These prints are not intended to be facsimiles of originals but rather to serve as a record of the negatives in the absence of any known vintage prints.",
