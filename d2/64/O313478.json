Francis I was overshadowed by his wife (married in 1736), Maria Theresa , the Habsburg heiress. \n\nFrancis Stephen (8 December 1708 \u2013 18 August 1765) was Holy Roman Emperor and Grand Duke of Tuscany, though his wife effectively executed the real power of those positions. With his wife, Maria Theresa, he was the founder of the Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty. From 1728 until 1737 he was Duke of Lorraine (as Francis III) but he surrendered in exchange for the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. He was the father of the later executed French Queen Marie Antoinette.",
