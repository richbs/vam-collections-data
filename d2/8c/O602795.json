TURNER (1775-1851)\nAutumn-Sowing the Grain, 1818 (R.817)\nLettered with the title and <i>From an original drawing by J. M. W. Turner R.A. in the possession of  the proprietors of this work/ London Pub July 1 1818 by T. McLean</i>\nEtching and aquatint coloured by hand.\n26.3 X 35.2cm\nE.5381-1946\nMummery Bequest.\nR=Rawlinson, W. G. <i>The Engraved Work of J. M. W. Turner </i><i>R.A</i>. 2 Vols London, 1908-1913.\n\nThis image was first published in 1813 in four states: outline etching, aquatint, tinted aquatint, and fully coloured by hand with instructions for copying.  It reproduces, the correct way round, a watercolour by Turner of c.1796 in the Paul Mellon Collection.<sup>1</sup>\nLetterpress preserved in the Mummery Bequest (see back cover) shows that this print was originally part of a series of teaching examples based on works by a number of early nineteenth century watercolour painters.  The text describes how the colouring of the image is done, with the aid of painted-in colour samples.  These instructions to the would-be copyist relied on the availability by this time of prepared watercolours in the standard colours quoted.\nSome artists such as David Cox in his A Series of Progressive Lessons intended to elucidate the Art of Painting in Watercolours, first published in 1811, were personally responsible for watercolour painting manuals with colour samples and versions of the same image treated to represent the stages in watercolour painting.  This print is part of the same fashion but is purely a commercial venture done without reference to the artist. \n\n1. Andrew Wilton, <i>The Life and Work of  J. M. W.
