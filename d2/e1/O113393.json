            "physical_description": "Carved oak. The upper and deeper portion has a hinged door in the middle flanked by two panels, all carved with linenfold ornament; the front of the lower portion is occupied by two doors carved with linenfold ornament on a bolder scale. Each side is fitted with two upright linenfold panels with a similar horizontal panel below. It is crowned by a deep moulded cornice. On the upper cupboard are two foliated hinges and a shaped lockplate, all of iron.\n\n15th June 2005\n<u>Notes from Loan visit to Oakwell Hall:\n</u>\nGerman cupboard 'restored'; the back and sides not properly seen.\nPanelled construction, with protruding round pegs showing some distortion. The panels feel old. \nThe top formed of 2 planks applied to a mitred cornice which is pegged to the top rails, a central front-to-back supporting plank held on modern nails and screws.\nEach end formed from 2 vertical linenfold panels above one horizontal linenfold, above blank planks.\nLower shelf missing; wormy hangers survive jointed into front and rear legs.\nThe back with upper section panelled, the lower section (below shelf formed by 2 planks) formed from butted planks (reused?).\nFront lower rail diagonally split at PR foot.\n\n<u>Anomalies</u>\nSome round peg type holes (empty) in lower front panels.\nEscutcheon inverted, as door is apparently old but inverted, with some modern nails on the stile side (lower hinge) and other hand-made reused? \nLower doors not properly hinged.\nMissing lock on upper door.\nUpper section of PR front leg has a metal hook inside, not matched by anything opposite.\nThere are no real feet, and the height feels low.\nThe mouldings around the lower front panels don't match the mouldings around the upper three. Possibly the central and outer upper panels are not originally en suite, the timber looks of a different colour.\nThe mid height front rail has a part-worked groove on the inside (as sometimes found on a cupboard leg).\n\n<u>Summary:</u> Made up (possibly earlier than 19c, perhaps e.g. 18c provincial) using various old elements. Hard to see an explanation for unfinished ends. The back needs to be seen.",
