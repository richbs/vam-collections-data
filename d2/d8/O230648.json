His photographs have been exhibited worldwide and he is regarded as having contributed significantly to the New Topographic movement of the late 1970s. His participation in the important exhibition New Topographics: Photographs of a Man-Altered Environment in 1975 marked a significant turning point in Western landscape photography, greatly influencing subsequent generations of photographers. \n\nBaltz's photographs explore the distinction between natural and man-made landscapes, capturing the beauty of forgotten, desolate environments. His images document the impact of man and civilisation on once uninhabited, pristine landscapes. His series Nevada photographed in 1978, records the urbanization of the New West, juxtaposing inhabited pockets of the Nevada desert with the surrounding wild and natural landscape. His images are always devoid of human presence which further emphasises the anonymity of the man-altered landscapes that are depicted in the photographs.",
