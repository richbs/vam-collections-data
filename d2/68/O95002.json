From 1804 Thomire ran the leading bronze manufactory in Paris. Among its works for Napoleon's court was a cradle designed by Prud'hon for the King of Rome, produced in collaboration with the goldsmith Odiot. Thomire, apprenticed to the bronzier Pierre Gouthi\u00e8re, set up business in 1776, and from 1783 worked at S\u00e8vres porcelain factory to provide mounts. He established a new bronze business in 1804 but Thomire himself retired in 1823.",
