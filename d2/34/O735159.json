The German word for culture (kultur), accompanied by photographs arranged in the form of a Nazi swastika suggests that the culture of fascism is one of violence. \n\nFrom the early beginnings of the war, General Franco and the Nationalists were supported by German Nazi and Italian fascist air support. In late November 1936, Franco ordered the bombing of Madrid as part of a major offensive to take the capital. However Nationalist forces met with violent opposition and were turned back by Republican fighters, including members of the C.N.T. \n\nBesides this French version, Dutch and Spanish versions of this poster were also produced. The posters were probably distributed abroad, aimed at encouraging sympathizers to put pressure on their governments to intervene in the conflict.",
