The smaller top frame, resting on an architrave is cut out to take an oval relief and surmounted by baroques volutes and bordered by scrollwork at the sides, on the face at each corner are applied boxwood cherub heads. On either side of this frame standing on the architrave there is a marble angel. The larger lower frame is designed to take a rectangular panel, and is flanked by baroque scrolls while the face of the frame is ornamented with applied cherub heads and swags in boxwood, while above in the middle, there is a circular shield inscribed 'MRA' in relief. The predella rests on steps and is cut to take an oblong relief which shows a scene of the Adoration of the Shepherds. At either end supporting the altarpiece there are boxwood cherub heads and swags.",
