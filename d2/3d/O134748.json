Apprenticed to the landscape watercolourist John Varley 1806; entered RA Schools 1808. Almost exclusively painted in watercolours, and very prolific. Exhibited 12 landscapes and two watercolours at the RA between 1807 and 1825, six works at the BI 1808-29, one at the SBA 1824, and nearly 800 at the OWS 1814-64 (elected Associate 1824, Member 1826). Despite his nickname of 'Bird's Nest Hunt', he painted a wide range of subjects, but especially fruit and flowers much prized by collectors. Elected Member of the RA at Amsterdam. Died London 10 February 1864; his studio sale was at Christie's 16-17 May 1864. Many watercolours are in the V&A collections. \n\nLIT: <i>Art Journal</i>1864, pl14 (obit); F G Stephens 'William Henry Hunt' <i>Fraser's Magazine </i> October 1865, pp525-36 (reprinted in OWS XII, 1935, pp17-39); W Collingwood 'Reminiscences: William Hunt' <i>Magazine of Art</i> XXII, 1898, pp503-5; C Fry <i>William Henry Hunt</i> Maas Gallery exhibition catalogue 1967; T Jones <i>William Henry Hunt</i> Wolverhampton Art Gallery exhibition catalogue 1981; J Witt <i>William Henry Hunt</i> (1790-1864) <i>Life and Work, with a Catalogue</i> 1982 (with full bibliography) \n\n<b>Self-Portrait</b> \nPI6-1921 Neg HJ241 \nPanel (mahogany), 11.2 x 9.9 cm (4 3/8 x 3 7/8 ins) \nGiven by Alfred Jones 1921 \n\nHunt is aged about 35, dating the work to about 1825.
