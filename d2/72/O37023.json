It is multicoloured and shows a carnival scene with two circular moving trains, a plane and a bell.  The underside is red plastic.  On one end is a bridge and at the other a much larger bridge complex with a bell attached to one side, three tunnels and a yellow plastic lever.  Between the two bridges is a post with a plane attached to it.  \nWhen wound up, a long train goes round one circle and the bell rings.  It is probable that at the same time the plane and the train below should also go round.  The lever is the on/off switch.\n\n*This is a typical toy from the USSR which has been copied by the Japanese maker.  It also seems the maker copied the poor working state of many of the Russian toys.",
