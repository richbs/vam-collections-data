No.84, pp.187-189.\nD\u00fcrer here illustrates a story from Geoffrey de la Tour Landry, <i>Der Ritter vom Turn</i>, an edition of which, published in Basel in 1493, he had helped to adorn with woodcuts. The tale of the cook and his wife, however, was not included among those illustrations. It tells of the cook's wife who had eaten an eel meant for a guest. She told a false story to her husband, but a magpie revealed the truth. In revenge, she plucked all the feathers off the bird's head. Thereafter, whenever the magpie encountered a bald-headed man, it exclaimed: \"So you too have been telling about the eel.\" \n \nThe plate of this engraving is mentioned in the inventory of the estate of Gommer Spranger of Amsterdam in 1637.'\n\np.187\nHeller, Joseph. <u>Das Leben und die Werke Albrecht D\u00fcrer</u>.
