Morris revived the craft of block printing and vegetable dyeing and in his own home he set up looms for tapestry weaving and the hand knotting of carpets. He was highly influenced by historical patterns and was one of the most knowledgeable textile historians of the late 19th century. Morris & Co. was founded by William Morris in 1875, producing textiles commercially for sale in two London shops.\n\nOf the 19 patterns registered by Morris & Co. between May 1882 and September 1885, 17 were designed to be printed by indigo discharge. After washing, the undyed cotton was submerged into the indigo dye vat for the required time. On lifting it out the dye on the cloth, which appeared dark green, quickly oxidized with the air, producing the characteristic blue colour. A bleaching agent was then block-printed onto the areas of cloth not intended to be blue, the cloth was washed and the blue cleared from the bleached areas producing a print of dark blue, pale blue (if the pattern dictated it) and white.",
