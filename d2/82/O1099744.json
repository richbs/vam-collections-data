Like the' sketch' at Windsor, which relates similarly to a finished miniature, (1) legibly dated in this case 1661, this miniature has a special authority in the iconography of the sitter, additionally attested both as to likeness and authorship by the seventeenth-century inscription. \n\nThe status of these' sketches' is especially interesting because of the evidence they bear on Cooper's methods of production. As Murrell points out, Cooper basically was an ad vivum painter, working not from drawings or 'studies' , but directly from the sitter to the end product. This miniature is probably not therefore, strictly speaking, a sketch for the Althorp version, nor was it a pattern for the multiplication of the image.(2) More likely, Cooper at the first sitting worked on two veil urns , intending to bring the second up to a finished state if commissioned to do so. We know from Pepys' account that Cooper kept a constellation of Court images, as it were 'spare' in his studio; they were probably of the kind described in the Terriesi correspondence, (3) and assumed to survive, for example, in the group of Windsor 'sketches'. Reynolds (4) prints a list of the survivors as at present known; to this should evidently be added the four from The Pocket Book, and, judging from the reproduction, the portrait said to represent Ann Temple in the collection of the Viscounts Cobham.
