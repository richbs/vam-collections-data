The figures of two confronted birds (parakeets?) are engraved and inlaid  either side of the broken-off ring handle.  On both sides of the well cartouches enclose engraved epigraphic sections.  The flat rim of the well is decorated with further epigraphic sections.\nAt the rear of the well is a square-ended projection where the ring handle was once attached. Either side of this are two triangular cartouches enclosing foliate scrolls.\nThe meeting of the birds heads on either side is moulded with a rectangular shaped projection. Beneath each pair of parakeets is a palmette-shaped cartouche, which is flanked with triangular cartouches with two incurving sides. The spout is separated from the body by an incised border, both sides of the spout are engraved with a roundel. At the bottom of the spout is a projecting knob.\nBeneath the epigraphic cartouche on either side is a tear-shaped cartouche.\n\n\nThe chamfered foot rises from a flat octagonal rim, supporting a low, incurving, slanting base.  Each facet of the foot is engraved with triabgular panels enclosing foliate scrolls.  A guilloche runs around the slanting, incurving base.\nOne small element of the now missing hinge remains.\n\n\nPatina: uniform olive brown",
