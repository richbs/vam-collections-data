Dating from the mid teens or twenties of the twentieth century, its many different designs, sometimes one to a page and sometimes more, show a range of plants, birds, butterflies and beasts.  Entire layouts are given, as well as single elements.  It was used by the firm of Nam-Quat in what is today's Vietnam, at the time a colonial possession of France. The title page is therefore in French, as are the hand-written descriptions with prices.  A large number of ethnic Chinese have settled in Vietnam over the centuries and might have provided the business impetus behind this embroidery enterprise, undoubtedly aimed, at least in part, at expatriate Europeans. To meet the high demand for such decorated items, the firm had branches elsewhere, including Shanghai, and its desire to reach an international clientele is evident by its entry, and medal success, in competition.  It had the ability to produce many kinds of interior furnishings in a variety of colourways.  The final page has actual silk satin samples in twelve different colourways.",
