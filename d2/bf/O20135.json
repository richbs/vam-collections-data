After two years, Britain expereineced problems with materials supply, particularly wood from the USA.  In 1941 the Government Board of Trade set up the Utility Furniture Scheme as a means of rationing production and consumption of furniture.  The board introduced specifications for controlling the dimensions and materials of pieces of furniture for all over the home: from chairs, kitchen cupboards and wardrobes to babies' play-pens.  The resulting furniture was straight edged, plain and unembellished, in which form very much followed function and construction.  The restrictions went on until 1953, and although Utility furniture furnished many middle-and lower-class homes, it was seen as an austere necessity during the war, and was soon therefore rejected after the restrictions were lifted.'\nFiona Leslie 'Designs for 20th-century Interiors'  London: Victoria and Albert Museum, 2000, p.18.",
