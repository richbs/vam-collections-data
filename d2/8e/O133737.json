His second Christian name is wrongly given as John in DNB. Apprenticed for two years with James Baker Pyne in Bristol; a Member of the Bristol Sketching Club. Exhibited 17 works at the RA between 1833 and 1845, 14 at the BI 1840-45, and ten at the SBA 1836-40. Travelled extensively, making drawings which he used later for finished and exhibited paintings: seven months in Germany, Switzerland and Italy with the watercolourist George Fripp 1834-5, Greece, Egypt, Malta and Naples 1838-9, and Turkey 1843-5. Suffering from a heart condition, he died young in Bristol 8 September 1845. His studio sale was at Christie's 1-3 April 1846, and his work achieved high prices for some years after. A sketchbook and several watercolours are also in the V&A collections. \nLIT: \tArt Union 1845, p318 (obit); Art Journal 1864, pp293-5; N Solly Life of William James M\u00fcller 1875; C Bunt The Life and Work of William James M\u00fcller Leigh-on-sea 1948; William James M\u00fcller Bristol City Art Gallery exhibition catalogue 1962; there was an exhibition of M\u00fcller's work at the Tate Gallery 1985, but no catalogue seems to have been published. \n\nLandscape with a Horseman\n531-1882 Neg 52960 \nCopper, 14.6 \u00d7 20.3 cm (5 \u00be \u00d7 8 ins) Signed 'W M\u00fcller' bl \nJones Bequest 1882\nAccording to Solly, M\u00fcller imitated the work of various old masters, and in this case, particularly in the windswept trees, it may be compared with works by Jacob van Ruisdael such as the 'Entrance to a Forest' of 1653 (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam; repr in W Stechow Dutch Landscape Painting of the Seventeenth Century 1968, fig 139) which M\u00fcller could have known through prints or copies. The work probably dates from the early 1830s. \n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
