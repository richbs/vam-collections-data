Many of these wares have moulded or carved decoration which is often, as in this case, quite restrained.\n \nThis piece is one of the luxury items produced by Iranian potters. In the 16th century, ceramic production in Iran was on a modest scale. When the capital moved to Isfahan around 1600, the production of luxury dishes and wall tiles in a wide variety of styles and techniques rapidly increased.\n\nWe cannot identify a particular centre of production of ceramic vessels. Surviving pieces illustrate the many techniques the potters used. These included underglaze painting and coloured glazes, and lustre, which was revived after 1650.",
