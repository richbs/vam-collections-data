He is Professor at the Seoul National University of Technology, Korea (Department of Ceramic Culture and Design). He has exhibited in several exhibitions in Korea and abroad including \"30 Years of Korean Contemporary Ceramics\", at the National Museum of Contemporary Art, Seoul and \"From the Fire: Contemporary Korean Ceramics\", 2004-2007, in the U.S.\n\nThe piece was made using two hand building techniques of coiling and slab work. The colour partly results from a black glaze combined with oxides and salt water. Kim's work expresses his idea on the dualism of human beings. \n\nThe piece was shown as part of the exhibition Tradition Transformed  (from 20 May to 3 October 2011 at the V&amp;A). Tradition Transformed   showcases the work of contemporary Korean ceramic artists who combine traditional methods with modern ingenuity and innovative techniques.", 
            "exhibition_history": "", 
            "bibliography": "The work is about dualism and multiplicity of the human mind. The artist is interested in examining the complex nature of human beings. It is believed that we present our emotion in a multitude of ways yet what we are intending to portray may not be what we are actually transmitting. This is because we are easily tempted and affected by situations that surround us. Despite their complex nature, human beings strive to balance out the inner self to find peace within. Disciplining and restraining emotions often distill our overwhelmed senses. The work symbolizes the human body as a vessel containing a multitude of emotions. The head, mouth, eyes, chest, hips have been simplified. Part of the work includes texture and other parts are left blank. This is depicting the dual nature of human beings. The work is made with clay slabs in combination with the coiling technique. The surface is treated with salt water, oxides and black glaze. Symmetry in the form signifies the tranquil state of the human mind.",
