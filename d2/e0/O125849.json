(some col.).\nExhibition catalogue\n<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, pp. 90, 96-104\nThe sketch-book full-bound in brown leather, with (broken) metal clasp.  The binding has recently been partly renewed.  For a leaf which was possibly detached from the sketch-book before it entered the Museum see No. 133.  Another, missing between the present pp. 24 and 25, was also removed before the book was received in the Museum, and its present whereabouts is not known.  The sketch-book was used in Essex and Suffolk between July and October 1814.  There are drawings on 58 pages of the sketch book.  Pages bearing inscriptions or scribbles without drawings, are not reproduced amongst the plates.  Unless otherwise recorded the inscriptions are evidently by the artist.\n\nInside front cover \nScribble. \np. 1 \nScribble. \np. 2 \nBlank. \np. 3 \nTwo sketches on one page. A man seated on a bank with a stick in his right hand, looking down. A group of three figures, perhaps two children watching a third who is fishing; inscribed below <i>Augt. 1. 1814.</i> \np. 4 \nBlank. \np. 5 \nFaint scribble. \np. 6 \nA distant view of Dedham: the church tower seen in the middle distance from a lane running downhill beside a steep bank with a tree growing on top; inscribed below on left <i>Augst. 9. 1814</i>. \np. 7 \nA church seen across fields under a cloudy sky; inscribed below on left <i>Augst. 9.1814.</i> (the same date as that on p. 6, which shows a distant view of Dedham, and probably also that on p. 19, which shows Stratford Church). \np. 8 \nBlank. \np. 9 \nClose-up study of dock leaves. \np. 10 \nBlank. \np. 11 \nEast Bergholt Church, seen from the north-east; inscribed below <i>23d Octr. 1814 Saturday morning. 9. o' clock</i>. The reading <i>Saturday</i> seems clear, but 23 October fell on a Sunday in the year 1814 (see note on p. 79 of this sketch-book). \np. 12 \nInscribed, probably not by the artist, <i>East Bergholt Church</i>; this inscription evidently refers back to p. 11. \np. 13 \nThe village fair at East Bergholt. A line of booths, with flags flying at either end and crowds of people, with trees and houses seen behind. (See also the oil sketch No. 101 [128-1888] and the sketch-book No. 121 [317-1888], pp. 85 and 87, for the fair at East Bergholt, which will have begun at the end of July.) \np. 14 \nInscribed, probably not by the artist (in reference to p. 13) <i>I think this is the Jubilee fete 1814.</i> \np. 15\nLandscape: a scene over a wide valley, probably Dedham Vale; plate 103 inscribed below on left <i>Augst. 1st. 1814.</i>.\nFaint wash over pencil. \np. 16\nBlank. \np. 17\nFaint scribble. \np. 18\nBlank. \np. 19\nThe east end of Stratford Church, seen over the churchyard wall, with trees on the left; inscribed below on left <i>Augt 9[?] 1814 Stratford</i>. If correctly read the date is the same as that on pp. 6 and 7, on the first of which is a distant view of Dedham. \np. 20 \nBlank. \np. 21 \nStoke-by-Nayland: the church tower seen above houses to the left of the village street; inscribed above with an almost illegible line ending ... <i>N. W.</i> (the view of the church is in fact from the north-west). (See also pp. 23, 24, 39, 40, 41 and 43) \np. 22 \nInscribed, probably not by the artist, in reference to pp. 21 and 23 <i>Stoke by Nayland.</i>\np. 23 \nTwo drawings on one page. Stoke-by-Nayland Church seen in a gap between trees and a cottage. Another sketch of the tower of Stoke-by-Nayland Church, seen closer at hand. (See also pp. 21, 24, 39, 40, 41 and 43) \np. 24 \nStoke-by-Nayland Church: inscribed below on right <i>10 Augt 1814. eving.</i> A similar view to that described first on p. 23. (See also pp. 21, 39, 40, 41 and 43) \nBetween pp. 24 and 25 a leaf was removed before the book came into the possession of the Museum. \np. 25 \nView, probably on the Stour, looking across a waterway with a barge, to fields with distant trees: a tree is seen on the nearer bank on the right and a man on horseback on the further bank. (See also pp. 48 and 51 for similar compositions) \np. 26 \nBlank. \np. 27 \nView over a winding waterway towards a squarish church tower: two trees are seen on the left and a bank with cows in the right foreground.  Probably a view on the Stour, perhaps looking towards Dedham.  (See also p. 59 for a similar composition) \np. 28 \nScribble. \np. 29 \nInscribed at top <i>Tattingstone 28[?]th Augst. 1814--</i>(see note on p. 33 of this sketch-book). A scribble below. \np. 30 \nBlank. \np. 31\nA woman holding a child, seated facing right, seen from behind.\np. 32 \nBlank. \np. 33 \nThe tower of Tattingstone Church, seen amidst dense trees, enclosed by a fence; inscribed below on left <i>Tattingstone 23d. Augst. 1814.</i>\u2022 \nConstable says in his letter of 28 August 1814 to Maria Bicknell that he had been staying for several days at Tattingstone Hall painting a new uniform for his portrait of Admiral Western (Beckett, II, pp. 130-1). \np. 34 \nBlank. \np. 35 \nThree sketches on one page. A view over Dedham Vale with sheep in a field in the foreground. The two poplar trees and the bushier trees in the foreground identify the scene as Dedham Vale, seen from a viewpoint nearer than that in Sir Richard Proby' s painting 'Dedham Vale'. A flock of sheep huddled together; inscribed below <i>Augst 28. 1814-E[ast] B[ergholt]-Morning-.</i> Tree stems and hurdles on sloping ground. \np. 36 \nThree sketches on one page. A windmill, and on the left a repetition of the sails; inscribed below <i>23d. Sepr.</i> Two sketches of men digging; probably drawn at the dunghill seen in the 'Stour Valley and Dedham Village' in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (see note on p. 81 of this sketch-book) . \np. 37 \nA gable-ended house or mill on the left beside water and on the right and in the distance trees reflected in the water; inscribed below after an erased number [perhaps 29] <i>29th. Augst-1814</i>, and illegibly inscribed in top left corner. \np. 38 \nView over fields with a windmill prominent in the middle distance; inscribed below on left <i>22d. Sepr. 1814</i>. This is the middle distance of the scene from an upper window in Golding Constable's house (cf. No. 176 [623-1888]). \np. 39 \nStoke-by-Nayland: the top of the church tower seen above trees, with the east end of the nave visible above and to the right of a gable-ended cottage; inscribed in top right corner <i>Augt. 30 1814.</i> The later water-colour in the British Museum No. L.B. 34 appears to be based upon this sketch, though the tower of the church is shown at a slightly different angle. (See also pp. 21, 23, 24, 40, 41 and 43 of this sketchbook and the note on No. 330 [150-1888])\np. 40 \nStoke-by-Nayland Church, seen from the south; inscribed faintly below <i>Stoke</i>. (See also pp. 21, 23, 24, 39, 41 and 43) \np. 41 \nStoke-by-Nayland Church, seen from sloping ground and partly obscured by trees; inscribed below on left <i>Stoke Augst. 30. 1814</i>. (See also pp. 21, 23, 24, 39,40 and 43) \np. 42 \nTwo drawings on one page. A small landscape with a windmill in the centre. A sketch of a carved escutcheon. \np. 43 \nThe tower of Stoke-by-Nayland Church, seen above trees. (See also pp. 21, 23, 24, 39, 40 and 41) \np. 44 \nScribble. \np. 45 \nScribble. \np. 46 \nA workman kneeling on his left knee, seen from behind\nP: 47 \nA winding river with a boat in the right foreground and a windmill in the middle distance, seen against a cloudy sky; inscribed at top right <i>Sepr. 3d 1814 Saturday noon</i> [or <i>morng</i>]. \np. 48 \nA slight sketch of water-meadows, with a tree or trees on the right; probably a view of the Stour. (See also pp. 25 and 51 for similar compositions) \np. 49 \nA water-wheel. \np. 50 \nA water-wheel with a hanging chain behind it and the water trough in front right; inscribed at top right <i>11 Octr</i>-and vertically on the left <i>Gs-lift</i> [? or <i>left</i>]-<i>E[ast] B[ergholt]-12th-Octr-1814</i>. \np. 5 1 \nTrees by water, with a faint indication of barges and of a man on horseback on the left. This sketch is a variant of the composition on p. 25 and comparable with that on p. 48; these drawings were probably made on the Stour. \np. 52 \nView on the Stour, taken from the bank below Bridge Cottage and Flatford old bridge. Probably used as a sketch for the oil painting 'View on the Stour near Dedham' (now in the Huntington Library and Art Gallery, San Marino). (See also the sketch-book No. 121 [317-1888], pp. 27, 29 and 53 and Nos. 297, 298 and 324) \np. 53 \nA post with studs and indications of water flowing past it; probably a detail of a lock. \np. 54 \nFive sketches on one page. Two men loading a cart which has a horse in the shafts. An identical cart seen from the same angle, but with two horses, is to be found in the oil sketch No. 134 [333-1888], dated 24 October 1814. To the right of them is a smaller repetition of a similar horse and cart. A sketch of a labourer standing with a spade is superimposed on the horse and cart first described. An indistinct sketch of clothes, spades etc. lying on a bank.  A slight sketch of a cart and horses. \nAll these sketches were drawn at the dunghill seen in the 'Stour Valley and Dedham Village' in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (see note on p. 81 of this sketch-book). \np. 55 \nA number of slight sketches of figures. Probably <i>en suite</i> with pp. 56 and 57, in which case the top sketch at least is of men engaged on boat-building. \np. 56 \nA number of slight sketches of men engaged on boat-building; that of the seated boy, below on right, was used by Constable in 'Boatbuilding near Flatford Mill' (No. 137 [F.A. 37]) and those of the cauldrons and the ladle, below on left, resemble those in the painting and on p. 57 of this sketch-book. \np. 57 \nStudy for the oil painting 'Boat-building near Flatford Mill' (No. 137 [F.A. 37]); inscribed at top left <i>Sepr. 7. 1814. Wednesday.</i> The arrangement of the figures differs in the completed oil-painting, into which the seated boy from p. 56 of this sketch-book is introduced. (See also p. 55 of this sketch-book and the note on No. 137 [F.A. 37]) \np. 58 \nFaintly inscribed, probably not by the artist, in relation to p. 57 <i>boat building.</i> \np. 59 \nView of a winding river with barges in the right foreground, trees on the left, and a squarish church tower in the distance.  Probably the river Stour, looking towards Dedham. (See also p. 27 for a very similar composition) \np. 60 \nTwo sketches on one page. Two men digging in a dunghill. This is a sketch of the scene in the left foreground of 'The Vale of Dedham' in the City Art Gallery, Leeds (L. ed. S., Pl. 51), which is dated 5 September 1814. The painting at Leeds is itself connected with the 'Stour Valley and Dedham Village' in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (see note on p. 81 of this sketch-book). Above, a thumbnail sketch of a windmill. \np. 61 \nView along the towpath of the Stour looking towards F1atford Mill; inscribed below on left <i>14 Augst 1814</i>.  This sketch is related to the central section of the oil painting 'F1atford Mill' (Tate Gallery, No. 1273) (L. ed. M., p. 410). In the sketch-book No. 121 [317-1888], p. 10 is a drawing of the foreground trees from a different viewpoint (see also No. 161 [256-1888]). \np. 62 \nView over Dedham Vale, with the church tower in the middle distance and trees throwing long shadows in the foreground; inscribed vertically on the right <i>26 Sepr morning 1/2 8 o'cl</i> [?]. The drawing shows the valley from a viewpoint near to that in 'The Vale of Dedham' in the City Art Gallery, Leeds (see note on p. 81 of this sketchbook). \n\np. 63 \nView on the Stour: probably the lock at F1atford Mill seen from the weir below the confluence of waters, with part of the mill buildings visible on the left. The scene may be compared with the oil sketch No. 103 [135-1888] and the oil painting 'F1atford Mill' (Tate Gallery No. 1273) (see also Nos. 104 [325-1888] and 300 [242-1888]). \np. 64 \nWater escaping from a sluice: a detail of that shown in the foreground on p. 63. \np. 65 \nView over Dedham Vale. The angle of vision is similar to that on p. 81, and may be compared with that on p. 62. On the left Constable has started to block in a tree as an inserted element of the composition, which is connected with that of the 'Stour Valley and Dedham Village' in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (see note on p. 81 of this sketch-book). \np. 66 \nA house and thatched boat-shelter at a confluence of the Stour. A sketch for the leftward and central section of 'The White Horse' (Frick Collection, New York). Mayne (L. ed. M., p. 410) records an oil study which follows this sketch fairly closely. (See also pp. 69 and 70 for studies apparently of the same scene from different viewpoints) \np. 67 \nA thatched cottage on the right, with trees beyond it to the left over plate 113 which a crescent moon is rising; inscribed vertically on the right <i>Sunday. eveng. Sepr. 18th. 8 o'clock.</i> The moon and its halo are touched in with white. \np. 68 \nFour drawings on one page. A plough. A distant sketch of a team of horses. A wide valley landscape. A close view of two horses harnessed to a cart, with trees in the background; inscribed below on left <i>Octr. 1. 1814.</i> \nThe plough in the first sketch is also to be seen on p. 69 of this sketchbook and in the oil sketch No. 136 [789-1888], which is dated 2 November 1814. The sketch of the horse and cart is one of the series discussed in the note on p. 81 of this sketch-book. \np. 69 \nThree sketches on one page. A plough superimposed on a fainter, whole page drawing of a landscape, with a house on the further bank of a river with trees to left and right of it. A faint sketch in the vertical sense, at top left, perhaps of a horse and cart. \nThe details of the whole page landscape are not clear, but the house in the centre of the composition may be that seen on pp. 66 and 70 of this sketch-book, and the composition itself may be connected with the series discussed in the note on No. 403 [141-1888]. The plough is the same as that seen on p. 68 of this sketch-book, and the oil sketch No. 136 [789-1888] of 2 November 1814 represents it from an identical viewpoint. \np. 70 \nA scene on the Stour: figures on the nearer bank, a barge in the river and a group of buildings on the further bank which may be compared with those seen on p. 66 (drawn from a different position) and on p. 69. \np. 71 \nInscribed <i>28 Sepr. 1/2 past 8 o'clock James</i> [ ... ] [the surname illegible] (see also the inscription on p. 72). \np. 72 \nMoonlight scene: a figure walking along a road flanked by the ruined tower of East Bergholt Church on the left, and a cottage and trees on the right; inscribed below <i>28 Sepr. \u00bd</i> [ ... ] <i>8 o'clock</i> (see also the inscription on p. 71). \np. 73 \nThree sketches on one page. A man loading a cart, to which two horses are harnessed, seen from the rear. A dog lying down. A bird's-eye view of a bend on a river, with a barge rounding it. The sketch of the horse and cart is one of the series discussed in the note on p. 81 of this sketch-book. \np. 74 \nFour sketches on one page. Men loading a cart with a horse in the shafts seen from behind.  Above, a slight sketch, probably also of a horse and cart in profile. Stratford St. Mary Church; inscribed above <i>Stratford 5 Oct eveng.</i> Superimposed on this, a girl wearing a bonnet and seen from the side.\n The horse and cart in the larger sketch on this page is seen at the same angle in the oil sketch No. 135. For the relation with the painting 'Stour Valley and Dedham Village' in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, see the note on p. 81 of this sketch-book. \np. 75 \nView of a field, with a road in the foreground winding past a clump of bushes and trees on the left, and a windmill in the distance; inscribed below on right <i>6. Oct. 1814.</i> \np. 76 \nBlank. \np. 77 \nTattingstone Church seen from the south-east; inscribed at top right <i>Tatingstone. S.E. 19. Octr. 1814-.</i> \np. 78\nTattingstone Church: a closer view of the porch and tower seen from the same angle as in the sketch on p. 77; inscribed below on right <i>19\u2022 Octr. 1814.</i> \np. 79 \nTwo drawings on one page. A view at Stoke-by-Nayland over a wooded valley towards a distant ridge on which the church tower is seen; inscribed below on left with deletion as shown <i>Stoke Oct. 23d. 1814. Saturday morning</i> [struck through] <i>noon</i>. A nearer view of the same ridge. Writing to Maria Bicknell on 25 October, Constable said that he had intended writing to her on the Sunday \"when the beauty of the day (which perhaps might be the last this autumn) tempted me to take a walk to Neyland to pass the day with my poor Aunt, who is now a great invalid. My way was cheifly through woods and nothing could exceed the beauty of the foliage\" (Beckett, Il, p. 134). The reading <i>Saturday</i> seems clear, but October 23, in fact, fell on a Sunday in 1814 (see also p. 11 of this sketch-book). \np. 80 \nBlank. \np. 81 \nView of Dedham Vale; inscribed below on right <i>9th Octr-</i>. This drawing is a sketch, made under conditions of pronounced light and shade, for the oil painting 'Stour Valley and Dedham Village' in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Beckett (<i>Burlington Magazine</i>, Vol. XCVIII, 1956, p. 18 and reproduction) has identified the painting at Boston as the work commissioned from Constable in 1814 as a wedding present for Miss Philadelphia Godfrey, and has established the connection of the sketches Nos. 134 [333-1888] and 135 [332-1888] and of the painting 'The Vale of Dedham' in Leeds Art Gallery with the Boston picture. A letter from the author of this Catalogue in the <i>Burlington Magazine</i>, Vol. XCVIII, 1956, p. 132, also drew attention to the connection of drawings on <i>pp</i>. 36, 54, 60, 62, 65, 68, 73, 74 and 81 of this sketch-book, either with the finished painting, with the oil sketch at Leeds or with the preliminary sketching which Constable carried out near the dunghill which is seen in the foreground of the composition. Of all this preliminary material, p. 81 is nearest to the picture at Boston, since it shows the dunghill and the valley from almost the same viewpoint, has a tree in the left foreground and a horse and cart (though seen in profile). The heap in the foreground, described as a gravel-pit in the first edition of this Catalogue, has been identified by Mr. Ian FlemingWilliams as a dunghill (<i>Burlington Magazine</i>, Vol. CXIV, 1972, pp. 386-93). \nThe Leeds oil sketch is dated 5 September 1814 and No. 134 [333-1888] below is dated 24 October; accordingly Constable was working on the details of the painting over a period of at least seven weeks. \n\np. 82 \nThe porch of East Bergholt Church, showing the sundial and a tree and a cottage beyond; inscribed at top <i>Saturday 17th Sepr, 1814. E[ast] B[ergholt]</i>. \np. 83 \nA small sketch of a woman carrying a child. Also on the page are figures relating to standard sizes of canvases: \n\n<i>Half length \n{40 by 50 Inches\n4 by 5- \n\nThree quarters \n{25 by 30 Inches\n 25 by 31 1/4- \n{20 by 24\n20  25- </i>\np. 84 \nA long inscription on this page has been erased. Inside back cover. Inscribed <i>Colchester Ju [ ... ] 1814 \n{5 feet 2-Inches \n4 do by 4 do \nMr.</i> [ ... ] (the name almost illegible, perhaps <i>Mason</i>; see note on the sketch-book No. 121 [317-1888], p. 78). \n\nNOTE ON THE SKETCH-BOOK NO. 132 \nThe drawings in this sketch-book were made by Constable during his summer and autumn visit to East Bergholt, during which he stayed at his parent's house from 30 July until 4 November. The progress of his engagement with Maria Bicknell was particularly discouraging at the time, and Constable admitted to a tendency to become a recluse. His subjects, to judge from those which are identifiable in the sketchbook, were drawn mainly from the neighbourhood of his home. Besides the extensive material connected with the' Stour Valley and Dedham Village' enumerated in the note on p. 81, this book contains the full-page composition sketch for 'Boatbuilding near Flatford Mill' of 1815 (No. 137 [F.A. 37]  below) and figure studies made in connection with that composition (pp. 55, 56, and 57); a drawing (p. 61) related to 'Flatford Mill' (Tate Gallery); a drawing used for 'The White Horse' of 1819 (Frick Collection, New York) and another connected with it (pp. 66 and 70); and the original sketch (p. 52) for 'View on the Stour near Dedham' of 1822 (Huntington Library and Art Gallery, San Marino). Three river scenes with tall trees in the foreground, right, are on pp. 28, 48 and 51; two with tall trees in the foreground, left, on pp. 27 and 59. The latter may have contributed to the formation of the final composition of the 'View on the Stour', and the faint full-page sketch on p. 69 was possibly used in building up the Stour scene discussed in the note on No. 403 [141-1888] of this Catalogue. The many sketches of Stoke- by-Nayland Church (pp. 21, 23, 24,39,40, 41 and 43) may have been referred to by Constable when he was varying the composition of his mezzotint 'Stoke-by-Nayland' (S. 9); and that on p. 39 was used by him as a sketch for the later water-colour 'View at Stoke-by-Nayland' in the British Museum (No. L.B. 34). \nThe dated pages in the sketch-book, with place-names where known, or with brief descriptions of subject, are: \n\nEnd of July:  p. 13:  The fair at East Bergholt. \nAugust 1:  p. 15:  Dedham. \nAugust 1:  p. 3:  A group of three figures. \nAugust 9:  pp. 6, 7:  Dedham. \nAugust 10:  p. 24:  Stratford.
