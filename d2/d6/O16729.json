This sketch was made as a preparation for a large picture, which was exhibited at the Royal Academy and is now in the Royal Collection.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nSome months after her coronation in June 1837, Queen Victoria posed for this portrait.  It shows the Queen dressed in her coronation robes and kneeling at the altar in Westminster Abbey.  Even this small sketch reveals Leslie's skill as an artist who was able to combine the intimate and the historic in a single scene. This point was reinforced by the fact that the Queen later commissioned him to record the christening of her first child, the Princess Royal.\n\nHistorical Associations\nThe Coronation of the young Queen Victoria was the founding moment of a new era in British life. The Hanoverian Kings (particularly George IV) who had preceded her became unpopular because of their perceived vice and folly. A significant section of the population was being enticed towards the thought of a republic. The youth and innocence of Victoria represented a new start for the monarchy to some of her more moralistic subjects.",

Apprenticed to a publisher 1808, received a few lessons in painting from Thomas Sully. A subscription was raised to enable him to study art in Europe; returned.to London 1811, entered RA Schools and studied with Benjamin West and Washington Allston. Visited Paris 1817 with Allston and Wilkie Collins, met G S Newton, with whom he visited Brussels and Antwerp. Also friend and biographer (published 1843) of John Constable. Exhibited 76 works at the RA between 1813 and 1859, and 11 at the BI 1815-32. Some were portraits, but most were his much admired literary subjects, particularly drawn from Cervantes, Moliere, Shakespeare and Steme. Elected ARA 1821, RA 1826. Several of his works were engraved, and he made six illustrations for Sir WaIter Scott's Waverley novels 1824. Worked for six months as drawing master at West Point Military Academy, New York State, 1833. Professor of Painting at RA 1848-52; his lectures were published as a <U>Handbook for Young Painters</u> (1855). His <u>Life of Reynolds</u> was finished by Tom Taylor and published 1865. Died St John's Wood, London, 5 May 1859. An exhibition at the RA of  30 of his works was held winter 1870. His two sons, George Dunlop and Robert, were also artists. The <u>Athenaeum </u>critic (9 May 1846, p480) wrote that he was 'unrivalled for the certainty of his powers, the <i>wi</i>t of his pencil, the deep knowledge of human nature as exhibited in the more ordinary scenes of life'.\n\nLIT: <u>Art JournaI</u>1856, pp73-5 and 105-7, 1859, p187 (obit); C R Leslie <u>Autobiographical Recollections</u> ed T Taylor, 2 vols, 1860; J Dafforne <u>Pictures by C R Leslie </u> nd [1875]; <u>Art ]ournaI</u>1902, pp 144-8; J Constable <u>The Letters of John Constable and C R Leslie</u> 1931; ed R B Beckett John <u>Constable's Correspondence</u> III, Ipswich 1965 \n\n<b>Queen Victoria in her Coronation Robes</b> \nFA129 Neg 59256 \nCanvas, 45.7 X 61 cm (18 X 24 ins) \nSheepshanks Gift 1857 \n\nA sketch for the large (94 X 185.4 cm/37 X 73 ins) painting 'Queen Victoria Receiving the Sacrament after her Coronation' exhibited at the RA in 1843 (74) and now in the Royal Collection. The Coronation took place on 28 June 1838; in July the Queen 'heard that Leslie contemplated a Coronation picture. She sat to him in November, 1838, and December ... The picture was finished early in 1839'. But, according to a letter of 16 June 1839 quoted in <u>Leslie</u> (II, p253), the picture was not yet finished; it is recorded as completed in a letter of 19 December 1839. Leslie described the Coronation in a letter to his sister of 24 July 1838, quoted in <u>Leslie</u> II, pp237-9 but incorrectly dated to 1837. \nThe RA catalogue gave details of the subject and the principal figures; these were amplified in C Collins Baker's <u>Catalogue of the Principal Pictures in the Royal Collection at Windsor Castle</u>. The painting was engraved by S Cousins in 1843. The <u>Athenaeum</u> (20 May 1843, pp492-3) thought the picture: \n\nMust rank as History, but it is unavoidably History treated in the <i>genre</i> style. The difficulties of the subject have been met, and in great part overcome, with taste and judgement, and the profile of the Queen is one \nof the best likenesses we have seen of Her Majesty; the colouring beautiful, bright and harmonious - colour is one of Leslie's excellencies. \n\nThe <u>Art Journa</u>l (1843, p163) thought: \n\nThe merits of this picture place it among the highest of its class; the artist has succeeded in wrapping the scene in a holy interest \u2026an appropriate effect is produced by a beam of light which descends towards the altar. . . the figures of the young Queen and her maids of honour are as graceful, ideal, and beautiful as the most poetic fancy could desire\u2026\n\nThe present work<i> is</i> a sketch for the figure of the Queen kneeling at the alter in Westminster Abbey. The beams of light admired by the <u>Art Journal</u> illuminate the altar and the figure of the Queen, a device used later by the photographer Cecil Beaton; Leslie suggests the Divine Right to the throne. and perhaps the presence of God at the moment of Holy Communion. \n\nAccording to Collins Baker, it was Lord Melbourne who introduced Leslie to the Queen, 'emphasising his superiority to [Sir George] Hayter: \n\nEXH: <i>Exposition Universelle</i> Paris 1855 (867, lent by Sheepshanks) \nLIT: (the RA picture) <u>Leslie</u> I, pp165-71, II, pp244-45;<u> Dafforne</u> pp6-7\n\n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
