His Portraits of Many Persons of Note fills three volumes with nearly 200 portraits and comprises a pictorial Who's Who of late Victorian and Edwardian celebrities. Alfred Hutton was an accomplished swordsman who devoted himself to the practice of modern fencing with foil, sabre, and bayonet, but chiefly to the study and revival of older systems and schools. He was also one of the founders of the Central London Throat and Ear Hospital in 1874, and was its first chairman for thirty years.",
