The centre front and wing fronts, all of which open, are lined with handblocked wallpaper showing stags and figures among trees. \n\nThe layout of this wardrobe shows pre-19th-century usage. There is no horizontal rail from which to hang clothes. The larger garments such as cloaks and jackets and the skirts of dresses hung on pegs in the central space. The other items lay flat in the drawers and on the shelves.\n\nA similar piece dated 1709 and known as \u2018Mr Joy\u2019s Surprise\u2019 indicates that Edmund Joy was the maker and not the owner of this piece. The fa\u00e7ades of both houses bear a considerable resemblance to Kew Palace in west London, a building formerly known as \u2018The Dutch House\u2019.",
