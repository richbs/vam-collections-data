The style of the robe is quite old-fashioned, and based on the 17th-century mantua.\n\nDesigns & Designing\nThe shell, the quintessential Rococo motif, constitutes the basis of the embroidery pattern.  Leafy scrolls, latticed arcades and tassels are also featured, as well a profusion of realistically rendered flowers, including jasmine,  morning glory and honeysuckle, peonies, roses, poppies, anemones, auriculas, hyacinths, carnations, cornflowers, tulips and daffodils. The pattern of the silver shells and scrolls has been arranged symmetrically at the hem, but the layout of the flowers, while balanced, does not match exactly on either side.  This ensemble recalls a garment worn by the Duchess of Queensbury in 1740: 'her cloathes were embroidered upon white satin; Vine leaves, Convulvus and Rosebuds shaded after Nature ...'.\n\nMaterials & Making\nSeven panels of ivory-ribbed silk make up the petticoat. The robings, sleeve cuffs and skirt of the mantua are embroidered in the same design, but were modified to fit their exact proportions.\n\nThe flowers are worked in a variety of coloured silks in satin stitch and french knots.  Silver thread delineates the leaves and the non-floral components of the pattern.  Some of the scrolls and border elements have a backing of parchment, for solidity and regularity of line.  The tassels and bases of the shells have been thickly padded underneath. Varying the height of the padding under the embroidery of the silver leaves gives the surface of the stitching a rippled effect.",

The photograph was inscribed \"Caroline Mary Walwyn, in the dress of Isabella Courtenay who was married 14th May 1744 in the Cathedral of Exeter\". It was probably not the actual wedding dress, but could have been specially made for the bride's first Court appearance as a married woman.",
