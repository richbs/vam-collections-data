This image, Surveillance is based on a photographic view of people in the street presented as if it were the blurred and flickering image on a CCTV screen. He has exploited this illusion of an electrical-optical sensation in his paintings and his prints as means of bringing in the qualities of video. It also has a visual quality that it is very characteristic of contemporary city experience, now that so many public spaces (at least in western cities) are overlooked by surveillance cameras.\n\nHe has used a painstaking traditional print technique - etching - to produce an image which appears to be the output of an electronic or digital medium.",
