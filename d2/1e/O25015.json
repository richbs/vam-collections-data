In her role as Durga Mahishasuramardini, \u2018slayer of the demon Mahisha\u2019, Durga saves the male gods and the universe from defeat. The worship of Durga images can be traced as far back as the Kushan period (1st century CE \u2013 320 CE), with surviving images being found at Mathura in North India dating to this period. The first textual accounts of Durga killing the buffalo demon are later, among them the Devibhagavata PuraNa (5th to 7th century CE) and the Devimahatmya, provisionally dated to the 8th century. In these texts, her independent and fierce nature is clearly apparent. \n\tAlthough often considered a form of Siva\u2019s consort Parvati, Durga \u2013 the inaccessible - is rarely depicted in a domestic setting, or even with a male consort. Instead Durga is typically realised as a dynamic warrior goddess, defeating all before her. Both sculptures represent the final moment of the battle between Durga and Mahisha, a powerful demon, who takes the form of a buffalo and is invincible to all but a woman. Durga, however, was created from the fierce energy of the male deities and endowed with their weapons. Spurning his offers of marriage, Durga finally slays the shape-shifting Mahisha by cutting off his buffalo head and striking the emerging demon with a trident given to her by Siva. \nThe small terracotta image was probably made for a small domestic or wayside shrine, whereas the larger stone example came from a temple. Both show Durga towering over the other figures, with \u2013 especially in the later sculpture - a calm, detached expression, belying any connection with the violent events taking place. \nThe terracotta plaque, made at a time before the iconography of the episode had fully crystallised, shows a four-armed Durga killing the buffalo with her trident, while pressing its neck down with her foot and lifting it by the tail. Her upper hands hold a bell and an unidentified weapon. The buffalo appears to be excreting in death, a touch of sordid realism.\nIn the 13th-century sculpture, Mahisha has resumed his human form and rises out of the buffalo\u2019s hide, only to be speared by Durga. Her multiple arms surround her, holding a selection of weapons and framing the central figure. The lavish embellishment of this sculpture, such as the scrolling decoration in the arched surround and the heavy jewellery she wears, is typical of the HoysaLa dynasty (11th-14th centuries), generous patrons of the arts who ruled much of what is now KarNaTaka. \nThe worship of Durga is still a major part of the Hindu festival calendar, with a large series of rituals being held in her name. Durga Puja, held in the autumn months, involves the creation of large images of the goddess vanquishing the demon. These images are worshipped throughout the festival, which culminates in the submergence of the images in nearby rivers, lakes, ponds or tanks. \n\nCam Sharp Jones and Nick Barnard",

The Slazenger family purchased the Powerscourt Estate from the Wingfield family in 1961. The 7th Viscount Powerscourt  (1836-1904) described in his history of the house how he acquired two pieces of Indian sculpture while on a sporting tour in the state of Mysore in 1861. He relates how he asked Captain Johnston, who accompanied him on this tour and was at the time the Commissioner of Irrigation for Mysore, 'to get me a specimen or two of these beautiful works of art and he sent me these two [IS.76 and 77-1965, Surya and Durga] saying that he had persuaded the Brahmin in charge of the temple to allow them to be taken away'. Lord Powerscourt thought that they probably came from Halebid, but their provenance remained unrecorded. John Guy recognised close parallels with the sculptures at Sadsiva Temple, Nuggihalli, south-east of Halebid.",

The Hoysalas established their capital at Halebid early in the 11th century and endowed many major temples in southern Karnataka. Their flamboyant sculptural style derived from the late Calyuka traditions and flourished throughout the 12th and 13th centuries.",
