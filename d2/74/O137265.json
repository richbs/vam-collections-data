The abstracted fish form is created with a raised \"fin piece\" on the blade and a \"tail piece\" attached on the underside of the handle with threaded rods and rivets. The brilliant hues of the enamel work form a magnificent display of artistry and technical skill.  Techniques of baisse taille, depletion gilding and champlev\u00e9 (transparent enamel) were used to create a fantastically vibrant and luminescent design of blues and greens. The scale patterning of the blade is exaggerated on the handle unifying the two portions. The roughly chased texture of the fin piece beautifully offsets the smooth enamel of the blade and handle. Overall the elegance of form and the splendour of the enamel design create a beautifully rich piece.",
