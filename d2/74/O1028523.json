The next picture, in order of date, is the \"Notre Dame,\" and was painted in 1836, either, therefore, during a second visit to Paris, or from rough sketches made during the earlier one. It is specially interesting becasue, apart from the faithful and beautiful delinieation of the cathedral's remarkable fa\u00e7ade, the old block of building once standing nearly in front of it, which consisted of the H\u00f4tel Dieu as well as the ancient houses of the Rue St. Christophe, and which disappeareed about 1882, are shown on the left hand...\nRoundell, James <u>Thomas Shotter Boys 1807-1874</u> London: Octopus Books, 1974.\nThe book depicts an 1832 watercolour of Notre Dame by Thomas Shotter Boys and then goes on to make reference to this later work:\n\nBoys copied this watercolour four years later, creating a very different mood. Whereas the washes here are measured and controlled, in the later version the treatment is wetter and more violent, the washes in the sky giving the effect of a storm. The washes have a sepia tone and there is heavy overdrawing, also in sepia. The figures too are altered, with two stretcher-bearers moving towards the hosptial at the left, adding a note of local colour. \nStephen Duffy, <u>The Discovery of Paris.
