She is dressed in a sari with a bindi on her forehead to emphasise her traditional character. In the bottom left hand corner is  the  full figure image of the film star Raj Kapoor as the simple country boy/ vagabond character. He wears a hat, carries all his possessions in a cloth bundle tied to a stick swung over his shoulder and is gesturing to show that he has empty pockets. This image of Kapoor has since become one of the most famous in Indian cinema history. A row of modern buildings in the middle ground  separate the two figures and serve to indicate the narrative dilemma of the film: the main theme juxtaposes the rich but corrupt urban society against the  warm-hearted rural poor.  The titles are on the bottom left  corner and the Raj Kapoor film studio logo is in the top left hand corner.\n\nBoth Nargis and Raj Kapoor are immediately recognisable and first appeared together in the highly successful film Awara (1951) in which Raj Kapoor played a tramp. In Shri 420 he revives this role and the vagabond costume in which he is seen in this poster  not only identifies his role in this film but also conjures up associations with his role in Awara. This image is particularly important because it refers to one of the most famous Indian film songs of all time: ' Mera Joota hai Japani..' In this song he says that while he is dressed in an odd assortment of clothes from around the world his heart and soul is still Hindustani.",
