            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nHouses designed by C. F. A. Voysey (1857-1941) were like large, idealised country cottages. Their unornamented furniture (generally made of oak like this table) reflected the informality of the rooms. This table was made by the London firm of F. C. Nielsen, which also made other furniture designed by Voysey.\n\nDesign & Designing\nVoysey's contemporary, the architect M. H. Baillie Scott (1865-1945), wrote, 'If one were to sum up in a few words the scope and purposes of Mr Voysey's work, one might say that it consists mainly in the application of serenely sane, practical and rational ideas to homemaking'. Here, Voysey has eliminated all metal fixtures: the components are simply wedged together. The original design for this table, dated 1903, is in the Royal Institute of British Architects' Drawings Collection, London. An inscription on the drawing refers to a house in Buckinghamshire called Hollymount, built by Voysey in 1905-1906.\n\nPlaces\nWhere did this table come from? A photograph of the living room at Hollymount shows a similar table. However, around the same time Voysey remodelled a house in Chelsea, London, for the politician E. J. Horniman. Photographs of rooms in this house also include tables of this design. We cannot be sure whether this table is one of those included in these photos.",
