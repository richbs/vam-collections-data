At either end of the panel the front face is cut back about 3 mm, for a width of about 1.5 cm, as if to fit into some kind of socket.  This face of the panel is stained red.  The back is unstained and undecorated, but carries a carved graffiti date of 1854, and the accession mark in both pencil and chalk. The front face is marked '18' in chalk. The back is fitted with three mirror plates, one at the centre at the top, and one at each side on the lower edge.",

In Iceland, beds were built into the structure of the house, as in many rural communities throughout Europe.  Bedboards were loose planks that could be placed across the entrance to the bed to keep bedclothes in place.  For this reason, they only needed to be decorated on one face.  They were often carved by members of the family, or as a present from a young man to his future wife. During the day, they were hung flat on the wall, to form part of the decoration of the house.  In Iceland, the traditional carved motifs of scrolling plants and interlaced patterns continued in use until after 1850.  At that time they were given a new lease of life by the Arts and Crafts movement, led by the enthusiasm of the British designer William Morris for such traditional Icelandic folk-art. This bedboard is carved with the monogram 'SID', presumably for the original owner.",
