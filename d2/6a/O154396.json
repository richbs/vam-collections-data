The handle consists of two square rods of uneven length, 4mm on each side, that pass through the apron and are tied together by a spiral roll of approximately twenty-four-gauge silver sheet and held by a gold pin. The apron pass-throughs are strengthened by the application of two small sixteen gauge (1.3 cm) squares on the back of the apron. The blade and apron are scratch brushed and the handle rods are randomly sharp brushed.",
