The series shows ladies's dresses designed by six leading Parisian couturiers of the time - Jeanne Paquin, Ernest Raudnitz, Madeleine Laferri\u00e8re, Gustav Beer, Jacques Doucet and the House of Rouff. Each lithograph is printed with its designer's facsimile signature.\n\nThis design is for an evening dress designed by Madeleine Laferri\u00e8re (1847-1912). Laferri\u00e8re, who opened her couture house in Paris on the rue de Taitbout in 1869, is one of the first female haute couturiers to have enjoyed enduring success. She created gowns for European royalty, including Queen Maud of Norway and Princess Alexandra of Wales. Although Jeanne Paquin (1869-1936) is often credited as the first internationally famous female couturier, this is a claim challenged by Laferri\u00e8re who also enjoyed widespread recognition and was regularly ranked as an equal to Paquin and Doucet.",
