Graz is the capital city of the Austrian state of Styria. The panels formed part of a series of windows depicting episodes from the life of the Virgin Mary.  The church was consecrated in 1353 and it is believed that this series of windows dates from that time.

It is assumed that they were removed from the church during restoration work in 1885.\n\nThey were acquired by the Museum with assistance from the National Art Collections Fund in 1930.\n\nTwo other panels from this series of the Life of the Virgin Mary are in the Kuntsgewerbemuseum in Vienna and others are in the Joanneum in Graz (apparently), the Metropolitan Museum in New York, and in Kiev.",
