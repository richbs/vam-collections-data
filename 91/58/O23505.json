Although this type of dress has all but disappeared in China and would not have been seen by Sir John Addis after the mid-1950s, it is still worn at important clan rituals in the New Territories of Hong Kong. The material, dating between 1900 and 1940, was probably made up especially for Sir John in the 1950s. It is the right size for him although it is unlikely that he ever wore it. There is no sign of wear and such a luxurious robe would have been inappropriate at the time."

The lining does not appear to be traditionally tailored, there being a deep facing of velvet around some of the edges under which the silk lining is caught. Also untraditional are the addition of a 'breast pocket' of matching blue velvet sewn onto the inside section of the robe, and a black loop 'hanger' sewn across the back of the neck. \nThere is a small paper shop label stuck to the inside top right of the gown.",

It is a man's robe, of a type that, in the first decades of the 20th century - and, in fact, right up to the end of the 1940s - was frequently worn with Western-style trousers, leather lace-up shoes and a velour trilby hat.  This example has an all-over pattern of small crane roundels, which appear dark against a paler ground because they are formed by the dense, cut pile of the velvet.",
