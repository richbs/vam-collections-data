The ceiling to be all of the best Wainscot or English oak, thoroughly seasoned; the ribs to have butt joints. \n<i>Pencil, pen and ink and water-colour.</i>         E.5095-1960 \n\nGiven by Mr. H. B. Johnson \n\n<i>Note:</i> The restoration of Jesus chapel was carried out by Bodley, 1864-7, and correspondence in the archives of Jesus College shows that the nave ceiling was in progress in 1866-7, the work being carried out under the direct supervision of William Morris.  This preliminary design, which differs considerably from the work as completed, is probably Bodley's own project and, according to information supplied by the donor, the drawing formerly bore a note which ascribed it to Bodley.\"",
