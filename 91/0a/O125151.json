ISBN: 0642541566.\nExhibition catalogue.\n<i>Catalogue of the Constable Collection</i>, Graham Reynolds, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1973, cat. no. 122, pp. 90-92\nThe following is an extract from the text of the entry:\n\nThe <i>verso</i> is thinly painted with a now much discoloured sketch of a row of houses in a village street. (No. 122a [144-1888] is on the original front of the panel; No. 122 [144-1888] is painted on the rough unprepared underside, which has bevelled edges. \nThe sketch No. 122 [144-1888] was engraved by David Lucas for <i>English Landscape Scenery</i> (S. 7). A row of notches at intervals of approximately 1 inch along the top and a corresponding row along the bottom are evidently traces of the engraver's squaring. Shirley (S.: L., pp. 164-5) says that the plate was probably begun by September 1829; it was published in the first number of <i>English Landscape Scenery</i>, June 1830. In different lists of plates the mezzotint appears under the titles 'Spring. East Bergholt Common' (1830 edition) and 'Spring. A Mill on a Common. Hail Squalls' (1832 edition). Leslie (L. ed. S., p. 4) remarks that the windmill in the engraving 'Spring' is one of those in which Constable worked as a young man, and that \"its outline, with the name of John Constable, 1792', very accurately and neatly carved by him with a penknife, still remains on one of its timbers\". Lucas also made a smaller mezzotint of the same subject (S. 52), which was published as an illustration in the second edition of Leslie's <i>Memoirs of the L!fe of John Constable</i>, 1845, facing p. 5. Constable subsequently composed a long text for publication with the engraving, with quotations from his favourite poets. Shirley (S.: L., pp. 249-55) gives seven different drafts of it, and Leslie (L. ed. S., p. 5) gives a somewhat abbreviated extract. The text makes it clear that this sketch embodied Constable's feeling for the spring. He expatiates upon the variety of colours to be seen in the early part of the year, making a point of controverting the theory that the autumn only is the painter's season. He also dwells upon what he calls the \"natural history of the skies\"; and his remark that a certain type are called by \"wind-millers and sailors 'Messengers' \" helps to reinforce the view that it was his early training as a miller which focused his attention upon cloud forms. \nIn style and subject matter No. 122 [144-1888] belongs to the period <i>c.</i> 1809-16. Holmes (p. 243) suggested that it was a sketch for the landscape which Constable exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1814 with the title 'Landscape: Ploughing scene in Suffolk'. The hypothesis advanced in the first edition of this catalogue that the exhibit of 1814 was in fact the composition mezzotinted by David Lucas as 'A Summerland' (S. l0) has been substantiated by the discovery of a version of that work, now in the collection of Mr. and Mrs. Paul Mellon. This comes from the collection of John Allnutt, and is reproduced, with a discussion of the two versions which Allnutt acquired from Constable, in <i>Constable Oil Sketches</i> by John Baskett, 1966, Plate 13 and p. 44. In his article 'A Runover Dungle and a Possible Date for \"Spring\" (<i>Burlington Magazine</i>, Vol. CXIV, 1972, pp. 386-93) Ian Fleming- Williams gives reasons for adopting the date 1816 for No. 122. \nThe version of No. 122 in the Louvre (No. 1810a) is a copy from Lucas's mezzotint: it faithfully reproduces the rooks which were added by Constable during the proof stages of the engraving (see P. M. Turner's article in the <i>Burlington Magazine</i>, Vol. X, 1906-7, p. 342). A pen-and-ink sketch of a windmill formerly in the collection of Major P. W. Leggatt (Windsor, reproduced facing p. 16) is connected with the engraving of the subject. Lucas (Windsor, p. 6) records \"This blot of the Windmill has reference to the engraving of 'Spring' or 'The Mill on East Bergholt Common'. It was done to explain the altered shapes of the vanes in their different positions ... \". The sketch however was made purely as a demonstration, and it bears only a rough resemblance to the windmill as engraved.",
