            "public_access_description": "Edward Pearce, the designer of this series, was one of the leading British artists of the Baroque style in his day. As a contemporary and associate of Inigo Jones, he worked particularly on interior decoration. This series of frieze designs reflect Pearce\u2019s taste. Originally published in 1640, this edition is a posthumous reproduction from 1668, ten years after the artist\u2019s death. Like Jones, Pearce believed that buildings should be constructed with strong, masculine exteriors and rich, elaborate interiors. This mix of architectural and florid design is evident throughout the frieze series. Putti drape themselves across bundles of fruit alongside solid architectural frames. During Pearce\u2019s career, Richard Symonds praised him for having the best grasp on perspective of any British artist of the day. This too is evident in the series, and through attentive shading and positioning of various decorative elements, Pearce creates a sense of depth, even in a limited space.",
