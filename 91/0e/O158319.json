Most theatres in the 19th century would have had some made to mark grand openings or milestone performances. By the end of the First World War however the practice had generally died out, only being revived very occasionally,  more often at London's opera houses than any other theatres.\n\nThis silk playbill was produced to mark the grand opening night of The London Hippodrome on 15th January 1900. Featuring a wide range of circus and variety performances, it set the Hippodrome's programme for years to come. Performances often included large scale aquatic acts, with the theatre space containing a 100,000 gallon water tank used in performances such as the Amphibious Burletta, Giddy Ostend, or, the Absent-Minded Millionaire, as seen on the opening night.",
