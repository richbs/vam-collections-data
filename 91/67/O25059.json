The inner face of this stone is finely carved in low relief with female figures alternating with tripartite flowering stems, evoking the Buddhist \u2018triratna\u2019 symbol. The quatrefoil lozenge pattern is also seen on the Buddha\u2019s \u2018vajrasana\u2019 throne seat at Bodhgaya. There it suggests a textile-inspired design. \n\nIt has been suggested that ring stones may have served as moulds. Goldsmiths might have used them to produce ear ornaments, such as those seen on \u2018yaksha\u2019 (nature-spirits) figures of this period and of a type which continued into the Kushan period (1st-3rd century AD).\n\nRing stones have been recorded across northern India, from Taxila in the north-west, the Punjab, to Patna in the east. They share a uniformity of materials and of design and a consistently high quality of carving. This, together with their portability, raises the possibility that they were produced in one centre and circulated as a form of luxury good along the early northern trade routes. A strong candidate as a production centre must be Pataliputra (modern Patna), the capital of the Mauryan kingdom of Magadha.",

The uniformity of the material and the designs, together with the portable nature of the objects, has led scholars to suggest the possibility of one centre of production from which they would be sold as luxury merchandise along the  major trade routes of northern India. A probable centre for this production was Pataliputra (modern-day Patna), the capital of the Mauryan state of Magadha. Their purpose remains an enigma. The female figures may be symbolic of a fertility goddess.  The tri-partite flowering plant may evoke the <i>tri-ratna</i> Buddhist symbol, while the square patterning bears a resemblance to the motifs on Buddha's throne pedestal at Bodhgaya.",
