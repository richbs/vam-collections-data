The fronts of ancient temples were given porticoes made of columns topped by triangular pediments. Architects since antiquity have studied importnat classical prototypes. This tomb in the shape of a temple is one of a series of models of Greek and Roman architecture shown by the architect John Nash in the Gallery of Architecture at his house in Regent Street. Visitors were clearly meant to link the great buildings of the past with Nash's own improvements to London. By 1858 Nash's models were being shown at South Kensington, eventually joining the Museum of Construction. The main source for this model was Robert Wood's illustration in The Ruins of Palmyra, published in 1753.",
