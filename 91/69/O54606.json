It is jointed at the neck, shoulders, elbows, wrists, waist, hips, knees and ankles. The joints are all metal. There are small metal attachments for the strings on the head, back, upper arms and thighs, with holes in the hands for similar attachment. The only remaining string is a small piece still attached to the right hand. The figure wears a sleeveless and backless green chiffon dress, the skirt of which is cut into strips and has further strips of purple netting. The body of the dress, in particular the lower part, is decorated with beads of different colours and small artificial flowers and leaves all encased in a fine netting. The legs and feet are bare. The facial features are boldly carved and painted with orange lips and green eyes. The hair is lime green thread and is decorated with a band of leaves and flowers.",
