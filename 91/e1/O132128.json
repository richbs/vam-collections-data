Chorister in Chapel Royal, entered RA Schools 1821, winning gold medal 1824. In a long and successful career, exhibited 83 works at the RA between 1823 and 1879, 39 at the BI 1824-44, and eight at the SBA 1825-34. Early pictures were portraits and historical subjects, but following success of 'Rebels Shooting a Prisoner' (showing children at play) 1827, specialised in similar scenes, and of school and village life, comparable to those of Wilkie and Mulready. Influential and much admired, they became popular through engravings. Elected  ARA 1840, RA 1846, and Honorary Retired RA 1876. \nContributed illustrations to the Etching Club's 'Deserted Village', 'Songs of Shakespeare' and 'Etch'd Thoughts' (1841-4). Moved to Cranbrook, Kent, 1856; senior member of the Cranbrook Colony of painters. Died Cranbrook 23 September 1886; his studio sale was at Christie's 21 May 1887. \nLIT: Art Journal 1855, pp293-6, 1862, p138, 1866, pp40, 330, 1886 \npp351-2 (obit); Athenaeum 2 October 1886, p439 (obit); The Times 24 September 1886 (obit); DNB\n\nChildren at Prayer\n 573-1882 Neg G581 \nPanel, 49.5 X 59.6 cm (l9\u00bd X 23 \u00bd ins) \nSigned and dated (the date is indistinct) 'T. Webster 1835' bl Jones Bequest 1882 \nThe painting does not seem to have been exhibited. A painting titled 'Children at Morning Prayer' was in the William Llewellyn sale at Foster's 4 April 1855 (71, size given as 24 X 20 ins (which could be width before height), bought by the dealer Gambart), and could be the present work. It has been suggested, however, that the painting is more likely to be an evening scene and therefore possibly a pendant to the Llewellyn picture; on the other hand, evening prayers are more likely to be said by the children in their night-clothes. \n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
