            "public_access_description": "The inro is a container made up of tiers. Japanese men used them because the traditional Japanese garment, the kimono, had no pockets. From the late 1500s onwards, Japanese men wore the inro suspended from their sash by a silk cord and a netsuke (toggle). They originally used it to hold their seal and ink or a supply of medicines. However, it rapidly became a costly fashion accessory of little or no practical use. Most inro are rectangular with gently curving sides. This example is decorated with poppies in multi-colour togidashie (brought out by polishing) lacquer. This technique produces a surface that is completely flat.\n\nLacquer was most commonly used in the manufacture of inro since it was highly suitable for storing medicines. Lacquer is the sap from the tree Rhus verniciflua that grows mainly in East Asia. After processing, it is applied in many thin layers to a base material.  The craft of lacquering, as well as making inro bodies, is highly complex, time-consuming and expensive. \n\nFrom the 1700s onwards, many artists signed the inro they made. This example is signed Toshihide. The name was used by a pair of brothers who worked at the end of the 1700s and early 1800s. Whereas Toshihide I preferred working in the takamakie (high sprinkled picture) lacquer technique, Toshihide II, the younger brother, specialised in togidashie lacquer.",
