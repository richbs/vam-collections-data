Sk\u00e5ne province, in the extreme south of Sweden, has the richest tradition, and more jewellery was worn there than in any other district.   Almost all the Swedish traditional jewellery at the V&A comes from Sk\u00e5ne.  \n\nCircular and heart-shaped ring brooches are medieval in origin and were found throughout northern Europe.  They differ from modern brooches in the way they fasten.  The wearer pulls the cloth of the garment through the central hole, and then spears it with the pin.  The greater the strain on the pin, the more secure the fastening.\n\nThis ring brooch is a plain circle decorated with filigree coil rings, each topped with a flattened granule.  This kind of decoration is typical of Sk\u00e5ne work in the first half of the 19th century, as is the little ring holding the pin.  It was made to hold a woman\u2019s shirt closed at the collar.  The mark is unclear, but is probably that of Gabriel Thulin, who made traditional jewellery in Halmstad in southern Sweden from 1817 to 1858.  His widow continued to use his mark after his death, until 1864.",
