            "physical_description": "The painting, in opaque watercolour on paper, shows a standing lady in profile facing right holding a pink rose up to her face in her left hand and a cluster of other pink flower-heads in a leaf bowl cupped in her right hand. She stands on a stretch of green grass dotted with a variety of flowering plants with a fringe of grass stems silhouetted against the pale green ground which rises up towards the top of the painting. Here an arching band of  pale orange  brushed with pale gold suggests a sky with dusk approaching that blends into a band of dark blue at the top. Puffy clouds have been indicated by a wash of white applied when the paint beneath was damp. Flocks of  birds in the distance can be seen among the clouds.\n\nThe original painting has been extended at both top and bottom by the addition of  bands of paper, 1.5 cms and 2 cms deep respectively.  These have been painted to extend the picture in a cruder manner with a band of blue sky and puffy clouds applied in white paint with splodges of grey and some additional birds.  The strip at the bottom has been painted to represent a pond with flowering water lilies and two little grey fish rising to a jagged dark green margin with  clumps of spiky pale green grass.  The dark green paint has been crudely brushed over the join with the original painting. \n\nThe lady wears a golden <i>ghaghra</i> (skirt) ornamented with a half-drop pattern of pale-coloured tulips and a gold spotted band of pink at the hem.  Over this she wears a transparent gold-spotted red sari with a golden trim to the edge.  It is tucked into the waist of the <i>ghaghra</i> with two black and gold tassels at the front from which falls a gathered central portion making a visual red panel down the front.  The sari is worn round the back and over her head, covering most of her upper body and falls over her left shoulder to another tasselled end below her waist.  Under this she is wearing a tight gold-spotted yellow <i>choli</i> with short sleeves with a golden band at the edge.  The <i>choli</i> ends just underneath her breasts with the seams  trimmed in gold, exposing her bare midriff.  Her feet are shod in yellow and red striped slippers dotted in gold.  Her fingers and thumbs are be-ringed and painted red.  She also bears red cosmetic spots on the exposed palm of her left hand.  She wears lavish pearl jewellery as a hair ornament, earring, a nose ring and double rows round her neck and wrists.  She is wearing further gold necklaces, one with a pendant pearl and green gemstone and a double chain which falls beneath her breasts and a shorter one with gold pendant 'jasmine buds'. Above her pearl bracelets she wears a jewelled gold band and series of gold bangles. Her hair falls loose down her back and a few stray strands are shown curling over her ear.\n\nThe painting has an inner mount with a golden flower scroll on a pinky-orange ground outlined in gold and white lines with two fine black ink outlines and an outer blue one.  This is mounted on an outer ivory-coloured border ornamented  with a row of alternate pink lilies and red poppies outlined in gold. The margins of the page have blue-green strips of collaged paper with a white outline. An additional strip of grey paper has been added to the inner edge of the page where the previous margins have been mostly obliterated as a binding gutter for the album, but there still remain remnants of the blue-green margin which appears to have been pasted over a red painted one.",
