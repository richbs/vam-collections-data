It was used to consume a much wider range of drinks than the 'small beer' (a weak, poor-quality beer drunk in place of water) of previous generations. In silver, a number of new styles, as well as revived designs, were added to the variety of mug shapes and patterns.\n\nTrading\nThe silver trade specialised in presentation and commemorative pieces during the Victorian period. Smith & Nicholson, who made this mug, showed presentation silver at the Great Exhibition. Similar mugs  may have been shown on their stand, as examples of  souvenirs of the highest quality, and may have been sold to the wealthiest of the exhibition's visitors.\n\nHistorical Associations\nThe mug commemorates the Great Exhibition of 1851. It is engraved with a design of the Crystal Place, which housed the exhibition. The Crystal Palace was designed by Sir Joseph Paxton (1801-1865), a horticulturalist, garden designer and architect. Erected in Hyde Park, London,  it covered 18 acres and was built from sheet glass, wood and metal. When opened to the public on 1 May 1851, it received great praise. As one of the most innovative and impressive buildings of its day, it was a fitting subject for commemorative wares.",
