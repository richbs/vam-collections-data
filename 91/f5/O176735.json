The workmanship demonstrated on this figure is of the highest quality as illustrated by the fine details of the figure: the delicate fingers and toes, the draping folds of the robe and the combed hair. \n\nGuanyin (Skt. Avalokitsevara), Bodhissatva of compassion was one of the most popular figure subjects made at the Dehua kilns during the Ming (1366-1644) and early Qing (1644-1911) periods. Guanyin came to be incorporated into Chinese religious life, art and material culture as an important figure in the Buddhist pantheon and was the focus of devotional practices aimed at individual salvation. Guanyin was also worshipped as a protector of mariners and as a bringer of sons. This figure would most likely have been for domestic use and worshipped on a small household altar.",
