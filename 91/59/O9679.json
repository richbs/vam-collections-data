            "public_access_description": "This painting is the right side of a double-page composition by the Mughal court artist La\u2019l from the Akbarnama (Book of Akbar). It depicts wild elephants being driven into the fort at Bayanwan in the province of Narwar in central India, where a tank of water had been dug on the orders of the Mughal emperor Akbar (r.1556\u20131605). The right side of the composition, Museum no. IS.2:43-1896, illustrates the digging of the tank.\n\nThe Akbarnama was commissioned by Akbar as the official chronicle of his reign. It was written in Persian by his court historian and biographer, Abu\u2019l Fazl, between 1590 and 1596, and the V&A\u2019s partial copy of the manuscript is thought to have been illustrated between about 1592 and 1595. This is thought to be the earliest illustrated version of the text, and drew upon the expertise of some of the best royal artists of the time. Many of these are listed by Abu\u2019l Fazl in the third volume of the text, the A\u2019in-i Akbari, and some of these names appear in the V&A illustrations, written in red ink beneath the pictures, showing that this was a royal copy made for Akbar himself. After his death, the manuscript remained in the library of his son Jahangir, from whom it was inherited by Shah Jahan.\n\nThe V&A purchased the manuscript in 1896 from Frances Clarke, the widow of Major General John Clarke, who bought it in India while serving as Commissioner of Oudh between 1858 and 1862.",
