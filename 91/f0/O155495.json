Spilsbury, Picturesque Scenery In The Holy Land And Syria, Delineated During the Campaigns Of 1799 and 1800, 1803, Plate 20, entitled The Grand Vizier's Tent.\nSee Abbey (381) for description of the volume published 1803; plate numbers given follow the numbering in that copy.  See also SP.564 for a second edition (1819).  The lettering on each plate states that they are after drawings by Daniel Orme from Spilsbury's on-the-spot sketches.  SD.998:1-19 are clearly not Spilsbury's first-hand sketches, but may be the drawings he prepared for the engravers, with the addition of three hand-coloured etchings/engraving.  While they (including the etchings/engraving, if he was indeed the author of The Art of Etching and Aquatinting) may represent a further stage executed by Spilsbury himself, it is just possible that they comprise the set drawn by Daniel Orme for publication.  Orme (c.1766-after 1832) was a portrait painter in oils and miniature and an engraver.  He studied at the RA Schools and worked in London, exhibiting at the RA 1797?1801, until 1814.  He was probably the brother of Edward and William Orme, also artists and engravers. (See DNB and Hardie, III, p.44.)\nIn 1799 Napoleon laid siege to Acre but in May was repulsed by the Turks with the aid of the British fleet commanded by Sir William Sidney Smith.  Afterwards Spilsbury participated in various reconnoitering trips made by British officers into Syria and Palestine: see text of Picturesque Scenery ....",
