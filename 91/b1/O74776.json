Japanese metalworkers had perfected ways of decorating iron and steel in a style quite different from the traditional forms in Europe. Jeckyll successfully incorporated favourite Japanese motifs such as the sunflower in his drawings for stoves and ornamental ironwork. The full-size design of 'sunflower panes for lower brackets' was for part of an ornamental pavilion. This was in the main building of the International Exhibition held in 1876 in Philadelphia, USA.  It was also shown at the International Exhibition, Paris, in 1878. This design is part of a set that has survived in fragments.",
