He worked for the decorating firm of Lenygon & Morant which designed interiors in the 1950s and 1960s. The garden pavilion was for Gainsborough House, Winnington Road, Hampstead London. It was designed for the owner, Louis Speelman. The plan beneath shows the seating arrangement in the interior of the pavilion and its situation in the garden. The presentation drawing is for the client. The plan appears to have been added afterwards onto the mount of the design perhaps to provide further explanation to the client.\n\nIn addition, the bottom of the mount bears the name of the antique dealers, 'H. Blairman & Sons'. This firm and the decorating one of Lenygon & Morant collaborated on interior design during the 1950s and 1960s, integrating new d\u00e9cor and antiques for clients. It is likely that such interiors were done for this client.",
