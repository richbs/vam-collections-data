The design, a cross with fleur-de-lys inside a quatrefoil, is based on contemporary gold coins such as the <i>masse d'or</i> of Philip IV le Bel (1285-1314). On one side of the chalice are thick accretions suggesting it lay for many years half submerged in liquid. The stem has very clear decorative rings, formed by turning the stem on a lathe and placing a sharp tool against it.",

            "public_access_description": "Traditionally, priests, abbots and bishops were buried with symbols of their office to identify them at the Last Judgement. Crosiers, chalices, mitres and rings have been found in ecclesiastical graves. It was common practice from at least the 11th century for out-of-date silver chalices or substitutes in base metals, generally pewter, to be used as grave goods. A note (now lost), formerly attached to the foot of this chalice and copied to the Museum acquisition register translates as: \"pewter chalice found in 1832 at Verdun in the tomb of Etienne Bourgeois, Abbot of St. Vanne, who died 24th March 1452.\" It was probably old when buried, and from its style may be perhaps 100 years earlier.\n\nIn 1229 the Bishop of Worcester declared that all churches should own two chalices, one in silver for use during the celebration of the Mass, and the other in tin, to be buried with the priest. Eight out of nine 13th-century graves searched in Lincoln Cathedral in 1955, (in a vain attempt to find the body of Hugh of Avalon, Bishop of Lincoln from 1181-1200) contained pewter chalices and patens. \n\nBurial chalices were possibly simple representations of the priest's holy office. However, they may also have had a more literal symbolism. A manuscript, the Mitral by Sicardus Bishop of Cremona (died 1215), records that the \"chalice [signifies] the body, because wine is in the chalice, blood is in the body\".\n\nThe use of pewter in a church context has been debated since early medieval times. Was it appropriate to use a non-precious metal for sacred purposes? The Council of Reims in 803 was the first recorded body to sanction its use but only for churches that could not afford silver or gold. The Synod of Rouen, in 1074, reinforced this option when expressly forbidding the use of wooden vessels. The Council of Westminster in 1175, however, instructed that only vessels of silver or gold should be consecrated. For many churches, precious metals were simply too expensive and pewter was substituted.\n\nUntil about 1400 churches provided the principal market for pewter, although sepulchral chalices are still rare survivors of the medieval pewterer\u2019s craft and, as they are usually untouched, are often have details in reasonable condition.",
