The detail is clear enough to see the wood grains and slate of which the roof is made. There are two figures in the photograph, both in the midground, one is a European, possibly Dr G.R. Playfair who was accompanying him on this journey, and the other is a villager.

Viewed from the veranda of the bungalow, the range of snowy peaks forms an unbroken line for about 90 per cent of the horizon, and in fine, clear weather is a grand sight. But alas! The sight was not for us. During our stay of two days a dense mist hid all the glories from our anxious gaze, or, if it cleared off for an instant, it only revealed a bank of clouds piled up as a second and higher range of peaks on the top of and concealing the real one.'",

Viewed from the veranda of the bungalow, the range of snowy peaks forms an unbroken line for about 90% of the horizon, and in fine, clear weather is a grand sight. But alas! The sight was not for us. During our stay of two days a dense mist hid all the glories from our anxious gaze, or, if it cleared off for an instant, it only revealed a bank of clouds piled up as a second and higher range of peaks on the top of and concealing the real one.'\n\nBourne, S, A Photographic journey through the Higher Himalayas, The British Journal of Photography, November 26 1869, pg 570.",
