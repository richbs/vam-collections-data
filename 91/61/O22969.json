It was drawn by Ashbee's friend, Fleetwood C. Varley.  This sketch was reproduced in the German journal, Kunst und Kunsthandverk, and was possibly drawn especially for that purpose.\n\nPlaces\nThis house was designed and built by Ashbee for his family in 1893-1894.  The Ancient Magpie and Stump was the name of an old inn which had stood on the same ground. The rooms in the house were the first evidence of Ashbee's talents as an interior designer. The sketch shows the remarkably austere dining room, with its narrow guild trestle table and ladder-back chairs. It was decorated only with a modelled plaster frieze, partly painted by Ashbee's daughter Agnes, and a side-board displaying blue and white porcelain. The house was demolished in 1968.\n\nPeople\nAshbee founded the Guild of Handicraft in 1888. It was a school and subsequently became a business based on Arts and Crafts principles.  It practised woodwork, leatherwork, metalwork and jewellery-making. The guild supplied much of the  decoration for this dining room including what were then revolutionary ultra-modern electric light fittings.  In 1907 the business failed, mainly because it could not compete with ordinary commercial firms, especially Liberty's in London.",
