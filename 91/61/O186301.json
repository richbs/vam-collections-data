He gave up a brilliant academic career to fight for the rights of the masses. He led a battalion of the National Guard from Belleville until their dispersal after the Hallowe'en revolt and after that his own private band of <i>tireurs</i>. This caricature shows him tossing Favre, Thiers and Picard in the air while trampling on Trochu. During the attempt to overthrow the Government on 31 October he is said to have marched, imperious and magnificent, up and down the conference table disdainfully scattering the members of the Government of National Defence. He was brutally killed by the Versaillais' troops at Rueil on 3 April.
