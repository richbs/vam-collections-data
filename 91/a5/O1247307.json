The figures were bought in 1937 and are mostly made by the master puppet maker Arthur Quisto (1882-1960).\n\nMr Punch was first recorded in England in 1662 by the famous diarist Samuel Pepys when he saw him as a marionette, operated in Covent Garden by the Italian puppet showman Signor Bologna. Pulchinella, as he was then called, was presented within a tent rather than in the type of booth we know today. Pepys brought his wife to see the show two weeks later and that October the same show was performed at Whitehall for the King. \n\nIn the Punch and Judy show written by Professor Bavister the Policeman comes to see what all the noise is about after Mr Punch has been fighting with the Doctor and has knocked him out. The Policeman says he has the authority to arrest Punch, to which Punch replies that he has the authority to knock him down, which he duly does before sweeping him off the stage.",
