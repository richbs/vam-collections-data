The latter is designed to be held with two hands and given the weight of Shah Tahmasp's sword, and its poor balance in its present form,  it seems likely according to Allen (Hunt for Paradise, 2003) that it was designed as a two-handed weapon, and that it originally had a much longer hilt. \n\nThe inscription on the back of the sword contains the lineage of Shah Tahmasp. The historical texts attest to various different geneologies for Shah Isma'il, and thus for the Safavid dynasty but this is the most common version, taking his lineage back to the Shi'ite Imam Musa al-Kazim, and by implication back to the Prophet's son-in-law, 'Ali, and to his wife Fatima, the prophet's daughter.",
