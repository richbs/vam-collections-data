            "history_note": "This sideboard was designed by Ern\u00f6 Goldfinger for the north London home of Mr and Mrs Benroy, 1 Graham Road, Hendon.  It was one of three sideboards made for the dining room (the second was identical and the third similar but twice the size ie 4 drawers wide instead of 2).  Mrs Evelyn Benroy later lived in a flat in St John's Wood where she continued to use this sideboard and other furniture from Graham Road until her death in 1988.  Black and white photographs of the Graham Road interiors show the position of the larger sideboard, but there is no record of the location of the two smaller ones.  It is curious that on the pr side of the V&A example the marble facing is in two sections, and on its pair, now in the Wolfsonian Institute, Miami, the marble is in two sections on the pl side.  This could suggest that the two pieces were originally fitted around some architectural element in the room.\n\nMr Benroy was Ern\u00f6 Goldfinger's stockbroker and one of a number of friends/clients for whom Goldfinger designed interiors in the 1930s.\n\nObject sampling carried out by Jo Darrah, V&A Science; drawer/slide reference 7/80.",
