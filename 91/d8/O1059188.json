The locket was probably fitted to the miniature in the Museum; there is no record of the original, but the worm hole suggests that it, or at least its backboard, was wooden.",

Full Citation:\n\n\"<b>102 Lady Katherine Dormer</b>\n(d.1659) \n<b>c.1658</b> \nP77-1935 \n\n<b>Oval 81 X66mm</b> \n\nFeatures in brown and sanguine, hatched diagonally with grey-blue shadow and some white heightening in the eyes and lips, on a pale carnation ground; hair in pale brown wash, hatched with darker colour and some gouache for the lights, also over the carnation; dress in blue wash with pale gouache lights; chemise in thick white shaded with grey; pearls in thick white impasto over grey; background a pale brown wash, heavily hatched with darker colour; on vellum put down on pasteboard. \n\n<b>Condition:</b> A worm hole centre right; much flaking especially of the impasted whites, also some of the more heavily gummed brown passages; a zinc-white retouch in the sleeve and retouches in the face and the dress. The original line of the sitter's bosom, before correction by the artist, shows in the background to the left. \n\n<b>Signed:</b> Not signed. <b>Inscribed: </b>in ink, on the back: <i>my Lady K Dorme[r] / picter done by mr / gibsone.</i> \n\n<b>Frame:</b> Twentieth-century double-sided locket of gilt-brass, the straight sides with a Single torus moulding, holding the flat glasses by their bevelled edges in bezels; the hanger of square section with a deep channel, bifurcating into uneven spirals of three and four turns. The locket was probably fitted to the miniature in the Museum; there is no record of the original, but the worm hole suggests that it, or at least its backboard, was wooden. \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> Bt from Miss AJ Shears, Slough, Buckinghamshire, November 1935. \n\n<b>Exhibited:</b> NPG 1974, no. 201 . \n\n<b>Literature:</b> Reynolds 1952, pl. XII, fig. 32; Whinney and Millar 1957, p. 97n.; Foskett 1972, vol.I, p. 287 Ca signed miniature'), pl. 124, no. 332 (as by 'Dirck Gibson'}: Foskett 1979, p. 123; Summary Catalogue, 1981, p. 24; Murdoch and Murrell 1981, pp. 283-4, fig. 6; Murdoch 1981, pp. 129, 219; Reynolds 1988,p. 77. \n\nClosely similar to a portrait attributed to Lely and seen by Long in the Constitutional Club, St James's, said to represent Lady Caroline Dormer; the miniature is presumably a copy of it. The miniature is of special historical significance because it was bought by Long for the Museum after he had corresponded with Captain C M H Pearce of Ripley Court, Surrey, about the identity of the artist D G, whose monogram appeared on the back of Pearce's <i>Sir Richard Anderson</i> of 1658.(1) Long had connected the monogram with the entry in Vertue, (2) which identifies it as that of ' Gibson the limner' , and when Lady Katherine Dormer turned up, clearly by the same hand and with the old inscription identifying the artist as Mr Gibson, he regarded the separate existence of a miniaturist called D Gibson as established. He was, however, puzzled by the stylistic evidence, for this suggested to his eye an excessive proximity between the 'new' D Gibson and the Richard Gibson whose work Goulding, and Long himself, had already described. Goulding had even pointed out the 'diagonal striations on the flesh' as characteristic of Richard Gibson, and they are of course extremely evident on the Lady Katherine. Had Long lived until the publication of Vertue VI in 1951-2, he would have seen the answer to the puzzle, the careful transcription of the DG monogram followed by the unequivocal statement: 'the Mark of Dwarf Gibson as on a limning of his doing'. (3) \n\nIt was Long who worked out who the sitter was. He first assumed it to be Catherine, the daughter of Edmund Fettiplace of Swincombe or Swinbrook in Oxfordshire, who married Charles, 5th Baron Dormer, in 1668 and lived at Wing in Buckinghamshire. Long felt that this was substantiated by the geographical coincidence with other Gibson portraits painted at 'Ascott (Bucks) and Pendley'. Subsequently he thought it 'much more probable' that the sitter was Katherine, the third daughter of Montague Bertie, 2nd Earl of Lindsey, by his first wife, who died in 1641. Katherine Bertie married Robert Dormer (d. 1695) of Dorton, Buckinghamshire, the son of Sir Robert Dormer, Kt, of Chearsley, Buckinghamshire, and Duns Tew, Oxfordshire. She was buried at Long Crendon, Buckinghamshire, on 9 June 1659. \n\nThe Buckinghamshire connection is important. Including both candidates considered by Long, it shows both the family and the geographical ties operating in Gibson's circle of patrons at this stage of his career. \n\nCharles Dormer, Catherine Fettiplace's husband, became Baron Dormer after the death of his cousin, Charles Dormer, 2nd Earl of Carnarvon (d.1709) released the barony (but not the earldom, nor the viscountcy of Ascott) to the collateral branch of the family. The barony passed firstly to Charles' elder brother Rowland before coming to him on the latter's death in September 1712. But Catherine Fettiplace, who was married in 1668 and was dead by 1694, was never entitled to be called Lady Catherine Dormer: her husband was the son of a knight and was not a baron until 1712, when his then wife became known as Lady Dormer. \n\nKatherine Bertie, on the other hand, though her husband was also the son of a knight, was herself the daughter of an earl, and was thus styled in her own right Lady Katherine. Her half-sister Mary, the daughter of her father's second marriage (to Bridget, <i>suo jure</i> Baroness Norreys de Rycote) was the second wife of Charles Dormer, 2nd Earl of Carnarvon. She lived at the Carnarvon seat at Ascott, like her predecessor Elizabeth, the Earl's first wife, whom Gibson painted at Ascott at the end of January 1657; in 1657 Mary was two years old, and in another two years Lady Katherine was dead.\n\nCharles, 2nd Earl of Carnarvon, also sat to Gibson at this time, and probably again later. The group of Dormer portraits suggests strongly therefore that Gibson was working fairly regularly for the family, painting not only the Earl and Countess, but their cousin Lady Katherine, her brother Peregrine Bertie, (4) and eventually the young Lady Isabella Dormer in 1671 (Cat. No. 109 [P.4-1966]).(5) \n1 Repro.
