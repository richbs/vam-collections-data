The panel was glad to be able to award the Prize for a product from an industry which often appears to pay less attention to the exterior than it does to the interior design in its goods.\n\nIn the early years the Council of Industrial Design tended to focus on the syling of audiovisual equipment, giving awards to products such as Eric Marshall's Rio Transistor Radio. Later technicald developments came to play a stronger role, showcasing the strength of British hi-fi design and manufacturing. (Crowther)",
