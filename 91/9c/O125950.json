The plaque was made some time from about 1790 to 1810 when pearlware plaques such as these were produced as popular cheap wall decoration.  A plaster mould was made initially, into which clay was pressed and from which at least a hundred and sometimes as many as two hundred plaques could be produced.  When dry, plaques were painted and fired at very high temperatures so that several colours could be fixed at once, dispensing with the need for subsequent painting and firing. Prattware was first produced by the firm of William Pratt of Lane Delph, later Fenton, an area of Stoke on Trent in Staffordshire.\n\nThe scene on the plaque would have been taken from a contemporary print.  The late 18th and early 19th century saw several productions of the play with popular stars depicted by print-makers, including that at Covent Garden in 1804 with Mrs. Siddons as Desdemona.",
