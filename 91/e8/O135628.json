            "history_note": "Given by Miss Maria Y B Forrester (born in France ca. 1872), then living at the Aban Court Hotel, Harrington Gardens, London SW7.   Acquisition RF 61/ 1508; transferred to F&W 02/12/1991 (RF 71/31670).  Miss Forrester wrote that her parents' house in Lexham Gardens was \"decorated by him [Morris] in person about 1879\" and that she \"can just remember [him] when she was about 6 years old as wearing an open collar, large black bow tie, & whose fingers were stained with indigo blue...I lost all my possessions in 1940, but still have my very small rush-bottomed Wm Morris baby chair\".  Her parents, William O Forrester, a sportswear shipper, and his wife Ysobel were evidently enthusiasts for Morris's designs, as when they moved to 43 Hans Place in about 1900 \"the rooms were again hung with Morris papers\".",
