After receiving an all round education, he studied art at Frankfurt under Steinle, and at Brussels, Paris and Rome. In 1852 he began to work independently and spent the next three years in Rome. \n\nLeighton's painting <u>Cimabue's Madonna carried through Florence</u> (1853-55) was his first major work, and an immediate success. When it was shown at the Royal Academy in 1855, it was bought by Queen Victoria. \n\nLeighton settled in London in 1859, though he frequently travelled abroad. His cosmopolitan knowledge of languages, literature and music marked him out as an exceptional figure in Victorian London, and he rose rapidly through the art establishment. He was elected ARA in 1864 and RA in 1868, and attained the Presidency of the Royal Academy in 1878. He was the most influential of the Victorian Classical painters, and an important exponent of the 'subjectless' painting associated with the Aesthetic Movement, in which pictorial narrative is suppressed in favour of beauty and atmosphere. Leighton died on 25 January 1896 and is buried in St. Paul's Cathedral.\n\nLeighton was in the habit of making rapid oil sketches during his travels to record buildings, landscapes and local characters. It is possible that this sketch was made during a trip to Egypt in 1868, when Leighton sailed up the Nile in a steamer lent by the Viceroy, Ismail Pasha, and visited Giza, Asyut, Koorveh, Memnonium and Philae, travelling as far south as Aswan (Christopher Newall, 'Chronology', in <u>Frederic Leighton 1830-1896</u>, London: Royal Academy of Arts, 1996, p. 95). Leighton appears to have used the study as the basis for the head of the elderly man in the background of the painting <u>Hercules Wrestling with Death for the Body of Alcestis</u> (1869-71; Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford, CT, USA; see <u>Frederic Leighton 1830-1896</u>, pp.168-9), although the direction is reversed.",
