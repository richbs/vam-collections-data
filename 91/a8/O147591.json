            "physical_description": "A carved and stained walnut chair, turned and carved, with its original seat and back covers of stamped leather, trimmed with large, simulated nails. The high back, raised above the canted seat, has a stepped arched top and an inversely -- but less steeply -- shaped bottom edge. Below the seat the legs are strengthened with three turned stretchers, at the back and sides, and with a carved front stretcher, its arching scrolled mouldings above a scallop shell echoing the top of the chair-back. \n\nMost of the frame is made of walnut, with the exception of the seat rails, which are oak, and the top and bottom rails of the chair-back, which are softwood (possibly pine). The leather seat cover is made from a single piece of stamped leather, which is wrapped under the seat rails.  Two small sections of the leather seat cover are also attached to the front face of the back uprights (just above the seat). The leather is trimmed with very large brass-covered pine domes, simulating spaced nailing; these are probably dowelled through the leather into the frame. The edges of the seat are trimmed with a separate strip of leather. The stamped leather chair-back cover is fixed to the front face of the back, and trimmed at the borders with a separate strip of leather. There are two similar, but non-matching, metal (probably iron) finials at the top of each back upright. All of the joints are tenoned, and the tenons of the side stretchers are stop-pegged in the legs.\n\nA build-up of polish is evident in the stamped leather.  Some kind of wash has also been applied to the front rail.  There is an extensive repair to the back left upright beneath the back bottom rail.  A large piece of the upright is missing at this point, and the section seems to have been strengthened by sliding a large (wooden?) plate into the gap.  Both front feet have been replaced, and wooden plates have been added to the back feet.  The back right foot has also been patched and filled. There is a (relatively new) cloth-covered board nailed to the back of the splat.",

It probably dates from much later, however, as it seems to be a response to a particular type of English chair, with caned seat and back, in a style that developed around 1715. English caned chairs were widely exported from London, from about 1670 up to the 1740s, to Europe, Asia and America, and they were also imitated in the centres that imported them. The English prototypes usually had a high arched top, repeated in a carved stretcher between the front legs. Most imitations were quite closely comparable to the originals, but the Portuguese responded in this much more idiosyncratic manner, replacing the carved and caned panels with embossed and incised leather. In this example the carved shell in the front stretcher is echoed by a shell embossed in the leather at the top of the chair-back, in a manner that recalls the English treatment.",
