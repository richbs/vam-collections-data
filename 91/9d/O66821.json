They once formed part of the private collection of English medieval glass of Grosvenor Thomas who gave the fragments to the Victoria & Albert Museum in 1915. Subsequently, the museum framed them up in this panel for study purposes.\n\nEngland had a rich tradition of stained glass in the Middle Ages but due to the political and religious upheavals of the 16th and 17th centuries, much survives only in a fragmentary state as you see here.\n\nThe fragment here depicts an ornate frog-mouthed jousting helmet of the type worn from about the end of the 15th century into the early 16th century. Although it is only part of what was an now unknown larger image, it is possible that it orginally formed part of someone's armorial display in glass. A full armorial 'achievement' consists of a coat of arms (a shield), on either side would be supporters (often in the form of wild beasts) and on top would be a helmet with a crown that would indicate the rank of the person whose arms are displayed. \n\nOther interesting fragments on this panel include a pig with a bell collar (Museum no. C.384-1915) and a bishop's mitre (Museum no. C.386-1915).\n\nThe majority of the fragments on this panel are painted on the reverse with silver stain which, when fired in the kiln, turns a yellow to orange colour. This technique of decorating window glass first developed around 1300. Many panels from the 14th and 15th centuries are decorated simply in yellow (silver) stain and highlighted with a brown/black pigment.",
