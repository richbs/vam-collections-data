The Illustration shows a garden at night symmetrically arranged with bushes and trees beyond a balustraded terrace and a small circular temple or pavilion at the  centre. In the foreground Pierrot supports his butterfly girl while 10 other young girls in crinoline dresses with wings pose in different but balanced groupings. Signed \u2018Allinson\u2019 in the bottom left hand corner.\n\nPapillons was choreographed by Mikhail Fokine to Robert Schumann\u2018s score orchestrated by Nicolas Tcherepnin. A programme notes that Shumann said that the end of his score represented the striking clock that ended carnival revelry and this provided the inspiration for the ballet.\n\u2018It is Carnival night, and Pierrot is wandereing alone, when suddenly he is entranced by the sight of rare butterflies. They are gay young girls from a Carnival ball, but the simple, amourous fellow is quite taken in, and seeks to allure them with a candle-flame, and captures the prettiest. But he hold her too roughly, and Pierrot has the distress of seeing his captive fall expiring. Can her fellow butterflies mend matters? They can. The wings are re-adjusted, she comes to life, and thee is merry-making and flirtation. But the Carnival ball ends, and Pierrot, seeking his rscaped butterfly, with mortification sees her transformed into a proper young lady going home discreetly chaperoned.\u2019\nThe scenery was by Mstislav Dobujinsky and costumes by L\u00e9on Bakst.\nPapillons was first produced at the Maryinsky Theatre, St Petersburg in 1912 and first danced by Serge Diaghilev\u2019s Ballet Russes at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Monte Carlo on 16 April 1914. It was revised by Aldolph Bolm for the second tour of America by the Ballets Russes and first seen at the London Coliseum on 19 September 1918. At this time Pierrot was danced by L\u00e9onide Massine and Lydia Lopokova the Butterfly/Girl he captures.\n\nAllinson\u2019s drawing suggests the format an illustration for a booklet in Cyril Beaumont\u2019s series Impressions of the Russian Ballet but this was never produced.",
