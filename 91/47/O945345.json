P. Rosenberg suggests however that the drawing was made by a close follower of Nicolas Poussin in the style of Fran\u00e7ois Verdier (1651-1730). \n\nThese drawings were probably executed as patterns for sculptured panels. They seem to draw their motif from antique statues which have not been identified. D. 319-1885 shows a woman lying in despair. She embraces a young boy with her right hand which also holds a jug. The drawing probably illustrates a scene of desperation due to a severe drought in the antique world.  \n\nA number of decorative projects and architectural designs have been influenced by Poussin, who favoured academic individual figures. In his early career, many artists worked as studio assistants with Poussin, drawing academic cartoons to help him to achieve designs for commissions and therefore imitating the master\u2019s manner. His work influenced a major part of the 17th century artists. P. Rosenberg suggests that the series was made by an artist in the circle of Fran\u00e7ois Verdier (1594-1649).",
