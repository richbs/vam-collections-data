His photographs of bridges, factories, and warehouses demonstrated that functional design was not an invention of the twentieth century, but had a long and honourable tradition in British architecture.  This picture of a watermill on the River Colne in Halstead, Essex, is a strong case in point.  Built in 1788 as a corn mill, it was bought in 1825 by Samuel Courtauld and converted to silk production.  The factory prospered, particularly after Courtaulds patented artificial silk, but was eventually forced by foreign competition to close in 1983.  It has been preserved as an historic landmark.",
