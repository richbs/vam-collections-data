The total receipts came to over \u00a3700 as the performance took place at the height of Master Betty's fame.\n\nMaster Betty was an English Child prodigy (known as the Young Roscius) who took London by storm during the 1804-5 season. Whilst appearing at Drury Lane he performed all the great tragic roles of Shakespeare and on one occassion the House of Commons is said to have adjourned to see him as Hamlet. He soon fell from favour however and after his one season of success faded in to obscurity. His fortune was squandered by his parents and despite living to the age of 80 he never achieved success on the stage again.",
