Queen Victoria and Prince Albert popularised the idea for children as well as for adults in Britain. One of the best-known of these occasions is the Lord Mayor of London\u2019s annual fancy-dress party, for children of employees of the Corporation of the City of London, which dates back in an unbroken tradition from 1883 to the present day. Flowers have always been one of the more popular subjects for fancy dress, as here. A best-selling book of the Victorian era, Fancy Dresses Described; or What to Wear at Fancy Balls by Ardern Holt, describes many of them in detail.\n\nThe dress is of mauve net over a mauve satinised cotton bodice and matching tarlatan petticoat. The neck, shoulders, cuffs and hem are trimmed with artificial violets, and the neck, shoulders and waist with large leaves made of moss green sateen.",
