In recognition of the inequality of this, the Governor of New Zealand of the time, Sir George Bowen, announced a new medal of equivalent rank to the VC. He was widely criticised in England, and accused of usurping the prerogative of Queen Victoria, but she eventually ratified his action and the New Zealand Cross, introduced on March 10, 1869, continued to be awarded through to 1881.\n\nOnly 23 New Zealand Crosses were awarded, making it one of the rarest medals recognising bravery in the world, and it has rarely been sold. The cross was awarded retrospectively for some actions that had taken place before it was instituted.",
