As a result, many Chinese illustrated books reached Japan, often in the form of encyclopaedia. One of the most important was the profusely illustrated Sancai tuhui (Tripartite picture assembly), published around 1610. Such works presented an exotic mixture of fact and fiction that was highly appealing. Of particular interest were the illustrations of mythical people and fabulous beasts, such as the shishi. \n\nThe appearance of Chinese illustrated books in Japan also coincided with the development of a thriving ivory-carving industry centred on the coastal regions of southern China, particularly Zhangzhou in Fujian province. This catered in large part for Portuguese and Spanish missionaries based throughout Asia. Through Japanese contact with China at this time, Chinese carvings reached Japan and played a crucial role in the development of netsuke. Ivory was subsequently one of the most important and widely used materials for the manufacture of netsuke, as in this example.",
