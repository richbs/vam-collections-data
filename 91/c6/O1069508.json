After good service as a dragoon captain, he went to London in 1762, with the Duc de Nivernais (Louis Jules Mancini). On returning to Versailles with the Treaty of Paris ratified (1763), he received the cross of St. Louis. Sent back to London with secret instructions from the King for espionage, he became involved in a quarrel with the French ambassador but refused to return to France\u2014afterward claiming that Louis XV had instructed him to redisguise himself as a woman and to hide in the city.\n\nSpeculation began in London as to the Chevalier\u2019s sex. Eventually, in need of money, he pretended to Beaumarchais in 1775 that he was really a woman. Believing this, Beaumarchais managed to get him a pension, but \u00c9on was ordered to return to France wearing women\u2019s dress. In 1777 he received the command; \u201cBy order of the king: Charles-Genevi\u00e8ve-Louise-Auguste-Andr\u00e9e-Timoth\u00e9e d\u2019\u00c9on de Beaumont is commanded to leave off the dragoon\u2019s uniform which she is wearing, and to dress according to her sex.\u201d Thenceforth he always wore women\u2019s dress. Having returned to London in 1785, he died there 25 years later. An autopsy performed two days after his death certified him male.\n\n(from the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica).",
