The surface is next prepared, moistened and inked; the greasy printing ink adheres to the design, which is then printed onto a sheet of paper.  To make a colour lithograph, a separate printing surface is required for each colour.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nHumour was one of the keys to success in the early  marketing campaigns for the beef extract Bovril.\n\nTrading\nThe name Bovril is derived from two words: bos, Latin for 'bull' or 'ox', and vril, a fictional word for an energising juice in Edward Bulwer-Lytton's novel The Coming Race (1871). Sales of Bovril were first recorded in Britain in 1886, at the Colonial and Continental Exhibition at South Kensington. But when Samuel Herbert Benson  - a former employee of Bovril Ltd - took over as the firm's advertising agent in the 1890s, business started to boom. His poster strategy, with designers working in close collaboration with copywriters, made Bovril a household name. The name was so recognisable that political cartoonists sometimes adapted the poster imagery in their work; a 1929 election campaign poster for the Conservative Party featured Liberal leader David Lloyd George and Labour leader James Ramsay MacDonald with horns along with the caption 'I hear they want more - Baldwin'.",
