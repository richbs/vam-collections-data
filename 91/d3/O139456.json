Jones was photographing at a time when parts of old Bristol were being lost to Victorian developments. Some of the small paned casement windows have already been replaced by larger panes of glass or sash windows. The adjoining building is a coffee and tea exchange.",

At a time when parts of old Bristol were being lost to Victorian development, Jones was aware of the ephemeral nature of the older buildings. In this photograph the small-paned casement windows have already been replaced with larger panes of glass or by sash windows. This image is more than a record, it is a thoughtfully composed grid of light and dark with the timber framed building achieving prominence.",
