Like coffee, these fermented black teas were usually drunk with milk or cream and often sweetened with sugar. In comfortably-off household, afternoon and after-dinner tea and coffee were generally served by the lady of the house.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe Lowestoft factory, where this jug was made, manufactured a type of porcelain strengthened with ashes from animal bones. The result was a comparatively durable ceramic material, one that would have been suitable for tea-drinking utensils and other utilitarian wares.\n\nTrading\nLowestoft porcelain was sold from a wholesale warehouse in Lowestoft itself and by a London agent. Tea and other wares with personal inscriptions could also be ordered from the factory.  According to a visitor to the factory in the 1780s, about half its output was exported to The Netherlands, and from there to France, where it was sold as 'Porcelain des Indes'.\n\nDesign\nThe dragon pattern was popular at several English porcelain factories, including Bow, Worcester, Lowestoft, Vauxhall and Liverpool, between the 1750s and the 1770s. The English factories probably originally copied the pattern from the painting of an early-18th-century Chinese dish.",
