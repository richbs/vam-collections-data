            "public_access_description": "Dom Sylvester Houedard was a Benedictine monk and eminent theologian, but also a pioneer, in Britain, of concrete poetry, a poetic form in which the arrangement of words and letters in a pattern on the page relates to the meaning or emotional impact of the poem. Using concrete poetry as a kind of springboard Houedard developed a way of making more purely abstract or pictorial images with the typewriter keys. \n\nThis particular image may have been designed using the typewriter but has been transferred to a more conventional print medium and thus has a different kind of visual impact from the works Houedard made directly as sheets of typed-on paper. The title of this piece refers to the Greek Mathematician Euclid (c.325-265 BC) whose treatise on geometry has influenced the development of Western mathematics for over 2,000 years. One of his axioms or general notions of mathematics was that 'things equal to the same thing are also equal to one another'.  The phrase 'franco-brittanique' also suggests 'Breton' or Gaelic which has a relationship with the Welsh language. Tim Drever (born 1935), to whose work  Houedard dedicated this piece, is a British artist who was exhibiting in London in the 1960s.",
