Beaumont had already produced a series of booklets on individual Diaghilev Ballets under the series title Impressions of the Russian Ballet and a number of wooden cut-out Diaghilev dancers in their famous roles.  He now decided to produce a series of hand coloured prints of typical scenes from the Diaghilev Ballet repertory.   He kept no records of when he began publishing the prints nor how many were produced, although he reckoned about twenty, mostly the work of Adrian Allinson, Ethelbert White and Randolf Schwabe who had also worked on Impressions of the Russian Ballet booklets and the wooden figures, and Eileen Mayo.  \nIn all these works, Beaumont strove to capture the exact moments of the ballet as well as artists' interpretations.  Possibly the design of each print followed the painstaking search for accuracy that had characterised the creation of the illustrations for Impressions of the Russian Ballet series, described in Bookseller at the Ballet - choosing the significant moment, watching the ballet night after night to check details of the poses and grouping (not easy when the stage was full of individual dancers and movement), going backstage to sketch scenery and borrow costumes - although some prints appear to be 'composite' rather than specific tableaux.  \nMost of the hand-colouring for Impressions of the Russian Ballet booklets was the work of Beaumont and his wife, Alice, and it is possible that both were also involved in colouring the prints, although eventually other artists were employed on both projects.\n\nHistorical significance: The Polovtsian Dances from Prince Igor was choreographed by Mikhail Fokine within the Borodin opera, but, performed as a separate work, was one of the most enduring and popular works in the Diaghilev Ballets Russes repertory.  More than any other work, it showed Fokine's break from the Petipa tradition of ballet which, whatever the period or style of a work, demanded pointe shoes and tutu.   The seeming barbaric ferocity of the choreography and the virile attack of the male dancers created a sensation on the opening night in Paris in 1909, and its success helped restore the reputation of the male dancer in Europe after half a century of neglect.",
