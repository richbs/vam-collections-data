These features are typical of pottery made in Iznik in the early 16th century. The broad white band may once have been gilded.\n\nThe small town of Iznik in north-west Anatolia has given its name to some of the most accomplished ceramics produced in the Islamic Middle East. In the mid 15th century, potters there specialised in modest earthenware imitations of Chinese blue-and-white porcelain. But in the 1460s or 1470s, under the patronage of Sultan Mehmet the Conqueror, they began to manufacture bowls, dishes and other pieces of fritware that were elegant in shape and decoration. These wares were often very large.\n\nAt first, the decoration of this new ware was also blue and white. The designs, however, were based on the highly stylised plant forms, knots and other patterns favoured by the Ottoman court. By the 1520s the connection with the court had weakened, and the potters were working mainly for the market. They expanded the range of colours and introduced new patterns from a wide range of sources.",
