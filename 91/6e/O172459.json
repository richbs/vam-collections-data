He is best known by these later works, but even his earliest productions suggest his future interests.\n\nDuring the 1920s and very early 1930s he was teaching at the Bauhaus and working with glass, furniture and typography, but in 1933 when the Bauhaus closed, he emigrated to the USA. He began making woodcuts and lino-cuts again. These prints are characterised by a mix of straight and parallel lines, large planes of black and white, areas shaded with black lines, and a sense of movement created through the use of angles and sloping or curved planes.",
