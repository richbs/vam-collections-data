He raises his right hand, the first two fingers in a gesture of blessing. With his left hand he holds a cross-staff which is being presented to him by a mitred bishop, who wears a girded alb and cope and blesses with his right hand. A similar figure on the left of the panel places the mitre on the saint's head with his left hand, blessing with his right. A cleric with a tonsured head stands behind the throne on the left at the back of the panel, carrying a crozier in his left hand and a book in his right. A similar figure stands on the right of the throne, the crozier in his left hand. \n\nThe top of the crozier on the right-hand side of the panel is missing. The top right-hand corner of the panel has been restored with plaster. Green paint and the usual daisy pattern remain on the ground. Traces of gilt are on the edges of the garments, as well as on the hair of the figures and on the top of the crozier. Gilding remains on the background at the top of the panel with traces of gesso knobs. The restored top right-hand corner has been repainted in gilt. The back of the panel is marked with a cross with incidental additions. There are three lead-plugged holes.",

St. Bernard's Abbey, Coalville, and one which in 1967 was in the collection of M. Dumez-Onof, Mount Street, London. In these examples, the archbishop's cross-staff is replaced by a crozier. \n\nA Consecration panel and a panel showing St. Thomas Becket arriving at Sandwich were sold at Christie's in 1980; both are evidently by the same hand and from the same altarpiece, confirming that the consecration scene is of St. Thomas.",
