The elections took place between the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and the reunification of East and West Germany.\n\nThe poster text states 'Frauen. Sozialer Abstieg. Nicht mit Uns!', which translates 'Women. Social decline. Not with us!. In this election the DFD campaigned mainly for the equality of women.\n\nThe League was founded back in 1947 as the official 'mass-organisation' for women to represent women's interests after World War Two and to spread the ideas of the ruling communist SED party among women. Later the DFD was part of the 'National Front', and as such supported SED politics, although it increasingly offered practical and further education such as health training and baby care. \n\nOn the 26th of October 1990 the DFD changed into the association changed into a registered society \u2013 the 'Demokratischer Frauenbund (Democratic Women's Association). The DFD  election campaign stirred up fear that women's rights in the new republic might diminish. Many problems prevalent at the time \u2013 such as the fight for equal rights for women - became second to the all-dominant theme of the reunification.",
