The group was a part of the lively art scene in late 19th-century Brussels, where intellectuals and artists formed avant-garde groups such as 'Les-Vingt', of which van Rysselberghe was a founder member. He was mainly a painter, but also produced prints and designed posters. He was influenced by Impressionism, and Pointillism in particular, in the 1880s, and became a leading painter in the genre in Belgium. He gradually moved away from the style, and was later influenced by Art Nouveau, as seen in this image. This poster was included in the V&A's Art Nouveau exhibition in 2000.",
