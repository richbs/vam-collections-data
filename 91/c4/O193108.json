Right-angles and parallel lines give way to converging or diverging lines and variable angles, and so spatial illusion also becomes more complex. \n\nHe continued this exploration throughout 1950s and early 1960s, when he also made prints  from mechanically engraved plastic or metal and sometimes as blind relief intaglios. By using a mechanical means of engraving his intention was to make the line as impersonal and therefore, as purely functional, as possible, By printing others blind, the line itself is partialy dematerialised, its own visibility rendered ambivalent.",
