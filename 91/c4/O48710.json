What appears to be a pretty embroidery is, in fact, a superbly designed example of functional art.\nthe fine silk has been embroidered with a double-faced or reversible pattern of individual plants and a narrow scrolling border.  There are seven motifs along each side, with a small branch of fruit alternating with a flower.  Two of the larger corner motifs are identical and the four borders form two identical pairs: down the left and along the bottom are single blossoms alternating with fruit, while along the top and down the right are floral sprigs bearing several flowers.\nThe kerchief would have been folded along a diagonal line to form a trianglar scarf and could be folded to create three different effects:\n(i) with a crown imperial at the lower corner and one border of each type;\n(ii) with the pomegrante in the lower corner and identical borders of deep colours;\n(iii) with the red currrants and wild hyacinth in the lower corner and identical borders in which the predominant colours are light blue and yellow.\nSuch deliberate versatility is the hallmark of a high quality and expensive dress accessory in any age and culture.\n\nAt least eleven of the seventeen fruits and flowers depicted were introduced into Europe from or through the Ottoman Empire.  The plants have been copied from botanical drawings and were not drawn from life - flowers and fruit seldom appear together on the stem. The source of these designs would most probably have been a series of scientific studies published in Central Europe in the middle of the 18th cnetury.  However, the emrboidery technique is not European.  The stitch used is one of the most characteristic Turkish embroidery stitches: in English it is called double darning and in Turkish 'pesent'. Because the needle goes over the same row twice, both sides of the work are identical.\nAs the fine silk ground is completely transparent, the designer did not intend the kerchief to be folded exactly in half to form a triangle.  If it were, both the border on the top and that underneath would be visible - one directly on top of the other - the lines and the colours would intermingle and become blurred and it would be impossible to see or appreciate the design.  If, instead, the kerchief is folded slightly off centre, it is possible to see two borders in perfect detail, one above the other - doubling the effect of pattern and colour.  A transparent silk ground and the Turkish stitch 'pesent' were deliberately selected in order to create this visually stunning and versatile accessory."

Along all four sides there is a 2 cm deep border of scrolling stems bearing flowers, fruits and berries. Above this there is a 12 cm deep border of isolated floral or fruit sprigs arranged so that the kerchief can be folded diagonally to reveal different design and colour combinations. Square but designed to be folded and worn as a triangle.\n\nThe kerchief could be folded to create three different effects:\n1. With a Crown Imperial at the lower corner there is one border of each type on either side.\n2. With a pomegranate in the lower corner there are identical borders with deep colours.\n3. With the red currants and hyacinth in the lower border there are identical borders with paler colours.\n\nThe embroidery is reversible.",

At least eleven of the seventeen fruits and flowers depicted were introduced into Europe from or through the Ottoman Empire.  The plants have been copied from botanical drawings, and the source of these designs would probably have been a series of scientific studies published in Central Europe in the middle of the 18th century.  \nHowever, the embroidery technique is not European.  The stitch used is one of the most characteristic Turkish embroidery stitches, known in English as double darning and in as Turkish 'pesent'. Because the needle goes over the same row twice, both sides of the work are identical. As the fine silk ground is completely transparent, the kerchief needs to be folded slightly off centre. Then it is possible to see two borders in perfect detail, doubling the effect of pattern and colour.",

There are 17 different floral motifs and at least 75% were introduced into Western Europe from or through the Ottoman Empire.\n\nThese plants were not drawn from life but were copied from published botanical plates. By looking at the style of the drawings it is possible to suggest a date of place of origin: 'Plantae Selectae' by Georg Ehret published in Nuremburg in 1750 is very similar.  After London, Nuremburg was the most important centre of botanical art in the 18th century and many artists of greater or lesser distinction studied under Ehret, so his work must have been known throughout Central Europe.\n\nThe embroidery is reversible: at the beginning of the 17th century Pietro della Valle wrote that he saw Turks embroidering 'with silks in various colours ... showing the same pattern back and front'.  Towards the end of the 18th century Lady Elizabeth Craven found the same embroidery technique equally puzzling: she mentions a piece made of muslin with embroidered borders and says 'what I could not comprehend, both sides are the same.'  This effect is achieved by the most characteristic of all Turkish stitches: in English it is called double darning and in Turkish it is called pesent. Because the ground fabric is transparent and because the embroidery is reversible the designer did not intend the kerchief to be folded into an exact triangle - the lines and colours of the two borders would become indistinct.  If the kerchief is folded slightly off centre it is possible to see two borders in perfect detail, one slightly above the other.",
