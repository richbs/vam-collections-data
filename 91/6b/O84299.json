In the series Ann Jones (born Britain 1960) isolates and examines instruments used in female grooming.  The photographs are presented in deep frames with labels which parody museum information.  They are offered as if they were artefacts from a remote civilization or society, but are in fact from Britain in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nA C-type print, such as Ektachrome, is a colour print in which the print material has at least three emulsion layers of light sensitive silver salts. Each layer is sensitised to a different primary colour - either red, blue or green - and so records different information about the colour make-up of the image. During printing, chemicals are added which form dyes of the appropriate colour in the emulsion layers. It is the most common type of colour photograph.",
