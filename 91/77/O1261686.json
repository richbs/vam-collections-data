The upper sides of the titanium panel are shaded and the lower sides of the silver frame polished, to give a convincing illusion of depth to what is a flat sheet. On the reverse is a horizontal pin, the catch for which is missing.",

In 1975 he was awarded the Sandersons Art in Industry Award to travel in Japan, where he concentrated on the skills of metal inlay and patination. He went on to develop his own sophisticated and exacting method of anodizing titanium allowing him to achieve a remarkably complex and painterly effect. \n\nIn this piece, with its confetti-like scattering of brightly-coloured shapes, each shape required careful masking and individual treatment both for polishing the surface and applying the elecrical charge. Variations of colour are created by varying the voltage and timing of the electrical current through the metal, while the fine detail he achieves, notably in the clouds, is the reward of carefully controlling the current through the finest tip of a modified paintbrush.\n\nDe Large developed this style and technique through the second half of the 1970s. This brooch, made in 1981 after he had left London for San Diego, he has referred to as 'the ultimate expression of that series'.",
