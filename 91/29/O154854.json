The pages for The Merchant of Venice include sketches of draperies, headdresses, sleeve and shoulder details, Venetian carnival masks and dominos, together with colour notes.   \n\tOther pages possibly relate to Madam Butterfly, while another section records sets for a production of Othello, showing how the background scenes change within a permanent front-stage setting.",
