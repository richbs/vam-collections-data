            "history_note": "This caricature is in reference to the Mary Anne Clark affair. Mary Anne (1776-1852) was the married mistress of Frederick, Duke of York, the Commander in Chief of the Army. In 1809, she testified before the House of Commons that she had sold army commissions with the Duke's knowledge. As a result of the scandal Duke resigned his position, although was later reinstated, but not before he had severed his ties to Clarke, who was forced to leave London and eventually, following a prosecution for libel in 1813 and nine months imprisonment, emigrated to France.\n\nAn account of Dr. O'Meara's involvement is given below:\n\n\"Mrs. Clarke stated in her examination of 9 Feb. that Dr. O'Meara applied to her to be made a bishop, that she communicated the offer to the Duke of York, and that he answered that O'Meara had preached before the King who did not like the O in his name. On 13 Feb. she produced a letter from the Duke (dated 4 August) saying  'Dr. O'Meara called upon me yesterday, and delivered me your letter; he wishes much to preach before Royalty, and if I can put him in the way of it I will.' Parl. Debates, xii. 474, 583. The sermon was duly preached at Weymouth. Pol. Reg. xv. 380-3 (11 Mar.). Mrs. Clarke, having taken money for procuring a bishopric, seems to have passed on a mere request to preach before the King.\"\nFrom M.
