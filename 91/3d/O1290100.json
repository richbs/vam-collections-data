She is inspired by many different materials to produce her work which has earned her the title of 'the material girl'.\n\nWhen a film producer friend of Kessler's gave her a batch of 35 mm film she used it to embark on a new book art project. Kessler cut up the film into one inch strips. Following earlier experiments involving the painting of the underside of PVC sheets, she decided to paint over the hidden images on the film in vivid colours. These were then scratched with abstract text and the resulting small 'pages' spiral bound together with a piece of elastic band to produce a series of miniature books.\n\nThe NAL copy is no. 23 - most of the other copies in the limited edition were bought by Kessler's film producer friend.",
