They formed a frieze that was particularly suitable for embroidery with figure subjects, often featuring a narrative to provide interest and entertainment. Sets of bed hangings also created a draught-free and private sleeping compartment. \n\nThe style and workmanship of this valance suggests that it was made in a professional workshop either in France itself or under strong French influence. It depicts a scene of courtly life in an ornamental garden landscape, with figures in rich contemporary fashions.",
