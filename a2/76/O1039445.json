They are in fact clay models, photographed and attached to presentation drawings which Holscher and Tye submitted to an international competition for sanitary ware design, organised by the International Union of Architects. The competition laid down three requirements: that the design should be aesthetically pleasing when installed, that it should be functional from the user's point of view (rather than for the convenience of the plumber), and that it should be easy to produce and install. Underneath the photographs are drawings of alternative arrangements for the sanitary ware, to fit differently shaped bathrooms. Holscher and Tye's designs won first prize and were later produced as the 'Meridian One' range by Adamsez Ltd., launched in 1964. The following year the range won a Council of Industrial Design Award, and the finished products were later featured in 1966 in <i>Bathrooms</i>, a Design Council publication, promoted as examples of good design. \n   This form of bowl, which fitted flush with the wall and therefore concealed all the plumbing, was a popular look in the 1960s and 1970s. It presented a neat finish to the appearance of the bathroom, contrasting to earlier designs in which pipes were prominent. The 'Meridian One' range had the advantage of being made of lightweight vitreous china, and was designed to be fitted to a tiled wall without the need for cutting the tiles. As such, it was the perfect combination of style, practicality and convenience.\"",
