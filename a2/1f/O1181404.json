He felt they could not express his emotions and perceptions of the town sufficiently. During his search for a suitable medium he discovered the pin-hole camera. A simple tool, this type of camera is merely a wooden box with a hole. Most of the technical operations are left to chance - from estimating the correct distance for focusing to the exposure time. Pinhole cameras are still used today in Afghanistan by the ak\u00e2sse fawri- zarouri, literally translated as the 'instant-urgent photographer', to capture portraits in the streets in front of a cloth backdrop. Atiq Rahimi used the pinhole camera to take pictures of people in everyday life situations and places around Kabul. As a result of the nature of experimentation and chance, these photographic prints are unique pieces that cannot be replicated. Grainy and dream-like, the process makes them appear to have been made in the late 19th or early 20th century; yet on closer inspection modern details, such as architecture of clothing, gives clues as to their modernity.",
