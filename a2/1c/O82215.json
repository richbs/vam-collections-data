He was in India from 1850 t0 1856, during which time he travelled extensively from Bombay (Mumbai) and across western India to Rajasthan, Delhi, Kashmir, Lahore and Afghanistan. His depiction of every day street scenes and groups of people is remarkably accurate and animated, his portraits vividly capturing the character of his sitters and the glowing effects of sunlight as cityscapes and architectural monuments. Brilliantly executed in a range of warm colours, his watercolours evoke a gentle romanticism.\n\nAfter his return to England, The Illustrated London News published some of his watercolours. In 1881, he exhibited 275 of his paintings in a one-man show in the South Kensington Museum, London. This entire collection was subsequently acquired by the V&A.\n\nNautch girls were a popular subject for artists and this idealised painting typifies the kind of romantic sentiment that was inspired by the landscapes and people of Kashmir. Carpenter's romantic vision of Kashmir, and India in general, was heavily influenced by the popular poem Lalla Rookh by Thomas Moore. Based on travellers' tales and pictorial sources the poem focuses on Emperor Aurangzeb's daughter, Lalla Rookh, and provides a generalized view of the Orient using exotic imagery with a mixture of Indian, Iranian and Turkish elements.",

His depiction of every day street scenes and groups of people is remarkably accurate and animated, his portraits vividly capturing the character of his sitters and the glowing effects of sunlight as cityscapes and architectural monuments. Brilliantly executed in a range of warm colours, his watercolours evoke a gentle romanticism.\n\nAfter his return to England, The Illustrated London News published some of his watercolours. In 1881, he exhibited 275 of his paintings in a one-man show in the South Kensington Museum, London. This entire collection was subsequently acquired by the V&A.",
