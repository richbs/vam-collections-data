On the day of the charak itself, people construct bamboo stages on top of poles, at a height ranging from three to five metres.

Fanny Parks recounts: '... a post some thirty feet in height was crossed at the top by a horizontal bamboo, from one end of which a man was swinging, suspended by a rope ... The man swung in a circle of perhaps thirty feet diameter, supported by four iron hooks, two through the flesh of his back, and two in that of his chest ... he carried a bag in one hand, from which he threw sweetmeats and flowers to the populace below.'
