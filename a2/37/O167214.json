Symmetrical knot tied around 3 threads with one uncovered thread between each knot.  266 knots per sq. inch (4070 per sq. dm).\n\nSIDE FINISH: returned weft.  The outer two warp threads are dark blue wool.\n\nEND FINISH: Lower: warp threads have been grouped to form 7 plaits, 42 cms. long.  Upper: incomplete: warp threads twisted in groups to form fringe of 33.5 cms.)\n\nDESIGN: Field: cream plain weave ground with sequences of varying lengths with piled motifs, sometimes flowering plants and sometimes geometrical, and sometimes a combination, all symmetrical along a central axis.  These sequences are separated by rectangular panels of geometric motifs.  Some of these areas contain two bands of red triangles formed by weft-floats on the warp-faced ground.  The extreme end panels are decorated with bands of predominantly geometric motifs in the weft-floating technique.  The lower part of the upmost panel has one band of naturalistic floral sprigs.\n\nMain border: a zigzag in all colours except yellow.  It stops before the end panels.\nInner and outer borders: a simple red warp stripe.\n\nDate catalogued: 24.4.96",
