            "history_note": "The printing presses were established in Bengal by 1780's, but engraving of illustrations on metal remained at a crude level and expensive. Whereas, for illustrated books or prints intended for the Indian market, cheapness was essential. In view of this woodcuts became popular method of reproduction, since the materials were cheap and easily available. Like Kalighat paintings the subject matter of the woodcut prints was mainly religious. Numerous pamphlets and small books could also be bought at a low cost illustrated with woodcuts. Little is known about these woodcuts and the craftsmen who made them. The woodcuts were certainly being made in large quantities by 1860's. The majority of the engravers were living in North Calcutta, areas such as Ahiritola, Shobhabazar, Kombuleetola, Simulia and Bottala. Various shops in the area acted as agents for the craftsmen and sold their work for them. The artist of this particular woodcut, Krishna Chandra lived in Shobhabazar. The Calcutta woodcuts eventually suffered from the competition of cheap lithographic prints. During the eighteen-sixties, chromo-lithography had reached India and their shiny garish products at once appealed to the popular market.",
