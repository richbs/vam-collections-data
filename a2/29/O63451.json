The tulle on the neckline has disintegrated.  The bodice is fastened on the left with a hook and eye closure.  The long, full sleeves end in trumpet-shaped net cuffs, heavily embroidered with the same pattern and materials as the bodice.  From the hips downwards the decoration flows into larger flower and leaf motifs, voided and infilled with net.  The train is very long and made of silk satin with pearl, bead and metal thread embroidery.  The sides are edged with a wide border of tulle to create a dreamlike effect.  The front part of the dress is cut away and the train forms the back.",

The original owner, Mrs Dorothy Miller, bought it in 1931 during a visit to New York and wore it for her wedding the following year.  The history of the dress and the photograph of Mrs Miller wearing it on her wedding day (see RPs), provides intersting information which set the object in the context of its time.  The photograph would be particularly valuable for exhibition purposes.\n\nHistorical significance: This is a beautiful example of an early Hartnell wedding ensemble which would form a central focus for an exhibition on marriage.\n\nThe importance of the gown lies in the fact that is it such and early and ornate example of a Hartnell wedding gown (the other wedding dress by Hartnell of a similar date, although in a better condition, is of inferior quality and design).
