Snuff taking became popular in England with the Great Plague (1664-1665) as people thought it had valuable antiseptic properties. It was mainly a male habit, although Catherine de Medici started the fashion for snuff at the French court.\n\nSilver featured in all aspects of a gentleman\u2019s daily life, from the morning toilet to an evening at his club. Personal silver was commonly engraved with armorials or a crest, a name or initials. The less affluent would hope to own to a few small pieces of silver, perhaps a pair of shoe buckles, a snuff box and a watch.",
