A strip of white cotton has been sewn around all four sides.\nDirectional design with the top of the pattern at the bottom of the panel, so that the wearer saw the correct pattern. There is a border along the bottom and part way up the sides. Part of the border has been cut along the lower edge. It is a wide border with faint yellow lines forming outward pointing arches each containing a spray of small buds, pink ones around a blue one or pale ones around a pink one.\n\nThe main pattern is a series of diagonal lines from lower right to upper left.  These are chevron lines in pink [faded] and dark green.\n\nThere are four sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: blue ground with a group of 3 white flowers alternating with a pink carnation pointing to the lower right.\n[2] wider stripes: white ground with straight pink stem pointing to the right with one large and two small pale flowers alternating with straight pink stem pointing down with two small flowers and one large pink flower - the latter bends to the lower right.\n[3] wider stripes: pink ground with indistinct pattern: small downward pointing vase outlined in light blue with blue and white flowers alternating with straight green stem, pair of leaves edged with green, central circle of small white flowers and 3 light blue and white flowers.\n[4] widest stripes: light green ground with yellow vase outlined in light blue and spray of clusters of white flowers alternating with curved pink stem and very large pink blossom with elongated leaves.\n\nThreads: silk; 2S; dark blue, black, white, light blue, pink, light pink, green, yellow, very light blue, dark green, very light green.",
