She had a more wholesome look, which made her the best selling doll in the United Kingdom in 1968 and 1970. Hasbro then bought the rights to Sindy and remodelled her to look more American in order to appeal to that particular audience. \n\nIn the early 1990s there was a legal battle between Sindy and Barbie. Mattel, the owners of Barbie, felt that Sindy's new look was too similar to Barbie. Barbie won her case in court and Sindy was forced to change her look again. Currently, Sindy is aimed at a pre-school aged audience because other dolls such as Barbie and Bratz now dominate the original pre-adolescent target audience Sindy was originally intended for.",
