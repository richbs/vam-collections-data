            "public_access_description": "The name Pomander is derived from the French pomme ambre or pomme d\u2019embre, meaning \u201camber apple\u201d. This referred to a fruit infused with vinegar and other aromatic substances. Pomanders were personal items of jewellery usually hung at the waist or worn around the neck. The hinged compartments, which open like segments of an orange, contained different scents and were often engraved with the names of the substances inside. The interior of this pomander is engraved with floral decoration, perhaps to evoke its contents.\n\nThis piece is an example of 16th century domestic silver. Such silver was both functional and ornamental. Objects for dining and drinking took elegant forms and were decorated in the latest styles. Beautifully crafted items intended only for display often adopted functional forms such as cups and dishes. Domestic silver was not confined to the most wealthy. Many people owned silver spoons or mounted vessels, items which often became treasured possessions.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.
