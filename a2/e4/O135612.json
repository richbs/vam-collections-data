They were elaborate occasions designed to show of the wealth and splendour of the host and to honour the guests. Carving meat at the banquet was an important part of the ritual. Sets like this one were often made from precious materials, as carving was a very public part of the feast. The appointed carver would use two knives, one to hold the meat and the other to keep it steady. This set also includes a skewer, a fork and a broad bladed knife for serving.",

According to Vincenzo Cervio's treatise on carving, <i>Il Trinciante</i>, in 1581 meat was carved in Germany on a plate or trencher using long handled forks with short tines and knives with rounded ends and long handles. This set seems to be indicative of the German tradition.",

They were elaborate occasions designed to show of the wealth and splendour of the host and to honour the guests. Carving meat at the banquet was an important part of the ritual. Sets like this one were often made from precious materials, as carving was a very public part of the feast. The appointed carver would use two knives, one to hold the meat and the other to keep it steady. This set also includes a skewer, a fork and a broad bladed knife for serving. Appointed carvers were often very important nobles at the feast. At the coronation of Anne Boleyn for example, the Earl of Sussex was appointed carver.",
