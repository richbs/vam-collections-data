The right hand holds a blue lotus bud (nilotpala) in kataka mudra; the left arm is extended in lola hasta.   The figure wears a coronet (karanda makuta), and the siras cakra ( disc behind the head) is small and flower-like, now partly broken.  The lower garment is worn with girdle and sash, the former comparatively plain and the latter with projecting bows at the hips.  Other details include a channavira-type harness, keyura armlets, elbow bracelets with conspicuous projecting ornaments, extended ear lobes without pendants, and padasaras on the feet.  A marriage symbol (tali) is worn above the three necklaces.  The image is crudely riveted to its lotus pedestal, and saw-marks around the rim of the pedestal confirm that the present method of junction is not the original one.  The base has projecting rings for processional carrying.  Traces of encrusted carbonate matter in surface crevices indicate a period of earth burial.",
