The printer created the areas of  raised pile by printing part of the design with glue and then scattering powdered wool over the paper. This powdered wool, or flock, stuck to the gluey areas and made a raised velvety pile. In the 18th century flock wallpaper was a luxury product that only wealthy English customers could afford.",
