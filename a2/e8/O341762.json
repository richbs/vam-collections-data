Cellier's display was described by a critic as imitating damascened bronze and by another as oriental, refined and with an indefinable aesthetic which, nevertheless, had an evident charm. The confusion is understandable. The decoration refers both to Japanese lacquer and to Indian pattering, while the cup's form is distantly related to acient Greek or Etruscan originals."
