His father was the second son of the marionette company proprietors Ambrose Tiller and Eliza Cheadle, and in 1901 Ambrose II started his own company, Tiller's Mechanical Mannikin Show and Theatre of Varieties.\n\nAmbrose II married Sarah Chipperfield, of the circus proprietors' family, and had nine children.  By 1909 he had added a bioscope to the show. They toured much of East Anglia and Lincolnshire, performing at fairs and setting up their booth in inn yards. By 1914 the emphasis had changed and his travelling show was known as 'Cinema and Mannikins'.  The show continued until the early 1930s, but  during this time Ambrose and his sons built a cinema at Long Sutton, which they managed until the 1950s.",

He married Sarah Chipperfield and had nine children.  By 1909 he had added a bioscope to the show. They toured much of East Anglia and Lincolnshire, performing at fairs and setting up their booth in inn yards. By 1914 the emphasis had changed and his travelling show was 'Cinema and Mannikins'.  The show continued until the early 1930s, but  during this time Ambrose and his sons had built a cinema at Long Sutton, which they managed until the 1950s. In the 1950s James Tiller (son of Ambrose II) revived the marionettes for a time, but eventually sold his part of the marionette troupe to the Museum of Entertainment at Whaplode St. Catherine, Lincolnshire.\" (Extract from: John McCormick with Clodagh McCormick and John Phillips: The Victorian Marionette Theatre.
