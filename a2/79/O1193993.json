The programme included La Marseillaise, God Save the King, Act 1 of I Pescatori di Perle and Act 11 of Faust.\n\nSilk or satin programmes were frequently produced to commemorate special evenings at the theatre during the 18th and 19th centuries. For this event in honour of the French President, the theatre was decorated with roses on a green trellis around the tiers, crimson and gold fabric festooned with orchids was hung around the six centre boxes on the grand tier that were made into the Royal Box, yellow and pink roses decorated the proscenium arch, with an Imperial crown above it.. Reviewers noted that it was an evening celebrating French opera which had previously been sadly neglected at Covent Garden in favour of German and Italian opera, but that Gounoud and Bizet were the composers 'par excellence' for a command performance. Both French operas were nevertheless sung in Italian, perhaps somewhat of a disappointment to the President.",
