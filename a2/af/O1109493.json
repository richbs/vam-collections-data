DENNY BANNERET 1524\n</i>\n<b>Provenance:</b> The Denny family; given to the Museum by the then Sir Edward Denny, 1889\n. \n<b>Literature:</b> <i>Catalogue of Miniatures</i>, 1908, p. 37 (Anon., British, 17th century); Long 1930, p. 89; <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 68 (as Anon., French, 17th century). \n\nThe entry in the <i>Summary Catalogue</i> of 1981, ascribing the miniature to the French school, was a mistake: there is nothing either technical or iconographic to suggest a French origin. \n\nThe framing of the miniature and the inscription seem to reflect a period of genealogical enthusiasm in the Denny family during the later nineteenth century, but these were not taken seriously by the donor, Sir Edward Denny, who suggested that the sitter might rather be the Sir Edward Denny (1605-1646) of Tralee Castle, High Sheriff of Kerry (1634), MP (1639), and a commander for Charles I in Ireland under the Duke of Ormonde. This is possible, but the greater likelihood, on the grounds of the sitter's dress, is that he was neither a military knight nor a landed baronet, but a cleric, scholar or similar professional, perhaps a tutor in the family. The painter correspondingly is not of the highest standard. The relevant contrast would be with works like Cooper, Cat. No. 65 or Hoskins, Cat. No. 33, both of 1647, both soldier portraits, and both representative in quality and technique of the best English practice during the civil wars. The painter here may well be an amateur.\" ",
