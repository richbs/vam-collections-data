            "physical_description": "Walnut cassone in the form of sarcophagi, boarded construction on poplar? carcase\n\nDove-tailed plank construction with mitred corners, the bottom looks like two planks nailed up. \nThe carved ends are basically a single shaped carved plank of cushion form between the base to the gadrooned moulding. The right hand end  is the cushion moulding not a single piece but consists of one large element with a section (5.5cm) glued at the back. Above it is a single cavetto moulding (main piece of carving 35cm high, cavetto 8cm high). Below the main cushion moulding is a narrow torus moulding nailed to conceal the edges of the bottom boards. The main cushion moulding is attached to a wedge-shaped spacing plank. \nThe back consists of three planks, scrub-planed on the  middle plank, pit-sawn on the lower plank. Each end consists of two glued planks; the front appears to be three planks: a narrow strip at the top, a deep central plank and a narrow plank at the bottom. The lid is held on three ring hinges apparently original. The construction of the lid is a frame of end-lapped construction to which walnut moulded and mitred elements are applied all around, and a single top walnut plank with an ovolo moulding all around. It overhangs the back of the chest by 4.5cm.\nThe four feet are in the form of a lion paw each with a scroll ankle. Those at the front set at 45 degrees, those at the back at 90 degrees.\n\nMissing the torus moulding at the right hand end and at the left hand end the torus moulding has been replaced crudely. There is a small loss a the rear left of the lid.\nThe lock missing. A dark stain all over. \n\nAs with 6001-1859 there is a worrying lack of wear on feet, hinges, locks. The carved surfaces seem even, regular and lifeless, where 16c would not be.\nBoth need to be examined under good light.",
