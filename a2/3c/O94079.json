This massive figure group was purchased from the artist by the young Lord Malton, later 2nd Marquess of Rockingham, when he visited Italy in 1749 in order to obtain works of art for his father's new house, Wentworth Woodhouse, in Yorkshire. The sculpture remained there, displayed in the sculpture gallery in the house, until 1985.\n\nThe marble from which this sculpture is carved was probably originally intended for a work by Giambologna, a replacement for his earlier Samson and the Philistine (Museum no. Museum no. A.7-1954), which had been sent as a gift to Spain in 1601. In the event Giambologna did not carve the replacement, and the block was given to the Granducal sculptor, Giambattista Foggini, who took over Giambologna's workshop. It then became available to Giambattista's son and pupil, Vincenzo.",
