Though land-locked and at first dependent on 'crate men' selling pottery from their backpacks, the North Staffordshire potteries eventually improved their turnpike roads and began to use the River Trent to gain access to the sea and foreign markets.\n\nMaterials & Making\nStill using local clays, Staffordshire potters could produce only a limited range of decorative effects. The technique of  combing different coloured slips, which gave a feathered appearance, was one of the simplest and most effective. It became the standard decoration of baking dishes and remained popular until the late 19th century.",
