            "public_access_description": "The church of San Salvador was originally founded in the VIIth century however the current edifice was built between 1507 and 1534 by Giorgio Spavento and continued after his death the following year by Tullio Lombardo, Vincenzo Scamozzi and possibly Jacopo Sansovino.The drawing depicts the fa\u00e7ade with its flight of stairs leading up to the front door surmounted by a pediment decorated with two leaning figures and two small free-standing statues on top, supported by Corinthian columns. On each side, there is a narrow rectangular window surmounted by a pediment with two leaning putti on top. A cornice above a frieze with carved garlands delimited the two levels. The upper section of the fa\u00e7ade has a narrow bow window on the middle and a small square window on each side. A broken pediment with free-standing statues completed the fa\u00e7ade.\n\nAntonio Visentini (Venice, 21 Nov 1688 \u2013 Venice, 26 June 1782) was an Italian painter, engraver, architect and theorist. He was first known as a painter and trained with the Venetian history painter Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini (1675-1741). He became known as an engraver by the end of the 1720s when he was commissioned by Joseph Smith to produce engravings of Canaletto\u2019s views of Venice. Visentini started working as an architect in 1731, and his first theoretical work, Libro di Architettura, which included Rococo-influenced drawings by Pier Antonio Morelli after Visentini\u2019s ideas, was published in 1733. \n\nHis ideas on contemporary architecture derived from Antiquity and the work of Andrea Palladio (1508-80). Later however, Visentini developed neo-Palladian and anti-Baroque ideas. Visentini and his pupils executed numerous drawings of ancient and contemporary buildings intended to disseminate exemplary architecture. He participated to the foundation of the Venetian Academy in 1755, where he became a teacher of architectural perspective in 1772.",
