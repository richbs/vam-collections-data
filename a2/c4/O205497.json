The Album contains 254 drawings and includes works by Sir John Vanbrugh, Sir Edward Lovett Pearce, William Talman, Nicholas Hawksmoor, Richard Castle and anonymous draughtsmen in Vanbrugh's office.

Writing in 1722 to Lord Carlisle about his son Charles, Vanbrugh says `...[he] is much pleas'd with a House I am building him in the Field at Greenh: it being a Tower of White Bricks, only one room and a closet on a floor.' See Downes (1987).\n\nAccording to Colvin and Craig, the plan of the building is given in E.2124.45, .75 and .89, and described in E.2124.89 as the `New White Tower'. As the inscriptions indicate, there is a problem as the measurements do not tally. \n\nPart of the <i>Vanbrugh Album</i>, which was purchased in 1992 with the aid of the National Heritage Memorial Fund, the National Art Collections Fund, The Monument Trust, The Sainsbury Trust, and an anonymous donor.",
