This game was originally designed to accompany a teaching pack Conflict, Change and Our Future. It was intended for use in schools for children aged between 9 and 13.\n\nThis game was previously owned by Bob Dixon, along with similar types of games. Robert Turnbull Dixon was a poet, author and peace activist. He grew up in County Durham and was very interested in assessing what affects and influences young people as they grow up. These types of games are valuable as we do not have anything like this within our collections, and they were an important part of the research for the books he wrote.",
