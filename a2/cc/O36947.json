The platform is blue with white and red markings, two green, red, yellow and white wheels and a third small wheel underneath which is angled to the left so the toy goes in circles.  The drum is red with yellow, brown and black markings; on one side is an illustration of a white mouse in blue jacket and on the other side a black and white panda.  On the top is half a cymbal disc of brass coloured metal.  The figure is white with green striped trousers and a top with purple, blue, brown, yellow and red markings.  The sleeves of the figure are white cotton.  The head and hands are soft vinyl, with the head showing black hair and eyes and a red mouth.  Attached to the right hand is a coil of metal ending in a red plastic knob which represents the drum stick and to the left hand is the top half of the cymbal.\nThe clockwork mechanism is house in the body of the figure and when wound up, it operates the large wheels and moves the platform along.  At the same time, the right hand beats the drum and the left clashes the cymbal.\n4.  winding key",
