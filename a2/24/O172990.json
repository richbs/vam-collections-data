She is the patron saint of artillerymen, military engineers and miners and all professions who work with explosives. \n\nHer legend seems not to have any historical foundation behind it. It tells that her father built a tower with two windows where he shut his daughter in to keep her away from her suitors. Barbara persuaded the workmen to add a third window, which symbolises the Trinity.\n\nHer father later killed her. He then was killed by a lightning and that is why Saint Barbara became the patroness of all professions related to gunfire and firearms.",
