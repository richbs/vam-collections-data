A monstrance or ostensorium is a liturgical vessel used in the Roman Catholic Church. The names come from the Latin words \"monstrare\" and \"ostendere\" which mean \"to show\". Monstrances were used to display sacred items, namely the Eucharist,  to the congregation. When the host, or bread, is blessed during Mass, Roman Catholics believe that it becomes the body of Christ. From around 1200, priests held it up at this point for the congregation to venerate. Gradually monstrances began to be made, in order to display the host after Mass had been said.",

Churches, cathedrals and monasteries collected and displayed relics (the bones or possessions of the saints) for the veneration of the congregation. Pilgrimage became very popular in this period. People travelled long distances to view holy relics in magnificent reliquaries and shrines. Churches also developed the tradition of displaying the Body of Christ, in the form of the Eucharist (Holy bread blessed by the Priest) in rich monstrances during the Mass.\n\n\nThe development of Gothic architecture in the 12th century had a huge impact on the styles of the Middle Ages. This new architecture focused upon the use of light, which passed through long stained glass windows. This use of light had an important symbolic meaning; it represented the Light and God. It is possible that medieval liturgical metalwork was inspired by the new style of Gothic architecture and its symbolism. Monstrances, incense burners and reliquaries echoed gothic architectural forms in this period. This example allows the light to pour through the gothic windows of decorated tracery.",
