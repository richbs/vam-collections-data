Much of her work investigates everyday life and the often unspoken emotions and experiences of the people she chooses to photograph or to film. For this print, Wearing photographed a teenaged girl sitting alone on a beachfront bench; behind her is a painted fresco of an idyllic seaside scene. Wearing asked the girl to write to her about her views on men, and has reproduced below the image her mixed thoughts, expressed in multi-coloured hand-writing, about her boyfriend and their up-and-down relationship.\n\nThis print was published by Counter Editions in 2000 in a portfolio of 14 works by contemporary artists.",
