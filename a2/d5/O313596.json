Daolmi (1999, 193-216) dates the medal ca. 1570 by comparison to his earlier portrait aged forty-four on the frontispiece of <u>L'antica musica ridotta alla moderna prattica</u> in 1555. The inscription on the frontispiece declares that Vicentino is  \"the inventor of the practical division of the chromatic and enharmonic mode of the <i>arcicembalo</i>\" (ARCHICYMBALI DIVISIONIS CHROMATICIQ AC ENARMONICI GENERIS PRACTICAE INVENTOR), which thus clarifies the inscription on the reverse of this medal as referring to Vicentino's subdivision of the chromatic scale  (Attwood, 2003, no. 193). \nFor the successive attributions given to the medal see Attwood (2003, no. 193)",

He revived the study of ancient Greek music theory and practice to link it to contemporary music, and is best known for his invention of two musical instruments with double keyboard, neither of which survives. \n The <i>arcicembalo</i>, or \"super-harpsichord\" containing thirty-six keys to the octave, was constructed in 1555, the year of the publication of his <u>L'antica musica ridotta alla moderna prattica</u> [or Ancient Music adapted to Modern Practice], where he described his invention. He also devised the <i>arciorgano</i> or \"super-organ\", described in Vicentino's <u>Descrizione dell'arciorgano</u> in 1561.As Philip Attwood writes, 'the larger number of keys on [both instruments] provided a wider range of tonality than was generally available to sixteenth-century musical instruments' (Attwood, 2003, no. 193).",
