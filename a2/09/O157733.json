In the neoclassical period these ancient legends were depicted in a style that itself was inspired by rediscovered ancient art.\n\nIn this micromosaic picture two aspects of the neoclassical style which are directly drawn from the study of ancient art can be seen: the reduction of compositions to clear, crisp lines with a limited colour range that emulates the marble surfaces associated with ancient sculpture (known as en grisaille), and a schematic stillness even in a scene that depicts a moving chariot. Interestingly enough neither of these characteristics was shared by ancient art as such: ancient sculpture is nowadays known to often have been painted, while the approach to depicting movement depended very much on the period of ancient art itself, the medium and the ability of the artist.",

By 1800  such micromosaics became particularly fashionable as a technique that expressed neoclassical taste  even in the very choice of its medium. Their portability made them the perfect souvenir to take back  from Rome. \n\n<b>Inspiration from Antiquity and Renaissance Art</b>\n\nThis micromosaic, on of a pair, emulates the style of ancient Roman wall paintings from the first century AD, such as the decoration of the House of the Vettii in Pompeii where a cycle of putti racing against each other in chariots drawn by a variety of beasts has survived. The Queen of Naples herself owned the fragment of a Pompeian wall painting depicting a Cupid in a chariot drawn by swans (Naples, Museo Archeologico Nazionale)\n\nRoman artists Giovanni Battista Piranesi (1720-1778) and Michelangelo Maestri (died 1812 in Rome) created well known images of putti in chariots that were widely circulated and copied at the time. Their inspiration was in turn a Renaissance version of ancient material: their respective compositions are based on Giulio Romano\u2019s (1499-1546) fresco cycle in the <i>salone</i> of the Villa Lante, near Rome (detached in 1890, now Rome, Palazzo Zuccari). Piranesi\u2019s cycle shows his new, distinctly neoclassical style that he had derived from the study of both ancient art and its Renaissance interpretation.\nThe micromosaic version here goes even further in its reduction of lines and colours, and introduces parallel lines throughout the composition: The arms and wings of Cupid are reduced to one, the feet, bodies, necks and heads of the swans are stacked behind one another. \n\nSeveral works in micromosaic of this type are known, most of them either signed or attributed to Giacomo Raffaelli who is credited with the invention of micromosaics and was one of the most celebrated mosaicists around 1800. A signed pair of comparable en grisaille plaques with classical subjects is also in the Rosalinde and Arthur Gilbert Collection, while several micromosaics with a similar blue background and reduced palette are mounted in a pair of console tables by Giacomo Raffaelli at The State Hermitage in St Petersburg. Two plaques with putti in chariot after Giulio Romano are set in chimneypieces in the Old Hermitage building of this institution.\n\n<b>The Rosalinde and Arthur Gilbert Collection</b>\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert (1913-2001) and his first wife Rosalinde (1913-1995) formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes. Arthur Gilbert moved his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
