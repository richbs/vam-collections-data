With music re-written and supplemented by Frederic Austin, Gay's 18th century ballad opera featuring traditional tunes took London by storm and put Hammersmith firmly on the theatrical map.\n\nThe huge popularity of the Beggar's Opera revival which ran for over three years spawned a surprising quantity of figurines in porcelain and wax.  They are an indication of the impact that the production made on designers and artists.  The highly simplified, almost illustrative, quality of the designs was characteristic of British theatrical design in the wake of the impact of the Diaghilev Ballets Russes and in reaction against the detailed 19th century tradition of realism and historicism.  This figurine is one of a set produced around 1920 featuring several of the main characters in the cast.  It is a more finished version than another example of the figurine in the Theatre Collections. [S.866-1981].",

            "history_note": "The figure represents Sylvia Nelis, who played Polly Peachum in the original cast of John Gay's <i>The Beggar's Opera</i> in the celebrated 1920 revival by Nigel Playfair at the Lyric, Hammersmith, designed by Claud Lovat Fraser. The figure came to the Museum as part of the Cyril Beaumont Bequest.\nBeaumont was a friend of Lovat Fraser, who presented him with a small drawing of Macheath (S.412-2000).\nA second copy of the figure in the Museum collections, S.1314-1984, is more highly finished, with painted features.\n\nHistorical significance: The huge popularity of the <i>Beggar's Opera</i> revival spawned a surprising quantity of figures in porcelain and wax.  They are an indication of the impact that the production made on designers and artists.  The highly simplified, almost illustrative, quality of the designs were characteristic of English theatrical design in the wake of the impact of the Diaghilev Ballets Russes and in reaction against the detailed 19th century tradition of realism and historicism.",
