On each side are standing figures of chauri bearers (flywhisk bearers). The first tirthankara is the only one usually shown with hair behind the ears.\nThis rectangular panel has an unadorned surface out of which are carved in deep relief the figure of Rishabhanatha, the first of the twenty-four Jinas, and surrounding attendants.  He is seated in full relief on a beautifully decorated cushion and throne cover which drapes forward, all on throne-stand supported by lions on a plain projecting base. The nude Jina, seated in a meditation posture is framed by an elaborate open-work nimbus which frames the head and shoulders of the image. The inner part of the aureole is decorated with a beaded border surrounding radiating flame motifs, the outer ring being ornamented with a beaded inner margin and foliated decoration. He is shown with his distinguishing tresses of hair falling over his shoulders and a quatrefoil diamond-shaped<i> srivatsa</i> in the middle of his chest. A wheel of law (<i>dharamacakra</i>) is represented at the centre of the throne, a generic emblem of Jina-hood. Demi-gods are seen seated at royal ease flanking the throne, the one on the right representing, the goat-headed Harinegameshin. On each side of the seated Jina are standing flywhisk (<i>chauri</i>) bearers, each with a nimbus, similar to the inner disc of the Jina's. Above two celestial garland-bearers are shown flying in veneration of the Jina in front of branches with drooping leaves, and seated on the honorific triple-umbrella in the centre is a celestial drummer.\n\nUniquely amongst the Jinas, Rishabhanatha is shown wearing long uncut hair, visible tucked behind his ears and falling onto his shoulders. Svetambara sect sources recount that when King Rishabha decided to renounce the world and become an ascetic, his first task was to pull all the hair from his head. However, having removed five handfuls, the god Indra asked him to desist, which he did.",

Svetambara sect sources recount that when King Rishabha decided to renounce the world and become an ascetic, his first task was to pull all the hair from his head. However, having removed five handfuls, the god Indra asked him to desist, which he did.\nHarinegameshin, a goat-headed folk deity, shown in the lower right hand corner of the relief is a protector of women at childbirth and a patron deity of children who was absorbed early into the Jain pantheon. His function is similar to that of Hariti in Buddhism.",
