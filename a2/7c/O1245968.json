Le Quesne in the bottom right hand corner and annotation on the rear suggests it dates from 1897. \n\nIt shows a scene from the Oxford University Dramatic Society's production of The Taming of the Shrew by William Shakespeare (1564-1616) with Miss Marion Morris as Katharina, Mr. Philip Comyns Carr (son of the costume designer Alice Comyns Carr (1850-1927) and the critic and writer Joseph Coymns Carr (1842-1916)) as Petruchio,and Mr. A.R. Mackintosh as Grumio.\n\nThe Oxford University Dramatic Society was founded in 1885 by Alec MacKinnon. Many famous actors have performed in the productions funded by this body and John Gielgud (1904-2000) made his directing debut at OUDS in 1932 with a production of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. \n\nThis item is one of several theatrical drawings from a collection of sketches commissioned from contemporary artists to be printed in illustrated magazines. The collection was donated to the museum by Sir William James Ingram in 1914.",
