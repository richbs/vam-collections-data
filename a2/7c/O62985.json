His most noted projects include the Glasgow School of Art, a number Glasgow tea room interiors and houses, including \u2018Windyhill\u2019 and \u2018The Hill House\u2019, in Helensburg.\n\nThis chair comes from a suite made for Mr and Mrs Sidney Horstman of Bath. In 1917 they commissioned Mackintosh  to renovate the house. Though he worked on a relatively small number of rooms in the house, he created startling differences in each room. The guest bedroom, for which this chair was designed, was decorated with dark mahogany. Some of the larger pieces in the suite were decorated with inlay. The style is very similar to that of a suite designed for the guest bedroom of 78 Derngate, Northampton, the home of Mr and Mrs W.J. Bassett-Lowke. \n\nThe furniture was constructed by Prisoners of War on the Isle of Man in 1917.",
