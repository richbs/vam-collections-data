The lower left/top right lines are in purple; the others are in red, green and dark blue.  Within the lattice the line bears a cross-shaped motif within which, along the line, is a row of three figures - the central octagon is yellow and the outer are in pairs of green or dark blue, all outlined in red.\n\nThe main border (sides and lower edge only) has a green ground with red, stepped lozenges alternating along the sides with opposing pairs of hooked motifs, each in cream and yuellow, and alternating along the lower edge with opposing arrowheads in either cream or yellow.\n\nInner and outer borders are along the sides and lower edge only and have a reciprocal \"running dog\" design in cream and purple.\n\nThe top border extends along the top of the five-sided field and the side borders and is composed of narrow horizontal lozenges in contrasting colours.",
