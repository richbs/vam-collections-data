The mirror faces were polished and, from the 11th century, made more reflective by applying a thin layer of tin. They were lifted and held by a cord which was passed through a hole in the raised boss, which often took the form of a tortoise, on the center back. \n\nAt first, Japanese mirrors were close copies of Chinese and Korean originals, but by the 11th century mirrors with distinctively Japanese designs were being made. This mirror, with its decoration of chrysanthemum flowers by a stream and two small birds, shows how formal Chinese designs were replaced by naturalistic subjects.",
