In the finished work the right leg is bent instead of the left and is supported by a Dolphin.\nA small model for the Neptune statue is known to have been in existence by the end of 1563. Related bronze models are in the National Museum, Stockholm and the Museo Civico, Bologna.\n\nGiambologna (ca. 1524-1608) was born in Flanders. He went to Rome to study antique sculpture from about 1550 to 1553 and then travelled back through Florence where he was persuaded to stay. He became sculptor to the Medici family and consequently  became one of the most influential sculptors of the late 16th and early 17th centuries. He drew attention to many artists  from Northern Europe and disseminated his style mainly through small bronzes. He established an efficient and large workshop.\n\nThe status of the model has been thoroughly discussed by Pope-Hennessy. It has been accepted as the work of Giambologna by most scholars, apart from J.C. Robinson and Keutner, who preferred Ammanati as author. Gramberg identified it as a preliminary sketch for the full-size model of Neptune produced in clay by Giambologna for the competition held in 1560 over who should carve the statue of Neptune for the projected fountain on the piazza della Signoria.",

Robinson and Keutner, who preferred Ammanati as author. Gramberg identified it as a preliminary sketch for the full-size model of Neptune produced in clay by Giambologna for the competition held in 1560 over who should carve the statue of Neptune for the projected fountain on the piazza della Signoria. In the finished work the right leg is bent instead of the left and is supported by a Dolphin. The pose, with left knee flexed and right arm hanging down, has features in common with a bronze statuette from the workshop of Giovanni Bologna in the National Museum in Stockholm, and this is in  turn related to a bronze statuette in the Museo Civico at Bologna, in which the figure is shown with the right knee flexed and the right foot resting on a dolphin, as in the Bologna fountain.",
