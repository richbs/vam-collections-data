The use of techniques such as 'maki-e' (sprinkled picture) to create objects of ornate beauty and utility, as upon this tray, was pivotal to lacquer wares endorsement as a luxury commodity rather than the poor quality, plain wares belonging to the poorer members of society. This tray would have been used to serves sweets and other food types.\n In this depiction of a monkey it can be speculated that the lacquer design attempted to attain a similar level of refinement as painting by mirroring the muted hues, the gradiated tones and the limitless space in its representation. The word monkey in Japanese is pronounced 'saru' and is a homonym of the word 'expel.' Images of monkeys were often utilised to protect against thieves, bad spirits and fire and the monkey's life like depiction and expressive eyes perhaps reflect its protective qualities and inquisitive nature.",
