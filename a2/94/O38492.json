The man, standing at the back of the group, is dark-haired & bearded, & wears a dark suit with a waistcoat; the woman, seated in front of him with flowers in her hands, has brown hair parted in the middle & wears a pagoda-sleeved purple silk dress with gold buttons and an elaborate lace collar & undersleeves, with a gold brooch, bracelet & rings.  All three children wear full-skirted white frocks: the youngest, possibly a boy, has short blonde hair & wears strap slippers & a broad blue & white striped sash & shoulder ribbons.  The other two are girls, with\nlight brown hair worn in ringlets: the elder, seated and holding the kitten, wears a gold brooch at the neck of a lace-trimmed high-necked frock with an embroidered tiered skirt & a white cross-over sash; the younger, who is arranging a rosebud in the elder's hair, wears a low-necked lace-trimmed frock with a tucked skirt & red checked sash above pantalettes & black pumps with white lacy socks.  They are in a conservatory which has glass doors, & a decorative cast-iron drainage grille in the floor.  Two hanging baskets of fuchsias are suspended by the doorway on the left, and a passion-flower trails downward on the right; the group is flanked by plants which include mimulus, camellias,pelargoniums and an arum lily.  The doors are open behind the group, showing a garden with a wide lawn, flower-beds, trees, & a summer-house, with a building of gothic appearance rising\nbehind it, & a romanticised landscape beyond a stone balustrade to the right. The painting is set in its original gilded wooden frame with moulded gesso decoration in the shape of stylized flowers and foliage.",
