Although not designed to be worn, the shoes also illustrate the chogakpo construction technique. This term refers to traditional Korean pathcwork wrpping clothes, which are made from the left-over scraps of material cut into squares, triangles and other geometric shapes and arranged together in mosaic patterns. \n\nOne shoe is predominantly grey silk gauze pieces with further small areas of patchwork in pink, red, yellow, green and turqoiuse. The other shoes is mainly red silk gauze with other areas of patchwork in pink, yellow, orange and green. \n\nChung-Hie Lee is a renowned and highly respected fibre artist. \n\nFor a short well-illustrated discussion of traditional Korean shoes, see: Choe Sang-Su: \"Chaussures\" in Revue Coree vol 17 (1985), pp 61-86.\"",
