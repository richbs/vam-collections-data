It is articulated by three squat Corinthian-type pilasters with a vertical grooves down the central middle part of the shafts, in between of which there are pairs of gesticulating men in apparent lively conversation. They are elaborated in greater detail than those in IM.87-1939 as they are on a larger scale. The two men in the scene on the extreme left carry large circular shields on their left arms. There is a plain plinth running along the bottom edge and a moulding decorated with a leaf motif above a plain fillet along the top.\n      There is a long cramp slot and square-shaped mortice hole at the end on the proper right hand top side and rows of broad vertical chisel marks on the right hand side of the rear.",
