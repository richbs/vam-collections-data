A third eye is visible on the forehead.  The  front right hand is in abhaya mudra; the rear right hand hold the kettledrum (damaru); the rear left, the flame (agni);  the front left is stretched across the body in gaja or danda hasta.  The cobra usually seen on the front right forearm is absent.  The locks of the hair are extended to the sides and bear, on the left side, an image of the river-goddess Ganga, and on the right, a half-moon.  Datura flowers are decked behind the ears.  At the back of the head there is a lrage siras cakra (disc for hanging garlands).  On top of the head there is a bull-like ornament surrounded by a fan of kondrai leaves.  The aureole of flames issues from the mouths of two makaras and is surmounted by a kirti-mukha.  The demon, instead of holding the cobra, has a shield in his left hand and weapon in the right.  The image is mounted on a lotus-pedestal and square base, and on the rim of the lotus-pedestal there is an inscription in Tamil and Grantha characters which reads:\n\" Guru         gurukkal nittam sada servai\"\nThe word guru may represent the planet Venus, and the blank represents an indecipherable number.  The remaining words read,  ' the priest daily and always adores'.\n\nThis is another late and somewhat debased version, probably the work of a local provincial craftsman.",
