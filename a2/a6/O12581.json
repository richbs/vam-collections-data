These range from covering floors and windows and to making bags, boxes and even umbrellas. Paper-making has a long and illustrious history in Korea: that of the Koryo (918-1392) and the Choson (1392-1910) dynasties won the praise of even the Chinese, who were not usually inclined to prize foreign goods. \n\nThese boxes, which fit one into the other much like Russian dolls, were made by a contemporary artist working in the paper-decorating tradition. The skeleton of the boxes is of wood, over which have been pasted a few layers of white paper and finally the coloured papers that form the design. A final lacquer coating acts as a sealant and protector. \n\nThe bright colours of the box are often used in Korean art and culture. Delicate paper-cuts on the top and sides of the lids add visual impact and meaning: the black roundel in the centre of the lid is a stylised version of the Chinese character meaning \"longevity\".",
