BACHIACCA Francesco di Ubertino (1494 or 1495-1557) 25 A soldier drawing his sword: on the ground a furled flag resting upon a drum, a halberd and a pipe or other wind instrument Inscribed in ink in an old hand 'Giorgione' Black chalk 11 x 7 1/2 (280 x 190) D.1025-1900 PROVENANCE G. Vallardi (Lugt 1223); two other illegible and unidentified marks; Dalton Bequest 1900 LITERATURE <i>Dalton Catalogue</i>, p. 14 (as anonymous, Florentine school) The Dalton catalogue is doubtless right in calling the drawing Florentine. The more precise attribution to Bachiacca was tentatively suggested by Popham. The technique, the physical type represented, the pose, the whole feel of the drawing lend some support to this idea. Compare the soldier on horseback in the British Museum (inv. no. 1860-6-16-74: BB. 1938; no. 183, fig. 932); and the bust of a bearded warrior in Windsor Castle (inv. no. 0463; Popham, <i>Windsor</i>, p. 187, no. 68, fig. 21). Compare also the drawing of a standing man in the Albertina (no. 152; reproduced in Anna Forlani, <i>I disegni italiani del cinquecento</i>, Venice, 1962, pl, 48). Pacchia and Alessandro Allori have also been suggested as the author of the drawing.",
