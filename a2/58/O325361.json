Soc. Ant, 2nd S., X, 260-2). A document from the Hatherton archives now in the Stafford County Record Office (D.260 M//F 4B pp. 38-41) gives an acount made in 1760 of the finding of the money but makes no mention at all of the chalice and paten. Actuially there wrere two discoveries of money, one in 1741 and the other in 1749 (and no mention of the discovery of anything in 1750). The descriptions of the coins mention guineas were first coined in the reign of Charles II, and 'johns' in the reign of Joao V of Portugal (1708-1750) it is obvious that the coins can have been hidden for quite a short time only. Since there appears to be no contemporary description of the finding of the chalice and paten, it is possible to doubt whether it was in fact found with the coins. The Littletonsdo not appear ever to have been recusants and the chalice and paten are rather finer than might be expected to be found in the chapel  of a small manor house. It has been suggested (c.c. Oman\"English Church Plate\" 119) that the chalice and paten might originally have belonged to St Thomas's Abbey near Stafford; since at the time of the Dissolution two members of the Littleton family had pieces of the Abby plate in pledge.",
