Indeed, the store's name is stamped indistinctly on the stretcher beneath the seat. Bowman Brothers imported plywood furniture from Finland including many designs by Alvar Aalto, as well as stocking contemporary British furniture by leading-edge manufacturers such as Isokon and more commercial firms like PEL.  For this reason the shop earned a reputation as a champion of modern design.  The chair illustrated in the Bowman's catalogue was described as Finnish, but this is not a design by Alvar Aalto, the best known Finnish designer.  With its cantilevered, unadorned plywood structure, however, it is an interesting example of 1930s modernist design.",
