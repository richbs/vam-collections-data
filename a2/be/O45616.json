Wife of W Alister Macdonald, Water colour Artist.  50 Penywern Road, Earl's Court, London SW5\".  I wrote to the Secretary of the Royal Society of Miniature Painters Sculptors and Gravers to see if he could produce any information from his records but he replied saying that owing to very unfortunate circumstances their records were lost so that they only have Catalogues of the Society's exhibitions for the last 20 years which is after Lucy's death, but adds \"All that is really known here is that she was a highly respected miniature portrait painter whose work was much in demand in her lifetime\".  I found some of her works listed on page 79, vol:V of the \"Royal Academy Exhibitions 1905-1970... I remember her working in the Arlington Galleries which used to be in Bond Street, during the early 1930s.\"",
