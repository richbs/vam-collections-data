            "public_access_description": "Phyllis Ginger studied at the Richmond School of Art between 1932 and 1935. Although her main ambition was to be an illustrator, she was encouraged during her studies to also follow her interests in etching and portraiture. She exhibited for the first time at the Royal Academy in 1938 and was elected to the Royal Watercolour society in 1952. In 1939 Phyllis Ginger was involved in the Pilgrim's Trust scheme 'Recording Britain', which engaged artists to paint topographical views of famous buildings and other characteristic sites considered to be in potential danger of destruction by enemy action.\n\nThis sketch demonstrates Ginger's ability as a topographical artist. The location has not been identified. The scene of a church on the left and a large house on the right with a group of trees in between is typical of the views that Ginger and other artists drew as part of the 'Recording Britain' scheme. The sketch has been done in pencil with pen being used to strengthen the form of the roof and chimney on the left side of the house. Although this watercolour does not relate to Ginger's contributions to the 'Recording Britain' series it demonstrates her perception of characteristic British scenery in the 1940s.",
