The muted table lamp and telephone suggest that the setting is a hotel room but there is no clue as to where in the world this might be.  The viewer is kept in the dark as to what lies beyond the window, seeing only small shafts of light through the blinds. Our alienation from the scene is compounded further as we glimpse only the side of the agent\u2019s face.",
