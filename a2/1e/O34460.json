Helen Chadwick's abiding concern with gender and sexuality is given a playfully subversive twist in this image.  In the exuberent style of Rococco engraved ornament, a frame of ejaculating penises surrounds a radiating central vagina, which is only fully revealed when the artfully positioned ribbon is lifted.",
