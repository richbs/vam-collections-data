She ordered a number of dresses to wear when her husband was appointed ambassador. Born and raised in the US, Lady Makins liked to purchase her summer clothing in the US and her winter clothing in Britain. This dress was designed by Angele Delanghe a London-based designer who had a salon in Fortnum and Mason at the time. The dress model was titled 'Poinsettia'. Lady Makins requested straps to be fitted to the original strapless bodice, this may have been a practical consideration in light of the fact that she and her husband were known for their love of dancing. The dress was inherited by her daughter Mary, the Viscountess Norwich who donated it to the museum. The dress featured in an editorial in March 2013 Harpers Bazaar (British version) shot by photographer Cathleen Naundorf.",
