A.79-1952) are made (signed J.D.) by Jacob Dobbermann in Germany in ca. 1711.\nThe present example represents Louis II, Duke of Bourbon, Le Grand Cond\u00e9.\nIt was previously thought to be a statuette of Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg, made by Fran\u00e7ois Dusart (1620-1688). The accompanying statuette  represents King Henry IV of France.\nJacob Dobbermann (1682-1745) was a Polish amber,- and ivory-carver, active in Germany. He almost certainly came from a family of amber-carver in Danzig. From 1716 onwards he was the court artist of the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel. He is formally documented as 'Bernstein- und helffenbeinarbeiter' at Kassel in 1737. He produced ivory portrait medallions, and numerous reliefs in ivory, often depicting mythological scenes, many of them based on South Netherlandish engraved sources.",
