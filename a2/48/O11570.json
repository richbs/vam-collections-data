While the larger sizes of imported German stoneware bottle would have satisfied most needs, native potters made many plain lead-glazed earthenware jugs for carrying water from the well or carrying liquor to the harvesters in the field. It is mainly the inscribed presents such as this piece that have survived.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThis is a country potter's response to imported German stoneware. Since the basic clay is dark red, the desired treacle-brown colour is produced by adding iron and manganese to the lead glaze, while the decoration is confined to the application of small moulded 'prunts' (protrusions) and some hand-modelling. The precious white pipe-clay has been used sparingly.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe jug itself is entirely functional and practical. However, the decoration contains elements borrowed from a variety of sources. The mask on the front was clearly inspired by stoneware bottles imported from Frechen (in Germany), and the applied medallions can also be traced to this source. The overall covering with prunts is reminiscent of contemporary imported blue and grey stonewares from the Westerwald in Germany. It is unlikely that the Wrotham potters would have been familiar with similar prunts on German glass.",
