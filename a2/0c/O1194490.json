They were made in the 1970s and are manufactured from vinyl. The introduction of vinyl as a key material for manufacturing dolls made them much more accessible as they were cheaper and easier to produce, but also brought about a key differences in the way they were made. for example, hair could be rooted directly into the vinyl head, as can be seen in these dolls, rather than being painted on or requiring a wig. \n\nThe popularity of these modern dolls tend to be much more transient than that of their predecessors, meaning that new models come and go. This set of three girls, perhaps sisters, dressed for rainy days demonstrates the popularity of novelty dolls allowed by the versatility of the material.",
