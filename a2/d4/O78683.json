Unusually this miniature is still in a 17th-century blue enamelled gold locket; many such miniatures have lost their original frames.\n\nPeople\nThis miniature closely resembles the subject of an etching from 1653 by the Bohemian Wenceslaus Hollar, which is said to depict Sir John Wildman.  Wildman was notorious as one of those involved in trying and condemning to death Charles I.  However, the Hollar print was not described as showing Wildman until almost 100 years after Wildman's death.  No other portraits of Wildman are known, so the description must remain doubtful.\n\nAttribution\nThis miniature is signed 'IH' for John Hoskins.  We know that John Hoskins had too much work for one hand and that his son, John Hoskins the Younger, worked in his studio.  But confusingly all works from the Hoskins studio were signed 'IH'.  This miniature has been attributed to Hoskins the Younger because it is like others in a group of miniatures apparently by one hand.  The heart of this group is a miniature signed Ipse ('himself'), which is probably a self-portrait by Hoskins the Younger.  Thus the whole group is believed to be by this artist.",

Graham Reynolds identified the artist and pointed out that the sitter 'closely resembled' the subject of an etching of 1653 by Hollar, which was identified as Wildman, the famous regicide. When the miniature was purchased by the Museum in 1962, CM Kauffmann reviewed the evidence relating to the Hollar image. He noted that it was reproduced in Maurice Ashley's biography of Wildman, but that the first mention of it as a portrait of Wildman was as late as the 1774 Supplement to Granger 1769. The first edition contains no mention of Wildman. Granger's comment on the Hollar etching was: 'I never saw this print at least with a name. It is mentioned in a manuscript catalogue of English heads, by Vertue, which is in my possession' (1) Neither the 1745 nor the 1759 edition of Vertue's <i>A Description of the Work of Wenceslas Hollar</i> (2) identifies the print as Wildman.  \n \nSubsequent editions of Granger (3) include an engraving by W Richardson after Hollar, identified as Wildman. It was this English tradition that Gustav Parthey referred to when, including the Hollar print among the 'Unnamed male heads', he commented: 'Gilt fiir des Bildnis des Major Wildman'. (4)  \n \nNo other portraits are known. Sir Charles Firth's entry on Wildman in the DNB refers to an engraving by Faithorne with the admonitory tag 'Nil admirari', but no impression of this is now retrievable. A miniature, said to be of Wildman by Cooper, 'highly finished in a silver-gilt case' was for sale at 4 gns in 1827.(5) The latter is not now known but the date of its sale suggests that the image could have been checked against the versions of Hollar in Granger. \n \nClearly therefore the identification of this miniature as Wildman is open to doubt.  The tradition on which it is founded is long, but is based on a lost manuscript by Vertue, who on such matters is not always reliable. Further, the date on this miniature is surprisingly early in Wildman's career: according to the DNB he had ceased to belong to Fairfax's Life Guards by October 1647 and had taken on the leadership of the army opposition to negotiations with the King. His fortune appears not to have been made until his successful speculations of 1649 in the forfeit lands of royalists. On the face of it this miniature, in its very expensive locket, looks like the portrait of a well-established man, not of a radical soldier-politician riding the wave of the Revolution.  \n \nThe landscape background, in which Hoskins again demonstrates a debt to Hollar and which seems to include a view of the Tower, could only have been prophetically apt for Wildman: his imprisonment of 1648 was in Newgate, that of 1655 at Chepstow, and it was not until 1661 that he was lodged in the Tower of London. Castle backgrounds are in fact frequent in miniatures by Hoskins and usually seem to have no iconographic significance.  \n \nStylistically, this miniature is related to a substantial group of miniatures all similarly signed <i>IH</i> and dated from the mid-l 640s (e.g., <i>Unknown Woman called Princess Elizabeth</i>, dated 1645) (6) to the late 1650s (e.g., <i>Unknown Man aged 67</i> of 1658), (7) and perhaps including Cat. Nos 30 and 32. The group centres on the 'Ipse' portrait of 1656 in the Buccleuch Collection, which arguably establishes the artist of the whole group as John Hoskins the Younger.

The early impressions bear no name, but from the second half of the 18th century the engraving became known as a portrait of Wildman (see the Rev. James Granger, <i>Biographical History of England</i>, 1774, <i>Supplement</i> p.296; 1824, illustrated ed. Vol. II, part III, p.207). \n \n<u>Provenance:</u> Miss Armorel Carey in 1946; sold by private treaty to the Museum, February 1962.",
