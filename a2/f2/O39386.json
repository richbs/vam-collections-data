            "public_access_description": "The decoration of this F\u00fcrstenberg cup and saucer has been inspired by the much earlier Vienna factory of Du Paquier.  Country scenes in monochrome iron red had been made popular there by the famous decorator Carl Wendelin Anreiter in the 1720s.  The scattered insects, copied after earlier engravings were also a regular feature of decoration on Vienna porcelain.  The decorator at F\u00fcrstenberg however, has modernised the style by giving the landscape scenes an exuberant framework of scrolls, fruits and flower in the newly fashionable rococo style.\n\nF\u00fcrstenberg lies in the centre and slightly to the north of modern-day Germany in  the Harz mountains.  A pottery had been established there in 1744 by the ruler,  Duke Charles I of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel with the aim of stimulating industry in  his domain.  The Duke was a great patron of the arts and sciences and many  writers, philosophers and artists were attracted to his court at Braunschweig  (Brunswick).  Porcelain production in the duchy was only made possible however,  when the 'arcana' or secret recipe for porcelain developed over many years at  Meissen, slowly leaked out.  In 1719 the Vienna factory of Du Paquier was set up  by workers who absconded from Meissen.  Many years later, in 1750 a potter at  Vienna called J.J.  Ringler defected and travelled around Europe setting up  factories wherever he could find patrons.  The first factory  to be established by  him was at H\u00f6chst in 1750.  The manager there, Johann Benckgraff, in turn defected  to F\u00fcrstenberg, together with his son-in-law Johann Zeschinger, a  painter, and Simon Feilner, a modeller.  The link between the F\u00fcrstenberg factory and Vienna perhaps explains the choice of decorative scheme used to decorate this cup and saucer made in the first years of the factory's production. Subsequently, it was the Meissen factory which exerted the greatest influence on the wares made at F\u00fcrstenberg.  Porcelain is still made at F\u00fcrstenberg  today.",
