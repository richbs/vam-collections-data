It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years. Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nThe Queen's Husband, a comedy by Robert E. Sherwood, originally opened in London at the Ambassadors Theatre in October 1931, produced by Barry Jones and Maurice Colbourne. Barry Jones was a great success as King Eric VIII, the perplexed king of an imaginary island state who changes from hen-pecked husband to monarch after a revolution that happens when the Queen is in America. It transferred to the New Theatre in March 1932 with Jones as the King, but R. Lindsell Stuart took the part when it went to Brighton, and Donald Fergusson played the Prime Minister.",
