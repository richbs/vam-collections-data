In Russia in the 16th and 17th centuries both men and women wore them, and some silversmiths worked exclusively as earring makers.  By the 19th century they were only worn by women.  \n\nFrom the early 18th century the design of Russian earrings followed two paths.  The Russian aristocracy increasingly wore earrings of international design, but the rural population kept to the old traditional patterns.  These earrings in traditional styles were made by local silversmiths, who rarely marked their work.  As a result, it is very difficult to tell the difference between old earrings and traditional earrings in the old style.  \n\nThe design of earrings like these, with square pendants set with gems, and smaller drops hanging from their lower edge, first appeared at the beginning of the 18th century.  It remained popular until the 20th century, not only with Russian traditional dress, but also in the Balkans.  The use of lower cost materials in these earrings, to imitate rubies and emeralds, is typical of traditional jewellery of all kinds.",
