The fact the (sic) the state of the designs ranges from rough sketches to finished drawings and proofs allows the pieces to document the design process very closely.'\n\nThis photograph is of an interlaced panel in mahogany carved by George Alfred Rogers (b.1837 - after 1909), the brother of WH Rogers.  George Alfred Rogers adopted his father's profession of wood carving.  His father was the famous wood carver William Gibbs Rogers.",
