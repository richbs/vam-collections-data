            "physical_description": "Carved chair of sgabello type, the panelled back carved with scrolling leafwork between caryatid stiles, the front with a cartouche bearing an eagle badge (for Bagnani?), between two caryatids.\n\nThe curved back piece consists of two triangular floating panels with scrolling leafwork on a punched background within a framework of stiles (caryatids with bead necklaces, and swag of fruit and flowers, on a scroll \u2018leg\u2019, and foot in the form of a bearded head), a muntin (moulded, and with carved lobe motif), a top rail carved with alternating flower heads and dragon head terminals, which supports a crest section with scrolls centred on an angel head. The back is plain on its reverse saved for ogee mouldings on the stiles and muntin.\n\nThe front support is vase shaped, and carved in low relief with a central cartouche (topped by a mask) bearing a badge (a crowned eagle with wings outstretched). The cartouche is centred between two winged caryatids with bead necklaces, linked by a swag of fruits. Along the top runs gadrooning below acanthus. The twin feet are decorated with scrolls, leaf ornament and berries. \n\nThe back support is shaped to match the outline of the front support, but is otherwise plain on both surfaces.\n\nThe seat is formed from a board of lobed outline (made up of two glued boards), pierced at the back to receive the seat back. A central, circular recess with flower head motif, bordered with leaf and dart has a wide, lobed border of bound C scrolls, which are repeated in an extension behind the seat-back. The seat edge is carved with fluting and tongue.\n\nThe two matching side rails are cut on the underside in an ogee arch, but are otherwise plain. \n\nStructure\nThe chair consists of four boards (back, seat, back support and front support)  and two short reinforcing rails, which are pegged together. The front and back  supports are shallow-morticed, then pegged (and probably glued) onto the side rails, and the seat is pegged onto the rails. The back piece is jointed through the seat by 3 dowel prolongations of the stiles (presumed to be modern repairs). \n\nThe carving  has been carried out with a variety of chisels and gouges.\n\nFinish\nThick dark varnish covers all the exposed areas. \n\nReplacements parts and interventions\nOn this example the back and possibly the seat appear to be 16th century, while the other parts are probably 19th century. Some softwood infill on the underside of the seat.",

They have long been known as sgabelli,  ultimately derived from the word scabellum  (Latin for 'stool'). In Venice they  often stood in sets along the walls of the portego. This was a long room, bright  with reflected natural light or candlelight that was used for family celebrations,  display and hospitality. Here the chairs could be moved around, and seat- cushions added as occasion demanded.\n\nThis sgabello was one of about 35 belonging to Jules Soulages  (1803-1856), a lawyer from Toulouse, whose collection was bought piecemeal by  this museum, after being exhibited at Marlborough House between December 1856 and January 1857. Many pieces, including this example, were heavily restored, or made up of a mixture of original and replacement parts.",
