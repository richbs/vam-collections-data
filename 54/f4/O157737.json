            "public_access_description": "Floral still lifes against a black background were a common subject for micromosaics in the late 19th century, and offered an opportunity to demonstrate the brilliant colours of the glass tesserae. This example is comparatively large, and depicts an arrangement of flowers dominated by blues and reds. Lilies and hydrangeas are depicted with other flowers in what appears to be a typical Victorian composition. Small micromosaics with floral still lifes were produced from as early as the 1830s. These mosaics are often in a landscape format and show arrangements of roses, tulips and other flowers in shallow baskets.\n\nFederico Campanilli at the Vatican Workshop specialised in floral subjects during the second half of the century. Contracts for flower mosaics by him survive in the archive of the Vatican Workshop, and date from 1858 to 1864. His work can be compared stylistically, but differs from still lifes like this one in the sense that additional motifs - such as birds and other animals - were used as part of the composition.\n\nThe oval picture is only a partial micromosaic. The tesserae are comparatively large with dimensions of up to 1cm in length and show a very expressive palette with only a few shades of each key colour. Multicoloured tesserae have been used extensively. Whilst the lower part of the picture with the flowers and the ledge has been rendered as a mosaic, the black background is slate. The practice of inlaying mosaics in stone plaques can be found chiefly on smaller pieces such as paperweights, but also on other floral still lifes of larger dimensions. It might have its origins in the use of the motif on small-scale plaques for jewellery where micromosaics were inlaid in monochrome black glass backings from the mid-19th century.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes. Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",

The first micromosaics were created in the 18th century, but it was not until Arthur Gilbert himself became interested in collecting them and invented the term 'micromosaics' that they became known as such. The tesserae are minute pieces cut from thin pieces of glass known as smalti filati, and some of the finest micomosaics can consist of as many as 5,000 tesserae per square inch (ca. 3 by 3cm). By the late 18th century Rome had become central to the production of micromosaics and sold them as souvenirs to wealthy foreigners visiting the city. From small elegant snuffboxes to large monumental tabletops, micromosaics could be used to decorate objects of all shapes and sizes. They could even be made to resemble full-sized canvas paintings, and indeed Arthur Gilbert himself mistook his very first micromosaic for a painting. When he brought it home to show his wife, he had to convince her that it was not in fact a cracked painting, as she supposed, but a mosaic.",
