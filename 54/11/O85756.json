He was billed as \u2018The Greatest Facial Artiste of the Age\u2019. It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre. He compiled them in a series of albums.\n\nAmann\u2019s act was that of an impressionist, although he was variously called an \u2018Expressionist\u2019 and a \u2018Facial Artist and Impersonator\u2019. He did lightning make-up changes on stage. His performance at Hanley was praised for his powerful facial expression, and the way that he gave \u2018really lifelike character sketches of the men who have been leading the world in recent times, as well as featuring well-known types of mankind\u2019. He is surrounded in this drawing by images of Napoleon, Gladstone, Lord Kitchener and Edward VII, some of his subjects of impersonation. Amann was one of several similar performers about 1900. Others included George Moore \u2018the Facial King\u2019, Adelina, \u2018Female Facialist and Quick Change Artiste\u2019 and John Cronow, \u2018The World\u2019s Greatest Facial Expert\u2019.",

The caricature comes from the second album of caricatures in a collection of albums owned by the Theatre Museum compiled by the graphic artist George Cooke.  It is labelled by the artist 'Geo Cooke HYS BOOKE' and features music hall performers working in the early 20th century.",
