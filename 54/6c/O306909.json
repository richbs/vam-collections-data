            "public_access_description": "This practical flower vase was made in two parts, the upper part could be filled with earth and used for growing bulbs as their roots could grow down through the holes in its base and take up water poured into the pierced lower section.  When bulbs were out of season, it could be used for fresh flowers or for porcelain flowers mounted on painted metal stems, thousands of which were made by the factory.  This shape was always known as 'hollandois' (Dutch) at Vincennes/S\u00e8vres as it was probably inspired by contemporary Dutch bulb pots made in tin-glazed earthenware.  When it was made, it probably had a pair with matching decoration, or may have been one of a set of three vases of the same shape, the central one being taller and wider.  The model was first introduced in 1754 in three sizes (this example is the second size) and was so popular it was still being made in 1790s.\n\nThe different elements of this vase, its undulating form, the pink ground colour, the enamelled decoration of a sweet Cupid emblematic of 'Love' and flowers, edged with gilded flowers, leaves and scrolls, all together epitomise the rich, decorative Rococo style of the Louis XV period in eighteenth century France.",

David Peters confirms this and suggests the branch mark may be linked to Noualhier, adding 'It appears on good quality flower-decorated items in the period 1754-65'.  The identity of the figurative painter is unknown.\n\nIn the Jones catalogue (see below) there is an anecdote that Mr Jones refused \u00a31600 for this piece.",
