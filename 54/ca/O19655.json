ISBN 1851773088.\nThe Museum bought this pot by Lucie Rie following a major Rie retrospective exhibition at the Museum in 1982. At the same time, the artist donated a group of her pots made in the 1920s and 1930s in her native Vienna. Towards the end of her career, Rie had come to be regarded as the greatest potter working in England. She was particularly championed by those who considered the Oriental styles of Bernard Leach (see cat. 176) and his followers to be overly restrictive. Working in a central London studio and buying her materials ready-made from industrial suppliers - she remarked of this vase that \"the pink comes from the chemist\" - Rie diverged from Leach in her approach to her work. She was a pragmatist, decidedly not of the \"lifestyle\" school of potters - epitomised by Leach - who believed the spiritual ways in which they lived their lives infused and shaped their work. As a consequence, she has been characterised as a \"modernist\" in contrast to the \"traditionalist\" Leach and has been criticised by purists for eroding traditional values. Yet she took inspiration from the same Chinese Song wares that inspired Leach and, like him, spent her entire life making useful tablewares or decorative vessels, all of them wheel-thrown. This vase, although entirely original, nonetheless echoes twelfth-century Chinese porcelains in its shape, medieval Persian ceramics in its colouring, and contemporary European art in its textures and softly distorted form.\n\nOLIVER WATSON",
