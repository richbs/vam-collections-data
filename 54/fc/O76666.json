Carpets or embroidered cloths [which are easier to carry around] are often used to define a person's space during Muslim prayer rituals. The arch is usually understood to represent the mihrab or decorative panel in the wall of a mosque which indicates the direction of Mecca. This carpet has an arch, but only a subtle border divides the field of octagons from the arch, which in this example is rectangular, and the spandrels.  The row of white octagons above and below the field are worked in single soumak with the coloured weft encircling each warp thread.",
