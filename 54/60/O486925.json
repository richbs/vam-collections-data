The strips of black lacquered cloth that protect the rim and strengthen the joins between the base and the walls have been left intentionally visible, further increasing the sense of immediacy and spontaneity.",

Kado, a native of Wajima, found the inspiration for the very different style of his new work in the large, roughly lacquered food bowls that used to be made for local consumption in the nearby village of Yanagida.",
