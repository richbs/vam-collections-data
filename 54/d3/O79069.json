Their name implies that such clocks stood on brackets, and sometimes matching brackets were supplied by the clock maker.  More often, however, these clocks had no fixed position and were moved from one place to another.  \n\nPeople\nBoth the clock and its movement are signed by James Markwick the Younger.  Markwick was admitted to the Freedom of the Clockmakers' Company in 1692 and became a Master in 1720.  His father, James Markwick, was also a clockmaker (see museum no. 1148-1893).\n\nTrading\nDuring the first half of the 18th century a thriving trade in clocks developed between England and Turkey, and also Spain. Clocks made for the Turkish market  were often engraved with Arabic numerals. Their cases were usually japanned and fitted with brass or silver mounts (see also museum no. 365-1897).  Sealing-wax red, which was an English speciality, appears to have been a popular colour.  Combined with gold, it evoked a sense of luxury and exoticism.  Perhaps it was this that so appealed to the Turkish and Spanish markets.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe case decoration is typical of the Chinoiserie style, which imitated or evoked Chinese art. The cloudbands on the top and base, and the rocks, flowers and dragonflies to the left and right of the dial, are all features of Chinoiserie design, while the gold diaper pattern, brass scrollwork and torch-bearing cherubs are European motifs.",
