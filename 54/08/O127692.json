She wrote the majority of the twenty-three Original Peter Rabbit Books between 1901 and 1913.  The Tale of Peter Rabbit (Frederick Warne, 1902) is her most famous and best-loved tale.  \n\nAs well as an accomplished story-teller, Beatrix Potter was also a keen nature artist.  Her menagerie of pets included rabbits, frogs, squirrels, mice and hedgehogs. When illustrating her tales she would always sketch her fictional characters from live models and often depicted real places in the backgrounds.\n\nDuring the summer of 1891, the Potter family visited Bedwell Lodge, Hertfordshire.  Beatrix Potter produced several sketches of the potting-shed, including this imaginative drawing of two rabbits potting geraniums.  The potting-shed at Bedwell Lodge inspired Beatrix Potter's illustration of Mr. McGregor's tool-shed in The Tale of Peter Rabbit.  In the story, Peter Rabbit runs into the tool-shed to escape from Mr. McGregor and hides inside a watering-can.",
