It was thrown and assembled by Vegas in under 60 seconds as part of a challenge he set to potters Peter Starkey and Morgen Hall. The teapot was subsequently fired by Babs Haenen.\n\nThe teapot is often regarded as the most challenging of ceramic forms. Made up of several functional parts; body, spout, handle, lid and internal strainer, the teapot can be complicated to perfect if it is to be practical as well as aesthetic. Teapots can be hand-made by throwing or modelling each component part and then joining the parts together, as is common in studio ceramic practice. It is also possible to use moulding techniques, often employed by industry. Usually a combination of these methods is used to produce a particular shape or design.",
