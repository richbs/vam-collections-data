He was billed as \u2018Comedian, Vocalist and Story Teller\u2019. It is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre. He compiled them in a series of albums.\n\nRyland always carried a cane on stage, and often wore a straw hat, a loud blazer, a red cummerbund and wide trousers with large turn-ups known as Oxford bags. He often tried to mislead the audience into believing that the limelight was the large pale moon, which may explain the moon shape in the background of this caricature. One person remembered seeing him perform at the Dudley Empire, when the theatre\u2019s much-vaunted sliding roof failed to close quickly enough during a thunderstorm, making the audience very wet. He was on the bill at the Grand with Gilbert Girard and Joe Peterman, both of whom were also drawn by Cooke.",

He often tried to mislead the audience into believing that the lime-light was the large pale moon, which may explains the moon shape against which he is standing in this caricature.  One contemporary remembered seeing him perform at Dudley Empire when the theatre's much-vaunted sliding roof didn't close quickly enough during a thunderstorm.",
