Each loop on the lower pentagon holds a filigree leaf, with a loose ball below it.  The loops on the upper pentagon are similar, except that the central one holds a disc which supports the lower pentagon.  There is a loop for suspension at the top of each pentagon.  The loop at the top of the upper pentagon is attached to a short length of loop-in-loop chain with a hook of bent wire at its top.  There is a wire ring, open at one side, also attached to the upper loop.",

They were particularly renowned for the quality of their filigree work, which was worn and appreciated as much by Muslim as by Jewish women.\n\nThis delicate pendant is typical of the kind of fine filigree made by Jewish silversmiths in the 19th century.  It would have been one of a pair made to hang either side of the face like earrings.  The circular wire may have been fastened into the ear, while the hook at the top was attached to the head covering, to help support its weight.\n\nIt was described as an engagement earring worn by Jewish women when it was acquired by the Museum in 1914.",
