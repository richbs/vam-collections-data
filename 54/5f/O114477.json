Madame Gr\u00e8s was famous for her classicism. She draped and moulded jersey, silk and wool, her favourite fabrics, into precise configurations to achieve an elegant simplicity. \n\nThis dress was probably designed at the very end of the 1950s and shows the fitted shape which was first introduced by Dior after the Second World War, combined with the new shorter lengths of the end of the decade.",
