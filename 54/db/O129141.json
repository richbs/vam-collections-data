However, many of the artists who designed ukiyo-e prints during the Edo Period (1615-1868) also painted pictures. These paintings were not meant to be used as designs for prints, as these were generally based on much freer sketches. Instead, they were individual works, purchased by a wealthier clientele.\n\nWorking with ink on silk, Hiroshige uses light strokes to show sea fortifications off the coast of the city of Edo (modern-day Tokyo). \n\nThe sudden arrival of American 'Black Ships' in Uraga Harbour in 1853 presaged the end of over two hundred years of self-imposed national seclusion. Nervousness about the country's security soon led to the building of sea fortifications in Edo Bay. In this painting, their presence casts an uncertain air over an otherwise peaceful water scene.",
