The lid knob is in the shape of a lotus bud.\n\nTime\nThis vase was made during the early years (1736-1750) of the reign of the Qianlong emperor (reigned 1736-1795), a time that saw a developing taste for Chinese objects and fashions among Europeans. The period also marked a defining point in the direct encounter between China and the West. The Macartney embassy, named after its leader, George, 1st Earl Macartney, voyaged to China and back between 1792 and 1794.  It was the first occasion on which British diplomats, well-versed in the ideas of the European Enlightenment, met the head of the most populous country on earth. Free trade was the mission's goal, but the Chinese emperor was not enthusiastic, and Macartney returned home a disappointed man.\n\nMaterials & Making\nDivision of labour was well established at Jingdezhen, the vast kiln complex where this vase was made. In the course of its production, a piece of porcelain passed through many hands in tightly organised workshops. Once the workshops had completed orders to supply the imperial court, Chinese entrepreneurs were free to control subsequent output.",
