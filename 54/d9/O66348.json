Summer here is represented through Ceres and Triptolemus. Together with 'Autumn' and 'Winter' (in private property) they exactly match the series of four seasons acquired in 1825 for the Royal collection at Windsor.\nThe bronzes were suspected of being 19th century copies by comparison with the versions at Windsor, to which they are much inferior. Correspondence preserved in the Royal Archive at Windsor Castle shows that in October, 1875 the Queen gave permission for the London founder Henry J. Hatfield to copy the four groups at Windsor for Baron Lionel de Rothschild, and the permission was again given for them to be copied by Hatfield for Baron Albert de Rothschild in 1882. \nThe bronze and its pair were apparently cast after this Windsor groups. Versions of the groups were described in the sale catalogue of the Gaignat Collection in 1769 as the 'work of Desjardins'. In recent years the groups have been attributed on the basis of their design to Philippe Bertrand (1663-1724).",
