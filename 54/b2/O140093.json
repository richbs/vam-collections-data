The play, first performed in 2001, is a black comedy based on the exploits of political spin doctors of the New Labour party. Set during a party conference, the characters attempt to hide a scandal so that the party will stay in power result in escalating threats and sleaze.\n\nThe image on the poster, showing the back of a suited man with one hand behind his back crossing his fingers, is designed to call to mind a politician. The balloons floating upwards are an indication that this politician is of the Labour party, as they are the party's representative red colour. The crossing of fingers can symbolize two things; it is both an indication of wishing for good luck, and that the speaker is not telling the truth. The play explored both of these concepts within Tony Blair's Labour party, which at this point had been in power for four years.",
