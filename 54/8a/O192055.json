            "public_access_description": "The Communist Party of Lithuania predicted it would lose the elections to the Supreme Soviet of the LSSR in 1990 because of the massive popular support for the opposition movement Sajudis. These were the first elections to the legislature in which opposition parties participated. However some people agreed with the more moderate slogans of communists which advocated compromise with Moscow. The Communist Party of Lithuania had gained legitimacy in the eyes of the public by separating from the Communist Party of the USSR in 1989. In addition, 20% of the Lithuanian population were \u2018Russophones\u2019 (people with cultural and linguistic ties to Russia) and the more liberal among this group supported the Lithuanian Communist Party line. \n\nThe Russophones in Lithuania, including Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians (along with Lithuanian Poles, who felt they had similar interests), preferred to live within the USSR and spoke only Russian. Hearing Sajudis\u2019s ideas about Lithuanian independence and the reinstatement of Lithuanian as the state language they formed an organisation, prompted by Moscow, to oppose Sajudis. In order to attract as large a number of people as possible, the organisation was given a trilingual name signifying \u2018unity\u2019 in Lithuanian, Russian and Polish: Vienybe \u2013 Yedinstvo \u2013 Jiednosc. \n\nA specially designed trilingual series of posters promoted Communist Party candidates. The background of the posters is formed by front covers from the main newspapers belonging to the three linguistic groups. Superimposed over the newspaper sheets is the Lithuanian flag and the slogan 'Sovereignty. I am for the realistic way'. Here the \u2018realistic way\u2019 was understood as the route of compromise with Moscow. \n\nThe poster was prepared for printing as a collage with text made from re-photographed letters or written in hand with a brush and gouache. It was published by the state publisher Mintis, and was designed by a young artist Dainius Pa\u0161kevicius. \n\nDainius Pa\u0161kevicius (b. 1958) graduated from the Graphic Arts Department at the State Art Institute in Vilnius in 1983. During the years of national revival he worked for the state publisher Mintis as an editor and contributed significantly to the design of posters published during that period. He now works primarily as a book designer.",
