Not enough survives for us to understand its original context but it may have formed part of an armorial display. Putti were popular decorative features in post-medieval artworks and are often found on stained glass panels. \n\nThe fragment was painted with only a simple brown/black pigment. This type of painted decoration is known as 'grisaille'.\n\nThe Netherlands glass workshops produced a large amount of painted glass. Many of these were commissions from civic, mercantile and church officials within the Netherlands but also from abroad.",
