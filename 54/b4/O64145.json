The evening was in the presence of His Excellency the Lord Lieutenant and Her Grace The Duchess of Abercorn and featured the comedy The Wonder! A Woman Keeps a Secret! by Susanna Centilevre, concluding with the new 'musical vaudeville' Bulliondust's Bargain.  Incidental music at the end of the programme was by Zollen, Adams, Mendelssohn, Verdi and Brahms.  The theatre's manager is noted as Mr. M.R. Gunn and the Acting Manager as Mr. Stanley Dust.  The programme was printed by E. Congdon & Co., of South King Street, and the performance may possibly have taken place in Manchester, which had both a Theatre Royal and a South King Street in the 19th century.",
