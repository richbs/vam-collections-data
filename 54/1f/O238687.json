This is a preliminary design by Vardy from architect and designer William Kent's (1685-1748) original design. The design is not known to be executed in gold, but an example in silver, with a modified handle, was made by George Wickes for Sir John Hanbury Williams in 1745. \n\nKent visited Rome in 1715 where he met Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington who became his patron. Boyle encouraged Kent's interest in architecture when they returned to London together and Kent soon started receiving commissions for buildings and furniture in the classical style. His most famous buildings include Holkham Hall, Norfolk, and the Horse Guards, Whitehall.",
