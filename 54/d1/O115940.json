Upper: 1.5 cm. plain weave with white cotton weft begins immediately after one line of stitches in red and light blue wool taken over 6 warp threads;  wefts then plaited horizontally from right to left and falling into a fringe of 9 cms maximum and partly missing.\n\nDesign:  field: dark orange ground with maximum-sized rectangular medallion with a central, dark orange cross; regular crenellated indentations along the sides of the medallion provide field space for dark blue leaves and a light blue boteh in each corner, also for small rosettes, S shapes, etc.  These also occur throughout the medallion which has an inward-pointing, multi-coloured cypress at top and bottom centre.  To either side a blue vase holds a sprig of four peonies and is supported on both sides by a small horned animal.  Towards the central cross are two pairs of peacocks and two blue birds; there are other small birds and floral sprigs.  Along the sides, dark orange and light blue leaves are similar to the blue leaf within the four points of the cross, which faces towards a small yellow central rosette, and pair with those in the outer field.\n\nMin border:  dark blue ground with peonies in various colours alternating with brightly-coloured small birds accompanied by S motifs.\n\nInner and outer borders: light pink ground with a black zigzag bearing both small and very small green leaves.",
