In the centre is a large silver-gilt 8-petalled rosette over an 8-lobed coloured silk rosette in white, pink, dark and light blue.  The rosette centre is worked in silver thread.  A long serrated leaf stem in silver-gilt emerges from the four cardinal points and extends to just short of the border.  In each of the four remaining corners there is an ovoid shaped silver-gilt flower with 8 petals and two curving flowering branches in silver point to the small corner 7-petalled rosette and two buds.  The metal thread is couched with a twill pattern sometimes forming chevrons. There are coloured silk details in the flowers and buds.  The border is a gentle meander with large serrated leaves.  There is a large composite blossom in each corner and 8-petalled rosettes on the meander.\nThe red satin ground has been pieced before being embroidered in one section, otherwise it has been assembled after being embroidered and may have been patched. The metal thread has been laid and couched ie. white silk threads or brown silk threads have been laid onto  the ground and  then metal thread has been couched over the top at right angles to create a raised or padded effect.\nThe ground fabric has a red silk warp and pink silk weft.\nThe embroidery silk is 2Z and is probably split stitch.\nSilver strip open S-wound on white Z-twist silk core and silver-gilt strip close S-wound on light brown Z-twist silk.\nFacing: bias-cut silk and cotton ikat; stripes in white, blue, green, red and yellow.\nBacking: cream cotton, pieced, with a woven leafy meander over which has been roller printed a design of red and light brown feathery flowers with blue details.\nThere is an interlining. Five green silk twill tabs have been attached along one edge.  The same sort of twill has been used to attach tabs to 855-1897 and so was presumably done in the museum for display purposes.",
