It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years.  Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nIrene Vanbrugh starred in Miss Nell O'New Orleans as Nelly Daventry, with the Manchester-born actor George Zucco (1886-1960) as George Durand.  Zucco spent the early years of his career in Canada and America, and returned to England after service in France in the First World War.  He made his name on the London stage in the 1920s and 1930s, spending much of his career after 1936 in Hollywood where he appeared in numerous films. The Brighton cast was advertised as the full London company, and prior to Brighton the play had run for over 300 nights at the Garrick and Duke of York's Theatres.",
