The richly coloured ribbons were sewn together, and then the fabric was accordion-pleated. The double-layered cape and ruffled collar are one continous piece of fabric. The lightweight silk fabric clings to the wearer on the underlayer, whilst the top layer hangs in stiff, rigidly sculptural folds.\n\nMatilda Etches is now almost entirely forgotten except as a theatre, ballet and opera costume-maker. However, she was an extremely talented couturier, whose fashionable clothes were innovative and very carefully made. The design for the 'Butterfly' cape was patented in 1953 - this is a 1949 prototype. When she donated a selection of her work to the Museum in 1969, this cape and a dress, 'West African' (see T.186-1969) were shown to senior Museum officials as key acquisitions. They were the first modern fashion items to be accorded this honour.",
