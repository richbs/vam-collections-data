An interesting feature is the detachable sleeves which allow the dresss to be adapted for evening wear and demonstrate the economical use of clothing in the early 19th century.  There is also evidence that this dress may have been reused at a later date as the lacing at the back and whalebone struts are consistent with fashions of the 1890s.  This adds to its cultural value and interest to researchers as well as the general public. Although our wedding dress collection is large, the early 19th century is not well represented.",

This was a popular colour as it implied purity, cleanliness and social refinement\n\nQueen Victoria helped popularise the fashion for white when she got married in 1840.  She set a royal precedent by choosing a simple ivory satin dress which was very much in the fashions of the day.  Earlier royal brides had worn white but their dresses were often woven or heavily embroidered with gold or silver.\n\nWeddings were one of the most festive social occasions.  They gave families the chance to show off their wealth and even less well-off couples would make an effort to dress appropriately Not everyone, however, wore white.  Widows, older brides and the less well-off often preferred more practical coloured gowns.  These could then be worn for Sunday best long after the marriage.  They would not have looked out of place as wedding dresses in the 19th century were designed in line with the current fashions.\n\nWedding dresses are one of the rare types of garment for which the name of the wearer and the date of her marriage are often recorded.",
