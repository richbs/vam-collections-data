It is carved in the shape of the character Judy from the traditional Punch and Judy that was popular as a glove puppet show in the 19th century. In Punch and Judy shows Judy is careful of her baby, which Mr. Punch traditionally throws out of the booth. The baby that Judy is colliding in this etui is a miniature version of Mr. Punch.\n\nPunch and Judy shows are a feature of British seaside  entertainment  whose history in Great Britain stretches back to the puppet show that Samuel Pepys noted  seeing in Covent Garden on 9 May 1662 performed by the Italian puppeteer Signor  Bologna.  This included a marionette, or string puppet as Pulcinello or Punch, but by the 19th century  Punch was more usually a glove puppet, performed in a portable booth by one performer who  had a character on each hand. Punch became a popular character in Britain by the 19th century, when images of Punch and  Judy were used as decorative motifs on a range of household items. In 1841 the magazine Punch, or the London Charivari was established, named after the comic and anarchic character  of Mr. Punch whose image appeared on its cover.",
