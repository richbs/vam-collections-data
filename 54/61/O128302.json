She was voted 'Best Dressed Woman' in the world by Time magazine in 1962, second only to Jacqueline Kennedy.\n\nGloria Guinness kept a full wardrobe in each of her seven homes, so that she would never have to pack.  She saw haute couture as an art form and patronised many couture houses. \n\nThis embroidered evening dress by Christian Dior (1905-57) was a special commission.  It is a variation of a dress featured in Dior's spring/summer collection of 1954, called Belle de Nuit but Mrs. Guinness had the skirt lengthened and the bolero added.  This would have greatly increased the cost, as embroidery was an expensive and time consuming addition.  She may have been so taken with it because it was in yellow - a colour she favoured as it suited her dark hair.",

Born in Mexico as Gloria Rubio, her first husband was a Count Furstenberg, to whom she was married at the behest of the German art collector, Freddy Horstmann.  Her second husband was an Egyptian by the name of Fakhry, and her third husband, the banker Loel Guinness.  In many ways she was unhappy as his wife, as she loved to party and he did not.  She gave an enormous number of items from Balenciaga, Dior, Courreges, Lanvin Castillo, Givenchy, Hellstern and Jeanne Lafaurie, proving that she spread her commissions amongst many different couturiers.  Among the 17 outfits, 12 hats and pairs of shoes that she donated were a 1948 Balenciaga evening gown (T.16-1974) of organdie with flack flowers, a 1949 hand-painted evening gown by Marcelle Chaumont (T.92-1974), and a 1950s evening gown by Jeanne Lafaurie (T.281-1974), the only dress by that designer in the V&A's collection.",
