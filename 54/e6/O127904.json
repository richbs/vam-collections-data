Studied at Cork School of Art 1822; moved to London 1827, entering RA Schools 1828 and won many prizes. Exhibited 84 works at the RA between 1829 and 1870, 20 at the BI 1832-44, and 21 (mostly watercolours) at the SBA 1830-71. Early subjects included portraits, later predominantly literary and historical. Elected ARA 1835, RA 1840. Visited Paris 1830, 1844, 1850, Brussels 1845, Italy 1855, Germany 1859. Executed vast wall paintings for the Palace of Westminster 1846-65. Friend of John Forster and Dickens. Contributed (as 'Alfred Croquis') caricatures to Erases's Magazine 1830-8; illustrated several books, including Dickens's Christmas books, Moore's Irish Melodies (1845), B\u00fcrger's Leonora (1847), Tennyson's Princess (1860). Declined to be proposed PRA 1866; supposedly refused a knighthood. Died Chelsea, London, 25 April 1870; his studio sale was at Christie's 24 June 1870. His portrait by E M Ward 1846 is in the NPG; there are letters to Forster in the National Art Library, and many drawings and watercolours in the V&A collections. \nLIT: \t'Autobiography' (MS, RA Library: see E Kenealy in Dublin University Magazine XXIX, 1847, pp594-607); Athenaeum 30 April 1870, pp586-7 (obit); Art ]ournal 1870, pp 181-2 (obit); W J O'Driscoll A Memoir of Daniel Maclise RA 1872, p187; J Dafforne Pictures by Daniel Maclise 1871; R L Ormond 'Daniel Maclise' Burlington Magazine 1968, pp685-93; R L Ormond Daniel Maclise Arts Council National Portrait Gallery exhibition catalogue 1972 \n\nThe Honourable Mrs Thomas (after Gainsborough) \nF22A \nMillboard, 32.4 X 22.3 cm (12 \u00be X 8 \u00be ins) \nBequeathed by Mrs John Forster 1894 \n\nA copy of Thomas Gainsborough's picture (exhibited at the RA in 1777, now NGS; see E K Waterhouse Gainsborough 1958, no 323 pl 173). \nGainsborough's painting remained in the Graham family collection until 1859; it was lent by Robert Graham to the exhibition of old masters at the BI in 1848 (138), and it was possibly on this occasion that Maclise made the copy, presumably for John Forster. Forster also owned Gainsborough's portrait of his two daughters, included in his bequest to the museum (F9). Ormond comments that 'Although Gainsborough did not exert a very direct influence on him Maclise was clearly attracted by his painterly style. The vivid brushwork of the copy has parallels in the treatment of several Maclise subject pictures, the Woodranger [about 1838, RA collection] for instance'. Maclise also copied Gainsborough's portrait of Jonathan Buttall, the 'Blue Boy'; it was lot 248 in the artist's studio sale in 1870. \n\nEXH: Daniel Maclise  Arts Council, National Portrait Gallery, 1972 (27)\nLIT: \tOrmond 1972, p34\n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
