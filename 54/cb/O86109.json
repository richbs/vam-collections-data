Here Hiroshige depicts the legendary sculptor Hidari Jingoro. He is asleep in his workshop with his woodcarvings coming to life around him. Behind him a doll has come out of its box to assume the form of a young girl. Above him a dragon is breaking loose from a carved panel propped up against the wall to the left. Even the carving block on which he is leaning is starting to turn into a lion-dog. The text states that Hidari Jingoro was a native of Fushimi in Yamashiro Province (modern Kyoto Prefecture). It claims that he is so well known that no more needs to be said about him. It then explains that his son and grandson, both of whom were also highly skilled carvers, were called Soshin and Hidari Masakatsu.",
