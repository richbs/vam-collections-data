He showed views of Loch Coruisk on several occasions, but it is most likely that this painting dates from 1826.  The critics much admired his epic scale, and agreed that his treatment of mountain and loch scenery was unsurpassed.  One writer, in Ackermann's Repository of the Fine Arts, thought this picture perfectly illustrated Sir Walter Scott's lines in Lord of the Isles: \n            'Of desert dignity to that dread shore, \n            That sees grim Coolin rise and hears Corisken roar'.  \nCertainly this watercolour has a dramatic scale, the highland chieftain, rhetorically gesturing to the distant peaks, appears very much the Scott hero, and Robson did quote from Scott in the exhibition catalogues on at least two occasions when he showed such scenes.  It might be that the foreground figures are actually characters from Lord of the Isles: Robert the Bruce,  Lord Ronald of the Isles and his page.",
