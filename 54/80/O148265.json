This drawing is a skillful and meticulous copy of the left-hand section of the original frieze-like composition. It is so close in spirit and technique to the original that it seems likely it is the work of an artist belonging to Mantegna's close inner circle, perhaps an assistant in the master's workshop.",

The copyist follows the original line by line, except in the hatching, where his lines are finer and closer together. Another similar drawing connected with the same engraving, less finely shaded, is at Chatsworth and is believed by some authorities to be Mantegna's design for the engraving (reproduced in E. Tietze-Conrat, <i>Mantegna</i>, 1955, pl. 99; q.v. for bibliography). Compare also the fine early copy after the two figures on the left of the engraving in the Mus\u00e9e Bonnat, Bayonne (Bean, <i>Bayonne Catalogue</i>, no. 64).",
