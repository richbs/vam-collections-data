Another sketch of the gown is E.22208-1957. The gown is very elaborate, with a enormous crinoline skirt with ruffles and a long train. As the dolls were made to one-third scale, it was possible to create such extravagant designs using a fraction of the fabric that a full size version would require, which saved fabric and resources at a time of austerity and shortages.\n\nDuring the Second World War, from 1940 to 1944, France was occupied by enemy German forces. Paris was liberated in August 1944. Soon afterwards, the haute couture fashion industry in Paris, which had been heavily suppressed by the Nazis, put together the first Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Mode. This was a travelling exhibition of wire mannequins with plaster heads which were dressed in fully accessorised outfits by Paris fashion designers, milliners, shoe-, bag- and glove-makers to perfect one-third scale. The dolls were placed within elaborate stage sets and toured around Europe and North America in order to demonstrate that the Paris fashion industry had survived Nazi occupation. These designs are for the first run of the show, which opened in Paris in March 1945, and toured London, Leeds, Barcelona, Stockholm, Copenhagen and Vienna. After this, the dolls were completely re-outfitted for 1946, and sent to the United States, where they were displayed in New York and San Francisco. In 1952, the Maryhill Museum in Washington D.C. acquired the mannequins, which had been left in San Francisco after the final show, with only the jewellery returned to Paris. The Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Mode dolls can still be seen at the Maryhill Museum.",
