Craftsmen exploited the motifs for their intrinsic decorative qualities, although it was the information that they conveyed about the status and wealth of the owner that was most important.  This panel would have originally formed part of a richly painted and gilded scheme of carved wall decoration. Four heraldic panels survive.\n\nPlaces\nMaenan Hall, Caernarfonshire, was a late 15th-century timber-framed hall belonging to Conwy Abbey.  Sir David Kyffin, a wealthy cleric, took possession of the house after the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the later 1530s and made it his family seat.  He undertook some alterations before his son Maurice Kyffin transformed the house in 1582. It was probably Maurice who commissioned the heraldic panels,  to display his status and allegiance to the Queen, Elizabeth I (ruled 1588-1603).\n\nDesign & Designing\nDuring the reign of Henry VIII (1509-1547) legislation was passed relating to the use of armorial devices.  In order to ensure that they used the correct forms, carvers and painters are known to have owned and consulted pattern-books.  Unfortunately, no such patterns survive.  However, there are surviving royal records of arms and heraldic beasts, for example, those by Sir Thomas Wriothesley (died 1534), Henry VIII's Garter King of Arms.  These records would have been used to give advice to painters involved in the decoration of the royal palaces.",
