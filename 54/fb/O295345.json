It was described as 18th century when it was acquired by the Museum in 1891.\n\n Antique Dutch silver of all kinds was immensely popular in Britain at the end of the 19th century, particularly buttons.  To meet the demand, many Dutch silversmiths made casts of antique examples, often including their original marks, stamped them using old moulds, or made new buttons in archaic designs.  Although this button looks old, the design, of two courtly lovers, would have been rather unusual in the 18th century, when the designs were mainly religious or rural, but was very common around 1900.  The shape of the shank is also more characteristic of 1900 than 1800.  It has no silver marks to help identification.  The makers of buttons like these, intended for export to Britain, often did not bother to have them assayed in the Netherlands first.",
