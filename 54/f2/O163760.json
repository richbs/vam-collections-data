            "public_access_description": "Gloves were essential accessories in 17th century Britain; only the most destitute would go outdoors with their hands uncovered.  In addition to providing protection and warmth, the purpose of many gloves was solely decorative, to display the wealth and status of their owner. They were worn in the hat or belt, as well as carried in the hand. In combat, a glove was thrown down as a gage, or challenge.\n\nOrnately embroidered gloves served official purposes, signifying the holding of a civic office or membership in the local freemanry. Gloves were popular as gifts, particularly as a New Year\u2019s gift to the monarch and they were frequently given as a sign of royal favour.    Recent studies of the marriage ceremony in late Tudor and early Jacobean England show that accessories, particularly gloves were frequently exchanged between men and women.  This may explain why so many survive in museum collections.",
