The decoration of the gown and petticoat - round the neck and down the front and skirt, and round the hem of the petticoat - is made of ruched bands of the same silk. Ground weft purple; warp pink.  Brocading wefts: white, red, peach, two shades of blue, and three shades of green in silk floss, and white cordonnet (a tightly twisted silk thread). Internal lining and bodice are in sturdy, closely woven linen.\n\n\n[gown] The silk is draped and sewn to a linen bodice, which is boned (whalebone) at centre front, centre back and side seams. Seven eyelet holes on each side at front and eight on each side at back for laces (dark brown laces may be later additions). Ruched lengths of the same fabric act as robings (the decorative bands that run from neck to hem) and additional decoration at the side of the skirt (possibly adjusted later). The back comprises two widths of silk, pleated into a double box pleat centre back and attached to bodice. Stitched down 7.5 cm from neck band. Elbow-length sleeves are also sewn to a linen base, and end in a double flounce with a scalloped edge. Linen protective band round inside of lower hem, runs almost to front edges, the quality of the stitching and the finish towards the front suggesting later alterations. Several colours of thread have been used in the construction of the gown, the uneven quality of the stitching suggesting alterations. Slits to allow access to pockets in side seam from waist down, about 15.5cm in length.",

The cut of the gown altered gradually over time, whereas silk patterns changed seasonally, revealing how up-to-date the wearer was.\n\nWell-to-do women had their gowns made to measure by dressmakers, who were economical in their use of the silk, mounting it on a bodice of linen, and stitching it down in a way that allowed for alterations at a later date. A French treatise of 1772 gave instructions on the making of such gowns, recommending eight stitches to an inch (about 2.5 cm).",

In a letter dated 20 August 1913, the Museum's Director Sir Cecil Harcourt Smith, on behalf of the Board of Education, wrote to the Secretary of Harrods to acknowledge gratefully the offer of the collection and a collection of shoes then in the Museum at Leicester. 'Thanks to the public spirited action of your Board, it will henceforward be possible in this Museum to illustrate to an almost adequate degree the history of English costume from the Elizabethan period down to the second half of the 19th century.' Cecil Smith's final paragraph noted the significance of the silks in the gift: 'I may add that many of the costumes now offered are made of brocades which may be classed among the most elaborate and costly work of English and French looms in the 18th century: the collection will thus provide an important and valuable addition to the material for technological study in the Department of Textiles' ( RP/1913/4054M. The gown was one of about 150 costumes of men and women... covering a period from the time of James I. down to the late Victorian age, almost all being English in origin (RP/1913/4023M).",
