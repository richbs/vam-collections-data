The design was executed for a production of Matthew Bourne's dance work \"Highland Fling, a wee Romantic Ballet\" performed by Adventures in Motion Pictures at the Bristol Arnolfini, April 26th 1994.  The production, a witty re-working of Auguste Bournonville's great Romantic ballet \"La Sylphide\" with music by Herman Lovenskjold, was later presented at the Lillian Baylis Theatre, London, May 10th 1994, and then toured the country extensively.  The production was lit by Tina MacHugh, and the original cast included Maxine Fone as The Sylph, Scott Ambler as James, Etta Murfitt as Madge, Emily Piercey as Effie, and Simon Murphy as Gurn.  The production was also performed at the Bloomsbury Theatre in November 1994, and at the Donmar Warehouse in March 1995.",
