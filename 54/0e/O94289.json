They bought the rights to the game from Charles Darrow, who claimed to have invented it. He, however, based it on earlier versions of a land-owning game that had been around since about 1900. In particular, Monopoly is very similar to The Landlord's Game, which was patented in 1904 by Lizzie Magie. This, like other similar games, was very popular among the Quaker community in the USA. The Quakers supported a single tax system - a tax on land ownership. The street names in the original Monopoly came from Atlantic City. This was where Charles Darrow went on holiday.",
