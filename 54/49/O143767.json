They usually wore them on a black velvet ribbon, fastened tightly round the neck like a choker, with a slide at the front.  The ribbon passes through the bale of the cross, and is then threaded through a hole or loop at the base of the slide, and out at either side.  The ribbon is tied in a bow at the back of the neck.\n\nNormandy has the greatest variety of crosses, some so elaborate as to be almost unrecognisable.  This cross is much plainer than the extreme forms more typical of Normandy.  But it was acquired as a traditional design worn by the peasants of Picardy, and is set with rock crystals in high conical mounts, as are many other Normandy crosses.  It is also very similar to a cross with late 18th century marks in the Historical Museum at Rouen.  So it may represent an early design, which died out at the beginning of the 19th century, yielding place to more flamboyant patterns.",
