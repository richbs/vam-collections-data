There is now a dark coating over the whole surface which in some areas almost completely obscures the original decoration. This coating was probably applied and a later date possibly to cover any repairs and unify the finish. Where this coating is damaged the gold leaf appears very bright below.\nThe back is painted with a dark coating.\n\nThe oval panel at the bottom differs in style of painting from the rest of the frame and appears to be a replacement, probably for a marble plaque. It is delicately executed. Trace of bole found on the wings of the butterfly, seen below the dark coating, indicate that this area was once coloured.  There are also areas of raised decoration (possibly gesso), giving a subtle depth to wings. \n\nCondition:\nWood worm damage severe in places leaving just thin layer of surface decoration in places\n\nHanging device: old metal hook.\n\nInvestigation carried out by Christine Powell and Zoe Allen, 2009.",

(Chicago, 1971), fig. 14, pp.6-7. Huth notes that this type of frame is often associated with portraits of the school of Corneille de Lyon, dated c1580, thus offering an approx. date for the frames which are 'lacquered in black and decorated with ornaments in gold, enhanced with colorful marble slabs cut into roundels and squares and arranged very much like those seen on the facades of Venetian palaces of the early sixteenth century. Similar frames noted at the Louvre, Art Institute of Chicago, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston 'and elsewhere'. Notes that frames using the same architectural decoration though without the marble inlay were used for embossed wax portraits executed in Venice by Francesco da Segala towards the end of the 16th century, and for eglomise paintings popular in Venice throughout the 16th century. Suggests that the decoration (in classical and Moresque character) 'was intended to produce an effect akin to the kind of lacquer known in Venice from Turkish bookbindings, weapons, boxes, and other trinkets', and that similarly decorated Venetian objects such as caskets, 'make it most convincing that frames of this kind originated in Venice', and that the association with French paintings does not prove that the frames are French. A similar frame used before 1538 by Albrecht Altdorfer for a coloured woodcut, was Venetian in inspiration. Notes several cabinets (c1550-70?) decorated with embossed leather which feature on their facades several frames of this type with marble inlays, and which were imitated (more coarsely) in France.\n\nNewbury.T., Basacca.G ., Kanter.L.

Recent studies of the techniques used found that Venetian 'lacquer' was generally made up of linseed oil and colophony derived from pine resin, a composition also mentioned in contemporary writings such as Leonardo Fioravanti (1517-1588) in his 'Compendio  di secreti rationali' (Venice 1562). Turpentine of larch, also known as 'Venice turpentine' was also used, though not sandarac, the most important resin in Islamic lacquerwork but problematic on account of its limited availability and complex preparation. Arabesques were applied in powdered gold on the black-painted wood, and gold leaf employed for gilding larger decorative surfaces which were then given a luminous glow through a lustre finish in a variety of colours. Tempera was probably used as well as oils, and a final coat of glossy varnish applied. These studies suggest that the stylistic imitation of Islamic models was coupled with the use of largely identical techniques (p.24, citing Adriana Rizzo, 'Le \"laque\" v\u00e9nitien: Une approche scientifique', in Venise et l'Orient 828-1797, exh. cat., Institut du monde arabe, Paris (2006), pp. 244-51)",
