Satin and velved warp order 3-1-2.  Velvet structure, red and green.  Pile counts, warps 12; along weft 13.  Binding weft threads: fabric backed.\nBrocade structure: wholly brocaded? whole  4/1 twill, count 20.  Shots between pile 2.  Metal &amp; twist: silver &amp; gilt.  Z tightness of wrap: Super.  Alternate as follows: gold main field; plain silk spandrels; gold border; silver lappets.  Metal totally blackened; two colours of soilk: ivory and bronze; metal thinner in diameter than some.  Selvedges: dimensions cut.\n\nGeneral notes: It seems possible that this textile has a hiccup or flaw in the main field or similar.  Note particularly that the blossom in the centre of the main border at the upper end and compare it to others of the type; it is scrunched, the middle portion is missing.  However, the lappets are fine - no squashing or missing bits.  It is possible the thread model was too large for the loom.\nThe man who tied the two separate patterns - lappets and main field - to the loom first did the lappets.  As he began tying the second thread model to the lashes/cords that connect it to the pile warps (ie. attaching the pattern harness to the loom), he realised that there were too many warps in the pattern and not enough on the loom.  This comes from a practice of combining and recombining patterns.  Note esp. here that the borders were of the same proportion as the main field, as they are clumsily reduced too.",
