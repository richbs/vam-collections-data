Bangert, using a computer and a line plotter - a drawing device that is controlled by a computer program. \n\nColette Bangert trained as an artist, and Charles (Jeff) Bangert worked in the Computer Center at the University of Kansas. They first started to use a line plotter in 1967, when Jeff was asked to test one. The Bangerts went on to make collaborative \"algorithmic drawings\", produced by entering a set of instructions into a computer program that controls the drawing machine. Their works are signed CB, for Colette-Charles Bangert.\n\nColette Bangert has stated that \"The subject of all my work has been landscape. The elements of the computer work and my hand work are often repetitive, like leaves, trees, grass and other natural landscape elements are... The form of grass as grass, leaves as leaves, is what I'm exploring... Grass as form. Grass is also random and random is a natural computer facility.
