            "public_access_description": "The 'Viking' range of furniture was meant for use in a domestic setting. The designs for hi-tech tubular metal furniture, painted in bright 1970s colours, represented a complete departure from the traditional cosiness of British furnishings. The industrial look of the seating and tables (not shown here) fitted into the new mid-1970s fashion for converting industrial premises and warehouses into living spaces, where the old boundaries between domestic and workspace were being blurred. \n\nThis range was designed by G.P. Wood for Conran Associates, set up by Terence Conran. They designed and produced simple, cheap, well-made furniture for the modern, practical home. Conran also founded the Habitat chain, opening the first shop on the Fulham Road in 1964. Like much of Conran's furniture, this range was designed for both domestic and business use.",
