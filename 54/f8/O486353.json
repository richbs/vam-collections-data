The Chinese woman who wore this skirt probably had bound feet and would have swayed from side to side accentuating the swing.  It is likely that Chinese women wore these skirts around their hips rather than right on the waist; the pleats fall more gracefully if the skirt is not pulled in at waist-level.  The pleats are held down at the top in a V-shape with simple running stitches.  This gives some elasticity to the pleats and ensures that they swing well.  There are twelve pleats in each pleated section.  Six are folded over one way and six the other so that each group faces into the centre.  Every individual pleat is defined with narrow bias-cut black satin which is left plain near the top part of the garment, and is covered with embroidery, in shades of blue, on the lower third.  A tiny, flat gold-woven edge further enhances each pleat.  It is only the lower part that will show beneath the three-quarter-length gown that was traditionally teamed up with this style of skirt.",
