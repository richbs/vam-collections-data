It's finely executed incised decoration would suggest a high original purchase price. The horse's head in the centre may be the device of a noble family.\n\nA variety of incising tools were used to create the decoration through the slip. Fine and blunt styluses were used to create the cabling on the border. Curved and straight carving tools were used to create the floral and arabesque patterns. You can see the incised lines quite clearly on the body of this dish where the white slip has come away. This has revealed the red body underneath with the incising lines.\n\nOn the back of this dish there are the letters 'P.G.'. When this dish was acquired in the mid 19th century it was thought that these letters stood for its place of manufacture - Perugia in Umbria. More recently, archaeologists have uncovered fragments with very similar decoration in the Tuscany region. Another dish, in the Museo Nazionale in Florence, has the same interlaced arabesque pattern in the centre as in this dish. It is likely that both dishes were made in a Tuscan workshop.",

He wonders if the horse's head is a reference to a crest with that device of the Trinci family who were lords of Foligno but died out in 1452. He makes reference to the dish in Cora 285c and remarks on the similarity of the surrounding interlaced framework.",
