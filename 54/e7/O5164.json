Perhaps because so little German wine was consumed in England, the special type of glass was always associated with it. \n\nCollecting\nBecause of their infrequent use, several early lead-glass Roemers have survived. Very similar examples with seals of either a raven's head or a letter 'S' are now both considered Ravenscroft products. Documentary evidence shows that this maker used seals in 1676-7, but more precise dating poses a puzzle for glass historians. We know that in 1676  the Roemers could have been made at either of his two glasshouses: at Henley-on-Thames in Oxfordshire, or at the Savoy glasshouse in London. By 1677 the former was closed, however, so they could only have been made in London.\n\nTrade\nBefore George Ravenscroft began producing these in the mid-1670s, the small but steady demand for German-type Roemers led to at least one London glass dealer ordering crystal glass versions from a Venetian glasshouse. Even though the clarity of crystal glass was much admired, it is rather surprising that the cheaper German Roemers were not imported. By the end of the 18th century, however, it became customary for English 'Old Hock'  glasses (named after a German wine) to be made of green glass like the originals.",
