Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn\u2019t needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\n\u2018Monsewer\u2019 Eddie Gray was apprenticed to a troupe of jugglers when he was nine, and was a founder-member of the Crazy Gang - the one with a thick Cockney accent  who attempted sartorial elegance in badly fitting evening dress.",
