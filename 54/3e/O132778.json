Having studied paintings in various institutions, including the National Gallery in London, le Brocquy went on to produce a challenging body of work with manifest sensitivity to the turbulent political climate in post-war Britain. Le Brocquy's textile designs were similarly progressive. The severe forms and stark contrast in colours employed in his designs are visually unsettling and recall le Brocquy's most famous work, a depiction of domestic isolation entitled  A Family, which was painted in 1951 and is now in the National Gallery of Ireland.\n\nLe Brocquy executed this design for David Whitehead Ltd., a leading manufacturer of furnishing fabrics, based in Lancashire. The company engaged avant-garde designers to produce furnishings with a modern 'look', throughout the 1950s and 1960s. The design on this fabric was created by mechanised screen-printing, then a comparatively new technology that reduced costs considerably for the manufacturer.",
