They were made either from hollowed-out ivory tusks or two pieces of wood joined together and covered with leather, like this example. This instrument made great demands on the player, and as Roger North (1653 - 1734), a keen amateur musician, observed ' ... the labour on the lips is too great and it is seldom well sounded'. This might help explain its decline to obscurity by about 1700.",
