Charles Didelot and Mlle Theodore are the dancers, and their generation is the first which no longer wears the bulky restrictive costumes of past years. Their freedom of movement is evident when compared with a ballet of 30 years before.\n\nDauberval was a dancer who then took over the running of the Pantheon theatre and also the choreography of its ballets. Dauberval had been a pupil of Jean Georges Noverre who believed that dancers should express their feelings through movement, gesture and facial expression. Dauberval wrote 'I do not want just to please the eyes, I must interest the heart'. One of the ballets for which he is best known is the first ever version of La Fille Mal Gard\u00e9e,although his original choreography has not survived.",
