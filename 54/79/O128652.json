            "public_access_description": "Great Britain\u2019s leading theatre designer from the early 1930s to the mid 1950s, Oliver Messel (1904-1978) won international acclaim for his lavish, painterly and poetic designs informed by period styles.  His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nGr\u00e9try\u2019s Z\u00e9mire et Azor (1771) is based La Chaus\u00e9e\u2019s comedy, Amour par amour (1742), a variant on Charles Perrault\u2019s fairy tale Beauty and the Beast (1697).  Messel\u2019s production was first performed at the Bath Festival at the Theatre Royal in 1955.   His colourful, elegant and fantastic costumes and sets complement the otherworldliness of the story.\n\nMessel\u2019s costume for Zander, the father of Z\u00e9mire, is a colourful Oriental style costume with a luxuriant feel. The cloth turban is embellished with colourful feathers which match his costume. The gold balls are made from paper and metallic thread to give the illusion of delicate metal filigree jewellery.",
