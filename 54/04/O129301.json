In a statement made in 1988 he averred that printmaking was a seminal activity for him, which significantly affected his development as an artist, particularly the way he continued to draw and he confessed to sometimes having a longing to make prints. \n\nIn the early 1970s Sandle made several screenprints where the hard-edged contrast between black ink and silvered ground made for a particularly harsh effect, well suited to his subject matter which often addressed brutality and violence.Much of his work has a memorial theme, looking back to various periods of intense international and global conflict. This image which might almost be a study for a sculpture suggests the architecture of the Nazi Third Reich, with stripped-down pillars and de-humanised scale.",
