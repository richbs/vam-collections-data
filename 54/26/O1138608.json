P. Kemble and Sarah Siddons, protesting against the members of the amateur acting group the Pic Nic Society who performed at London's Tottenham Street Concert Rooms. The playbill by the stage advertises the production Tom Thumb.\n\nProductions by the Pic Nic Society were unwelcome competition to professional actors and theatre managers, and considered decadent and extravagant by those who launched attacks against them in the press. Sheridan is shown here holding a quill pen, its feathers inscribed with the names Morning Chronicle, Morning Herald, Morning Post and Morning Courier - newspapers in which his diatribes against the Pic-Nics were published. Gillray based this cartoon on the incident in the novel by Miguel de Cervantes when Don Quixote attacks Master Peter's puppet show because he is convinced the action is real.",
