The name of the town in present-day Uttar Pradesh means 'waste land'. According to Sir George Watt in the official catalogue of the Delhi Exhibition of  1902-1903, Indian Art at Delhi, 1903, Khurja had originally produced pottery in a style all of its own, with decoration raised in slight relief by the use of slips in floral patterns picked out in white and blue, as here, often against a warm orange brown, or pale claret coloured field. Later a rich green-blue was introduced.  By the time of the Delhi Exhibition Watt laments that the distinctive style of Khurja had vanished and that their wares imitated those made at Multan with a 'dull and faded' blue, and were made in a number of 'quaint shapes'.",
