It was drawn by Gilbert Sommerlad (1904-1976), a rehearsal pianist and orchestral violinist at the Brighton Theatre Royal from 1932 until 1936, and at the Oxford New Theatre from 1936 for over forty years. Sommerlad sketched the stars on stage when he wasn't needed in the orchestra pit, compiling the sketches in a series of albums.\n\nBill Maynard was a comic before he trained as an actor in repertory theatre but he is best known today in the UK and America for his role of Claude Jeremiah Greengrass in the Yorkshire Television series Heartbeat.",
