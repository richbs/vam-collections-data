The majority of its tapestries are large-scale corporate and public commissions, but there has also been a demand from individual clients keen to own small examples of work.  In order to make its tapestries more widely available, the workshop put together a collection of specially designed small tapestries, to be woven in limited editions.\nStephen Benwell is one of Australia's most notable ceramicists.  He studied at the Victorian College of the Arts and received his Diploma of Art in 1974.  In 2005, Benwell was awarded his Masters of Fine Arts from the Monash University.  Primarily a ceramicist, Benwell uses the medium as a canvas, the lively marks, imagery and graceful use of colour are central to any piece he creates.  Figure demonstrates his lyrical painitng style, which often contains a narrative, and the quirky use of imagery in this tapestry is reminiscient of the undulating surfaces of his ceramics.",

Registered File number 1994/1388.\n\nHistorical significance: This series of miniature tapestries was created by the Victorian Tapestry Workshop as a way of widening access to and ownership of their work. A number of artists, such as Stephen Benwell, the ceramic artist, agreed to collaborate on the project. Several of them spent time at the Workshop as artists in residence. This project differed from the usual large scale long-term work of the Workshop and provided individual, short-term and intimate challenges for the weavers.",

The majority of the Workshop's tapestries are large-scale commissions, for display in venues such as arts complexes, schools and universities, corporate foyers and boardrooms. Between 1983 and 1988 the Workshop collaborated with Australian artist Arthur Boyd to produce a monumental tapestry for permanent display in the new Parliament House n Canberra.  There has always been a demand from individual clients eager to own small examples of work and, in order to make their tapestries more widely available, the Workshop put together a collection of specially designed small tapestries to be woven in limited editions.  Designs were commissioned from a number of Australian artists, several of whom spent time with the weavers as artists in residence.",
