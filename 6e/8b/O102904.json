The light emitting element of the blind is printed onto a silk surface in a complex foliage pattern.  When illuminated, the light 'grows' across the surface, gradually spreading through the pattern.  The blind is intended for domestic use, and will respond by sensor to changing light conditions.  As the light around it dims, the blind itself will get gradually brighter; therefore the blind would become illuminated at night but will fade completely in bright sunlight. Wingfield is interested in the problems associated with sufferers of seasonal affect disorder (SAD) and both 'Digital Dawn' and her other examples of light-based textiles such as 'Light Sleeper Bedding' respond to these issues by providing a constant and responsive source of light.",
