The albumen print is entitled 'bronze figure from metallic screen Hereford Cathedral by Skidmore Coventry' and 'G. G. Scott. Esq. R.A. Arch'.  This figure was electroformed and fixed onto the Hereford Cathedral screen which was designed by the architect Sir George Gilbert Scott (1811-1878) and made by Francis Skidmore (1817-1896), metalworker, at his Coventry firm, Skidmore's Art Manufactures, in 1862. \n\nThis albumen print is a record of the figure before attachment to the Hereford screen and comes from the archive of designs and photographs from Skidmore's firm in the V&A.  All the figures, including this one, on the Hereford screen were in fact made from electroformed copper, then a new and advanced technique which was cheaper than casting bronze. Electroforming was a way of making metal objects by using electricity in which a plaster model was immersed in a suitable liquid, and an electric current was passed through it, which resulted in a metal coating over the plaster.  The object being electroformed can be a permanent part of the end product, as in this figure, or can be temporary and removed later, leaving only the metal form, the 'electroform.'",
