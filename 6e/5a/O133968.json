            "bibliography": "Parkinson, R., Victoria and Albert Museum, <u>Catalogue of British Oil Paintings 1820-1860</u>, London: HMSO, 1990, p. 86\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\"ETTY, William, RA (1787-1849)\n\nBorn York 10 March 1787, the son of a baker. Apprenticed to a printer at Hull, moved to London 1805, entered the RA Schools 1807 and studied with Sir Thomas Lawrence. Early works were mainly portraits and nude studies; his first large figure composition was 'The Coral Finder' (1820). Exhibited 138 works at the RA between 1811 and 1850, and 77 at the BI 1811-47. Travelled abroad in 1815/6, 1822, and 1830, principally to Paris and Italy. Elected ARA 1824, RA 1828. A retrospective exhibition was held at the Society of Arts 1849. Died York 13 November 1849. His studio sale was at Christie's 6-10 and 13-14 May 1850. Most admired in his lifetime for his large mythological subjects, but now perhaps more appreciated for his less finished and smaller studies of the nude. \n\nLIT: A Gilchrist <i>Life of William Etty</i> 2 vols, 1855; W Gaunt and F G Roe <i>Etty and the Nude</i> Leigh-on-sea 1943; D Farr <i>William Etty</i> 1958\n\n<b>The Ring</b> \n997 -1886 Neg 58955 \nMillboard stuck on canvas, 58.1 x 47.6 cm (22 7/8 x 18\u00be ins) \nDixon Bequest 1886 \n\nFarr suggests that it is 'almost certainly a Hero and Leander subject', and that 'the figure enclosed within a ring in the sky above the sea may be an attempt at symbolizing the death of Leander'. He dates the work to about 1835, and also suggests it may have been 'The Signal' exhibited at the Society of Arts in 1849, which Gilchrist lists as 'The Signal; or, \"Hero and Leander\". (Nude reclining figure)' under the year 1844. Gilchrist's dating is probably based on the fact that the Society of Arts catalogue incorrectly states the picture was exhibited at the RA in 1844. Etty exhibited two related subjects: 'The Parting of Hero and Leander' (RA 1827, Farr no 77) and 'Hero, having thrown herself from the tower at the sight of Leander drowned, dies on his body' (RA 1829, <i>Farr</i> no 62). \nAlternatively, it is possible that the subject is connected with the fairy romance of the sea nymph and the fisherman, told by De la Motte Fouque in 1811 (English cheap edition 1842) and interpreted variously in the opera <i>Masaniello</i> by Auber (performed in London 1829-35), the ballet <i>Ondine</i> (London 1843-8), and in Turner's painting 'Undine ... ' (RA 1846, Tate Gallery). Etty was certainly interested in such legends; apart from Hero and Leander subjects, he also exhibited such works as 'The Shipwrecked Mariner' (RA 1831) and 'The Sirens andUlysses' (RA 1837). Although Etty's image does not precisely accord with the Undine story nor does it accord with the Hero and Leander myth. However, it is curious that there seems to be no contemporary mention of an Undine subject, which would have been both topical and popular, in Etty's <i>oeuvre</i>. \n\nPROV: ?The dealer Richard Coils in 1849 (see <i>Exh</i>: below); Joshua Dixon \n\nEXH: ?Society of Arts 1849 (CX, 'The Signal', lent by R Coils) \n\nLIT: <i>Farr</i> no 61 as '<i>Hero Awaiting Leander</i>', p145\"",
