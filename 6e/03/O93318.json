The surviving scene  contains a representation of the Buddha's First Bath.   The child stands frontally in the centre of the panel while two male figures pour water from two water jars over him in a scene of lustration.  Only the outline of  the Buddha child is preserved. A male figure (probably Brahma) on the boy's left, with a cockaded turban shown against a nimbus, is dressed in an <i>antariya </i>with an <i>uttariya</i> draped over his left shoulder and looped across his body down to his right knee. He wears a breast chain over his chest. Standing with his left hand on his hip and his left knee flexed, he looks towards the boy. The figure on the other side ( probably Indra) stands in apparent profile with his head looking over his shoulder to a worshipper behind him.  He too wears a cockaded turban, but without any nimbus behind his head.  He wears his <i>antariya</i> drawn up between his legs and tucked in at the side.  His <i>uttariya</i> is slung round his body and over his back and he has a shoulder chain. Remnants of another worshipper on the right hand side can still be discerned. The scene is set within a plain rectangular border with the remains of rounded pillars and capitals on either side,and a small fragment of the adjacent scene on the right hand side. A badly abraded foliated garland runs across the top of the panel.\n      There is a fixing pinhole between the heads of the two left hand figures. Traces of a beige-coloured mortar can be seen on the back of the relief.",
