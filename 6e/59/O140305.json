The photograph is thus a record of the work done and comes from an archive of designs and photographs from the firm.  Skidmore was a leading Victorian metalworker in the Gothic Revival style, which was an architectural movement the nineteenth-century practitioners of which sought to revive medieval forms.  In addition to church plate Skidmore produced light fittings and furniture but was best known for his innovative architectural ironwork.\n\nAll the vessels shown in this photograph were used in the Christian liturgy or service. The ewer holds the eucharistic wine and the communion cup is an ecclesiastical drinking vessel for the wine. Patens were shallow plates on which the large Host rests at times before and after consecration.",

However, the ewer with grapes at top and bottom of the handle seems to be a variation on a design that Skidmore used frequently as this motif can be seen in the chromolithograph of Skidmore's church plate shown in the Great Exhibituion of 1851 and on a flagon from All Saints, Bisley, Gloucestershire. The paten is very similar to one from Whitnash parish church, Warwickshire. Skidmore produced a lot of silver church plate in the 1840s and early 1850s and he continued making some even when he branched out into architectural metalwork so this set could have been made anytime between 1845 and about 1870.'\n\nAnnette Wickham RF 2001/1166.",
