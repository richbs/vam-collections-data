But Garrick, who did not have a coat of arms, has instead used ribbons and beads surrounded by a triumphal laurel wreath, doubtless alluding to his own \u2018triumph\u2019 in the theatre.\n\nThe chairs were almost certainly made by Thomas Chippendale, whom Garrick commissioned to furnish his Hampton villa in the 1760s and 1770s, and whose reputation, like Garrick\u2019s, has long outlived him.",
