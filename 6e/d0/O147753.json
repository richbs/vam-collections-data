He was Head of Art Teacher Training at Hornsey College of Art,  one of the leading art schools in Britain in the 1960s. In the early 1970s Hornsey became part of Middlesex Polytechnic which then became Middlesex University, where Green became Dean of Art and Design (Emeritus Professor).\n\nBox Hill Quarry in Wiltshire was originally a source of Bath Stone for local building, but in the 1930s the Ministry of Defence converted it into a hidden underground storage area for ammunition, later used in the Second World War.\n\nThis print was submitted for the William Giles Bequest competion, an annual event throughout the 1950s, to encourage the development of colour printing. The competition was administered by the Victoria & Albert Museum which acquired many of the winning entries.",
