The merchants resided in the Steelyard,  which adjoined Dowgate. It  was the place where the King's steelyard or beam was set up, for weighing goods imported into London.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThere is another portrait of the same man by Holbein in the Royal Collection. Some believe that the subject is the goldsmith Hans von Antwerpen (or Hans or John of Antwerp, as he was variously known in England). The rich costume suggests, however, that the sitter was a wealthy merchant, a member of the Hanse or league of German merchants. The Steelyard, or German House,  was surrounded by a wall, which contained the merchants' warehouses, weigh house, church, offices and dwellings, which they had occupied since 1320. These merchants, originally from Cologne, were free from all London tolls and were permitted to trade at fairs throughout England. English merchants, jealous of their success,  tried for many years to persuade the Monarch to revoke the privileges of these 'Strangers'. They were successful only in 1597,  in the reign of Elizabeth I (1558-1603). The Steelyard was closed in 1598.",

London: Tate Publishing, 2006, p. 116, cat.no 127\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"     Workshop of Hans Holbein the Younger \n127 <i>An Unidentified Man  c.</i>1535-40?\n \n       Oil on oak Diameter 13 cm \n       Inscribed: AETATIS SVAE 35 \n       Victoria and Albert Museum, London \n\nThe subject of this small painting has been identified as the goldsmith Hans of Antwerp (see no. 91) by comparison with the portrait of a similar bearded man in The Royal Collection, although the inscription (now partly illegible) and other details of that portrait suggest the subject is probably a Hanseatic merchant; it is conceivable he was both merchant and goldsmith. \n\nThe frontal format and deep-blue-green background resemble Holbein\u2019s portraits of the 1530s, especially those of Hanseatic merchants. The original turned frame has been cut off. Infrared reflectography shows a number of adjustments to the underdrawing beneath the painted surface: for example the right eye was drawn lower (Appendix, fig. iv, p. 155). The end of the nose is outlined in Holbein's characteristic manner. However, examination with the microscope reveals a flatter, more descriptive style of painting than Holbein's, suggesting the possibility that the artist was a workshop assistant from the Low Countries. \n\nProvenance: Princess Matilde; George Petit; George Salting; Salting Bequest 1910 \nLiterature: Rowlands 1985 (36b) \nReference: Millar 1963 (29)\"",
