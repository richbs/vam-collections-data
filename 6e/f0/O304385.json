The capital is round at its base but pieced out near the top to form a concave-sided square with squared off corners.  \n\nThe capital is made up of eight pine stiles probably joined to each other with mortices and tenons.  On their outer face near the top they are pieced out  with eight further blocks, two at each corner, which form the projecting scrolling volutes at the four corners of the top of the capital.  Within the octagonal hollow of the capital we can see that the vertical joins are supported by two tiers of eight glue blocks. At the base of the capital is a stepped ovolo moulding which appears to be made from a single piece of wood, horizontally grained and hollowed out in the middle rather than joined from shorter pieces.  The bottom inner edge of this moulding is rebated, presumably to provide a secure housing for the top of the column on which the capital would originally have sat   The moulding is secured to the capital up through its rebate with eight equally spaced headless nails. \n\nThe surface of the main body of the capital is carved in relief with eight large acanthus leaves which rise upwards from the base.  The leaves alternately sit up straight on each side of the capital and scroll outwards at each corner so that at each corner the projecting scrolling volutes appear to rest on top of the curve of the scrolling leaf.  In between each of the eight acanthus leaves a thin stem rises up to form on the one hand, a foliate curved arch above the straight acanthus leaves, and on the other hand a foliate border part of the way round the edge of the scrolling volutes.  The front faces of the scrolling volutes are carved with husks and at either side in the middle there is a rosette.  The area immediately behind each volute (and above the projecting leaf which sits beneath it) is pierced.  All the surface areas of the volute have been sanded smooth but the tooling marks on the upper face of the scrolling leaf have not been smoothed and are clearly visible.  The ground of the main body of the capital, including the area immediately above the scrolling leaves, is quite even.  Tooling marks from carving out the wood are not visible as they are on the tops of the scrolling acanthus leaves.  However, the ground surface has been punched all over with rows of tiny holes.  Above the acanthus leaves and volutes is a fluted border with a stepped ovolo moulding above it.\n\nThere is evidence that the capital was once painted but is now stripped to the bare wood.",

            "public_access_description": "This capital was removed from a house which formed part one of the eighteenth-century terraces on Great George Street, London, prior to its demolition in 1910. No. 29, from which this capital comes, was built c.1780. It formed part of an alcove in the front room of the ground floor, a room considered by the museum to be the best and most complete surviving example of this period in the terrace. Originally painted, the paint has been remvoved to reveal the fine quality of the softwood carving. \n\nAs well as the capital, the museum also acquired from No. 29 the column on which it sat, a door frame, a section of a frieze, an architrave soffit, chair rails and skirting rails. Great George Street was redeveloped by H. M. Office of Works, with the building of the New Government Offices between 1899 and 1915 on the North side, and the demolition of much of the South side to create Parliament Square.",
