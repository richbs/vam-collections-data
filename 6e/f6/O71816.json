The fact that it is painted the colour of bronze may suggest it was intended for use as a specimen piece, to illustrate the form the shield was to take. Alternatively it may be a cast of a model - perhaps the clay model - the design of which was subsequently changed: although the scenes depicted on this piece mirror the design of the finished shield, they seem to have been assembled in a different order.\n\nThe silver gilt shield was executed by the firm of silversmiths Green, Ward & Green, who appointed Stothard to produce the design, which was cast by Benjamin Smith; it is now displayed at Apsley House, the Wellington Museum. The scenes depicted reflect landmarks in Wellington's career.\n\nStothard was one of the most accomplished of his generation, a painter and illustrator as well as a designer, and a contemporary and friend of the sculptor John Flaxman. Stothard studied at the Royal Academy Schools in 1777, and began work as a book-illustrator in 1779. He exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1778 and 1834.",
