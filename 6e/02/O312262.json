One reason for doubting the authenticity of the present piece is the way it has been made. The thinness of the ivory in the upper part of the relief is unusual in ivory carving of the early 17th century. The notably sour expression of the angels' faces is without any contemporary parallels. This and other curiosities suggest that they come from a different source than that of the figure of Christ. This figure is based on a woodcut by Albrecht D\u00fcrer (D\u00fcrers Verwandlung in der Skulptur zwischen Renaissance und Barock, exh. cat., Frankfurt am Main, 1982, p. 86). \nIn sum the relief is most likely to be of 19th century origin, made in the Netherlands or perhaps made in Brussels, although it is in the style of an earlier period.",

One reason for doubting the authenticity of the present piece is the way it has been made. The thinness of the ivory in the upper part of the relief is unusual in ivory carving of the early 17th century. The notably sour expression of the angels' faces is without any contemporary parallels. Their wings are carved in a schematic manner, despite their unusual form. The elongated bodies and their fragile, unmotivated stance on the plinth, along with the curious manner in which they are holding up the cloth all suggest that they come from a different source than that of the figure of Christ. This figure is based on a woodcut by Albrecht D\u00fcrer (<u>D\u00fcrers Verwandlung in der Skulptur zwischen Renaissance und Barock</u>, exh. cat., Frankfurt am Main, 1982, p. 86). In addition the perspective is ambiguous, and the placement of the instruments of the instruments of the passion, particularly that of the column is unusual at this early date. In sum the relief is most likely to be of 19th century origin, perhaps made in Brussels, although it is in the style of an earlier period.",
