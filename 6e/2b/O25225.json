The Metropolitan Railway in particular was involved in the building of out-of-town housing estates, and schemes such as the new Garden Suburbs.\n\nDrawn in a style influenced by the Arts and Crafts movement, this poster by Fred Taylor - a watercolour painter and poster artist who worked extensively for London Transport - wittily uses the image of a chessboard to illustrate the theme of re-location, and the range of housing available to the suburban commuter. Spilling off the edge of the board are cosy cottage bungalows, reminiscent, as are the other buildings, of the illustrations in a book of fairy tales.\n\n[Margartet Timmers, 'British Design at Home', p.104]",
