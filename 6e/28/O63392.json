It is important as we have few examples of shawls of this type in the collection. The heraldic motifs are particularly interesting and are probably a product of nineteenth century chivalry.  They are a similar colour and design to some of the motifs on the Eglinton Tournament waistcoat T.129-1969.",

The fact that the borders are sewn onto two opposite sides of the shawl means that when it is folded the four borders are arranged in a chevron down the wearer's back. British shawl borders were sewn on by hand until the 1840s when they were made on a handloom in one piece.  The colours are typical of fashionable shawls of the period and may have complemented the colours of the dress.",
