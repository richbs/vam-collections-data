The firm was founded in the USA in 1910 by Bernard E Fleischaker, a furniture dealer from Kentucky, and Hugo Baum, a puppet maker who had emigrated from Germany.  Their first products were various types of toys, and the 'Effanbee' mark was not used until they had decided to start making dolls in 1913.  The partners were innovative, and with the customary German doll supplies blocked by World War One, the firm soon expanded.  Effanbee is historically best known for its 'Patsy' girl dolls (said to be the first dolls to be promoted as having a wardrobe of clothes to collect), but the company made a number of lifesize baby dolls in the 1920s and 30s, including the apparently irresistible 'Baby Grumpy', and the first nappy wetting doll, Dy-Dee Baby.  'Sugar Baby' was a new design in 1930, and like most of her predecessors, was marketed as being safe and hygienic, with unbreakable limbs and a 'huggable' cloth body.",
