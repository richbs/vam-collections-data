If spelling is proved wrong, player loses 10 points.\nAs the fourteen dice supplied each have different letter combinations, a tremendous range of different words can obviously be compiled during the course of play.\nThe letter S can at any time be used to make plurals, but christian names and two letter words are not permitted.  While any of your opponents are studying the letters which turn up from their shake, do not reveal to them any words which you may notice as thiswill onlyhelp them to reach the winning score.\nScoring\nIt is suggested that a total score of 250 is the winning number, though this can be altered to whatsoever figure you like on prior arrangement.\nOne point is given for each letter used in words, ie three letter words three points, four letter words for points, five letter words five points, etc. and by using all 14 letters at one throw, in construction of words, the thrower counts an extra 50 points to his score, making 64 points in all.  The bonus word is GAME which also counts as an extra 50 points.\nSet a time limit of one or two minutes as desired, for each player to make his words during which time any change may be made.  The set of dice can be also used for doublescoring as an additional game two examples are given below.\nexample 1      D                     example 2           L     O\n                    A                                              I     N\n                TRY                                              MAKE\n                    S                                              P\nexample one scores 7 points and example two scores 11.
