            "history_note": "The brush was probably made in the town of Spa, Belgium, as souvenir ware.  Spa, famous from the 14th century for its healing  springs, attracted many aristocratic visitors from the early 17th century onwards, its name becoming synonymous for watering place.  Spa became noted for the production of decorative souvenir items such as bellows, hearth brushes, clothes brushes and boxes, decorated with inlay, known as '<i>les jolit\u00e9s de Spa</i>'. The physician Edmond Nessel wrote in a pamphlet in 1689 'It is a pleasure to see thousands of niceties [<i>milles jolit\u00e9s</i>] made in lacquer, done in the Indian style [<i>\u00e0 la fa\u00e7on des Indes</i>]. He mentioned work done in mother-of-pearl, ivory, tortoiseshell, English pewter, copper, and silver and referred to the Boulle technique and mother-of-pearl inlay combined with lacquer decoration. (Hans Huth, <u>Lacquer of the West</u><u>,</u> 1971).\n\nHuth suggests that the wood used for furniture was plane, alder or linden, which, after shaping, was soaked in water from the Pouhon spring at Spa, reputed to be rich in tannin, which gave the wood a brown colour and was said to prevent infestation with woodworm.\n\nIn the 17th  century most small items were inlaid with engraved mother-of-pearl, and silver, brass or tin, while in the 18th century, Spa became known for japanned wares imitating lacquer.  The combination of metal inlay combined with engraved mother of pearl is similar to the late 17th century technique of <i>boulle</i> marquetry using brass and tortoiseshell. The <i>Mus\u00e9e de la Ville d'eaux</i> at Spa has some comparative examples; a box inlaid with flower decoration around a plaque engraved with a church in a landscape, is similar to the decoration on the brush.\n\nThe Museum bought the brush in 1926 for \u00a35, from Mr H.J. Grimwade. V&amp;A curator, H. Clifford-Smith, commented that 'This is a rare example of clothes brush of Flemish [sic] workmanship of the late 17th century.  The back is beautifully inlaid with engraved mother-of-pearl and silver [sic] wire.  It is a type unrepresented in the museum, &amp; would make a useful addition'. \n\n(Spa depended on the Principality of Li\u00e8ge in the late 17th century and was not included in the Austrian Netherlands.  It is located in the Walloon Region of Belgium rather than Flanders so cannot be described as 'Flemish'.)\n\nPairs of bellows with comparable decoration in the V&amp;A collection are 226-1890 (with an image of Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane), 1400-1904  (with figure of Love and the Four Elements), W.11-1930 (with  figure of Plenty), and W.142-1921 (Berainesque decoration.)",
