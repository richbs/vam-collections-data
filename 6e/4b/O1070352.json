Mrs Foskett, otherwise repeating Long's entry, states that 'Long noted that the artist's name might possibly have been Gage, about whom I can find no information'. If he did, it was not in <i>British Miniaturists</i>, nor in the departmental files, where Long's notes read: 'There is no proof that the miniature is by Madame Garis, or Richard Gibson, or William Gibson, or Gerbier, or Richard Gaywood. Could it be by Sir John <i>Gawdy</i>, see Duleep Singh, Norfolk Portraits or by <i>D.Gibson</i>? or by <i>Grossing</i>, to whom \u00a35 was paid in 1679 for a picture in little of Wm. 5th E. of Bedford (Woburn Abbey A/cs)?' \n\nOf the known artists here, Gibson and Gerbier would now be regarded as out of the question on technical and stylistic grounds, as might members of Gibsori's family. Nothing is known by any of the others. An additional candidate would be Henry Gyles (1645-1709), glass designer and painter, owner of the Norgate recension of Hilliard's <i>Treatise</i>. (1) Again, however, though he was critically interested in limning, no works certainly by him, apart from glass designs, are known. Even the chalk drawing in the BM, (2) usually described as a self-portrait, is uncertain; in any case it is technically unrelated to the present miniature. \n\n1 <i>Miniatura</i>, BL Harleian MS 6376. \n2 Croft-Murray and Hulton 1960, vol.I, p. 343. \n\n<b>175 </b><b>Unknown Man</b>\n<b>c. 1655</b>\nP34-1928\n\n<b>Oval 60 x43 mm\n</b>\nFeatures mainly finely hatched in brown and sanguine, with some long lining strokes, touches of red under the nostrils and dark brown in the eyes, and with white highlights; on a pale creamy carnation ground; hair in brown wash, lined in darker colour, and with the lights in pale grey; cravat in grey wash, modelled in thick white and grey; the tie in very dark grey wash with the lights in pale grey; armour in dark grey wash with the lights in pale grey and with metallic gold for the studs; a plain brown background; on vellum put down on pasteboard. \n\n<b>Condition:</b> Faded; otherwise apparently sound. \n\n<b>Signed:</b> Centre left, in grey: <i>G</i>. \n\n<b>Frame:</b> Twentieth-century silver locket, the convex back set in straight sides of flat wire which hold the convex glass in a bezel; the hanger of square section, channelled down the middle, with a separate spiral of six turns in flat wire, beginning in small reverse turns in seventeenth-century style, on each side. \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> Said by Long (192 9) to have been 'a family portrait belonging to an old Scottish family'; purchased from Mrs A Shapcote of Stoke, Devonport, 1928: 'Mrs Shapcote appears to have inherited the miniature from a member of the same family as the Duke of Grafton.' (1) \n\n<b>Literature:</b> Long 1929, p. 164 Ca rather good miniature of about 1656-70'); Long 1930, p. 30; Foskett 1972, vol. I, p. 282; <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 23. \n\nThe miniature was bought by Long when he was writing the final entries for <i>British Miniaturists</i> (1929), in which it is the solitary exemplar of 'G'. No other works with this signature have since turned up, and no works have been attributed. The hand seems trained in the traditional limning techniques. The occasional long and wiry line in the drawing of the features appears in the work of other miniaturists of about this time, or perhaps slightly later, such as Flatman and Snelling. \n\n1 Apparently a Mrs Fitzroy; note by Long on the register sheet in the department file.\" \n\n",
