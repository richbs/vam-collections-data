The lions are more compact and the quadrepeds underneath the lions more stylized, for example the dog directly underneath the lions have in this fragments only three spots on their bodies instead of nine as in 763-1893.\n\nHistorical significance: These type of \"Zandaniji\" textiles are testimonies to the vibrant trade in silks of this period and how they were appreciated in both east and west.",

This textile is considered to belong to the Zandaniji group, the Sogdian textiles that have been linked to the village of Zandaniji, near Bukhara, by an inscription referring to such place present on one of them. Alike other textiles this one shows the debt to Sasanian-style design. See further: Dorothy G. Shepherd & W. B.
