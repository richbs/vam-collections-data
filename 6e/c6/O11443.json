Transfer-printing provided a cheap method of decorating this kind of royal souvenir, and has been used on this example.\n\nHistorical Associations\nFollowing the death of Prince Albert in 1861, Queen Victoria to some considerable extent shunned public life, never again living in London and occupying Buckingham Palace only for occasional visits lasting a few days. However, the 50th anniversary of her accession to the throne in 1887 was marked with great celebration, and the Queen was cheered by hundreds of thousands of her subjects as she travelled to a special service at Westminster Abbey. The public enthusiasm for the Jubilee resulted in the production of an enormous range of souvenirs, such as this plate. In subsequent years, the Queen was encouraged to make more frequent public appearances.",
