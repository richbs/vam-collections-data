            "physical_description": "1. marionette or string puppet of a flamingo. Created from 4 blocks of wood carved to shape the feet, body and head then painted reddish pink and highlighted with red and black. The parts are connected by lengths of thick red cord. From the top of the head and body connected by metal hooks are two lengths of thin red cord and a further two lengths are knotted to the thick cords representing the legs. All four cords are then knotted at the top to a polished wooden control cross bar which also has a matching loop of cord for hanging the puppet when not in use. \n2. original plain brown card box; printed on the lid in green the circle mark with the name around a figure operating a string puppet. Inside glued to the lid is a cream label printed in green showing the maker's\nmark, Registered No. 2396683 and directions for manipulating the puppet. \n\n*This toy was shown at the 1994 Toy Fair and is one of a range of puppets produced by the makers who are a co-operative of three ladies established in 1989. They make traditional wooden toys, however, the puppets have proved more popular and are their main business now. The company is a member of the British Toymakers Guild. The ladies are Anne Biggerstaff, Karen Bailes and Samantha North. Because of the simple stringing and large scale the puppets are easily controlled though designed for children over the age of three. This is a good\nexample of modern toymaking, using traditional methods and materials suitable for all children and family use.",
