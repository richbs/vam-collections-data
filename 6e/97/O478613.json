It represents a young woman, wearing a purple cotton dress with white spots, a red waistcoat or sleeveless jacket covered with a gold network, tightly belted with a yellow ribbon of satiny fabric (probably rayon or other synthetic material). Her head is covered with a long veil of the same shiny yellow fabric, tied at the nape of the neck in a vaguely Gipsy style, and edged around the front with a fringe of gold tinsel and some green and yellow embroidery to secure the tinsel. A long plait of black fibre tied with silver tinsel ribbon, emerges from under the veil and hangs down her front. She has a red spot on her forehead and a gold sequin representing a nose-ring. She wears a necklace of gold bands, magenta pink drop earrings, and two stars of silver tinsel fasten the bodice of her dress. Under her dress she wears red cotton trousers. On her back is a long narrow basket, wider at the top, and fringed there with green paper (perhaps representing a cover of leaves). The basket is kept in place by a red and yellow plaited cord, held in her bands. The doll is mounted on a wooden stand, which is labelled: 'Apple plucking lady with Kilta of Himachal Pradesh'",
