The wavy profile of the bowl and the twisted stem, suggest Renaissance Venetian glass, but the shape, as a form specifically for white wine, seems to be Philip Webb's own.\n\nDesign & Designing\nBy 1860, the architect Philip Webb had designed elaborately decorated glassware for William Morris's personal use at the Red House.  In 1862-1863, these were re-designed into a much simpler range for commercial production by James Powell & Sons Glass Works and were sold exclusively through Morris, Marshall Faulkner & Co.  Their simplicity probabaly appealed to very few and Powells were apparently unwilling to risk retailing the glass themselves.  However, by the early 1870s customers' tastes had changed and Powells were confident enough to commission Thomas Jackson to add substantially to the range.  Jackson's designs drew heavily on Webb's earlier ideas, especially on the wavy outline of this wine glass.\n\nPeople\nThis glass was bequeathed to the Museum by William Morris's daughter, May.  May Morris continued to live in the Morris family's country home, Kelmscott Manor in Oxfordshire, to the end of her life. The provenance therefore suggests the possibility that this glass, and others in the bequest, may have been chosen by William Morris or his wife Jane.",
