Each member of the band wore one as part of a co-ordinated outfit. The song was written about a party the band had attended at an art gallery in Glasgow, and the video reflects this situation. It hit number 4 in September 2005, and was declared the best single of the year by Q Magazine.\n\nMembers of Franz Ferdinand had played in various bands during the 1990s, including The Yummy Fur, but got together in 2002. They signed a record deal in 2003 with their first song released going to #43 in the charts. They built on this placing with their second single, Take Me Out which went to #3 in the UK charts, and their debut album also hit #3 in the UK and sold over a million copies in the USA. Their sound drew from early 1980s punk funk artists such as Gang of Four, combining this with inspiration from Roxy Music and Sparks, creating a wired, angular guitar pop sound. They've been nominated for several Grammy awards and their three studio albums have sold over 3.4 million copies worldwide.",
