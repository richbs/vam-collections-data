This coat is decoratively stitched to create interlined panels, which provide form and warmth. Paintings of historical dress are a potent source of inspiration. The style of this coat is derived from a man\u2019s fashionable day coat of the1730s, which featured a tightly fitting body and full skirt. The designer translates this historical silhouette to contemporary taste by rendering it in quilted taffeta trimmed with velvet. The detail and precision of the intricate quilting demonstrate the designer\u2019s skill and high level of craftsmanship.",
