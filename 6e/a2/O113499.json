Three further bowls (106, 107 and 109-1865), four silver spoons (110 to 113-1865) and a gold \u00e9cu of Philip VI of Valois (ruled 1328-50) from this hoard are also in the V&A. In 1961 Charles Oman suggested that they originally belonged to a larger hoard of silver, whose origin is unknown but was possibly near Gaillon in Normandy. This hoard also included pieces now found in the Mus\u00e9e de Cluny (traditionally thought to have been excavated in 1851 at the Ch\u00e2teau of Gaillon, once the country palace of the archbishops of Rouen), in the Basilewsky Collection now in the Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg and in the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris.\n\nHistorical significance: This is an extremely rare example of domestic table silver produced by Parisian goldsmiths at the beginning of the reign of Charles VI of France (ruled 1380-1422).",
