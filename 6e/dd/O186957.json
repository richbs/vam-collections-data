The cuirass is made of three pieces: a horizontal piece which goes across the back [just under the arm pit] and which folds across the front to overlap right over left.  There are 6 leather loops, each with a metal ring, attached down the left hand side [as worn] and the same along the edge of the right hand side through which a red silk cord has been interlaced.  The upper edge is curved to go below the arm and rises to a point in the centre back. Two separate panels have been added to run from the back over the shoulders to the front.  The inner edge of each, by the neck, is straight and the outer is curved outwards.  They are secured on the inside of the cuirass and fasten with a leather strap which corresponds to a buckle at the top of the front sections.  The outer face is covered with black silk which is over a layer of white woollen fibre padding.  The black silk is embroidered with dark red silk with a scale-like pattern, bands of chevrons and other bands embroidered with couched metal thread:\n[1] silver strip open Z-wound on yellow silk;\n[2] silver-gilt strip close Z-wound on yellow silk core worked over a padding of fibres.\nThere is a floral motif at the top on the back. A similar floral motif appears on each shoulder piece. The backing is red cotton and there are traces of a woven silk lining or facing [it's not evident how extensively this silk was used] with a red ground and a floral motif in green and yellow.  The edges were trimmed with narrow braids which have largely worn away.  There is a tablet-woven braid along the straight lower edge of the piece.",
