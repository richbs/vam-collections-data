They were manufactured by Pallas Textiles, a company based in the USA, for the large contract furnishing market, such as offices, as well as smaller environments.\n\n The 'Archaeology' collection was inspired by archaeological discoveries of the 19th and 20th centuries, incorporating patterns and woven structures that were 'suggested by the intricate designs of these treasures'.  'Sutton Hoo' is woven with a boucle yarn on a satin ground, giving it a raised, textured feel.  The design was inspired by the interlacing patterns of an Anglo Saxon gold belt buckle that was discovered in a ship burial dating from about 620 AD. \n\nLori Weitzner's work has extended beyond textiles. She has designed for a range of companies, with commissions including packaging for Estee Lauder cosmetics and interiors for Lufthansa Airlines.",
