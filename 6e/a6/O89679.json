Brown\u2019s drawings are similar in presentation to Ehret's botanical illustrations. In 1784 he became botanical painter to George, Prince of Wales.\n\nIn this image Brown's style is naive and rather laboured. He painted this passionflower on vellum, the preferred medium for professional botanical illustrators in the 18th century, making use of its smooth surface to paint very fine detail. It also helped to give a sheen to the painting of leaves and petals.",
