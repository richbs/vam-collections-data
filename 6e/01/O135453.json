Garrick played the role again at Drury Lane Theatre in 1792, and Hogarth chose to depict Garrick in this role in 1745, the year that Garrick took over the management of Drury Lane.  A year later Hogarth published this high-quality engraving of the painting, with the assistance of the distinguished engraver Charles Grignion (1721-1810). Both Garrick and his artists benefited from the publicity that the publishing of such an engraving invariably attracted.\n\nThe painting and engraving capture the power of Garrick's acting as he awakes from a nightmare-beleagured sleep in his tent on the battlefield at Bosworth (Act V, scene iii), and admits his terror about the ensuing battle. He grasps his sword in his left hand while he attempts to fend off the ghosts of his dreams with his right hand.  The inclusion of other props and symbols including the portrait of Christ and the suit of armour reveals Hogarth's desire for this to be seen as a serious history painting as much as a portrait of Garrick the actor.",
