Mr. Pyke had devoted most of his life to the study of waxes, and was the recognised authority in the field. His 'Biographical Dictionary of Wax Modellers', published in 1973, has become the standard reference book for students of the subject. Mr Pyke's own collection was wide-ranging, and included British, German, French and Italian portraits and figure subjects from the sixteenth century up to the present day. His generous bequest augmented and complemented the then existing holdings of waxes in the Museum.\n\nWax is a cheap material, easily worked, as well as light and easily transportable. It is quick and easy to shape, yet also cheap. Once softened, it is modelled in a similar way to clay, with the composition built up gradually. To enhance the wax, pigment can be added before moulding and pearls or other jewels can be embedded in the surface afterwards.\nIt is also intended as a kind of object of desire, covetable and collectible.  It is the ideal kind of object for a Kunstkammer in that it is small and light enough to be held in the hand and passed from person to person, and that it is attractive to the eye.  \n\nThe wax is cited by E.J. Pyke in his Dictionary [see references] as being a twentieth century version of a wax of Lord Nelson by A. C. Corona, made with the intention to deceive.",
