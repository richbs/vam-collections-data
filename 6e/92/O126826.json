Cat. no. 106, p. 184, illus.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows: \n \n\u2018106 \n<i>Street of Tombs, Pompeii</i>, 1838   \n \nWatercolour, gouache, graphite and  \nbrown ink on card, 28.9 x 41.9 cm  \n(11 3/8 x 16 \u00bd in)  \n \nInscribed in brown ink on the exedra:  \n<i>MAMIAE PUBLICAE: V.VS BLICAE [?]</i> \n  \nLit: V&A 1926, 126; Lister 305\n \nLondon, Victoria and Albert Museum,  \nP28-1919  \n \nIn May 1838 the Palmers travelled to  \nNaples. From their hotel \u2013 where  \nEdward Lear and Thomas Uwins were  \nalso staying \u2013 they sketched the bay that  \n\u2018filled up\u2019 their window, sparkling by  \nmoonlight \u2018like diamonds on ebony\u2019  \n(<i>Letters</i>, p.271). In July the Palmers  \nmoved to Pompeii, where both Hannah  \nand Samuel prepared five drawings of  \nthe city and the volcano that had simul- \ntaneously destroyed and preserved it in  \nAD 79. (<i>Letters</i>, pp.173, 190). At the end of  \ntheir month-long stay a minor  \neruption of Vesuvius reminded them  \nof Bulwer-Lytton\u2019s <i>The Last Days of  \nPompeii</i> (1834; <i>Letters</i>, p.143). As Hannah  \nrecounted it, \u2018fearful rumblings\u2019 and  \n\u2018dreadful noises like the discharge of  \ncannon\u2019 had followed a nocturnal  \nspectacle of \u2018vivid flame showering red  \nhot stones which at that distance seemed  \nlike a fountain of sparks, and spreading  \nout in fiery clouds\u2019 (<i>Letters</i>, p.192). \n \nMost of their Pompeiian sojourn,  \nhowever, was characterised by the  \n\u2018deathly quiet and silence\u2019 of the ruins,  \nwhere every structure carried morbidly  \nromantic associations (<i>Letters</i>, p.150).  \nThe Palmers particularly admired the  \nStreet of Tombs, and both made  \ndrawings of it (Hannah\u2019s: cat. 107).  \nSamuel\u2019s large watercolour presents a  \ncrossroads near the Porta Ercolano.  \nOn the left the paved, empty Street of  \nTombs appears lined with ruins and  \nbarred with shadows. On the right rustic  \nfigures and cattle traverse a track leading  \nto a grassy plain. At the intersection a  \nsingle cypress grows between the exedra  \nand colonnade of the tomb of the  \npriestess Mamia. In the distance, beyond  \nthe blue strip of Castellamare, Vesuvius  \nappears surrounded by clouds. The  \nview recalls Bulwer-Lytton\u2019s description  \nof the site: \n \nFrom the gate stretched the long street  \nof tombs, various in size and architec- \nture, by which, on that side, the city is  \nas yet approached. Above all, rode the  \ncloud-capped summit of the Dread  \nMountain, with the shadows, now  \ndark, now light, betraying the mossy  \ncaverns and ashy rocks, which testified  \nthe past conflagrations, and might  \nhave prophesied \u2013 but man is blind \u2013  \nthat which was to come! (Bulwer- \nLytton, p.135.) \n \nPalmer exhibited a work entitled  \n<i>Pompeii: The Street of Tombs</i> in 1840  \n(RA no. 1005), possibly the present work  \n(although Lister tentatively identified it  \nas his 304). Palmer later adapted the  \ncentral left portion of this design for the  \nvignette illustration on the title page of  \nDickens\u2019s <i>Pictures from Italy</i> (cat. 110).'\n<u>Vikutoria & Arub?to Bijutsukan-z? : eikoku romanshugi kaigaten = The Romantic tradition in British painting, 1800-1950 : masterpieces from the Victoria and Albert Museum / selected by Mark Evans</u> [Japan : Brain Trust], 2002. 185 p. : ill.
