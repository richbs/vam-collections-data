The design is not signed or dated but was probably created by Comelli in circa 1912. It shows a full length image of a woman dressed in a stylised black and white outfit trimmed with gold. The dress consists of a wide sleeved, high waisted tunic, finishing just above her knees in a small flared skirt. Both this tunic and the two underskirts she wears beneath, (one white, one black), fit tightly to her body and are fixed in tight accordian pleats. The over tunic has a gold belt decorated with white chevrons and red circles running under her bust and a wide collar with a gold trimmed, crenulated, edge. The sleeves are also intricately decorated with vertical white bands edged in gold interspersed with gold and black circles, over white puffed sleeves, the cuffs which are gathered at the wrist with a narrow black, gold tasselled, cord.",
