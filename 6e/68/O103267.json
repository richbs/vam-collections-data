They would probably originally have been part of a large religious object such as a custodia. Custodias were particularly important in Spain at this period. They were often very large and designed not only to display communion wafers but to be paraded through the town during important processions such as the Corpus Christi celebrations. These plaques are thought to have been made by a goldsmith associated with Enrique de Arfe. De Arfe was one of the most successful Renaissance silversmiths in Spain. He trained in Cologne in Germany but spent much of his career on commissions for Spanish cathedrals. \n\nThis plaque shows the presentation at the temple. At age twelve, Christ accompanied Mary and Joseph to Jerusalem but failed to return home with them. His frantic parents searched high and low. \"And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors [the temple elders], both hearing them and asking questions.\" Mature beyond his years, Jesus had gone to the temple, where he began to discuss fine points of biblical scholarship with the learned men who \"were astonished at his understanding and answers.\"",

This iconography would have been clearly understood in the past but it may be less familiar to modern eyes. \n\nThough often decorative, the symbols used on religious metalwork also refer to the function and significance of the objects. The contemplation of religious motifs can draw   believers into a deeper understanding of their faith. Complex theological themes can be represented in a visual form. A chalice, for example, might be adorned with the tools used in the Crucifixion (the 'Instruments of the Passion') to direct the viewer's mind towards Christ's sacrifice and his death on the cross.\n\nThe use of images has caused controversy throughout Christian history. While supporters held that imagery glorified God and helped believers understand their faith better, critics attacked its use as superstition and idolatry.\n\nSaints\nChristians venerate saints as men and women who, through the holiness of their lives, became especially close to God. The saints include martyrs who suffered and died for their faith as well as great teachers and preachers. Their lives provide an example and inspiration for the faithful. Roman Catholics also believe that saints can intercede on their behalf with God. In Christian iconography, saints are usually depicted with a distinctive object or 'attribute' associated with their martyrdom or works. For example, St Bartholomew, who was skinned alive, holds a flaying knife, and St George is shown with a dragon.",
