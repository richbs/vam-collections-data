            "public_access_description": "This wooden sculpture represents a Luohan, the name for a monk who acts as a guardian of Buddhism and is believed to have attained enlightenment through merit and virtue. The Luohan was a member of the Buddhist pantheon in China, and the earliest representations can be traced to the 4th century AD. These figures were usually placed in groups near the Buddha in temples and monasteries. Over time, depictions of Luohans evolved from individualized to more formalized portraits. The use of these images was further encouraged by the Chan (Zen) Buddhist sects, which stressed the importance of having a religious teacher and an interaction between master and pupil.\n\nThe style of this example suggests that the piece was made in north China where many workshops excelled in carved and painted wooden sculpture.\n\nThe appreciation for Chinese sculpture in Europe developed alongside an enthusiasm for earlier Chinese ceramics, and during the 1920s and 1930s the Museum acquired some outstanding examples, including this Luohan.",

ISBN 1851773088.\nAn appreciation for Chinese sculpture developed with the enthusiasm for earlier Chinese ceramics, and during the 1920s and 1930s the Museum acquired some impressive examples, including this luohan. Sets of luohan were placed in attendance of the Buddha in temples. Their number varied, but a common set comprised eighteen figures. This type of sculpture was encouraged by Buddhist Ch'an (Zen) sects, which stressed the importance of the religious teacher and of the interaction between master and pupil. This sculpture portrays a vigorous, middle-aged Chinese monk in the act of turning to his neighbour. From the style it is thought that the piece comes from one of the northern Chinese provinces that excelled in carved and painted wooden sculpture.\n\nLit.
