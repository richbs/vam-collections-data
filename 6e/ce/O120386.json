She required an extensive wardrobe for the many formal dinners and state functions that she had to attend.\n\nA couture client would attend all the fashion collections, seated in the front row if she were especially important like Lady Alexandra. After the show, she would place her orders with her vendeuse (personal saleswoman). \n\nLady Alexandra dressed exclusively at the house of Jacques Fath (1912-54), and commissioned this dress from Jacques Fath shortly before he died, for her second marriage to Hugh Trevor-Roper (later Baron Dacre). She told Cecil Beaton, \u2018the dress made for my wedding to Hugh was made up on the wrong side of the material (my idea because the colour of the right side did not suit me) and that dress was worn and worn\u2019.",

Love from Xandra.\n\n[Again, in a further letter...] I also have my Fath dress and jacket made for my wedding to Hugh in 1954 but I think it may not be effective enough for your exhibition.

Hugh went back to Oxford and I went to join the children in Scotland at Birchfield.  We just waited for the time to pass before we could be married.  I took a quick trip to Paris to get a dress, jacket and hat made by Jacques Fath to wear for my wedding.  It was beige and gold and the hat was velvet to match.  Madame Dufy [Lady Alexandra's vendeuse and sister of the painter Raoul] was very thrilled; I think that she sensed I had not been happy in the past.\nWe were married in the Presbyterian Church in Maylebone on October 4th, 1954.  The Longfords said it was (p.442 typed) alright for them to attend as Roman Catholics as my ex-husband had been married before so my marriage to him did not count!\nTatler, September 2007, p.142-3\nWritten by Richard Dennen, Lady Alexandra's grandson:\nWhen my grandfather did a runner (they had hit the slopes together in Switzerland, she twisted her ankle and he skied off to his next wife in the South of France), she sought solace in couture, donning a Fath number in beige and gold for her 1954 wedding to historian Hugh Trevor-Roper, later Lord Dacre.  Jacques Fath died a month later.  In the Sixties she turned to Lanvin and a life mainly back in Scotland.",
