Jacobsen also designed much of the furniture, cutlery, lighting and other fixtures and fittings, including these chairs. All these designs show the designer's mastery of double curvature that lend many of them a bulbous or organic form in contrast to the linearity of the hotel's architecture. The Egg chair was designed for the lobby and reception area, and the high back was conceived to give the sitter a degree of privacy in these public spaces. Grouped together, the chairs created their own space in a big room. The Egg chair became synonymous with mid-century Danish design and is still in production today.",
