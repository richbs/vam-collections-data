Some pattern chairs were made to commission for a client, so that he or she could then decide between the options proposed. This example, however, seems to have been made for display in the maker\u2019s showroom rather than as a prototype of a chair for practical use, for it is too large to be comfortable, especially in the length of the seat. The naturalistic rococo ornament on the back and arms is combined with much more architectural ornament, in the style of William Kent, on the legs. It is unlikely that any customer would have ordered a suite mixing up these motifs, but they demonstrate very well the range of details that the maker could offer.\n\nThe ornament resembles designs by the carver Matthias Lock, but we do not know who made this ambitious chair.",

The form of the chair, with a carved frame to the upholstered back, was newly fashionable in the 1750s, when such chairs were descrbed as 'French chairs', though appearing in English pattern books.
