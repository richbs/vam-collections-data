Italian goldsmiths were expert at making a little material go a very long way.  Many pieces seem too large to wear comfortably, but they are usually made of very thin gold, and are much lighter than they appear.  \n\nAll Italian women wore gold earrings.  Their shapes varied widely in different places.  This earring comes from Palermo, in Sicily, and is characteristic of a type worn throughout the island.  It has a mix of gold marks which show it was made in Sicily in the mid-19th century.  Goldsmiths in the south of Italy mainly used red gold, often mixed with yellow gold filigree.  \n\nIt was bought for \u00a33 12s.
