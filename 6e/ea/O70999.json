It used a rich glassy soft-paste body to make copies of contemporary Meissen figures. The Flemish modeller Joseph Willems produced a successful range of original models. They included these 'masqueraders', who are based on the masked revellers to be seen at the London pleasure gardens of Vauxhall and Ranelagh.",

Mallet's entry from the Rococo exhibition catalogue (see below) states:\n'Fourteen models from this series, recognizable by their scroll bases, their size and their subject-matter, have so far been identified, nine of which are in the present exhibition.  Eleven models are in the collection at Colonial Williamsburg; the six at Luton Hoo (Wernher Collection) include two further models, while yet another model of a man holding a bird-cage is illustrated by Stoner, 1955, pl. 32.  It has often been suggested (eg by Blunt, 1924) that these figures commemorate a masque held in honour of the Prince of Wales' birthday given in Ranelagh Gardens on 24th May, 1759.  However none of the figures correspond at all exactly to those shown in the engraving by Bowles after Maurer representing this ball (illustrated in Apollo, August 1969).   It is not even certain that the figures were intended to represent the well-to-do in fancy dress rather than Mountebanks or Mummers....'",
