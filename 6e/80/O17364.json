This powerful view shows the impressive spire through one of the ruined arches of the cloister.  A 'Picturesque' touch is given by the young boy with his hoop and basket.  Given Hoare's keen interest in archaeology and antiquarianism, it is clear that the prime intention of the work was to give a detailed and accurate delineation of the architecture, but Turner's brush and colours also convey the subtle and gentle play of warm, probably early morning, light across the stones and carvings.  It is also an excellent example of the range of chiaroscuro that Turner could achieve in the medium, from blazing sunlight to deepest shadow.",

These types of painted records are known as topographical paintings.\nTurner had trained as a topographical artist. However, he always found a view that was unconventional by the standards of the day, such as in this watercolour, painted in 1802. Here he has introduced some human interest to liven up an otherwise straightforward study of Salisbury Cathedral. A young boy has been playing with his toy hoop along the open passages of the cloister. He was probably on his way home from the market with a basket of produce.",
