Inscribed in ink by (presumably) the former owner c.1895 on a label on the backboard: <i>Peter Oliver son of Isaac Oliver/ 1601-1660/ This is a copy of a picture by Holbein at Hampton Court Palace formerly 1 in the collection of Henry VIII Oliver made numerous copies of celebrated pictures/ for Charles I</i>. \n\n<b>Provenance:</b> Presented to the Museum in May 1920 by Frederick Tessier Esq. of Brighton, who gave the following account of his acquisition of the miniature: 'I lived in Derbyshire some twenty-five years ago and walking through a neighbouring hamlet, Burnaston, I noticed a deserted hovel with an auction bill on it, walking in I saw the miniature lying on a table, it took my fancy and I sent a servant to buy it which he did for a few shillings, the place gave one the idea that at some time people in fair circumstances had lived there, but I made no enquiries, the frame is the original one.' (1)\n\n<b>Literature:</b> Long 1930, p. 36 (Anon., copy after Holbein); <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 30. \n\nThe miniature is very little-known and, except as above, unpublished. As Mr Tessier recognised, it is a copy after the painting at Hampton Court which was, at that time, c.1895, just emerging into general acceptance as a Holbein. (2) As Millar points out, controversy about the painting now centres on its date and place in Holbein's oeuvre; Millar himself argued that it was a response to the influence of the Italian High Renaissance pictures which Holbein had encountered on his visit to France, that it was possibly painted in France and that it had an important preparatory relation to Holbein's graphic work of the 1530s. Before Millar, the tendency had been to date the picture later, on the assumption that it had been painted by Holbein on his second visit to England (1532-43) and that it was the picture referred to in the King's inventories of 1542 and 1547. (3) Millar freed the question of this assumption by pointing out that Henry VIII's picture was not listed as a Holbein, and 'more significant, [it] cannot be identified in the documents that deal with the collection of Charles I, who does not, indeed, seem to have owned a picture of this subject'. Possibly, he suggests, the <i>Noli Me Tangere</i> may have belonged to Henrietta Maria, have been with her at Colombes in France and have come to Charles II at her death in 1669. The first reference to it is by Evelyn (September 1680) who saw it in the Private Lodgings at Whitehall; in James's brief reign it remained there, and was then removed to Kensington Palace and thence eventually to Hampton Court. \n\nThis history helps to locate the miniature as a later rather than an earlier seventeenth-century copy (for there can be no question of an earlier, sixteenthcentury, date: the table-book leaf support and other technical factors rule that out). Between, say, 1615 and the outbreak of war, the copyists working on paintings in the Royal Collection were Peter Oliver, Des Granges, Sir James Palmer, Richard Gibson and probably Balthasar Gerbier. Comparison of this miniature with the Peter Oliver copies catalogued here, and with the Des Granges at Ham House (Cat. No. 48) rules out the two leading copyists. Of the others, Gerbier seems to have a more linear, graphic and less painterly approach, and Palmer's work in this genre (the <i>Tarquin and Lucretia</i> referred to by Van der Doort) (4) is not extant. Palmer remains therefore a theoretical possibility, along with Gibson, whose style certainly was painterly, as in this miniature, but was surely always more opaque and impasted in the paint than is evident here. From the war and Interregnum there was Alexander Marshal, clearly from all we know of his work at Ham (Cat. No. 42), at the British Art Center at Yale and in the Windsor <i>Florilegium</i>, a painter in transparent washes, a more extreme 'water-colourist' as limners go than the painter here. Gibson and his family made copies after the Restoration: if the <i>Noli me Tangere</i> had a special appeal to James, as the more Catholic of his mother's sons, then Gibson would have been available as a member of the household to copy it for him; but the same technical and stylistic factors operate against Gibson at this date as pre-war. Is Flatman a candidate? This miniature is unsigned, and Flatman was a sign er, but he was a copyist of royal pictures and his copy after Domenico Fetti (Cat. No. 127) has features in common with this miniature. The construction of the features in brown and sanguine hatching blended into the carnation ground is at least reasonably consistent, and the painting of the landscape background has a similar balance between the broad summary wash drawing and the relatively minute gouache hatching. But these stylistic factors apply with greater plausibility to Nicholas Dixon; (5) who was certainly the most prolific copyist at work from the 1670s. Dixon was the King's Limner from September 1673, Keeper of the King's Picture Closet, and therefore the best placed of these later candidates to copy a putative new arrival in the Royal Collection. On 14 February 1707/8 he transferred under a deed of mortgage seventy of his miniature copies after Old Masters to the Duke of Newcastle, and these descended ultimately to Margaret (Cavendish), wife of the 2nd Duke of Portland, on the death of her father the 2nd Earl of Oxford in June 1741. Only thirty of the limnings survive at Welbeck Abbey. Welbeck is in Nottinghamshire, not far from Burnaston: is the <i>Noli Me Tangere</i> one of the forty escapees from the Welbeck Dixons, or at any rate one of the other copies by Dixon released onto the market in the course of the Hopeful Adventure Lottery? \n\n1 Department files. \n2 Millar 1963,vol.I,no.32, vol.II, pl. 22. \n3 W A Shaw, <i>Three Inventories of the Years 1542, 1547 and 1549-50 of Pictures in the Collections of Henry VIII and Edward VI (1937)</i>, no. 33 -'a table with the picture of our Lorde appearing to Mary Magdalen'. \n4 See entry for the Peter Oliver, <i>Tarquin and Lucretia</i>, Cat.
