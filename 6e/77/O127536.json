At the Universal Exhibition in Paris in 1900, he showed a frieze of animals after designs by the Sculptor Paul Jouve.  At his workshop at 13 Rue des Petits Ecuries, he specialised in architectural ceramics to his own designs and to designs by Henri Van de Velde, Hector Guimard and Louis Majorelle, among others.
