Gibson recorded that he was introduced by Mr Christie to Mr Watson Taylor, initially executing a bust of him and later his wife, his first commission after leaving Liverpool: 'Then I had commissions from them for all the children in turn, ending with the baby- a little thing with no shape at all.' \n\nThis bust and those of four other Watson Taylor children formed part of the Watson Taylor Collection, Erlestoke Park, Devizes, Wilts.\n\nGibson (1790-1866) was apprenticed to Messrs Franceys, the Liverpool firm of statuaries and later removed to Rome where he received instruction from Canova and Thorwaldsen. Elected A.R.A in 1833 and RA in 1838. He became the leading English sculptor of his generation working in the neo-classical style and was famous for such works as the Tinted Venus, Pandora, Mars and Cupid and Psyche and Zephers. He also executed public statues and busts. He bequeathed his property on his death to the Royal Academy. Gibson spent most of his career in Rome.",

According to his own account, Gibson was commissioned in 1817 to portray all the Watson Taylor children, after having first sculpted the father and mother. However in view of the date on the bust, the year 1817 mentioned by Gibson must be a mistake. The Watson Taylor busts were executed on the occasion of Gibson's first visit to London from Liverpool and before he had travelled to Rome.",
