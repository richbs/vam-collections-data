The subject is uncertain, though the figure may once have had mythological attributes, or was perhaps paired with another statuette.\nThis figure is typical both of early 18th century German carving and of the artist. Baur (1681-1760) practised as both a sculptor and goldsmith. He trained in Augsburg under the sculptor Joseph H\u00f6schler (Heschler) from 1695-9, and then travelled, probably spending several years in Berlin, where he may have been influenced by the work of the sculptor and wax modeller Raimund Faltz, before returning to Augsburg, where he was working as a sculptor by 1708. He carved stone sculpture, and also produced designs for silver and furniture, as well as executing small-scale reliefs in wood, based on engraved sources.",
