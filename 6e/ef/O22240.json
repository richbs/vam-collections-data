A jade-green glaze is clear and has a gentle luster. It is similar to the blue and white porcelain which were produced at Jingdezhen in China, in that the foot of the bowl is inward sloping and shallow on the inside bottom. The foot has marks of silica spurs at three points. Since this vessel is similar to the celadon bowl which was excavated off the coast of Wonsando Island in Boryeong, it is assumed that this celadon bowl was produced at a kiln site in Gangjin in the early 13th century.",
