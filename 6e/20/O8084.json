They were never intended for general production as they were so large and expensive to make. However, they functioned as advertisements for the firm's skills. Meigh's may also have hoped that the Royal Family would have admired their exhibition vases sufficiently to buy them.\n\nPeople\nCharles Meigh & Son, of Old Hall Pottery, Hanley, was a family company which had begun in about 1790, and later became known simply as Old Hall.  Most of the firm's products were earthenwares and stone china of a smaller more functional nature, although porcelain and Parian were exhibited at the Great Exhibition, where the company won a prize medal. \n\nSubjects Depicted\nThese vases were popular exhibits at the Great Exhibition because of their finely painted views of the Crystal Palace on one side, and patriotic portraits of the Queen and Prince Consort on the other.  To our eyes, these paintings are rather strangely juxtaposed with moulded gilt fronds, foliage and birds, but they demonstrate the prevalent Victorian interest in natural history and naturalistic forms.",
