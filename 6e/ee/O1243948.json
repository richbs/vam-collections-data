She wrote the majority of the Original Peter Rabbit Books between 1901 and 1913. &lt;i&gt;The Tale of Peter Rabbit&lt;/i&gt; (Frederick Warne, 1902) is her most famous and best-loved tale.\n\nAt first publishers rejected Beatrix's manuscript of 'The Tale of Peter Rabbit and Mr. McGregor's Garden' so she decided to publish the story herself in an edition of 250 copies with black and white illustrations and a colour frontispiece.  By the time her privately printed edition was published in December 1901 Frederick Warne had agreed to publish the story the following year as &lt;i&gt;The Tale of Peter Rabbit&lt;/i&gt;.  However, Warne specified that the story would have to be shorter with colour illustrations so early in 1902 Beatrix began editing her privately printed edition, removing eleven illustrations and altering the text accordingly.  A black and white version of this illustration appeared in the privately printed edition and it was Beatrix's original intention to include a colour version in Warne's first edition.  However, the colour version was  eventually rejected and remained unused until 2002 when Warne reinstated it in a new edition marking the centenary of &lt;i&gt;The Tale of Peter Rabbit&lt;/i&gt;.",
