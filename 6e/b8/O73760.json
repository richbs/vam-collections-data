It records that the animal's name is Mahabir Deb, that it had been presented to the emperor by 'Adil Khan, and that it was worth 300,000 rupees. The Bijapuri ruler sent regular tributes of money and valuable goods, including elephants, to the Mughal emperor. \nAn inscription on the back identifies the prince riding the elephant as Dara Shokuh, Shah Jahan's son. There are various seals on both sides of the painting; the earliest is dated 1643-4.",
