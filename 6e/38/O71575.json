His right arm is raised; his left rests on the top of the pulpit. He preaches to a group of five men, two of whom are clean-shaven, and two women, one of whom holds a rosary in her left hand. Across the top of the panel is a scroll. The panel has been placed in a modern alabaster frame. \n\nThe left arm of the seated male figure is missing. There are traces of green at the bottom of the panel with the remains of a daisy pattern. Traces of dark paint remain on the pulpit, the halo and on the background. The painted inscription on the scroll has virtually disappeared. The panel has been completely backed with a modern slab of alabaster strengthened with two long brass strips.",

Behind his head there is a large carved fluted halo. His right arm is raised and his left rests on the top of the pulpit. He preaches to a group of five men, two of whom are clean-shaven and two women one of whom holds a rosary in her left hand. Across the top of the panel there is a scroll.",
