The series of lobed outlines contained in this medallion enclose small floral motifs of which two are stems leading into the small red central form.  This central medallion is placed onto a symmetrical meander pattern in a half drop repeat; the blue meander stem bears large exotic red blossoms with blue, black and cream details. This central panel is framed by a border predominantly formed by a blue meander bearing flower heads.  Sections of this border are extended to create four corner squares within a wide border.  Each corner contains a single large blossom and stem on a cream ground  while the border contains a blue meander and scrolling stem bearing large and very small blossoms.  This border pattern changes direction, working around the central panel in an anti-clockwise direction. The whole is edged with a small repeating pattern of a cypress and blossom motif on a red and cream ground.  This leads into a wider version of the innermost border, again on a  cream ground, with a twin stems meander in mauve with blossoms.  The outermost border is a repeat of the cypress and blossom edging. \nThe backing is made from two pieces of cotton, probably machine woven.  It has a white ground peppered with little offset circles in mauve and red.\nThe facing is a roller printed cotton with red, blue and white floral stripes.\nA sleeve has been added at either end for display purposes.",
