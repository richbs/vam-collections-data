Like the angels of Chartres this angel is shown floating above wave-like clouds. As at Chartres this figure appears to derive from Burgundian Romanesque, some of the sculptures at V\u00e9zelay providing particularly close comparisons. The Chartres style of portal desoration spread throughout the \u00cele-de France  after the middle of the twelfth century and the porches at Etampes, Le Mans, St Ayoul at Provins, Ivry-La-Bataille, Vermenton, Angers and St Louo-de-Naud all share this common debt.  Although the original location of the is at the present unknown, there can be no question that it is a product of a workshop associated or familiar with the sculptures of the west portal of Chartres: as such it is an important detached example of sculpture from the revolutionary period of French sculpture - the transition between Romanesque and Gothic.\n\nThe angels are represented throughout the Bible as a body of spiritual beings intermediate between God and men: \"You have made him (man) a little less than the angels\" (Psalm 8:6). They appear throughout the Old and New Testament, occurring as attendants of  God, annunciators, protectors of the righteous, punishers of wrong doers, or they may be the mystic personification of God himself. They are most common however in their role as messengers for God's word. The appearance of this angel as a piece of church architecture helps reinforce the position of the church as intermediary between man and God.",
