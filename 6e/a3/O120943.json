This is one of the studies of flowers Mackintosh sketched during holidays from about 1901. Like his architecture, his drawings are stylised, but they are also accurate, showing the structure of the plant. \n\nThe watercolour was painted in Walberswick, Suffolk, which he visited with his wife, the artist Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh, in 1914. The watercolour bears the initials 'CRM' and 'MMM' - those of both the artsist and his wife. However, it is unlikely that Margaret had a hand in producing the image as Mackintosh would often note the initials of the person who was with him when he was sketching.",
