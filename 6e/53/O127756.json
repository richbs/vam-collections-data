            "public_access_description": "Great Britain\u2019s leading theatre designer from the early 1930s to the mid 1950s, Oliver Messel (1904-1978) won international acclaim for his lavish, painterly and poetic designs informed by period styles.  His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nIn 1955, Messel began designing costumes and sets for Arms and the Man, a film by Alexander Korda (1893-1956)  which did not go into production.   Based on a satirical play (1894) by George Bernard Shaw and set during the Serbo-Bulgarian War in 1885, Messel used reference photographs to create Balkan peasant costumes, soldier\u2019s uniforms and a Balkan setting.   \n\nMessel painted a delicate watercolour study of a traditional Balkan embroidered jacket and shirt.  He based his design on photographs of peasant costumes.",
