Inside the latter, scratched: <i>1/101.25.</i>  \n \n<b>Provenance:</b> Thomas Hugh Cobb, by whom bequeathed to the Museum, September 1944.  \n \n<b>Exhibited:</b> New Haven etc. 1981-2, no. 42 (as 'perhaps Ferdinand III, 1635-40').  \n \n<b>Literature:</b> Reynolds 1952, p. 65, pl. XI, fig. 28; Colding 1953, p. 1 18 (exemplifying Cooper's use of a violet background); Foskett 1963, p. 72; <i>Summary Catalogue</i>, 1981, p. 9; Murdoch 1981, pp. 125-6, col. pl. 19e; Reynolds 1988, p. 61, fig. 30. \n\nOn costume, the portrait should date fromc.1625-30, when the high-necked pinked doublet, supporting a narrow falling band of Flemish or Italian bobbin-lace, was in fashion in Europe. The waxed moustache and beard, together with the short hair brushed away from the face, were also current in the late 1620s, a development of the look adopted, in a much more English idiom, by international courtiers such as Nethersole (see Oliver, Cat. No. 8). The sitter here looks distinctly un-English, and Peter Barber has accordingly suggested (1) that he might be the Holy Roman Emperor, Ferdinand III (1608-1657), whose portraiture on his coinage the present image resembles. The suggestion is that the miniature might have been intended as a design for the new Emperor's coinage.  \n \nAlthough Alexander Cooper is thought to have left England some time in the early 1630s, and is known to have worked for Elizabeth of Bohemia and her Court in 1632-3, patronage by the Emperor has not previously been suggested. There seems to be no technical reason why an image intended for the use of the die-maker should itself be circular, and in terms of the history of miniatures the circular format was archaistic, even on the Continent, (2) and almost forgotten in English practice. The only reason to produce a round miniature at this date might therefore be if it were intended to be enclosed, as here, in a pre-existing circular object.  \n \nThe setting of miniature portraits inside hollowed-out coins was not unusual in the seventeenth century, reflecting the status of the miniature as a' curiosity' for the cabinet. In the present instance, the apparent fact that the coin is a 'mule' - that is, stamped from the obverse dies of two different coins - would obviously reinforce its status as a 'rarity'. But again, there are reasons for doubting whether the assemblage as it stands is indeed seventeenth-century. In the first place, if it were contemporary, there ought to have been an iconographic point in placing the Emperor's image between that of two other princes: but John George of Saxony and Christian of Brunswick were both rebellious Protestants, the latter an especially inveterate anti-Hapsburg. The only point could have been satirical, and this particular satire was not as far as I know current at the time. Secondly, there is no proof that the coin was a genuine mule: it could just as easily have been made from two ordinary coins - both sides are unevenly worn as though they had been in separate circulation for some time. Thirdly, the fact that the miniature is itself rubbed and abraded suggests that it has spent part of its life without a protective case. It is overwhelmingly likely that a royal image, if this were one, would originally have been fitted with a gold and enamel case, and that the case was subsequently, as so often, melted down for bullion.  \n \nThe miniature itself could therefore have been cut down from a more conventional oval format - the gold marginal strip is after all not on the vellum but on the card. The disappointing conclusion should therefore be that the assemblage as it stands is a much later antiquarian confection, probably nineteenth-century, made perhaps with a consciousness that German coins of this general period would be appropriate, but with no consciousness of the identity of the sitter, nor with any political comment in mind. \n\n1 Personal communication, 1978. \n2 Colding 1953, p. 109.\"",
