This gift of a bowl and spoon to Carol Vinson by her grandmother was the first of three christening presents over three years. In 1912 the child received a silver goblet, and in 1913 a child's cutlery set of a knife, fork and spoon.  All these pieces were made by Omar Ramsden (1873-1939) and Alwyn Carr (1872-1940).\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe shape of the bowl is adapted from the traditional form of a Scottish 'quaich'. A quaich, derived from the Gaelic word for cup, cuach, was originally a shallow, two-handled drinking vessel carved from solid wood. Omar Ramsden became particularly interested in adapting medieval prototypes and reinterpreting them in an Arts and Crafts style. This interest in historic silver had been kindled by the antiquary St John Hope, whom Ramsden met early in his career.\n\nPeople\nOmar Ramsden trained as a designer and silversmith at the Sheffield School of Art, Yorkshire, but spent his entire working career in London. He set up in partnership with Alwyn Carr, a fellow graduate, in 1899. When Carr returned from World War I in 1918 he left the partnership, and Ramsden managed the workshop and studio alone until his death in 1939.",
