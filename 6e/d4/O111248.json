In 1854 he entered the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, where he trained for four years. He was known for his left-wing political sympathies and was involved in the establishment of the Paris Commune in 1871. After his overthrow he was forced into exile in London, where he lived from 1871 until his return to Paris in 1879. In London he frequently exhibited at the Royal Academy and he was given a teaching appointment at the National Art Training School in South Kensington (later the Royal College of Art), where he had a profound effect on the development of British sculpture.\n\nDalou was based in Paris but spent the years of 1871\u20139 in London, where his teaching inspired a whole generation of students. Much of his London work concentrated on scenes of quiet domesticity, translated here into the tenderness with which the angel holds the dead child.",
