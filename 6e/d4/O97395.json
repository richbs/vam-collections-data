It continued to be popular on the hunting field for far longer. The conical grip was inserted into the end of the musket barrel converting it into a spear. The main drawbacks were that this prevented any further firing, while a poor fit or fouling of the barrel by unburnt gunpowder resulted in its loss in combat. The period when the plug bayonet was in favour coincided roughly with the transitionary period between pike and shot formations to wholly firearm equipped battalions in Europe.",
