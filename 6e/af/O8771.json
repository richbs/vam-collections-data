There is the same design on the reverse. On each shoulder, two confronted bats forming holes for hanging, with archaic scroll above.\nThe high angular foot has a high angular indentation underneath.\nThe decorative effect is angular and geometric.  This, together with the large character (which here is oddly difficult to read) suggest that this is a late bottle, perhaps made with a foreign market in mind.",
