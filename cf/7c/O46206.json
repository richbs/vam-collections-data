There is a border all round of conventional flower sprays.  At one end the border is three times as wide as the other.  In the centre are repetitions of the Sacred Monogram beneath a cross, and of the initial 'A' surmounted by a crown.\n\n1975 Description: both the silk and the linen were imported to Guatemala.  Possibly this piece was imported as it is, but it is likely that it was worked by Guatemalans for the Spanish colonists living there.\n\nNotes (1997): the ground is plain weave white linen.  The edges are rolled and oversewn with white cotton.  There are 48 warp threads per inch and 46 weft threads per inch.  The embroidery, with equal amounts of thread on either side, is worked with red floss silk.  One small patch of finer linen has been inserted in the upper part.  In the upper left there is a small square hole which has been filled with buttonholed bars worked with white cotton (?).  The upper band of embroidered letters is upside down, giving credence to the suggestion that this is a lectern cover.",
