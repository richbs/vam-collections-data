The ballets at the Alhambra and Empire Theatres are of great significance in the history of ballet in England as they ensured the continuity of a ballet tradition in London between the Romantic balllet and the 'new' ballet of the Diaghilev Ballets Russes.  Their design embodied the best qualities of late Victorian realistic, but imaginative, design.",
