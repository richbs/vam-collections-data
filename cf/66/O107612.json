These crowns refer to the concept of Mary's coronation as the Queen of Heaven by her son, Jesus Christ, after her death. It was a subject much favoured by artists and craftsmen working for Catholic patrons. Veneration of the Virgin was particularly encouraged after the Counter Reformation in the mid 16th century, a period of reform and reinvigoration within the Roman Catholic church.\n\nThis crown consists of a plain inner circlet of gilt copper onto which is riveted a decorative eight-pointed framework of gilt copper scrolls, hammered leaves and twisted wire. The framework is ornamented with crystals, foiled pastes and imitation pearls.",

Internal dissent was undermining its authority and whole nations were going over to the new Protestant faiths. To clarify its role, the church held the Council of Trent from 1545 to 1563. It addressed concerns about religious education, abuses of wealth and the relief of the poor. The Society of Jesus (the Jesuits) became the champion of the reformed Catholic church and promoted the faith worldwide. At the heart of this Counter Reformation was the need to restore the Eucharist to the centre of worship. In Catholic belief, the Eucharist enshrines the moment when bread and wine, consecrated at the altar, are transformed into the body and blood of Christ. A priest holding up a monstrance Detail from The Adoration of the Holy Eucharist, by Claudio Coello, 1685-90 Monasterio del Escorial, Madrid.\n\nArt and Faith \nThe image and message of the reinvigorated Roman Catholic church were actively promoted through dramatic architecture and furnishings. Throughout the 17th century new churches were built in the grand Baroque style. Their sumptuous interiors were complemented by elaborate monstrances, candelabra, sanctuary lamps and censers. Awe-inspiring altar silver drew the eyes of the faithful towards the Eucharist.",
