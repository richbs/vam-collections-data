            "public_access_description": "This is one of a pair of ivory panels which appear to copy early Christian models, perhaps of the 5th century. The narrative takes place as an integrated sequence, rather than separating events out. Thus the wise men following the star, the Nativity and the Adoration of the Magi are shown in one.\n\nThis is a panel from a casket (known as the Werden Casket) probably made about 800 in the Lower Rhine area, possibly Werden. The date and origin of these palquettes have been the subject of considerable scholarly debate, with the majority of authorities devided between an Early Christian and Caorlingan origin.\nThis and the two other ivory panels from the Abbey of Werden in the V&A collection depict a mixture of scenes from Biblical and Apocryphal stories. They have been linked stylistically to a book-cover in the treasury of Milan Cathedral and other surviving panels and pyxides. The scenes of the Annunciation, the Magi seeing the Star, the Nativity and the Adoration of the Magi closely resemble the Milan book covers.\nOther panels which are thought to belong to the same group can be found in the Berlin, Toulouse and Nevers museums and also possibly a panel in the British Museum representing Christ disputing with the Doctors. Three pyxides, one still at Werden, one in the museum at Rouen and the third in Florence have also been identified as belonging to the same group.",

They have been linked stylistically to a book-cover in the treasury of Milan Cathedral and other surviving panels and pyxides. The panels which are thought to belong to the same group can be found in  the Berlin, Toulouse and Nevers museums and also possibly includes a panel in the British Museum representing Christ disputing with the Doctors. Three pyxides, one still at Werden, one in the museum at Rouen and the third in Florence have also been identified as belonging to the same group.\n\n<font -b>The Preaching of John the Baptist </font>:This event is recorded in the Gospel of Matthew 3:1 in which John arrives in Judea to preach and baptise to prepare the way for the coming of Christ\n\n<font -b>The Axe Laid to the Root of the Tree</font>:  This scene is taken from the preaching of John as told in Matthew 3:11 \"the axe is laid to the root of the tree: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.\" a motif of John's preaching is that he draws similies from the flora and fauna of the Holy Land.\n \n<font -b>The Baptism of Christ in the Jordan</font> :As told by Matthew, Christ approaches John to be baptised and John is worried that it should be Christ baptising him.  The river Jordan is personified on this panel by a reclining male figure with an urn. Conway has suggested that the river-god is of Nile type and that the figure marks the ivory as Alexandrian. A very similar figure appears on a mosaic in the Arian Baptistery at Ravenna : personifications of rivers are frequent in Graeco-Roman art.\n\n The eastern or western origin of this panel has been much debated. The architecture depicted on panel 149-1866 may be an indication of oriental origin: the facade flanked by two towers is a style of architecture associated with the Christian East. The shed-like roof over the nativity scene on the present panel is a more western feature. Dalton concludes that the precise localisation of the ivories can only be conjectural.",
