            "public_access_description": "The Vezzi factory in Venice was one of the earliest to follow the lead of Meissen in producing true porcelain in Europe.  It was founded by the courtier and politician Giovanni Vezzi in 1720 who managed to tempt skilled technicians to come to Venice and enable him to turn his desire to produce porcelain into reality.  A few came directly from Meissen, but most came from Vienna, where du Paquier's factory had already benefited from the technical expertise developed at Meissen.  Thanks to this early instance of industrial espionage, for a few years the Vezzi factory produced a range of interesting tea, coffee and other decorative wares using clay found in the Veneto region nearby.  Not surprisingly, its shapes owe a lot to those developed at Vienna and Meissen, as with this faceted teapot.  The factory closed in 1727, so Vezzi pieces are rare and highly sought after.",
