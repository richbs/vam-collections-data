This was the Prince\u2019s last night in the USA, after a long post-war tour of Canada which ended with a  visit to New York.\n\nThis show, produced by Charles Dillingham, was probably one of the most spectacular on offer anywhere in the world. Built in 1905, the Hippodrome was the largest and most successful theatre in New York with a seating capacity of 5,200, a tank containing 8,000 gallons of water that could be raised and lowered from the stage which could hold 1,000 performers or be transformed into a circus ring. The Hippodrome specialised in lavish spectacles complete with circus animals, diving horses, opulent sets, and 500-member choruses. Happy Days featured sixteen spectacular scenes, performing elephants, bareback riding, \u2018Disappearing Divers\u2019, \u2018the Wonderful Water Girls\u2019 and a Grand Finale with the entire Hippodrome Company.",
