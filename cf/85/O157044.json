He studied at Hornsey and the Royal College of Art; at the latter he was a fellow student of David Hockney, R.B. Kitaj, Derek Boshier and Peter Phillips who were to become some of the most important British artists of their generation and with whom he shares certain qualities of picture-making. Although his work has much in common with theirs, his work has tended to focus on the erotic and fetishism associated with  female sexuality. His images of women, or parts of woment, often half-naked, or clad in tightfitting garments and stiletto heels, have been criticised by feminist writers such as Laura Mulvey and Lisa Tickner as fantasies of sexual objectification. However, others have argued that his representations are intended, rather, as a criticism of the objectification he portrays.",
