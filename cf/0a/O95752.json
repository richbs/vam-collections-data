He staged the first exhibition in his London shop in the spring of 1899. Although he registered the mark at the Goldsmiths' Company in his name, most of the silver and jewellery was made by W. H. Haseler of Birmingham, who became a joint partner in the project. Oliver Baker and the Silver Studio in Brook Green, London, supplied designs. One of the most gifted designers that the Silver Studio employed was Archibald Knox. He came from the Isle of Man and had worked for the designer Christopher Dresser. He supplied most of the Liberty metalwork designs between 1899 and 1912.",
