They may have been intended for display, or to contain such specific information as routes to London or coach fares. Silk would have provided a convenient and easily foldable support, more permanent than paper. By the beginning of the 18th century commemorative designs were also being printed on silk, and by 1713 this type of object was being described as a 'printed handkerchief'.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe design used here of arabesques with roundels containing coats of arms around the borders is known from other handkerchiefs. It must have been printed from a re-usable engraved metal plate that had a central space for inserting a topical design.\n\nSubjects Depicted\nThe handkerchief gives 'An account of 5 most glorious victorys obtaind by the confederets in 3 succeding campains viz Schellenberg Hochstadt Barcelona Ramilly & Turin'. These victories were under the leadership of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough (1650-1722), appointed Captain General of British Forces and Supreme Commander of Allied Forces, following the French invasion of the Spanish Netherlands in 1701. Marlborough is considered one of the foremost strategists and military administrators in British history.",
