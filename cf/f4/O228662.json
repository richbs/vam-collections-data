In the centre of the cover is a large oval medallion outlined in faded pink and containing 8 blossoms in faded pink silk and metal thread, linked by fine blue stems to form a star with blue leaves and small pink buds.  In the centre is a faded pink rosette.  In each corner of the central panel is a quarter of an 8-pointed star with two partial silk blossoms and a whole silk and metal thread blossom, blue stems and leaves. Blue stems and leaves and faded pink blossoms, the larger one containing metal thread, form a curving design over the ground.  The whole ground has been quilted with white silk in a small diamond pattern and the larger leaves are outlined in dark blue.  Very elegant design; slightly large scale.\nBacking: plain weave white cotton.\nFacing: bias cut plain weave silk; light and dark blue creating a fine check.\nMetal Thread: silver strip close S-wound on white silk core.",
