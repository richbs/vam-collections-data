Paxton proposed using the recently invented smokeless pneumatic railway, in conjunction with covered streets, lined with high-class shops and superior dwellings, to make what was, from the point of view of transport facilities at least, a prophetic forerunner of the Circle Line, which now largely uses the route that Paxton put forward.",
