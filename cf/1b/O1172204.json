It is made from layered birch wood, with printed design and ropes that are knotted through two holes on either side of the seat, which can be used to hang the seat from a tree. The graphics on the underside of the seat were created by Njoi CoLab, a design studion specialising in graphics for skateboarding. \n\nThe swing has been designed to be used by both adults and children, and, according to the manufacturer, can be set up either in the home or office to 'swing the day away'. It is a good example of high-quality Scandinavian design, using traditional methods and materials. The skateboarding graphics make the design more contemporary.",

The use of wood is a particular speciality, and all of the products are hand-made. The design on the underside of the seat was designed by Jan Fagerroos, who worked for the Helsinki-based design studio Njoi CoLab, who mainly produce skateboard designs and graphics, and with whom Tunto have collaborated. It was acquired for use in the V&A Museum of Childhood's 'Sit Down' exhibition in 2010.\n\nHistorical significance: This swing is a modern twist on a timeless classic children's plaything, and embodies not only the characteristics traditionally associated with Scandinavian design, such as the use of wood and natural materials and a broadly ecological approach, but also updates this with reference to  contemporary skateboarding  graphics.",
