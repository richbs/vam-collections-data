He married Jemyma, daughter of Sir Robert Harpur, fourth baronet, in 1724. He succeeded his father in 1732 and was sherrif of Nottinghamshire in 1740-41 and member of Parliament for Leicestershire from 1754 until his death. (Schroder, 1988, p. 187).  Next known owner probably Col. S. J. L. Hardie; sale, Sotheby's, December 4, 1969, lot 242. Purchased from S. J. Phillips, Ltd., London, 1970 by Rosalinde and Arthur Gilbert. The Britannia standard mark on each foot has been partially obliterated by the rivets, suggesting that the salver was sent to the assay office before being finished (cited in Schroder, 1988, p.187).\n\nProvenance: Sir Thomas Palmer, East Carlton and Carlton Curlieu, Northamptonshire. Probably Col.  S.J.L. Hardie, sale; Sotheby's, lot 242, Dec. 4, 1969.  Purchased from S. J. Phillips, Ltd., London, 1970.  Rosalinde and Arthur Gilbert.\n\nHistorical significance: This salver is unusual in that no solder has been used and the rivets have been polished down so as not to show on the upper side of the salver (normally they are left plainly visible) (Schroder, T., 1988, p.187).",
