Roller printing on textiles was introduced in the late 18th century and at first used mainly for small-patterned dress fabrics. By the 1830s it had become a highly mechanised process, and had largely replaced block printing in the production of fashionable furnishings.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe development of roller printing coincided with a radical transformation in the dyestuffs available for printing on cotton. Until the beginning of the 19th century printing had been based on the use of vegetable dyes. In Britain, France and Germany new chemical processes were developed and mineral colours produced that transformed the palette of colours available to the printer and made combinations such as the green and shades of pink seen here possible.\n\nTime\nThe styles considered fashionable in 1830s furnishings were widely diverse. Among the more recognisable historical references were to the Rococo, Elizabethan and Gothic. A design such as this, however, seems to be aiming for success by novelty of effect, a taste encouraged by the developing technology of dyeing and printing.",
