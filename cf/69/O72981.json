Laurence Arthur Turner (1864-1957) was a Fellow of the Institute, as well as a Past Master of the Art Workers Guild. At the British Empire Exhibition held at Wembley, London, in 1924, Turner exhibited a plaster model of the arms of Queen Elizabeth I for Liberty's new building, and he was also involved in the supervision of a room decorated in the style of 1888. He initially studied at the Kennington School of Art. He was an accomplished wood carver and was often employed by church architects: he carved William Morris's tomb at Kelmscott, designed by Philip Webb.",
