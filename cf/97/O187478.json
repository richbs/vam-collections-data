The technique involved piercing designs directly through the walls of the extremely fine-grained, pure white body; the windows or cavities were filled in with the clear transparent glaze creating translusect windows. Often these simple designs were enhanced with underglaze painting in blue and black. A similar piercing technique was found in Chinese porcelain in the 16th century.",

The technique involved piercing designs directly through the walls of the extremely fine-grained, pure white body; the windows or cavities were filled in with the clear transparent glaze creating translusect windows. Often these simple designs were enhanced with underglaze painting in blue and black. A similar piercing technique was found in Chinese porcelain in the 16th century.",
