There are four figures in total, two are seated in chairs (in obvious discomfort) as their feet tied to the base with scarlet ribbon. These seated gentlemen are wearing breeches that button at the knee and loose jackets underneath long white bibs which tie at the neck. The man in the centre is leaning away from the cloud of powder which a figure (perhaps the barber) is thrusting in his direction. This figure is wearing a tight fitting red outfit cross hatched with gold triangular pattern and with blue sections at the ankle, knee and wrist. He is also wearing a long, extravagant wig and his face appears to have been artificially darkened. In the background is another small figure dressed in a bright pink and purple outfit with a white apron. A metal sign on the building in the background reads 'Chirurgyn a La Mode'.",
