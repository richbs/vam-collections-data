            "public_access_description": "This is photographic artwork, used to create a lithographic plate, related to the song Who Killed Bambi?, designed by Jamie Reid (b.1947). The song was a b-side to the single Silly Thing, which was released as a Sex Pistols single, long after the band had broken up, and Sid Vicious (1957-79), singer on the main track, had died of an overdose.\n\nThe image of the dead deer is a still from the mock documentary The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle, from footage for an earlier film about the band that Malcolm McLaren had tried to set up. It was to be directed by Russ Meyer, an American director of sexploitation films, and to be entitled Who Killed Bambi?; only a few minutes of footage emerged, however, before the project was abandoned. The title was later reused for a song featuring Ed Tudor-Pole as a replacement singer for Johnny Rotten.\n\nJamie Reid's cut-and-paste aesthetic developed from his interest in radical politics. His artistic style developed while at art college in Croydon, where he was influenced by the ideas of the avant-garde political group, the Situationist International. The political slant to his art was aroused by the May 1968 Paris student riots, which inspired fraternal protests organised by Reid at the Croydon College of Art. These were directed with fellow student Malcolm McLaren, later to become the manager of the Sex Pistols.",
