The following is the full text of the entry: ?BRIZZI (BRIZIO, BRICCIO, BRITIUS)FRANCESCO (c. 1575-1623) 639 Design for a title page or for a setting to a coat of arms Inscribed in a 17th century hand 'Bricio' Pen and ink 8 \u00bd x 5 3/4 (216 x 146) D.1110-1887 PROVENANCE Bought 1887 The old attribution is retained, though difficult to confirm. Brizzi engraved a number of frontispieces and coats of arms in allegorical settings like this. (See Bartsch, 18, pp. 259-67). It is not clear whether an allegory is intended in this design and if so what it means. Each of the two youths holds a spud; one has a pipe in his hand and both appear to have bagpipes slung over their shoulders, while a set of pan-pipes lies on the ground.",
