This plate was produced by Royal Doulton, the firm that began in Lambeth, London, when John Doulton manufactured ceramic items such as stoneware bottles and sewer pipes. The Victorian revolution in hygiene and sanitation ensured its success, and Doulton later produced tableware and commemorative items.  They moved to Burslem in The Potteries in 1882, added porcelain to their production two years later and were granted a Royal Warrant in 1901.\n\nThe image of Shakespeare on this plate was based on the copper plate engraving by Martin Droeshout published as a frontispiece to the First Folio of Shakespeare's works in 1623. Since Droeshout was only fifteen when Shakespeare died, it is unlikely that they ever met. This image is thought to be based on descriptions by his fellow actors.",
