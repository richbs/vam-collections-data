They are used to transport possessions on pack animals when the community travels and are used for storage and decoration, and as something comfortable to lean against, when the community settles for a while and erects tents.  The two sides of a bag, back and front, are called 'faces' and the one at the front is often decorated with knotted pile or with a woven design. This is the decorative pile face of a large storage bag probably made by the Salor tribe. Blue braid has been sewn along the lower edge to cover the raw edge - this is where the bag face was cut from the undecorated back panel. Small amounts of light purple silk have been used in the pile.",
