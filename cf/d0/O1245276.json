It was a relatively cheap toy to buy, and is made of thin metal, painted and folded and held in place using split pins. It is reminiscent of a 17th century rapier or 18th century small sword, with a decorated guard and scabbard, and would have been used during children's imaginative war play, on its own or in conjunction with other pieces of costume.",
