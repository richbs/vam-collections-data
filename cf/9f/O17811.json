For two years between 1916 and 1918 Roberts served in the British army and was appointed an Official War Artist. This powerful image is partly representational and partly abstract in style. The physical exertion is expressed in the strong diagonal lines of the limbs of the men as well as the ladders and sheets of camouflage material.",

Its subject is based on the camouflage work I took part in, when the Arras attack was being prepared.' Roberts was sent to France with the Royal Field Artillery in 1916; in 1918 he was appointed Official War Artist, as were many of his peers, including Lewis and Nash. He completed two large oils as official commissions, but these were less effective works than the small informal drawings such as this. Although it has been squared up with red crayon, this was simply for decoration and no oil was worked up from the sketch. \n\nRoberts displayed a precocious talent which won him a Scholarship to the Slade School of Art. In 1914, having travelled in France and Italy, he allied himself with the rebellious avant-garde of English art, the Vorticists. However, the principles of Vorticism, which combined the energy and dynamism of Futurist aesthetics with the fragmented form of Cubism, remained essentially a peripheral influence on his own fiercely independent style.  \n\nHis first one-man show, at the Chenil Galleries in 1923, included a number of these war drawings. In the catalogue introduction Muirhead Bone praised them for 'a delightful quality of mordant irony'. The influential art critic PG Konody, reviewing the exhibition, said: 'Mr Roberts proves triumphantly that his Weird Vorticist designs, with all their geometric distortion and grim caricaturist humour are based on powerful draughtsmanship and knowledge of form'. Konody exaggerates the influence of Vorticism on these drawings. Roberts had never been fully committed to the movement, and his allegiance was further weakened by the demands of realising actual observed experience. Vorticism was fundamentally an art of theory which failed to resolve the conflict between 'truth to life' and the radical use of pure abstract forms.\n\nThe anonymous figures owe little to Vorticism beyond a certain mechanistic style. Often in painting such formalization is an arbitrary device; here it is a purposeful and appropriate metaphor for the dehumanizing process of war in which men are stripped of their individuality to become machines of destruction. The angular forms also serve to characterize the devastated landscape. The composition has obvious iconographical parallels with the traditional representation of the Deposition of Christ - the camouflage blanket is a winding sheet, the blasted trees stand like crosses, whilst the actions of lifting and pushing could equally be interpreted as gestures of horror or supplication. It is an ironic comment on the terrible sacrifice of innocent lives. \n\nGillian Saunders\"\nJavier Arnaldo <u> \u00a11914!
