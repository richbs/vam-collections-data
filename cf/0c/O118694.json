It may have formed part of a figural group, probably an Annunciation or Visitation.

Bridlington Priory was an important Augustinian house.\nGiven by Dr G. Zarnecki, 1950.\n\nHistorical significance: The way in which the folds of the fabric are rendered in this piece is typical for its date and place of manufacture. The fabric clings to the upper leg of the figure in a style sometimes called 'damp fold', which was popular in England from the middle of the century, and has often been attributed to Byzantine influence. At the same time, the trough-like folds with rounded ends which form the looser parts of the garment look forward to a later, more naturalistic style of drapery.",
