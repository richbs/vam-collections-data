Such a silk might have been used for a woman's gown, a man's waistcoat or his nightgown, worn informally at home. We know that in this case it came from a woman's gown or petticoat, as it still has some of its original trimming attached.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe fairly complicated woven structure of this silk is highlighted with brocading. The technique of brocading allowed different colours to be introduced into the pattern of a fabric in specific, sometimes very small areas. It was a more laborious process for the weaver than using patterning wefts running from selvedge to selvedge, but the resulting effect could be much more varied and lively.",
