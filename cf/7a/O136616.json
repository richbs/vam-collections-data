            "public_access_description": "Resembling the form and style of a film poster, this work by Lesley Roberts offers a damning critique on the racist behaviour of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) in the year in which four LAPD staff were acquitted of beating the black motorist Rodney King. The acquittal sparked fierce rioting, particularly amongst the predominantly black neighbourhoods of south-central Los Angeles.\n\nRoberts presents the four accused police officers - Laurence Powell, Stacey Koon, Timothy Wind and Theodore Briseno - as the \u2018stars\u2019 of a film titled \u2018The Saints\u2019. The LAPD \u2018would be the perfect criminals if they weren\u2019t the perfect cops\u2019. Other information highlights the racially-sensitive nature of the trial: the film is based on an original idea by \u2018White Supremacist\u2019 and special guest stars include \u2018Ku Klux Klan\u2019. \n\nThe four acquitted police officers faced a second trial a year later, on federal charges of violating Rodney King's civil rights. Stacey Koon and Laurence Powell were found guilty: each served two years in jail. Timothy Wind and Theodore Briseno were cleared. Rodney King won $3.8m damages from the City of Los Angeles.",
