The panels of two warriors embracing are copied from the well-known porphry group of the Tetrarchs, of the early 4th century, on the exterior of St Mark's at Venice, and the figures of the Emperor and Empress, and the Christ blessing above, from a miniature in an 11th century Byzantine manuscript of the Homilies of St John Chrysostom in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale at Paris.\nThe panel was identified as counterfeit as early as 1865. Other products of the same workshop are known: 2 pairs of Byzantine Emperors and Empresses and a large panel in the form of a Veneto-Romanesque church fa\u00e7ade with figures in niches. It is questionable if any of these pieces were intended to deceive and likely that they were made as tourist souvenirs.",

A manuscript produced in Constantinople and dated to either 1074-78 or 1078-81.\nThe panel was identified as counterfeit as early as 1865. Other products of the same workshop are known: 2 pairs of Byzantine Emperors and Empresses and a large panel in the form of a Veneto-Romanesque church fa\u00e7ade with figures in niches. It is questionable if any of these pieces were intended to deceive and likely that they were made as tourist souvenirs.",
