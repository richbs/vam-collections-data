In the upper scene, showing the Crucifixion, the two soldiers can be seen: Longinus with his spear and Stephaton with a bucket and\nvinegar sponge.\nBooks which were kept in Carolingian and Ottonian  treasuries were highly valued and had their contents glorified through the addition of decorative book covers. These could be adorned with expensive and highly worked materials: precious metals, jewels, semi-precious stones and often ivory. This ivory panel was probably a book cover. It has been punctured with three holes, presumably for attachment. It belongs to a group of ivories, probably from the same workshop, which include a panel in Essen and a casket in the Victoria and Albert Museum (216-1866). The lower part of the scene of the Maries at the sepulchre is almost identical to that on the casket, and that of the Harrowing of Hell is also very similar.",

It has been punctured with three holes, presumably for attachment. It belongs to a group of ivories, probably from the same workshop, which include a panel in Essen and a casket in the Victoria and Albert Museum (216-1866). The lower part of the scene of the Maries at the sepulchre is almost identical to that on the casket, and that of the Harrowing of Hell is also very similar.\n\n.",
