The three lines scored into the canister and lid rims show it was originally one of a set of at least three similar vessels. The hinged lid allowed it to be stowed comfortably in a box.\nA toilet service, as the name suggests, was a set of vessels and implements specifically for morning grooming rituals. A toilet service included a mirror, combs, small boxes for powders and creams, larger canisters for perfumed waters and dyes, and even bowls for broth that was consumed during these preparations. Such services were particularly fashionable in the second half of the seventeenth century, and were often gifts from a groom to his bride. \nHans Scholler, whose mark ('HS' in monogram in an oval punch) is on the underside of the canister, became a master goldsmith at Leipzig (Saxony) in 1642. Several screw-top flasks and vessels embossed with flowers survive with his mark.",

The three lines scored into the canister and lid rims show it was originally one of a set of at least three similar vessels. The hinged lid allowed it to be stowed comfortably in a box.\nHans Scholler, whose mark ('HS' in monogram in an oval punch) is on the underside of the canister, became a master goldsmith at Leipzig (Saxony) in 1642. Several screw-top flasks and vessels embossed with flowers survive with his mark (Rosenberg: 1911, no. 1965, pp. 420-21). The City Museum and Art Gallery, Birmingham acquired a very similar canister with the date letter 'O' in the 1960s (inventory no. M79-1965). The date letter 'M' on the V&amp;A piece probably refers to the assay year 1642 since a communion cup in the Leipzig Thomaskirche (also by Scholle) with the 'M' letter punch is also engraved with the date '1662' (Rosenberg: 1911, no. 1965 [d]).\nNothing is known of the early owners of the canister; it was bequeathed to the Museum by the American scientist and collector W. H. Hildburgh in 1956.",
