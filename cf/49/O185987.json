Hardwick's extensive measured survey of the Pantheon completed during his stay in Italy was considered by contemporary architectural students as a paragon of antiquity. The partnership allowed Soane to obtain access to Hardwick's earlier drawings of the Pantheon and he copied at least three. This drawing is an example of a widespread practice among student architects abroad which has come to light since the chance discovery of the Soane and Hardwick suites. Due to increased competition 18th-century students were pressured to seek short-cuts to compile impressive portfolios. Consequently, out-in-the-open partnerships, clandestine collaborations and copying of drawings were common practice among the neo-classicists.",
