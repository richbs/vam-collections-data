            "public_access_description": "One of the earliest engravings to be made in Italy, this print was the first that reproduced a known piece of artwork and labelled itself as such. The image comes from a fresco in the Camposanto in Pisa. This print's wide circulation made the fresco famous. The maker of the print is unknown but he was probably working in Florence because he used the Fine Manner style of engraving associated with that city with its tradition of niello engraving. The style is characterised by cross-hatching in the darker shaded areas and well-defined contour lines, produced using a round-ended burin called a ciappollo. A famous Florentine engraver and niellist, Baccio Baldini worked in a similar style. Baldini is thought to have used this print as a source for some of his own images of Hell.\n\nThe fresco was painted in the late 1340s, now attributed to Francesco Triani. This image of Hell follows more traditional iconography seen in earlier frescos and mosaics, but combines this with some new details from Dante's description of Inferno in his Divine Comedy. The Camposanto fresco became a sensation when it was first painted, probably its most original and influential imagery being the gluttons being force-fed at the dinner table. Recognisable imagery from older sources include avarice, the soul bottom left being force-fed molten gold coins (being emptied into a cauldron near-by). Some of the numerous crowned figures below Satan's feet are named, as is Simon Magus, the 'father of heretics'.",

Meiss 1933, pp. 97-173; and, for detailed illustrations in addition to a summary of the attribution controversy, Carli 1958-61, vol. I (1958), pp. 55-61, pls. 114-18). The mural was in poor condition as early as the fourteenth century, and Giuliano Sollazzino's restoration of 1530 ... followed at least three previous campaigns ... Given these circumstances, in some resepects the engraving conveys a better impression of the original composition than the fresco itself. Convinced of this, Alessandro da Morrona published an impression of [it] in his early guidebook tothe city of Pisa, printing it from the original copper plate in his possession ... Engraved on the other side of Morrona's plate was the St. Jerome in Penitence, which also exists in a relatively large number of modern impressions ... The two prints are surely by the same hand, that of a Florentine artist from the circle of Baccio Baldini (to whom Passavant, Kollof, and Phillips attributed them). Although suggested dates have ranged from ca. 1460-80 to ca. 1480-1500, the present writer tentatively favors a period around 1470, regarding the 1460s as somewhat too early and the 1480s or 1490s as somewhat too late.'\n'A distinctive feature of both the present item and its companion is the use of metal punches of various sizes to produce patterns of circles ... The engraving is noteworthy for being the earliest surviving printed copy of a painting whose status as a reproduction is acknowledged on the plate itself.'\nIconographic discussion on page 167.\nMeiss, Millard.
