Jade was used to fashion royal wine cups, dagger and sword hilts and jewellery, and was probably seen only at the highest levels of the court. By the second half of the 17th century its use was increasingly common, and the jade was often studded with jewels set in gold that was so highly refined its softness allowed it to be shaped round the gemstones to hold them in place. This thumbring came from the famous collection formed by Colonel Charles Seton Guthrie, who served in India from 1828 to 1857. He stayed in India for several years after his retirement, and was thus in a position to buy jades and other hardstones from the royal collections that were being broken up as British rule steadily encroached, leading to the 1857 Sepoy Revolt.",
