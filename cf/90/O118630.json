Fej\u00e9r had been constantly developing new ideas for kitchens throughout the 1950s and 1960s, and this design clearly shows how they had changed. He made this drawing while working for Hygena in Liverpool, a company which had been involved in manufacturing kitchen cabinets from the 1920s and was well-established in the kitchen market during the 1970s and 1980s. \n\nBy the time this design was made the basic form of kitchens had been established, with long continuous surfaces over matching fitted cupboards and cookers. The design emphasis shifted to style and, as inscribed on the sheet, the attention in 1974 was on the outlines with \u2018softened contours\u2019.",
