            "public_access_description": "This watercolour sketch is entitled 'Supper Party at the Lyceum'. It shows the Actor/Manager Sir Henry Irving (1838-1905) presiding over a dinner party at the Lyceum Theatre. A number of gentlemen are seated around the table and to the left of this main image are several head and shoulder sketches labelled 'Some of the Guests'. These head and shoulder images are each annotated with the name of the individual represented and comprise:  the famous actor and theatre manager, Mr George Alexander (1858\u20131918);  Irving's leading lady Miss Ellen Terry (1847-1928); the journalist and writer Mr. Joseph Comyns Carr (1849-1916) and Mr Choate, The American Ambassador. \nIt was created for publication in an illustrated magazine or newspaper, probably the Penny Illustrated Paper. The image was painted by A.J. Finberg (1866-1939) and is signed with his initials. \n\nTerry and Irving were among the leading stage of the Victorian Era, Irving becoming the first actor to receive a knighthood in 1895. Their on-stage partnership began in 1878 when Irving first engaged Terry as his leading lady. Their first production together was Hamlet and featured Irving in the title role with Terry as Ophelia. They worked together for over twenty years, their final performance at the Lycuem taking place in 1902 when the pair appeared together in a production of the Merchant of Venice. Irving played the role of Shylock and Terry that of Portia. During his management of the Lyceum Theatre Sir Henry Irving became famous for the dinners that he hosted within the Theatre and the guests at these exclusive gatherings included many of the leading artists and figures of the day. \n\nAlexander Joseph Finberg (1866-1939) was born in London in 1866. He studied art at the Lambeth School of Art and in Paris and went on to work for the Graphic and Illustrated London News, and as art critic for several papers including the Manchester Guardian and the Saturday Review.\n\nThis item is one of several theatrical drawings from a collection of sketches commissioned from contemporary artists to be printed in illustrated magazines. The collection was donated to the museum by Sir William James Ingram in 1914.",
