            "public_access_description": "This panel probably represents the Apostle St Peter. In the Middle Ages, images of saints depicted in glass, stone or wood, or painted on walls, could be identified by the attributes they carry. Jesus Christ gave St Peter the keys of heaven, so he is traditionally depicted holding keys. However, the clear, or white, glass used to make up the key in this panel is later in date, so we cannot be sure if the original glass depicted a key.\n\nWe can be sure that this figure was one of the Apostles because we know that it came from a band window in the clerestory (upper part of the main walls) of the north transept of S\u00e9es Cathedral in Normandy. There are still some stained-glass panels depicting Apostles there, and they are very similar in style to this one. Band windows are composed of panels of single figures sandwiched between areas of clear glass with painted details (grisaille glass).\n\nJean de Berni\u00e8res, Bishop of S\u00e9es 1278\u201396, probably commissioned the windows. His image appears in a window lower down, in the north transept chapel.",
