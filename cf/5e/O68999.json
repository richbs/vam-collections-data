The hexagonal base, decorated with six enamelled panels of angels bearing symbols of the Passion, resembles a 15th-century salt commissioned by Bishop Fox in the collection of Corpus Christi College. The stem and bowl are derived from a chalice at Trinity College, Oxford.\n\nPeople\nFrancis A. Skidmore, the designer of the chalice, was the son of a Coventry watchmaker, jeweller and silversmith. He was apprenticed to his father and also studied historic metalwork. Together they founded the firm, Francis Skidmore & Son in 1845. He became a member of the Oxford Architectural Society and the Ecclesiological Society. By the early 1850s the firm was making silver and other metalwork for outside designers like Sir George Gilbert Scott. An important manufacturer in the Gothic revivalist style, Skidmore's were also responsible for restoration work on a number of cathedrals.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe chalice was gilded using an electric current. This new technology of electrogilding, as well as that of electroplating and electrotyping, had been promoted by the Birmingham manufacturers Elkington & Co. By 1851 all these techniques were widely used in the trade. Electrogilding was an important advance in technology as the process was less harmful to health than the old gilding process using mercury.",
