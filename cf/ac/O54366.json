Redated to 1948 by Daw San San Maw; Ministry Archaeology, Rangoon, 1994\n\nAttribution note: Kengtung is noted for producing this type of gilded container. It is in the shape of a pyi-daung (rice basket) as originally these receptacles were baskets with carrying straps and is called ko kaw tee in the Shan language. The tribal figures represent those from Kengtung state but still need identification.\nThe figures which are moulded in the round are of master quality in comparison to the low relief decoration which is mediocre.\nEmbellishments were added post 1885 and into the 20th century to attract Burmen and European buyers:-\na) High relief of the figures.\nb) Signatures\nFurther information from Ralph Isaacs; March 2001",
