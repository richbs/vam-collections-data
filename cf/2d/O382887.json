Sk\u00e5ne province, in the extreme south of Sweden, has the richest tradition, and more jewellery was worn there than in any other district.   Almost all the Swedish traditional jewellery at the V&A comes from Sk\u00e5ne.  \n\nA well-dressed woman from Sk\u00e5ne wore multiple pairs of silver clasps along the front edges of her outer clothes.  Some of these were functional, and hooked into each other.  Others were only ornamental.  These appliqu\u00e9s are purely decorative, but their design, with a change in pattern along the inside edge, shows that they are derived from a pair of bodice clasps.  They have the marks of Hans Fick, a silversmith who worked in Kristianstad from 1797 to 1822.  This kind of jewellery made from stamped sheet silver is typical of Kristianstad, which was one of the main centres for traditional jewellery in Sk\u00e5ne in the 18th and 19th centuries.",
