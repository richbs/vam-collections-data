Knox studied at the Douglas School of Art, specialising in Celtic art, and began his teaching career there. He arrived in London in the mid-1890s, and designed for the pioneering retailer Liberty & Co. from about 1899. Knox became one of  the ablest of the Liberty designers, displaying an easy mastery of the intricate interlacing ornament in the Celtic manner, as this cake basket demonstrates. It was made in pewter by the Birmingham firm of  W.H. Haseler, who had already formed a working relationship with Liberty's to make most of their silver  'Cymric' range.\n\nTime\nPewter, a tin alloy,  had been  largely out of favour in Britain since the 18th century as a material for making fashionable tableware, but a revival of interest in the material had begun in France and Germany at the end of the 19th century. Arthur Lasenby Liberty (1843-1917), who founded Liberty & Co., began to import modern pewter from Germany in 1899. The success of this venture encouraged him to commission the 'Tudric' range, of which this cake basket is an example, using designs from Rex Silver and Archibald Knox.",
