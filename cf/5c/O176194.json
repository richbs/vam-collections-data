This was removed when the mural paintings by Antonio Verrio were found underneath in 1899. An Italian brocade of this design is in the Department of Textiles, VAM, no 715-1864. A derivative pattern is E.2234-1966. A reproduction based on this design, entitled 'The Earl of Onslow', was produced by Arthur Sanderson & Sons Ltd in 1907.
