The first one, Star Wars: A New Hope (1977) became the most successful film in history and grossed over $290 million.  It was not only the film that became a success but also the mechandising that was produced along side the film. The films captured the public's imagination and paved the way for the merchandising that accompanies many films today. A whole host of toy figures, spacecrafts and vehicles were available, as well as costumes, stationery, bedroom accessories and slippers.\n\nThis toy vehicle is a X-Wing Fighter from the Star Wars films.  It was flown by Luke Skywalker.  It was produced by Hasbro under the Kenner name after it took over the company in 1991.  As the toys had sold so well after the first films it was decided to re-release a new range which was known as Power of the Force 2.",
