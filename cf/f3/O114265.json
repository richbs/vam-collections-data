Ferrari's book, 'Hesperides', first published in Rome in 1646. This was a publication describing the varieties of citrus fruit then in cultivation, with engraved illustrations of the fruit as well as views of gardens and of equipment for cultivating the trees. The third drawing, which is somewhat inferior, is by another unidentified artist, and is not reproduced in Ferrari's book. All three drawings originally formed part of the collection assembled by the great 17th-century antiquary and natural scientist Cassiano dal Pozzo. This collection of drawings is known as the 'Museo Cartaceo' or 'Paper Museum'. The majority of the collection passed in the British Royal Collections, where it remains, but in the 18th century several volume sof the drawings were sold and dispersed through the London art market. The V&A purchased these three drawings in 1949, along with 7 other drawings of citrus fruits and two botanical drawings, all originally from Cassiano's collection.
