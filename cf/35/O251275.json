This process takes place with each separate colour, which is slowly dried before another is applied. The consequence is that in the finished paper there is a considerable mass of solid colour. / \nMACHINE-PRINTED PAPERS are produced at a great speed, all the colours being printed at one time and rapidly dried in a heated gallery. In consequence of the speed at which they are printed, there is merely a film of colour deposited on the surface of the paper. / \nFOR PERMANENT USE we strongly recommend the hand-printed paper. / \n\nThe machine-printed papers are placed at the end of one of the books or in a msall book by themselves. / \n\nShow Rooms: / \n449, Oxford Street, London, W.'",

This example is big enough to show a full repeat of all but the very largest patterns. 'Table books', which could be loand out, were rather smaller. The book includes a small selection of machine-printed papers, though the introduction stresses their inadequacies in comparison to the hand-block printed versions.'\nParry, Linda, ed. <u>William Morris</u> London : Philip Wilson in association with the Victoria and Albert Museum, 1996. Published to coincide with an exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum, 9 May-1 Sept. 1996.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n'<b>L.18</b> <i>St. James\u2019s</i> wallpaper \n\n<b>a</b> Original design \nWilliam Morris, 23 July 1880 \nMonochrome version, pencil and sepia, \n190.5 x 69.0 cm \nInscribed \nWilliam Morris Gallery \n(London Borough of Waltham Forest) (A40a) \n\n<b>b</b> Wallpaper sample, <i>St James\u2019s, 126</i> \nDesigned by William Morris, first issued 1881 \nPrinted by Jeffrey & Co. for Morris & Co. \nBlock-printed in distemper colours and silver and gold, 68.0 x 52.0 cm \nV&A (E.528-1919) \nGiven by Morris & Co. \n\nOn 16 July 1880, Morris met representatives of the Board of Works concerning the redecoration of the Visitor\u2019s Entrance, the Grand Staircase, the Garden Entrance and the Ambassadors\u2019 Entrance at St James\u2019s Palace (see also cat.no.I.13). \n\nThe firm\u2019s proposal for the Grand Staircase (PRO Work 19/20) was that \u2018The lower stage \u2026 would have the walls covered with embossed and gilded paper, very think, the upper stage and gallery would have the walls also covered with paper of different design and flat varnished \u2026\u2019 The latter was the specially designed <i>St James\u2019s</i> pattern on which Morris immediately started work. A scheme for the decorations, including a fully worked and coloured design for the paper (held at the William Morris Gallery, Walthamstow) was submitted to the Board of Works on 24 October 1880 and approved by the Queen on 2 November. \n\nThis design shows a great deal of working, particularly on the central motif; the upright stem meander. In his <i>c</i>.1879 lecture \u2018Making the Best Of It\u2019, Morris said \u2018\u2026 no amount of delicacy is too great in drawing the curves of a pattern, no amount of care in getting the leading lines right from the first, can be thrown away, for beauty of detail cannot afterwards cure any shortcomings in this\u2019 \n\nAs befitting the grandeur and size of the space, the <i>St James\u2019s</i> is very large. The formality of the treatment of the acanthus leaves and flowerheads in the foreground is, however, relieved by the more domestic handling of the roses, leaves and small flowers in the underlay. Two widths of paper are needed to complete the pattern horizontally, while the vertical repeat of 119.4 cm requires two blocks to print each colour. Sixty-eight blocks are needed to complete the pattern. The cutting and printing must have been a gigantic task, carried out at speed. Only four months separated the approval of the plan and its completion. The blocks were destroyed in a fire at Jeffrey\u2019s on 22 November 1881. The printing for the Palace was complete by this time but the blocks were recut for future use. \n\nThis colouring was used for the Queen\u2019s Staircase, the Grand Staircase (fig.88) \u2013 where it was used in conjunction with an imitation leather paper, <i>Peacocks and Amorini</i>, designed by Walter Crane and issued by Jeffrey & Co. \u2013 and the Ambassador\u2019s Staircase where it was teamed with another Jeffrey\u2019s \u2018leather\u2019, the <i>Cupid</i>, designed by Bruce Talbert. \n\nThe successful completion of the decoration of the entrances was followed by a commission for the main suite of State Apartments, including the Banqueting or waterloo Room. This was hung with a red re-colouring of the <i>St James\u2019s</i>, varnished as on the staircases. \n\nBoth colourings were included in Morris & Co.\u2019s stock range, priced at 32s. 6d. a roll.'\nParry, Linda, ed. <u>William Morris</u> London : Philip Wilson in association with the Victoria and Albert Museum, 1996.
