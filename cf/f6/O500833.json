The following is the full text of the entry: CARRACCI, ANNIBALE (1560-1609) 648 A semi-nude boy reclining and playing upon a pipe, with the heads of two other boys to left and right Inscribed indistinctly in black chalk 'A Carac ... ' Red chalk 6 1/8 x 8 1/8 (155 x 206) Dyce 272 PROVENANCE N. Hone (Lugt 2793); Sir J. Reynolds (Lugt 2364); Dyce Bequest 1869 LITERATURE Dyce Catalogue no. 272 (as by Correggio); M. Jaff\u00e9, 'Annibale and Lodovico Carracci: notes on drawings' in The Burlington Magazine, 102, 1960, pp. 27-31 and fig. 39 A piece of paper about 2 1/2 ins. square has been cut away from the upper left corner and replaced by a patch. The drawing, formerly ascribed to Correggio, was attributed to Annibale by Bodmer, according to a note in the departmental register. It is possibly a preliminary study for one of the angel musicians in 'The Baptism of Christ' in the church of S. Gregorio, Bologna, dated 1585 (pi. 58 in the Catalogue of the Carracci Exhibition at Bologna, September-October 1956). The piping boy in the drawing bears a certain resemblance to the angel on the extreme right of the painting, though his head and shoulders are turned towards the front of the picture rather than inwards. Stylistically, anyhow, the drawing dates from about the same time as the painting and illustrates Correggio's influence on the young Annibale.",
