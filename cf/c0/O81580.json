In spite of progressively emerging as the leader of the Barbizon school, Rousseau was systematically excluded from the Paris Salon between 1836 and 1841. Between the revolution of 1848 and the early 1860s, Rousseau enjoyed a short period of prosperity with official commissions and was eventually made Officer of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur in 1867, a few months before he died.\n\nThis painting is a fine example of Rousseau's early painted sketches and was probably made when he was still a teenager. It depicts the bridge of Batignies, crossing over the small stream le Ru de Berne in the forest of Compi\u00e8gne (North-Est of Paris). This painting anticipates Rousseau's interest for an objective rendering of nature and already shows his personal manner characterised by a free and broad brushwork, which would become the hallmark of his art and eventually of the Barbizon school.",

He began painting from nature during excursions in the environs of Paris, including Fontainebleau, from 1826 to 1829. From 1831 to 1836 he exhibited at the Salon, but the naturalism of his landscapes made him the most controversial figure of his time and the consistent refusal of the Salon to accept any of his work between 1837 and 1848 earned him the title of <i>Le Grand Refuse</i>. From about 1837 he went to Barbizon nearly every year and became the central figure of the group of painters associated with that place, but public recognition came only with the Revolution of 1848 and the first class medal awarded by the free jury of the 1849 Salon. \n\nLit.

Recently, however, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Toussaint of the Louvre (written communication) has convincingly identified it with an early work by Rousseau entitled <i>Pont de Batignies</i>, exhibited in 1867. The size given in the catalogue (22 x 31 cm.) fits exactly and Mlle Toussaint was able to confirm her identification with reference to an engraving of the Pont de Batignies, now destroyed. The date given in the catalogue is 1828, when Rousseau was 14 or 15. (Cf. <i>Le T\u00e9l\u00e9graphe de Montmartre</i>, at Boulogne, exh. <i>Rousseau</i>, Louvre, 1967-68, no. I). \n\nProv.

He bequeathed the painting to the Museum in 1900.\n\nHistorical significance: This painting is a fine example of Rousseau's early manner. It has been identified with one of the work exhibited in the Cercle des Arts, Paris, 1867, organised by Hector-Henri-Cl\u00e9ment Brame and Paul Durand-Ruel a year after they convinced Rousseau to sell them 70 sketches with which he had always refused to part. \nThe date that appears in the 1867 exhibition catalogue was, according to H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Toussaint from the Louvre (written communication, Feb. 1973), randomly chosen and the monogram 'TH.R' was added on this occasion. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Toussaint also compared CAI.56 with other two compositions: the early <i> Telegraph Tower on Montmartre</i> (c. 1826 - Mus\u00e9e municipal, Boulogne), one of Rousseau's first painted studies, and <i>Pierrefonds dans la for\u00eat de Compi\u00e8gne</i>, Private collection. Should this sketch be executed at roughly the same time as the <i>T\u00e9l\u00e9graphe de Montmartre</i>, we can then assume that it was made when Rousseau was still a teenager c. 1826.\nThe subject matter was identified as the bridge of Batignies in the forest of Compi\u00e8gne and the composition was very likely made after the motif in plein-air. At that time, Rousseau was regularly taken by his cousin, the landscape painter Alexandre Pau de Saint-Martin (1782-1850) to work in the forest of Compi\u00e8gne before he entered the studio of Joseph R\u00e9mond in c. 1826.",

            "historical_context_note": "19th-century French art is marked by a succession of movements based on a more or less close relationship with nature. At the beginning of the century, Romantic artists were fascinated by nature they interpreted as a mirror of the mind. They investigated human nature and personality, the folk culture, the national and ethnic origins, the medieval era, the exotic, the remote, the mysterious and the occult. This movement was heralded in France by such painter as Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix (1798-1863). In its opposition to academic art and its demand for a modern style Realism continued the aims of the Romantics. They assumed that reality could be perceived without distortion or idealization, and sought after a mean to combine the perception of the individual with objectivity. This reaction in French painting against the Grand Manner is well represented by Gustave Courbet (1819-1877) who wrote a 'Manifesto of Realism', entitled <i>Le R\u00e9alisme</i> published in Paris in 1855. These ideas were challenged by the group of the Barbizon painters, who formed a recognizable school from the early 1830s to the 1870s and developed a free, broad and rough technique. They were mainly concerned by landscape painting and the rendering of light. The works of Narcisse Virgile Diaz de la Pe\u00f1a (1807-1876), Jules Dupr\u00e9 (1811-1889), Th\u00e9odore Rousseau (1812-1867), Constant Troyon (1810-1865) and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet (1814-1875) anticipate somehow  the <i>plein-air</i> landscapes of the Impressionists.",
