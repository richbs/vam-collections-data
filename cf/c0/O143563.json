It was taken with a paper negative process invented by William Henry Fox Talbot during the late 1830s. There is a deep foreground of clearly defined stones and water-sculpted mud which dominates the view of docked ships and a harbour town. The photographer, Calvert Jones, was introduced to the process by a cousin of Talbot and by close friends who lived near to Jones in South Wales.\n\nJones' work stands out in the development of early photography because of his ability to fuse his new skill in photography with the influence of his early training in as a watercolorist. Originally a rich purple-brown print, the deep foreground of tide-sculpted mud and clearly-defined stones contrasts with the sweep of the panorama across the bay from the dock-side ships and town to the edge of the harbour wall. The 'double-view' was a technique of particular interest to Jones, who subsequently devised a method of using a binocular camera to produce a wide view on an unjoined single sheet of paper.",

Subsequently, Jones became one of the few Britons to produced a substantial body of calotypes in Britain and abroad. His work stands out in the early development of photography because of his ability to fuse his technical skill with the influence of his training as a watercolorist.\n\nThis photograph is the right side of a two-part panorama. Unusually, each image is in landscape format creating a wide sweep of the whole harbour when the two parts are put together. The colour of the retouching indicates that the original colour was a deep purple-brown with a dark foreground of tide-sculpted mud and stones. Jones began to experiment with two and three part panoramas in 1846, he referred to them as 'joiners' and 'double views'.",
