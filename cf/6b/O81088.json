The basic form of knives and forks had also become standardised by this date.\n\nDesign\nBy the mid-18th century, table knives and forks were usually made in sets and decorated to match the rest of the cutlery.  By the end of the 18th century the standard pistol-shaped haft (handle) gave way to straighter, flat-ended hafts. Forks generally had smaller hafts. The knife blade is usually of sabre, or scimitar, shape. The steel blades and shanks have a 'tang' or rod at the base that fits into the hollow handle, which is then packed with resin. The junction between haft and blade is fitted with a small metal collar, or 'ferrule'.\n\nMaterials & Making\nA wide range of materials have been employed as hafts since the early 17th century. Ivory remained popular into the 19th century. This example is additionally decorated with inlaid silver wire.",
