            "public_access_description": "Object Type\nTea canisters, sometimes called caddies today, were containers for storing tea leaves. They often have a lock, as tea was initially an expensive luxury. A gradual fall in price allowed tea to be drunk more widely during the 18th century especially after import duties were cut in 1784. Tea was prepared by the lady of the house in front of family and guests in the drawing room, not in the kitchen. Taking tea was an important form of entertainment in society and this was reflected in the elegance and richness of the tea utensils. Canisters are therefore often highly decorative.\n\nDesign & Cost\nThe simple cube form of this tea canister is based on the wooden chests in which the tea was imported from China. This shape was known as a tea tub in the 18th century. A certain Charles Kent purchased a square tea tub from the goldsmith Parker & Wakelin for \u00a37 7s 5d in 1772.\n\nMaterials & Making\nAlthough the tea canister was hall-marked and probably sold through the shop of the goldsmiths George Cowles (died 1811) & Louisa Courtauld, it may have been put together by a number of independent specialists. The tea canister bodies, made from silver sheet seamed at the side, could have been supplied by one maker, who then passed the object to another to add a lock and liner and on to a third for engraved decoration. This was the usual method of manufacture in the silver trade at the time.",
