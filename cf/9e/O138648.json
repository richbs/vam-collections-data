The practice was taken up in England, and become sufficently widespread to encourage printers to produce pattern sheets with borders, swags, ribbons and bows which were designed to be cut out and used to frame and embellish the prints on the walls. There was a revival of interest in creating Print Rooms - especially in historic buildings - the 1980s and 1990s and these borders were probably produced for this purpose.",
