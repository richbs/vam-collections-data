His interest in art and design was aroused by a visit to the Great Exhibition of 1851 and he later became involved in the decoration of the Victoria and Albert Museum; he is depicted in a relief panel on the pediment of the Museum's Lecture Theatre. At the end of 1864, he was appointed Architectural Sculptor, one of three new posts for artist-craftsmen at the Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy School of Art and Industry in Bombay. This undated picture depicts an Englishman inspecting samples of cotton in a godown or warehouse in Salkhia, Bengal. The view is taken through a curved arch and shows the Englishman in the centre, wearing a topi, inspecting a piece of cotton, which a merchant is showing him. His servant stands by holding a fan and an umbrella, with a bulldog at his feet eyeing another dog, which is just outside the archway. The warehouse is full of stacked-up bales of cotton.",
