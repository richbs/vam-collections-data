She supports the Christ-child, also dressed in loose robes, on her left knee with her left hand on His left shoulder. The sculpture was originally completely gilded and there are considerable remains of the gilding still visible where the later overpainting has been rubbed away. There is a channel inside the bench and is it possible that the state was originally made to contain a relic. \n\nThe statue dates from the thirteenth century and owes a stylistic debt to French sculpture which influenced work across Northern Europe.",
