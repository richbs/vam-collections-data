In front of the tree stands a dancer on point, her weight on her right foot, her left foot extended to the back. Her body is turned in profile to her left but her head is turned to look at the viewer; her left arm is curved above her head and her left arm bent with the hand at breast height; in her hands are castanets.  Her severely dressed hair is caught in pink ribbons at the back.  Her off-the shoulder brown bodice is laced down the front; over the puffed white sleeves are brown lappets and similar lappets are visible over the skirt.  The knee-length diaphanous skirt is trimmed at the hem with brown and yellow flowers and a narrow matching ribbon.  On the ground are flower sprays and posies. The print area is cut across upper corners",

In 1838 she appeared in La Gitana (The Gipsy), a typical Romantic ballet story of a child stolen from her aristocratic parents and brought up as a gipsy before being restored to her family.  The print shows her in the moonlit forest scene, where she performs a Spanish dance. This was a direct challenge to her great rival, Fanny Elssler, whose particular forte was the wild, exotic Spanish Cachucha.  Taglioni's solo was rapturously received by her audiences.  \nThe only indications that the dance is Spanish are the castanets in Taglioni's hands.  She wears what had, by 1840, become a recognisable 'ballet' costume - a low-cut pointed bodice, or a little blouse worn under a laced bodice, and a bell-shaped, knee-length skirt formed of tiers of tarlatan with a diaphanous top layer.",

Eventually numbering 145 items, some of which had belonged to the ballerina Anna Pavlova, it was one of the first and most important specialist collections in private hands.  \nRambert bought the first print as a wedding present but could not bear to give it away.  As the collection grew, it was displayed in the bar of the Mercury Theatre, the headquarters of Ballet Rambert, but in 1968, Rambert gave the collection to the Victoria and Albert Museum; seven duplicates were returned to Rambert, but these are catalogued in Ivor Guest's A Gallery of Romantic Ballet, which was published before the collection came to the V&A.  Although often referred to as a collection of Romantic Ballet prints, there are also important engravings of 17th and 18th century performers, as well as lithographs from the later 19th century, by which time the great days of the ballet in London and Paris were over.",

Lithography, with its soft quality, enhanced by the delicate yet rich hand-colouring, was ideally suited to the subject - the ballerinas who dominated ballet in the mid-century and the romanticised settings in which they performed; style and subject were perfectly matched. The lithographs produced in London are notable for capturing the personality and style of individual performers in a theatrical setting.  They are a fitting tribute to one of ballet's richest periods. \nBefore the development of colour printing, the basic black and white prints were hand coloured.  There is often considerable variation from one print to another, both in colour and quality of the work.  The most important souvenir prints, such as this one, would only have been sent out to the best colourists, and it is often very difficult to tell the best hand colouring from early colour printing.  In the days before photography, such lithographs were expensive souvenirs, bought by the individual dancer's admirers.",
