Pieced: section added down right hand side but there are marked differences in the colours of the embroidery across the seam - perhaps it was added to widen the panel as fashions changed?\nPart of the embroidery at the top has been cut through.  The left hand edge has been trimmed and is irregular.  There is a border along the bottom: triangular base with 3 small flowers in blue and green alternating with a pink flower.  There is a narrow border of small pink motifs above and below this and part way up both sides.\n\nThe main pattern is a series of diagonal lines from lower right to upper left. These are chevron lines in green and yellow.\nThere are two sizes of stripes:\n[1] narrow stripes: white ground with a group of small purple blossoms on a chevron stem alternating with a small pink blossom on a chevron stem; there are small round pink and green buds.\n[2] wider stripes in two designs: [a] blue ground with a straight striped stem, 3 pink flowers and 3 sprays of small white blossoms alternating with angled stems with 3 large pink blossoms;\n[b] green ground with black edged vase with a pair of pink leaves, a large round pink flower and 3 blue and white leaves alternating with a light blue edged vase with an arrangement of 4 pink and 3 purple flowers.\nThreads: Silk, 2S: black, purple, light green, blue, red, pink, white, light purple, green, yellow, light blue.",
