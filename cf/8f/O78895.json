This example is made of partridgewood, a hard red wood with darker parallel stripes, which was much used in cabinet-making. It came from the West Indies. The knob is of tiger's eye, a yellowish brown quartz with a brilliant lustre used as a gem. This gives the stick a very elegant appearance.\n\nTrading\nIndustrialisation and mass manufacturing in the 19th century meant that walking sticks were produced in large quantities.  Millions of canes were imported from the Far East and shops that specialised in walking sticks and umbrellas flourished.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe knobs and handles of walking sticks were made of a wide range of materials, from silver and ivory to porcelain and quartz. They were often carved or cast in the form of animals, birds, skulls and even naked women. The shafts were often made from malacca, although glass, hippopotamus, horn and snakeskin were sometimes used.\n\nTime\nAfter about 1920 the walking stick began to disappear as a fashion accessory.  It was largely replaced by the umbrella.  Today walking sticks are primarily regarded as orthopaedic aids and supports for the elderly.",
