Italian goldsmiths were expert at making a little material go a very long way.  Many pieces seem too large to wear comfortably, but they are usually made of very thin metal, and are much lighter than they appear.  This necklace is made from hollow gold beads, as thin as paper.\n\nMost Italian traditional necklaces are made of beads, in designs which have been worn for centuries.  They were usually strung on red cord, which probably had an amuletic function.  The cord of this necklace was originally dyed red, but the colour only survives in patches, where it has been protected by the beads.\n\nIt was bought as part of the Castellani collection of Italian Peasant Jewellery at the International Exhibition, Paris, 1867.",
