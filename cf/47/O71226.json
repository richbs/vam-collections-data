Britain was importing approximately 3,000,000 lbs of coffee beans per annum around the time this pot was made. About two-thirds of this came from plantations in the West Indies, the remainder from Arabia.\n\nDesign & Designing\nSimilar coffee pots were made at the Niderviller fa\u00efence factory in Lorraine on the edge of eastern France. Both the Bow and Niderviller pieces were possibly copied from an original made at the Italian Doccia porcelain factory near Florence. The design of the spout and other parts are similar to Doccia pots, and a Doccia tea and chocolate service is known to have been among the stock owned by one of the Bow factory partners in 1764. Only one other Bow coffee pot of this shape is known today, possibly because the spouts on pots of this sort are all too easily broken.\n\nMaterials & Making\nThe Bow factory made a type of porcelain that was strengthened with bone ash, making it suitable for tea- and tablewares. Although Bow concentrated on utilitarian wares, it also made a range of luxury pieces, for example this coffee pot.",

ISBN 1851773088.\nThis fanciful design is especially intriguing for the puzzle of its sources. The spout and handle recall coffeepots made at the Italian porcelain factory of Doccia in the middle of the eighteenth century; a Doccia service is in fact recorded at the sale of the Bow warehouse in May 1764, when it was described as \"a rich and elegant Tea and Chocolate Equipage, of the curious and rare Tuscan Manufactory. . . .\" Although Rococo shellwork is common in Doccia porcelain, all known Doccia pots lack both the scrolled upturned cover (a shape rarely found on ceramic coffeepots), and the Rococo scrollwork and cartouches that enliven the body. Similar Rococo scrollwork occurs in mid-eighteenth-century silversmiths' work, in which zoomorphic spouts and high-looped handles are found. (The latter two features are particularly common on Italian silver coffeepots of the 1750s and 1760s.) As Italian silver was clearly an important influence on the design of the lobed Doccia coffeepots of the 1750s, it may be that the Bow design derives from a silver prototype by way of a Doccia adaptation. The scrolled base, however, occurs on other Bow productions of the early 1760s, on occasions in combination with the same mark-\"To\"-impressed on the foot of this piece. The significance of this mark has been the subject of a great deal of speculation, but is thought to be that of a craftsman who worked as a modeller and a \"repairer\" (the workman who assembled the objects from piece-moulds prior to firing), and who worked at a number of porcelain factories.\nThis relatively recent acquisition was made in part so that the English porcelain collection would include an unusually exuberant form of Rococo, of a type that the Museum had only begun to collect in other materials with the purchase of the Ashburnham Centrepiece (cat. 147). The Bow coffeepot was also seen as a way of linking the British and Continental collections. With its looped handle and body overrun by wildly asymmetrical scrollwork, the pot takes a Rococo theme to an extreme rare in English porcelain.\n\nLit. Tait, 1963, p. 209\n\nHILARY YOUNG",
