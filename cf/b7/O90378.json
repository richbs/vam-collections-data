They were not necessarily used to extinguish a candle\u2019s flame. The point at the end was for retrieving the tip of the wick if it fell into molten wax. They are first recorded in the 15th century. Numerous patents for snuffers are known from the middle of the 18th century, regularly reappearing with new improvements until 1840, when candles that completely consumed their wicks were first developed, rendering snuffers superfluous.\n\nSnuffers often appeared with a tray upon which to rest the snuffer. Such trays were variously shaped and decorated. They might have four feet or a vertical rim, and they might be decorated with reeding, pierced work, moulded borders or relief masks. Later examples in both silver and Sheffield plate might be oval, canoe shaped or hourglass shaped. After around 1770 the handle disappeared from such trays and they are frequently indistinguishable from the so-called \u2018pen tray\u2019. The present example is oblong, contracting towards the middle, with a moulded border with scroll corners, four claw-and-ball feet and a foliated scroll handle.\n\nSheffield plate originated with the discovery in 1742 by a cutler from Sheffield, Thomas Boulsover (1704-1788), that bars of silver and copper in unequal proportions, fused by heating under pressure, could be rolled into sheets of laminated metal and worked like silver. The industry this material created flourished for approximately a hundred years until Sheffield plate was superseded by electroplating in the 1840s.",
