At each end a rectangular terminal plate, decorated with two pastes either side of a plain dome, is attached to the final rod by four loops.  One terminal has two red pastes, and the other, one green and one black.  The terminal plates are fastened together, to close the bracelet, by a pin made from a doubled length of wire, which is prevented from falling out by a bar inside the last loop.",

Tribal peoples, such as the Bedouin, usually wore stiff circular or penannular bracelets.  Flexible bracelets, like this one, were commoner among urban women.  \n\nThis pattern, with hollow domes forming a kind of flexible chain, was popular throughout the Syrian region.  Bracelets where the domes are linked by stiff rods, as here, were a speciality of Palestine.  This example was acquired as an example of typical Syrian traditional jewellery, for five shillings and sixpence the pair, at the International Exhibition, London, 1872, when its name was recorded as \u2018shalmi hirluch\u2019.",
