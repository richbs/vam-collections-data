Its extreme curve linearity relates to the free carving that stack lamination and fibreglass afforded him in the 1960s. The objects surface reflects a perfectionism and historical resonance (referring to the use of gold leaf in Japanese lacquer).\nFrom a technical point of view the object bears more resemblance materially to a custom car than a piece of wooden furniture. (Wendell Castle has great interest in automobiles and collects antique examples.) The from revisits the general profile of Verner Panton's celebrated one-piece plastic moulded chair.\nThe object is also an example showing Castle participating actively in the current marketplace phenomenon of 'design art', in which pieces of furniture are given an extraordinarily high degree of finish.",
