The 1960s black and white paper with a paisley-patterned design of  topless female figures - a washable vinyl paper - was originally hung in the bathroom of the house. The red and white embossed Sanderson paper with vignettes of contemporary bowls and vases is in a very distinctive 1950s style. The other two samples - a bold floral on a black ground and a sketchy figurative design of statues in a park setting (Sanderson, designed by Quaintance New York; possibly titled 'Loire') represent distinctive 50s decorative styles. All the papers are welcome additions to the collection, but the vinyl paper, with its 'Swinging Sixties' ambiance especially so.",
