On her head she carries a container intended to be a basket or a wooden pail made of vertical slats.  On the centre of its interior is the inscription W M/ 1691.  All the decoration is in blue.\nBody colour: Buff.\nGlaze: White.  The interior of the skirt is glazed and the rim of the base has been wiped clean of glaze.\nShape: The side of the container opposite the woman's raised arm seems to have had a vertical projection, now broken off, which may have served as a lug for a lid.  The skirt is hollow.  (Alphabetic shape codes as used in appendix to Archer. <font -u>Delftware</font>. 1997)",

Although there are no other comparable examples in existence, its use as a decorative container for sweetmeats on the dining table - with a secondary role as a mantlepiece ornament - seems entirely plausible.\n\nTime\nImages of 17th-century city street traders, edging their way through bustling narrow street with a basket or milk-pail on their head, are almost unknown. In the case of this inscribed and dated tin-glazed earthenware figure, the simple fact that it was made of humble materials for presentation to somebody of a similar rank has ensured its survival as an heirloom. This in turn has preserved for us a fleeting glimpse of street life in the last decade of the 17th century.",
