            "bibliography": "<i>Catalogue of British Oil Paintings 1820-1860</i>, Ronald Parkinson, Victoria and Albert Museum, London: HMSO, 1990, pp. 159-60\nThe following is the full text of the entry:\n\n\"LESLIE, Charles Robert, RA (1794-1859) \nBorn London 19 October 1794, eldest son of American parents, with whom he went to Philadelphia 1799. Apprenticed to a publisher 1808, received a few lessons in painting from Thomas Sully. A subscription was raised to enable him to study art in Europe; returned to London 1811, entered RA Schools and studied with Benjamin West and Washington Allston. Visited Paris 1817 with Allston and Wilkie Collins, met G S Newton, with whom he visited Brussels and Antwerp. Also friend and biographer (published 1843) of John Constable. Exhibited 76 works at the RA between 1813 and 1859, and 11 at the BI 1815-32. Some were portraits, but most were his much admired literary subjects, particularly drawn from Cervantes, Moliere, Shakespeare and Sterne. Elected ARA 1821, RA 1826. Several of his works were engraved, and he made six illustrations for Sir Walter Scott's Waverley novels 1824. Worked for six months as drawing master at West Point Military Academy, New York State, 1833. Professor of Painting at RA 1848-52; his lectures were published as a Handbook for Young Painters (1855). His Life of Reynolds was finished by Tom Taylor and published 1865. Died St John's Wood, London, 5 May 1859. An exhibition at the RA of 30 of his works was held winter 1870. His two sons, George Dunlop and Robert, were also artists. The Athenaeum critic (9 May 1846, p480) wrote that he was 'unrivalled for the certainty of his powers, the wit of his pencil, the deep knowledge of human nature as exhibited in the more ordinary scenes of life'. \nLIT: \tArt Journal 1856, pp73-5 and 105-7,1859, p187 (obit); C R Leslie Autobiographical Recollections ed T Taylor, 2 vols,'1860; J Dafforne Pictures by C R Leslie nd (1875]; Art Journal 1902 pp144-8; J Constable The Letters of John Constable and C R  Leslie 1931; ed R B Beckett John Constable's Correspondence III, Ipswich 1965 \n\n\n'Who Can This Be?' FA111 Neg 55168 \nCanvas, 58.3 X 73.6 cm (23 X 29 ins) Sheepshanks Gift 1857 \nExhibited at the RA in 1839, a pendant to 'Whom Can This Be From?' (see FA112 p158), and according to Taylor (Leslie II, p251) painted for John Sheepshanks. \nThe critic of the Examiner thought it: \nA very clever painting, which abounds in this artist's best qualities, and exhibits in a less than usual degree his defects. It represents a gay, \n\taudacious, and evidently unknown gallant, accosting a burly middle-\naged man, on whose arm leans a young maiden. For the sake of which of \nthe twain this unceremonious attempt at the establishment of an \nacquaintance is made, the spectator cannot doubt. The perplexed, \nearnest, more than half suspicious stare of the keen, glistening, almost \nfierce black eyes of the protector of the damsel; the hesitating, startled \nmanner of his return to the profound salutation of the stranger; and his \ngeneral expression and attitude of blended composure and effort at \nself-possession, are exceedingly whimsical and effectively delineated. \nThe youth and the maiden are also very cleverly represented; but, of \ncourse, are not susceptible of an equal degree of comic character. The \ntaint of Mr Leslie's usual style of colouring is this picture's sole defect; but \nfortunately, is not sufficiently prominent to be productive of any material \ninjury to it. \nBut the Athenaeum seems to have disliked both the subject and the treatment: \nMr Leslie has four cabinet pictures in the great room. Two of these [that is, the present work, and 'Whom Can This Be From?', FA112, p160] belong to the class of pretty insipidities, being devoted to love passages slily maintained between gentlemen and ladies, tricked out in stage magnificence, neither party the least in earnest, or in the least resembling personages of any age, court, or country whatsoever. We might lament as we asked, where is Mr Leslie's racy humour? where his feeling for the beauty of youth, and health, and cheerfulness? ... we are sorry to observe, that Mr Leslie's scarlet fancy in flesh-colouring is rather on the increase: let him carry it a little further, and the critic must needs talk of the geraniums, not the roses, on the cheeks of his maidens. \nThe Art Union also criticised the colouring, but praised the artist's patron: \nA work of the highest merit in design; if he could colour as he conceives, he would be unrivalled in his age. A fair young dame of the olden time is leaning on the arm of an 'approved good senior', to whom a gallant approaches and bows low. That he is the admirer, perchance the lover, of the gentle maiden, who can doubt? This picture and its 'companion' are the property of a gentleman - at once liberal and unobtrusive - who, in a quiet nook at Blackheath, has collected some of the rarest treasures of British art, and who has done more, in his own gentle and generous manner, to advance its true interest than half the magnates of the land; a gentleman whose name every lover of art, except himself, delights to hear mentioned, and whose retiring habits unfortunately prevent the advantages that might arise from the influence of his example. These pictures of Leslie are worthy to be added to the choicest, if not the most extensive, collection in the kingdom. The artists labour for him con amore; so highly is he esteemed, that he is sure to possess their best works. \nFor a fuller discussion of the subject of the work, see FA112, below \nEXH: \tRA 1839 (57); Victorian Narrative Paintings V&A circulating exhibition 1961 \nLIT: \tAthenaeum 25 May 1839, p396; Examiner 1839, p359; Art Union 1839, p67, 1856, p74; Leslie I, plxxiv, II, p251 \nREPR: M H Bulley Art and Counterfeit 1925, fig 169 \n\nR Parkinson\"",
