It was part of a large transfer of 4990 objects from the British Museum to the V&A. The transfer paperwork reads \"This transfer of photographs is part of the British Museum's plans to rationalise the collection and house objects at the V&A where greater expertise and national collections of particular media reside.\"  (Provenance information provided by The Prints and Drawings Department at the British Museum.)",
