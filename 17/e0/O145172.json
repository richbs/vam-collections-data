This scene from The Beggar's Opera is taken from a painting by Canadian artist Gilbert Stuart Newton (1794-1835), who made his career in Britain. Theatrical paintings might be portraits of famous actors in their well known roles, but, as here, they could be artistic imaginings of characters placed in realistic settings. The engraving shows the highwayman, Captain Macheath, in a very solid Newgate prison, sitting between Polly and Lucy, who are rivals for his love. The scene and characters were easily recognisable. John Gay's ballad opera is regarded as the most successful dramatic work of the 18th century. On its opening in 1728 it ran for 62 consecutive performances, a record for the time, and it has been a favourite with audiences ever since.",
