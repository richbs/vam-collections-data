It shows Joshua, the leader of the Israelites who succeeded Moses and  led them in the conquest of Canaan, the Promised Land. The panel  may originally have decorated the screen or gallery of a church or private house. It  is typical of the plainer style of church decoration that prevailed after the Reformation from about 1540 onwards. Narrative scenes with Old Testament figures in contemporary dress replaced saints in classical robes. The surface was no longer embellished with rich gilding and intricate two-dimensional patterns. The purpose of such panels was didactic rather than devotional. Simple images, large text and the use of English rather than Latin made the stories accessible to a wide range of people, many of whom were neither well-educated nor literate. .\n\nPlace\nThe panels almost certainly come from the south-west of England. The figures are similar to those on a painted ceiling at Muchelney Abbey and in plasterwork at Montacute House, both in Somerset. The lettering is similar to inscriptions on walls of the Dorset churches of  Puddletown and Cerne Abbas. The panels were purchased in 1914 from a dealer from Lynmouth, Devon, by the name of T. Charbonnier. There was a strong tradition in south-western England in the early 17th century of portraying figures of this kind with associated texts in plasterwork. This panel, one of a group of 25 in the V&A, is a rare surviving example of the tradition executed in paint on panel.\n\nTime\nFrom about 1590 stories from the Old Testament supplied popular decorative themes in domestic and church settings in the West Country. Examples include Prideaux Place (1590s -1630s) and Lanydrock (1630s), Cornwall, and the parish church of Widecombe in the Moor, Devon.",
