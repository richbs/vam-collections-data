It is made of ormolu: the various elements have been cast in bronze then chased and gilt.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe candelabra were made to a design by the architect James Stuart (1713-1788) by a major ormolu manufacturer, Diedrich Nicolaus Anderson (died 1767).  He is known to have exhibited tripods after Stuart's designs at the Free Society of Artists in London in 1761.  Anderson was employed by the leading architects of the 1760s, including Sir William Chambers (1723-1796) and Robert Adam (1728-1792).  His patrons included Hugh Percy, 1st  Duke of Northumberland, at Syon House near London, and Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Baron Scarsdale, at Kedleston Hall, Derbyshire.  This candelabrum is very similar to a pair made for Spencer House, London.  Few details are known of ormolu manufacturers working before Matthew Boulton (1728-1809), although the London trade must have been quite substantial. Anderson is one of the very few manufacturers in the capital who has been identified.\n\nPeople\nMatthew Boulton bought models from Anderson's widow in 1768, and in 1770 he acquired much of the remaining stock from Anderson's shop.  Boulton was clearly heavily influenced by Anderson's models and designs: his candelabra have bases very similar to those on this Anderson three-light candelabrum.",
