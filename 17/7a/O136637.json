An ambassador's silver, set out at official functions, reflected both his status and that of the English crown, so the cups were designed to impress. They were supplied by Samuel Smythin, the Royal Goldsmith, but made in the workshop of Phillip Rollos, one of the most important London goldsmiths.\n\nThe casting and chased ornament on the body are of exceptional quality, as would be expected of a major Huguenot workshop with a royal and aristocratic clientele.
