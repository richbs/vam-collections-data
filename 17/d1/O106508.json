Pluto wears a crown and carries a long-handled fork or trident; he bestrides the chariot, grasping Proserpine around the waist.  Proserpine is in an attitude of resistance, with her foot lifted behind her, and one hand struggling with his hand, her head flung back and her hair flying.  In the sky above are two winged putti, one with a flaming torch over Pluto, the other holding the reins and urging the horses on with a whip.  Set in gold ring.",

            "public_access_description": "The art of engraving gemstones can be traced back to ancient Greece in the 8th century BC and earlier.  Techniques passed down to the Egyptians and then to the Romans.  There were major revivals of interest in engraved gems in Europe during the Byantine era, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and again in the 18th and 19th centuries.  At each stage cameos and intaglios, these skillful carvings on a minute scale, were much prized and collected, sometimes as symbols of power mounted in jewelled settings, sometimes as small objects for private devotion or enjoyment.  This gem is in the neo-classical style popular in the late 1700s and early 1800s, when taste in the arts echoed the subject matter and style of the Greek and Roman masters. Thousands of gems were made in this style in Italy and brought back by British Grand Tourists, who went there to visit the newly-discovered classical antiquities and archaeological sites.  Subjects from Greek mythology were popular, and certain scenes were often portrayed using versions of the same stock images.  This cameo depicts the scene described by the Roman poet Ovid, recounting the reasons for the changing seasons.  Pluto, the god who ruled the underworld, carried off Proserpine, daughter of the earth goddess Ceres, by force to his kingdom of the undereworld.  Jupiter ordered him to release her, but before he did so Pluto made her eat pomegranate seeds, the traditional food of the dead.  This ensured that for part of the year Proserpine was free to return to the earth, bringing life and Spring with her, but for the months represented by the eating of the seeds she would have to return to him in his kingdom below, and winter would reign in the world above.",

Although the gemstone collection is not as comprehensive as that found at the Natural History Museum in London, it is of particular historic interest, as its formation pre-dates the development of many synthetic stones and artificial enhancements. All the stones were mounted as rings before they came to the Museum.  Some are held in the Sculpture Section, other more elaborately mounted ones in the Metalwork Section.\n\nAs well as being a clergyman, collector and dillettante, the Reverend Townshend wrote poetry.  He met Robert Southey in 1815 and through him the Wordsworths, the Coleridges and John Clare.  He was a friend of Charles Dickens and dedicatee of his novel 'Great Expectations'.",
