While it is evident that the structure consists entirely of lengths of woven stainless steel wire, the nature of the connections between the base and the eight rising panels is not immediately apparent.",

Kumai graduated from Tokyo University of Arts in 1966 and personally teaches in Niigata Prefecture in northern central Japan. She is one of  the many women artists, who following the example of Takagi Toshiko (1924-87), have produced some of the most exciting and challenging fibre works of recent years. Kumai's interests are very broad-ranging. As well as producing large sculptural works, she is also involved in the making of objects of a more functional nature. These include screens, hangings and articles of clothing.",
