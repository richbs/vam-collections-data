He was billed enthusiastically as \u2018London\u2019s Greatest Comedian\u2019. From all the principal London music halls\u2019. This is one of the many superb caricatures of Edwardian music hall performers that were drawn by the artist George Cooke when he was based at the Grand Theatre. He compiled them in a series of albums. \n\nBoyde had topped the bill at the Grand the previous February, when his act went down very well. His comic \u2018ditty\u2019 based on the breakfast table and his slapstick sketch about an old man in a lodging house, who holds a big slab of bread and jam, into which he is pushed face down by fellow lodgers, were particularly popular. Cooke features Boyde again in the frontispiece illustration to this album of caricatures. Boyde was popular at Hanley, returning in October 1905 and 1906. He died in October 1909, aged 39.",

Boyde appeared on the bill at Hanley again in October 1905 and 1906, and a review of his 1905 performance mentions this sketch Bread and Jam in which he played an old man holding a slab of bread and jam, into which he is pushed face down by fellow lodgers in a boarding house.The caricature comes from the first of several albums compiled by the graphic artist George Cooke, featuring performers working in music hall in the early 20th century.  The album is dated 1903-4-5.",
