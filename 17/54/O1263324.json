            "public_access_description": "As a lifelong Beatles fan, the designer Peter Dean wanted to recreate the original poster that inspired John Lennon in 1967 to write the song For The Benefit of Mr. Kite. Printed in Rochdale by Jones & Crosskill, the original poster advertised Pablo Fanque's Circus appearing in the town meadows in Rochdale in February 1843. Using a photograph of Lennon standing beside the poster Peter Dean deduced its measurements and design, and worked with the wood engraving artist Andy English to create the illustrations, and the printer Graham Bignell to recreate the typeface from his stock of antique font at his printing press, the New North Press in Shoreditch, where it was hand-inked and hand-pulled on an original Victorian 'Albion' press. The recreated poster was published in October 2012 by TAG Fine Arts in an edition of 1,976 to commemorate the release date of the album Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band on which the song originally featured.\n\nThe original poster was bought by Lennon in January 1967 from an antiques shop in Sevenoaks, Kent, during a break in filming a promotional film shot for Strawberry Fields Forever.It advertised the 'last night but three' of Pablo Fanque's Circus at Rochdale, a Benefit performance for Messrs. William Kite and John Henderson, which meant that they took a percentage of the profits of that night's takings. Mr. Kite is advertised as being 'late of Wells' Circus', performing on his horse Zanthus and on the tightrope, while Mr. Henderson is advertised throwing twenty-one somersaults ('somersets') and leaping on a trampoline and over men, horses and fire.  Pablo Fanque was William Derby (1796-1871) who grew up in Norwich and was apprenticed to the circus proprietor William Batty in about 1810. A talented equestrian, tightrope walker and acrobat, William Derby was Britain's first black circus owner in 1841, operating mainly in the north of England under his stage name Pablo Fanque. \n\nLennon's lyrics were inspired by the information on the poster, and some details were taken verbatim, whilst others were changed in the interests of rhyme and scansion, including 'Pablo Fanque's Circus Royal' which became 'Pablo Fanque's Fair' taking place at Bishopsgate instead of Rochdale, and Mr. Henderson changing to 'the Hendersons' who would 'all be there/late of Pablo Fanque's Fair' replacing the original information that Mr Kite was 'late of Wells' Circus'.",
