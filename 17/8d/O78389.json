Pugin (1812-1852) for both serving and storing food. The carved foliage in the upper doors of this cabinet is pierced to allow air to circulate. Bread, cheese and fruit were stored in the cabinet between meals.\n\nPeople\nAugustus Welby Northmore Pugin (1812-1852) designed this cabinet for the dining room in his own home, The Grange, Ramsgate, Kent. He was very knowledgeable about Medieval furniture and based his design on examples that he had seen. He decorated the upper part of the cabinet with his monogram. The coat of arms on the right hand door is that of the Pugin family. On the left hand door is the Welby coat of arms, his mother's family.\n\nPlace\nThe Grange, Ramsgate, Kent, was designed and built between 1843 and 1844. As well as living there with his wife and eight children, Pugin used the library study as his office. He designed many of the furnishings for this house.",
