Spill-containers and chimney ornaments in brass were especially popular.  The shafts are telescopic, and each contains a folded silk or paper sheet which opens out to make a small circular screen.  The brass mounts were fitted into the top of the shaft.\n\nMaker\nUnderneath the foot is a label which reads 'B. Days' patent chimney ornaments to represent Gothic architecture are so constructed that they may be used for fire-screens, flower or scent jars, time-piece cases, candle-shades and various useful purposes.  Manufactured by Patentee, Snow Hill, Birmingham.  Appointed manufacturer to His Majesty.  The portability and elegance of these fire-screens give them decided preference to all others'.\n\nOrnaments of this form have plaques on the base, stamped Day's Patent with the Royal coat of arms.\n\nDesign Attitude\nThe designs are loosely based on Gothic architecture and were manufactured by stamping or casting.  Day was a prosperous Birmingham manufacturer whose 'Birmingham Gothic' wares were particularly despised by the Gothic Revival architect and designer A.W.N. Pugin (1812-52).  In his True Principles of Pointed or Christian Architecture, published in 1841, Pugin severely lampooned these products. One is illustrated in his plate 24 and entitled 'Patterns of Brummagen Gothic'.",
