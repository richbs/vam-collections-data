Although the first silver teapots date from the late 17th century, by the time this teapot was made in the 1780s, the object was a familiar one in many households. A wide choice of material, including cheaper ceramics and glass as well as inexpensive metal products such as Sheffield plate and tinned copper, expanded the market for tea wares. A silver teapot was the most expensive of the available products. In 1740 a Mrs Code ordered a tea service for \u00a358 10s 6d from the goldsmith George Wickes, including a tea pot for \u00a36 5s. Flat dishes and raised teapot stands were developed to prevent tea dripping on the table or heat from the pot damaging the wood surface.\n\nPeople\nThis teapot and stand were made by the Swedish-born silversmith Andrew Fogelberg (born about 1732; died about 1815), who was established in London by the 1770s, and his partner Stephen Gilbert. This successful  partnership lasted from 1780 to 1793. The teapot and stand may have been designed by the architect Sir William Chambers (1723-1796).\n\nDesign\nThe ram's-heads, swags and wave pattern variations on the cover and body show a sophisticated use of Neo-classical ornament.",
