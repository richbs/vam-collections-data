Although the earliest printed use of the phrase in English only dates to 1640, see saws were around from at least the late middle ages, and in their simplest form consisted of a branch or plank of wood balanced across a log.  These earlier versions were known by various dialect names such as 'jiddy cum jidy' and 'tetter-ma-tawter'.\n\nThis chair version is a much safer way of playing see saw, and suitable for very young children. Chair see saws were often found in kindergartens and infants' schools.",
