            "history_note": "This piece is in the so-called Herrera style, derived from the decoration of the Escorial palace in Madrid for Philip II undertaken by the architect Juan de Herrera. Characterised by a blend of richness and austerity, the plain, but heavy gilt surfaces and architectural forms contrast with the rich colour of the enamel bosses. Such pieces were always highly prized, as shown by a still-life `portrait' by Juan Bautista de Espinosa, around 1585.\nWalter Leo Hildburgh was one of the most dedicated and generous patrons in the history of the V&A. His name is not well-known outside the museum world, but his influence on the shaping of the collections was immense. Born in New York in 1876, he trained as a scientist. Initially his collecting interest was ethnography, but after 1914 he turned to the decorative arts. His tastes were eclectic, but he developed his closest links with the Departments of Metalwork and Sculpture. Encouraged by successive Keepers of Metalwork, he began to accumulate European silver, with the gaps in the existing collections in mind. He travelled widely on collecting expeditions, usually recording when and where he bought something, but not (frustratingly for posterity) from whom. \nHildburgh's abiding passion was the art of Spain and Portugal, and it is no coincidence that the Museum holds one of the finest collections of Hispanic silver in the world. He also fell into the charming habit of giving the Museum presents at Christmas and on his own birthday.  In some ways he was a shadowy figure, living frugally in a flat surrounded by what he called `the Museum mistakes', and devoting all his resources to collecting, but he is known to have been a keen skater. From 1924 when he offered the first objects to the Museum on loan, to 1956 when the huge  collection was bequeathed, Hildburgh was  part of the Museum landscape. We continue to benefit from his generosity; his will set up a fund for future purchases, administered in the spirit of his earlier acquisitions.\n\nTS: very nice piece - keep with other Herrara pieces. Acquisition RF: 55/4478A. Neg no.: 80162\n\nHistorical significance: Although salts are a frequent item in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century inventories, few examples like this one survive. There is an almost identical piece in the Alorda Derksen collection (Barcelona), differing only in that it has applied feet on the base section alone (see Esteras Mart\u00edn: 2005, cat. no. 24).",
