Her models were chosen from her children. Here her daughter Clementina (1847-1901) models as an 'Odalisque', but of a curiously fractured and photographic kind.\n\nHistorical significance: The psychological complexity of Lady Hawarden's images of women has inspired modern viewers to interpret her work in terms of feminist issues. Ingrid Sischy has suggested intriguing parallels between Lady Hawarden's 'Photographic Studies' and the 'Untitled Film Stills' of Cindy Sherman (American, born 1954).",
