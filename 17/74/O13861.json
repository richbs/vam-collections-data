The panel at the centre back is veiled in gathered tulle and a ruche of the same tulle trims the slightly pointed waist.\n\nThe lining is of matching silk, boned at the seams, and fastens with laces at the centre back. The centre back panel is hooked into place and there are hooks in the lower border. The waist band is printed with a gilt, cursive signature with a number written in ink on the reverse. \n[Skirt] The skirt matches the bodice. A motif, similar to that on the bodice, is applied at the hip and the hem is trimmed with festoons of the ground material. There are remains of a tulle flounce at the hem. The skirt is straight cut and fitted to the hips in front and the double inverted pleats at the centre back flow into the slightly flared train.\n\nIt is lined with matching silk taffeta with ribbons to adjust the train's fullness. The lining of the train has a gathered, scalloped pink facing frill.\n\nThe skirt fastens at the centre back with brass metal hooks and eyes. There are tape loops at the waist for hanging.",

It belonged to Miss Anne Thomson of Philadelphia, daughter of Frank Thomson, an early collector of Impressionist paintings.\n\nThe dress is embellished with lace motifs in a pattern of carnations and embroidered with pastes (imitation gemstones). Deep swags of pink roses are draped over the upper arms, and pink tulle is arranged in bows on the shoulder and as trimming on the hem of the skirt. Similar dresses with bows on the shoulder and floral trimmings are illustrated in The Queen for 1897. \n\nThe dress is reminiscent of designs by the couturier Charles Frederick Worth. Although Worth favoured tulle and flowers, this model does not appear in the guard books of his designs.",
