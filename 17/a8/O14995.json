It has a flavour of the period; the composition is elegantly spare and reflects the pervasive influence of Japanese art at the end of the nineteenth century. Though she went on to work as an Official War Artist, and also painted figure subjects and portraits, Airy specialised in flowers and botanical studies. As we have seen flower-painting was thought to be a 'quiet, unpretending womanly employment' (according to the novelist Mary Russell Mitford) and was consequently devalued by being seen as simply a genteel accomplishment rather than a professional occupation. Nevertheless a number of women worked successfully as illustrators of the many botanical periodicals published in the nineteenth century.",
