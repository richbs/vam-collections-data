All these drawings may have a provenance other than the collection of the younger Wren.

E.398-1951 occupies a somewhat ambiguous position between the two groups as it may be associated with both Wren and the office of Vanbrugh (see the discussion of the problem in the cataloguing of this drawing under Sir C.Wren and N.Hawksmoor, in this list).  6 other drawings from the Bute Collection, E.384-389-1951, by an unidentified hand, which relate to Ham House, Surrey, were also acquired by the Museum.\n\nThe catalogue entries for all the drawings may be found under the following headings or artists' names:\n\nANONYMOUS:Architecture\nANONYMOUS: Architecture and Topography\nARCHER, T.\nHAWKSMOOR, N.\nLONDON, G.\nVANBRUGH, Sir J.\nWISE, H.\nWREN, Sir C.'\n\n<u>Victoria and Albert Museum Department of Prints and Drawings and Department of Paintings, Accessions 1951</u> London: HMSO, 1962.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n'<b>BUTE COLLECTION of architectural drawings</b>\n\nE.398-445-1951 were brought for the Museum by the National Art-Collections Fund at the sale of the collection of architectural drawings owned by the Marquess of Bute held at Messrs.
