Here, though, the whole vessel is moulded in great detail to convey a three-quarter length figure of a man dressed in costume fashionable in the mid-sixteenth century.  The pewter lid, openable by flicking the thumbpiece attached to the handle, doubles as the man's hat. Such a jug would have been used to hold beer or wine at the table upon which might also be found other vessels such as those the man is depicted as holding - a rather more conventional Cologne stoneware jug and a facetted green glass drinking flute.  \nDespite a long earthenware potting tradition from the time of the Roman occupation, the Cologne stoneware industry began rather later than that of other Rhineland towns.  By about 1500, however, Cologne was producing small mugs and jugs with applied moulded botanical decoration. Although there were several thriving stoneware workshops in Cologne in the first half of the century, the city authorities were concerned about the fumes and fire risk.  Prohibitions and tax increases forced many potters to leave the city to set up instead in nearby Frechen.  \nThe jug was formerly in the Weckherlin Collection, objects from which formed the core of the South Kensington (now V&A) Museum's German stoneware collection on their acquisition in 1868.  The Weckherlin Collection was acquired by a fellow Belgian, the art dealer, publisher and patron of the Pre-Raphaelite painters, Jean Joseph Ernest Theodore Gambart who came to London in 1840 and took British citizenship in 1846.  He displayed the collection in his London house \"Rosenstead\",  Avenue Road, near Regent's Park, until a gas explosion caused him to reconsider the long-term security of his remaining pots - he sold 62 objects to the Museum for \u00a3800.  This jug was then worth \u00a38-10s.",

            "history_note": "The jug was formerly in the Weckherlin Collection, objects from which formed the core of the South Kensington (now V&A) Museum's German stoneware collection on their acquisition in 1868.  The Weckherlin Collection was acquired by a fellow Belgian, the art dealer, publisher and patron of the Pre-Raphaelite painters, Jean Joseph Ernest Theodore Gambart who came to London in 1840 and took British citizenship in 1846.  He displayed the collection in his London house \"Rosenstead\",  Avenue Road, near Regent's Park, until a gas explosion caused him to reconsider the long-term security of his remaining pots - he sold 62 objects to the Museum for \u00a3800.  This jug was then worth \u00a38-10s.\n\nHistorical significance: Despite a long earthenware potting tradition from the time of the Roman occupation, the Cologne stoneware industry began rather later than that of other Rhineland towns such as Siegburg and Raeren.  By about 1500, however, it had caught up and was already making small mugs and jugs with applied moulded botanical decoration. There were several thriving stoneware workshops in Cologne in the sixteenth century but the city authorities were concerned about the fumes and fire risk.  Prohibitions and tax increases forced many potters to leave the city during 1540s and 1550s and by 1566, stoneware production in Cologne had become negligible.  Most potters moved to nearby Frechen, from where in any case, several of the potting families had originated.  Frechen had a number of Lutheran communities by 1540s so it may also have been the case that religious intolerance had contributed towards the migration of potters from Cologne.",

            "historical_context_note": "Stoneware is a robust, non-porous and durable material.  German potters found these characteristics ideal for the manufacture of drinking and storage vessels which became indispensable to daily life in late medieval Germany. \nThe development of a true stoneware body  in the Rhineland was achieved by about 1300-50 by a process of careful experimentation entirely uninfluenced by Far  Eastern expertise.  The local clays became fully fused at 1200-1300\u00b0C, and early wares were unglazed or ash-glazed.  During the fifteenth century, potters discovered that salt thrown into the kiln would vaporise and form a pleasing tight-fitting glaze.  The colour varies from buff to dark brown but the glaze is easily recognisable from its 'orange-peel' appearance. Salt-glazing demanded vast quantities of salt for every firing.  This was imported through Cologne for sale to all the Rhenish potteries.  During the sixteenth century, German stoneware achieved huge economic success and attained a peak of technical and decorative refinement.  \nThis unusual and attractive jug is a version of the ubiquitous Bartmann bottle so-called because of its applied bearded facemask, but in this case, the whole vessel is moulded in great detail to convey a three-quarter length figure of a man.  He is dressed in fashionable clothes of the mid-sixteenth century and is intended to represent a wealthy merchant or noble. The jug would have been used to hold beer or wine at the table upon which might also be found other vessels such as those the man is depicted as holding - a more conventional Cologne stoneware jug and a facetted green glass drinking flute (Stangenglas).  The pewter lid, openable by flicking the thumbpiece attached to the handle, doubles as the man's hat.",
