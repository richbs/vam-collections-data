He was an eclectic painter and spent the forty last years of his life in Palermo where he was a teacher in the local Accademia.\n\nThis painting is a good example of the new realist movement which developed in Italy particularly in Naples and Lombardy. It shows the three-quarter profile of an old man holding a violin and wearing a flabby hat, which probably defined him as a poor fiddler earning his living by playing his instrument from place to places. This picture illustrates well the new attention to social concerns in art during the second half of the 19th century.",

Educated at Leeds Grammar School, and was deputy chairman of the London, Chatham and Dover Railway Company 1869-70.  Died Winslade, near Exeter, 7 December 1885.  Bequeathed all his collection of drawings, watercolours and oil paintings to the Bethnal Green Museum; they have since been transferred to the V&A.  He also collected engravings, Japanese vases and panels, and bronze and marble sculpture.\n\nHistorical significance: This work depicts in three-quarter profile the bust of an old man holding a violin and wearing a floppy hat, evidently a street musician. The sitter's gaze establishes direct contact with the viewer. The brushwork is refined and smooth, with a dark brownish palette. This work was attributed to Luigi di Giovanni on the basis of its signature 'Giovanni' (lower right). Only a few works have been attributed to him, a similar example being <i>The finding of Pietro Micca's Body</i>, Galleria d'Arte Moderna, Turin. Domenico Morelli's <i>Portrait of Giacinto Gigante</i>, 1859, in the Museo Nazionale di San Martino, Naples, has a similar technique.</p>",

He was an eclectic painter and spent the last forty years of his life in Palermo, where he taught at the local Accademia.\n\nRealist paintings emerged in the 19th century primarily as a 'negation of the Ideal' (Gustave Courbet in <i>Le r\u00e9alisme</i>, 1855). Social realism was influential in Naples, as is apparent from the works of Domenico (1815-1878) and Gerolamo Induno (1827-1890), Giacinto Gigante (1806-1876) and Domenico Morelli.",
