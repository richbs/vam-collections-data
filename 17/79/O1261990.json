In 1944 he wrote The Silent Traveller in Oxford. The illustrations show a development in his artistic style, revealing a new naive aesthetic and heightened colour. Along with the illustrations were published poems written in Chinese calligraphy. This poem reads;  \" Above the distant trees a host of rooks gossip in the sunset ; The little bridge and the running water are like those in my homeland. The chimes of the bells vibrate in pursuit of the rising mist, In the midst of the emerald green lies the ancient church.\"",
