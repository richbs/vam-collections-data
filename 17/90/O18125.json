His earliest works earned him the description of realist, but from about 1830 he concentrated more on Romantic alpine scenery and rapacious wild animals. A member of the Vienna Academy from 1836, his great popularity with both the Austrian aristocracy and foreign patrons is attested by the high prices listed in his account book. His later work tended to be duller and repetitive. \nLit. R. Feuchtm\u00fcller, <i>Friedrich  Gauermann 1807-62,</i> Vienna, 1962.\n\n91 \nWILD BOARS AND WOLF \nSigned and dated lower right <i>F.

Gauermann 1835</i> \nFA.78. <i>Sheepshanks Gift.</i> \n  \nIn a dark and threatening forest, a boar protects his family and eyes with suspicion the intruding wolf. It is a very nordic forest, a type well known in Austrian painting from the time of Altdorfer and the 16th-century Danube school, here adapted to the greater naturalism of 19th-century Romantic painting. Romantic, also, are the humanized animals, typical of the period and very similar in conception to Landseer's. It is not surprising perhaps that Sheepshanks, friend and patron of Landseer, should have selected Gauermann as the sole foreign representative in his gift of contemporary masters.\n \nGauermann was paid the high price of 500 florins by Sheepshanks for this picture and it is clearly a major work. He was one of the most popular Austrian painters of the time, much sought after both by the Austrian aristocracy and by foreign patrons, among whom <i>Schipings</i>, as he called Sheepshanks, was only one of many. Indeed, when the Prince Consort visited the newly opened picture galleries at the South Kensington Museum on 19 June 1857 he singled out Gauermann's two animal paintings: 'In looking through the South Gallery, he noticed two pictures by Gauermann. He seemed to know him and his works. \"He was\", said the Prince, \"Court painter of animals and he also painted the late Emperor of Austria and all his family ... \"' (F M Redgrave, <i>Richard Redgrave, a memoir</i>, 1891, p.174). There is no record of Gauermann ever painting the Austrian Emperor and one may suspect that this was a royal joke. \n\nMichael Kauffmann\"\nWaagen, G.F., <u>Treasures of Art in Great Britain</u>, vol. 2, London 1854, p.306.\n<u>Inventory of the Pictures, Drawings, Etchings, &c, in the British Fine Art Collections deposited in the New Gallery, South Kensington.

The execution is also careful, though the tone of colouring is somewhat heavy. These are the only pictures in the collection not by native artists'.\n\nThe present work is one of  Gauermann's most impressive paintings.
