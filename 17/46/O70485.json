He is usually portrayed, as here, holding a clapper to warn people of his approach, and with a sore on his leg. The accompanying dog is also one of his standard attributes. The figure was probably carved in the region of Rioja, in the east of Spain. \nRoch (c. 1350-c. 1380) was born to a rich merchant family in the south of France in Montpellier, but became a hermit, and made a pilgrimage to Rome. While in Italy he caught the plague, and was fed by a dog, who is seen here licking one of the saint's infected sores. He was reputed to have miraculously cured those suffering from the plague, and people therefore frequently prayed before images of him to request his help. His cult was widespread in Europe in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and he is often depicted in sculptures and paintings in Spain, Italy, France and Germany.",
