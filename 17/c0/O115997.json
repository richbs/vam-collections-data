The previous owner, Lord Annaly, states that it certainly belonged to his grandfather, 3rd Viscount Glifden and 2nd Baron Dover (b. 1825; d. 1866) and that it was probably in  the family even earlier. He thinks it was always at Holdenby House, Northants, though it may conceivably have been at Dover House, Whitehall, London, at an earlier date. The 3rd Viscount Clifden married a Miss Seymour, who was the great grand-daughter of Franois, 1st Marquess of Hertford. Lord Annaly states that his mother commissioned a copy of the bust and that this now belongs to Lord Spencer, his brother-in-law, and is at Althorpe. An Italian sculptor living in London, called Manente, states that he executed the copy in 1922. The then Lord Annaly died shortly afterwards and the copy was delivered to the executors in 1923. Manente retained the plaster cast of the original and presented it to the museum (to keep or destroy) in 1951, The cast is certainly made from this present bust.",
