In 1807 he entered the RA schools, and exhibited his first painting there. Made his name with 'The Disposal of a Favourite Lamb' in 1813; elected ARA 1814, RA 1820. Achieved great popularity with his landscapes and, particularly, rustic genre scenes in the 1820s; Ruskin highly praised his works in the 1840s. Married in 1822 the sister of the portrait painter Margaret Carpenter. Travelled extensively in Britain and abroad, especially in Italy 1836-38; these visits are reflected in the subjects he painted. Exhibited 124 works at the RA between 1807 and 1846, and 45 at the BI 1808-43. Librarian at the RA 1840-2. Died London 17 February 1847. His studio sale was at Christie's 31 May-5 June 1847. His two sons were the novelist William Wilkie Collins and the painter Charles Allston Collins. There are watercolours and a sketchbook in the V&A collections. \n\nLIT: \tWilliam Collins 'List of Pictures and Patrons', two MS volumes 1808-27 and 1827-46, National Art Library, V&A (referred to below as Lists); <i>Athenaeum</i> 20 February 1847, p200 (obit); <i>Art Journal</i> 1847, p137 (obit); W Wilkie Collins <i>Memoirs of the Life of William Collins, Esq</i>, RA 2 vols, 1848 (referred to below as <i>Memoirs</i>); <i>Art Journal</i> 1855, p 141 W.

'Hall Sands, Devonshire' appears among work done between April 1845 and April 1846 as painted for Sheepshanks for \u00a3105. Wilkie Collins quotes the artist in his journal for the early months of 1846, as working on the picture despite his illness. One of the artist's last four paintings, it was exhibited at the RA in 1846. Wilkie Collins wrote that its 'purity and truth of effect, once seen, could not be easily forgotten. As a union of delicacy of execution, transparency of tone, and breadth of effect, it is one of the painter's most successful works'. Collins visited Devonshire in the autumn of 1819, exhibiting a few Devon subjects in subsequent years, and convalesced at Torquay in autumn 1845. Hall Sands are south of Torquay, on the east side of the peninsula of Start Point. \n\nEXH: RA 1846 (90)\"",
