Netsuke had to be small and not too heavy, yet bulky enough to do the job. They needed to be compact with no sharp protruding edges, yet also strong and hardwearing. Above all they had to have the means of attaching the cord. Netsuke were made in a variety of forms. This is an example of the manju type. Manju netsuke were shaped and named after a type of rounded sweet dumpling filled with bean paste. They are usually a solid oval, rectangular or square shape and these compact forms were well suited to being worn next to the body. \nThis ivory netsuke depicts Yoshitsune and Benkei fighting on the Gojo Bridge.The bridge is shown on the reverse. The two figures of the heroic warriors stand proud of the surface and are are shown in dramatic close-up. Heroic warriors were also a popular subject for Ukiyoe (floating world) woodblock prints of the time.",
