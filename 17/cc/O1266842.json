            "historical_context_note": "This painting was executed by Pierre-Denis Martin around 1700. Martin was a painter who specialised in panoramic representations of the greatest French estates of the 17th and 18th centuries including such royal properties as Versailles, Marly, Fontainebleau, Chambord and La Muette. According to A. N. Dezallier d\u2019Argenville, the present painting sat in the castle among several similar topographical views in a gallery dedicated to Louis XIV\u2019s military conquests and  described as follows: \u2018On remarque entre autres le plan du ch\u00e2teau et du parc, lequel est fort estim\u00e9 pour ses beaut\u00e9s de d\u00e9tail\u2019 (<i>Voyage pittoresque des environs de Paris ou description des maisons royales, ch\u00e2teaux et autres lieux de plaisance \u00e0 quinze lieues aux environs de cette ville </i><i><i><i>p</i>ublish</i>ed</i> in Paris in 1755).\n\nThe painting shows the estate of Juvisy after its renovation and transformation with in the horizon the city of Paris as it was towards the end of the reign of Louis XIV (died 1715). The ch\u00e2teau was destroyed under the bombing of World War II in 1944, and only a portion of the park has survived as part of the more modest public garden of the town of Juvisy.\n\nPierre-Denis Martin was probably a pupil and a close collaborator of the more famous Jean-Baptiste Martin (1659-1735), with whom he specialised in highly detailed topographical views, a genre per se, derived from the more traditional topographical townscape representations, which reached its apogee in France between the end of the 17th century and the beginning of the 18th century. Jean-Baptiste Martin had trained and collaborated with the Flemish battle painter Adam Frans van der Meulen (1632-1690) who from 1664 was employed by Louis XIV to paint scenes commemorating his military triumphs. \n\nIt is not impossible that the painting was commissioned to Pierre-Denis Martin to commemorate the visit of Louis XIV to the Chateau de Juvisy. Tradition has it that Louis XIV visited the estate on a journey to Fontainebleau in 1677-78.  The figure in the blue redingote in the foreground is therefore traditionally interpreted as the King while the twofigures accompanying him could be his close collaborator and owner of the chateau Antoine Rossignol and his son Bonaventure.  Rossignol was at the time a royal councillor and \u2018President de la cour des comptes\u2019. Well versed in cryptology, he assisted in the fight against the Huguenots, invented the Grand Chiffre for Louis XIV and founded the \u2018Cabinet Noir\u2019, the precursor of all modern secret services. \n\nThe painting shows the chateau de Juvisy acquired by Antoine Rossignol in 1659 who started its renovation and expansion with the addition of large tracts of lands until 1672. The composition pays a large tribute to the design of the garden. One of the greatest formal gardens of the 17th century, the park was designed by the French garden designer Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre (1613-1700) within ten years of the completion of the garden at Vaux-le-Vicomte in 1657, the country residence of Nicolas Fouquet, the Minister of Finance under Louis XIV. \n\nThe design bears the hallmarks of Le Notre\u2019s tour de force, which, unlike Vaux, had to deal at Juvisy with the complex location of the park on the side of the chateau beyond the church rather than at the centre. The parterre en dentelles, which was at Vaux an essential feature to unify the composition, had therefore to be located on a terrace between the church and the canalized river Orge, acting as an introduction to the main park. Following the main pattern of Vaux, the main axis of the garden terminates in a \u2018miroir d\u2019eau\u2019, created by a demi-lune projection on the far bank of the canal while the great slope of the land at Juvisy allows for the construction of a true step cascade. \n\nInspired by Italian models such as the cascades at the Villa Lante and the Villa Garzoni, it predates the Grande Cascade at Sceaux created for Colbert in 1675-1677. The great fountain is composed of a massive balustraded wall comprising seven niches flanked by pilasters surmounted by grostesque masks. Four of the niches contain rocailles while the three others display marble statues of Minerva, Apollo and Hercules. The ornamentation of the park is complemented with marble sculptures, which may have been by the sculptor and member of the Academie des Arts, Michel Anguier (1612-1686) or by his studio.",
