A hinged silver-gilt lid embossed with a floral design is attached by a metal mount bearing a design of fronds and an angel (?) to the top of the handle.  The central part of the tankard is decorated with large applied relief-moulded panels with scenes in separate compartments.  The main scene in the large central panel shows a man and woman dining at a table bearing vessels such as glass Stangen with clearly visible prunts.  In front of the table is a character who could be a court jester with a stick and a dog licks the sores of a poor man who holds out a cup.  Beneath this scene is the inscription 'O ARME LASEROS' (Oh, poor Lazarus) which confirms that the story is that of Dives and Lazarus.  After the inscription are the maker's initials 'Ie' for 'Jan Emens' and the number '8'.  To the right of the central scene, a servant approaches the table with what seems to be bread under a wrap, and to the left of the scene two musicians facing the table play their instruments.  In the compartment below the musicians, is a scene of Adam and Eve being tempted by the serpent (Satan) to take fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in the Garden of Eden, as described in Genesis chapter 3.\nThe parable of Dives and Lazarus is told in Luke 16:19-31.  Jesus described a rich man (sometimes named \"Dives\" i.e. the Latin for 'rich man') who dressed in fine clothes and ate sumptuously every day.  At his gate lay a beggar, Lazarus, who was full of sores which the dogs licked.  He longed to be fed from the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table.  The beggar died and was taken by angels to Abraham's bosom.  The rich man then died and from the flames of hell asked Abraham to send Lazarus to cool his tongue with water.  Abraham replied that Lazarus was now comforted and the rich man tormented and the gulf between them could not be bridged.   The rich man therefore asked Abraham to send Lazarus to warn his brothers.  Abraham refused, explaining that as his brothers had paid no attention to the words of Moses and the Prophets, they would not be persuaded even if someone should rise from the dead.",

The addition here of a hinged silver-gilt lid enriched the appearance of the stoneware vessel, increasing its status as a luxury item.  Decorated wares, especially with attractively embossed precious metal lids were made for owners of high social status.  This tankard is decorated with applied relief-moulded panels, the main scene showing a rich man and woman dining at a table on which such a tankard would not have looked out of place.  The scene here represents the parable told by Jesus in Luke chapter 16, in which the rich man, denies the poor man, Lazarus, food and drink from his table.\nThe tankard was made in the 1570s in the workshop of the skilled stoneware potter Jan Emens Mennicken, in the village of Raeren, then in Germany but now just inside Belgium.\nRaeren wares were the most commonly exported of German stonewares in the early part of the16th century, but from the middle of the century, the Mennicken pottery concentrated on selling more expensive and ornate wares to the German middle and upper classes.  The tankard was formerly in the Weckherlin Collection, objects from which formed the core of the South Kensington (now V&A) Museum's German stoneware collection on their acquisition in 1868.",

            "history_note": "In 1570s, when this object was made, the village of Raeren was in Germany. 12 km. south-east of Aachen between the rivers Rur and Meuse, it is nowadays in Belgium, 1 km from the German border.  The area was ideal for making pots, being rich in stoneware clays and abundant sources of water and wood.  Output was prolific in the 15th to 17th centuries and the potteries catered for local demand as well as exporting to north-west Europe.  \n\nThe tankard was formerly in the Weckherlin Collection, objects from which formed the core of the South Kensington (now V&A) Museum's German stoneware collection on their acquisition in 1868.  The Weckherlin Collection was acquired by a fellow Belgian, the art dealer, publisher and patron of the Pre-Raphaelite painters, Jean Joseph Ernest Theodore Gambart who came to London in 1840 and took British citizenship in 1846.  He displayed the collection in his London house \"Rosenstead\",  Avenue Road, near Regent's Park, until a gas explosion caused him to reconsider the long-term security of his remaining pots - he sold 62 objects to the Museum for \u00a3800.  This tankard was then worth \u00a317.\n\nHistorical significance: Potters from Langerwehe are thought to have moved to Raeren in about 1400 and potting was well-established there by 1480s.  In the 1525-50 period, Raeren wares were of all German stonewares the most frequently traded through Netherlandish ports.  There was demand for these vessels across north-west Europe.  From about 1540, when the potters of Raeren and its vicinity began to form themselves into an association which later became a guild, the pots began to be decorated with ornate and detailed applied moulded relief decoration.  This made the pots more desirable still and enabled the potters to export fewer general wares and charge a higher price for decorated wares which were aimed at the local middle to upper class market.  This Schnelle (tankard) with its elaborate decoration was further enhanced by a beautiful embossed precious metal hinged lid and must have been used by a family of high social status.  The 'Dives and Lazarus' parable portrayed on the central scene would have served as a visual warning to the tankard's owner that a miserable afterlife might result from rejecting the poor during his luxurious lifetime.  Raeren retained prominence in wares such as this until the early 17th century.  This key phase was led by the Mennicken (or Menneken) family of whom the most prolific was Jan Emens Mennicken (1540-93) who signed his wares variously IE, JE, YE, IEM, JEM or YEM from 1566.  His workshop continued to use these and other marks until 1613 (long after his death).  About 180 of his vessels are extant.  He developed the baluster-shaped jug with cylindrical neck and body panels for friezes, and the grey rather than brown body painted with zones or highlights in cobalt-blue (known as Blauwerk) from 1580s.  He is famed for his technical mastery and innovation.",
