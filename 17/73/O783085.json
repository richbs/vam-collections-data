            "bibliography": "<u>Victoria and Albert Museum Department of Engraving, Illustration & Design, Old English Pattern Books of the Metal Trades: A Descriptive Catalogue of the Collection in the Museum.</u> London: Printed under the Authority of His Majesty\u2019s Stationery Office, 1913.\nThe full text of the entry is as follows:\n\n\"<b>FITTINGS FOR FURNITURE AND UPHOLSTERY.</b>\n\nM. 60 a.\n\n<b>Marks.</b>-F.A. 228, 273, and a private mark pencilled inside.\n\n<b>Description.</b>-A brassfounder's catalogue.   7\u215e in. by 12 in., 179 plates, some folding.   No date, but a water mark in one plate, 1814 (?).   Bound in stiff mottled boards with leather back.\nE.2325-1910.\n\n<b>Summary of Contents.</b>-Taper holders, small brassfoundry for cabinet makers and domestic use, sash fasteners, blind cord racks, pulleys, latches, drop handles, bed bell pull grips for rope and ribbon, lock furniture, crank bell fittings, bolts, brass wood screws, knobs and handles, escutcheons, ball and claw feet for furniture with and without castors, three wheel and socket castors, fittings for folding top tables, \"patent\" table slides and fasteners, drop drawer handles, fender footmen, rappers, chimney-piece figures for candles, candle brackets and sockets, curtain and screen fittings, stair rods, mouldings and beadings, warded trunk locks, vent pegs, corner clips for boxes, clock-case furniture, slide flush bolts, mountings for wooden trays and plate warmers, and hinges in variety.\n\n<b>Comments.</b>-A good all round list particularly strong in furniture fittings.   Some of the engravings are in excellent taste and would bear reproducing in modern brass foundry. The shape of the mortice lock furniture on Plate 46 and some of the drop handles on Plates 101, 101A, 101B, 101C, are examples worth noting.  The door rappers are of exceptional interest, and it is not improbable that a saunter with a sketch book round the old squares and streets of Westminster and Belgravia would yield a harvest of pictures coated with paint as to leave no suggestion of the bronze and brass of which they are made.   There is an index pasted inside the front cover.   The prices are engraved on the page.   <i>See illustration, plate II.</i>\"",
