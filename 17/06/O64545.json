Undoubtedly the balcony scene costume, worn during one of the longest pas de deux in the ballet, was replaced on a regular basis and there is no indication of when this costume might have been worn.\n\nHistorical significance: An example of a costume worn by Fonteyn in a ballet by Kenneth MacMillan, The Royal Ballet's leading choreographer after Ashton.  The roles of Juliet and Romeo were created by Fonteyn and Nureyev, amid much controversy as it was known that MacMillan had actually created the ballet around Lynn Seymour and Christopher Gable - but Opera House politics decreed that two relatively unknown dancers should not take the first night of a major new production.  The 46-year-old Fonteyn, however, was acclaimed as Juliet; it remained one of her most memorable interpretations and she and Nureyev were subsequently filmed in the roles.",
