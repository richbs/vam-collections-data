The roof is a complete unit pasted together using its supports to neatly fit into prescribed slots at the top of the house.The rectangular boxes outside each set of windows need to be opened and closed and so are attached to the house by a peg at the top and bottom. The windows act as sliding doors allowing access to the balconies and garden. The back door is fixed leading to the bathroom and toilet. There are two rooms, one on each floor. They are connected by a staircase which is hidden behind sliding doors downstairs. The whole sits on a square base.",
