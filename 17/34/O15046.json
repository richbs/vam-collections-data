Inscribed 'I won't, I don't', it represents a bride seeing the spectre of a former sweetheart, clutching his broken heart as he rises up behind her bridegroom. It may, however, allude to the marriage of Effie Gray (who once owned the drawing) to John Ruskin in 1848. At the date that the drawing was made, she and Millais were in love. Her marriage was annulled in 1854 and they married the following year. The figure on the right could be Ruskin's father, a dominating man who tried to run his son's life, and the ghost Ruskin's grandfather, who committed suicide. It is an image of great intensity, remarkable for its convincing rendition of the natural and supernatural. The drawing is, however, unfinished. Perhaps the subject became too painful for Millais to pursue.",
