The OWI (Office of War Information) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture saw the need for the recruitment of auxiliary support assembled from the Victory Farm Volunteers.  The largest group employed in the emergency labour force, the VFV, known as the Crop Corps, was made up of high-school students, and training usually began at school.  Once they were posted, groups of students were often supervised by a member of the Women's Land Army.  Here the two healthy and happy young people symbolise the valuable, positive work undertaken by the volunteers.  The inclusion of a boy and a girl shows that this sort of work was open to all.  Illustrated below are the kinds of activities that they could expect to be engaged in, demonstrating the rich yield of American agriculture.",
