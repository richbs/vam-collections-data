The ballet was produced by the Ballets de Paris at the Princes Theatre, London, on 21 February 1949.  It was a sensational hit, partly for its uninhibited sensuality and realism, partly for the brilliant designs by Antoni Clav\u00e9 but especially for the performance of Jeanmaire as Carmen.  Hitherto she had been known as a strong classical soloist, but Petit reinvented her and her dazzling, mocking, seductive performance established her as a major star and led to her subsequent career as 'Zizi' Jeanmaire, star of the Paris Lido and cabaret.\nThe fan was used in a major solo establishing Carmen's flirtatious character and the Theatre Museum also owns the costume worn by Jeanmaire in that solo (S.120-1981).  \nThe fan was given to Cyril Beaumont, who called Jeanmaire's performance worthy to stand beside Elssler's Esmeralda and Karsavina's Thamar.  It came to the Museum as part of the Cyril Beaumont Bequest.",
