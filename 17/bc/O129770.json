For the engraved metal plate and two hundred examples of this print, D\u00fcrer was paid two hundred gold coins and enough luxurious damask cloth to make a coat. \n\nD\u00fcrer had seen Albrecht of Brandenburg at a political gathering in Augsburg in 1518 and made a drawing of him in black chalk. In the chalk drawing the cardinal is looking in the opposite direction and the background is blank. It was this chalk drawing which D\u00fcrer then used as the basis of his engraving. The textile hanging strung from loops on a wooden or metal rod in the background which bisects the background horizontally, was added when the drawing was turned into an engraving. So too was the coat of arms which incorporates the distinctive wide-brimmed, flat, (red) hat with multi-tasselled ties, worn by cardinals in the Renaissance. This cardinal\u2019s other titles are given in Latin in the inscription above his head while the strip across the bottom reads \u201cThus were his eyes, his cheeks, his features at the age of 29, 1519.\u201d",

The engraving was commissioned by the cardinal himself, as we know from the artist's letter written in early 1520 to Georg Spalatin, an adviser of Friedrich the Wise of Saxony:\n\nI am enclosing three prints of an engraving for my gracious lord [i.e. Friedrich the Wise]. It was engraved at the request of my gracious lord of Mainz [Cardinal Albrecht]. I sent the copper plate to him together with two hundred impressions as a present. He then sent me most kindly two hundred gold guilders in return and twenty ells of damask for a coat.'
