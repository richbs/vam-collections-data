Franz Eher & Sons, Munich/ Subscription costs: 0,80 Reichsmark/ is published once a week, sent from Munich/ 'In the Name of Civilisation...'/ The plutocratic war agitators in London and Paris are pleading for mercy now that the war, which they instigated, is now ravaging their own countries - in the name of civilisation, of course.\n\nConcerning civilisation, we remember, that in its name Churchill and his comrades once during the war carried out a certain hunger strike against us and thus killed hundreds of thousands of German women, elderly people and children...\n\nWe also remember that in the name of civilisation, defenceless German women on the Rhine and the Ruhr [Rivers] were once violated [raped] by French Negroes and German workers were shot down like dogs by them...\n\nApparently, the French Minister Monet was also speaking in the name of civilisation a few weeks ago when referring to the newest Franco-British blockade attempts, and using the following known words:\n\"It won't be so terrible if a few hundred thousand German women and children will starve to death again. That's what war is for.\"\n\nWe also still remember exactly what one could read in the French press a little while ago:\n\"We have to humiliate the Germans much greater than [we did] in Versailles. If they queue under French bayonets in French field kitchens - then it is right!\"\n\nSo that's what they were attempting to do with us: standing in a line in fornt of their field kitchens under the bayonets of the French Negroes in the name of civilisation! We already came to know these \"civilised\" blessings of the overseas plutocrats. It will not happen a second time.\n\nThat is why Germany will fight, with stern determination, until victorious in this war which has been instigated by the plutocratic war criminals in London and Paris - for a true European Civilisation!!!\n Responsible for the content: Hannes Kremner, Munich/ Published by Franz Eher & Sons, Munich 1940",

This text-heavy propaganda poster was meant to inform the German public about threats from the enemy. It deliberately references provocative foreign quotes calling for the starvation of the German people and preys on basic human fears about the safety of women, children and the elderly. As was unfortunately common at the time, this poster alsoexploits the racist preconceptions of its readers in order to manipulate the German audience for the cause of winning the war. This poster also repeatedly depicts the German population as victims of a war instigated by others.",
