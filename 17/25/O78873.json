This example has been printed with a vertical design, suiting it for use as a border for curtains. In this period - the early 19th century - it was fashionable for the different furnishings used in a room, including window curtains and upholstery fabric, to match or complement each other. The textiles could be printed to shape to correspond to their function.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe manufacturer's name for this design was 'The Half Moon and 7 Stars Furniture'. The distinctive colour scheme, a combination called 'pompeian', appeared as part of the fashion for Egyptian and classical styles in furnishings between about 1804 and 1809.\n\nPlaces\nBannister Hall printworks, near Preston, Lancashire, was the leading printworks for wood-block furniture chintzes and set the fashion for other factories. London linen drapers such as Richard Ovey of Covent Garden (from 1790 to 1831 the leading London merchant for 'furniture prints') commissioned designs from skilled artists and sent them to Lancashire or to Carlisle in Cumbria to be printed for their London shops.",
