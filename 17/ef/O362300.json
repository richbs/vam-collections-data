These are arranged in alternating and staggering rows across the breadth of the fabric. On either side of the front skirt and trimming the sleeves are bands of green gimp braid with wound pink silk ball embellishments. The dress, the bodice of which is now separated from the skirt, was once, from the remains of stitches and pleat marks, probably attached, with the fullness arranged in tight organ pleats.\n\nThe neck, sleeves, and back bodice are faced with white silk. It, like the skirt, is lined with white glazed cotton, the bust lightly padded and the bodice fastens at the centre back with a narrow white silk ribbon at the neck and flat bronze hooks down the back, the eyes for which are missing. There is a bone at the centre front, others at the shaping seam and at the sides, and covered with white silk ribbon. The bodice seams are back-stitched and hand-finished, and those on the skirt are runned and felled.\n[Bodice] Bodice made in eight pieces with a centre front seam and a shaped bus panel at each side. With a wide pointed neckline, short straight sleeves and a deep point at the front waist. The sleeves are above elbow length and narrow. It fastens at the back.\n[Skirt] Skirt made of six full breadths with two half breadths arranged on either side of the back. Lined with white glazed cotton.",
