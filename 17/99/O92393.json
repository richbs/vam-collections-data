These were crack infantry units, originally composed of Algerians. They wore a colourful uniform and conducted a high-spirited and rapid form of drill. During the Crimean War, Zouave units served with the French army, allies of the British, against the Russians from 1854 to 1856.\n\nFenton\u2019s use of Zouave costume and the props of a tin mug and a gun demonstrate his close ties with the military. It also suggests his romantic conception of himself as that new figure of modernity, the war photographer. Fenton\u2019s photographs from the Crimea were made under Royal patronage. They were exhibited and published afterwards by Thomas Agnew & Co. of London. Fenton was later, in 1859, to develop a whole series of \u2018Orientalist\u2019 tableaux in his London studio. For these, he perhaps used costumes that he had acquired on his return journey from the Crimea.",
