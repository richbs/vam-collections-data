This view from the Prompt Corner backstage shows a glimpse of  the Totem-pole chorus girls in a scene from Rose Marie by Otto Harbach and Oscar Hammerstein Junior, with music by Rudolf Friml and Herbert Stothart. The musical opened in London at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane in March 1925 and ran there for 851 performances, after originally opening to rave reviews the previous September in New York.\n\nThe Redskin Totem-Pole Girls were one of the hits of the spectacular piece.  A chorus of over fifty girls danced the 'Totem Tom-Tom' number in colourful Redskin outfits seen here in black and white, topped with large hats resembling the carved animal heads on the totem poles on the set.  Reviewers at the time marvelled at the choreography of the number as the perfectly-drilled chorus of girls gyrated, swayed, leaned and fell in unison like a pack of cards or corns of ears blowing in the wind.",
