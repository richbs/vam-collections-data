Some of the images in the exhibition showed gentle scenes, such as bathing the baby, a family outing to the park, or playing at home.  Others went for the unvarnished truth, at least some of which was still considered fairly shocking when they were taken in the early 1980s - teenage parents with their baby, boys enjoying a quick cigarette on the bus to school.  Others again might be considered inappropriate for exhibition just twenty years later - boys playing with quite realistic-looking toy guns, or a naked child paddling in the sea.  This image is one of seventeen selected from the exhibits.",
