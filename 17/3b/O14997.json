Helen Angell (ne Coleman) was taught by her brother William; in return she assisted him with his decorative work for Minton's pottery. The practice of painting in watercolour continued to be seen as a genteel accomplishment for middle-class girls, on a par with embroidery, the piano and singing. Helen Angell's flower-piece is typical of this kind of semi-amateur work - competent, pleasing, modest and essentially unambitious. Nevertheless she enjoyed a distinguished career and was appointed official Flower Painter by Queen Victoria in 1879. The greatest professional success, it seems, was enjoyed by those women who worked within the genres of flower-painting, still life and domestic interiors - the subjects defined by the critics as suitably feminine.",
