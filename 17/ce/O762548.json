The earliest date occurring is \"April 27 1783\" ([View from) Margaritta's Window], and the latest, \"Oct 15 1824\" ([Study of trees at] Worcester). Amongst the many places indicated by name are Coleorton (Sir George Beaumont's residence, Oct 1806), Stratford upon Avon (Aug 4 1821), Rome (2 views March 1822, April 9, 1822), Road to Puzzioli, (2 views, each dated March 6 1822), Sienna (Nov. 1 1821). E.426 is interesting as being made \"From an Accidental blot of Indian Ink on a Palate,\" following the method (see \"A New Method of Assisting the Invention in Drawing Original Compositions of Landscape,\" 1788) of Alexander Cozens, who was drawing-master at Eton when Sir George Beaumont was there. The sketches, when received, were pasted on occasional sheets of a volume bearing the following inscription in ink on the front page \"Sketches of Sir George Beaumont | Given by Ly. Beaumont | to Elizth Susan Percy |1827.\" On the same page is written the name \"Eleanor.\" The sheets bore the watermark \"B. E. & S. 1823.\"\n<i>Pencil, pen and ink, and wash. Various sizes.\n</i>E.426 - 479-1926'",
