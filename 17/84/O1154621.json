An inscription at the lower right, 'Respectfully commissioned by the imperial prince Zhuang', attests to the fact that the painting was the product of the imperial workshop. Judging from the style, it was probably commissioned by the first holder of that title, the powerful Manchu prince Boggodo (1650\u20131723), whose grandfather Abahai (1592\u20131643) was the Qing dynasty's founder.",
