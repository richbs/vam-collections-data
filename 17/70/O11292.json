Although the painting of flowers and insects had been highly fashionable in Britian in the 18th century, it became popular again with the influx of Japanese art and artefacts from the mid-1860s onwards.  British artists and designers were encouraged to invent new versions of natural, asymmetrical and informal decoration, often using insects and wild flowers.\n\nSocial Class\nTablewares were an essential part of Minton's production throughout the 19th century and contributed significantly to the company's stability.  Ironstones, semi-porcelains, bone chinas and earthenwares were produced in vast quantities, reflecting the various styles in current use in the factory. Minton's bone china was recognised to be of exquisite quality and in the later 19th century the company established its reputation as a supplier of special services to the royal and aristocratic families of Europe.  This quality  was maintained throughout the bone china production, even if, as here, the decoration was rather less extravagant or the gilding less rich.",
