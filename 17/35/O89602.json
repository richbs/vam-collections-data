The relief terminates in a draped cloak. On the truncation of the left arm is incised CAL\u00dcK, for Carl-August L\u00fccke.\n\nOn the back of the frame, which is probably of the same date as the relief, is a label inscribed in old copperplate: Portrait of William Hogarth (1697-1764) the celebrated English Painter Anno 1764. This is the date of Hogarth's death. Nevertheless, the portrait may not represent Hogarth and the identification is not accepted by the National Portrait Gallery. Moreover the ivory is too early in date for the subject to be Hogarth.",

Since the pieces were limited in size the portraits tended to be small, yet they could still be monumental in form. This portrait of an unknown man was made by Carl August L\u00fccke the  Elder (active ca. 1688-1730). Little is known about this artist's life, though he probably  came from Dresden, and was one of a family of sculptors. He is likely to have been the father or uncle of Carl August L\u00fccke the Younger, and Johann Christoph Ludwig L\u00fccke. He was probably the brother of the sculptor Ernst Friedrich L\u00fccke (active ca. 1700).",
