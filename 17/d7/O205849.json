From the late 16th century onwards, Japanese men wore theinro suspended from their sash by a silk cord and a netsuke (toggle). They originally used it to hold their seal and ink or a supply of medicines. However, it rapidly became a costly fashion accessory of little or no practical use. Most inro are of rectangular flattened form with gently curving sides. \n\nLacquer was most commonly used in the manufacture of inro since it was highly suitable for storing medicines. Lacquer is the sap from the tree Rhus verniciflua that grows mainly in East Asia. After processing, it is applied in many thin layers to a base material, probably wood and paper in this example.  The craft of lacquering, as well as making inro bodies, is highly complex, time-consuming and expensive. This inrois made of lacquer imitating cloisonne enamel on a gold-sprinkled lacquer ground. This technique became popular after Japan was opened to the West in the late 19th century. It is also found on lacquer objects other than inro.",
