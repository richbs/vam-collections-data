Formed in 1970, the studio set out to create new contemporary designs in sterling silver. The small group of designers that formed its nucleus aimed to produce high-quality designs. They created a select band of products in batch production runs, with a strong emphasis on finely detailed design and workmanship. The silversmith created the distinctive textured surface you see here using punch dot decoration.\n\nThe husband and wife team of Tobia Scarpa (b.1935) and Afra Bianchin (b.1937), who designed this vase, both studied architecture in Venice. Their work shows a deep understanding of materials and empathy for traditional Italian craftsmanship. They have collaborated on designs for leading Italian manufacturers, including furniture for Gavina, lighting for Flos and cutlery for San Lorenzo. Architectural commissions include showrooms and factories (among them one for Benetton in 1964), and public spaces.",
