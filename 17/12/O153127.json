Cream satin ground with a small leafy lozenge lattice delineated in white; alternate compartments contain a simple rosette in silver-gilt or a short  four-line inscription in blue, red or silver-gilt, so forming vertical stripes.\nThe sleeve ends, neck band and front chest opening are faced with one or more roller-printed plain weave cottons: around the neck a rust red ground with a large chevron repeat of brown and white with brown and dark brown bands.  Also, but possibly from another fabric, a predominantly white roller-printed plain weave cotton bearing a rust red Greek Key band with a light brown 4-petalled rosette and down one side a series of thin red lines.  The sleeve cuffs, again roller-printed plain weave cotton in same colouring but patterned with a series of white diagonal stripes carrying small stylised floral elements.  On the left upper front there is an attached band/facing of dark blue plain weave silk with a series of narrow stripes, one plain, the others with a yellow chevron pattern with crimson red and light blue edging.  This carries a silk loop embellished with silver strip, while a conical button worked in silver thread is on the opposite side.\nOriginally the front panels from below the neck opening was decorated with tuck embroidered with  silver-gilt [31 cm long], of which only 8 cm survives.  This section is faced with roller-printed plain weave cotton in same colouring but patterned with a series of white diagonal stripes carrying small stylised floral elements [see sleeve cuffs].\nWarp: white silk\nWeft: white silk, Z-twist, red S-twist and blue Z-twist.\nMetal Thread: silver-gilt close Z-wound on yellow silk core.  The metal thread embroidered in the centre panel is silver-gilt strip on a bronze coloured silk core. The metal thread on the button is silver Z-wound on light beige silk.\nThere is one selvedge: one cord with two white stripes.\nSome panels at the sides are upside down.\nInside, at the level of the underarm gussets is a narrow white cotton tape which runs down the seams.",
