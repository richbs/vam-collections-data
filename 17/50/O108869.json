Designers working in this style were committed to honesty and simplicity in design, construction and materials. The solid form, restrained decoration and the thoughtful use of materials reflect these values.\n\nThis piece was made at the Daneway House Workshops, Gloucestershire. Ernest Barnsley and Ernest Gimson set up the workshops in 1893 to make Arts and Crafts furniture. These pieces often used traditional country methods and materials rather than more refined historical techniques. The rush used to make the seat was either harvested from British rivers during July, or imported from The Netherlands. It was an arduous and skilled job to weave rush seats by hand. The work was often undertaken by a specialist rush weaver, after the chairmaker, known as a bodger, had made the frame.",
