The stand rests on a low moulded base with five feet.  The dark wooden base is carved as waves. Represents the story of carps leaping up the Longmen rapids and turning into dragons.",

Thousands of carp would gather at Longmen and try to leap upstream. Those that succeeded without being carried downstream by the rapids would turn into dragons. \n\nThis vase represented best wishes for success to a candidate in the imperial civil examination. It expressed the hope that he could overcome all obstacles and come out ahead of his competitors.",
