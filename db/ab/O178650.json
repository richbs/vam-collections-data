Euphemia Gray had previously married the art critic, author, poet and artist, John Ruskin (1819-1900), in 1846.  Shortly after their marriage, however, Ruskin introduced Euphemia to his friend and proteg\u00e9e, Millais, and while Euphemia modelled for Millais' painting, The Order of Release (1853), she fell in love with him.  Ruskin had refused to connsumate his marriage and, despite having been married for several years, Euphemia was still a virgin.  In 1854, therefore, Euphemia annulled her marriage to Ruskin and married Millais the following year.  They had eight children, Mary their second daughter.  \n\nThe Millais family lived mostly in London but spent long summer holidays at Annet Lodge near Bowerswell, Perthshire.  Here, Millais executed many of his best known paintings and enjoyed the company of likeminded friends, including Rupert Potter (1832-1914), the father of the children's writer and illustrator, Beatrix Potter (1866-1943).  The Potters, too, retreated to Perthshire for the summer months, renting first Dalguise House, then later Eastwood, a large house on the bank of the Tay in Dunkeld.  An enthusiastic and skilled amateur photographer, Rupert photographed pleasant summer afternoons in the company of the Millais family; this photograph is one of several of Millais and his daughter, Mary, taken in 1881.  Although the photograph is inscribed '1879' it is identical to other photographs in the V&A's Linder Bequest inscribed September 1881 (see BP.1291).\n\nRupert also assisted Millais by photographing backgrounds for paintings and sitters for portraits.  Beatrix recounted one particularly memorable sitting in July 1884 when her father photographed the former prime minister, William Ewart Gladstone (1809-1898), for Millais\u2019 second portrait of him, completed in 1885: ' Papa has been photographing old Gladstone this morning at Mr. Millais'\u2026  They kept off politics of course, and talked about photography.  Mr. Gladstone talked of it on a large scale, but not technically.  What would it come to, how far would the art be carried, did papa think people would ever be able to photograph in colours?'
