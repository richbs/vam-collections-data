            "physical_description": "Robe and stomacher of brocaded silk with a cream ground and a horizontal woven zig-zag pattern with vertical stripes in maroon shading through to pink. The floral pattern is brocaded and consists of alternating large detached floral sprays curving round the vertical stripes. The flowers include shaded blue dog-roses, shaded pink ranunculus, maroon and pale blue tulips, yellow dog-roses, and maroon and pink michaelmas daisies.\n\nThe robe has an open front with an English back. There is a gathered pinked trimming of self-material on the neck and over the bodice robings, and a narrower pinked band down the fronts of the skirt. The sleeves have been lengthened to form close-fitting cuffs headed and edged with similar bands. The skirt is arranged in pleats over the back of the bodice. The bodice is lined with linen and the skirt is faced back with thin silk.\n\nThe stomacher is made from pieces of self-material. It has a straight top and a rounded point at the bottom. A vertical frill of self-material is stitched down the centre front. This frill is a different width from those trimming the robe and since it is graduated in size may have come from the previous petticoat. Lined with fine off-white lawn. The stomacher is stitched inside the robing and is fixed on the other side by flat brass metal hooks hooking into worked eyelets.\n\nThe robe may have been altered in the 1780s when the skirt was removed, the bodice was taken in at the sides, and the skirt was replaced. The cuffs were also altered, and their shape suggests a date around the 1770s. The stomacher may have been made in the 1780s or later.",
