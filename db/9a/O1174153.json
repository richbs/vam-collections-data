The event took place at the Albert Hall, Leeds (opened 1868) and was a charity performance in aid of the Leeds General Infirmary. The luxurious nature of the gold-fringed programme shows the minimal difference in the style of programmes produced for professional and amateur events in the nineteenth century.  This programme was made in London by the specialist perfumier, Eugene Rimmel, who produced a wide range of perfumed papers and material.  The \"Ethiopian Entertainment\" consisted of instumental and vocal numbers performed in the style of Black Face Minstrels.  The Minstrel Show, originating from the Negro patter songs of T.D. Rice, was the most popular form of entertainment in the United States from 1840 to 1880: it came to England in the 1840s where it soon established itself as respectable family fare, unlike the more vulgar Music Hall. Associated production: Ethiopian Entertainment. Rockingham Society Annual Festival, Albert Hall, Leeds, 27.1.1876.  Performance category: Music Hall / Variety.",
