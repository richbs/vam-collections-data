His work spans ballet, drama, film, musical, opera and revue. Messel\u2019s traditional style of theatre design became unfashionable from the mid 1950s onwards, and he increasingly concentrated on painting, interior and textile design, including designing luxury homes in the Caribbean.\n\nMessel\u2019s first post-war production was Sheridan\u2019s comedy of manners, The Rivals (1775). Performed at the Criterion Theatre in 1945, and directed by William Armstrong and Edith Evans, he designed costumes and sets in pastiche of eighteenth century period style.  The artificiality and lightness of his designs were well suited to the improbable plot and satiric spirit of the play.\n\nMessel designed a building fa\u00e7ade set model piece, with a bird cage just visible through one of the windows.  The doorway is designed in relief, with the pediment and base of columns cut out from wood attached to the fa\u00e7ade which is painted on card, a characteristically inventive combination of materials by Messel.",
