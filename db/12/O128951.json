American furniture-making was concentrated in the large cities of the eastern seaboard, each centre favouring particular forms and ornaments.  Both the form and the decoration of this chest of drawers suggest that it was made in New York State, as do certain features of its construction.  \n\nThe gadrooning to the skirt rail, the short claw-and-ball feet, and the unadorned squareness of the chest are all typical of New York furniture. The use of mouldings on the front edges of the dustboards (which separate the drawers from each other) is found in English furniture of the late seventeenth century, but in New York furniture-making is often seen in mid-eighteenth-century pieces.  The solid dustboards (rather than open frames), made of poplar, are another characteristic New York feature.",

Mr Bergen also gave Asian ceramics to the Museum.  The following notes, in a memo to Ralph Edwards, Keeper of Furniture and Woodwork, from someone sighning themselves CMW, came with the donation:\n\n\u2018His grandfather, Teunis G. Bergen wrote a genealogy of the Bergen family, published by Joel Munsell, Albany, N.Y., in 1876. The family\u2019s ancestor, Hans Hansen Bergen, who arrived in New Amsterdam from Bergen, Norway, in 1633, married the first girl to be born in the colony. \n\nMr Bergen\u2019s old family home (which I was shown by a friend of his in July 1939) was a weather-boarded house , Shaw Road and 77th Street, Bay Ridge, Brooklyn.\n\nHis father acquired most of the furniture.  \n\nThe chest is very similar to one in the New York State Museum (H-1970.37.1) attributed to Antonio Jacobsen and M.
