During the residency she made around 50 drawings, many based on plant forms, seeds, insects etc. She worked on papers that had themselves been subjected to various natural processes - some she buried for several days, others were exposed to insects and other animals which left marks and other physical traces, all of which became part of the drawing and the life cycle of the work.\n\nThe work from the residency was exhibited in 2000, and this portfolio was published (in 2 versions) as a catalogue to the exhibition. This limited edition (number 17 or 40) version contains an original lithograph, as well as reproductions of 6 of the drawings, and an essay by Hugh Stoddart.",
