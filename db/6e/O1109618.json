He was probably influenced by the definitely almond-shaped eyes of the companion portrait (Cat. No. 201), but Long was unimpressed. He wondered in an undated note in the department file whether the two miniatures could be early works of the artist then called Lawrence Crosse, but his firm published opinion was simply 'Unknown British'. There have been no further suggestions; the hand is indeed unfamiliar, clumsy and outside the quality range for Court miniatures of this date. \n\nThe portrait is a variant of the type invented by Lely for William's marriage to Mary in 1677. The prime version is thought to be that at Syon House, represented by a copy in the NPG. (2) The same basic pose, with an updated head and the Garter ribbon, was revived by Wissing in 1685 (perhaps on the order of 'James II). (3) Long and subsequent cataloguers identified the present miniature with the Wissing, but, with the younger face and lacking the Garter ribbon, the miniature belongs more closely to the Lely, and therefore to c.1677. \n\nRichard Gibson, who had been drawing master to the daughters of the Duke of York, went with Princess Mary to Holland on her marriage to Prince William in 1677. But his style, and that which he would have passed on to pupils, bears no resemblance to the style here. \n\n1 Quoted in Long 1923. \n2 Piper 1963, pp. 377-8, pl. 18a. \n3 Millar 1963, vol. I, no. 321, vol. II, pl. 137.\" \n\n",
