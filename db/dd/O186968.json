            "physical_description": "Quiver, leather embroidered with silk in straight stitches.\nThe left hand side is straight; it has a deep curved opening along the top extending up the right hand side. The right hand side curves in towards the bottom which ends in a slight point. The back is plain leather.  An additional piece of leather has been added in the top left hand corner. When viewed from the back, extra strips of leather have been inserted along the left hand seam. A small slit has been made in the top and a strip of leather has been inserted and knotted to form a loop.  The base of the quiver is open and there are no signs that it was ever closed with stitching.  The front has been embroidered to shape with the stitches going through the leather. There is a narrow border all round with dark green and dark red S-lines.  The design begins at the bottom with flowering stems which sweep around a diagonal cypress tree which has an ornamental 'root' and which is filled with flowers.  Around the cypress tree are more leaves and flowers including carnations. The colours used are red, dark green, light green, pink, light blue.\nA strip of leather has been sewn around the lower left hand side and the bottom.  A section of leather has been added to the upper left hand side - both these obscure some of the embroidery.  An additional piece of leather on the right hand side appears to have been original because the strap/loop goes through it and the embroidered pattern seems to accommodate it.",
