At either side of the panel is a tall Corinthian column bearing trophies and thirteen engravings of the ensigns and standards captured in the battle. The name of the regiment or brigade to which each flag belonged is printed underneath it, with a few exceptions, and the number of similar flags captured is beside each one illustrated. Above these columns at either side are trophies of war surrounding, on the left, winged Fame blowing a trumpet, and on the right is Britannia. Above the inscription are more trophies with bound and naked captives to either side of a medallion containing a half length portrait of Queen Anne, and flying cupids with a palm of victory and trumpet from which hangs a banner with the monogram 'A R'.\n\nBeneath the inscriptions is a diagrammatic view of the battle with Marlborough in the foreground on a horse. Below that is another group of standards and armour around a crowned cartouche bearing the royal monogram. Along the bottom are further areas of print explaining name and posts of officers, regiments which surrendered prisoners, an explanation of colours, and an explanation of the Battle.\n\nThe handkerchief is printed in black on white silk from an engraved plate.",
