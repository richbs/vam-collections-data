It was donated to the V&A by the Computer Arts Society, and may have been included in a CAS exhibition entitled Creative Computers, which toured the UK in 1971-2. The exhibition included works by Antonio Berni, Ernesto Deira (or Delva, according to the catalogue), Ango Demarco, Osvaldo Romberg and Miguel Vidal. All of them were involved in the Centro de Arte y Comunicaci\u00f3n (CAYC, or the Art and Communication Centre) in Buenos Aires, Argentina.  CAYC's members were concerned with the link between art and technology, and, in particular, with the use of systems in the production of art work. \n\nA similar print by Mac Entyre was exhibited at the Tendencies 5 exhibition in Zagreb in 1973.",
