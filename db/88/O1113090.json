The character seen here is Rosalind from As You Like It who dresses in male clothes as Ganymede when she is banished into the Forest of Arden. The plate was made by Royal Doulton, probably in the 1930s.\n\nRoyal Doulton began in Lambeth, London, in 1815 when John Doulton manufactured ceramic items such as stoneware bottles and sewer pipes. The Victorian revolution in hygiene and sanitation ensured its success, and Doulton later produced tableware and commemorative items.  The film moved to Burslem in the Potteries in 1882, and added porcelain to their production two years later. It was granted a Royal Warrant in 1901.",
