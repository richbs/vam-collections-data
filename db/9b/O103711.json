The silversmith created the pierced decoration you see here using a chisel to punch out the pattern. \n\nBread baskets, also known as fruit or cake baskets, were particularly popular items of tableware throughout the period 1700-1800. They were usually circular, oval or boat-shaped with an everted (turned-out) rim and a high arched, bail handle which was sometimes fixed but more often hinged.  The sides were decorated by piercing, as here, or die stamping or a combination of both techniques. The basket usually rested on a supporting rim with similar decoration.",
