Exhibited 65 works at the RA in 1830 and between 1837 and 1879, 13 at the BI 1830-44, and 13 (including one watercolour) at the SBA 1830-41. Sent works from Southampton 1833-5, otherwise resident in London. Subjects were rustic genre, and, by contrast, historical and literary, often of a grim nature. Made reputation as history painter with the powerful 'Solomon Eagle ... ' (1843, Graves Art Gallery, Sheffield). Won prize in Westminster Hall competition 1847. Elected ARA 1846, RA 1861. Also painted in watercolours; elected Member of Royal Institute of Painters in Watercolours 1878. From 1830 lived with Francis Danby's wife whom he married very soon after Danby's death in 1861. Died Hampstead, London, 22 September 1879; his studio sale was at Christie's 8 May 1880. \nLIT: <u>Art Journal</u>1859, pp-l l-d; <u>Illustrated London News</u> 23 February 1861, pp175-6 (With engr portrait); <u>Athenaeum</u> 27 September 1879, p408 (obit);<u> Art Journal</u>1879, pp263, 278 (obit); <u>Graphic </u>18 October 1879, p376 (engr portrait); Winter Exhibition catalogue, RA 1884; \nR Garnett 'A Hampstead Painter: the late Paul Falconer Poole RA' <u>Hampstead Annual </u>1900, pp9-24; F Greenacre<u> The Bristol School of Artists </u>...

Such works must have been popular with dealers and collectors, certainly more popular than his large historical and literary scenes (see for example the provenance of 'The Death of Cordelia', p231). Garnett (p 12) also discussed these works, commenting that the landscape was 'always an important element in the picture, linked to the figures by some subtle bond of spiritual affinity'. Poole may have based his compositions on 'The Swiss Peasant' by Henry Howard RA, engraved by Charles Heath for the second volume of the 1836 <u>Gallery of British Engravings </u>(possibly after Howard's 1814 RA exhibit 'Swiss Peasants'). \nTwo examples were engraved in the 1859 <u>Art Journal</u>- 'Crossing the Stream' and 'The Mountain Spring'; another 'Crossing the Stream', and 'The Gleaner', are in the Royal Holloway College collection (see J Chapel <u>Victorian Taste</u> 1982, ppl24-5; see also 'At the Spring' sold Sotheby's 29 \nMarch 1984 (177)). There are also a great number of watercolours of rustic scenes depicting a woman and child dating from the later 1830s and the 1840s. The <u>Art Journal</u> obituary described such subjects as 'always sweet, simple, and tender'; Graham Reynolds calls them 'routine pieces, smiling country girls with their children posed against the rocky streams of the West Country' (<u>Victorian Painting </u>1966, p142). \nPROV: Collection of Charles Birch, Westfield House, Edgbaston, Birmingham, sold Forter's 15 February 1855 (VII, engr in cat by W Thomas as 'mountain peasants descending the rugged path', 24 by 20 inches), bought Gambart \u00a3252; possibly sold at Christie's (Agnew's Galleries, Liverpool) 5 December 1861 (280, as 'The Mountain Path', 'a work of the highest quality'), bought Beaumont \u00a3204 15s. \n\n\nRonald Parkinson\"",
