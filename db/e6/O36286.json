It is the stylized form of the horse and carriage mounted on a flat base which in turn is on four wheels held to a static axle by wooden pegs. The horse is painted when with blue; orange; green and black decoration representing flowers and bunches of straw for the mane and tail. The carriage and shafts are painted orange with blue; dark red; yellow; green; white and black floral decorations. The base is painted yellow with orange; white; green and black decorations. The ends of the axles are yellow and the wheels painted orange with black markings; the pegs are also orange. The horse and carriage are\nnailed to the base; the shafts are nailed to the horse at one end and the carriage at the other. \nThis toy was made to traditional designs and it would have been\nsold to the Co-operative group for sale. Although the area co-operatives have been replaced there is still no credit given to an actual maker.",
