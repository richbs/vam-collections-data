Studied with John Cawse, entered RA Schools 1835. Studied in Rome in studio of neoclassicist Filippo Agricola 1836-9, visiting Paris, Venice, and studying fresco painting with Peter Cornelius in Munich. Won prize in Westminster Hall competition 1843, commissioned to paint corridor in House of Commons 1853. Exhibited 86 works at the RA between 1834 and 1877, 16 at the BI 1834-43, and 11 at the SBA 1835-77. Subjects mostly historical and literary, particularly 17th-century English and late l8th-century French. Elected ARA 1846, RA 1855. Popular and much admired, several of his works were engraved. Died Windsor, Berkshire, 15 January 1879; his studio sale was at Christie's 29 March 1879. His wife Henrietta Ward, of the other, more famous, Ward family, was also an historical painter; their five children were artists, notably Sir Leslie Ward, the caricaturist 'Spy'. \n\nLIT: \tArt Union 1847, p260; Illustrated London News, xxvi, 31 March 1855, pp301-2 (engr portrait); Art Journal 1855, pp45-8; Magazine of Art 1878, p18; The Times 17, 18, 19 January 1879 (obit); Athenaeum 25 January 1879, pp128-9 (obit); Art Journal l879, pp72-3, 84 (obit with engr portrait); J Dafforne The Life and Works of E M Ward 1879; ed \nE O'Donnell Mrs E M Ward's Reminiscences 1911 \n\nJohn Forster in his Study \nP74-1935 Neg R2855 \nCanvas, 63.5 X 76.1 cm (25 X 30 ins) Purchased 1935 \nOn the back of the stretcher a manuscript label reads 'John Forster in his study - painted by - Ward R.A for himself: bought by Mr Forster - finished later by Mr Downard'. It is not known in what circumstances Ebenezer Newman Downard (exhibiting 1849-89) came to finish the portrait. For fuller details of the sitter, see Daniel Maclise's portrait (P35-1935, p184). Ward was involved with Forster and Charles Dickens in the dramatic performances in aid of the Guild of Literature and Art (see R Renton John Forster and His Friendships 1912, pp70--1) in the years around 1850. The present portrait probably dates from about the same time. Between 1834 and 1856 Forster lived at 58 Lincoln's Inn Fields. \nThe larger of the two paintings on the wall behind the sitter is the copy formerly ascribed to Sir Thomas Lawrence of Van Dyck's 'Earl of Strafford and His Secretary', included in the Forster bequest to the museum (FI9). Forster's 'metamorphic' library chair, which converts into steps, dates from 1811 and was discussed in Country Life (20 September 1920, pxxxiv). The portrait bust on the right has not been identified; it does not seem to represent Dickens, but could be Thackeray (compare the broad nose with, for example Frank Stone's portrait of about 1839 in the NPG). \nIn a letter to Forster in 1856, Lord Lytton recorded 'Ah, those memories of Lincoln's Inn Fields ... You with your strong forehead bowed over that relentless Examiner [of which Forster was editor from 1847 to 1856] table. Macready glaring at you across the witch's cauldron, and Dolly Varden holding her pretty sides and laughing behind you' (quoted by Lady Betty Balfour Personal and Literary Letters of Robert first Earl of Lytton 2 vols, 1906). For the latter painting, see under Frith (F8); the former is presumably Maclise's portrait of Macready as Werner (F21). \nWard also painted portraits of Dickens in his study (1854), and of another member of the group, Maclise (1856); he seems to have specialised in such 'study' portraits, and other exhibited examples include Thorwaldsen (1841), Thackeray (1844), Macaulay (1853), Lord Lytton (1854), and Hallam (1858). \nPROV: \tBy descent to Miss Fanny Crosbie (John Forster's niece); bought from Charles J Sawyer Ltd (With 75-1935, anonymous miniature portrait of Forster) \u00a340 \nEXH: \tCharles Dickens Victoria and Albert Museum 1970 (DI5) \n\nRonald Parkinson\"\nVictoria and Albert Museum <u>Charles Dickens: An exhibition to celebrate the centenary of his death</u> London: HMSO, 1970.

Too busy to spend much time in the British Museum Reading Room he now began to build up his own fine library in his rooms at 58 Lincoln's Inn Fields, where he moved in 1834, and by 1840 he had laid claim on the English Republic as the special subject of his historical studies, contributing to Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopaedia (1836-39) several lives of the statesmen of the Commonwealth, which appeared in a collected edition in 1840.'",
