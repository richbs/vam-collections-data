The two angels originally formed two halves of the top of a lancet (pointed) window in a chapel on the north side of the choir. In its present state the window is a mixture of medieval glass and 19th-century replacements. This is often the case with surviving medieval windows, because of losses over time and deliberate destruction. In the 19th century, many churches in France were restored and some surviving medieval glass was removed and replaced by copies. \n\nBecause of this restoration work we do not know the original subject matter of the window that these angels came from. It seems to represent some episodes from the lives of both St  Peter and St  Paul. In its present state the central image at the top of the window has an image of Christ seated, holding the keys that he gave to St Peter. The angels in the present window are copies.",

The window in its present state is a mixture of medieval glass and 19th century replacements. This is often found in surviving medieval windows as much has been lost over time and by deliberate destruction. In the 19th century, many churches in France were restored and some surviving medieval glass was removed and replaced by copies. \n\nBecause of this restoration work the original iconography of the window that these angels came from is not as clear. It seems to represent some episodes from the lives of both St. Peter and St. Paul. In its present state the central image at the top of the window has an image of Christ seated, holding the keys which he gave to St.Peter. The angels in the present window are copies.",
