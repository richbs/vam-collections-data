The mounts are of a later date in the 19th century, which suggests that the mother of pearl panels are reused, and may have originally decorated a small cabinet.  That the panels were not necessarily in this configuration may also explain the mix of the mythological scene of Perseus and Andromeda, with the Old Testament scenes of Susanna and the Elders, David and Bathsheba, Judith with the head of Holefernes, and Joseph with Potiphars's wife.  It is likely that initially there were more than five panels.\n\nSir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver,  mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes.  Arthur Gilbert donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.",
