However, when I started sculpting its shape with clay, I was drawn into its intimacy; the manner in which veins were branching, how the margins ended. I found many details that I admired in this small leaf. ... It is my intention to transfer the leaf's beauty and detail into my ceramic work, using it as my own language to weave new stories for objects'.\n\nHosono's unique mode of working was inspired by the experience she gained of sprig-moulding during a placement at the Wedgwood Factory while she was an MA Ceramics and Glass student at the Royal College of Art (2007-2009).",
