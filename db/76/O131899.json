            "historical_context_note": "This painting is based on a signed work by Peter Monamy in the National Maritime Museum (<i>A Man-of-War Firing a Gun at Sundown</i>, BHC1003). The main elements of the composition, with a two-deck, man-of-war on the right and a beached hoy, a type of coasting vessel, in the left-foreground, are broadly similar. There are however, subtle variations for example, in the rigging of the larger vessels, in the hoy with its surrounding figures and in the smaller barges and distant vessels of both works. When writing about a similar painting by Monamy in the Metropolitan Museum (<i>Harbour Scene: An English Ship with Sails Loosened Firing a Gun</i>, 60.94.2) Katharine Baetjer notes that this type of composition is typical of Monamy, as is the small barge with the orderly repetition of rowers pulling away from the ship\u2019s stern and the profile of the ship\u2019s stern silhouetted against plumes of smoke (Katharine Baetjer, <i>British Paintings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1575-1875</i>, 2009, pp.34-36). 139-1883 is signed in the lower, left corner, with the abbreviation \u2018F.S\u2019 and the \u2018S\u2019 has a looped flourish.\n\nThe influence of Peter Monamy on Francis Swaine\u2019s style has been noted and has led to an unfounded tradition that the latter worked in Monamy\u2019s studio (see Stephen Deuchar, \u2018Francis Swaine\u2019, <i>Oxford Art Online</i>).",
