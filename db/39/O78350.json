The bubble of glass with long neck was also the quickest and cheapest container that could be made by a glass-blower.\n\nTime\nThe invention of the dark-green 'black' bottle coincided with the Restoration of Charles II in 1660 and a period of great prosperity and social climbing. An obvious way to impress guests at the dining table was to serve wine from bottles bearing one's name, coat of arms or crest. These applied stamped seals or medallions were clearly inspired by those on  imported German stoneware bottles, which the new wine bottles were largely replacing.\n\nDesign & Designing\nThe form of the 'shaft and globe' wine bottle was dictated largely by its function: the heavy base, with pushed-in recessed 'kick', made the object stable and was almost indestructable, while the vulnerable neck was reinforced by a 'string rim' of applied glass that enabled the cork to be secured with thread or wire. So ideal was this vessel for its purpose that echoes of its main characteristics may be seen in any modern wine bottle, although after the mid-18th century the cylindrical bottle, designed to be stored flat, became the standard form.",
