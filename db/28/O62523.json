He was much admired in mainland Europe, promoted alongside Baillie Scott and C.R. Mackintosh. Most of Walton\u2019s textile designs have special relevance to the interiors he designed and were used, like the stencilled linen seen here, as wall hangings. This example was used in Elm Bank House, a house that Walton decorated for Sidney Leetham on the Mount leading to Knavesmire in York.",
