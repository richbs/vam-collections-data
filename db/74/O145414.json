In 1888 he became a publisher in his own right with offices at 24 St. Bride Street, London. He appointed the writer and editor, Robert Ellice Mack, as director. \n\nNister specialised in high quality colour printing for children in the last quarter of the 19th century. Movable books with various mechanisms became his speciality after 1890 (when be published his first stand-up book) but he also produced numerous picture books, annuals, poetry, nursery rhymes, calendars and greetings cards. He worked with a core of writers, including Clifton Bingham and Robert Ellice Mack, and illustrators such as Eveline Lance, Harriett M. Bennett, Edith A. Cubitt and Rosa Petherick. \n\nHarriett M. Bennett's watercolour drawing, 'The First Violet', illustrates verses by Edith Nesbit in Old Father Time and his Twelve Children, edited by Robert Ellice Mack and published by Ernest Nister, ca.1891.",
