            "public_access_description": "Earthenware flatbacks and figurines for mantelpiece decoration were first produced in  Staffordshire in the late 1830s. The earliest datable Staffordshire figures appear to be those of Queen Victoria, who was crowned in 1837.  Images of royalty proved lucrative and during the 1840s there were countless royal figures issued by Staffordshire pottery firms, celebrating for example Victoria's marriage to Prince Albert in 1840, and the birth of the royal children. Although a few Staffordshire portrait figures were produced after Victoria's death in 1901, few appear to have been produced after 1905. During their heyday however they were produced in vast numbers, usually modelled after prints. As well as the royal family they represented a wide variety of subjects, those of actors and actresses being especially popular.\n\nAlthough no engraved source has been identified for this figure, it has been suggested that it represents Pericles in Shakespeare's tragedy Pericles, Prince of Tyre which was revived by Samuel Phelps at Sadler's Wells in October 1854, with Phelps as Pericles. With its long and complicated plot, the play had not been produced for two hundred years but Phelps gave it a spectacular production which ran for two months.  Pericles has to solve a riddle; he also reads a letter from the Princes of Tyre in the play, so this may well depict one of those episodes. A companion piece was issued showing a woman leaning on an urn, which may represent Edith Heraud who played Marina. This figure was a birthday present to Robert Eddison from Peggy Ashcroft for his 43rd birthday in June 1951.",

An accompanying note rolled into the urn, referred to the respective roles played by Peggy Ashcroft and Robert Eddison in the 1950-1951 Old Vic season and is signed with the initials of the parts played by Peggy Ashcroft, Viola, Page and Electra. During that season Robert Eddison played Sebastian in <i>Twelfth Night</i>, Orestes in <i>Electra</i> and Sir Andrew Aguecheek in <i>Merry Wives</i>, which explains Peggy Ashcroft's description of herself as 'some time sister, prospective (abortive) mother-in-law and rival'.",
