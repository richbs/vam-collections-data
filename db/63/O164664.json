Pendentive cornice, two stalactite brackets, and parts of a ceiling, partly coloured and gilt, from a house in the H\u00e1rat-er-R\u00fam, at Cairo. The original Saracenic, 15th century.\n\nBought from the collection of Gaston de St Maurice (1831-1905). Plaster casts numbered 1020-1884 to 1046-1884 were bought for a  total of \u00a360.\n\nOriginally 1030 to 1030i were acquired. Parts A, B, D, H and I were written off (destroyed) in 1934. See RP/33/2518.\n\nThese large plaster casts come from a house in the Harat al-Rum quarter in Cairo, possibly called the Qasr Rumi. They probably come from the same house as a Mamluk stone porch, also in the St Maurice collection and subsequently sold to the Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs in Paris; in 2012 this was reconstructed and installed in the Islamic Galleries at the Louvre. A number of drawings of the porch while it was still in situ in Cairo, drawn by the French architect Jules Bourgoin (1838-1908) while he was in Cairo between 1880 and 1884, are labelled 'Kasr Rumy' (Qasr Rumi, 'Palace of the Christian') and 'GSM' for 'Gaston de St Maurice'.\n\nAccording to Daskalakis Mathews 2012 (p.16) Harat al-Rum was a quarter in the city of Cairo located next to the Bab Zuwayla. It was the principal quarter of the Greek Orthodox community and residence of its patriarch. In the 19th century, Copts also lived here as well as some Muslims. Qasr Rumi may have been the main house of the quarter. It was likely destroyed during urban redevelopments in the late 19th century.\n\n<u>Collecting context:\n</u>\nThe V&amp;A holds approximately 200 objects from the collection of the Comte Gaston de St Maurice (1831-1905). St Maurice was a French aristocrat working in  Cairo for some 20 years as equerry to the Khedive (Ottoman governor) of Egypt.  During that period, St Maurice accumulated a large collection of historic objects  from Islamic Egypt, dating especially from the 14th-16th centuries but also  including some 19th-century objects. His tastes ranged widely and his collection  included works of art from Syria, Iran, India, East Asia, as well as Europe. These  objects were installed, some of them as furnishings, in the maison arabe built for  him between 1872 and 1879 by the French architect Ambroise Baudry (1838- 1906), who designed several houses for prominent French ex-patriates in Egypt.  Part of the decoration of St Maurice\u2019s house included plaster casts taken from a  variety of historic buildings across Cairo, especially those built during the reign of  Sultan Qa\u2019itbay (r.1468-96). \n\nSt Maurice exhibited his collection at the 1878 Paris Exposition, where it was seen  and its quality commented on by curators from the South Kensington Museum  (now the V&amp;A). After the exhibition, St Maurice\u2019s collection remained in Paris, on  deposit in the Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs. Due to the increasing political instability  in Egypt, culminating with the British occupation (in 1882), St Maurice tried to sell  his collection to the South Kensington Museum. The price was considered too  high, but part of the collection was received on loan in 1883, the remainder staying  in Paris at the Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs. Eventually in 1884, the loaned objects  from St Maurice were bought by South Kensington. Stanley Lane-Poole (1854- 1931), Arabist and external advisor to South Kensington on \u2018Saracenic art\u2019,  considered this collection to be \u201cof the greatest value and rarity\u201d.",
