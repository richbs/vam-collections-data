It functioned both as a sunshade and a fashionable accompaniment to dress, distinguishing itself from the umbrella through its infinite and luxurious forms and essentially feminine status. Like the earlier trend for fans parasols displayed an individual's style and could be used in a coquettish ritual to hide the modest bearer from unwanted glances\n\nParasols of the 1820s and 30s were large, typically with a diameter of almost a meter when fully open. This example with its popular pagoda shape is typical of its time displaying an elaborately carved ivory handle in a hook shape, a green silk cover and a brass collar on the handle with the decorative motif a crown with 'London' written underneath. The complex reversible weave of the silk allows the floral design to be seen on the inside and outside of the cover. An ivory ring attached to the cover slides down when shut to keep the parasol closed, enabling it to be held upside down.",
