Carpenter's idea for a bedroom in plate 76, and looks more like a typical middle-class bedroom of the 1930s and 1940s. The traditional furniture combines mid-Georgian features with the clean lines, motifs and rich colouring of Art Deco. The modern plainness of the period-style panelled walls contrast with the startling strong blue of the carpet, recalling Far Eastern ceramics, emphasised by the decorative vase on the window sill. The rest of the decoration also has an oriental feel, with the rug (unusually laid onto a carpet) and the shiny silk coverlet. Shiny surfaces were an important feature of 1930's interiors, and are picked out here in the pouffe, cushion and furniture. The modified historical revival 'Chippendale' chairback and the cabriole legs of the wardrobe are contrasted with the tiered Art Deco profile of the bed-head.\"\n",
