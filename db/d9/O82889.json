This has been described as being probably one of the Jinas, intended to be placed on a swing in a Jain shrine or possibly intended to represent the father of the last of the Jain Tirthankaras, Siddhartha. Alternatively the figure may represent a Hindu saint. It has been proposed that it may represent Sundararmurti, a South Indian Shaivite saint. He appears either to be nude, with the genitalia not depicted, or to wear a loin cloth. He wears two bracelets, detachable, on each wrist.  One is in the form of a chain, the other is a penannular ring. He sits on a lotus-base with legs bent and forward in balance to the motion of the swing. The upraised  right hand  and the down turned left make indeterminate hastas.\nOn the back is incised a six-pointed star of the 'Star of David' type in a circle, with one or possibly two Tamil characters incised within the centre of the star and on the left side within the circle.",
