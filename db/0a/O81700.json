They come from Iznik, north-west Anatolia, and are thought to have been made in a workshop run by a 'Master of the Knots'. \n\nThe colours of the decoration help to date this piece. White on a blue ground had been the main colour scheme since production started in Iznik around 1470. In the 1520s Iznik potters stopped using white on a blue ground and blue decoration on a white ground took its place. This shift to decoration in blue on a white ground can be seen on the outside of this basin. Here, the line-like scrolls carry enormous blossoms with imaginary forms. At the same time, potters expanded the range of colours to include turquoise. Later black, sage-green and purple were introduced.",
