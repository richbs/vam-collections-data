He was educated at University College School, University College London (BA, 1861 and LLB with honours). He married Edith Jane Durning Smith in 1874, the daughter and co-heiress of politician John Benjamin Smith.\nDuring 1867, Durning-Lawrence was called to Middle Temple and also was a member of the Metropolitan Board of Works for a short time, as well as a Lieutenant for the City of London and a Justice of the Peace in Berkshire. He was elected as Liberal Unionist member of Parliament for Truro in 1895; a position he held until 1906. Durning-Lawrence's main interest was literature, especially the Bacon/ Shakespeare controversy; he was the author of <u>Bacon is Shakespeare</u> (1910) and <u>The Shakespeare Myth</u> (1912).  In 1901 he gave to the V&A thirteen paintings, museum numbers 620 to 633-1901.\n\nHistorical significance: A note on the Departmental File states, \"When exhibited (1959) in Room 120 [V&A], it was decided to label 625-1901 'English School, c.1800'.  It seems to have nothing to do with Morland\".  Unfortunately, referreing to V&A catalogues dating from the early part of the 20th century, the <u>Victoria & Albert Museum, Summary Catalogue of British Paintings</u>, 1973, repeated the older description of this painting as \"Follower of George Morland\", which in turn has been repeated in <u>The Public Catalogue Foundation: Oil Paintings in Public Ownership: The Victoria & Albert Museum</u> (2008), p.223.  The reattribution of 1959 should however stand.  This image does not share any significant qualities with the work of George Morland and should not be associated with that artist.",
