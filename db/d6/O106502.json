It was revived in Europe during the Renaissance, and again in the 18th and 19th centuries.  Cameos and intaglios were prized and collected, sometimes as symbols of power and mounted in jewelled settings, sometimes as small objects for private devotion or enjoyment. This gem is in the neo-classical style popular in the late 1700s and early 1800s, when taste in the arts echoed the subject matter and style of the Greek and Roman masters. Thousands of gems were made in this style in Italy and brought back by British Grand Tourists, who went there to visit the newly-discovered classical antiquities and archaeological sites.  In Greek mythology Niobe, wife of the king of Thebes, was punished for boastfulness by the gods Apollo and Diana who killed all her children.  Versions of this type of head appear on several cameos and echo that of one of the daughters of Niobe (Niobids) in a Greek sculpture of around 440 BC now in the Museo Nazionale, Rome, in which she is shown struck in the back by an arrow as she flees the massacre.",

Although the gemstone collection is not as comprehensive as that found at the Natural History Museum, it is of particular historic interest as its formation pre-dates the development of many synthetic stones and artificial enhancements. All the stones were mounted as rings before they came to the Museum.  Some are held in the Sculpture Section, other more elaborately mounted ones in the Metalwork Section.\n\nAs well as being a clergyman, collector and dillettante, the Reverend Townshend wrote poetry.  He met Robert Southey in 1815 and through him the Wordsworths, the Coleridges and John Clare.  He was a friend of Charles Dickens and dedicatee of his novel 'Great Expectations'.",

Many were brought back by British Grand Tourists, and important collections were formed.
