Studied with his maternal uncle W F Witherington RA and at the RA Schools. Exhibited 50 works at the RA between 1839 and 1875, and six at the BI 1841--47. Subjects were mythological, biblical and literary (especially Shakespeare and Spenser), and influenced primarily by Etty. Won prizes in the Westminster Hall competitions 1843 and 1847. Elected ARA 1847 (at a very young age), RA 1857, Keeper 1873. Retired 1888 and moved to Yarmouth, Isle of Wight, where he died 20 December 1900. His cousin Henry Hall Pickersgill (see entry below) and uncle Henry William Pickersgill RA were also artists. \nLIT: Art Journal1850, p108, 1855, pp233-6 \n\nAndrea Mantegna \n28-1873 \nCanvas, 265.5 X 88.9 cm (104\u00bd X 35 ins) Inscribed 'F R Pickersgill RA' br \nTransferred to the Department 1921 \nFor details of the history and circumstances of the commission see under Richard Burchett 1762-1869, p14. \nThe design was translated into English ceramic mosaic by Florence H Cole and Mary J Jennings of the South Kensington mosaic class, superintended by Samuel Cooper of Minton, Hollins and Company; it cost \u00a3120 and was finished in 1871. A design had originally been prepared by Edward H Wehnert, but was not accepted (also in the V&A collections, 1144-1868; see also Pickersgill's commission, 127-1885 below). Wehnert's design is more elaborate, showing accessories which refer to Mantegna's interests in painting, classical sculpture, and geometry; the present work includes only a classical relief. Neither portrait seems to relate to the Mantegna self-portrait - the 'gigantic head' - in the Ovetari Chapel, Padua (see R Lightbown Mantegna 1986, cat no 1, fig 8). The present work now hangs as part of the decoration of the Lecture Theatre. There is a full-size copy in oil in the Queen's Park Art Gallery, Manchester. \nLIT: \tJ Physick The Victoria and Albert Museum: the history of its building 1982, pp62-7. \n\nRonald Parkinson\"\n'Mosaics in the South Kensington Museum, <i>The Illustrated London News.</i> 30 March 1867 John Physick, <i>The Victoria and Albert Museum: the history of its building,</i> London: V&A Publications (1982) pp. 62-69.

            "history_note": "Commissioned for the decoration of the South Court of the South Kensington Museum\n\nHistorical significance: Andrea Mantegna (1430/31-1506) was an Italian painter and printmaker. A passion for the antique is evident in all his work, and he was one of the first artists to collect Greek and Roman works. He was a rigorous draughtsman and anatomist. Mantegna was appointed court painter to the Gonzaga, and was employed by three generations of the family. As well as large-scale paintings, he also produced banners, tableware and decorations. For the Gonzaga he painted his famous frescoes in the <i>Camera degli Sposi</i> of the Gonzaga palace, Mantua. His illusion of a dome opening to the sky was widely imitated in the Baroque period. Among his late works are nine large canvases of the Triumph of Caesar (1486-94; Hampton Court). Mantegna's religious scenes and classical compositions were engraved, allowing his work to become known throughout Europe. \n\nIn this portrait Mantegna holds a fragmentary classical relief sculpture, a reference to his abiding interest in antiquity.\n\nA specialist in historical genre painting, Frederick Richard Pickersgill (1820-1900) entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1839. He exhibited 50 works at the RA between 1839 and 1875. His subjects were mythological, biblical and literary. He won prizes in the Westminster Hall competitions 1843 and 1847. He was elected ARA in 1847 (at a young age), becoming a full Academician in 1850. He became Keeper of the Royal Academy Schools in 1873, a post he held until 1887. \n\nIn 1869 Pickersgill was commissioned to produce a large overdoor painting for the National Competition Gallery in the South Kensington Museum, showing the distribution of art prizes (Valentine Prinsep was commissioned to paint its pair). Two years later he was commissioned to design a lunette fresco for the Museum on the subject of <u>The Industrial Arts in the Time of Peace</u>. He painted a large oil painting (127-1885) and a full-scale crayon design (128-1885) for the lunette, but in the end a design by Leighton was preferred and Pickersgill's fresco was never executed.",

            "historical_context_note": "Commissioned between 1862 and 1871, the 'Kensington Valhalla' (so named by <u>The Builder</u>, an allusion to the eternal home of heroes in Norse mythology) is a series of life-size portraits of famous artists. These portraits, executed in mosaic, were made to fit into the arcade niches that ran round the upper level of the South Court of the Museum. The Valhalla included not only painters and sculptors, such as Leonardo, Michelangelo and Donatello, but also figures from the applied arts such as the potter Bernard Palissy. The project had a self-validatory function: it reflected the established canon of great artists, predominantly those of the Italian Renaissance, whose work the museum was collecting where possible. But by including craftsmen within the pantheon, Henry Cole and the South Kensington Museum modified and expanded this canon, asserting their belief in the connection between the fine and applied arts - a tenet which lay at the heart of the institution. \n\nA number of established contemporary artists were approached to produce highly-finished oil-painted portraits on which the mosaics could be based. As early as January 1862, Daniel Maclise was offered a payment of \u00a370, although his name does not figure among the artists whose work was eventually translated into mosaic. Also invited but not ultimately to participate were William Holman Hunt, Ford Madox Brown and, perhaps most surprisingly, James McNeill Whistler. Of the participants, Frederic Leighton, E.J. Poynter and G.F. Watts were the highest profile painters commissioned for the project, with Val Prinsep, F. R. Pickersgill, Charles West Cope, Eyre Crowe and William Frederick Yeames, all historical genre painters, in the next rank. \n\nIn addition to these external commissions, a high proportion - almost a third - of the artists involved in the project were employed by the Museum or the School of Art. Godfrey Sykes, who designed two portraits (although only one was used), had been recruited by Henry Cole in 1859 to assist with decorative schemes, and became a key figure in the decoration of the Museum buildings; he devised the elaborate scheme of decoration in the South Court. Sykes's principal assistants, Reuben Townroe and James Gamble, both designed Valhalla portraits (although only Townroe's was used). Francis Moody, who designed three portraits, was employed at the Museum as another of Sykes's assistants, helping to carry out the decoration of the Museum and heading a team of student workers. Richard Burchett, who designed four portraits, was the Headmaster of the Art School at South Kensington, and Eyre Crowe, who designed two, had acted since 1859 as occasional examiner and inspector there. Richard Redgrave, responsible for one portrait, was the first Keeper of the paintings collection at the Museum, and held several positions in the Art School including Headmaster. Henry Bowler, also responsible for one portrait, was the Museum's Inspector for Art then later Assistant Director for Art. William Bell Scott, who had taught at the Department of Science and Art-run Newcastle School of Art for twenty years, acted as an examiner in the 1860s. \n\nThe Valhalla itself includes many famous artists, but there are also one or two of some obscurity. Phidias and Apelles were the pre-eminent sculptor and painter of Greek Antiquity. The rest are European artists of the Middle Ages and later, mostly painters. The sculptors include Nicola Pisano, Ghiberti, Donatello, Luca della Robbia, who specialised in glazed and coloured terracotta sculpture, Michelangelo and the English Grinling Gibbons. Jean Goujon was a 16th-century French sculptor who worked on the earliest part of the Louvre. There are only three architects, and all, oddly, are English: William of Wykeham (who was in fact a patron of architects rather than a practitioner), Inigo Jones and Sir Christopher Wren. \n\nThere are also three ceramic artists. Fra Beato Giacomo da Ulma seems almost unknown in art history outside this Valhalla, but is said to have been a Dominican Friar of the late 15th and early 16th centuries who painted on glass at Bologna. Better documented are the majolica painter Maestro Giorgio of Gubbio and Bernard Palissy, the French potter of the 16th century, known for his enamelled earthenware encrusted with modelled reptiles. Three metalworkers might equally well be regarded as sculptors: William Torrel, who made the bronze effigies of Henry II and Queen Eleanor in Westminster Abbey in the 1290s; Torrigiano, the Italian Renaissance sculptor who made the monument to Henry VII and his Queen in the Henry VII Chapel in Westminster Abbey; and Peter Vischer of Nuremberg, who made the bronze monument to St Sebald, in the church of St Sebald in Nuremberg. \n\nNetherlandish art is represented solely by Lancelot Blondeel, sculptor and painter of Bruges; a design for a portrait of Jan van Eyck by Francis Moody seems never to have been executed. There are ten Italian painters of the Renaissance; one German, Hans Holbein; and one Spanish, Vel\u00e1squez. The two English painters are Hogarth and Reynolds. \n\nWhere possible, artists were matched with sitters appropriate to their own work. So Leighton was commissioned to paint Cimabue, the subject of his first major work, <u>Cimabue's Madonna carried through Florence</u> which had brought his work to prominence for the first time when it was shown at the Royal Academy in 1855; Edward Armitage, a vigorous promoter of mural painting, was commissioned to paint the greatest muralist of the Italian Renaissance, Benozzo Gozzoli; and Poynter, who had made his name with compositions of classical subjects, was matched with the Ancient Greeks Apelles and Phidias.  \n\nBecause of the uniformity demanded by a large portrait series, the artists' poses and gestures are mostly invented. The faces, hair and headgear are mostly derived, or adapted, from printed sources, in particular the woodcuts which illustrate Vasari's <u>Lives of the Artists</u>, or in the case of later artists, engravings after portraits or self-portraits. The costume details of the Italian Renaissance artists are taken from one of the published compilations of historical costume which were popular with historical genre painters, whilst the costumes of later artists is usually taken from printed portraits. \n\nThe mosaics themselves remained in place in the South Court until 1949, when they were taken down and stored. Some are now on display in other galleries of the museum. Currently the paintings made as full-scale designs for these mosaics are displayed in various locations in the Museum, including the Lecture Theatre, the staircase to the west of the Grand Entrance and the landing outside the entrance to the National Art Library.",
