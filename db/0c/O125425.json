He was most admired for his poetic effects of sunrise, sunset and moonlight (Orrock wrote in 1898, 'As a painter of light he has had no rival, save and except Cuyp'), and also for his classical landscapes inspired by the works of Claude. Exhibited four oils at the RA between 1800 and 1802, and another in 1821, and 19 at the BI 1820-43. But he was almost exclusively a painter in watercolours. A founder member of the OWS 1804/5, he exhibited there each year for the rest of his life - a total of 581 works. Thirty watercolours are in the V&A collections. Published <i>The Theory and and Practice of Watercolour Paintings,</i>elucidated in a series of letters (1840). Bury states that he visited Italy. Died London 19 March 1842. His self-portrait is in the National Gallery of Ireland.\n\nLIT: J Orrock 'George Barret', <i>Art Journal</i>1898, pp129-32; B Webber <i>James Orrock, Painter, Connoisseur, Collector, </i>2 vols, 1903, I, pp135-46; A Bury 'George Barret Junior: A Classic Water-colour Painter', <i>Connoisseur</i>CV, 1940, pp237-41; 'Some Letters of George Barret, Junr ...
