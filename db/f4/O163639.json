            "public_access_description": "Snuff, or powdered tobacco, was widely popular throughout Europe from the 17th century. Sniffed from the back of the hand, from pinched fingers or from a spoon, snuff was enjoyed on social occasions and would be placed on the table or passed around a group. Thousands of small portable boxes to contain the powder were made as personal accessories, often in novel designs, to be given as gifts.\n\nShoe- and boot-shaped snuff boxes were made throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. Shoes have long been associated with love and marriage and were often given for good luck. This finely carved snuff box features an intricate design of foliage and love hearts. On the front of the shoe beneath a carved 'buckle' are two love hearts speared together by the same arrow, so this box may well have been given as a love token. Unusually, the lid of the box is placed loose on top, rather than being hinged or sliding in grooves. This suggests that the box may have functioned as a table piece rather than a personal accessory. Although softwood was one of the cheaper materials used for snuff boxes (the most expensive ones being made of jewelled gold and silver), the fine carving would have made this highly desirable.",
