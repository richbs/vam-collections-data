The skirt is gored, though the whole breadths are not cut away, and is pleated at the centre of the back. The matching jacket has a turned down collar and long sleeves arranged in puffs which diminish slightly towards the wrist.  It has an attached belt trimmed with loops and a silk waist ribbon. Bodice and jacket are lined with silk.  The dress is remarkable for the quality and variety of its faced and applied decoration. There are faced slits which stiffen the collar, leaf shapes on the jacket, petal shapes on the bodice and a deep scalloped satin border with a padded hem. \n\nThe matching jacket would make the dress suitable for less formal occasions.",

The multiple puffs of the sleeve are similarly inspired. Such historicism in dress is typical of the Romantic period of the 19th century. The jacket covers the arms and neck and makes the outfit suitable for day wear. When removed, it reveals a short-sleeved, low-neck dress that would be appropriate for the evening.",
