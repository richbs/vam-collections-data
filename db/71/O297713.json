The V&A commissioned this reproduction for its 2005 Modernism exhibition. The suit illustrates the deep concern held by European modernists for finding an appropriate model of clothing for the new era in which they were living. The suit is based on surviving Rodchenko drawings, photographs and on the Rodchenko Room Project (2003) of the Museum of Modern Ceramic Art, Gifu.\n\nRodchenko's original two-piece outfit was made by his wife Varvara Stepanova (1894-1958). Its simple, sturdy construction and plain wool fabric were intended to suggest connections with the worker. The design was practical for active work and the harsh climate of the Soviet Union.",
