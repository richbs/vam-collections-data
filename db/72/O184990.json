The elections took place between the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and the reunification of East and West Germany.\n\nThis poster addresses the partnership since 1949 between the CDU (Christian Democratic Union) and the SED (Socialist Unity Party of Germany) - which had been the ruling party in the communist GDR. The text states 'SED + CDU - partners since 1949. Make your honest choice for SPD'. The poster is an example of the SPD's retaliation against the aggressive smear campaign undertaken by the Alliance for Germany coalition parties.\n\nThe history of the SPD within the German Democratic Republic (GDR) ended in 1948, when it was forced to merge with the KPD (Communist party of Germany) to form the SED ('Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands - 'Socialist Unity Party of Germany'). The SPD was newly established (initially as the SDP) on the 7th of October 1989 - the anniversary of the founding of the GDR. For the election campaign the SPD was supported by its sister party in West Germany. One of the main arguments for voting for the SPD was the fact that the CDU-East (Christian Democratic Union) had been the partner of the SED since 1949 as a satellite party within the National Front. However, the SPD parties did not communicate a determined intention for German reunification \u2013 as the CDU did. This accounted for them losing the absolute majority they aspired to. On 26th of September 1990 SPD-East and SPD-West united.",
