Upper 1.5 cms. plain weave with brown weft then 1.5 cms. plain weave with white weft turned under and stitched in place with brown wool.  At the turn there are 12 blocks of 2 rows of red and blue soumak, between which there may have been loops to be used to secure the bag.\n\nDESIGN: Field: dark red ground with 6 rows each containing 6 guls.  In the centre of each is a quartered hexagon mostly in dark red and dark blue, occasionally in dark green, with a triangle in each quarter.  The hexagon lies within a dark blue stepped cross quartered in red and white.  In the lowest band the cross is quartered alternately in red and dark blue ie. without white.  The secondary motif is offset between the guls in 5 rows of 5 and 2 half motifs.  This motif is a quartered hooked diamond in mainly dark red and dark blue, occasionally in dark green; each quarter containing a triangle.  The hooks are paired diagonally in red and mainly dark blue, occasionally dark green.  The hooks are decorated with further hooks in yellow or white.\n\nMain border: dark blue ground with a floral meander in red and dark red decorated with white and yellow.\n\nInner and outer borders: diagonal blocks of ladder-like lines in all colours on a red ground.\n\nOuter side borders: undecorated dark red.\n\nLower band: incomplete; three bands of floral sprigs alternating in dark green with yellow flowers and dark blue with white flower to form diagonal bands rising from the lower left.\n\nUpper band: dark red ground decorated with part of what was probably a floral meander design.  Heat-shaped V-motifs are visible.",
