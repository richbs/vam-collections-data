The form is influenced by Europe, but the technique of setting the stones which relies on using the purest gold, is indigenous to the subcontinent. The stones covering the back of the bowl and all sides of the stem are rubies, emeralds and diamonds, and the design derives from the decorative art of Safavid Iran. It was probably made in the Mughal court workshops in about 1600 and was bought by the museum in 1910 from the well-known dealer Imre Schwaiger for \u00a3353.",
