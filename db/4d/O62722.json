The ballet was based upon Esther Forbes' eponymous novel.  The scene shows the trial of Doll for witchcraft.  \nHoward designed the costumes and collaborated on the scene design with Norman Adams. This group of drawings (S.641-2001, S.642-2001 and S.643-2001), stressing groupings and atmosphere, would seem to be in the nature of choreographic studies, not set designs, capturing groupings and atmosphere.\nThe drawing came to the Museum from Maude Gosling, the dancer Maude Lloyd, who was a close friend of Andr\u00e9e Howard.\n\nHistorical significance: Although not in Howard's usual style, it must be assumed that these are her drawings highlighting groupings and atmosphere for various scenes in the ballet and, along with the related pages containing a 'storyboard' and an outline of the scenario, are rare insights into the creative process.",
