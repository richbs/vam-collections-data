This species has an extremely large range and originates mainly from central Africa and the South Asian Continent. The artist however has remained unknown.\n\nThis drawing was originally part of Cassiano dal Pozzo\u2019s Museum Chartaceum (Latin for \u2018Paper Museum\u2019; now Windsor Castle, Royal Lib., and London, British  Museum). \nCassiano dal Pozzo (1588-1657) was a renowned scholar and patron who assembled a vast collection of paintings, medals and books but also drawings and in particular drawings of antiquities and natural history subjects.\n\nThe drawings were commissioned from major and minor artists, including Pietro da Cortona, Pietro Testa and Vincenzo Leonardi, as well as collected from other sources. Cassiano\u2019s intention was to form a visual encyclopaedia of the ancient and natural worlds but his project was never published. A group of drawings were however reproduced in a number of books on natural history, and artists and scholars drew on its fund of images of the Classical world. (See other examples in the collection: E.2777-1962, E.426-2009 and E.1026-2011.)",
