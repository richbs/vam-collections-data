The village of Castell is located in the remote area called the Texas Hill Country. During 'deer hunting' season many hunters come to the Hill Country. They have become one of the main industries in this area. While I was photographing the church, one of the parishioners told stories of generous gifts of money for the church from a hunter who was passing through.'",
