Most of his major works, for instance, the monochrome wood statues on the high altar of the Ulm Minster of about 1474-81, or the monumental stone figures for the Mount of Olives in front of the Minster do not survive. The busts of the choir-stalls  in the Minster (about 1470), the Blaubeuren altarpiece (1493-94), and several small-scale sculptures do however give a  clear picture of his contribution to the development of Late Gothic Sculpture in Ulm.",

New evidence has shown that the bust was part of a figure which entered the Kunstkammer of Rudolph II in 1609 when it was described together with the figure of Adam as \"Zwy kunstlich von holtz geschnitzte bilder, Adam et Eva, hat der Hainhofer von Augsburg hierher kommen lassen und hat derselben Ihr Mt verehrt anno 1609, beisammen in einer Schubladen\" (two virtuoso carvings in wood, Adam and Eve which has Hainhofer from Augsburg given to her Majesty \nin the year 1609, both are preserved in a box)",
