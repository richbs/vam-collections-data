            "physical_description": "Scroll of embroidered silk showing a willow tree, kingfisher and swallows\nis a typical example of the kind of fine embroidery work that enjoyed a flowering at this time. It depicts a willow tree with a peony flower growing at its base. Swallows, a kingfisher poised as if ready to dive and a pair of cranes complete the composition. Like Chinese scroll paintings it probably would not have hung permanently on the wall, but was brought out at certain seasons and admired for a while. This type of picture is very much a part of the interior design scheme of a well off household. The challenges of creativity were rather differnrntly inflected in China before the twentieth century. The fact that it is painted with silk threads is evidence that it is not a slavish copy but rather a wholly acceptable way of honouring the original artist.",
