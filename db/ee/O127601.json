The vest as an item of clothing may have developed from the ceremonial vest known as the xiapei. \n\nThere is a missionary link to this vest as it was probably brought back from China by a missionary with the China Inland Missionary Society, Ebenezer Mann. \n\nFrom photographs of women taken in the late 19th to early twentieth century, we know that the ruyi cloud motif was one widely adopted in the design of women's dress then. Interestingly, the clothes depicted in some colour-tinted photographs often match the colours this vest was made in.",
