It consists of large lozenge-shaped compartments formed by long  pointed and serrated leaves in light yellow and light brown, each leaf carrying a small blue bird. The leaves come from yellow palmettes. Each compartment encloses a large medallion in red, marked with floral stems and they have similar stems grouped around them.  There is a border in red filled with stylised plant forms; it has an inner and  outer edging both in light yellow decorated with rows of rounded motifs alternately in yellow and brown or red and green.\nEmbroidery threads: 2S silk; pink, cream, light blue, dark blue, yellow, pink faded to beige, light brown, blue, green and black.\nThis is a revival of an earlier style. See Jennifer Wearden in 'Azerbaijanian Embroideries: A Synthesis of Contrasts' in Hali Issue 59, October 1991 pp.102-111.  \nSee also 931-1889 which is probably from the same workshop.",
