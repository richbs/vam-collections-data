In her initial studies, Potter sometimes departed from her signature light palette. This watercolour expresses the moody and romantic quality of the Lakeland scenery \u2013 often associated with the Romantic poets. \n\nThe study was later used by Potter to serve as the background for the frontispiece for The Tale of Pigling Bland (1913). Two pigs were added in the foreground, Pigling Bland and his brother Alexander on their way to market.\n\nBeatrix Potter (1866-1943) is one of the world's best-loved children's authors and illustrators. She wrote the majority of the twenty-three original Peter Rabbit books between 1901 and 1913. The Tale of Peter Rabbit (Frederick Warne, 1902) is her most famous and best-loved tale",
