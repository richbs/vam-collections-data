The kiosk has four pillars which are square at the base and then half way up change to octagonal and lead to a roof with eaves and a dome. The most striking element of this structure are four incredibly intricately carved stone brackets on each side of the kiosk. There are eleven bands of decoration carved on either side of each bracket. The serpentine brackets emanate from makara (open mouthed crocodile like creatures).\n\nThe kiosk stands in front of a bigger building, plainer than other buildings surrounding it, and has had several different functions ascribed to it. It is popularly known as the Ankh Michauli (blind man\u2019s buff house). On the right hand side is the Diwan-i-Khas.",

According to Rizvi it is likely to be the place where Akbar or his principle treasurer sat and distributed coins to subordinate officers or to the poor. The photographer, Samuel Bourne calls it the Temple of the Guru, probably referring to  another popular notion of it as a place where the visiting or resident Hindu holyman/yogi sat.\n\nThe kiosk is three meters square, it has four pillars which are square at the base and then half way up change to octagonal and lead to a roof with eaves and a dome. The most striking element of this structure are four incredibly intricately carved stone brackets on each side of the kiosk. Derived from Jain/Gujarati  architecture, for instance at Mount Abu. Also similar to toranas, ceremonial Hindu doorways. There are eleven bands of decoration carved on either side of each bracket. The serpentine brackets emanate from makaras (open mouthed crocodile like creatures).\n\nThe kiosk stands in front of a bigger building, plainer than other buildings surrounding it, and has had several different functions ascribed to it. It is popularly known as the Ankh Michauli (blind man\u2019s buff house) and romantically described as the place where Akbar played hide and seek with the women of his harem. Nath  believes it to be the Diwan-I-Khass or hall of private audience while Rizvi states that it is the Treasury of gold and silver, hence the kiosk used to distribute coins.",
