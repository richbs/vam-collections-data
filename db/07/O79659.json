The jewellery worn in towns, which is often Ottoman in style, is frequently very different from that worn by the nomadic Bedouin, whose characteristic silver jewellery is much better known today.  \n\nThis necklace was described as a \u2018hirz\u2019 when it was acquired by the Museum.  The word \u2018hirz\u2019 means an amulet case, and refers to all three pendants.  Although there is no evidence that any of them ever opened, or indeed contained anything at all, the shapes alone were considered sufficient to act as a defence against evil powers.  The necklace was bought for seven shillings at the International Exhibition, London, in 1872, as an example of traditional Syrian jewellery.",
