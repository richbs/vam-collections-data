The design was developed from Regency centre tables, which also incorporated dolphins into their supports and bases.\n\nPeople\nHenry Eyles, who designed and made this table, was an upholsterer in Bath with premises in 31 Broad Street, in 1851 and subsequently at 7 Margaret's Buildings. He may have been connected with T.G. Eyles, a cabinetmaker, at 13 James Street, and George Eyles, a carver, of 4 Chandos Buildings. Both were listed in Bath street directories in 1860.\n\nHistorical Associations\nThis table was exhibited by Henry Eyles in Class XXVI (Furniture) in the Great Exhibition of 1851. It was clearly designed to attract a great deal of attention and to demonstrate the creative imagination and practical skills of the designer and maker. The technical ingenuity and combination of materials are typical of much of the furniture shown in the Exhibition.",
