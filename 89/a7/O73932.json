The enamelling would be completed before the lac was added, and the stones would then be set into the piece using kundan \u2013 highly refined gold that can be pressed into place by the jeweller\u2019s tools without using heat. \n\nThis piece was one of a small group bought by the V&A in 1922 and 1923 from a Mr Talyarkhan, who said he had purchased them from the Maharaja of Jaipur in Rajasthan, north-west India. Mr Talyarkhan noted that the piece had been made in Jaipur, a renowned centre of enamelling, but this cannot be verified.",
